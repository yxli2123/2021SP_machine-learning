    6 month olds favorite book

  Let me tell you why my 6 month old son(and we his parents) love this book so much.For starters, it just flows. Most other baby books are so scattered. You’ll somehow memorize this book after 2-3 times you’ve read it.Minimal text! And it keeps the same pattern of words but changing the animals out.It’s colorful!! Big animals on the pages and nothing else.It’s small and compact and a board book so no papercuts.  Plus the quality of this book is nice and thick and holding up nicely after excessive use.Go ahead and get Polar Bear, Polar Bear, and Panda Bear, Panda Bear while you’re at it.I’d pay more than we paid for this book- it’s a staplepiece to a babies library.

  This is one of our favorite books.  We have printed out pictures of each of the animals in the book, laminated them, and then hide them in my 3 year old's bedroom with a removable tacky putty.  I move them around as she remembers where they are, but as we read the book, I ask her to find the animals.  I also made her binoculars by putting colored paper around two toilet paper rolls that I hot glued together and attached a string at one end to go around her neck, when monitored.  She loves it and it makes the book and story that much more enjoyable.  The hard board book is very durable and great!

  This book has been almost a daily read for my baby. From infant until now at 15 months my baby has loved this book and already able to say most of the words. This book is interactive(theres a slide-and-read version as well), rhythmic, it expresses shapes, colors, you can introduce the names of the animals, & the sounds the animals make. My baby sings ""brown bear brown bear"" whenever he sees the book on the shelf or around the house.

  I have always been a fan of anything Eric Carle, and this was no exception. I haven't read as much of Bill Martin Jr.'s writings, but what I have read I enjoyed. I can remember reading this book to my younger brother when he was little, and now I get to do the same with my son. The illustrations are so unique and eye catching. I really like this book because it also helps teaching the names of many types of animals. It is a good length for a quick story, but long enough that you may not have to read more than one. The phrases is this book flow nicely, and always make my son smile. If you are just starting to find books for you little one, this is a good choice, as well as

  This wonderful book with colorful pictures will make a reader out of most children.  You read the book with the child a couple of times.  Next thing you know the child is reading the book.  In the back are some basic comprehension exercises. These tasks assure you that your child can read and does not have the book memorized.  Instead the child knows the names of the individual words.

  Its hard to find books newborns and infants... They wont really pay attention to many books, and I have PLENTY that I have tried. I started reading this to my son starting at 1-2 months and he has loved it! He is now 7 months and loves it too! Its short, sweet, and has a cute rhythm to it (does not rhyme). The pictures are vibrant enough to catch his attention and not overly cluttered. There is just one animal on each page and babies love that... Clear outline of an animal. I have other books with seemingly pretty illustrations that are bright and colorful but my son could care less about those.I highly recommend this book and even buy it as gifts for new moms! It is a classic for every nursery.Also, I want to note that I dont get sick of reading it over and over...

  So the story is a classic, that’s not debatable and that is not what my 3 star rating is about. My issue is the make of the book. This is obviously a book for toddlers and it is described as a board book. However, board books have thicker, CARDBOARD (hence the BOARD in board book) pages that are easier for little hands to turn. This anniversary edition has durable pages that are laminated and thicker that standard children’s books, but they are much thinner than typical board book pages and thus more difficult for toddlers to manipulate. I don’t like it. I have noticed other publishers going this way with their board books as well and I don’t understand it.

    Board book without sliding panels
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Celia Redmore,2018年4月2日 在美国审核,"









  
  
    
  Nicely sized board book for very small hands. Just to be clear, since there seem to be rather a lot of variations of this book, ISBN 978-0805047905 is a board book with no sliding panels. That's probably just as well since those things tend to jam when handled by toddlers, but It's nice to be sure exactly what you're getting with each version.

  A huge boardbook ""Brown Bear...""  how have I lived without this awesome book?  Ok overly dramatic I know, but this book is great.  They were using it for baby story time at our local library and I took a snapshot of the ISBN and was so happy to find it on amazon.  Both my kids can sit together and read it without fighting over who gets to hold it-it's big enough to fit on both laps!  My daughter also brought it in to her kindergarten class as a read aloud book and it was very easy to hold while showing all the students the pictures.The repetitive wording and rhythm makes it great for kids learning to read and the pictures are just amazing!  Also wonderful for teaching/reviewing colors with your kids. There are also tons of activities that can be done with this book including nature walks, coloring activities, sorting activities and the list goes on and on.  I wish all of Bill Martin Jr and Eric Carle's books came in this extra large board book style.

  I've had 3 kids and they all stayed home until they were 5. My first and second are 6 years apart. My last 1 there's a difference of 10 and 16 years. Well, with the pandemic my last has been home and not stepped foot inside a real school (virtual kindergarten). Adding to the stress of staying home, I wanted to make sure she was getting what she needed so she doesn't/didn't fall behind. And this book is great for starting off learning how to read, especially if they've never been to pre-k or daycare. She absolutely loves it because she can read it by herself.It makes my heart extremely happy!

  I bought this a week ago and my daughter already brings this over to me each day to read. She’s almost 15 months old and sometimes she does not pay attention to story time with other books. With this she’s interested and engaged. Also, sometimes  when I read it, she starts dancing because the wording is so rhythmic. Also I love she can learn her animals and colors. She already starts pointing and naming some of the animals in the book. I enjoy reading this to her and it gives me nostalgia lol. One of the first books I remember reading as a child was ‘Polar Bear, Polar Bear, What Do You Hear?’

    Does not teach how to read
  
",3.0 ,Royce A.,"Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  This might be a fun book for a pre-reader, but might develop bad habits later on. My daughter easily memorized this book and gave a false sense of her actually “reading”. She looked at the pictures which gave her clues on what the text is saying next which each animal, but she will not always have pictures to refer to when reading college textbooks in the future. In the back of the book it has reading prompts where they had two columns which a photo of red but the next column said brown. I pointed to the word brown and asked her what color this is. She said red because there was a red color next to it. So in the end it doesnt help with good reading habits.

  Cute book that's easy for kids to memorize. I don't like the last page of the story due to having to read across left to right from one page to the next to keep the ani.als seen in order instead of one page at a time like a book should be read. Also don't like the matching section at the end for kids to do due to answers not being on two different pages instead of one page at a time. Confusing to teach kids to read properly like this

  I was looking forward to receiving this board book to incorporate in my 6 month old baby’s bedtime routine (she has 2 other books, but it would be nice to switch it up from time to time). It was delivered damaged, and it’s unacceptable to give this to my baby to even handle. Along the entire bottom edge of the book is a green/yellowish type of solution damage, I hope it’s not some kind of harmful chemical because included in this entire order package were all baby items (Teethers, baby bow headbands, teether freeze pop, etc). I can’t even open the book as it’s fused together on some of those areas. I do like the fact that it was delivered fast, but it’s pointless to deliver a damaged item.

  I gave this to a 20-month old girl who will not let it out of her sight and usually carries it around with her all day. The rhythm of each page is repetitive and easy for the child to lock into. This is one of those books where, when you finish reading it, you are going to hear, ""Again!"". A great book for a toddler.

  This is a great children’s fiction picture book written by Bill Martin Jr. with illustrations by Eric Carle.  Your students will make you read it to them over and over.  It introduces colors and animals in a simple yet imaginative way.  The illustrations are great.  The story asks certain animals what they see to which they answer what they see looking at them. The book finishes with a summary of all the animals that the children have seen.This book could be used in the school setting as an interactive read-aloud. The book has simple, repetitive, rhyming text.  This style of writing will allow students to interact and join in reading the story as they become more familiar with it.  Student can anticipate what is going to appear next in the book. Students can test their memory through recall and can they can sequence the order in which everything appeared. As an extension to the book, students could be asked to come up with their own animal and create a class book following the same structure of Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?.  This is a cute book for all to read and enjoy.

  When my daughter was about 2, she didn't like sitting still for a story and the baby style picture books were too boring for her, but the rhyming text of this book caught and kept her attention. After a while she would turn the pages faster so I stepped up my reading and it became a fun game. We soon both had the book memorized. Now, two years later, she ""reads"" this book to me. This is a definite must have book and one I'll be giving as a gift to all of my friends and family with little ones.

  This book was one of my favorites as a kid so I just got it for my 16-month-old for Christmas along with a couple other Eric Carle board books. My son loves it and repeatedly pulls it off his shelf and wants it read over and over. His favorite part is the last page with all the animals on it so he can point to each one. The book itself is good quality and is a good size for throwing in the diaper bag.

  We loved this book!! I read my 5 month old at least one book a day and let him touch the pictures as he listens. He also likes to try and hold the books I read to him. Sometimes the books are bigger than he is and the pictures are a little too much for him right now being so young. At first I was disappointed because this book seemed larger in the pictures, but all my concerns went out the window when my son easily picked this book up on his own and started studying the pictures. It’s small enough and light enough for him to hold and the pictures are not overwhelming to him. He always loves story time, but he seems especially excited about this book. Of course I loved seeing him enjoy it as much as I did when I was a kid, and sharing a small part of my childhood with him. This book will also come in handy when he’s ready to start reading on his own, and I’m positive that it will last that long, because it’s good quality.

  This a fantastic story to teaxh little ones colors and slightly bigger ones to start reading.

    Colorful, Educational and Entertaining Book
  
",5.0 ,,"Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2013","









  
  
    
  If you want an entertaining book to teach young children their colors, this one is a delight.  I loved reading this book to my young students (18 months through kindergarten) and they paid rapt attention.  They enjoy the colorful and original art.  And they like the sing-song rhyme of the text.While it says the book is for children two to five years of age, I think you can read it as soon as a child is ready for books like 6 months or possibly younger. Young children can begin to learn colors, numbers and letter sounds from birth.  I used to recite the letter sounds with accompanying letter pictures (a for apple) to my sons, and by age age two they knew all of their letter sounds, by three they were reading words and by four they were reading books.  Also did counting and color activities and books with them. They knew the colors by the age of two as I read books like this one to them and played color games with them.Early learning, when done with a non-pressured and joyous, happy approach is wonderful for young children as their minds are so absorbent.  They want to learn, are wired to learn and don't distinguish between learning and play. If they can learn to speak a foreign language in six months at the age of four when it takes an adult years, it is clear their minds are like a sponge at these young ages.  Books that teach while entertain, like this one, are wonderful.  This book is a classic book for young children.

  Everyone loves this book! It is a classic and a must have for every child. This book comes as a hard board book for more durability. This book is written by Bill Martin Jr. And goes through all of the colors of the rainbow and then some. It introduces the youngest readers to their first colors in a fun way. It features animals and does not overwhelm children with a lot of words. The pictures are simple and beautiful. The pages are not busy. Usually the pages feature one thing of mostly one color so it doesn't distract from the lesson.

  My 18 month old loves this book. My husband HATES it. It's very repetitive, which is great for the baby to learn the differences between the animals and the colors. But beware some may get bored reading it over and over. Likely you're buying this because you want the classic book, however, in which case it's a good well-made board book.

  My 14 month old has loved this book for many months now. In fact, out of all of his books, this is the only one that is so beat up that I am going to have to replace it for my next little son, due this spring.  Baby will hand us this book to read to him over and over again. My version is a small board book, a good size for little hands. Pictures are nice, not familiar with the older version mentioned by some other reviews, but my baby enjoys this version just fine. If you only buy a few books for your little one, I highly recommend this one, along with ""Moo, Baa, La La La"" and ""Art for Baby."" Oh, all of the Usbourne ""That's not my....dog/puppy/monkey/etc"" books are good too. These have been big hits with my son, he's enjoyed them more and more as he's gotten older and hasn't tired of them yet.

  I had an Amazon gc, and thought I'd let my son (3) choose from a selection of books and he chose this one. Although he's not what I consider learning to read-age he memorized the book after I read it twice to him, not to mention that there are some word recognition activities after the story. He's very excited about this book. (Although im a phonetic-lesson-believer, they're teaching recognition here these days...) Also nice to pass something from my childhood days down to his. I didn't know about this particular book growing up but  always loved Eric Carle's  artwork.

  I always read this book in my preschool classrooms - 2's, 3's and 4's all loved this book.  I learned the sign language for the colors and the animals and the little ones loved learning this.  So, this was the first book that I bought for my grandbaby.  You know what?  She loves it!  At 10 months she starts looking for it when she gets to our house for a visit.  We read it first with just the words and then again with animal signs and sounds.  So, far it's all receptive learning but she really pays attention.  Lately she's started kissing all of the animals - so cute!  You won't regret this purchase.

  Brown Bear, Brown Bear is a tragic story of a bear struggling to overcome color-blindness with the help of his friends and the reader.In the beginning, brown bear sees a red bird and a green frog. But the tragedy of color blindness soon rears its ugly, technicolor dream-coat head when Brown Bear incorrectly identifies a horse as being blue and a cat as having a purple die-job.This book will have your children on the edge of their seat with suspense. Will Brown Bear overcome this tragic genetic condition? Will he become a black sheep, cursed to travel the prairie alone? Or will he find a family among the loving hands of a kindergarten class?

  I love reading so when I had my son a few months ago I was very excited about reading to him. I didn't begin to read to him until he was about 3 months old and even that, I'd say, was a bit early. He didn't really begin to pay attention to the books until about 4 months old and even then it was only this book by Eric Carle, Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See? I'm not sure if it's the large, simple, colorful pictures but it's literally the only book he actually takes an interest in. It's also great that it's one of those hard cardboard type of books because aside from looking at the pictures he loves to try and eat the pages. Another plus is that the book is easy to wipe down.

",5.0 ,Raschel,"Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2014","









  
  
    
  My almost 3 year old son is globally delayed and has a provisional diagnosis of autism.  He has just started labeling but other than that doesn't do much talking.  When I received this book I printed out the same pictures of the animals in little squares and used Velcro so he could take them on and off the pages.  Whatever page we are on he pulls off that animal and says the name of the animal.  When we finish reading I ask for a picture, frog for example, he then puts it on the frog page and says bye bye frog.  Sometimes I can even get him to tell me what sound the animals make!  We love this book!  Eric Carle is excellent!

  The first time I ever heard of this book, I was reading it to a class full of 4 year olds (so I thought).  The kids knew every word in this book, and I ended up turning the pages while they ""read"" the book in unison to me.  It was so adorable.  I knew at that moment that this would be the first book that I bought for my future children.  And it was.My son loves this book as much as I do.  It's one of the first books he asked for by name.  He chimes in with the colors and animals and ""helps"" me read.We have lots of other Martin/Carle books, but none of them are as special as Brown Bear.

  This is a book that can keep your child's interest for several years.  The pictures are large and colorful which gets their attention at a young age.  I love the rhythm of the words and the repetition of the words which  will help your child  to remember and say them with you and then  he will be able to read the book to himself.  I have given it as a gift for several baby showers to start the babies book collection.  It has always been well received.  You never go wrong buying Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?

Now, it is the first thing he takes from his toy closet, brings it to me and will crawler up, with assist into my lap, plop himself down and take this book and goes through it for what seems at times, for forever.  His favorite pages are the three last pages, the kids, the color squares and the page with all the characters.  Plus the inner covers with multiple small images of all the characters. It will not surprise me if we go through more than one copy of this wonderful book.  Thank you

  There's a reason why this is a Classic... it's a book that any child will love. We started reading it when my son was less than a year old, and it's still one of his favorites now that he's almost 3. The pictures are in vivid color and the rhyme is simple. His favorite page is the last one, where he likes to point around at all the animals and see how fast I can name them for him. We also like to flip through the pages and make the sound of each animal, instead of just reading the story. The board book version means even the littlest hands won't harm the pages, so it will be in our home library for years.

I got the small board book, which is perfect for her and for storage.From many reviews I have read, I know this is not as good as the original 1997 edition, but that is too pricey and can only be gotten second hand.Is there a 12 step group for grandmothers who can't stop buying children's books?

  For a long time, she wasn't very interested in the book. However, I persisted, reading it to her at naptime (under the theory that it was a simple repetitive book and should put her right to sleep) and making the appropriate animal sounds at each page (rarrr for the bear, whinney for the horse, etc.)Now she's nearing two, and she'll read the book with us, making the sounds herself. Not all children are interested in this sort of book, and I understand that it can be hard for some children to relate to it, since the pictures aren't that realistic, but it doesn't take much creativity to make the repetitive book more interesting - similar to ""finding the mouse"" in Goodnight, Moon.

  This version is the best for small children because the pictures correspond to the text on the same page, unlike the original which makes you flip the page to see the next animal. I.e.

  My boy liked this book enough to laugh out loud and tell me ""Again!  Again!""  It's a simple book with repetitive rhymes, but it really is great.  It reinforces both colors and animals, which most 2 year olds are at least familiar with.  I expect this would be one of the first books that he'll be reading on his own since he already knows the animals and colors, and can remember the rhyme.  This is the best Carle book next to ""Caterpillar,"" which is REQUIRED for any child's bookshelf.  (The other Carle books, not so much.)

  This was gifted to me from another mom and I have come to learn that all kids pretty much love this silly rhyme.  They keep the version locked up at daycare and only bring it out when the children are good.

  This book was recommended to me when our daughter was a little behind on the number of words she learned and it is now her favorite book.  I think it is the repetitive nature of it that really helps.  Now she ""reads"" it to herself naming each of the animals.

This one is one of my favorites because I like to make the animal sounds as my son turns the pages for me.  The sounds make him smile, and seeing him smile makes me melt.  His favorite page is the one with the children on it; he’ll turn all the pages until he gets to that one, and then he’ll stop.  This was a great purchase!

  I am a kindergarten teacher.  Students who are just learning to read can ""read"" this back to the class due to the simple repetitive text.  This encourages the student to learn to read the words.I use this to teach basic sign language of colors and animals. I can add a video review and show how to do this if anyone is interested. But, you can type in keywords of sign language & learning and see how simple it is to teach the basic colors in ASL.  Give it a try.

I had never heard of it before, but when I asked him about it he broke into a rythmic rendition (much was hard to understand) of ""Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see?""I immediately ordered a copy and when it arrived he actually ""read"" it to me. This book is so great for kids. He loves to ""read"" it to us quite often and when we pack a bag for an outing this book has become a staple. Now I need to order the rest of the series.

  This was the first book my son learned to read in preschool over 20 years ago and I still have a copy. I now have a 9 month old grandson and after I read it to him the first time, I knew I had to buy a copy for him to have at home as well! He seems to really love the bright colors and the catchy phrases! He likes it so much that when he gets fussy, I can just say Brown bear brown bear what do you see...and it perks him right up! In fact, I usually have to read it 3 or 4 times cause he'll fuss if I try to put it down! We read lots of stories, but he only gets excited over this one! It is definitely his favorite!

  Although our just-one-year-old granddaughter has lots and lots of books, this is absolutely her favorite!  I think it's the simple, colorful, big, bright pictures on a two-page spread.  We add the animal sounds when we read it and she just giggles in delight!  She brings this one to us to be read more often than any of her other books.  She also likes Polar Bear, Polar Bear... but not as much as Brown Bear.  I'm actually buying a second copy so that she can have one at home and one at Grandma's house.

  I bought this book, Runaway Bunny and Baby's First Mother Goose for my first grandchild.  All are classics and should be in every child's library.  Brown Bear teaches animals and colors, and is so easy to ""read"", our children were ""reading"" it themselves at age 2.  It also has a tune that goes with it, though, unfortunately, it is not included in the board book.  All of Eric Carle's books are great, but, in my opinion, this one is the best.

  I almost always read reviews before buying, but Santa forgot to get this for my daughter who is almost 3. She has speech delay, and while she can't read yet, I agree that the words should appear with the correct animal (ie. I see a red bird looking at me should appear on the page with the red bird). But I also miss that is does not say ""Mother, Mother...."" it instead says, ""Teacher, Teacher...."" Okay, so a dad could be reading it, and I know some  kids don't have a Mother, but, if we are talking about keeping it a classic, then it should stay a classic in that respect too. There are lots of books that are about a father and if I were reading to my child (I am a mother) I'd still read it as father. I think I will write in it to fix it. I have done that with many, many books.

  A great book for promoting children's literacy and building their confidence in reading.  Young kids may not be able to actually read the words, but feel like they are reading it from memorizing the catchy rhymes of the book with the help of the illustrations.  My grandson has been ""reading"" this book since he was two and a half years old.  lt is a children's classic.

  I'm building my son's book collection now that's he quickly getting to that age where he likes for me to read to him. This book is always a classic and the rhyming gets his attention really quickly. He enjoys flipping the pages and pointing at the pictures as I read to him. And because it's a board book it can withstand his chewing habit. When he gets older I'll get him the bigger version.

  This book was initially well-received by my toddler, but has since lost some of its luster. Whether the story line or the illustrations, I suppose appeal is subjective, regardless of the age.At any rate, this book goes from page to page, asking each animal what is seen. The response is always an animal of a different color, so the book is educational for its identification of both animals and colors. I like it for that reason.The book is a good one to have in your toddler's library. I recommend it.

I know it was the repetition of the sentences and the pictures that enabled her to read this book in such a short period of time. But she was very proud of herself and I saw that she was looking at the words as she read.Thanks to the person who recommended this version of the book, the pictures match the words on the page, over the more reviewed one that amazon also sells.

  My kids and I adore this book! Because of this I bought it for my 5 month old for Christmas. I just received it today and I'm slightly dispointed with Amazon. The book had clearly already been opened multiple times by the crease on the back of the book, and the edges were ""splintering"" in a way. Overall, the book is in decent condition but I'm greatly dispointed with the fact that my son won't be able to be the first person to you know break open the book, if that makes sense. Oh well I guess.

",5.0 ,RJC,"Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2016","









  
  
    
  Both of my kids love this book - in fact ""Bow Barr"" was probably one of the first dozen words my son learned to say, as he would constantly grab this book and bring it to us to read it.  The book is very simple, but fun to read and colorful.One tip that I've found makes the book even more educational and fun to read is to insert the sound that each animal makes while reading the page.  For example:""Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see? 'Roaaar', I see a red bird looking at me""""Red bird, red bird, what do you see? 'Tweet Tweet', I see a green frog looking at me""... and so onI think my kids look forward to the sound effects as much as the other words ... and on the last page where it reviews what the children see (ie: all the animals) you can quiz them on what each animal says, what color they are, etc.Perfect for any kids age 1-3 in my opinion, but my 5 year old still enjoys it, so that's saying something.

Board books are great for babies for that reason. Paper pages just don't hold up if they want to participate in turning pages.  It is also entertaining to hear how many different ways the book can be read depending on who is doing the reading... everyone has their own style.

  Every child should have a copy of  ""Brown Bear, Brown Bear What Do You See?"" as part of their home library.  This book promotes a child's growth on their path to literacy.  It is repetitive and  predictable which young children thrive on and Eric Carle's illustrations are amazing!  Some are silly and the kids love it!  (like a blue horse or purple cat)I give this book to every young child who is important to me.Great! Great! Great!

  This book is full of colorful pictures that my 1 year old loves. She often asks to read this book specifically during story time and is enthralled by the pictures. It's not exactly an exciting read as a parent, but we add animal sounds to the different pages to make it more enticing. Overall, I would say this is a great book for story time, and would recommend it to other parents looking for something new.

  Brown Bear is one of my favorites books to encourage young children to ""read"".  I bought this copy for a little boy, Michael Paul.  Michael is 2 years, 5 months old.  His mother works for my doctor and I see her often.  She tells me that Michael ""reads"" Brown Bear to her at his bed time.  The story line is simple, the words are repetitious and the pictures give great clues to what the words say.  This gives a child a feeling of reading, a powerful thrill to a non reader.  While teaching first grade years ago, my young students were so fond of this book that they took to hiding it at the end of the school day so they could have it the next day.  I received a lovely note from Mom and Michael thanking me for the book.  I feel that I may have started another youngster on a life of reading!

  Read this story to my own kids and was my grandson's first favorite - the only book he would sit through when he was 5 or 6 months and he would listen as I read it several times in a row.  Not sure if it's the pictures or the repeat rhythm, but he loved it.  ""Brown Bear"" was among his first words :-)I am very disappointed in the changing of words from our old book to the newer one.  The old book has mother as the adult, this has replaced the mother with teacher.  I don't like the transition from making a parent the important person for a child to making a teacher the important person for a child.

We often sing a song with it and use a flannel story as well.Every young child should have this book read to them over and over again.*taken from my review at goodreads

  I sent off this book to an almost-three-year old Great-nephew to help him learn colors and animals. It works. He’s learned basic colors and is familiar with the animals depicted in the book and mightily enjoys reading and reciting the words on every page.The logic of Bill Martin’s delightful poem is easy for him to follow (Brown bear, brown bear, what do you see? I see a red bird looking at me. Red bird, red bird, what do you see?...).  and on through a charming chain of different colored animals until a simple, surprising ending. Eric Carle’s illustrations are wonderful as usual.The book itself is a well-made board book with bright colors and should easily withstand toddler wear and tear.

  My sons got this when he was 15 month.  He loves this book and can mimic the sound of all the animals in this book.  I have no idea how he recognizes all these figures. Anyway, it is a colorful book, which can easily attract baby's attention.By the way, for young babies, I would suggest to get board book instead of hard cover version, which is easy to get torn.

  Bill Martin's classic remains one of the best books for small children. The rhythm is contagious and the text pattern irresistible. Eric Carle's vivid, bold illustration is the perfect complement to Martin's magical text. The book offers opportunity for teaching color names as well as animal names.While there are several charming sequels, none matches the delight of Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do You See?

He will sit and flip through the pages by himself, or bring it to me, for me to read (all be it, not necessarily in order if he is turning the pages).  Highly recommended!!

  I love this book, but more importantly so does my 4 year old.  This version has pictures clues to help early readers learn.  You turn the page to find out what the animal sees...  then the picture goes with the words the child reads.  It is MUCH better than the board book version where you say the animal before turning the page to see the picture.  Love this book!

  Honestly the bear is looking at nothing.  Then you turn the page and something appears out of no where and as large as the bear (instead of the bear seeing it far away)... would not the whole point of this book be for the child to point to the object in the distance and name it before turning the page and seeing the answer?  Just could have been better.  I also did not particularly like the artwork, but that would not have been an issue if the book had been laid out in a useful and teaching manner.

  We were given this book (hardcover) when my children were very small. That's more than 20 years ago. They loved it. We loved it. Somehow it got away from us over the years. Just bought the new version for our granddaughter's 2nd birthday. All these critical teachers are missing the point. Great rhythm, rhyme and colors. Who cares if the words aren't placed exactly right. Does it impair the child in some way? I think not. Great book in whatever format. I would recommend it without question.
