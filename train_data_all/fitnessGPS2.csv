    Battery life is stupidly short after two months of use
  
",1.0,Catherine Mattijetz,"Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2021","









  
  
    
  I have been very dissatisfied with this watch. The first one I was sent didn’t work straight out of the box. Amazon sent me a replacement without any hassle. But I have worn it since November (2 months ago) and it is already losing battery power in one day. Far cry from the 5-7 day battery life promised by the advertisement.

    DISAPPOINTING! Does NOT work as advertised
  
",2.0,Juan,"Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is pretty disappointing! Doesn’t detect my heart beat, doesn’t track my sleep, doesn’t recognize when I’m asleep, and I’ve tried everything they suggest in their website. I’ve placed it loosely, tight, above the wrist bone, below it, I’ve even placed the sensor on the back of my wrist hoping it’d detect my pulse but no! Only here and there it catches it. On top of that, their app doesn’t sync with Apple health, and if you want it to, you have to buy third party apps that cost crazy amounts.I will be returning unless they offer me a better solution.

  Just got my new Fitbit Charge 4 about a week ago.  So far, so good.  A little bit of a learning curve-I had a Charge 2 for the last 3 years & the Charge 4 is a little different.  One of the reasons I got this was because of the GPS built into to the watch w/o having to use your phone.  I also love that it is water resistant so you can swim, shower etc w/o having to remove it.  So I am very happy with these updated features.  Everything else is pretty good too.  But, I will update my review after I have had it a bit longer.

  This device works well some days and then is highly inaccurate other days.  Today, says I did seven flights of stairs when I have actually done none.  The reminder doesn't work consistently, especially when I'm working on the computer.  Seems to think I'm sleeping even though it's the middle of the day.  Steps seem to be quite accurate.  Heart rate is not very accurate, although, I'm in atrial fibrillation a great deal of the time so it seems to have trouble counting my heart beat.  I have a pulse oximeter, so I know it's recording my heart rate sometimes 30 beats per minute lower than it really is.  Good luck with daylight savings time changes!  It's now telling me my heart rate and steps an hour in the future even though the time on the watch is correct.  If you're looking to this device to monitor your health you might want to rethink getting this device.

    Bad GPS accuracy
  
",1.0,Dude,"Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  Don't buy the Fitbit Charge 4. The GPS accuracy is terrible. The attached screenshots show my tracks in Strava based on the Fitbit Charge 4 and the Google Pixel 2 phone. As you can see, when I used the Pixel 2 phone the GPS accuracy is much higher resulting in a more consistent and more true track. The Fitbit Charge 4 produces incorrect results. Just spend another couple hundred and get a Garmin instead. The GPS will actually be accurate.

  Wildly inaccurate.  I bought the Charge 4 because it made it in a lot of the ""best of"" lists (on sites that - surprise - get paid if you click the links) but was immediately disappointed.  If you just want something cheap to wear on your wrist to possibly motivate you to exercise, it's fine.  If you want something to give you an accurate picture of the things you're tracking, go with a Polar or Garmin or Apple Watch.I compared the Charge 4 against a good chest strap HRM and caught the Charge off by as much as 20 BPM.  Often times I would check it and it wouldn't even be reading my heart rate.  And yes, I tried adjusting position and tightness.The touchscreen and the ""back"" button on the Charge 4 are both clumsy and unresponsive, especially if your fingers are wet from, you know, sweat?  The interface is, IMO, ugly and not intuitive.The app is polished and shiny, which is why people like it, but there's not a whole lot of substance to it.  Data sync to apps like MyFitnessPal is dismal.The one thing the Charge 4 has going for it is that it's relatively cheap, but for another 50-60 bucks you can get a tracker from better brands that is way more accurate and packed with way more useful features.

    Disappointed
  
",3.0,Bradley W. Berg,"Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I formerly had a Charge 2 which was simple to use. After it wore out, my decision to replace it with a Charge 4 was motivated by the ""Activity Minutes"" feature. I do not use the GPS function on the watch as I always have my cel phone with me.  The Charge 4 is very awkward to use. It requires swiping left/right, up/down and tapping the face and tapping the side. Some activities, such as weight lifting no longer show up. The application does not seem to allow the user to find out how many activity minutes they have logged during each day, only the amount for the current day. Their may be ways to access this information but who wants to spend hours trying to figure out counter intuitive controls and application. This is frustrating to the point I am considering to replace this new monitor with a different brand.

    An upgrade from my Fitbit Zip but can't recommend
  
",2.0,Maisy ,"Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  I am updating my review to downgrade from 4 to 2 stars.  The reminder to move seems buggy.  For example, it worked just fine until I changed the notification setting for only weekdays.  Now I get no notifications.  The O2 levels while sleeping worked just fine until I was outside my return window.  Now it doesn't work.  Not a huge deal but now I don't know if my Charge 4 has a defective sensor or if there's another reason?  I find the Fitbit troubleshooting to be lacking for this specific issue but appears that maybe only now available with Premium?  I am going to try the free Premium to see if this corrects the issue but honestly, I am not thrilled that something worked and now doesn't.  Overall, I can't recommend until these buggy issues are resolved.My original review:I wanted an upgrade from my Fitbit zip and bought the Charge 4 after some research.  First, I got it on sale for about$20 less than the current list price.  I like the reminders to move every hour. This can be shut off but I think it helps to not remain desk bound for too long.  I really like the sleep tracking if for no other reason than to remind myself to go to bed on time.  I have some work to do in this area. Step tracking is ok and seems consistent for my normal dog walk routes but random steps get added just by moving my arm.I like that it comes with two band sizes - although I think for me the large has too much extra and the small feels like it could have another notch or two to be perfect.While I like that it has GPS tracking, I don't find it to be all that accurate.  For example, when using the bicycling mode, distances that I know through other tracking such as MapMyRide or my car odometer are just way off through this app (it even randomly stops tracking in portions of my ride).  My mph are off too. It is not easy to pause the activity which is why it seems I've gone much slower than I actually have.  GPS also drains the battery like crazy.  I don't think this feature is a significant advantage over my current MapMyRide app so I probably won't use it much.Speaking of the battery,  I like that it can charge in my usb port on computer ( it doesn't charge when plugged in a wall charger apparently, which I find strange).  And because this Fitbit Charge 4 has made me OCD, it really bugs me that the battery never seems to reach 100% charged.  It stays at 99% forever.  I am overall happy with it and might even go for the free trial of the Fitbit premium app just to see what I'm missing.  I hope the battery lasts a good long time.

  There are reviews you read about tech and you're like, that's 100% user error. But battery life, across this many reviews, is 100% NOT user error. A 1-hour run or walk regularly drains my battery 30%+. I cannot count the number of times I've gone out with a battery about half full and the Fitbit is dead before I'm even 45 minutes in. This is probably the 6th Fitbit I've purchased for the family (my 3rd) and this is also the worst. I'm tempted to go back to my Charge 2. So disappointing.

",1.0,J. T. ,"Reviewed in the United States September 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was so excited to get my Charge 4. I bought it in May 2020 and loved it. The free trial of premium was helpful and I ended up purchasing a year's membership. Then just one month after owning my fitbit, the male end of the device broke off so it could not longer connect to the female end of the band, thus making it impossible to wear and use. The FitBit customer service was TERRIBLE. I had to call 4 times before they processed my request to get the fitbit fixed and then it took one month for me to get the new one in the mail. Then just 2 months later the same issue happened AGAIN. Now, I am without the device for a second time - not only am I unable to use the device but I'm unable to use it with my premium membership. Again customer service was so UNHELPFUL. I contacted them again and they wanted the same process of returning it. I asked for a full refund of both the device and the membership however they refused on both. I will never buy from this company again which is so sad because I loved the actual data it provided me. I strongly recommend against this company unfortunately.

  This is the third FitBit I've bought. But the initial experience of getting it set up was so bad that I wouldn't recommend buying one. The problem is that it ships with out of date firmware. So the first couple days on the device you just get a message saying you need to update the firmware or the app on your phone. The problem is that on previous versions they had a problem with downloading large updates on day one, so they chose to trickle in the update over a couple of days, without telling what is happening. So for the first two days you just have the frustration of nothing you try working, and having to spend time searching the forums (where I finally found the answer). I almost sent it back, but it finally started working after a few days. Basically, no respect for the customer's time or experience. What a joke.

  Overall, the watch functions as one would expect. The big issue I have is that the display is too dim to see outdoors. There are 3 settings for Brightness - dim, normal and auto. The dim setting is actually too dim for indoor use. Normal is just too dim to see outdoors. Auto doesn't make any difference. This is my second Fitbit watch I've owned. My first was an Ionic.  Absolutely loved it and the screen function was great. So, I expected the same from the Charge 4. Big disappointment.

  I used this product daily to track by cycling and swimming as well as sleep patterns.  One thing that bothered me is the swimming ""auto-detect"" frequently didn't work and I had to manually start and stop my swimming.  I swim for about 1.5 hours every day (fresh water pool) and expected, after a while, it would automatically detect but it still frequently misses the exercise.  But the biggest issue I have is it died after 2.5 months.  Luckily it was still under warranty and the fitbit technical staff was very helpful and mailed me a replacement which I received in 3 days.  While I like the service (and the product), disturbed it stopped working after only a few weeks.

  I really like my new Fitbit Charge 4 Special Edition for the most part! It synced very easily, maybe because I already had a Charge 2 connected to my iPhone. It looks really nice and came with 2 sets of bands. I have had it for a couple of months now and am still trying to figure out some of the functions as there are more to this one than my old Charge 2. I really like the GPS feature and have it set to only when using the exercise function so the Charge battery lasts 4-5 days before I have to recharge it. The sleep tracking seems to work great and the GPS is good too as long as I have set it up correctly before I go for a walk since I don’t have that totally right yet.  I gave it 4 stars only because I still have functions to figure out. I would recommend it if you don’t mind being patient about figuring it all out.

  Really loved the Fitbit Charge 4 at first.  Used to have a Fitbit Alt HR for years and was excited about the new features of the Charge 4, including GPS.  Early on I had to turn blue tooth on and off daily to get the Charge 4 to sync to my phone.  This was annoying, but not a deal breaker.  However, about one month after first using, the device stopped syncing with my phone completely.  I tried every suggestion the Fitbit website gives to fix this problem but none of them worked.  Apparently, there are many people experiencing this problem from reading the help forums online which made me ultimately decide to return the product rather than exchange it for a new one.

  Well, if you absolutely need a device to track your sleep, then this is it. Other than that, the accuracy is WAY off from the step counting to calories burned. If you do more than basic cardio and it's important for you to know how many calories you've burned, don't count on this device for accuracy. Calories burned involving HIIT, gym workouts, weightlifting, etc. will not be accurately evaluated, BUT if you need a general idea for calories in and calories out, then this can be helpful for a little while.

    Do NOT Buy This Fitbit!
  
",1.0,freddog2020,"Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2021","









  
  
    
  I purchased this Fitbit because it is cheaper than an Apple watch, and all I wanted was a fitness tracking band with an extended battery life. When it first came, I was pleased with the product. It fit well, the bands were easily adjustable, and they provided you with many different bands with the pack. The battery life was not what I expected however, and the screen is extremely unresponsive.This fitness tracker DOES NOT hold up to anything over moderate use. For my profession, I am a firefighter. I am consistently doing physical fitness activity, as well and performing job-related fitness on emergency calls. The watch face initially broke and cracked within 3 WEEKS of purchase! I purchased a screen protector pack, which simply patched the face that had broke. Then, after about 2 months of use, the cheap plastic they used on the ""pebble"" (the actual tracking device) completely broke off and the tracker fell off my wrist, which caused me to almost lose my device. It took about 2 weeks to have the warranty claim through Fitbit processed to replace it.Then, the new ""pebble"" came. I re-attached the band that I had been using, and hoped it was just a fluke device that I initially bought. I put a screen protector on it immediately; but within TWO WEEKS again, the device screen cracked. I called Fitbit and sent in the picture that I have attached to this review (the screen protector was removed to reduce glare and show the magnitude of the crack). Fitbit DENIED my claim and the device is now cracked, the screen is hard to use, and the battery life is extremely reduced. DO NOT BUY THIS! Spend the money on a better tracker, not Fitbit branded. You won't regret it.TLDR;The device is fragile and does NOT hold up well to fitness activities.The screen is unresponsive, and the battery life is substandardThe customer service is awful. They will most likely not cover any warranty claim in regards to how fragile the device is.

  This is great if you want to make a change in your lifestyle. With the companion app you can track calorie intake, water intake, see how well you sleep, all kinds of stuff. It tracks your steps, calories burned, floors climbed, a variety of different exercises. I highly recommend it if you’re looking to become more active and healthy. There’s challenges you can compete in if you want with friends and family. It encourages you to get up and move and reach milestones. It’s a great little device. My one big, huge, complaint is that the bands to not connect properly to the Fitbit. The band it comes with has a huge gap and it looks trashy for something you’re paying a lot of money for. It also looks like it can get caught on something and snap off. I’ve bought some third party bands that connect better. But come on, I expect the third party stuff to be janky, not the stuff you get from Fitbit themselves! Hopefully they fix this issue and issue a recall. But otherwise, the Charge 4 is a wonderful device.

  This is my first ""fitness"" watch and I've had it for one week. Overall I like it and I'm glad I got it.  I enjoy the sleep and heartrate data (except as noted below). On the 50-minute mark it prompts me to get up and move which helps in the sedentary job I have.My disappointment is the poor heartrate accuracy when I exercise. I have 10 year old Polar chest strap monitor that is much more accurate. In the photo I attached, it shows the watch and chest strap readings after sprinting on an attack bike. I did a manual reading and the cheststrap was correct. The watch was 40 bpm below. Of course, this means the calories burned is inaccurate as well unless I manually override it, but I don't want to do that.My sense is that this inaccuracy is inherent in measuring using light on the wrist. I have tried the different straps and changing wrists as suggested online but the problem persists. Honestly, I wish they would just include a chest strap that will connect with the watch/app that i can wear during cardio.

  I bought a Charge 4 two weeks ago, the ""special edition"" with the woven strap and the regular strap, and have had a fair amount of problems with it:- the heart rate is reliably off by 40 or 50 beats per minute if I'm doing any kind of motion-intense lifting. I work out with a sandbag and it's absolutely useless if you are doing something like cleans. I wear it two finger-widths up and relatively tight and it takes about 45 seconds to a full minute to catch my heart rate after a set, even doing something like pushups. In fact I've even had it happen with unweighted body squats. The only exercise where it is almost perfectly accurate seems to be riding a stationary bike. Sweat doesn't seem to be a huge factor as I sweat buckets on that bike and it works great. This is definitely the biggest issue.- the standalone GPS on the Charge 4 takes a long time, 4 or 5 minutes, to initialize, and it's gotten to the point where not using phone GPS is actually a real pain since the app requires always-on location services on the phone for ""Bluetooth low energy scans"" to sync, which seems like sort of a non sequitur anyway. I take my phone on walks so standalone GPS is not an upsell, especially when it's considerably worse than phone GPS.- paywalling the advanced sleep reporting features on an already expensive device. I just can't support this as a business practice.- the additional ""premium"" feature is access to workout videos. The app (on a Samsung Galaxy S10+) has entirely different offerings than the Coach app, but only the Coach app is able to cast to my TV. I did the fitness test on the Coach earlier today, which says at the beginning that it will be a series of exercises with corresponding ratings, and the video shows someone setting rep counts on a slider. The actual video is a monolithic 6 minutes with no breaks between segments followed by a series of smiley faces to self-assess how you did. I probably didn't do super well doing pike presses because I did pushups 10 seconds before, is that a sad face? Was I supposed to pause it? Even as a bundled feature this was pretty disappointing, especially figuring out I was either supposed to watch Fitbit app Discover programs on my phone or pick something totally different from the Coach.- minor stuff: the app is fairly comprehensive but you don't seem to be able to zoom in on graphs or even rotate them to landscape. The watch tends to vibrate too much with various numbers during exercise, some are starred, some are Active Minutes which confusingly pop only in intervals of 22, and I get about 5 or 6 buzzes during an individual workout. Notifications from my phone never worked. The ""relax"" app consistently tells me I'm doing a terrible job even when I'm synced to its rhythm. Lastly the only real differences between the Charge 4 and the Inspire HR are standalone GPS, Active Zone Minutes which is a made-up concept anyway, payments (which are cool), Spotify controls and a slightly larger form factor. Up to you whether that's worth 50 extra dollars.My watch failed to sync for 2 hours tonight and that was the final straw. I'm sure it's great for specific use cases but overall it's not quite there. I had a Microsoft Band 2 in 2014 and the Charge 4 is 0% better than my fitness tracker from 6 years ago aside from aesthetics and construction. Might be good for someone who wants one app for everything, doesn't care a huge amount about the fine details, and only does spinning classes or runs without their phone.

    Warning to Windows 10 users - STAY AWAY
  
",1.0,Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2021","









  
  
    
  Before I purchased a Charge 4 I read many of the reviews but did not uncover that Fitbit refuses to support Windows 10. The Charge 4, Inspire 2, Inspire HR, Inspire, Sense, Versa 3, and Versa 2 can only be set up with a smartphone or tablet - per my work with an support agent at Fitbit.  I was also informed that Fitbit will be pushing an update to the Charge 3 that will make it incompatible with Windows 10.  Since I have found that the smartphone installation seem to be a huge drain on my battery, I do not wish to sync with my smartphone and I do not own a tablet.  I purchased the Charge 4 for my wife and I've owned a Charge 3 for my use for a couple of years.  Fitbit has just destroyed their relationship with me.  Not making it clear that a new product will not work for Windows 10 is bad enough but to break the product that I already own ought to be criminal.  I will make no review regarding the the tracker in relation to smartphones or tablets other than what I said.  Other reviews can speak to that.  I will caution those who want to use Windows 10 to sync their tracker.  Fitbit will not support you and the fact that they are ready to break my tracker with the update tells me that they have nothing but contempt for Window 10 users and they do not want our business.

  The sleep tracking sounds cool..right? And when it works, it is interesting to see your sleep stages and levels of sleep. BUT, in the two weeks I’ve worn it, it has only worked correctly twice for sleep. If you look at the Fitbit forums you’ll see this is an ongoing problem. I’ll sleep all night, but it will only track for a bit here and there..not the over three straight hours it needs for tracking full info. Doesn’t matter where on my arm, how tightly, if I’ve re-synced it the app or whatever other suggestions they have. It is an ongoing problem that the company admits to.Counting steps and most everything else have been great with the watch, I enjoy the gps feature that syncs your exercise to the app, and shows your time in each cardio/fat burn/etc zone. I did have the gps stop a half mile before the end of my walk yesterday, but the battery had gotten down to 17% at that point. Not sure if that was the issue.Overall I like it and I’m glad I purchased it, it was on sale for $99 at the time.

  I've had the Fitbit Charge 4 for over a month and have not had any luck syncing it to my home computer (running Windows 10) or my cell phone (Samsung Galaxy S10e). A support person from the Fitbit website said to buy the Fitbit dongle and then I could sync it to my home computer. I purchased the dongle; still wouldn't sync. When I inquired again about this issue, I was told the Fitbit Charge 4 would only work with my cell phone. THEN WHY DID YOU TELL ME TO PURCHASE THE $20 DONGLE? By the way, it won't sync with my cell phone, either. Fitbit, this shouldn't be so hard! I will be returning the device.

  I had the Fitbit charge 2 and upgraded to the charge 4. Overall I really like it. It has all the same features as the 2 with a few additional features. I really appreciate the option to turn of the screen wake for sleeping. Now it doesn't light up in the middle of the night waking my husband like it used too. The touch button on the side  o did have to get used to. But once you get the finess of it it works really well.One thing I want to share is how to get the ""workout"" option back for your exercise options. Initially I thought they just took it away. But all you have to do is go to the app. Tap on charge 4 to get to the apps. Scroll down and tap on the exercises options. You'll have to remove one. Then tap the add option. The Workout option will be there. Just scroll through to find.

  It’s great for counting steps, but whenever I run the GPS stops or doesn’t start correctly, the Fitbit exits the exercise before I’m done, or it doesn’t record it at all even though I’m watching the pace counter throughout the run. After only a month of use, the Fitbit only occasionally syncs with my IPhone and the app rarely works when I want to make changes to the device.After one month of extensive use, I’m returning this device because it’s not what was described by the company and none of the features work consistently.Outside of using this for a wristwatch and pace counter, the Charge 4 is useless.

I also have an Ionic and it had with the same issue but worked on the second try.

  It is difficult to have the syncing. It keeps disconnecting when exercising/walking and not able to track correctly. For example, the last update I had as of 11/11/20 is on 11/3/20. Since syncing is different for this device, it takes away a lot to stay focused on exercise and diet goals. Even the manual syncing from the setup doesn’t work often times. I have had this Fitbit for over 3 months but not getting better. Also I do update the software when update is available but doesn’t resolve the syncing issue. Sleep tracking is not syncing. What a difference, I purchased a different brand and have had it for a month and working great so far. No syncing issue with the different brand.

  My Charge 2, which was a great fitness tracker and so easy to set up and use,  won't sync any more and needed replacing. I made the mistake of buying a Charge 4. I had to use Fitbit chat to get the device to work. That was a horrible experience. Is there some reason customer service chat people don't bother to read what the customer types?I tried to set a clock face, and there's no way to do that. I would like to set an alarm, but there's no information on how to do that. I'd like to set specific exercises, but I can't do that either.This isn't an upgrade. This is a nightmare. There are supposed to be all these great features, but to access them requires pure dumb luck. There's nothing intuitive, and the instructions - assuming you can accidentally find them - aren't any help.Update: I finally got the Fitbit up and running. I bought this Fitbit because my Charge 2 stopped syncing and the Charge 4 was on sale. It took a few days to get everything set up on the Fitbit. I'm slowly learning how to use the exercise function. I don't need the GPS so I can't comment on that feature. Yes, buy this Fitbit. But...it will take a bit of time to learn how to use this Fitbit.

  70% of the time you will not get notifications about texts on your Fitbit. After going through all the troubleshooting tips over and over, I’m just gonna go back to using a charge 3. Upgraded to a 4 because of the Spotify control but when you have to go in and reset it to recognize your Fitbit and make your Fitbit recognize your Spotify, it’s not even worth the trouble. Going with the charge 4 was the worst Fitbit decision I’ve ever made.

  I went back and forth between a Fitbit and an Apple Watch for months... I was 99% going to go with the Apple Watch, then the pandemic hit. I realized a lot of my friends and coworkers had Apple Watches and they constantly would look at it (I felt it was no different than looking at your actual phone). I stepped back and asked what was the main reason I wanted either of these and it was for step counting, calorie counting, and increasing healthy habits. I’m not really a watch person, and I finally pulled the trigger on the Fitbit and I couldn’t be happier. It covers exactly what I need it for... and it was hundreds of dollars cheaper (let alone any cell phone plan additions you might need).

  PROS1) Very easy and intuitive set up.2) I like that it shows the different heart zones and tracks your workout with it, thus, letting you know the intensity of your workout. This is great for people who enjoy HIIT training or Orangetheory Fitness.3) If you are a data geek, the app offers plenty of ways to see your calories burned, heart rate, and sleep statistics  Very interesting.CONS1) The battery does not last 7 days. I charged it to 100% and lasted 3.5 days. After the recharge, it is at 31% right now, which is two days later.2) The touch screen does not work with sweaty fingers during a workout or if you want to stop a workout.3)  Starting a workout is not very quick. It goes through a “connecting” process which can last a couple minutes.OTHER1) Charge the Fitbit before starting. Make sure it clasps on correctly. I thought I had done it right, but only to find out it wasn’t charging.2) The only difference between the Charge 4 and Charge 4 special edition is the Extra band. I like the band. From what I could tell the band bought separately usually costs more than $20. But if you like one that is less than $20, recommend buying the Charge 4 and band separately.FINAL THOUGHTI’m still on the fence this is the right wearable for me. Will continue to try it out and see how continues to work. The charging is a big issue partly because advertising 7 days of charged capacity is a huge variance with reality of 3.5. Fundamentally, to me, that is false advertising.

   I love this Fitbit. I didn’t know all of the features at first but it’s great. I use it to set alarms and timers, plus change my music, look at my calendar for the day and see texts, it also has a calm option for 2 or 5 minutes to help focus your breathing and heart rate, I usually do it when I’m about to go to bed since I get off work really late and have classes early and usually have trouble sleeping. I was also able to connect it to my Apple Health so it’s can see things like my weight, height, period, etc. Its way more accurate than using my phone for my steps (from a day of work 7000 on phone vs 11000 on Fitbit). I really love it and has made my life way easier.The only negative was I had to wait a few days for the watch to be sent the update so I could access my calendar, Spotify and fitpay. All the other features still worked before and after the update.Also, fitpay requires a passcode to use so if you’re skeptical about that, it can’t be accessed without it so your money is safe. Lastly, it still works great on your ankle, I bought an extender or you can make one (see video) but it still picks up heartbeat, obviously it’s just harder to use the other features when it’s on your ankle but doesn’t mean it won’t work, just harder to reach haha.

  I bought this after I gave up wearing an Apple Watch because of rashes it gave me. I figured Fitbit Charge is indeed a better choice for me.I do miss Siri and some extra features on the Apple Watch, but Charge 4 is much lighter and has a much better battery life. I sometimes even forget that I’m wearing one, which didn’t happen with the Apple Watch. Those two merits are good enough reasons for me to make the switch.Plus, I like sleep tracking, which is a must feature for me, on Charge 4 than the default one on Apple Watch. Charge 4 seems more accurate and Fitbit’s data presentation, especially the sleep score, is easier to digest.For $99 (during the holiday sale), I don’t have to worry too much about damaging it like I did with the Apple Watch.

  I have never been so upset and disappointed with Fitbit. My first advice to you is buy the protection plan. I’ve never had a Fitbit last over 2 years. My last Charge 2 stopped working abruptly, so I used my protection plan to upgrade to a charge 4. WORST DECISION. The charge 4 seems like it’s super fancy and worth the upgrade. FALSE. The last 3 times I’ve charged it, it stops counting my steps. I’ve followed all of the necessary steps to get my charge 4 to send me text notifications, and it still won’t work. I get phone call notifications just fine, so why not texts? It seems like a lot of people are having this same issue if you go to Fitbit’s help website. Why sell a product with so many bugs? So disappointed. If I wasn’t so dependent on knowing what time it is and wanting my step count, I would throw in the towel with Fitbit altogether.

I fell into the trap of thinking that this device would somehow give me an edge or advantage in my every day life. It doesn’t.I run with my phone, so there’s my GPS tracking/mapping/music. I keep a log of my sleep on my nightstand, so there’s the sleep tracking.  I also participated in a sleep study which yielded completely different and conflicting results than what this device was reporting to me every morning. I have an assortment of wrist watches for most occasions (which all look better than this item). Overall it just slowly became irrelevant in my everyday life over the course of 3 months of “use”.It was a mistake.  Not impressed with FitBit.  Why didn’t I just get an Apple Watch?I could see it being fun for kids who need encouragement to get up, get out, and get active in the form of tech gimmicks...

  The only reason that I bought this was because my FitBit Charge 3 died after only 2 years. The 4 has no updates worth mentioning over the 3. It is still impossible to see in the sunlight, the legacy charge 2 clock face still does not work. Nothing new here folks.  Move on.  Fitbit is going down the tubes.  Oh.....and as an added bonus, they changed the form factor just slightly enough that none of the Charge 3 accessories will work with it. Throw away all of your Charge 3 charging cables and be prepared to buy new ones.....

  I received my FitBit Charge 4 and followed the startup instructions.  After the setup and a firmware update, I am completely unable to get a response from the device.  I let it charge for over two hours, received the smily face, setup mu iPhone, registered and started the premium service, and the device never came back to life.  According to the Fitbit forums, this is a known problem with this model.  My advice is to stay away from this device until this significant problem is resolved.  Fitbit help!

  I was really excited about the Charge 4 when it came out, specifically the internal GPS feature and ability to control Spotify from the tracker.Within like 2 months the GPS stopped working.  I've called Fitbit 3 times troubleshooting and they're finally sending me a replacement, but who knows if that will actually work?The Spotify app is not accessible while you're tracking a workout.  That means, you can either record a run OR control music.  What's the point of that?Really regret this purchase and wish I had gotten a Garmin instead.

  I have been a Fitbit customer for at least the last 10 years and my Fitbit 4 purchase last month was my 4th Fitbit device.  The new Fitbit 4 charge is AWFUL.  The user interface is cumbersome when I head out on a run.  If you use the GPS the charge last about 2 days, and will quit on you in the middle of a run.  Can't check battery level on the device (must use app but don't think you NEED to check when you pulled it off charger YESTERDAY!) .  So I quit using GPS. In daylight the device is almost impossible to read on NORMAL brightness.  Today I ran and my device reported my over 10000 steps and Heartrate - the app didnt update my data and stuck at 49 steps.  Reboot iPhone - same.  ( I have rebooted the watch as well)? Really stupid steps to activate and finish the tracker and confusing ""play"" icon.  They lost me on this  Shipping it back and will lose years of data. (  I bought stock in this company when I first started using the original.)  Really a HUGE disappointment and FAIL!  So disappointed.  The one thing I did like, the Heart rate monitor is better than the prior Charge 3.  Other than that -  POS

  I bought the charge 4 mainly for the step and sleep tracking.The sleep tracking is great. The step. Not so great, in fact horrible. It randomly adds steps while sitting still or while sleeping, even driving.This seems to be a HUGE complaint of Fitbit users and after searching all day, have not found any type answer.I bought it for the mAin purpose of step tracking and with that not working properly, I feel a bit jipped.

  I previously gave this product a 2 star rating because the Charge 4 that I recieved was defective. However, Amazon traded my previous watch for another one and this one works fine. The battery life is better. Mine will last about 6 days and when the battery gets low, the watch will let you know. If you want to save battery life, just don't use the GPS feature when you go outdoors like on your hike, walk, bike, or run. It will still give you all the vital information that you'll want like average heart rate, calories burned, altitude change, mileage, and how long you stayed in fat burn, cardio, or peak heart rate. You can change the watch face to suit your taste, or adjust how bright or dark you want to set the screen. It comes with Spotify which I have no need for, but it does just about anything else that you want. It's not as advanced as an Apple Watch, but after all, this is a fitness tracker and not a smart watch. You can buy additional watch band to suit your taste. Its light weight, and durable. Its also water proof so you can swim with it. I Previously wrote that I won't get another Fitbit, but I was wrong.

  After a couple of weeks, I got a notice to update the firmware.  The update crashed the Fitbit.  Customer support said they'd do me the ""favor"" of giving me a FedEx SmartPost (ha!) ground shipping label.  It took FedEx and USPS more than two weeks to get the Fitbit to them, then Fitbit tells me it'll take up to 10 days to ship out a replacement.  When the do send it out, it'll probably take another two weeks to get to me.  So, aside from the Charge 4 dying after two weeks, Fitbit needs to find a better way to replace their defective stuff in a more timely manner.

  2nd update!!Buy the insurance! My watch snagged the other day and broke the hinge that connects the band 😭I filed a claim and once the reviewed it, it shipped a new one 24 hours later! Excellent accident warranty! Very satisfied!UPDATE: I've had this watch for a few months now, and it has grown on me more! It does still ""shock"" me every now and then but I've noticed if I switch it to my other wrist or just take it off for a little it stops or sometimes I just have it too tight. I figured out how to connect my messages which is a big plus for me. Another bonus I want to add is it's very durable! I've accidentally scratched my watch against the wall while walking more times than I can count (super clumsy) and there's not a scratch on it. I'm still not a huge fan of the choices for clock faces and wish it was more customizable but thats eh. The speckled (fabric) wrist band does need to be washed constantly as it does absorb odors easily so I end up using the standard band more often.I did end up buying the same fitbit for my MIL for this Christmas, as she has been wanting one as well and they were on sale. So there's that. It still lasts a few days which I like and shows the battery life is still good. For what I use it for, I like it!Please give this a thumbs up if this helps, I'm trying to improve how helpful my reviews are!ORIGINAL:It's an okay watch, but there's definitely better out there.Pros: I like the sleek look, not a fan of the circular faces of smart watches.Sleep tracker is useful for keeping track of my sleep schedule without me even thinking about it.Heart rate is pretty accurate.Super easy to switch out the bands.Step counts are more accurate than my phone.Battery seems to last at least 3 days at a time.Charges fast.Cons: leaves electrical burns on my wrist (i don't wear it it water at all) 😬Distance is not accurate if you run, unless you turn on workout and only have it on when running which is a pain since I do interval running.A bit pricey for what it is.Doesn't always turn on when I turn my wrist, especially laying down.Don't like the home button because you have to tap it just right to work it.Have to have Spotify premium to use it with fitbit 😒Doesn't connect with my messages.Overall, it's okay. If the Distance was more accurate I'd be more satisfied with it but it just doesn't meet all my needs. I wish i did more research. Hope this helps!

    Why I'm returning my Charge 4
  
",2.0,CMA,"Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had an Ionic, which I loved.  Sadly, it died after 2-1/2 years, so I was loathe to buy another Ionic.  The Charge 4 seemed to have the features I was most looking for, so I decided to give it a try.  I have a small wrist, and really like how sleek the Charge 4 is.  Today I took the Charge 4 out on a bike ride for the first time.  One of the reasons I bought the Charge 4 (and one of the reasons I loved the Ionic) is that it has built-in GPS for things like biking and running outside.  I biked a route that I have often done, so I know the distance and my general average MPH for the route.  The first bad thing about the Charge 4 is that the display is completely unreadable in bright sunshine.  I had to go inside to start my bike session, because I couldn't see anything on the display in bright sunshine.  What were they thinking when they engineered this display?  I often like to pause my bike session when I'm stuck at a long light, and then start it back up again when the light turns green.  Since I couldn't see the display outside, I couldn't do this.  The second bad thing was how inaccurate the GPS and average mileage were for this ride.  It seemed to drop out for quite some time, even though it was open road (not forested), and, when I downloaded the session, it had me going at a diagonal direction that didn't even exist IRL (that is, it was not on a road).  As a result, the mileage that it showed was not only several miles off, it caused the average MPH to be much lower than it really was.  I'm not expecting perfection from a fitness tracker, but this was way too off to be useful to me.  And not being able to read the display outside was a deal-breaker.  I am returning the Charge 4.  Guess I have to find an alternative to fitbit. Sad, because I've been a fitbit user for many years.

  Should be allowed to give 0 Stars.  Syncs and that is all it did.  Can't get past the setup message.  Called Fitbit and they would replace but have to send the defective unit back and have it received before they will send out the replacement.  Looked like a long turnaround so i just returned it to Amazon.UpdateI really liked the specs and size of this unit so I gave it another chance and exchanged it instead of returning it.  What a waste of time.  I should have googled this problem before I got the second unit.  Lots of people are having the same problem.  So the new unit came and worked, or didn't work, in exactly the the same way as the first.  At least this proves that their quality control is consistent.  I will be returning the second one as well but not getting a replacement this time.  What a shame that a company with such a good reputation can't provide working  products.

  Some reviews are a bit tough on this device, but I really like this tracker.  I was an early adopter with the Microsoft Band fitness tracker which is still way better than most today, but the Fitbit Charge 4 is really good for the $ especially when GPS is included.  I've had the Charge 4 for 3 weeks and I'm really happy with it.  It doesn't have so many bells and whistles which gives it a really good battery life.  Setup and updates were easy - way too many people complaining about this.Pros:Light and easy to wearSpecial Edition - Granite band is awesome - cloth-like band means no sweaty wrist3 - 5 days between charges with using the GPS several times and wearing for sleep.Sleep tracking seems to work well.Easy to navigate the screens - especially for a small screenVery good syncing with my Andriod phone - better than my Fitbit Ionic.Spotify control was surprisingly easy to setup and works well.Sleep Mode works well in Auto but I like to enable it myself so that Do Not Disturb is on too.Cons:Its monochrome - but that's really ok and why the battery lasts longer.My last 3 fitness trackers never made it past 2 years, so I got the extra warranty - just being cautious.The screen can be a little dim (even at Normal setting) - again to save battery.

  I like that this item has motivated me to track more of what goes in and how much effort I expend daily. Seeing nutritional values in little charts helps me be more aware of what I’m eating and how much. It also helps me to realize when I haven’t really moved around too much in a day, so it motivates me to go out and get some steps in and my heart rate going. It even keeps me aware of how much rest I get too, along with the quality of that rest. My main issue with this however, is that I find it a bit inaccurate. When I know all I’ve done today was sit at my desk, I am sometimes surprised that it thinks I’ve walked 1000 steps and I know it’s not true. I work an office job and tap a lot of buttons on a keyboard, so I’m assuming it’s picking up on those taps rather than my actual stepping activity. Aside from having to take it off and put it back on when I know I’ll be at the computer, it’s pretty great!

Simply stated, it presents the most holistic picture you're going to get of your health inside ONE app as a result of wearing ONE fitness tracker.Charge 4 as an Upgrade (i.e. GPS):Specific to the Charge 4, with a note that *ALL OTHER THINGS ARE EQUAL CALIBER TO THE CHARGE 3*, the GPS (which is really the only major new feature of the Charge 4) is good. The GPS takes seconds (maybe 10 to 20) to connect and then you touch the screen and off you go. I wore the Charge 4 and my Garmin for the first few runs to compare tracking (my garmin is a triathlon model, not a fitness tracker model, & used more for races and longer distance running due to battery life) and the GPS paired fairly well across both units. The Fitbit found its satellites far quicker than Garmin, but seemingly gives extra distance when going around corners. I have one corner I hit on my out and back 3 miles runs and the GPS maps indicate this is where the magic happened, but that being said I would usually hit the 3 mile mark on the Charge 4 around two or three strides ahead of my Garmin. No biggie for the shorter/daily training runs. I would say the Fitbit Charge 4 stops being your optimal choice if 1. You are fine with carrying your phone constantly and therefore do not need GPS or 2. you are going to be out doing your activity for 2.5-3+ hours. That's where the battery use for GPS expenditure becomes cumbersome. At a moderately paced half marathon, you're into Garmin/Coros/Suunto/etc.Special Edition or Base:Specific to the Charge 4, the special edition boils down to a unique band, that happens to be absolute junk (with reflective fabric!). The super special band looks a bit awkward with the unit, won't survive sweat for very long without needing to be washed or soaked, and felt & looked like it didn't fully connect into the unit at the clip ins and might randomly separate it tugged on the wrong way. (Could have been mine was defective, I don't know) my recommendation either way- save the $20 bucks, get the basic Charge 4, and if you're into colored/specialty bands, any band that is marketed for the Charge 3 or 4 will work with the Charge 4. I am currently using the Charge 3 special edition band (white rubber with black clasps) on my charge 4. It works perfectly.Out Of The Box: I had no issues with any part of charging it, pairing it, or the firmware updates needed at launch to bring it to current. No black screens of death either.Battery Life:And the battery does die faster when using GPS, but that actually happens to all fitness trackers not expressly made for GPS monitoring. You can't have built-in GPS tracking on a unit THIS size, with ALL the fitness tracking features it has, and expect battery to last a full week. With active GPS use for an activity a day plus all day & night wear/fitness tracking, I'd estimate you'll get 3 to 4 days out of each charge.

  For the most part, an OK tracker. So far has done a good job with steps, connectivity and reminders. Heartrate is for the most part accurate as well.The stairs/floors data is a mess. Begining it seemed pretty good. Only off by a floor or two each day. Over time this has changed to wildly innacurate. Floors are being counted at 4-5 times actual number! Fitbit solution is to tell the tracker you are driving and it will not count floors. They blame it on opening doors and breezes!

  I'm really disappointed. The features of the Fitbit are great, but...there are problems.1. It's only been over a week, and the Fitbit is scratched up. I'm very worried now that a month into it, I can't wear this out on a normal day as it'll look terrible. It'll only be used for working out.2. So, I bought the Fitbit for two main reasons. To track my calories/expenditure and to track my sleep. I'm very disappointed that apparently I'd have to pay for a monthly subscription after 90 days (which is the amount of time for their free trail).3. This is a bit minor, but it seems you cannot log your food calories for previous days. Also, it does not estimate your Body Fat %. You have to add that in yourself.

  In a few words, I am disappointed by the quality. Don't believe me, just Google ""fitbit charge 4 gap"".It's not that the product is totally garbage, it's just that I expected for better quality ...This is the ""3rd generation"" of Fitbits running in my family (this time I bought 3). This is the first time that I wish I had chosen differently...The strap is not tightly connected to the watch (there is an ugly gap) , reading tons of other's complaints I am lucky that it's remaining connected.All other parameters are as expected, but as the watch is sitting on your hand all day, it turns out that a good fit between the parts is quite important...BTW, so far Fitbit takes responsibility and replaces faulty watches for other faulty watches, but I would suggest to wait until they actually solve the problem (and hopefully initiate a recall), or order the Fitbit charge 3.

  Love this Fitbit. One thing to be aware of- I didn’t notice in the picture that the center piece of the watch is the same color as the band.  I chose plum thinking the center was all black like the other Fitbit I had.  It’s fine with the original band but if I switch to a other color than I’ll have a two tone watch, which I don’t love.  In hindsight I would have ordered the black one so the bands match better.  I’m also one of the small percentage of people who can feel tbe heart rate sensor on their arm.  Feels like a slight sting.  This device is better than one I’ve had in the past and only feel the sting intermittently.  Overall I love this Fitbit.

  I love my Charge 4 Fitbit but what I don't like is that the battery life isn't really 7 days. I've had it for about 2 weeks now and the funny thing is the 2nd day I misplaced the charger. That morning I went running and came home it was gone and my Fitbit was at 40%. I was confused because that morning it was 100%. I just knew it would go dead. After hours of looking for the charger, I decided to order a new charger but in the meantime, the battery life was decreasing by the hour. I couldn't find a retailer online that had any so I went into Walmart. I was able to buy a replacement which is great because if not it would have been dead. Overall I love it but beware the battery life.

    Disappointing Accuracy and Frustrating Interface
  
",1.0,Roslyn M. Stendahl,"Reviewed in the United States September 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  It is frustrating and confusing to use this device. I would ride 17.5 miles on my bike in the morning and it would record 1/3 of the ride. I would on another day do the same ride and it would record the ride, but at the same time give me ""steps"" and also give me credit for going up ""stairs."" Since I was on a bike I don't know how either of those things were possible. (Though I did do 4 hill climbs which might have been ""counted"" as stairs?)The touch screen was frustrating to use. I would push and swipe forever to get to the exercise I wanted. Set up to start, but then have to repeat that all at the end when I'd already finished (but the clock was still running).  It also would not match the distances to my bike computer which matches my car distances and that's just confusing.While distances are inaccurate it does count steps so if you want to use it as a step counter on your walks that might be the one thing you can do with it.The sleep information seemed interesting and potentially useful but the timeline that shows your sleep is very small and not readable. When you click for info it just gives you the break down in general percentages, as opposed to being able to see what you were doing at each moment of the time line.Also the device sets the bar for ""reward"" very low—one exercise session got all the ""zone minutes"" suggested for the week????? And when I had a bad week of late nights not getting to bed until 1 a.m. I got a higher sleep score and was congratulated on establishing a healthy (????) bedtime.Also the type on all the screens is very small and difficult to read if you need reading glasses but don't always have them on; and the screen is always turning off just when you focus to read it.And the interface with the computer and the iPhone isn't great. I had to go onto the computer and search all around and look on the community boards for over an hour to NOT find an answer to how to add the elliptical counter on my watch. I finally found it buried in one of the menus because of a second trip to the community board and seeing something that gave me an idea of where I might look (though it was unrelated). Badly organized.I can't recommend this device to anyone, for anything. It will count steps and if that's what you want don't get this but get a pedometer. Everything else this device ""can do"" other devices can already do it (like apps for your phone, or a simply physical count of your heart beat).

  EDITED: DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT UNLESS YOU WANT TO LOSE IT WITHIN 15 DAYS! THE BAND IS A PIECE OF JUNK!!!  The purpose of a band is to keep it safely on your arm. My band is not on my arm and is now lost!Original review: This purchase replaces my Alta HR which lasted for three or more years. I do love this new Charge 4. It’s technically a wonderful piece of equipment. However, mechanically the basic wrist band is designed for low tech irritation. Every. Dang. Time. I attempt to remove it properly the band releases from the top of the device. What the heck? Today I was doing sit-ups and the band released from the exact same place. Imagine that frustration. I take it off the shower, to change clothes and I’m annoyed by the faulty disconnect.  How can such a great product be attached to such a piece of garbage band! Am I supposed to buy a second band after having this for less than a month?I AM GOING TO TRY TO BE COMPENSATED FOR MY LOST WATCH DUE TO THE DEFECTIVE BAND. I WILL POST MY RESULTS. IF I AM NOT TREATED FAIRLY, I’LL ALSO POST THE FITNESS TRACKER THAT BEST REPLACES THE FITBIT BAND.**The seller offered me a $15 credit towards a new band. My February 1st purchase is lost because of the original band. Why would I want another band? I have no tracker to use it with. I will never buy frothis seller & am questioning my trust in Amazon who allows such lousy customer service.Conclusion: This seller is subpar to say the least. Amazon excelled by resolving my issue with speed and fairness. Thank you Amazon and your great customer service. I had to spend a lot of time to resolve this.Moral of the story: The seller stinks. Amazon is trustworthy! Sainath was the outstanding employee at Amazon who took care of my problem. Thank you, Sainath!

  After a week of using this, Fitbits flagship tracker, I can definitely say I'm extremely disappointed with its performance. I purchased this specifically to map my routes via GPS and track my daily runs/walks. The GPS is constantly mis-mapping my route and also about 30% of the time it just randomly stops recording my exercise. About a quarter of the time the entire exercise stops recording, GPS, distance tracking, everything. The only part of this that seems to work with any consistency or accuracy is the daily pedometer, heart rate monitoring, and sleep monitoring. I got this model SPECIFICALLY because it has built-in GPS and is supposed to be able to record routes, and in that regard it has failed.

  GPS feature is virtually useless and I don’t use it. When I have it turned on it grossly underestimates distance. You cannot turn GPS on/off using mobile app. You must wait until you have access to a PC. Invest in another tracker if that feature is important as you will drain the battery quickly. You can tether to your phone, but that defeats the purpose.Others have complained about issues with setup - I had no problems, although it took a few days for the software update to take effect.It seems less sensitive than the Charge 2 that I had and liked. It frequently undercounts the number of steps or flights of stairs a lot more than the 2.I like that I can customize the display. I also like that I can read texts after they come in if I don’t glance at them right away. I prefer the previous method of calculating exercise (number of minutes vs. minutes in zone.)All in all it’s a good tracker for the money. I wish they had done more beta testing before releasing it. If you need a good GPS, I suggest you go for a bulkier watch that is designed for that purpose.

    Almost no features work correctly
  
",1.0,Eric,"Reviewed in the United States September 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've had the Fitbit Charge 4 for 3 months now. Almost nothing about it actually works.The good:* Sleep tracking seems to work decently. It rarely records me as awake when I'm asleep and vice versa.The bad:* Heart rate is off very often. At rest it will sometimes display twice my heart rate (e.g. it will show 140 bpm when my pulse is 70 as measured by hand or an arm cuff). While exercising it will sometimes show a value half my heart rate (might show 60 when my pulse is clearly 120 bmp), and sometimes it's off by some other factor, generally much higher than my actual pulse.** Heart rate is used to calculate calories burned and 'active zone minutes', so neither of those values are meaningful since they are based on bad data.* Steps. Not very accurate. I've tried walking 10 steps in a straight line and seeing how many steps are counted. Sometimes it counts 0, sometimes it counts more than 10. Sometimes after I stop and look at the steps, I'll watch the number continue to increment up to half a dozen additional steps while I stand motionless.* The android app is really bad. The 'home' screen that shows overviews of the main stats and the sub-screens for specific stats often disagree. Sometimes the home screen will show up to date data while the sub-screens have outdated data, but more often the subscreens have updated data that the home screen does not show. For example:** The 'steps' sub-screen usually shows hours where I hit the steps goal that are not shown in the home screen unless I kill and restart the app. The home screen might say I hit my goal for 1 hour while the steps sub-screen will say I hit it for 2 hours. Killing and restarting the app (which will quickly become habit if you buy one of these), often fixes that.** The heart rate sub-screen shows little sparklines, one for each day, but those plots don't actually update unless you go into the sub-sub-screen by tapping the sparkline. Once you've gone to the full screen plot for a specific day, the sparkline will show correctly in the heart rate sub-screen (but not always). Until I do that, I just see blank space where the heart rate plots should be.** The weight tracking feature is buggy and sometimes changes values I've entered. If I enter 157, it usually changes to 156.9 when I hit save. If I try entering it repeatedly, eventually it will keep the correct value.* Spam. I get spam friend requests weekly from the 'community' features of that app that I do not use. These cannot be disabled. I block and report the profiles, but it doesn't stop the next spam request that is sure to come along. How are they even finding me if I don't use any of those community features?Overall I am very disappointed and strongly recommend against buying one of these.

With my Fitbit Charge 2, I’d go days without having to worry about Re-charging my Charge 2. With the Charge 4 you HAVE check daily because I always find myself with only 11% or so amount left. EVERYTHING else is the same. Same limited exercises as favorites, same list of exercises to choose from (eg. here in Florida, many of us paddleboard, however you’d either have select “walking” or “kayaking” as an exercise of choice.)Overall, it’s a very average /adequate for exercise tracking, if you already own a Fitbit Charge 2 and it’s working, keep that one.  There is no real benefit or upgrade going to the Fitbit Charge 4.

  This item never gets past the icon with a scrolling web address for setup. I successfully set up the app, charged the fitbit, and got it connected but the display screen only showed the setup web address. SO I reversed all that and set it up on my computer. Same issue. Fitbit is fully charged, connected to an app, and everything should be kosher but it won't display anything. In researching solutions I see this is a very common problem with the new Charge 4. I tried many suggested work-arounds but with no success. Additionally many of the work-arounds recommend turning the item on and off but this fitbit won't respond to me holding the button. It gives intermittent vibrations but doesn't do anything. For two days after I charged it I could only get a black screen. It wouldn't turn on or scroll or anything, even when on the charger. Then, randomly after two days, it came on but still only showed the setup screen.I'm pretty good with technology and can figure it out but nothing I tried with this worked. Plus I grew resentful that it was even necessary for me to spend my time trying to find fixes, especially after spending this much money on a new product. Seems like there should have been attention paid to all these bugs before they released this version.

  Wore out my second Charge 3 so I thought I would upgrade. It made it easier that it was still compatible to my three bands which I had invested in a few of.I would not buy this color again. It didn't match as well my other bands, like my previous black or rose gold had.I don't use Spotify so that feature was a pass. And I'm not a runner so the built in GPS isn't much use for me.The bands don't seem to fit as snugly as my previous Charge 3's. Not sure if its the material of this purple one specifically but I scrapped it up real bad while rock climbing, hadn't have any issues with my others besides minor wear on my others.

    Fitness tracker, not a smart watch. Good buy!
  
",4.0,A Brown,"Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2021","









  
  
    
  I hate wearing any kind of watch to bed, so I honestly don't know about the sleep tracker. What I can tell you is that I love the Fitbit app, which is why I came back to it after several failed attempts with other trackers. The step and heart rate monitors seem to be accurate, and the screen is bright enough to see without squinting (one of the major flaws of other trackers I used). It's not a smart watch, so if you're buying a watch for all the bells and whistles, this isn't the one you want. Still, for my purposes, it's exactly what I wanted: an accurate tracker with an outstanding app. The band seems a little flimsy at the points of connection to the watch, but otherwise the band itself is sturdy. As far as the watch itself is concerned, I only wish that you could customize activities or that a larger variety of activities were available, but still for the amount I paid, I super happy with the purchase.

  This is very good tracker, for those who wanted a GPS on the tracker. Coming from a charge 2 it is a big upgrade. The battery life is good I got about 5 days. The bands are easy to remove and replace. The charge 3 has most of features this one has except the gps feature and it is cheaper. With the gps on during an activity drains the battery alot. Until a recent firmware update the display  would turn on at night when I am trying to sleep. But with this update you can turn the twist the wrist to display off when you sleep. The latest update gives the to use the built-in GPS or your phone's gps or none. Also you change the screen off time too.

  Thought this would be a good upgrade for my recently deceased charge 3.Good things:I loved the rosewood color. It paired relatively quickly and I tested all the features.Honest review:I discovered that the NFC for Fitbit pay wouldn't take all the cards I wanted to use so it was relatively useless. I also had to manually enter each card and wait to see what the app said. No thanks.  I discovered I still had to turn Spotify on on something ELSE..... BEFORE I could work with it on my wrist. No ability to cycle the music or pick anything,  so that feature wasn't useful either.I don't run, so GPS means little to me as well.  Clock faces.... meh. Those weren't going to change that much.So I returned it and got another charge 3. Im ok with no upgrade.Conclusion:  you might like it.  I turned out not to need the upgrades.  I'm sad tho,  I loved the rosewood color a whole lot.  But it's not worth it for just a color change.

  Simple put, skip buying this Fitbit and find a better product from another company. This device cannot connect to a computer via USB or bluetooth, nor any modern phone or mobile device. We tried connecting it to a range of devices and OS, nothing worked.  We tried a brand new iPhone 11, a  year one Samsung, a two year old Samsung and event an old Android phone. Plus we tried 2 Macbook Pros, a Macbook Air and an iPad. Not one would make a bluetooth connection.  So I cant rate the fitbit, but I can tell you that the product is flawed when it is this difficult to get it to work.  If this experience has taught me anything, Fitbit is not producing a quality product. Go buy something else, I will.

    Was worth the upgrade from Inspire HR!
  
",4.0,Chris C.,"Reviewed in the United States August 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  I loved how light and compact my old Inspire HR was, and it worked just fine for what it was. Battery life was great and using connected GPS with the app was very accurate. Except... when setup as using ""Running"" in app map was accurate, but no heart rate info. When using app to track run had non-stop issues with screen freezing and not able to pause/stop/finish run without rebooting phone... and the time it took to realize you had a problem, reboot, get back into the app and finally hit stop was all added up as the time kept going. Made it look like your last split was done crawling on your stomach. Now my runs are GPS tracked/started/finished right from Charge 4 and it works perfectly as long as you wipe the sweat off your fingertip! SO much nicer and cleaner than fumbling with the phone to hit the finish button. And didn't think the Sleep Tracking on the Charge 4 would be a big deal but wow it works, I honestly didn't fully realize how bad my sleep hygiene was until I saw how little actual sleep i was getting. Thanks Fitbit, gave me the push i needed to turn off the devices and get to bed on time! The Estimated O2 Variation could be a life saver if it gives you a heads-up that you might be developing Sleep Apnea (they aren't allowed to say that just yet) and was happy to see only little variation for myself. Very happy with the Charge 4 and am very glad I upgraded, the one elephant in the room of the way-too-short battery life on device GPS has been worked around on the latest firmware update allowing Connected GPS. So now the best of both worlds! However seems to be small bug somewhere as Connected GPS map is showing a straight 7 mile line instead of the real route but that's for another time...

  I loved Fitbit for years, passing on Garmin, Apple and Whoop devices. But I’ve had two (2!) faulty Charge 4 devices in a row, and I’m losing it. This device replaced a brand new one that didn’t register exercise. A couple months later—this one stopped too. I know my workouts, and I can almost tell my zones. This device (from Dec 2020!) barely registers any exercise. I’m not wearing this for show. I need the data. Get your act together, Fitbit.

  I got the Charge 4 as a replacement for my Flex which was slowly losing its ability to hold a charge. I'm not really interested in all the bells and whistles, but wanted something that would offer a watch face and count stairs because stair-climbing in my condo has become my winter-time activity. The first thing I noticed is that it doesn't track my steps accurately, so my step count went down slightly. I can live with that. But then I climbed 18 flights of stairs and it tracked 8. The next day I climbed no stairs and it tracked 4. I checked to see if this was a known problem, and apparently this has been an issue for quite some time. The final nail in the coffin for me was the morning it showed my resting heart rate at 102. I felt my pulse and it felt quite normal to me, not the galloping 102 it was registering. So I got out the BP cuff and it read my heart rate as 72, which is pretty normal for me.So if I can't rely on the accuracy of the step count or the flight count or even my heart rate, why would I think that any of the other data is reliable? The only thing that HAS worked reliably has been the clock. Given that, I'd rather just wear a wristwatch. I can find one of those that's a lot more stylish.The Charge 4 is going back and I won't be getting another.

  I wanted something that would both track my activity and give me phone alerts. While this touts that it does phone alerts, it absolutely does not. A quick Google search will reveal hundreds of forums of people who have the same problem of not being able to get the Charge 4 to give them phone alerts (calls, texts, emails, etc).There's no instruction book on how to use it, which is particularly annoying that they're too cool for a quick slip of paper that shows you what the different gestures do, instead directing the user to the app, which also contains no directions. To rectify this, a number of YouTube videos have been made by users to help other users. Why couldn't Fitbit just do this?It's fine for an activity tracker, but it does not deliver on what it promises in being more than that.

  After initially rating this product a one-star, I'm upgrading it to three stars.  Today, unlike initially, the exercise specifications seemed more realistic.  Doing essentially the same distance and terrain I used earlier, today, my average heart-rate was 115 BPM, and my maximum was 139, which seems reasonable for my age, 75.  Perhaps, the unit takes time to adjust to the user.  If this continues, I'll upgrade this to four stars.Initial review: I used this Fitbit Charge 4 to record a hike the day after I received it.  According to the Fitbit, my average heart rate over roughly an hour of hiking was 146 BPM, and my maximum heart rate was 187 BPM.  In two months, I'll be 75 years old.  According to the average of six heart rate estimating formulas, my maxim heart rate would be roughly 156 BPM, 30 below that on the Fitbit.  Something is very wrong with the Fitbit's heart rate mechanism.

  ***UPDATE 1-26-2021***I noticed shortly after writing this review that the wristbands do not attach snugly to the face of the watch.  My wife has a charge 3 and hers fit snugly on hers AND mine.  Mine are loose on hers.... something is wrong with the wristbands.  I also noticed there is an exceptionally long thread on Fitbit's community site regarding this exact issue, some like mine, and some worse.  Contacting FitBit, I got the response that many on that thread got: ""you have to ship in your device to us, then when we receive it, we'll ship you a replacement.""  Some users reported getting used devices in return.  That ends up being ~10 days turnaround time.  More serious though is that FitBit makes a crap-ton of money by convincing health providers to get employers to use these things, in order to save on health premiums.  They should be CROSS-SHIPPING, at a minimum, or shipping YOU a new device first, so that you don't have down time with no device.Also in the thread were comments that third-party wristbands were better, but no one specified an exact item that I could see, so I ordered at random -- we'll see.  It's not flat-out broken, but if it's loose, there's room for it to catch on a shirt or other object, and ripping it apart inadvertently.  This is not up to FitBit's own standards...Bad Form, Fitbit.***I have a USB Bluetooth adapter for my Windows 10 computer.  The Fitbit app refuses to acknowledge it exists and won't even attempt setup.My wife has a FitBit USB dongle from her old FitBit HR that she uses on her Windows 10 computer for her Charge 3 and it works fine.  using it in my computer lets the setup get a little further, but still errors out, suggesting I turn on Bluetooth.  my other Bluetooth enabled devices see it on, and it is enabled in Windows 10.  I should also point out that all the error messages are tailored for an Android device....so Windows is apparently an afterthought.I have a smartphone, but I don't like to drain my battery all day letting it check in repeatedly, when I can just do it at my leisure on my PC when it's charging.  I am really disappointed that I can't use my Windows PC or a generic Bluetooth adapter.Otherwise, it's a fitbit.  Got to have/use one to qualify for cheaper insurance at work.

  I really like the features this watch has to offer. I had a Charge 2 for 4 years, and finally had to part ways with it because I absolutely wore it out. I bought the Charge 4, and really loved all the new features and upgrades over the Charge 2. However, this is a poorly designed watch. I bought this watch in July 2020, and it broke on Christmas. The piece that snaps into the band has two screws that hold the ""catch/snap"" into the watch. Well, the piece with the screws sheared off inside the band. I flipped my wrist to look at the time, and the watch fell off--no pulling, snatching, etc. I've seen where several other people have had the same thing happen to them. I've worn my watch every day for the past 6 months, and I guess the constant turning to look at time just kept pulling on the plastic piece until it snapped. My charge 2 was all one piece and metal. The charge 4 actual watch is separate from the snap and is plastic. My daughter got a Charge 4 for Christmas (before I knew mine was going to break) so we'll wait and see what happens with hers. I would not encourage you to buy this watch though--I'm very disappointed in this watch design.  (I will update after speaking to Fitbit customer service.)

Thought everything was going smoothly as I tried to set up the app on my phone, ran into a slight problem when I tried to connect my device via Bluetooth but thought nothing of it, after all I just purchased it and maybe it needs time to charge before it comes on. Waited for it to charge, started this process within 30 minutes of it's delivery- 5 hours have passed. Pressed the button on the side while it was plugged, and it vibrated twice but the screen didn't come on. Attempted this again, tried to set up the device again via the app- didn't work. After awhile of pressing the button, the watch continued to vibrate even when I removed my finger- the screen is still blank. The watch I purchased was defective, I'm not sure if it's the seller's or manufacturer's fault but I'm highly disappointed. I don't want a refund, I want a working watch.On another note, the app is great.

  Wife and I bought matching fitbits at the same time - paired to the same model phones - and hiked the same trails at the same time.  Numbers for everything category very different.  Positively surprised this company only provided support thru twitter DM! (STOP RIGHT HERE:  Any technology company that makes support impossible and/or hard to access is peddling a known faulty product - take it from a long time tech support manager).  Once we did reach, of course they were absolutely no help whatsoever.  Canned BS responses that didn't match up to the circumstance or issues.  They absolutely refused to acknowledge and consider the fact of 2 devices paired to same model phones walking the same trail at the same time produced wildy different numbers.In the end, these are just estimating activity values based on suspected body movements (Yea! the device once told me I walked a quarter mile while eating a bowl of soup - the arm up an down movements mimic'd walking motion - and that's not the only thing producing bad data!!!!) There's absolutely no way to validate or prove the numbers - and that's how they like it.  And that's why they don't compare results.If you're looking for apps that don't work as advertised from companies that don't or can't support their products - you could probably get a better deal somewhere else.  If you're looking for an app to make data up and send you messages throughout the day, I can write you one at a fraction of the cost.  I'll also provide an email address you can use to send messages too!

  Replaced my first order, the screen would not turn on and all the Fitbit support could not get it to work. The replacement worked great until 2/9/21, when the display kept turning off and on and vibrating like crazy randomly. Eventually, the side button stopped responding. The face lights up to charge only, but the side button does not work. I can tell it is still tracking from the app. Support said it is faulty and to contact the seller to return. The return date ended 1/31/21 for me. I do not recommend Fitbit and am encouraging others to not purchase or risk wasting money like I did.

  Fitbit Charge 4 Fitness and Activity TrackerThe Good: Product works great, liked it for a while, kept me motivated until ""The Bad""; Fitbit refunded me so I'm happy.The Bad: The material it's made out of is total garbage. Unfortunately I was unaware that many people are allergic to the material that this tracker is made from. VERY BAD for a wearable. I can no longer wear this. ever. It give me a horrible rash. The first rash took about a month to appear. Now I can't even wear it for a day without getting the rash back. From what I have read it's unclear if the issue is the chemicals used for the rubber in the watch or if it's the nickel in the band but it is for many a unwearable wearable. My skin is not sensitive at all, but I wasted $160 on this. Great tech, horrible materials.

  This is my first health tracker. The device is pretty good. It needs to be charged about every three or four days so that is easily achieved without losing too much data. It charges quickly normally when I take a shower and that is good enough for days.I always had a problem wearing watches because of a rash developing under the band but I don't seem to have that problem with the Charge 4.The phone (Android) app is very good.I have had sleep problems for decades since I was a teenager. Not sleep apnea but just trouble getting a good night's sleep every night. This device does appear to accurately measure my sleep patterns based on how I feel the next day.My only major complaint is the Fitbit website and them trying to jam advertising into my face all the time. When I get automatically logged out every day so, I click the login link and login. It takes me right back to the homepage and I need to click the link for the dashboard which is buried on a drop down menu.My Ublock Origin stops about 9 or 10 tracking links every time I refresh the dashboard page.I don't know how long there was a big banner ad for the Charge 4 when they knew I had one already because it is configured into the application!!

  I've been looking forward to getting a fitbit, but I'm so disappointed in this. It's incredibly accurate. Outside, it misses anywhere between 15-25% of my steps. In my house it misses 25-40% of them. I've adjusted my stride length to try to help and it's still way off. On top of that, the heart rate is so far off as to be ridiculous while working out. I stopped several times to check my heart rate and while my heart rate will be between 150-170, the fitbit will mostly read between 110-115, occasionally jumping to 130 for a minute. But those higher intervals never show up in the app, so I don't get credit for them in my stats.The sleep tracking is great though. So it's got that going for it.

  I finally upgraded my fitness watch from a cheap branded one to a fitbit charge 4. I really like how accurate this watch is compared to the other one I have. Because it can do so many more things, it's taking me longer to learn how to use the different features, but I LOVE it so far!!The Fitbit App tracks so many things:-exercise (including walks, runs, swim, bike, treadmill, and outdoor workouts)- heart rate- sleep patterns- womens monthly (some manually, some it predicts)- calories burnedAnd manually, you can also track:- daily water intake- meals and carbsAlso, the watch has:- current temperature outside (based on location)- GPS tracking- spotify- timer-alarms (that actually wake you up!)up!)-Fitbit pay (so you dont need to haul your wallet around)Also, they have encouraging videos, breathing exercises and more that you can also use!I really like that this watch is water proof! I never take it off except to charge or change the bands to match my outfit! It came with 1 color of bands in 2 sizes, but I chose to buy a multi pack of other colorful bands!So far, I think this watch and the fitbit app deserve 5 star reviews!

  I liked the Fitbit for the purposes of tracking my fitness activity and sleep cycles. What I did not like was that the band attachment completely broke off on one side of the watch face. I’m not able to place another band because there is nothing to attach it to. I have only had it for 4 months. I took good care of it and was never rough with it. My husband had the same exact Fitbit and the same thing happened to his band after 6 months. Fitbit customer service told him that they could not replace it. Not buying it again.

  Do not buy this from Amazon. Buy from Fitbit. I purchased this product and it never turned on. I charged it and did everything possoble to turn it on and the screen was always black. I called Fitbit support which helped walk me through the process and the tech notified me that the product was broken. Instead of dealing with Amazon's impossible to navigate return policy, Fitbit offered me an easier return and replacement option. Amazon typically will buy damaged goods and sell them because they get a bulk deal. This isn't the first time I have ordered something through Amazon that arrived defected or broken. It is infuriating and wastes my time. Rule of thumb: try to get things from the company for large purchses or tech gadgets. This way you can ensure the product works properly and you can deal directly with the manufacturer instead of Amazon.

    Active Zone minutes ruined Fitbit for me. No real active minutes anywhere.
  
",1.0,Wadiak4,"Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  Want to know how long your workout took you? How long it took to run eight miles or hike five? Compete with yourself to see how quickly you can accomplish an activity? Basic info anyone who works out would want, right? There is no where on this app where you can see that info. They changed the active minutes to ""active zone"" minutes, a completely useless metric that tells you how many minutes fitbit thinks you deserve based on your heart rate. This change is so disruptive, counter intuitive, and plain ridiculous that I'm sending it back. I depend on real time active minutes, the amount of time I spend active in my 24 hour day, not some flaky hypothetical interpretation. I can get the intensity of my workout through heart rate and calories burned. I don't need inflated numbers. If you must coddle people, add the active zone feature somewhere, but don't replace the actual active minutes that let people know how much real time they've spent exercising. Shouldn't I be able to see that somewhere? What if I only have an hour and want to know which of my workouts I can do in that time? Guess I'm out of luck. Oh, and if you're very active, disable the gps feature or your battery won't make it through the day. Like I said, I'm sending this back, which is a shame because I've used Fitbit for years. It's insane that I can't see my real active minutes without adding up four categories of numbers. I'm looking at Garmins, which I didn't want to do, but here we are.

  I had this for under a week and though it did a great job of tracking sleep and steps - it was causing a very noticeable numbness in my arm. I shifted the watch on my wrist a few days ago and it sent a shock so powerful I almost passed out and had a seizure in public. i have had seizures before- but have not had one in over a year so it was alarming to be triggered so violently.Just wanted to write this here as I spent quite some time looking at reviews before I purchased this.Other cons: you cannot properly log exercise so it guestimates calories burned and over exaggerates potential calories burned whilst idle. So if you want a pedometer or sleep tracker - ok., but I would NOT recommend sleeping with this. The EMF waves are powerful and may impact you.

  If you are looking for a device to consistently let you down, to perform poorly, and to In accurately record your fitness activity, Fitbit is the device for you. I’ve had several fitbit Devices before this one and the Quality has lowered with each new device. Fitbit four claims to have an independent GPS however its spotty at best and you’ll still need to lean on your own phone GPS more often than not to get any kind of recordings. At times it will report an increase in the number of your steps beyond what is physically possible while at other times it will fail to record large sections of your exercise route. In two weeks it’s not needed to be reset several times.Consider a different fitness tracker!

Taps or pressing on the face did not progress or scroll to any other screen.  The button on the side would cycle the watch through an apparent reset with no visible results other than the useless setup screen (or worse, it would just go dark).Customer service, located in Columbia, answered my call quickly enough, and after a few iterations quickly decided to RMA the product.So kudos for off-shore support.

  This product does everything that it says it does and is very easy to use. The sleep tracking has been extremely beneficial, as have the customizable alarms that wake you up from light sleep so that it's easier to get up in the morning. The alarms are also nice because they work by vibrating, so there isn't a loud noise that would wake anyone you're living with. The heart rate monitor is fairly accurate, as is the pedometer and altimeter. The Active Zone tracking system was a great idea, and it makes it easy to tell how much quality exercise I'm getting in a week. The sedentary reminders are also really nice as someone who spends a lot of time at a desk. So far, everything has worked really well and with great accuracy, and it has helped me start getting in shape and start becoming healthier all-around using the breathing and mindfulness exercises. I would strongly recommend this watch to anyone who is looking to be healthier and doesn't know where to start, or who wants to track their current health, or who wants to track how they're responding to a new medication, etc. I love this watch, and it does a lot for the price. I almost bought the Inspire 2, but I'm glad I paid the extra money for all of the extra features on this watch.

In a normal day it says I did 1-2 flights of stairs when I’ve done and easy 10-15, also when I’m driving up the mountain from town it counts my altitude climb in my vehicle as doing stairs. Went driving other day and got home and said I did 38 flights of stairs when I didn’t even do 1. Sleep tracking is best part but with other simple inaccuracies with steps and stairs.

When it finally does start to work it just goes right to the peak it does not show up correct During exercise. It does keep track of my steps most of the time.

  To change something, you have to be able to measure it first. That's what the Charge 4 excels at. Be aware that a subscription to Fitbit Premium ($10/month) is pretty much required in order to unlock all of the advanced features you'll want to use. Overall, an outstanding investment that has me climbing more stairs every day.

  Just got my Fitbit Charge 4 2.5 months ago. Within a month it already started having glitches and problems. It periodically fails to connect to my phone, and therefore cannot sinc or update, so I have to go through the process of turning bluetooth off/on, restarting my phone, rebooting my fitbit, and then deleting and readding my Fitbit to bluetooth and to the fitbit app. It also has died multiple times during an hour long workout with approx. 50% battery left, or freezes up to the point I have to let the batter die then recharge it before I can use it again. I had a Fitbit Blaze before the Charge 4 that did similar things but after about a year or 2 of use. I'm convinced Fitbit puts defective products on the market. Unfortunately, I'm outside of the return period, so I'll be sending my Charge 4 back to be replaced. After 2 negative experiences with 2 different Fitbits, I'll be switching to Garmin in the future. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT AND CONSIDER A DIFFERENT BRAND OF FITNESS TRACKERS IN GENERAL.

  I bought this for my wife for her birthday, but after only a few weeks with it, it has been failing.Reminders, which was a favorite feature of hers, used to work but now have stopped.  She troubleshooted, went through and turned on all the location settings, rebooted the Fitbit multiple times, turned options on and off, still nothing.  The software seems glitchy.Text sync never worked, no matter how many times she’s tried to get it working.She says “It’s comfortable but makes me disappointed, because it promised so much”.And it also cost a lot too :(

    Other than step counting it is inaccurate
  
",1.0,Dj,"Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  Measures steps accurately.  Pulse monitor is very inaccurate.  When ride bike, swim, lift weights, etc the pulse monitor does not accurately measure, being much lower than my actual pulse as measured by two different other pulse monitors worn at same time.  Resting/sleeping pulse is also inconsistent on the Fitbit.  Try to wear as directed as to position.  Since pulse rate is tied to most features other than step counting, then this makes the watch not worth wearing,  certainly not worth the premium price.  Also, the app consistently Loses pairing with the watch so that I have Togo to setting, forget device and then pair it again.  I was excited about the potential features of this watch but really if you can’t trust the accuracy then why bother.  Needs improvement.

  Do your research before you buy it. You will find that so many people complaining about that gps takes time to connect or wont connect, or will loose connection during exercise. I have been a fitbit customer last few years. I was so excited to get built in gps option on charge 4. I do lots of biking, unfortunately, when you go biking on your charge 4, you wait 5 to 10 min for it to find gps signal and connect, and sometimes disconnects after connecting which means your exercise is not being tracked. I have latest updates, I have done hard reset, I have even chatted with a support but no solution.

  I am so disappointed in this product.  After three months of near constant wear, I went to take it off to charge and the casing disconnected from the band.  I contacted customer service and waited FOREVER. I left a message and waited well over two days.  I wanted to keep using the device so I glued it back together so I could continue to use it. They finally got back to me and said that because I glued it, the warranty was invalid.  I fully appreciate that modifying a working device invalidates a warranty but that’s not what happened. I’m super disappointed and will not repurchase a Fitbit.  There are enough competitors with better customer service and higher quality products.

  I had the charge 2 which I liked a lot. A few weeks ago it died. I decided to upgrade to the Charge 4 and I am very disappointed. There is no functionality to link your phone gps to the watch. What this means is that if you would like to do an all day adventure, like a long hike or kayak trip, you cannot track your effort. If you try to use your Charge 4's built-in gps, it will run out of batteries and you will be no longer tracking anything until you get it recharged. The Charge 2 had the functionality to link to your phone's gps allowing for tracking of long adventures. Why get rid of that function? Poor design and a poor purchase on my part.

    Hikers Beware!
  
",2.0,Blue Heron,"Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have recently upgraded from a Charge 2 to a Charge 4. However, I’m extremely disappointed with the Charge 4. I am an avid hiker that wishes to use this device for tracking lengthy day hikes. I also bicycle and, again, take long rides. It does not work well for these activities. There are two major issues of which I wish to warn buyers.1. GPS is spotty and drains the battery: I primarily upgraded to the charge 4 because I wanted the  onboard GPS. I have found the GPS to be very unreliable. It shuts off with the slightest tree cover. (My iPhone has no problem establishing GPS in the same conditions). Also, with the GPS running the battery life of the Charge 4 is drastically reduced. It will not last more than an hour or two - not nearly long enough for a lengthy hike or bike ride.The fitbit has “dynamic GPS” which allows the Charge 4 to use the phone and it’s bigger battery for GPS tracking instead of the onboard GPS. That seems like a solution to this problem however it is not because of problem 2.2. Bluetooth connection is unreliable: The Bluetooth connection between the device and the phone is horribly unreliable. Without a Bluetooth connection the dynamic GPS does not work and when the connection is dropped the activity is stopped. Unknown to the user the activity is no longer tracking.  I’m having to re-establish Bluetooth pairing several times a day. I’ve missed out on data for several hikes and bike rides. This is extremely frustrating. Re-establishing Bluetooth is a long battle (I’ve had it take up to 20 minutes) and I sometimes have to go to extreme measures to get the device to pair such as rebooting the Fitbit and/or phone. And even then, if it does Pair, it will not stay paired.I’ve communicated with Fitbit and they were not able to assist me. They offer suggestions such as turning Bluetooth on/off, or rebooting, reinstalling etc. These remedies will allow the Fitbit to establish a connection leading the service representative to believe they have fixed the problem. But bluetooth just goes out again later after I’ve ended the service call.A search of the Fitbit Community group shows that these are ongoing issues for which Fitbit, apparently, has no solution. I see similar posts here on Amazon. I also see reviews from people that like the Charge 4. Perhaps it depends on how one uses it.I’ve had reasonable results with the GPS for walks in urban settings. I do like the updated user interface, the sleep tracking, and that it is waterproof. But I warn day hikers/bikers to beware. Based on my experience the quality of the Charge 4 GPS, battery, and bluetooth are not adequate for these activities.

    This device is changing my life for the better
  
",5.0,Michael M. Gioan,"Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  The Charge 4 is an excellent motivator. In the beginning, I was expecting a good tracker for my sport activities and a way to monitor my sleep. The Charge 4 has delivered that, and much, much more, it has become an essential companion that is always there to nudge me to do better and provides amazing and detailed feedback on my progress at all levels.The cardiac activity tracker is simply amazing, the calorie counter very helpful to keep on top of a healthy diet, and the sleep analyzer provides great insight on quality of sleep, from which I have derived better sleep habits.Sport tracker is great, with multiple sports to choose from and automatic detection of activity. The GPS is a nice feature, but does consume quite a bit of battery life (about 15% per hour). Without using the GPS, I have been to up to 8 days between charges. I highly recommend using the ""Sleep mode"" at night to conserve battery life.The Charge 4 is light, unobtrusive, comfortable to wear, verifiably waterproof. Best of all, it does not burden you with all the technical complexity of what is does ""behind the scenes"", but instead presents you with simple and easy to understand reports (and great advice & recommendations too).I was never a big fan of ""meditation"", but I have to confess, I used the various sessions provided, and it does feel good. I am using the Premium feature (free for 3 months).I have not yet set up the touchless payment option, but will set it up, this sounds like a very attractive feature, especially if needing to purchase something when full wallet is left home.Gripes:1) The app is nice, but could be made a little more intuitive, it looks like it's been evolved over a long period of time by different teams with slightly different (well, quite different) ideas about user interface. Does the job, though if sometimes a little confusing.2) The Spotify feature is kinda useless, because it requires you to carry your phone with you, so it's just a Spotify remote control. I have removed it entirely to clean up the menus.3) It would be nice to be able to re-arrange the menus on the device.Despite a few glitches, I think Fitbit has a home run with this product.

I've checked the heart rate with my blood pressure monitor. Charge lasts a week, which is understandable given all the notifications it is capable of receiving/giving.

  I switched to the FitBit Charge 4 from a Xiaomi Mi Band 3 and I am not sure it is worth the money. I have tons of problems with this device.First of all FitBit's community moderators are incompetent. I submitted a feature request for this device and the request was flagged as already implemented and linked to a feature request for a DIFFERENT device. My followups just led to my request being linked to a different request that was ONCE AGAIN FOR A DIFFERENT DEVICE.My next complaint is the Spotify functionality. When working out in the gym it is great. You can choose what device to control, choose recent playlists, skip tracks, and like songs. With my old watch I really wanted to be able to like a song while I'm on a run while my phone was tucked away in my fanny pack. Welp, come to find out, I can't do it with this device either. Spotify and Workouts are separate standalone ""apps"" and they cannot run concurrently. So, if I want to map my run with my watch, I can't control Spotify at all.One of the worst parts of FitBit is the companion app. When it works, it is great, but it is full of bugs and often does not work. I will go to log water intake and it does not appear as having been logged for hours. I will log my food and it will add it to the wrong day.Fitbit's engineers have proven themselves to be horrible at their jobs. They are in the process of being acquired by Google, though, so I am going to hold out and hope things get better.

  I was excited to see the Fitbits have come down in price.  Unfortunately they have come way down in quality also. I dont usually leave product reviews, but I am so disappointed with this one, I felt I needed to.I ordered the Charge 4 in April, as soon as it came out, to replace my charge 2 that I had had for 2 years and was no longer tracking my heartrate.  I liked the design, LED light, and the way I could see my heartrate, steps and time all on the same screen.  I dont think it ever kept an accurate heart rate during workouts.  My heart rate was noticeably lower then the charge 2 when doing the same workout.I had the Charge 4 for 3 months and the plastic end on the device that holds the band on broke off.  All other Fitbits I have owned had metal tabs holding the band on, Charge 4 they are plastic.  Customer service did finally replace the Charge 4 and band after sending mine in and multiple emails.  Replacement took a little over a month.  It was the middle of September when I got my replacement.  After a week, it stopped tracking anything, but kept the time.  I had to do a factory reset on the Fitbit.  Once I got it going again, it never tracked my floors, but everything else worked so I kept it.  I have had the second one just 2 months, and the plastic tab on the end broke off the same way the first one did.  Please keep in mind, this is normal wear and tear, NOTHING out of the ordinary. I have an office job, so it is not like it is getting banged around.  VERY UNHAPPY.  I would give the Charge 4 negative stars if it was an option.  I hoped the first one breaking was a fluke, but it is clearly a design flaw.

  The new Charge 4 is in many ways an improvement over my previous Alta HR. One thing I notice is that I notice it; I catch the wristband on more things than in the past (like, right now, it's catching on the edge of my desk).HOWEVER: Losing the ability to set multiple alarms via the apps is a dev crime, meaning, don't developers wear the product? Now, it could be that developers don't *need* alarms, but many normal folks do. I use several for different days, etc. And rather than resetting them all the time, I could keep a bevy of bells in my FitBit app.NO MORE! The Charge HR allows for only 2 (TWO!) alarms, and they must be set--aka fiddled with endlessly--right on the watch with its wonky and at times oversensitive watch face.Not sure I'd trade it in for a Charge 3 (which I hear retains the in-app alarms), but I might... I just migh.

  Went from the fitbit versa to the charge 4 because I don't need all the extra stuff the versa offers. I mainly wanted the charge for activity tracking and it does a great job! It's a great size, comfy, easy to use, and doesn't get in the way as much as the versa did while I'm working out. I have not had any problems with being able to see the screen in the sun like some other reviewers had. I love my charge 4!

  I am big fan of Fitbit ever since they came our with the first Charge HR.  I prefer to wear a watch so I didn't want to have something that was too big (like the Firbit Versa).  The Charge HR is the perfect one for me as I want to keep track of my heartbeat and give me alerts when I get a text/call.  I had Charge HR 2 and was waiting until they came out with the pay option which  they now have!!The new pay option is really easy to use.  I will be using it more often now because of Corona virus pandemic.  I wanted to provide directions on how how use as it was not noted in the manual that came withe the Fitbit.1.  You add the credit cards on the app and need to set a pin (not all cards are accepted - there is a list on the Fitbit site of the cards that are accepted).2. When you want to pay, you have to hold the Fitbit button (on left side).3.  Then you need to enter the pin (just scroll up/down to find the number and tap the Fitbit to select a number).4.  After that you can tap the Fitbit until you find the card you want to use.5. Then bring your Fitbit near the pay station and it would accept within a few seconds.  I used at Market Basket a few times already and it works like a charge!The battery is about 6-7 days depending on your use (I have not use the GPS which I heard will drain the battery faster.  I wore it in the shower a couple of days to test if it was indeed waterproof and I can comfortable say that it is!  Overall I would definitely recommend this Fitbit Charge 4!

  So far so good. Great motivational tool and tracker. Didn't need all the bells and whistles of the Apple watch. I'm loving the sleep tracker because I'm discovering sleep patterns I didn't know existed. 4 stars because the Fitbit box itself arrived saturated in a soapy like liquid.

  I bought this specifically for sleeping and it has not tracked my sleep once on it's own. I have ZERO sleep data no matter what I try. I've read all of the help sections and have spoken to their customer service and still doesn't track sleep. The customer service is in another country and is very slow to troubleshoot and troubleshoots the same things over and over, even when I've told them I've tried certain things without luck. This was a waste of my money.

  Replaced a Charge 2 which I had used and abused.  Wish I had kept it because the Charge 4 seems to be a step backward.  Steps often don't count correctly.  Heart rate is often wrong (92 on the machines at the gym, but 74 on the Fitbit?).  Stairs--Our home office and our bedroom is on the second floor so we go up/down a lot.  Charge 4 under-counts those all the time.  And the Charge 4 does not accurately measure sleep--at least 50% of the time, it ""misses"" the first 2-3 hours of sleep.  And, now that Google owns Fitbit--really don't like that.  I am not impressed!

  Apparently Fitbit has been ACTIVELY REMOVING hardware features (including SpO2 and almost all of the rest of the sleep tracking features -- heck, the heart rate monitor SHUTS ITSELF OFF when you're asleep if you don't pay the monthly charge to keep it on!) so they no longer function without a $10/mo subscription.  This invalidates most of the good reviews from critics in my mind, since they never call out the subscription requirement.  No wonder Fitbit is losing market share (Google it) to all of their major competitors.App setup is super flaky as well, had to delete and repair because the watch refused to believe it had already been paired to the app.  The app has a pretty color scheme but very little useful info without the subscription fee.""Reflective"" band is only reflective in that it's not pitch black.  It's gray, so it apparently reflects _some_ light.  Not worth the extra $20 by any stretch though.Edit:  To add insult to injury, you can't unsubscribe from the spam they send you; the unsubscribe link is conveniently broken.

  Based on a lot of reviews, I really wanted to like this devise and gave it the benefit of the doubt for a while. Unfortunately, I found the Fitbit Charge 4 to have inconsistent performance. At times it was nearly impossible access the devise with a touch or a swipe. In the daylight, the screen was very difficult to read. Often, the FB seemed to get stuck on one ""window"" or another. Oddly the Do Not Disturb window was a common sticking point. Several ""reboots"" did not remedy anything. It's 2020, for the price, I expected a little more refinement. When it was working, it appeared to be fairly accurate with heart rate, sleep, etc., although at times it and/or GPS would confuse biking and walking. (I recently walked 10 miles in about 35 minutes. Quite the pace!) Syncing the device and the app is clunky.

It was easy to set up and seems to be pretty accurate.  I love the alarm and I think it's a less stressful way to wake up. The bonus is the sleep monitoring. I didn't think I would care about that, but it has been really interesting. I definitely see a difference in my energy level and focus on the days when I have had a better sleep score.  So now I'm starting to go to bed earlier and really pay attention to that and I feel better.  I do not use it to log my meals and water, but I love all of the  detailed information about my workouts. I wish I could add rowing to the list of exercises. Maybe you can, but I haven't figured that out yet. Battery lasts a week for me. I only turn gps on when I'm running.

IMPOSSIBLE to get it to charge.  The charger is also only about 1ft long so it's a pain to bend down to reach it, you then have to set it on the floor because cable is not long enough to reach up to set it on a table!  It's also impossible to get the charging prongs to line up with the charger.  It does NOT work with the  charger I purchased separately for my charge 3 even though it fits.The only reason I upgraded my charge3 was because my screen failed.  It has nothing over the charge3 except that it monitors during swimming.HATE the cheap PLASTIC watch band!  Rediculas for a $150 watch!  Not many nice bands available.

  After years and years of using FitBit, I've had it.  The trackers are very delicate (read:  break at the slightest tap against something solid), the Android apps work with a limited list of phones (and sometimes, not even then), problematic updates that cause more problems than they solved, and a very silent customer support.  I will not recommend any FitBit tracker to anybody.  This Charge 4 is the latest casualty, along with my backup Charge 3 and Inspire 2, none of which have workedl for 2 days due to the sadly flawed 3.37 update FB released this week.

  This is my third Fitbit Charge. It's very similar to previous versions. The major upgrade is the GPS tracking, so I don't have to take my phone with me but can still see a map of my route. I like that I can swim with it. I haven't yet, but I have showered with it with no problems and I know it waterproof to a reasonable depth. I think the Charge 3 was waterproof, but I know the Charge 2 was only water-resistant.The only issue I had was sleep tracking. I had to change the settings from the default to ""Sensitive"" otherwise it thinks I slept way more than I actually did. I go to bed an hour or two before I fall asleep and usually read, but on the default setting, it marks the reading time as sleep time even though my hands are often moving around. Once I changed the setting, the new tracking is much more accurate.Two things to clarify if you are considering this. The Spotify control feature on your watch just controls pausing, next song, previous song, shuffle, and what devices to play the music on if you have multiple Bluetooth devices linked to your phone. The watch itself cannot link to or store Spotify songs. You have to bring your phone on runs if you want to listen to Spotify.The second thing is if you are going to use Fitbit Pay, not all credit/debit cards will work. The primary credit card I use was not supported, but the second card I tried did work. If you only have one or two cards and you plan on using this feature, I would look at the list of supported banks on the Fitbit website before you buy. I only added this feature so I can buy water at convenience stores on long runs if I leave my phone at home.The app/dashboard is still great. Overall, I'm happy with it.

  This model of fitbit has a terrible battery life when the GPS is on. I went on a walk for an hour, and tried to turn off the workout, but the fitbit was non responsive. I noticed the battery was low, but I decided to look into it more when I returned home. It lasted only two hours for me even on a full charge. When I returned home and charged it fully, I saw that with GPS on the fitbit will only last for five hours. This kind of defeats the purpose of having a fitness tracker. But, fine, I decided I would not use the GPS function anymore. So I then go into setting to turn it off. Now the fitbit is stuck on a screen advising me to go to the fitbit website to know more about GPS. I don't want to know more about GPS, I want it off.

However, I think $150 is a bit steep for the quality and materials used.

    SO disappointed in this
  
",3.0,Diane M,"Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've had a charge2 for close to 4 years and it doesn't hold a charge as well as it used to.  I could go a whole week before charging that one and I've loved it.  So, bought this Charge 4 on sale - I can't tell you how disappointing this thing is.  I'm in my 60's but am relatively comfortable w/technology.  There is no way that this tracker needs all these features - it's ridiculous.  I don't need spotify on my wrist - emails - weather, etc.  And I certainly don't need to see my weight on there either - there's no way to take it off though.  There's a swipe up, a swipe down, a swipe left and a swipe right - on that little face of the watch. Really?  No thanks - this one is going back.  I'm going to look at a Garmin. Oh and by the way, the charge on this lasted 3 days - and I did not use the gps. Fitbit, if you're open to suggestions - why not market a scaled down model w/basic features - time, steps, heartrate, sleep.  Reduce the price accordingly and I think you'd get quite a few takers.  This one you can keep though....

    A great upgrade from a charge 2 but some things to note...
  
",5.0,Kat Moore,"Reviewed in the United States April 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  Got this after my charge 2 died and wow is it and upgrade I really love it so far! Fair warning though on some things I didn’t realize: you need Spotify premium to use any of the Spotify features at all which was kind of a bummer. And according to their website if you use the GPS feature the Fitbit battery only lasts 5 hours. So you have to be careful to turn GPS only on and off when you need it when you’re exercising and not just leave it on to auto recognize which is a little annoying but not a huge deal. Also a few features require that you allow them to run in the background for them to “work properly” I don’t like to have things do that to try and preserve my phone battery so I turned off those permissions but left the others on and so far I haven’t had any other problems because my Fitbit still syncs throughout the day and I think can still get data that way. My boyfriend loves the sleep mode feature that turns off notifications and screen wake so when I toss and turn at night I don’t accidentally blind him with my watch screen if it goes off.

The Charge 4 can not be setup with my android phone as it is running Android version 6 and can not be upgraded to minimum Android version 7.  With my windows 10 laptop and the Fitbit connect App, I have been able to run the setup utility to attach the Charge 4 to my Fitbit account, however I continue to have issues.  I still can not replace the message on the screen ""to Download the latest Fitbit app"" and have the time displayed .

  I love that it has more features than the Charge 3, and that's about the only good thing I can say about it.The battery didn't stay charged for 7 days. You go to look at your Fit Bit, and the battery is dead.  It doesn't matter if you just charged it  or not. I couldn't get the watch to connect to the App on my phone, so I basically had a expensive watch, that had ALOT of features that just didn't work. I don't wear it to track my fitness, it's just nice to be able to see what is going on in your life at times, so I was willing to deal with all of this.  Then, while doing some gardening, my Fit Bit, that I have had for 37 days, screen shatters...…  So, I contact Fit Bit, and I am basically told, they WON""T help me in any way. ( This response came from 2 different people at Fit Bit as soon as I said I purchased it from Amazon)  Then they say that I can buy a new Fit Bit from them.  I contacted them 2 days in a row, the first day was by computer chat, very rude, I had to beg for any info, to be told, sucks to be you, buy another one.  The second day was by phone, also VERY rude, same response. But, they would give me a 25% discount on a new Charge 4.  I asked them to email that info to me.  When I received the Email, not only did they tell me to buy another one, but they can't give me the 25% off.  I never should have upgraded, my Charge 3 had NO problems in the 3 years I wore it.  I even wore it to the beach, with no problems.  Save yourself some money, buy an off brand or 3. If they break, it's no big deal to get another one.

  This product worked as expected out the box. No problem syncing with my multiple year old LG V20 phone using the Fitbit app. There is no other fitness tracker on the planet that offers GPS tracking and touch free payment for this price point. The sleep tracking seems to work great so far, and I love being able to see my heart rate information on Strava. Battery life is not the best when using GPS (maybe 5 hours total with full charge,) however it is very good when used normally. If you're looking for a GPS tracker with longer battery life it will certainly be more bulky and you will probably not want to wear it all day (or night.)I would absolutely recommend this product to anyone looking for a full time fitness tracker with GPS capabilities.

    Upgrade from Charge 2 - Complete disappointment!
  
",2.0,Edward,"Reviewed in the United States January 22, 2021","









  
  
    
  I had been using the Charge 2 for about 4-5 years. Recently, I started having some issues with it. One, the battery drains much more quickly, which is to be expected. I went from having to charge it once a week to once every 24-36 hours. Two, the heart rate monitor just didn't seem to be working as well. There was a lag in the sensor which I compared with another heart rate monitor device. This is an important feature as I want to know what my heart rate is in real time while I'm doing intense cardio.I began looking for a replacement. I wasn't interested in apps that the more expensive smart watches offer (I don't need those as my phone is always in my pocket); I mostly just wanted more stats and analytics. I liked that the Charge 4 had an oxygen monitor. Additionally, I assumed after 4-5 years the heart rate monitor technology would have gotten at least a bit better and more precise, and hopefully fixed the lag. Also, I was tired of charging the Charge 2 every day, so I decided to upgrade to the Charge 4.Big Mistake.1. The heart rate monitor seems to have gotten WORSE! The heart rate lag while exercising was up to an entire minute. I know that sounds trivial, but if my other heart rate monitor can give me a real time reading, why can't Fitbit do the same? When I'm approaching peak mode this information is vital! Knowing how far I can safely push myself is important, and was the biggest reason I purchased this item. It failed.2. The SpO2 feature is junk. First, it only monitors your oxygen in your sleep, so basically you only need to see that result once. Two, this feature doesn't give you actual values, just a tiny non-clickable graph which is the same every night. Complete disappointment.3. The battery, surprisingly, started draining VERY quickly. While I liked being able to see the battery level on the watch, I couldn't believe how often I would get low battery warnings during my exercises. Many times I would leave the home for a 60-90 minute walk or run with the battery at 40-50% charged. I got this so I wouldn't have to charge the watch every day, but I found myself having to do it every day or every other day. Another fail.4. Comfort wise, the Charge 4 is bulkier and a bit less comfortable.Three features on the Charge 4 I liked:1. The precise GPS tracking is a nice feature. With the Charge 2 I would often get some missing stretches of a run. The Charge 4 always gave a very accurate location path.2. I liked being able to see text messages on the watch, but again, it's hardly useful when my phone is always right there.3. I liked the oxygen monitor, well, for that first night. It was nice seeing that I didn't have any issues like sleep apnea or COPD, but again, this isn't something that's going to rapidly change overnight and is therefore mostly useless.4. I liked being able to see my resting heart rate on my watch. This was a nice feature, but again, not worth the money.5. The Charge 4 app is a little bit shiner and sleeker, but the information is all mostly the same.In conclusion, the Charge 2 is actually better than the Charge 4 in terms of heart rate monitoring. The little upgrades are kind of neat, but they aren't very useful and definitely aren't worth the money. Hopefully, Fitbit fixes these issues and has a bit more to offer on the next version.

  I've worn a Fitbit on my wrist for several years now.  When my Charge 3 (which I loved) failed, I upgraded to the Charge 4.  BIG MISTAKE!  The Fitbit functions fine - just like my Charge 3.  However If you allow GPS, it must be charged multiple times daily.  Even with GPS turned off in every exercise, It needs to be recharged every day.  I've scoured the internet for fixes, downloaded the update, reset the device, asked for help on the forums.....but to no avail.  Don't buy this unless you want to recharge it once a day.  And let's face it a GPS feature that drains the battery in a few hours is worthless for hiking or biking.  I'll use my trusty 10 year old Garmin for that.  Quite disappointing Fitbit.

    Syncs better and more accurate than Fitbit Inspire HR
  
",5.0,timbernim,"Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  I upgraded to the Charge 4 after using the Inspire HR for a year. Overall I liked in inspire HR but as I used it more and more I noticed problems that I don't have with the Charge 4. Let's start by saying I workout 4-5 days a week, usually weights, spin and the occasional general cardio workout, along with this I bike to and from work 5 days a week. For me the heart rate monitor helps figure out where I'm at in my workout and how much more I should push, with the inspire HR, during heavy workout days I'd find when i glanced at it, it would fail to read from time to time, I haven't had this problem since my Charge 4 arrived. The built in gps in the Charge 4 comes in handy but it does drain the battery a bit; On a day when I have a workout, gps turned on for an hour total (to and from work) and throughout the workday----that's about a 16-17 hour day--- it gets down to about 74% battery. It syncs better to the app than the Inspire HR, sometimes I'd have to refresh a half dozen times for the app to find the Inspire but most of the time the Charge 4 syncs immediately or at least after only one refresh. There's additions to the app with the charge 4 including zone minutes, elevation, and a few more badges you can gain. I suppose if you're more athletic and do more outdoor activities the Charge 4's built in gps might be more of a problem than a good thing but for the intermediate fitness person, it's a step up from the Inspire HR.

    Just another substandard product from Fitbit
  
",1.0,Zapato,"Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I upgraded from the Fitbit charge 2 to the charge 4 hoping for better accuracy and reliability.  I have to say that after about six weeks of use, I've been disappointed.  While the step counting and floor counting got a little better, the  heart rate monitor is still suspect.  The problem with the heart rate might be that I cannot get the Fitbit device to stay two finger widths above my wrist bone without stapling it in place or using duct tape to hold it there.  Does anyone else have this problem?  The most annoying issue I have with this model of Fitbit is that the GPS tracking keeps dropping off in the middle of a run or walk.  It simply loses the GPS signal and stops tracking your progress.  As a result, it does not map your route, gives inaccurate time, pace and distance information and basically makes the GPS feature worthless.  And now the app is about as annoying as the tracker.Shortly after setting up my Fitbit tracker the company pushed a software upgrade to the app that works with it.  Now, every time I open the app I get a prompt asking me to turn on location services.  Well, I had the app set to allow location access only when using, but apparently that's not good enough.  Fitbit wants to track my every movement!  I did allow full access allowed for a short time and after a few days my iPhone prompted me with a message stating that Fitbit was gathering access on where I went even if I wasn't using the app.  Seems like privacy is a foreign concept to this company.Bottom line, find something else that works and won't invade your privacy!

It has helped with realize I had horrible sleep habits (ie: none), gotten me to do extra house chores (that I usually ignore as long as possible) just to get ""credit"" for the extra steps or active minutes. The workout tracking had been good to also keep me motivated. I share a screenshot of it with my family almost every week and that keeps me honest to actually worki out. Overall this seems to have been what I needed to get going with life changes instead of whining about my size. Now I feel better both mentally and physically, and have started to lose a little weight. Overall I recommend this to anyone who is stuck in that rut I was.

  As the novelty of the tracker gimmicks fade over time, you will come to hate this product, passing thru indifference, to annoyance, to levels of white hot rage seen only in the Oval Office since Arizona was called by Fox News.You’ll come to realize your life is no better for knowing you spent 55 mins in REM sleep instead of 50, you’ll stop caring about the sleep monitoring. But you’ll stop wearing it at night entirely when your partner complains to you that’s the 3rd night in a row that the green sensor light woke her up when you shifted in bed, and threatens separate bedrooms. That sensor light at the back may seem innocent enough in the daytime, but at night it’s strong enough to summon Batman. And apparently nobody thought to dim it when the tracker figures out you are asleep.You’ll discover that connecting to GPS can take 3 seconds, 3 minutes or 3 hours, randomly, even in areas of strong signal coverage. You’ll have to decide whether to stand by your bike watching that jerky triangle symbol, or just take off and have the thing act as a glorified stopwatch. Somewhere, in the continental USA, there’s a skeleton lying next to a bike, all that remains of a Fitbit wearer who decided to wait for a GPS connection. Eventually you’ll come to the realization that tracking your exercise geographically isn’t a right, it’s a privilege that Fitbit, in its munificence, bestows on you occasionally, perhaps on Hindu Holy Days.Don’t expect to be able to see the display outside, in natural light. You can’t. The pale, greyish text on a black background is designed to cause eyestrain. My exercise mode of choice is cycling. And I’ve concluded that either the Fitbit engineers don’t actual cycle at all, or they all have recessed vole genes and cycle at midnight on cloudy days during power outages. It’s one or the other.And even if you can see it, in a dark alley, the thing flashes constantly between Cardio and Fat Burn or congratulates you on 300 steps an hour or doing a washing load or baking a cake, basically anything it can think of to stop you seeing useful information at the flick of a wrist, like how far or how long you’ve been exercising.And your tracker wants to thwart you from turning GPS off afterwards, there’s no option to keep it on only for the duration of the exercise, you’ll have to swipe left, right, up and down 15 times to find it again afterwards, or more likely, you’ll forget entirely and it will need recharging within the hour again. BTW, don’t even think about exercising with anything less that 35% charge. You’ll see the drained battery symbol in no time.Fitbit is about to be acquired by Google. And Google, like V’Ger in Star Trek: The Motion Picture, exist to Know All That Is Knowable. Now I’m not saying NASA needs to shoot Google executives into Deep Space, but it would spare us having to watch them lie to House and Senate committees every three months.Perhaps you can reconcile yourself not to mind that Google are collecting your biometric data and tracking your every waking movement so they can show you ads for Preparation H or congratulate you on your pregnancy before you are even aware you are pregnant (this is not a Joke, this is a Thing – read the NYT article about Target Stores and data mining). But we are surely only 3 firmware updates from the tracker playing 6 second commercials for Burger King every 2 minutes, just like the abomination YouTube has become.

  So this is my 3rd smart wearable device I have owned. I have had the original Moto 360 and I currently have the very old (in electronic years) Huawei watch. I will start off by saying that this Fitbit Charge 4 is way more comfortable than the previous two device. Once on your wrist you will forget that it is there except when it buzzes on your wrist for notifications. Speaking of notifications, they work very nicely without being over bearing. You can choose and select from which apps you want to get notifications on, for example all I care about is notifications from WhatsApp, Messenger and my Emails so that is all I have it set to. You also will get notifications about you activities which you can also change if you feel your getting too many. I left all settings at their defaults and I do not find I get to many notifications. I walk 5 days a weeks and workout 3 days a week and the Charge 4 automatically tracks my walks perfectly. As for my workouts it doesn't seem to know when I am doing pushups or pullups and of course it will not pick up the fact I am doing planks but that is ok as I doubt I am burning a lot of calories from my 3 day a week workouts as it is more for muscle toning and trying to keep a flat stomach in my old age.Sleep tracking on the Charge 4 is very nice!  I have had a sleep study done about 7 years ago and they said I stopped breathing 4 times during the night of the test but that it was not severe enough to warrant a CPAP. This tracker has a SP02 sensor so in the morning I can check to see how many times my blood oxygen dropped low during the night and so far it has only been a couple times over the 17 days since it has started tracking my sleep. So that makes me feel a bit better knowing I really do not have a Sleep Apnea problem. It would be nice if Charge 4 gave you more detailed blood oxygen information, like percentages during the night, but that might something to due with the fact that this is not a medical grade device and they do not want people thinking that or they don't want to have to go through the process of getting certification for it which would cost a lot and effect the cost of the device. Also it does not have OnDemand for SP02 reading, it only checks it at night. It would be nice if they added OnDemand SP02 checking. From reading over on the Fitbit forums it might be added in the future so that would be a big plus, especially for runners.The Charge has 24/7 heart rate monitoring and they use this along with movements to track your sleep and give you a really detailed Sleep Score. It will show you REM, Light, Deep sleep and time awake during the night. From what I can tell it is mostly accurate as it seems to match up perfectly to when I have gotten up to go to the bathroom or let the cat in or out etc. and the REM seems to match up to when I was dreaming the times that I woke from my dreams for what ever reason and checked the time. If I ever do another sleep study it would be neat to check the results verses the Charge 4 but I feel it gives you a very good idea of how your nights sleep was. When my score is high like in the 80s I feel refreshed in the morning but when it was low a few times (73) I felt tired and needed a long nap in the afternoon to recharge. Speaking of naps, it will track your nap so long as it is over 1 hours but will not give you any detailed info about your nap like it does for night time sleeping.Functionality wise, I like how the Charge 4 wakes when you lift you arm. My Huawei watch is hit and miss when I raise my arm but the Charge 4 seems to be about 95% of the time. The touch to wake screen I wish was a bit more sensitive, it works fine after it has been woken from lift to wake but if the Charge 4 has been a sleep for a while and you try and tap to wake I find I have to tap it a few times. This effect me when I am using the Stop Watch feature to time my planks, I can not lift my arm to wake it during planks and trying to tap it to wake it to see if I have hit my time on the Stop Watch can be a pain.Scrolling on the watch is smooth and fast but they need to fix the firmware so that once you leave the main menu, say to go into settings, you can not swipe right to go back, you are forces to press the haptic button to go back which is a pain. I started a Feature Suggestion to get it added over on the Fitbit forum so feel free to up vote it.The display is crisp and bright and easy to read even outside. With my Huawei watch I could not see anything on the screen while outside. The font is large enough that I can see most of the information without my glasses on so that is really nice as I only put them on for reading and of course take them off when I am exercising.About the only I miss from my Huawei watch is music control. You should be able to pause / play and skip tracks of whatever app is playing music on your phone. Not sure why they didn't add this in yet as the Charge 4 is always connected to the phone via Bluetooth so it should be able to do it with a simple firmware update. Even cheap bands out there have this simple feature.The other feature missing but I do not miss is a mic for Google Voice command and a speaker to take calls on your wrist. While it is cool to do this to show off who really want to talk to your wrist to ask Google something or worse to try and have a conversation with someone that everyone around you would be able to listen in on?As far as battery life, they claim 7 days and I am seeing that. I think even 8 days are possible. There is an option to have the screen stay on longer when it wakes but that seems to take a day off the battery life. There is also a Feature Suggestion to add a Always On Display AOD over on the Fitbit forum to the Charge 4 but I think the battery would take too much of a hit if they added it. I think Fitbit did a good job with features and battery life with the Charge 4 as it stands now. Maybe in the Charge 5 with a larger capacity battery they could then add a AOD and maybe a color display that is even bigger but with the current battery technology I think they did a good job with the Charge 4. I like only having to charge mine once a week. Note: I have my Charge 4 set to GPS Mode Dynamic as I have my phone with me when I take my walks. If you leave your phone at home the Charge 4 will automatically use its built in GPS which will drain your battery faster. So keep that in mind if you like to take your walks and runs without taking your phone. One week soon I will try a complete week without taking my phone with me and will update this review with how long the battery lasts so you can get an idea.The other thing I  really like about the Charge 4 over others out there (I was looking at the Garmin Vivoactive 4) is that the band is changeable! As you can see in my photos I have 3 different bands, two came with the Fitbit Charge 4 Special Edition and I purchased the Fitlink Stainless to give it a ""Classy"" look.When you get the Charge 4 it will be on an older version of firmware, which just means it needs to be updated, you can not force it to update and so you have to wait for it to update. Mine took 20 hours to finally say there was an update available. I have read it can take two days. So be patient. I know that this sucks but I think they do it that way as to not drain the battery on the Charge 4. I kept the Fitbit app open and manual synced the Charge 4  (in the app) as often as could while on the charger to get it to show the ""Update Available"" in the app on the phone, so if you are impatient like I am you could give it a try.Well that about wraps up my review of the Fitbit Charge 4 SE. I hope this review helps others out there. I will update the review as I use the Charge 4 more and will adjust the ratings up or down as needed.Note: I was not given this product to evaluate. I paid for it with my own money so my review is not bias in anyway.Updated March 9th 2021, I can see why everyone is leaving Fitbit and heading to anyone else but Fitbit... they have very bad tech support, firmware updates take forever to roll out, and to this date they have not turned on features that they advertise on their very own website. Shame really as I really like the Charge 4 but without support and timely updates to be it is not much use.

  Overall it's a great little tracker. Sleep, step, and heart rate tracking is fairly accurate for the everyday person. Silent alarms that wake you in your light sleep cycle are very convient. Timely text and phonecall notifications are great and the simple replies are very convient. Using the GPS to track your runs/walks DRAINS the battery so I don't suggest it unless you start your run at full power and end at the charging station. The Spotify control is nifty but only works when you're not tracking an exercise. NOT ALL CREDIT AND DEBIT CARDS ARE SUPPORTED FOR FITBIT PAY!!!! Check your cards compatiblity before purchasing. More options could be done with the main screen face such as showing weather, unread notifications, or upcoming events.

    Too many annoying issues -- Charge 3 would have been a better choice
  
",2.0,Jz,"Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  Was looking forward to my first fitness tracker and the ability to track steps, heart rate and sleep. The Charge 4 is generally OK doing these things but with a lot frustrating issues.First, it does not really track steps -- it racks arm movements. So if you move your arms a lot when talking or pet a cat, you get step credit. But if you keep your hands on the grip on a treadmill, elliptical or exercise bike, you get little or no credit for movement. The Health app on my iPhone does a better job in my pocket.Heart rate tracking can also be a problem. I noticed that the Charge 4 showed a heart rate 60bpm LESS than that on my exercise bike. Manually taking my pulse confirmed that the bike was correct. It took the Fitbit almost 20 minutes to be accurate.Using the ""Exercise"" feature on the Charge 4 seems to reduce this problem but there is still a lag. Plus, starting this feature requires you to press the side button, swipe to exercise mode, scroll to the exercise type, tap ""Start"", and tap ""Let's go"" to begin tracking. That's at least one more step than necessary (Start should mean start) and sometimes you miss that last step and nothing is tracked. Stopping is also a little more complicated than necessary.I thought the GPS function would be nice to track all day hikes or moving around a city. The map showing your movements is cool. Unfortunately, using GPS consumes the battery at the rate of about 30% per hour so all-daytracking is not possible.I don't use Spotify but in poking around trying to resolve some of these other issues I found out that the feature on the Charge 4 is only a controller and not a music player. So anyone thinking of using it for music must still carry their phone or other device.Finally, the Fitbit app is both great and THE most frustrating aspect of using this thing. Graphics and information are really nice. BUT, it is very glitchy. Took two chats with support to get it to pair and work properly with my iPhone and iPad. Then, after a firmware update, the Charge 4 was no longer paired with my phone. In fact, the phone could not even see the Fitbit in the Bluetooth menu. It still could be synced on my iPad, so OK.After a second firmware update a few weeks later, my phone asked if I wanted to pair with the Fitbit, which i did. But then it didnt work with the iPad. and the next day it lost the pairing with the phone. Every time I paired it again, it eventually lost the pairing until I restarted the Fitbit. Now it stays paired with the iPad (so far) but is once again invisible to my phone. So we are back where we started after a frustrating few days.I considered sending it back and would have if this last App episode occurred before that window closed. Overall, there are things I really like about the Charge 4 and things I really detest about it. If I had to do it over again, I would have sacrificed the GPS and Spotify -- which are pretty much useless to me anyway -- and gotten the Charge 3. It costs less and might even be less glitchy since its been around awhile.

  I've owned the Fitbit for several months now. I love my Fitbit. Unfortunately, I am not allowed to wear it during my work for security reasons. However, I primarily use it for keeping track of my after work exercise and heart rate monitor. The heart rate is as accurate as my chest strap on. As for as sleep monitoring I don't have anything to compare it to for accuracy. But it does record an average of 80 nearly ever night. I purchased a band that would keep the watch adjusted perfectly to my wrist for optimum performance because the factory band was either too loose to record HR or too tight for comfort. I do not use the text option so I can not rate.

Not one worked.  My phone is a Google, runs the latest reference Android.I could spend hours working this, but it is a better use of time to work more hours for pay, and buy a real solution.Spend the money, buy an ecosystem: Samsung phone and watch, Apple phone and watch.Wait for the Google version.Or save money and buy a cheaper, yet adequate, clone -- you will have a better experience.So disappoint.

  The readings on this are just too inaccurate to be considered a reliable fitness tracker. Everything is very general readings. Like the step counter is far off!! (maybe its accurate for someone who has a shorter stride). I have tracked my walks with a GPS and the Fitbit 4 is far from close. I would say daily it tracks about 70% accurate to what i actually walk. So if you want to rely on this for accuracy I highly recommend buying a different brand.

",5.0,Jack K,"Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2021","









  
  
    
  I upgraded from a FitBit Inspire 2 to the Charge 4 so I could use the builtin GPS function and not have to carry my phone every time I want to take a walk.  So far I'm very happy with it and all my actual exercises seem to be tracked accurately.Every once in a while the pulse monitor will display double what my actual pulse is.  For instance I was watching TV one morning and I felt a buzz on my wrist from the Charge 4.  I glanced at it and it showed my heart rate at 128 bpm and that I was in the cardio zone.  I took my pulse manually with my fingers and a clock and it was actually 64 bpm.  I moved the tracker higher and lower on my wrist and even put it on the bottom side but it stayed double my actual pulse for several minutes.  Then it went back to normal.  Sometimes it will do it when I'm at work and other times when I'm driving.  It's only once a week at the most and only for maybe 5 or 6 minutes at a time.  I took one star off the accuracy for that since it screws up my active minutes and calories burned in the app.Other than the pulse thing, the GPS and step counter are very accurate when I compared them to actually counting my steps while doing laps on a high school running track.The battery charge lasts more than 4 days (I charge it on Mondays and Fridays when I first get to work) and it's at about 35-40% on Fridays. I could probably get another day out of it but I'm sitting at my desk doing nothing so it's a good time to charge it.  It charges up in around an hour.My wife now has my Inspire 2 and it works well for her.  She does most of her cardio workouts on an elliptical machine so doesn't need a built in GPS function.The FitBit Charge 4 is a good little unit and I'm happy with my purchase.

  I love pretty much everything about my new Charge 4 Fitbit - except for the fact that I was only able to charge it twice. Amazon doesn't exactly have the most user friendly customer service - I really didn't want to return the Fitbit, just see if I could get a replacement charger, especially when 'exchange/replace' is for anything EXCEPT what you originally purchased. So, if you have the same issues with an original charger that doesn't work, the NANW Charger Cable Compatible with Fitbit Charge 4 works beautifully. It connects up to my fitbit better than the original and charges MUCH faster! And it stays charged longer. I charged my very dead Fitbit when the NANW Charger arrived Dec. 8.

  This is my first Fitbit and I love it, I have had it for about 3 months now. The only draw back is I keep having to restart it or reset heart rate as it stops reading frequently when exercising. I have large wrists so the original band does not work out to well so I had to get an adjustable elastic band that works pretty good most of the time but it’s already time for a new band. The best part of this product is being able to see how many calories you burn vs what you actually take in. When I got this band I was 315 and now I’m down to 290. It helps me stay motivated to eat better and exercise more even though I have a sedentary job. Very happy with the progress. I only wish Fitbit made better bands for guys with large wrists.

I like to hike 12+ miles and bike 30+ miles when I do adventure out. I can't even use the GPS to track an entire trip without my Charge4 dying. All other features are good .

  Have had two Fitbit Charge 2 devices.  Both were reliable, worked fine.  Screen cracked so I thought I'd upgrade to a Charge 4 based on the great reviews.  It is an absolute piece of crap.  It is cumbersome on the wrist and the device itself is not nearly as easy to use and responsive.  Sleep tracking has me in deep sleep when I am up and walking around, and in terms of tracking exercise, I turned it on for a stationary bike workout, and now it literally WILL NOT STOP.  I took the device off an hour ago, and have pushed every button, scrolled every scroll, and it will not turn off.  It's been off my wrist for 30 minutes, and I guess I can still work out with no pulse at all.  DO NOT BUY THIS.

  Fitbit pay is poorly implemented as it is first thing on the 'hold side button' meu - which I use often so I don't want to go through fitbit pay screen and I don't want pay on; I want to turn on pay function when I need it and then turn it off. The pay option should be the second left swipe after holding side button at which point you should be able to use PIN or not. The 2n main functionality problem I have is that you can't adjust font so I can't see my steps count without glasses and there is really one one face that has what I want. They have not fixed this in years probably focusing on their bigger ticket items? I don't know.. If another company had a similar style that looked as good I would probably switch. Too bad otherwise I like almost everything else but these are key features that are just so poorly implemented ...

  I would have given it 5 stars if the app shared data with the Apple Health App on the iPhone and iPad.  I tried a much cheaper fitness tracker and the app for that one shared with the Apple Health App.  Why doesn't the fitbit app?  The tracker seems pretty accurate for what I use it for - primarily heart beat and sleep tracking.  The heart beat monitor seems very accurate compared to other monitors I have.  While I haven't had this fitbit long, what little sleep data I've collected appears to underestimate the total length of sleep I'm getting.  That said the analysis of light, deep, and REM sleep seems far more accurate than the cheap Lintelek tracker I tried.  The Lintelek tracker was garbage that faked heartbeat data during periods I wasn't even wearing the thing.  I wish the fitbit came with better instructions in the package.  I had to go looking for instructions - turns out there is a pretty detailed manual in the phone app.  Glad I found that because for all the various exercise activities the fitbit claims to track, before you get into deeper settings, the device only offers to track a few.  Was also surprised that the tracker does not track rowing.  Rowing machines are pretty common in gyms and for home fitness equipment.  Instead, I have to select a general fitness routine, and for the 5.5 miles I row, the fitbit gives me credit for about 1.17 miles traveled.  Overall I'm happy with it and the app, but there is still room for improvement.

This is a bulkier than my Flex 2 but has a readable face.  It's not feminine at all but I purchased a thinner 'girlie' wrist band.

",3.0,D,"Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2021","









  
  
    
  For a basic fitness tracker this does its job. Great for tracking heart rate and steps (with some caveats).Pros- Good sleep metrics- Good heart metrics- Good options for setting various personal goals- Decent tracker for calories burned- Many exercises available- App has good graphs for tracking stuff over weeks, months, or even years- GPS provides good metrics (when it manages to work)Cons- App is slow to sync with watch. Often takes a minute or two, and sometimes multiple tries.- GPS rarely works. I run a couple of times a week under open sky, it still fails to connect most of the time, probably less than 1 in 4 attempts. This is probably the biggest issue with this watch.- Watch face is too dim under sunlight. None of the face styles offer pure white while including the health metrics. Some things are always gray colored, which is too dim, and you have to cup your hand over the watch to read them.  Run timer is also unreadable under sunlight, so it's nearly impossible to check your time while you're running- Screen will occasionally freeze. Only way to fix seems to be connecting it to the power cord.- Sticks out from your wrist more than a regular watch, so it's easy to catch on edges.- When tracking steps, it counts extra arm movements as steps (such as washing dishes or other chores) so unless you purely walking/running it's not that accurate over the course of the day.- No swimming option for open water- Water/sweat will sometimes interfere with heart rate monitoring

  It's not much different from the one my 9-year-old had and doesn't even wear it, and this one feels the same to me, but I got her a few nice (20 bucks?) straps that match the clock piece, but it does have way more options and features. So on that note it's not as expensive as an Apple Watch, which I have, gen 4, and its night and day, to ME, not her, she loves it, she loves that it's small, and the straps I got are jewelry looking, so it looks like a bangle bracelet/smartwatch.For 145 its got all the tech the apple watch has except the ECG and color screen and basically its a watchphone, I use my right Air Pod to take a call, I mean its nowhere near as ""cool as"" the Apple watch is, but if she's not looking for another thing to break, which you can easily break an apple watch, then this is it, its got it all if she's looking for real health info, the app is really nice and shows a lot and is useful, unlike the apple watch health app, kinda sucks. So that's it, try to get a different band if that your taste, the stock ones are just like the apple watch ones, I understand its better for water and intense workouts, I guess?

  Let me start off by saying I have never felt compelled to write a review before, but this product warrants one. I bought this tracker to help motivate me and stay accountable for my fitness goals. The heart monitor and the app were also big factors that helped me decide on this particular model. What a disaster! Right out of the box, it was nothing but a pain. Setup was complicated. The screen wasn’t responsive about half of the time. I couldn’t get the device to charge no matter how hard or many times I tried. The way you charge this and the proprietary charger itself is a nightmare. You don’t even get to see the charging status, if you can get it to start charging at all. The short time I was able to wear the device, it said I had over 2,700 steps in about 15 minutes. Without leaving my house. Apparently my heart rate also fluctuated between about 45 and 180 in that time as well. Basically impossible. Returning immediately. Will pay the same amount or just a bit more for a Garmin.

    Charge 3 bands fit and many app options
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purposely waited 2 weeks to post this review so I would know that the charge that lasted a week wasn’t a fluke. And it wasn’t. I received this unit exactly 2 weeks ago to the day, charged it to full and have only charged it on Sundays since.In full disclosure, I do not keep my phone’s Bluetooth setting on all the time, nor do I use all the available bells and whistles of the Charge 4, I only track certain parameters:• Steps and reminders to move (when studying and working, ya sometimes forget to get up!)• Stairs• Sleep (it’s kinda close most times)• Zone minutes• Miles• Calories and weight• Heart rate.I also track my fluid intake and only sync with the app once or twice daily. That’s all I need. I do participate in weekly, sometimes daily or weekend challenges and syncing like this serves this purpose as well.I don’t like the distraction of unnecessary notifications and I don’t give apps a lot of access to my personal info so the Fitbit app doesn’t have access to my contacts, texts, etc. and I don’t use GPS, the available training program, etc. Since I'm using an older S7 which doesn't have the battery life of newer Android phones, I don’t want to drain my phone’s battery with unnecessary power usage. Even with all the time I use it, this app doesn't do that.I occasionally give access to my location or utilize the activity timers. Activities are also customizable through the app. Contrary to the alert inside the app, location is not necessary to sync – only Bluetooth communication between the unit and the app. If you’re a marathon runner or you like tracking everything, the Charge 4 is an inexpensive way to enable many connectivity options.I’m very happy that the Fitbit-compatible bands I used with my Charge 3 also fit this model (pictured). As with the Charge 3, the description says this unit comes with 2 bands but it’s really 1 ½ so if you damage the clasp, you can’t use either. Also, the original bands aren't as adjustable as I'd like, whether you use the large or small. Fortunately, there are many options out there that are even better than the basic bands included with the unit.My only other complaint is that the charger is attached to a slow charging cable, so it matters not if I plug this into a fast charging outlet. It takes a long time to charge but, since I’m only charging once weekly, I guess I can live with that.Almost forgot to mention that the clock face options have greatly improved since the last model. This is a very versatile tool at a great price point. In response to the pandemic sitch, there's an option in the app for free access to training tools for which there's usually a fee (for a limited time). The available challenges and community resources can be quite useful, especially now if you’re feeling isolated or just need to learn new fitness methods. Once you set up your unit to your liking, you'll quickly get the hang of it, I think it'll be a great addition to anyone's health and wellness routine, beginners and beyond.

  Very disappointed in Fitbit in general at this point, but this product especially.  I have had trouble in the past with Fitbit not tracking my heart rate during workouts.  I decided to go all out and buy the charge 4 because of the reviews.  It ended up having the same issues as my previous Fitbit, which was the charge 2, where once I started sweating, it seemed like it just couldn't accurately track my heart rate. If I looked to check where my heart rate was it was either blank or super low.  You can see in the picture I added, it did fine at first but then dropped off even though my workout didn't change. I would compare my heart rate on the treadmill and it was usually way off.  But if I was just sitting or walking it would do just fine. I tried wearing it in different positions and adjusting it's tightness and nothing seemed to help. Once I started sweating it just struggled. I'm disappointed that a 4th generation of this model of Fitbit selling for $140 could still struggle so much.  Not sure if it's because I have hairy arms, or I sweat too much, either way I feel like there really shouldn't be any excuse.  That being said, the GPS, sleep tracker, step counter, and other features are great.  Just not worth the price.

I will spend a couple of hours in the evening watching TV and frequently calls that sleep. Four months into it, I’m still trying to figure out why that happens.

  I purchased the Fitbit Charge 4 to replace an aging Withings Activité Pop.  While rich in features, I will be returning the Charge 4 due to poor battery life and other drawbacks.- Battery life:  The advertised ""up to 7 day"" battery life is a fantasy, perhaps achievable if you leave the Fitbit unused in a drawer all week.  In normal use, the battery only lasts about two days.  Tracking a 45 minute jog brings a full charge down to 80% and a three hour hike from full to 50%.  Compared to the Withings, which uses a watch battery that must only be replaced annually, the constant need to charge the Fitbit is disappointing.- Activity tracking is hit-or-miss:  In several instances the Fitbit did not automatically recognize and track jogs or long walks.  In other instances tracking has stopped part way through an activity and then restarted recording as a new activity.  In the app, I end up with multiple entries for a single activity, with no way to merge the data.- Fitbit pay interface is slow:  The ability to pay wirelessly from the Fitbit seems useful.  I have not been able to test the feature in real life due to COVID-related closures and restrictions.  However, the interface to input the 4-digit pin is complicated and would likely be slow and annoying in a real word setting.  Hopefully Fitbit updates the interface.

  So just like another review on here ... my fitbit will not turn on during the setup ... it will slightly vibrate when I press the side button but the screen will not turn on at all.  So disappointed ... will try more but I think I will be returning it tomorrow 😥🥺  Update!!! I got it working and now it seems to be good ... steps are accurate and also the GPS is great.  Originally marked it as a 1 star but bumped it up to 3 since it is working well now.

  The watch looks good and is comfortable, but beyond that it is basically worthless.There are days when I have hardly moved at all and the device is telling me that I've got up 10 flights of stairs and walked 6k steps.I get 8 hours of sleep and sometimes only 4-5 hours are registered.I'm on an exercise bike going hard and it says my BPM is at 75.I pick the watch up off the counter to put it on and it reads 120 BPM even never having come into contact with my skin.Sometimes the menu only shows the first two options and I can't access the other three pages by swiping.It tells time but I have absolutely zero confidence in the exercise metrics.

  I tried this device for 3 weeks.  Most of the time I felt it was reasonably accurate, for steps, floors, and heart rates in resting and ""fat burn"" zones.  However, the main reason I bought this thing was to measure my heart rate at the top of my exercise capacity.  It was erratic and inaccurate with this specific task.  I would be working hard, and by taking my pulse estimate 150s, and it would show 114.  Sometimes it would freeze then stutter back.  I might just spring for a chest strap.  For more context, I am a very petite female, wrist barely the 5.5 inches they said it would fit, doing HIIT.  I am certain I was wearing snugly with proper placement.

  I love the new Fitbit with all then updated features. I only wish it was more customizable like my Charge 2 was. I have apps on things on it that I will not use, so I had to uninstall them. No way to reorder the apps, you have to scroll through everything. I wish there were more fun looking clock faces with the date. I did settle on one I like. The clock  doesn't always turn on when you flip your wrist over, also no setting to enable or disable this feature. I like that it has a sleep mode and Do Not Disturb mode. I love that it has the weather!! That's awesome.Overall I am very happy. I hope they update their app so some of my issues are resolved.

    Built-in GPS is practically useless
  
",2.0,Wayne Adamson,"Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  I like the Fitbit Charge 4 in many ways, but the main reason I got it was for the built-in GPS. Sadly, its performance was very poor. I have a 5.1 mile run that I do several times a week, and generally track it with MapMyRun. For the same route, the Fitbit Charge 4 logged 4.8 or 4.9 miles. This makes a big difference for the pace. What really was a 9'40"" pace was only reported as a pace of 10'18"", for example. Once the distance is wrong, all the the other measurements are compromised as well. When I looked at the map of the route as recorded by Fitbit, I could see what the problem was.  It cut corners all over the place, and even reported me as having gone through yards and houses! It was so far off. I also tried GPS tracking with Glonass ""on"" in the settings, and it didn't help. If you are looking for a fitness tracker or smart watch with a good built-in GPS, I suggest you look elsewhere.

I finally got it to connect to my account but it didn't want to sync to apps, count steps, register sleep, or anything else. I returned it because of these issues and received a replacement two weeks later. Exact same issues happened but this time, the display shut off after I connected it to my account. Did the initial troubleshooting that I've seen on some of the comments on the 1-star reviews but nothing works. Looks like I will be returning another one and never buying another Fitbit product.

  As a device this is a great tracker/watch. I really like it. The problem, and it seems to be a charge 4 and not a charge 3 thing, is that there is a noticable gap between the device and the band it came with. I haven't found any solutions to the issue aside from going through warranty, and looking at Fitbit's customer forums that describe the same problem there's no resolution even with device replacement. So know that going in. Still a decent device.

  I find the Charge 4 cannot be used without a smartphone. The fitbit interface software for Windows implies that the charge 4 is fully compatible with Windows and provides interface software to install and sync with the charge 4.

  I have been wearing a Fitbit for several years.  My Charge 2 has finally worn out, so I thought I would replace it with brand, new technology in the Charge 4.  The Charge 4 did not recognize my first night of sleep, my burn was significantly lower than it has ever been, it didn't auto recognize my walks that my Charge 2 always recognized, and my number of hours with 250 steps for the first day said 13 of 14 on my device but recorded on the app as 3 of 14.  No matter how many steps I took from the Fitbit troubleshooting website, NOTHING would work to give me my hours with 250 steps  back.  So, after 24 hours, I sent it back and bought a Fitbit Charge 3, which I love.  Fitbit should do WAY more testing before launching a product with so many issues.

  Overall I am very disappointed. I did a lot of research on which fitness tracker I wanted. I specifically looked for sleep tracking as a large component. I was very excited to get the Charge 4 because it wasn't so clunky looking and it was supposed to do everything I wanted.If you're looking for anything more than a step counter, don't waste your money. This thing looses my hear rate constantly. All other forms of tracking rely on an accurate HR. It tracks my sleep maybe once a week if I am lucky. I always check to make sure it is tracking my heart rate before I go to sleep and my the time I wake up there is no data. The active minutes for weightloss, don't track because it never knows what my heart rate it. Basically every time I look at my watch it is not tracking my HR. I have to take it off and put it on several times for it to pick up.I have tried all the things FitBit suggest to do to help the problem and none of them work. They know it is an issue and have no fix for it. Veey disappointing. Its basically a very expensive step counter. At least it can integrate with other fitness and food tracking apps.

  I have been using Fitbit devices for about 5 years. I have always used the Charge and always been very happy. I love the app. i don’t care about bells and whistles. I like the heart rate monitor and tracking exercise/steps.A few reasons why this device feels like a huge disappointment - enough that I’m going to try to either return it or sell it.1) something changed with the screen or light on this device and you can no longer read it when using polarized sunglasses. WTF? I have it on the brightest setting so it’s not that.2) I absolutely hate the new user interface. It’s difficult to use and not intuitive whatsoever. I hate how you have to swipe across to find things and the touch screen and side touch button is a bad upgrade and finicky. What was wrong with the regular button? I just find myself frustrated everytime i need to track something and often “accidentally” am ending workouts early or they turn off on their own bc someone’s brushed up against it. There are so many stupid pointless screens. How could this design even fly? Did they even test it? Crazy.3) the screen scratched up basically within days of using. I didn’t “do” anything to cause this like falling or impact so I’m guessing it was so minor bump up but now is a giant scratch. These screens should be more resilient.4) why is there no “exercise” function for yoga or really any basic “stationary” exercise like weight training etc? The closes thing is called “outdoor exercise”. Kind of weird.5) the battery feels worse than the prior version.I’m trying to think of a single reason i like this but frankly the charge 2 was leaps and bounds better. I only upgraded bc it was no longer working. Frustrated by this product and wanted to share an honest review.

    Does not track heart rate during exercise!
  
",1.0,Matthew Blaschke,"Reviewed in the United States October 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  Bottom line: Although it has some fun and useful features, the Fitbit Charge 4 fails in its essential mission of actually tracking heartrate during exercise.The FitBit Charge 4 could have been a great mid-range fitness tracker.  It has GPS capabilities and a suit of cool apps that track everything from calories burned to quality of sleep.  And FitBit's ""Zone Minutes"" are an elegantly simple way to capture exercise time.  But most of these features are made useless by the Charge 4's failure to consistently read my heartrate during exercise.  And the more intense the exercise, the worse the Charge 4 performs.  I've tried repositioning the Charge 4 on my wrist, tightening (and then loosening) the band, and cleaning the pulse sensor -- all to no avail.  Rather than display my pulse accurately during exercise, the Charge 4 often just shows two dashes, indicating that it cannot read my pulse.  According to FitBit's own message boards, this is a common problem for which there is fix (other than what I've described above)  That should be a deal breaker for anyone who wants a fitness tracker that actually, you know, tracks exercise.

  I've been in a frustrating back-and-forth with Fitbit customer service for longer than the device functioned. It died almost exactly a month after purchase. It simply stopped accepting a charge. Once the battery died it was just a bracelet. Let me be clear. The product itself was frustrating from the start. When I was able to use it, the GPS was very inaccurate and the activity tracker would stop unexpectedly mid-exercise. This is such a bummer. I've been using some kind of a Fitbit since January of 2014. It's cool to have all that data in once place. I guess I need to look into migrating it elsewhere. I don't usually spend the time to write a review. But if I can help others avoid this lousy device and the even worse customer service, I figured it was worth taking a few minutes to document.

    TRACKER doesn't last as long as advertised

  I've used a fitbit for 4 years and all of the have been true to holding a charge for the amount of hours stated in the product manual. The fitbit 4 however did not,  It only lasted half of the days. Only 4 out of the 7 that the product was advertised to last. After speaking with customer service I was informed that the TRACKER would last 7 days only if the GPS , always connect,  and other features were not used. I'm disappointed because those are the features that I wanted the TRACKER for!! It's not as ADVERTISED!!! SO DISAPPOINTED. I was also told to let the battery run completely out and then recharge the TRACKER using it Without using GPS. Also Frequently checking the Fitbit app, which syncs your tracker2. Frequently receiving notifications3. Frequently checking your stats using Quick View.Use without these things and then call back and let Support know how many days the TRACKER lasted.I just don't want to use my tracker Without the advertised features.Very disappointed!

  This tracker is the worst. When the steps try to sync with the app, more than a thousand steps can be lost at a time, and Fitbit then minuses the step count and is completely unreliable. I contacted Fitbit today and got zero help after being on hold for over 30 minutes. Basically was told that all their devices are glitching, and they have their team working on it, but no refund or replacement would be sent because it wasn't bought on their site. Our family has purchased nearly 20 fit bits over the years, and this will be our last. Extremely poor customer service and willingness to help in a situation they rightly admitted was their issue. The Fitbit had been used less than two weeks. Absolute junk

    Solid Well Made Tracker
  
",4.0,Wang Wang,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2021","









  
  
    
  I've had this for nearly 3 months now and have worn it just about all but 2 of those days.Pros:VERY COMFORTABLE: I don't even notice I'm wearing it even when sleeping. The band is a nice rubbery plastic as is the casing. They both feel nice in your hand and on your wrist.EASY TO USECUSTOMIZABLE. Not great but good enough. Different options for digital watch faces, and a small list of activities you can add to it to track. (example you can tell it your doing weight lifting or swimming and it adjusts what it tracks accordingly). You can also buy new bands if yours breaks or you want a different color.APP SUPPORT: is well done. Easy to navigate. Not ugly. Does a fairly good job of explaining what you're looking at and whats important. Although the communities while good in theory are not that great. Its a lot of people trying to promote themselves or post pictures that clearly aren't them. It doesn't do much for the motivation.GUIDED WORKOUTS and GOALS. You get them through the app but sadly are only available if you subscribe to the premium service. If you do that I think they're worth it. They certainly dont hurt.Cons:SCRATCH RESISTANCE. Watch face is can be easily scratched. I scratched mine a few weeks ago while indoor climbing (also climbing is not a sport fitbit has an option to track :(  ). Its probably a price issue but it would be much better if it were covered in some scratch resistant glass rather than plastic. It is an activity tracker and in sports or outdoor activities there's always the possibility of something getting knocked around. The casing is also plastic and it would be nice to see a more durable plastic or other material used there as well.WAKE DISPLAY: on movement detection isn't the best. Often times I lift my hand or turn my wrist to look at the time and the watch doesn't wake up. I have to press the side of it to activate the display.FEATURES BEHIND SUBSCRIPTION SERVICE: Some of the features of the Charge 4 are only usable if you're subscribed to their Fitbit Premium service.Other:ACCURACY. Not so much of a con, but I just wonder how accurate it is especially when it comes to sleep tracking. I suppose at the worst its an estimate to give you a better idea of whats going on.

  I had the AltaHr before this for 2 yeassband decided it was time to upgrade. I waited for the Black Friday sale and got mine for about $50 cheaper than usual! I’ve had it for just over two months now and really love it. Heart rate tracking is important to me since it motivates me when I see calories burned from a work out. I know it may not be 100% accurate but I know it’s within the ballpark and that makes me happy.Just like the previous fitbits it sets reminders for you to get up and walk. Working from home, i can forgot easily to get up and stretch my legs so this really helps me stay on track.I really love FitBit products and I say maybe wait for the next sale (I think they have them often) if you are on the fence.

  I bought this, excited for it to work. It works about 25% of the time if I line it up with the clearest part of my tattooed arm. This is a known issue however they do not advertise it and will not refund you for it. So basically I have a defunct heart rate monitor that is only frustrating to use as it will not track at the times you want it most. Also the sleep function is comically bad. The only solution I was suggested was putting an epoxy sticker over the led light that measures heart rate. This produces a value but not remotely close to the same value when I do catch my heartrate for a few moments without it - so who is to say what is accurate. Do not recommend fitbit is a scam.

  I won't be like everyone who gives a bad review because they clearly got a dud (or user-error as it often is). I'll give it an honest assessment.The app is amazing, that goes without saying. The quality of the band is nice, but it's a bit hefty, made bulkier by the textured diamond pattern in the band. The clasp is a bit cumbersome as well, and feels a bit like cheap plastic. I'll reserve my judgments on that until it breaks. Doesn't inspire confidence though.The watch itself seems to be very accurate, it's comfortable, and has some nice options. The pressure button on the side is a little hard to press, I wish you could change the settings for the sensitivity. When pressing, it requires you to stabilize the other side with your thumb or else you'll just push the watch causing it to slide toward your hand. The UI on the app is clean and simple, although I wish it allowed to customization. I don't need all the settings and stats it comes with, and many you cannot remove from the UI. This makes you scroll more than you'll probably want to to get to the features you like. If we could at least re-order them, that'd allow for quicker navigation.My final note is battery life. FitBit claims 7 days of battery life. Today is Thursday at 8:41pm. I'm at 70%. I gave it a full charge all night Tuesday into Wednesday morning. Within an hour of pulling it off the charger it was down by 5%. At the current rate, it'll likely be dead by Sunday which is closer to 4 days. Keep in mind, since I charged it fully, I have NOT exercised. It's quarantine and I'm lazy. I can imagine the battery would only last 2-3 days with moderate to heavy frequent exercise.That's my review. Don't got much else to say. It's a decent watch, but I'd wait for it to go on sale.

    Does NOT Track Fitness or Sleep - Do Not Recommend
  
",1.0,lrschmidt,"Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  The Charge 4 does NOT work accurately or reliably. I upgraded to this after my Charge 2 wore out (had it for 4 years, daily use). It does not consistently track my exercises or sleep stages. It also does not work with phone notifications. It doesn't alert me when I have a text or call like it's supposed to do. I've had it for 3 months, and it hasn't worked well since I got it (see more detailed review below).  I do NOT recommend this.I exercise 6 to 7 days a week. The Charge 4 does not register that I've completed the daily exercise and doesn't register active zone minutes consistently. I like to see how many times per week and per month I worked out, and normally, fitbit tracks this and makes it easy to see at a glance. The Charge 4 does not track it. In the last 4 weeks, I worked out all but 4 days total. The Charge 4 shows that I only worked out once per week. It's inaccurate and does not track. The active zone minutes sometimes track correctly, but it's really inconsistent. The active zone minutes also do not appear to sync with the daily exercise tracking. If using the fitbit to track anything resulted to exercise, it's useless.I also went with the Charge 4 because of its  increased sleep tracking capabilities. More often than not, it does not register my sleep stages or heart rate fluctuations. It says it couldn't do so. This is incredibly frustrating as this was one of the main reasons I went with the Charge 4.I did not have these issues with my Charge 2. The Charge 4 has not worked well at all for the full 3 months I've had it. At most, it registered if I did a 20 to 30 minute walk, but any other exercises I have done do not register or track.I do not recommend this, and I'm highly disappointed and dissatisfied with the Charge 4, especially for the price I paid. It's also frustrating that I bought a new fitbit, to track fitness and sleep, and it does neither. I've tried adjusting settings, switching wrists, different tightness of the band, and where on my wrist I wear it. It does not work.

  I really liked my Charge 2, but unfortunately after years of use it was barely holding a charge anymore. So I though it was time to upgrade and got the latest gen. It is a serious downgrade and barely worth $20 IMO While my charge 2 was decently accurate with tracking my heart rate when compared to taking it manually the new charge 4 is way off the mark. If I am doing cardio the charge 4 either barely notices my heart has increased and if it does start to pick it up it is almost 30-50 bpm off.I went online to research a fix and apparently it is a pervasive problem and there is no solution. The ones offered by fitbit staff on their website like resetting the watch or reinstalling the app do nothing. I guess it is just another company that lost its quality when it got too big, especially after they got bought by google.Either way the whole point of a fitness tracker is to track data and if the data isn't accurate what is the point.

  I love Fitbit. I do. I had a Charge 2 and now have the Charge 4, so I am still surprised that Fitbit still has not figured out how to gage an accurate heart rate. The heart rate monitor can take some 20+ minutes of exercise before it starts gaging accurately and sometimes it just never does. I'm wearing a Polar heart monitor on my chest at the same time. When my heart monitor is measuring 165 bpm (and I know it's accurate), my Fitbit is measuring 90 or so, maybe low 100s. I've tried moving the device to the backside of my wrist, but my heart rate only moved up to the low 120s. The strap cannot be any tighter on my arm.  This wasn't just once. It was again and again. So if the heart rate is off, the calories burned will be off as well. Calories burned on any wearable device is usually off according to multiple studies. A bad heart rate just makes it worse. Not that Google owns Fitbit, I'm hoping this changes on future devices.I do love the sleep tracker and the hydration tracker. The app is great, especially if you are tracking your food, but some of the calorie counts on scanned food items are not accurate and there appears to be no easy way to correct a wrong calories count on food. But I've only seen this a few times and usually by 5 calories or less.Charge 4 is good device... just know why you are buying it and what to expect.

  I am an absolute fan of FitBit products, particularly the Charge family. In fact, I’ve been using FitBits since they debuted. When my Charge 2 started to have issues holding a charge a few weeks ago, I started saving for the replacement. Since it lasted me so long (they are durable!), FitBit had already come out with the 4.I love the upgraded screen, FitBit settings, and expanded exercise list with the Charge 4. I haven’t synced to my Spotify account, but I like that I could if I wanted to. I also like that I can put the FitBit into Do Not Disturb and Sleep life’s to prevent cellphone/text notifications any time I want. (I like to dedicate my workout time to my actual workouts and actually won’t even bring my phone into the gym so people can’t distract me from my workout or interrupt me.)That being said - I have to clean it after every single workout. Years and years ago, FitBit bands were permanently attached to the watch face. The adhesive, when combined with sweat, caused people to have allergic reactions. I was one of them and still carry permanent scarring on my wrist where the reaction had caused my skin to rip open. They fixed this when they moved to the detachable bands. However - I noticed I started having allergic reactions to the Charge 4 a couple hours after my workout. If I clean the watch back with rubbing alcohol after my workout and let it dry - I don’t seem to have an issue. I’m concerned about the charging port now being the source but so far - as long as I clean it immediately after, there are no issues at all and the raised red bumps I experienced the first 2 days has completely subsided.**Edit**I had to take another star off. I also cannot sleep in it due to the stationary position, which keeps the tracker in one place too long. Woke up with a reaction under the tracker. So I will no longer be able to track my sleep. Still love the interface - bittersweet having issues with another FitBit produce after my Charge 2 did so well for years!!

On week 6 I started getting a message that the GPS was unable to get a signal.  Searched Fitbit's site for why this might be happening but they just blame it on clouds, trees etc.  The same 3 mile loop that the GPS mapped for weeks, now can't be found by the GPS.  Walked at the beach several days -- clear blue skies and no trees or obstructions and the GPS still can't find me!  Very disappointing.  Seems it's a very common occurrence on the Fitbit forums and the only solution found is to return it and buy something else.

I have owned a Surge, Versa, multiple Flexes to name a few of the products. This however last round of issues has convinced me that I would probably be better off paying a higher price for a more reliable product. For myself, I switched to a Garmin Venu since my versa died about 14 months after buying  it and it died to a firmware update as well. Since it was out of warranty they would only offer me a 20% discount on the same product. For what it is worth, my family has decided that FitBit is not the way to go for us and as our current FitBits die we will look for other products.

    Piece connecting the band to device broke
  
",5.0,Sarah Fietz,"Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  I liked the Fitbit charge. It motivated me to move more and I really liked the GPS tracking for when I'd do long bike rides. On Friday the small black piece that is on the fitbit and anchors the band to the device broke. The most extreme activity I did with it was...wait for it...walk in the lazy river at a Great Wolf Lodge with my 1 year old. I've had it for less than two months so it really shouldn't have broken. I hope someone replies to this message because I'd like to exchange it or have it repaired. I really like the device. For $150.00 it should stand up to the lifestyle of a work from home mom...

    Not live GPS

  Great watch I purchased the Fitbit for my mother. She loves keeping up with her steps. Thing is she  suffers from dementia so I thought this would be perfect knowing she wouldn't go anywhere without wearing it because she wants it to count her steps. And  I could track her in case she wonders off. Every thing would have been perfect if it had live GPS but apparently it just tells you where you been. So I am still searching for a watch that has live GPS. But all in all it was a great watch

    Charge 4 not ready for prime time
  
",2.0,Jim S.,"Reviewed in the United States September 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  Bought the Charge 4 to replace my tired and screen not working Charge 2.  The Charge 4 setup was easy and everything worked well for the first few months.  One morning the sync process stop working, and was very irregular.  Now working to get a replacement.  Given the numerous other having the same issue, it must be a design flaw or software issue that Fitbit isn't able to resolve.  I would suggest going with the Charge 3 or waiting for new version when Fitbit is able to get the product stabilized.Update: Contacted Fitbit about the sync problem.  After about a 10 minute conversation to verify the problem, Fitbit decided to replace the Charge 4.  Within 5 days I had a new Fitbit.

    Total junk
  
",1.0,PorkChop,"Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2021","









  
  
    
  So, my charge 4 only lasted 8 months and is now unusable. My other grievances are that it’s uncomfortable to wear, and Fitbit locks out features unless you pay a monthly subscription on top of the price of the actual Fitbit. Fitbit already gets my data, Fido they need to be greedy and charge a sub too? Also the Fitbit app is terrible to navigate and use. I tried to contact Fitbit they the app and forum but it blocked my request.Don’t waste your time or money. I should have just ponied up and bought an Apple Watch. It would be cheaper in the long run even at twice the price. Fitbit is a totals sham.

    Inaccurate, stresses me out.
  
",3.0,The Bio-Engineer,"Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  There is a couple of things to like and dislike about it.Heart rate:What I mostly dislike is the SLOW Health rate reader. To give an example. I do high intensity interval's. When I am on my peak the watch says my heart rate is at 130. When I manually check it by hand it's on 184. It takes the watch another 10 seconds to reach then 171 heart rate and then it begins dropping never reaching the peak. Some other times I am at my peak. I've tried to put the watch in different spots in the wrist, I've followed all the instructions and even tried adjusting the straps from very tight to loose and none have made it more accurate.GPS:Wow this was surprisingly inaccurate. Please see the picture as it explains itself. I started running half a mile behind my friend. When we finished together my watch said I had ran 1 more like than him. That's all because of the inaccuracy. Plus the pace was all wrong.I would suggest buying a Garmin watch, my friend had a Garmin and his results where MUCH nor accurate.Sleep:It's not the most accurate, but I can't say much since I don't have other device to compare. I can say that one day it said I was on deep sleep just before walking up and I remember I was already awake and just starting at the roof. So my hopes are not high for this feature being accurate.Only buy this if accuracy is not what you are looking for and you just want something to kinda track your exercises.  But if you like to be more precise, don't, since it will stress you out.

    Review after 30 days
  
",3.0,mohitgupta,"Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2021","









  
  
    
  It was a decent buy but I was not super impressed by it. The battery life is not as per advertised I feel. I did not use GPS but still it consistently lasts only for around 5 days against the advertised 7 days. One other important that I noticed is that if I tie my fitbit charge 4 too tight on my wrist, it messes up the sleep calculation. I think I consciously tied it tighter for 3 nights and all 3 nights, it did not give me a sleep score saying that I was too restless. But, I feel its due to some technical issue. This actually was concerning since now I am not sure how reliable is the heart rate sensor on my fitbit. Overall, I think I like the design and it is very comfortable. You can easily wear it all the time without noticing which is not true for (say) apple watch. This is the best thing about charge 4. I think fitbit still needs to work on quality and is not on par with apple. I agree there is a difference in price but accuracy and battery life are 2 important things which shouldnt depend on it. Overall, I think its still a good buy!

  It will take you a long time to disable all the nagging, infantile alerts, goals, badges, and other nonsense that amount to distractions and insulting ""gold stars"" for arbitrary metrics.  I'm sure they would motivate someone in grammar school but for adults it's quite insulting.Not only that when your wrist tracker suddenly goes off on a vibrating spree and you look down to see one of these notifications the only thing accomplished is interrupting your efforts.Basic HRM functionality seems to work relatively well with the caveat that optical is less accurate than a chest strap, but I knew that going in.Sleep analysis is moderately useful.  While overall accuracy is again suspect, it can serve as a baselining tool for trend analysis.Had I to do over again, I would not buy this item because it has been more annoying than useful.

",4.0,,"Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2021","









  
  
    
  I believe that this new Fitbit Charge 4 is the best fitness tracker you can buy at this time on the market. Pretty much all the changes in the Charge 4 are with sports tracking. Charge 4 can only hold six pre set shortcuts to workout modes on the device itself. So if you are looking for a whole list or workouts or exercises you may get on a smart watch, you will not get it on this one.The new GPS features get distance, pace, speed, time, heart rate – while workouts such as weights, for example, are about time, calories, heart rate and not rep counting or anything crazy specific.My battery life has been somewhere between five and six days, which is pretty good considering I wear it for sleeping too.

  I started out really happy with the Charge 4.  However, now after a month of having it, it won't stay paired with my iphone.  I've reached out  to Fitbit support and they haven't been helpful.  After nearly 2 weeks of back and forth emails, the are implying it's a software/firmware issue.  I've sent them rebooted the device, factory reset the Charge 4, upgraded the iOS on my iphone, tried pairing it to an iPad, all to no avail.  The responses are starting slow down from their support team.  Seems wrong that they continue to sell the Charge 4 if this is a software/firmware problem as this renders the Fitbit completely useless.  If it's a hardware problem, I don't understand why they won't honor their warranty and send me a new Charge 4.  I used to be very positive on the Fitbit.  My entire family has Fitbits.  At this point, I'm seriously look around for other devices as the $150 I've spent is basically wasted away now.In summary do NOT buy a Charge 4.

    Charge 4 and Fitbit are a big disappointment.
  
",2.0,Conner,"Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  Honestly pretty disappointing. I bought this to replace my series 2 Apple Watch so that I could track my sleep. The Charge 4 advertises a week battery life, but I don’t think mine lasts more than a few days without needing recharging. I tracked a 7.7 mile hike today, but it only recorded it as 3.6 miles. It also went from 95% battery to 6% in about 3 hours of tracking. I tried to edit the distance in the app but it would not save the change. Then it stopped showing the option to edit it.Overall the sleep tracking is good, but you have to pay for their premium subscription to get full data, which is stupid. The app sucks and often has bugs and fails to sync.Also, this won’t natively sync with Apple health and the third party apps don’t completely work either. I am returning this and getting a new Apple Watch, and maybe some other small device to wear in bed to track sleep.

    FITBIT IS PINCHING PENNIES, ANTICIPATE BUYING ACCESSORIES,
  
",3.0,MilesAway,"Reviewed in the United States August 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is my third Fitbit.  The first was an Ionic model, which was replaced under warranty because it had problems charging.  The replacement ended up having the same problems withing a few weeks of light use.I've since purchased this model and straight out of the box I'm a bit disappointed.  Fitbit has incorporated a clip on charging cord which should be an improvement of the last one. Unfortunately the charging cord is short, at most a few inches more than one foot. Since the cord isn't long enough to reach from any standard height US outlet to any common piece of furniture I'm looking at purchasing a longer cord.Secondly, the last model had large and small bands that were two pieces. For this model Fitbit included an extra receiving end that is longer than the other.  I was rather disappointed that they aren't actually large and small but rather long and short.Having purchased two (one is for my wife) I anticipate buying two new cords and at least one band.  I don't expect to pay more than $30 for these items, but I do feel a bit ripped off.  I few extra pennies in materials could have provided buyers with decent bands and a useful charging cord.I also find the useless cord to be wasteful.  Why even include an item very few, if any, people will utilize?

  The Fitbit features work well, like tracking sleep accurately, steps, heart rate, etc.  The bad point is that lately it has to be re-paired with my wife's phone EVERY DAY! Fitbit support is no help, they are mostly of the 'turn if off and on again' type of assistance, as if we can't figure that out ourselves!We can't return it to Amazon, because it's past the return window.Fitbit won't allow returns or exchanges because we didn't buy it directly from them.So we are stuck with this bad Fitbit.SAVE YOUR MONEY, DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU LIKE AGGRAVATION.

  Have been a Fitbit user since the clip on model and I just love these watches!! They do all they say they do and very well! I just highly recommend you get a protection plan because problems do arise usually after a couple years... screen goes black or something like that. Protection plans will cover you. The Fitbit is totally worth it. I’m getting one now for my 95 year old mom— want to see how often she’s up at night and maybe the step count will motivate her to be more active... plus heart rate etc— I’m a longtime Fitbit fan.... highly recommend! I have Fitbit Charge 4 now and have had numerous previous models. Don’t want the bulk of the models more similar to the Apple Watch... don’t need all that on my watch when I have my phone! But any model you choose I’m sure you’ll be happy with it.Amazon  sells various styles of  bands at reasonable prices too!

  Bought a fitbit charge 4 for my husband to use to track his daily walks, as an alternative to Map my walk on his phone, as it advertised GPS and exercise tracking.  It is not user friendly and does not operate the way all the you tube videos claim.  Can't change the clock face, the GPS tracker that maps your route looks like a 4 year old scribbled on a piece of paper.  He is OCD and doesn't walk like that.  Select walk from exercise, hit start and it may or may not start.  Today he hit start and when he returned an hour later it said he'd been walking for 7 minutes.  Definitely not worth the $129 I paid for it.  Map my walk is more accurate and easier to use.  Guess it works fine if you are just counting steps but a cheaper one will do the same.

  materials are nice and minimal. That's about all the good.The pins have finicky connects, so when you put it to charge and come back hours later, it could still be dead. Maybe it is just my unit, but I have been having this problem since I bought it. The ""button"" on the device is terrible and it's hard to get the device to actually register that you are pushing it. Spend your money elsewhere.

  My first fitness tracker, and after some research I decided on the Charge 4 — I loved the slim design, and it had GPS to track my mileage. I’m currently way out of shape, like pre-diabetic fat out of shape, so I needed something easy to give me metrics so I knew where I was and how far to get where I’m going. Tracking my exercise, sleep, water intake, etc has made me a healthier man these last few weeks. The charge lasts about 5 days, the app is v easy to use and even includes some meditation modules (woo-hoo!), and even connects to my smart scale so my weight and other bio markers are in the Fitbit for review. Can’t say enough good things about it!

  It's a daily struggle to sync my fitbit to my phone.  I only want two functions out of a device: sleep tracking and heart rate.  Every morning I need to re-pair my device and often it takes several minutes.  This problem persisted for my old phone and my new phone. Extremely obnoxious.Also the user interface has limited customization.  It frequently switches to showing metrics I don't care about at all and I have to flip through the metrics to bring back the screen I want to see.The app is cool, and the sleep analysis and other software features are cool.

  I have had my fitbit since September 2020.  I  have had no complaints until recently when I started wearing it at night. After 3 weeks or so I noticed a rash and peeling skin under the watch face on my left wrist.  I moved it to my right arm and after a few days I can see that a rash is beginning in the same place as the other arm. The rash on my left arm is still red and peeling.  bought an aftermarket watch band immediately after I bough the tracker as I dislike the plastic bands that come with the trackers.  There has been no rash under the band, only under the watch face. I would have rated my tracker highly as it does what I want it to do, however, none of the other fitbits that I have owned have ever given me a rash. This is a big problem for me as I will not be able to wear it as much as I would like. Therefor the low rating.  I hope the manufacturer will take note of all the people having rash problems and do something about it.
