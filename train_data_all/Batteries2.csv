  I replaced all my home smoke alarm batteries like always this new Year and have had 4 die since. So 4 out of 6 have failed in a 3.5 month period.So in conclusion these are turning out to be pretty bad batteries. About on part with the ultra cheap batteries from the dollar store or harbor frieght.

    Larger size 9V, no leakage warranty, individually shrink-wrapped
  
",2.0 ,The Engineer Critic,"Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2017","









  
  
    
  9V batteries are larger than most, so may not fit in some devices.  Batteries are individually shrink-wrapped, causing extra headache to open each package.  Batteries come with no guarantee against leakage causing damage to whatever they're installed in (unlike the guarantee provided by the Duracell, etc).

    Beware the Fit!
  
",1.0 ,G. R. Lewis,"Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2015","









  
  
    
  I have a Carvin electric bass guitar that has, like thousands of other instruments, an electronics module powered by two 9V batteries. When my latest set of Duracells began to fade, I popped in a couple of these and expected to be back in business. Wrong! I got no sound at all. I did the ""tongue test"" to verify that the batteries were alive (yow!), and double-checked I'd installed them properly. Zilch. In desperation I put the old Duracells back in, and they worked just fine.I'm an electronics engineer and this was a problem I had to find. On close examination, here's the only possibility I can come up with: the metal + and - terminals of the Duracell battery project slightly farther from the battery's case than the Amazon's do. Apparently this allows them to reach the two contacts inside the bass. Also, the Amazon battery is a bit thicker than the Duracell, but I don't think that's the source of the problem.These would probably work fine in any application that has an actual battery clip that snaps onto the battery terminals. But for ""drop-in"" installations, you'd better verify that they work.

  OK very important.  These batteries are a great price and do work fine electrically.  However, they ARE slightly larger than your typical better known brands.  This means in some applications these batteries may not fit.  Since the price and other qualities are good, I would suggest buying the smallest package of them to test in ALL your needed applications to see if they work for you.  They did fit in my wireless switches and volt meters.  They were almost to tight for my smoke detectors and I had to push them in to the point where they are jammed ... not the best but I got them in.  In certain other devices they were maybe just a millimeter or two to long and I had to go to the local drugstore and buy some well known much more expensive brand.  Amazon, love the product, please address the size issue.

  I don't write reviews very often, but felt compelled to call these batteries out. I am a big fan of Amazon Basics in general, so I thought I would give these a try to save money over name brands.

  These (and all Amazon basics batteries I have bought) have very short lifespan and last dramatically less than name brand batteries. I used their 9V when replacing batteries in our smoke detectors and was able to compare its performance against one regular-brand battery I replaced at the same time. The name brand battery is still working, and I've replaced the Amazon battery twice--which with a smoke detector comes from that annoying beeping which begins only in the middle of the night.I had thought batteries are a simple commodity and Amazon, or whomever it has contracted to make these, could make batteries of roughly the same quality as a name brand. I was definitely wrong. Buy a real brand.

I ordered a pack of these a couple months ago to change the batteries in all the smoke alarms I have, and once again the whole household was woken in the middle of the night as one, then two, then three alarms started beeping just weeks after installation.

  I received the batteries in a short period of time, which I needed in order to get my smoke detectors and carbon monoxide detectors working again. to get 8 for 10 bucks is phenomenal as the 9 volts that run the detectors, I prefer to replace all at the same time.  and as it is a safety issue, i needed them quickly since one of the detectors was already chirping and I replaced it with the 1 9volt battery I had left. the least expensive price locally was 13.99 for 4. the fact that i got 8 for less than 1.50 each is nice. it isn't high tech that I needed the batteries for but as they are replaced 1x a year minimum, 2x is recommended, this made the most sense for quantity and price. we'll see if they last til the spring time change. they had better make it past the fall time change.

  I love that Amazon is such a behemoth they make their own batteries. On a research-driven decision, they pass marginal savings along to us. The Amazon brand 9v batteries are INDIVIDUALLY SHRINKWRAPPED WITH VERY STRONG PLASTIC. As you may see, I scraped the paint off using a screwdriver to remove it.. Tip #1: start puncturing the plastic between terminals; Tip 2: allow a minute or three to get the plastic off. You cannot be in a hurry to replace the battery in your guitar pedal. An 8-pack should take no more than 30 minutes, if you want to open them all at once.

  With all of the large, multipack options for batteries, it's easy to over-buy and end up with dead batteries that have never been used. This was the case with my previous privately branded Amazon 9 volts. At first, I was dismayed to find that the batteries in storage were as dead as the one in the device needing an exchange. However, after searching my purchase history (thank you Amazon for this), I found that I had last bought them 6 years ago! My how time flies. So now I'm trying to be more realistic about my needs and buying smaller numbers. This might not sound like a money-saving plan, but finding 5 never used dead batteries certainly is not a money saver!

  I don't know yet how the batteries will hold up, but there is a problem with the invisible, tight plastic wrap around each of them.  If you are in a hurry and just load them into your smoke alarm, it will soon start chirping at you.  Once you realize the plastic wrap is there, it's not easy to remove.  One has to cut it with a sharp object that leaves me uneasy near the battery and it's a pain to rip it the rest of the way.  My suggestion for Amazon is to put a bright red ""pull tab"" and perhaps some serrations so customers would be sure to see the wrapper and then have a simple way to remove it.  One should not have to use tools in order to replace a battery.

  The rating on these seemed to be good, so unfortunately I didn't look in to them any further.  If I had, I never would have purchased them.  I, like several others, purchased them to be used in smoke detectors.  I installed them in 5 smoke detectors all on the same afternoon.  By 2am, less than 12 hours later, 2 of the smoke detectors started chirping because of a low battery.  By the time I removed the bad batteries in those 2 detectors, the other 3 had started chirping as well.  These are garbage!

  Earlier this year I bought the 8 pack of Amazon 9-Volt batteries for use in my garage door openers and smoke alarms.  I have had good experiences with other Amazon batteries (AA and AAA), so buying the 9-Volt seemed to be a no-brianer, especially given the significant cost advantage (just $10.99 for 8) compared to other national brands.Over the last four months I've used the Amazon 9 Volt batteries in two different style garage door openers and also my smoke alarms.  ALL GOOD.Some older (2018) reviews commented that the Amazon batteries were larger than others and would not fit into the reviewer's smoke alarm.  However, I compared the size of an older Duracell I removed from a smoke alarm last night with a  Amazon 9 volt I bought earlier this year.  They seem to be the same size.  If there was a problem some years ago, Amazon seems to have fixed fit.

  These 9-volt AmazonBasics batteries work exactly as expected, and are easily comparable to both Duracell and Energizer alkaline batteries in their performance and longevity. I have used them in various applications from stud finders, to smoke alarms, to voltage readers, as well as a Rode VideoMic Pro-R shotgun microphone. I have not yet found any gadgets in which they mysteriously do not fit as a result of being too small or improperly sized.These are very good batteries for the price, as because with all AmazonBasics products, you are getting good quality at a lower cost as a result of not paying for fancy packaging or marketing associated with the product.

    How is it even possible to make 9V batteries that are too big?

  The performance of these batteries so far seems pretty good, but they are a tiny bit larger than other 9V batteries - which is problematic.  I've got a couple of little battery-powered Christmas decorations.  Little LED-lighted Christmas trees made out of circuit boards, and the battery forms the trunk of the tree.  I've used all sorts of other batteries over the years with these decorations with no problem.  A couple of weeks ago I put these batteries in, and they almost wouldn't fit.  It took so much force to push them in place, I was worried that a) I might not be able to get them out again, and b) they might break the decoration.  When I did take them out, I can see marks on the battery casing from being forced into place.  I've never come across a battery that wasn't the standard size.  9V batteries have been around for decades, how could it even be possible to make them the wrong size?  I've seen other reports of these batteries not fitting in guitars and some smoke detectors.  I wish I had plaid closer attention to the reviews on this, but who woulda thunk that something like this could be an issue with batteries?  I'm sorry I ordered as many of them as I did, given that it's now a bit of a crap shoot as to whether I'll be able to use them or not.  I won't be buying them again - which is too bad, as I've usually been happy with my various Amazon Basics purchases.

  If you have a lot of smoke detectors in your house, this is the best way to deal with the constant need for 9 Volt batteries.

  Apologies as I didn't have my previous duracell 9v battery to compare it to but on the flipside I provided the other 2 types of batteries, a ruler to measure height to y'alls advantage, and a voltage check. But it fit my needs perfectly and all I had to wait was 2 days - can't get much better than that. Basically I had no issues with fitting it in my CO detector and it works correctly.Even if the lifetime of this amazon basics battery is 9/10ths of that to a duracell, (which is unlikely due to the voltage measurement I just took) honestly it's just a better price-point over time. If you're on the edge I'd say take the splurge you can power other electronics with an adapter for a pricepoint so cheap.

  This may sound crazy, but these batteries aren't the standard 9v size!  They are just a fraction of an inch thicker around the outside.  So small of a difference that it is imperceptible until you go to use this battery in something formed exactly to the standard 9V battery size.  In my case, I have a Taylor acoustic guitar.  It has a removable ""caddy"" for the battery.  The caddy needs to fit the battery tightly, because you don't want to hear a battery rattling around while you are playing.  Other name-brand batteries fit like a glove, but this battery simply would not fit.  I almost broke the caddy trying to force one of these before I gave up and bought a different brand.Fortunately, I have a lot of guitar pedals and other guitar accessories that use 9V and they do not have such tight constraints, so I was able to use these batteries just fine, and they perform well.  I was definitely disappointed to find that they wouldn't fit in my guitar, though, as that's the whole reason I ordered a new pack of 9Vs and thought I would try these out.

Went through the routine a third time -- and blessed silence!

So they are useless for this purpose, which is about the only use I have for 9v.

  The price is right but the batteries are individually shrink-wrapped in plastic - a hassle to cut and unwrap each one. The cardboard container is sturdy, but it seems a lighter-weight container would work just as well (that batteries are fairly sturdy, just like other 9V brands. I doubt there is a risk of damaging the batteries when they are shipped).

  Name brand costs less!Product is what you'd expect, a 9V battery.  They work, no issue.  My application is an electronic lock that sees daily use.  I formerly used Duracell.  The last two Duracell batteries lasted 211 and 253 days.  I switched to Amazon Basics to try to save a dollar or two.  The last two of these have lasted 69 and 68 days.  In short, the Durcells cost 2x more, but last 3x longer.  I'll be switching back when my 8-pack of Amazon Basics runs out.

  We purchased a set of these for smoke detectors.  First battery went bad in less than 10 months.  We then purchased more expensive name brand 9 volts at Target to replace them.

  Obviously my life has hit a new low because I'm sitting here on a Saturday morning reviewing Amazon Edition 9 Volt batteries. Anyways, I ordered 4. They arrived quickly and I had them in my smoke detectors within minutes. Packaging was tight, the batteries themselves are of quality, and they are considerably less expensive than what is carried at Walmart, Target, or at grocery stores. The only problem is, I apparently should have ordered 6 batteries because I'm hearing a distant smoke detector chirping at the moment and it's driving me nuts! In conclusion, order these batteries. You can't go wrong.

Now, when I need a battery I just go to the kitchen drawer and have whatever I need on hand.So far, I've experienced at least the same usable life as any other brand I've used.  Time will tell, but with the pricing on these batteries, I'll definitely be back.

  I bought these because I needed to replace batteries on my smoke and carbon monoxide detectors. I used 4 and each battery lasted about a week and two days before indicating low battery by the dreaded detector beeping sound. Other batteries I've used lasted for years, these not even two weeks. Luckily Amazon has great policies and I was able to get a refund for this product. Maybe I got a bad batch or something... I would not buy this product again.

  The price on these is good.  They seem to last a decent amount of time.  They have one serious flaw.  Every time I remove a battery from a device, the female terminal breaks away from the battery.  I have tried various ways of removing these, very carefully, and they still always break off. This has happened on multiple occasions.  Must be poorly connected at the factory.

Each battery measured approximately 9.6 volts when not under load which dropped to 9.5 volts under a 25 ma load.

  The least expensive way I could find to stop the horrible chirp when the smoke alarm decides it's time for a new battery. I found that it helps to remove the plastic wrap around the battery before you install it. That wrap is important because unlike any other type of battery, 9V batteries have both terminals exposed on the same end which makes it possible for them to make contact with some type of conductive material and start a fire. And when you dispose of these, make sure you put tape over the terminals for the same reason.

Plus, I don't like being woken up to the loud, annoying ""low battery"" beeping in the middle of the night. Call me lazy. These batteries are the best price I've found, even compared to Costco. Of course, Costco carries the Duracell brand, so I don't know how well they compare in terms of longevity. With changing them yearly, I guess it doesn't really matter.

The AmazonBasic 9 Volt batteries were roughly half the cost of the big names, and so far, they are working great in my devices. I am using them in guitars and related guitar effect pedals, and they really do the trick. The guitar tone is big and beefy, which you wouldn't get out of a wimpy battery.It's great that they offer an 8 pack, because I seem to be continuously running out of 9-volts, and I can get 8 here, instead of a two pack for the same price of the big names. Each battery came individually wrapped in plastic, to insulate the terminals and prevent discharge. They are housed in a purpose designed cardboard box, which keeps them nice and organized.PROS:+ Arrived fresh, full, powerful charge+ 8-Pack!+ Inexpensive+ Comes packaged in a neat little cardboard box to keep them organized in.CONS:- Haven't found any yet!

Almost immediately after installing them, I had issues with them going off. When the first one went off, I thought it was a fluke. It was summer and I thought *maybe* humidity was to blame. But then another went off and another. My kitchen counter has 5 smoke detectors with their batteries removed (only way we could stop them from going off). Today, after the 6th one went off, it finally dawned on me that maybe the batteries were to blame. We had the smoke detectors for a year (with the kidde battery that came with it) and never had a single one go off. So I started testing the new Amazon batteries, and sure enough, even the unused ones don’t have full power! Total crap!

    Results of capacity testing shows its slightly below the competition.
  
",5.0 ,August M.,"Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2018","









  
  
    
  I tested the AA size Amazon brand battery to find out the actual usable capacity as compared to the AA Duracell Procell battery. The results showed that the Amazon battery is about 88 percent the capacity of the Duracell. If you calculate the cost per unit capacity, the batteries are almost identical. The Amazon battery was actually slightly more expensive when represented in cost per Watt-Hour. Because of this I would probably choose the Procell (if I can get a good price on it) just because it means less frequent battery changes. The Amazon battery is a surprisingly good battery though. You will probably barely notice the difference in capacity, so if you don't want to waste time shopping around then its a good choice.I also performed the same test on Duracell Copper Top, and Energizer Max. Their performance was nearly identical to the Procell. More interestingly, I tested the Energizer Ultimate Lithium AA cell. This cell was 4 times the cost of a procell at $1.27 per cell! However the capacity was only 1.5 times that of the Procell. So don't waste your money on these batteries, they're much more expensive per unit of capacity.  The capacity of all these batteries were measured in Watt-Hours. Here are the numbers.AA Amazon Battery = 2.71 Wh. My cost per cell = $0.291. Cost per Watt-Hour = $0.107AA Duracell Procell = 3.09 Wh. My cost per cell = $0.321. Cost per Watt-Hour = $0.104AA Energizer Lithium = 4.86 Wh. My cost per cell = $1.27. Cost per Watt-Hour = $0.261This test was done using an op-amp circuit to maintain a constant current load at 100ma. Voltage and current were being logged ounce per minute and this data was used to calculate the Amp-Hour with a 0.8 volt cutoff. The Watt-Hour was then calculated by multiplying the Amp-Hour by the average voltage from the beginning of the test to 0.8 volts. All batteries mentioned were tested using this same method. Note that the capacity of these batteries can change dramatically under different conditions. The same battery under a heavy load will have a fraction of the capacity that it would under a light load. This data is only good for a comparison when choosing what battery is worth buying at what price. Unless your device loads the battery at a constant current of 100ma.In summery, the Amazon batteries are not bad batteries (at least based on this test using the AA cell). If you choose to shop around for a name brand battery, stay at or below $0.33 per cell. Anything above $0.33 per cell will be more expensive per unit capacity than the Amazon battery. Oh, and definitely stay away from the Energizer Lithium unless expense is not an issue. These batteries are only worth the additional cost if your application requires a light weight and relatively high capacity battery regardless of cost. These batteries are surprisingly light weight compared to an alkaline.

Half of the batteries have discharge and corrosion inside the plastic wrapping. Did not have issues when I did use the other batteries but was disappointed when I had to replace one of the batteries in one of my devices and found out I didn't have as many batteries as I expected. The strength of the batteries was adequate but I would avoid buying in bulk as they may not last.

  We have a heavy duty smoke alarm and carbon monoxide detector in one, an average 9V battery from Duracell was lasting us right around 20 days, the dollar store kind lasted just about 2 weeks, and the Amazon brand lasted about 23 days. When comparing prices per unit these were clearly the better buy, and it’s nice to have months worth on hand so when your smoke alarm’s low-battery-notifier starts beeping in the middle of the night and you must remove the battery, you can replace it immediately, giving you peace of mind and one less thing to put on your to do list. This is one of the most important household subscriptions I get through Amazon, and frankly it’s a steal.

  These are a little bit less expensive than name brand batteries and appear to last as long. 9 volts is an odd size but for some reason are required in a lot of home electronics.

  I almost felt like doing a ""unboxing"" for these - they are so nicely packaged!  I really don't have a lot of expectations from a 9V battery and the only reason I have them, is to backup my hardwired smoke detectors.  I replace my batteries twice a year in them (as recommended by the National Fire Protection Agency), and after 6 months, these guys still show a lot of juice left.  I could probably get by with going longer between changing them out, but I'm not willing to risk my smoke detector not working when I need it.I love these and will continue to buy the Amazon 9V batteries.

  These 9v batteries work fine, that's not the issue. The issue is that they are a fraction of an inch shorter than Duracell or Energizer 9v batteries, so they don't fit snugly into the battery compartment of Kidde smoke alarms and CO detectors. You'll insert the battery, close the battery door, and it'll still chirp because it's not *quite* big enough to make full contact when seated in the battery tray (it barely touches the terminals, hence the continued chirping). Very frustrating, considering I bought a whole box to replace all the batteries in my entire home's smoke alarm system. Just be aware if you are buying these for your smoke detectors - stick with major brands.

  Seem to be good alkaline batteries for a reasonable price.My only complaint is packaging related. The cardboard box these came in is quite superior to the plastic molded packaging of other 9V cells. Unfortunately though, each individual cell is shrink-wrapped in a thin hard plastic that covers both terminals and is surprisingly difficult to remove completely. Presumably this is to prevent shorting, which I fully support.I was using these in smoke detectors, so I considered simply cutting the entire top of the plastic - but it ended up being just thick enough to prevent installation in my application. So I had to remove all of the wrapping, which took quite some time.

  It was 4:45am on a Saturday and I was rudely awoken from my slumber to the familiar chirping sound of my smoke detector. No cause for concern as there was no fire, but alas, the battery was low, which always occurs at the most inopportune time. I, being somewhat of an adult, went to the drawer of random essentials everyone has in their kitchen and pulled out a brand new 9v Amazon basics battery.

I’m on my third one today it’s been on about10 hours and I can feel the battery is dying. You May get a few in the bunch that last 3 times longer then others. 33 hrs was the longest and it’s been all down hill from there.

Since I have had generally good luck with Amazon Basics products and the price was lower, I decided to try the 8 pack and figured I'd be back in 10 or so months for more. It was July 26th when I got the 8 pack and I used my first one about 3 weeks ago. I just had to change that one out today barely a month after I bought the pack and after only 3 weeks of using it. The box the batteries are in is easy open but the batteries themselves are anything but easy. Each battery is individually shrinkwrapped in tight plastic that was difficult to remove without a knife or scissors. So from just over a month of use, based on my experience, I will be back to buy more batteries in about 3 months. It'll be the 12 pack of Duracell Procells that I buy then. I didn't notice a size difference in  my tens unit and never thought to compare since they fit the compartment but after reading the other reviews, I'd steer clear and go with something else.

  9v batteries are those batteries that just about everything runs off of that you don't realize; most importantly your smoke detectors. When the batteries die in those things it drives my dogs CRAZY with the random little chirps. Rather than just running to the nearby big box store to buy like two, it's handy to have a large collection of them.

  I’m cheap and don’t use batteries for anything that I would bet my life on… just lots of little things like thermometers, flashlights, headlamps, portable music, remote controls and so on so I usually go by reviews and price. I haven’t been disappointed in these and have yet to find a dud and have even found them to be well into the green on my tester after years of being in a drawer. I did stop using alkaline batteries in items that chew through them… like my cordless mouse… but other than that these are a value and no complaints here so they get 5-stars.

  While I like the designs using six “AAAA” batteries as done by a leading “copper-hatted” brand (compared to the plastic cell design of others), it does no good when the spot welds Connecting the cells are substandard. I had one battery so far that was “dead on arrival” so I dissected it to find if it had leaked or otherwise self-discharged.  I found a tab between the cells was not properly spot welded and was not making contact.  While this quality issue is of little importance for non-critical  applications, I was using these for battery-operated smoke detectors. What if a tab pops off randomly after a successful test (poor weld pops due to normal thermal cycling)? Such a simple quality issue could lead to injury/death.At least I now have six AAAA batteries for my pen light!

The plastic inserts which protect the positive and negative terminals on the Duracell are a good addition  that are not on the Amazon Basic batteries. The packaging in a rather awkwardly square box in which the batteries are stacked on top of one another rather than size by side - in other words, more space required for storage.Will probably by the Duracell's when they go on sale again given the differences in the packaging and the plastic terminal protectors.

  I purchased an 8 pack to replace in my 7 smoke detectors. My smoke detectors are all hardwired in and the battery is a backup in my particular detectors. I see several reviews about them failing and while they've only been in for a few days and are back up, I haven't experienced any issues with this yet. I also didn't have any issues with these fitting into my detectors (First Alert brand). Should any issues arise, I'll certainly update the review. One thing to note, however, and this isn't really a negative so much as it was just unexpected, is all of the batteries I received are tightly wrapped individually in plastic wrap, likely to protect them from making contact with one another, so if you have several to use you'll need something small and sharp to unwrap them.

Fire alarms only go off in the middle of the night, all night before a big day at work. Save your career with a few dollars of advance preparation.

",5.0 ,Brian,"Reviewed in the United States January 22, 2019","









  
  
    
  These 9v are really nice and work great. These are my go-to now for 9V batteries. As a bass player, I use a ton of 9V batteries for my active basses and my pedals. I buy a box of these and just keep it in my gig bag. The boxes the batteries come in are really nice and sturdy and make a great way to keep them organized in your bag. Additionally, each battery is individually wrapped in plastic which is great if you want to store them loose. The plastic wrapping also helps you identify a used or new battery in a pinch. Nothing worse than having a pile of batteries and not know which ones are used. Fast delivery from Amazon as well.

    Super hot / overheating batteries!
  
",1.0 ,M. Apicella,"Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2018","









  
  
    
  I recently went to change the batteries in my CO2 & Smoke detectors with these. When I tested the alarms suddenly none were working. I opened them back up to check if the battery wasn't seated properly. They were in properly however the batteries themselves were scorching hot! I immediately removed the batteries from the detectors but they remained extremely hot. Because of the battery issue I had to run out and purchase a new CO2 detector because I was afraid that the heat from the battery may have damaged it. This happened with MULTIPLE batteries from the box. Clearly some sort of defect and a dangerous one at that!

  I purchased this 8-pack of batteries in November of '18, so they're just a bit over a year old. One of my smoke detectors just started to beep so I went to replace the Amazon Basics battery with a new one. I had 5 left of the 8. NONE of them are now any good; none worked in the smoke detector, which I tested with a good battery from another unit. So I will caution any potential buyers: good deal if you plan on using them all quickly... but they don't hold a charge while in storage! Perhaps the new ones are better... I see that they're a different color. Just don't get the white ones. Can I no longer trust any batteries from Amazon??

I bought the batteries on December 2018 and the batteries had a shelf life date of 07/2023. That's approximately a 5 year shelf life. The batteries are good. However, they did not serve my purpose. Smoke alarms are finicky about which batteries will work. Many times the batteries are still good when the smoke alarms signal a low battery condition by chirping. Don't be quick to throw them away. You may use them on other devices.

  First and foremost, we really like the Amazon brand batteries.  I used these batteries in a digital clock and worked just fine.  However, our main reason for buying this set was to use them in our smoke detectors.  In short, they are TOO BIG!  I never realized 9V batteries vary in size until we tried to use these in the smoke detectors.  Please see the pictures.  They are slightly taller and a little wider.  The door on our smoke detectors simply won't close and you don't want to force it.  This is the only reason we purchased this many...so learning has occurred!  We simply don't use them for anything else other than the occasional battery in a digital clock and for that they work fine.  Please keep this in mind when purchasing. Make sure whatever you are putting them into that you have the extra length and width to accommodate a slightly larger battery.

  ***UPDATED 4/29/2018 -- shortly after I wrote this review, I tossed out the entire box. So disgusted, I didn't even want to hassle with sending back for a refund.  TRASH! **  This weekend I received the batteries and a First Alert carbon monoxide alarm.  I bought the 9v for this purpose - and to use in the smoke detectors.  When I managed to wedge in the slot, the connectors did not fit the alert.  I turned it upside down thinking I had installed incorrectly.  No. I was surprised that I had to forcibly push it into the slot, because of the extra width compared to standard 9v batteries. After no more than 20 seconds of this, I took it out and it was warm, which I thought was odd. In the next minute, I could actually smell the chemicals, and touched it again.  It was HOT!  Too hot to hold and, truthfully, I was sure it was building to explode. I put a cup over it until it cooled off. I've never had this kind of a reaction with a battery. Ever. Maybe I just had a bad batch, but once is enough for me.  I then inserted the Eveready which came with the detector. Problem solved.  These are being returned.  I am not a name-brand snob.  Quite happy with the Amazon basics AA & AAA batteries.  **Before I clicked 'submit', I checked the Eveready and tested the alarm.  My furnace died the other day (which is why I wanted the CM alert) and it is 59 degrees in my house.  The battery was just as cold to the touch.  Win.

  I thought these would be a great deal since I have quite a few pedals and active basses that need 9v batteries. Also seeing the amount of star ratings thought I couldn't go wrong. But these things can't seem to keep a charge even when I unplug everything.I've also had the same problem as a bass player who reviewed these batteries. The battery is too tall and fat for tight battery cavities and don't last long enough.  You can see from my attached ***PHOTOS*** that it doesn't even fit in my battery compartment w/o smashing it in and you don't want to do that because it'll bite into the attached wiring.There are more cons for this particular usage than there are positives. They may work great in other applications but I'm going back to buying regular brand batteries for my electronic instrument needs.

  FYI, this review is for the 9 volt batteries. Amazon apparently groups the reviews for all of their battery styles together. I can't really help with that.Batteries were just a tiny bit longer than the ones they were replacing. This was a problem in my carbon monoxide detector... But the battery compartment is finicky to battery size. I imagine this would work fine in most places, so long as the battery compartment isn't too fancy.By my measurements, the AmazonBasics battery is the same size as another heavy duty battery that won't fit in my CO detector. These batteries are 0.6mm longer and 0.6mm wider than a standard duracell battery.My photos attached show some measurements... Which may not be perfect but hey I don't get paid for this:1: The length measurement of an Amazon Basics battery (47.96mm), along side a Duracell (clearly shorter) and another brand ""Heavy Duty"" battery.2: A measurement of the difference in thickness between the Amazon Basics and the Duracell battery. (0.59mm thicker)3: A measurement of the difference in length between the Amazon Basics and the Duracell battery. (0.6mm longer)

  Put these on a 6 month subscribe and save and use them to replace the batteries in your smoke detectors at regular intervals. I got the last batch on November 28 2015 and exactly 2 months later on January 28 2016 the 2am chirps from a smoke detector indicating a low battery went off on one. A day later, a second chirp at 7am on Jan 29 went off. I'm canceling the subscription and going back to a name brand, and replacing the rest of the batteries this weekend.

    Low capacity, smoke detectors lasted a month.

  I used these to replace the 9v batteries in 6 smoke detectors in my house.  Within 5 weeks, all of my smoke detectors are now chirping the low battery warning. Typically, my smoke detectors will last at least 6 months using name brand batteries.  I will not buy these again.  I'm seeing people report low capacity for years now. Amazon really needs to work on the quality of their products' supply chain, as the Amazon Basics line is really hit and miss. These 9volt batteries are a total miss and not worth purchasing.

    Many negative reviews - but seems OK to me.. I measured all voltages...

  I did not read the reviews before purchasing these batteries - and if I had, I would not have purchased them. I bought to install in water leak sensors placed under out sinks and water heater. I tested each water leak sensor and each worked, with these batteries installed. THEN I was going to buy another 8 and saw the reviews. Bummer, I need to check the voltage of each battery so I KNOW the batteries are good. I have just finished doing this, each battery was 9.77V - measured with a very good voltmeter. This is a bit higher than I thought it should be, but OK. I set off an water sensor and let it run for about 45 seconds, that battery read 9.53V after this. Sill fine and more in line with what I thought the batteries should read. I can't vouch for how long they will last, but there is no current being pulled from the battery unless the sensor goes off, so I think I'm ok for a few years, but I plan to test every 6 months or so - easy for me to do as I put Velcro on each sensor so I can remove easily from under the sink, the battery pulls right out, and I can test quickly. The Size is not an issue in the application - but I can see where in other applications it might be. Costco has $3 off the gold top Duracell 5 year guarantee 9V batteries, which brings the price from $16.50 to $13.50, so not much more than these $10 - so I did buy 8 of those to be used ads backups - but if these Amazon batteries work under load (when the siren goes off) I'll be buying more.

  These were bought to put in a our ceiling smoke detectors.  In less than 1 year 1 of the batteries went bad and in the middle of the night we were awakened by the chirp in the detector indicating a need for a battery change.  We got new batteries, but had to go through the expense of having someone come in and change all of them in our 14 ft. ceilings.  We buy allot of items from Amazon and usually don't have problems, but we sure did with this item.
