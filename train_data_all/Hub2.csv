    Another great product from Sabrent
  
",4.0,Kelly Zurp,"Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2017","









  
  
    
  I'm very happy with this hub.  It's nice and small and works just great.  I own a Sabrent USB 3.0 hub as well, and my experience with it caused me to select Sabrent for this purchase, too.I would have given it 5 stars, but for one thing.  The cable is very short, maybe a foot or so, which is great for laptops, but I'm using it on a workstation tower that is located under my desk, so I had to get an extension cable for it.  No biggie, and I wouldn't let that stop you from getting this unit.NOTE:  I was having trouble with my Logitech Unifying Receiver when it was plugged into the back of my tower (poor reception from mouse).  I now have the receiver plugged into my Sabrent hub, which is located on my desk's work surface, and it works great!

  I have been looking for a USB hub for a while and none were the ""bang for the buck"" I thought they should be. I read the reviews and thought I would try this one.It is nice. It works well and I have quickly filled up each port.The disadvantage of this unit is the length of the cord that runs from the hub to the computer. It is VERY short. I use a laptop and this would be really great if the cord was longer and I could then velcro it onto the lid and when using, the hub is out of the way. I can't do that with this unit. That is a big drawback for me and I do mean BIG however, the price was more than fair for four ports.If it had a longer cord, it would be PERFECT

  Looks great and is exactly what I needed. Only reason I gave 4 and not 5 stars is because sometimes the PC won't pick up the device plugged into the hub if you plug it in while the computer is running.  Plug everything you need into the hub and then start your computer to avoid any glitches.  Otherwise it's a great product!

  In regards to the Sabrent 4-port hub with individual power switches and led lights is a great bargain. I have been using it with my lenovo ideapad, if anybody has one you know that there is a lack of usb ports like any other laptop.I've had no problems whatsoever, I attached a magnet from a old hdd so it can attached on the side of my metal cart/desk and not be in the way.

  I really like this product. I use the USB 2.0 hub as an ON-OFF switch for USB LED lights mounted on my pull-out keyboard and for switching between monitoring my two UPS sources. The lighted switches are a nice touch. I use the USB-3 hub to disconnect my two USB 3.0 BACKUP DRIVES, flash drives, and card reader from my computer. That allows me to physically isolate my backup drives and thus better protect them from malware. I receive a notice from my calendar to reconnect the drive prior to my Acronis backup. Acronis 2014 sends an email when the backup is complete, as a reminder to disconnect the backup drives. Knowing that your backups are safe is truly priceless; and this is done with ""remove hardware"" followed by pressing a button.

  Junk. It didn't even last 2 years. It was okay for the first 6 months or so, but then the USB cables that were plugged in would lose contact and weren't working properly.

    Why I wanted 2.0 instead of 3.0 for wireless device dongles.
  
",5.0,Wayne,"Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2021","









  
  
    
  I bought this product because USB 3.0 creates signal interference in the 2.4GHz - 2.5GHz range, which happens to be the frequency that Bluetooth and most wireless mouse and keyboard dongles use. So, if you plug those devices into a USB 3.0 plug, you are likely to get intermittent problems with those devices stuttering or not working. With this USB hub, and a USB extension, I am able to plug my wireless mouse, keyboard and Bluetooth dongles in at a safe distance from the USB 3.0 ports, and alleviate that problem.

  Very convenient USB HUB! Definitely needed it to use my USBs on the desktop computer which doesn't have enough built in ports for me. It's small enough to stay out of my way. The only thing about this Hub is that with the type of USBs that I have, I can only use 2 at a time because my USBs are a little to wide to use all 4 ports. That's the only complaint I have.  For me, the chord is just the right length! Happy with my purchase..the price was excellent......I bought 2!

",5.0,Jimmy B,"Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  Because of my home office / studio setup, I needed USB ports in two locations. I purchased Sabrent’s 3.0 USB hub for my recording gear, webcam and game pads; and their 2.0 USB hub for my bluetooth mouse / keyboard dongle and printer.The 2.0 and 3.0 hubs transfer data exceptionally well - no connectivity issues, lag, or playback issues whatsoever. Having an on/off switch per USB port is incredibly convenient due to the number of instruments and mics I use for recording. Both hubs are the same size - they’re slim / compact and easy to keep out of sight.The Sabrent 2.0 and 3.0 hubs together cost me $17 and transfer data for 8 devices simultaneously without a hitch. Having two separate USB hubs allows me to keep all devices connected to my PC and in their proper place.I couldn’t be happier with these hubs, and highly recommend them!

  The laptop I was issued from work only has one USB port - NOT handy!  So a few months back I ordered a Belkin USB 2.0 4-Port Ultra-Mini Hub by Belkin from Amazon which didn't work very well for me.  The things I had plugged in kept losing connectivity. I thought maybe that's just how good it was going to get since I'd never used a hub before.  However I got so frustrated that several weeks back I came back to Amazon and ordered this Sabrent 4-Port USB 2.0 Hub with Individual Power Switches and LEDs and I can't believe the difference.  I have not once lost connectivity with anything I plug into it. 3 of the 4 hubs are currently being used and I'm loving the fact that I don't have to work in frustration any more.

  I was seeking to find a compact, self-powered hub for travel, as the Macboo0k Air is very limited on USB ports, and I've been pleasantly surprised with this gem. It fits neatly into a pocket in my carry-on bag, fits snugly in the port, and thus far has been completely foolproof with everything I've plugged into it.Turning off and on of individual devices is nice, as well. However, if I were to have one suggestion, it would be for a longer cord on the unit itself. The short cable tends to place the hub in some very awkward positions, especially when using the laptop in clam-shell mode (on a vertical stand). Fantastic little budget port for travel, though... Glad I purchased it!

In fact, for something like a USB HDD, I wouldn't exceed one. They use considerably more power than something like a USB Flash Drive, which I think you could stack on without an issue.I actually bought this for my Raspberry Pi, which is a device where you especially need to be conscious about the power consumption of the devices you plug in. But overall, it's a great item for cheap. The switches are a nice touch, with a nice blue glow. It's easy to control what devices are on, without having to unplug them.

  I love this 4 port hub and it fits my needs to a T.  I hate plugging chargers into the 12 volt plug in the ashtray. My car has an additional 12 volt plug in the boot so I plug this hub in that port and am able to plug my phone and my music usb drive into the port for playback in the car. I haven't found use for the other 2 ports yet but I like the convenience of the flexable cable that's long enough to rest comfortably on the floor of the boot without a bulky cable intruding into storage space.  I only turn on the two needed ports and keep the other two turned off.  It does everything I need it to do and because it is so light weight, I plan to purchase another one for my tablet dock. Most multi port hubs I've purchased would only allow me to use 2 ports at a time but not so with this one. When my friend's phone went dead on one of our out of state shopping trips, we were both able to charge our galaxy phones without any problems or decreased charging capacity.

  I can't believe I never thought of buying one of these before! Between the iPhone charger, fitbit dongle, fitbit charger, external hard drive, and I'm still using wired keyboard and mouse - I was always shuffling things in and out of the two available USB ports on the front of my computer - not anymore!I haven't had any power issues, though I seldom use all of these things at once so maybe if I was syncing and charging my fit bit and iPhone while also working on documents on the external hard drive it would be too much! But after three weeks of having this, I'm just amazed I didn't think of it sooner!

  The connection of the port to my Surface 2 is very finicky.  I have to have the unit positioned perfectly in order for the ports to work.  Strange thing is that once I plug it in I can tell that the ports are receiving power because it lights up, but the ports do not work until I find the perfect position.  At the moment I have it plugged in and sitting on a scotch glass with happens to be the perfect height to give me a good connection.

  I chose the Sabrent 4-Port hub for a couple reasons. Foremost is the size factor. I have a Dell all-in-one 23"" screen and fits well on my portable computer stand. Very little space for extras, which is good as I am a stacker. The Sabrent hub fits perfectly under the monitor making for easy access. The hub is light weight yet with enough heft to let you know this is not something slapped together to make a buck or two.The second reason is price. With USB 3.0 becoming more prominent the 2.0 hubs are getting cheaper in order to clear out inventories. This hub was at my price point and I feel that I made a good and wise purchase.

I have not noticed any power loss, and all our USB powered devices work well with this hub.

  I bought this for the new toshiba laptop I recently purchased. One thing I like about this usb extender. One aspect of this usb extender I like is the fact the usb connection thing is attached to a cord. Other extenders I have had in the past simply have one that folds out. My laptop sits on a mounted fan to keep it cool and to help me work. So, this made it really head to plug it in and allow it to sit on my desk while I work.I didn't know this before, but on top (you can see it in the picture) this usb extender has buttons over each of the ports. You press one of those buttons when you have a usb plugged into it so it activates. A blue light comes on to let you know that port is active. I LOVE that! It's kind of cool since I do have quite a few computer items that tend to light up. So, that added to the little light show I have going on with my laptop.It's pretty fast and transfers data just fine. Perfect for being able to plug a bunch of things in at once.

  Does exactly what it says; it is a USB hub. I haven't really taxed it too hard, but it's flawlessly performed with any number of devices I've connected to it. I've used it with several Windows laptops, a Macbook Pro, and an iMac and never had a problem. It was even supplying wired ethernet for the Macbook through a USB ethernet adapter at the same time I was running a portable hard drive off it.I had a few people go ""where did you get that?!"" since it is immediately apparent what its function is. They're even more shocked when they find it costs less than $10.The indicator LEDs are very bright, so you might not want it active while you're sleeping (bright blue LED light everywhere), but I mostly use it at work anyway and it doesn't cause any problems.

I run a Zebra shipping label printer, commercial HP office printer/scanner, Canon food grade edible ink printer, and a Primera LX2000 color label printer all through this USB splitter.

    A competent USB hub with indiviual power switches for its ports - ideal for connecting simple devices.
  
",4.0,,"Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2016","









  
  
    
  With my ever growing group of devices, I once again found myself in need of a new USB hub.  My needs were simple, I had no intention of connecting a hard drive or anything that would draw a significant amount of power, all I wanted to do was connect multiple input devices like keyboards, trackpads and gamepads.  I came across this Sabrent model with individual on/off switches for each port and liked that idea.This hub is inexpensive and has performed the function for which I needed it very well.  As is often the case, you do get what you pay for so this hub doesn't feel very solidly constructed and the lights above the ports kind of bleed over into adjacent ones and I ran into one minor issue with it where for a time it failed to recognize the trackpad on a keyboard/trackpad combination device.  It has worked flawlessly aside from that one hiccup.One thing to bear in mind if you plan to use this to connect external storage is that it is a USB 2.0 hub, so you will not get the best transfer speeds out of USB 3.0 devices.  Also, as this hub is not powered, you may need to run into some issues depending on the computer or whatever device to which this hub is connected.  I use it primarily on an NVIDIA Shield Android TV and have not run into that issue.  I have also briefly tested it on a couple of computers.If you have a need to connect simple devices without a significant power draw and would like the ability to enable or disable them at the touch of a button, this unit will fit the bill nicely and is easy on the wallet.  If you need a hub for storage devices or other devices that may need to draw more power from the host unit, you'll probably want to look into a powered hub instead.

  For the price, this hub is pretty good. Read and write speeds are really great, but if you move around a lot of data, you wanna look at the USB 3.0 version. The LEDs look very cool and the hub isn't as big as it looks in the pictures. It's 8 cm long and 3 cm wide. DON'T BUY THIS IF YOU WANT TO CHARGE THINGS AS WELL, IT'S A VERY SLOW CHARGER!Update: It's been over two years since I had this product. The product definitely passed the electronics shelf-life test! And for that, I'm tempted to give this product 4 out of 5 stars, but I'm hesitant because of the charging issue. I've tried to test this product with various electronics to see if perhaps it could charge them well. With the iPhone 6s plus, the Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, and even Bose QC20s, the devices just simply refused to be charged by this hub. Read/write speeds are also pretty mediocre. For now, this product serves as a connection hub for my laptop. By this, I mean I've connected a USB Fan (works), a wireless mouse, a wireless keyboard and my printer. I tried to use this hub to transfer files from my laptop to a USB Flashdrive, and found it ineffective and slow and rely on my laptop's USB ports instead.All in all, final recommendation. Buy this product if you're looking for extra ports to connect wireless keyboards/mice, USB Fans, printers or other peripherals. Would 100% not recommend this device for device charging or file tranfers!

  UPDATE:It has been just a few months and I have now begun to experience disconnection problems with this USB hub. It started 2 days ago while trying to import pictures off of an SD card. I used it again a moment ago and had th re some problem while transferring a larger file. By larger I mean about 2 GB. I ended up having to use a different hub to transfer the file. The hub hasn't left our desk. It hasn't been pulled on excessively.  In fact, we have barely used it at all. We got about 6 months of LIGHT use out of this USB hub. I don't know if that would have been less had I been using this particular hub with my portable office.  At this point I can NOT recommend this hub to anyone. Look elsewhere.

  I'm an iMac user. I love the design of the iMac, but hate that the USB ports are all rearward-facing. I figured I could remedy this with a cheap accessory like this Sabrent USB hub, which I purchased and taped with 3M double-sided tape to the underside of the iMac with the ports facing forwards.It works great! I love how you can turn on only the ports you're currently using with the touch of a button. The blue LEDs clearly indicate which slots are active (a minor complaint is that there's no way to turn the LEDs off except by disabling the port, which sucks a little bit and costs the hub 1 star, but wouldn't stop me from purchasing this item again). The transfer speeds are fast via 2.0, and my devices are always recognized in OSX. Perfect compatibility - just the way a USB hub should work. It even provides enough power to charge my iPhone 6/iPad 2.Would recommend. Perfect purchase if a) you're looking to relocate USB ports to the front of your computer or b) you just want to expand your connectivity options.

None of the connections have been questionable after 6 months from buying it and it still works as smoothly as day 1.

The buttons work great and give a satisfying, but small, click and is accompanied by a blue LED to let you know that the port is active. The problem is that the LEDs sort of ""bleed"" through to the next port and makes it confusing to see which one is actually active. Clicking one of the middle buttons would confuse me on if the adjacent buttons were lit or not and was a hassle sometimes.Overall, the device looks great on your desk and is perfect for travel due to it's small size. Just be careful with the small cable and don't give it too much stress. I would definitely buy this again, or even the 3.0 model, for the price, performance, and sleek design.

  I was so excited when I purchased this product thinking it would solve my USB shortage issue! It worked fine for the first hour, then it started disconnecting from my computer automatically, then reconnecting, and disconnecting. This can go on for over a minute if I don’t put a stop to it by yanking the USB out of the port of my laptop. My fear is that with it disconnecting automatically without permission, it will probably mess up the files on my flash drive. I give this 1 star.

  This is the first USB hub I have purchased that does not have a separate power supply.  It works just fine on an old Dell M1330 laptop running Vista and it is much more convenient/ useful.  The wireless mouse and keyboard connect and work just fine running through the hub.  I don't really care about the power switches on each port but since they are there I have turned off the two unused ports.  I don't understand the infatuation the designers (of all electronics) have with the blue lighting.  In a darkened room it is totally annoying.

  Works great. My friend even bought one and his works great too. It does what it says. Gives you 4 ports in the space of one. I love the fact that you can use the switches to individual turn on/off as many ports as you want. It does not come with a power supply so it is drawing power from your computer usb port. With that in mind be careful of what you attached it. If you plug in several power hungry devices (eg a phone, external , tablet, etc) and turn on all of them one time it will overwhelm the system and cause it to shutdown the ports.For regular use with flash drives and lightweight stuff like that it functions very well.

There is an LED blue glow around the buttons/switches which turn on when the corresponding USB port is activated.  The glow disappears when it is switched off.Compatibility: So far, every USB device has connected without any difficulty.  Connection remains strong without disconnecting randomly.Cons:Buttons can easily be pressed.  There is basically no security measure to prevent it from being pressed accidentally.

  This thing doesn't do a fantastic job on its own. USB 1~2 standards dictate that a unit can deliver 100mA of current on average, and up to 500mA of current if the unit sends a request, and the host allows it. Now downstream if you have no power for your USB hub, you can only deliver 100mA per USB slot. So if your devices are not playing nice you may have dropouts in the USB Hub. Adding a power supply would fix this, but the power jack on the side appears to be non-standard. If you want a USB hub, I suggest spending a bit more and finding one that is powered. You will have fewer problems.

If I want to connect or disconnect a drive, I just select the associated button and press it. I do not have to keep removing and reinserting the drives unless I need to carry them on a trip. The buttons are distanced enough for who with fat fingers.I might have one concern that the on/off switch is a little too soft to toggle. I have a cat which uses to hang around my laptop. I am afraid some day she is curious enough to tap on the blue light (button) while the device is in use. That might cause damage to files being written.

  I actually like this hub. It's nice to be able to turn the power on or off to each individual device that I'm charging. That comes in handy as the USB from my computer seems to not be able to support more than 1 maybe 2 of them being turned on without locking up the laptop. When I say ""locking up"" I mean that the mouse (also USB device plugged into another port) quits working until you shut off one of the charging ports on the hub.Is this the device's fault? I can't be sure if it's my computer or if it's because of the device. However, on the information provided from the seller there is no mention of this as a possibility to be aware of.The cord is very short and just barely long enough to put the port behind the laptop instead of having it sit on the keyboard.Perhaps a better solution would be to charge a battery pack and attach the hub to that pack to charge multiple devices?

Initially that seemed to do the trick, but then later I saw suggested items including versions of this very USB hub, except by maybe 2 or 3 different companies. Then my wheels started turning. I looked at the reviews for them and saw an issue come up again and again in the reviews. People using those hubs had trouble transferring large files to/from external storage (thumb drives, external hard drives, etc). So I did an experiment. I plugged the new wifi into this hub, plugged the old wifi directly into the computer, and ran a continuous ping with each (one at a time, not both at once). Sure enough, the new one gave results that look like the photo, and the old one was smooth sailing, not a single return slower than 25ms. So clearly this hub was the culprit. I didn't seem to have this problem when I got it in March, and it started acting up in mid July. I'd give this 2 stars but people aren't going to buy a hub unless they're going to be transferring data (wifi, HD, flash keychain, etc) and even at this price range that's not something you want to have working when it feels like it.

  My first USB hub and it is working out great. A very useful product and really comes in handy with all the electronics around these days, and saves wear on those USB ports. I should not have waited so long to get one but I am a procrastinator. I only have two ports on the front of my  desktop computer and one of those is worn out and plugging into the  back is too out of the way for me to deal with.Since purchasing this hub and plugging in to my computer it has really been a lot easier for me to keep things charged and ready when I want them it. I am a slow adapter to technology but in the past year I have  started to gain some ground, getting several portable items that need  charging quite often. My computer is a Window 8.1 and this hub works  with it.I love that there are light indicators to turn on and off the individual ports. I hope that I have helped you decide if you would like this product, it is working great for me. I used it to upload the pictures from my camera. Purchased this item from Store4PC.

  I like this Hub for what it's suppose to do... connect other peripherals. I liked the buttons to turn ON/OFF the individual ports, but I don't think it was necessary after using it a few times. For one, I kept forgetting to push it ON. Which made me wonder why I couldn't see my external HD, DOH!! So most of the time I just leave it in the ON position. So far it has been doing well for the last month. Just had issues with just using it as a multiple charging port when plugged into a wall socket for phone and iPad, it charged only one at a time at a slow rate. Also the cord is very short, another foot would have been useful.

  This product seemed like the best way to extend my 4 built in USB ports; however upon arrival I discovered it one of the buttons was already depressed, so no I have to push it down below the case to turn it off (fortunately  it still turns on and off) and in general due to the poor quality I am constantly nervous the buttons will break as they feel like they are always there right out of the case. all that aside, leaving them on, and just letting it sit and due its job; that it does just fine. If you plan to use the on/off feature, not the item to buy; if you want something cheep you can turn on and leave; but not planning on moving or taking are abuse then this might be okay.  I should note, that I have tried 3 other brands with a range of results; in the case of these style items, you get what you pay for and you will need to spend some money if you want something reasonably sized ( this is a very small item) which will take any wear and tear as it where.

  This is a really convenient little hub. It takes very little room, the cord is not so short that it's frustrating to actually use, and the small LED's are a pleasant shade of blue. The off/on feature of each port light is a nice touch. It seems sturdy and well made.It's always good to have a hub or two handy.

  although this was ordered by mistake (I actually needed an HDMI hub), at this low price, I decided to keep it.  With both back USB ports in use on my small no-physical-drive PC, I was able to use this hub in one of the front ones.  With this hub, I was able to plug in a portable CD-ROM drive, two flash drives and a portable hard drive.  And the real beauty is each port has its own on-off switch, so I can access each one as I need it.  The blue LED lights around each power button easily tells one which ports are active.I have seen higher prices for hubs that have none of these handy features.  And it doesn't require external power like some hubs do.

  I somehow broke the switch that turns my WiFi on and off for my Sony laptop.  Of course it was somehow in the off position and the local repair shop could not get it turned ""on"".  They offered me a USB wireless device to connect to my WiFi at home for a lowered price of something close to $50.  The reduced price was because they had tried to fix the switch.  I immediately thought of Amazon and ordered this to go with the wireless USB adapter since I only have 2 built-in USB ports and use one for a wireless mouse.  Received this quickly and plugged it in and was up and running.  I wish the attached cord was either longer, or the device was someway attachable to the laptop to make it more streamline.

    Worst Camera Ever, But Has Other Uses
  
",5.0,Matthew Steele,"Reviewed in the United States July 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  For some reason, Amazon's automated system seems to expect me to review this as a Camera. I can safely say that, while this is a highly effective 4-port USB charger, it fails in every respect as a camera.Looking at Amazon's feature list, the first thing it wants me rating is camera quality. I'm afraid I have to give this only a single star. If I could, I would give it even less. Forget megapixels, I was unable to use this alleged camera to get even a SINGLE pixel onscreen. I really have to question the decision-making of the manufacturer, seeing as they decided to forgo camera quality in favor of accessory features, like four LED USB ports which light up when charging, and thus allow me to easily manage power output to multiple devices.I must give it a 1 in charge power as well. While it has proven itself exceedingly useful when it comes to charging OTHER devices, such as my tablet PC, Phone, XBox One controller, and wireless mouse, it does not keep a charge for even a single second. Had I been expected to rate its capabilities at charging other objects, I would of course have given it a five star, the blue LED lights take minimal power and allow me to choose between putting almost all of the charge power into my charging device when I go out for a walk, or having several devices plugged in at a time.My laptop's USB ports are largely broken, and there's only one of them. This USB hub allows me to plug in an extra keyboard and mouse, because the shoddy quality of the Alienware keyboard the laptop came with meant that its keys have largely fallen off. I have had no choice but to find a USB hub, such as this one, when it comes to charging. I've used several brands of USB hub, and this is absolutely the best one I can find.I have, thus, given it TWO stars for cable length. Its cable is actually slightly larger than normal for USB hubs, meaning I don't need to worry as much about bumping it when I move my hands around the desk. It's really quite generous in that respect. However, even long for a USB hub is very short for a camera, which somehow the algorithm believes this is. As a camera, the charge cable is far too small. Once again, however, you need not worry, because it won't actually keep its charge anyway.I'm sorry to say that I am cannot in good conscience approve of the camera I was provided. However, since the page I bought it was labeled a USB extender port, and it is 100% the best one of those I have ever seen, sturdier than most, sticking effectively in the port on my laptop that most other things jiggle out of, that's not really that much of a disappointment.If you are looking for a digital camera, look elsewhere. This is not a digital camera. However, if you want a USB port, I cannot possibly recommend it highly enough. This is a miracle, and if it ever breaks just from overuse from how much I am carrying it around and such, I fully intend to replace it with another of the same brand. You can't get a better 4-port USB port, a fact which, I hope, will somewhat soften the blow to anyone who expected a camera.Five stars to the product, and one star to whatever idiot made Amazon's product recognition algorithms.

  I use my Asus laptop as my primary ""desktop"" computer as well as a laptop, and unfortunately, the 3 included USB ports were not enough, or in good locations for stationary work. After a few months of use, I can safely say this product was a bargain for what it does. It is not powered, so you cannot use this to charge USB devices, but the four USB 2.0 ports are very well suited for most accessories. I saw no need to spend more money for a USB 3.0 hub when all I needed to hook up were a Keyboard, mouse, and occasionally a flash drive for small file transfers. I could use the 3.0 ports on my laptop itself if I needed the extra speed (though 2.0 is fine for most). The build quality on this hub is second to none, and I like that I can deactivate the ports when they are unused. The cable is thin and flexible so I can position this hub as I need it. I would highly recommend this hub and other Sabrent products. I also purchased a SATA III Hard Drive USB enclosure for my laptop's old hard drive when I swapped it out for an SSD. Again, a fantastic product of very high quality that will last for years.

It works well for connecting my phone to the laptop, I keep my mouse plugged in full time and rarely have an issues with it, and the on and off option allows me to not worry if I keep a cord in that the cord or the laptop will be damaged.  I do wish the cord was a bit longer, but honestly I haven't found many of the USB hubs with long cords, and this is the longest one of the lot.  My Kindle does keep tell me low-charge, but not sure if that's the hub or my computer.  My phone has said it twice since obtaining it.  Otherwise it's quite happy with it.  I'm happy too. :)

  I have had this for about a year now and have only occasionally had problems with it, but they are worth mentioning.Pros:Buttons to turn ports on and off is nice. In retrospect, this isn't as useful as I thought it would be, but it is still I fairly nice feature. It is just really not that often that I have something plugged in and I don't want to use it.Small and compactCons:The cable for this is insanely small. To make this product worthwhile I also bought an AmazonBasics USB Extension Cable. I have the entire hub set up on the top corner of my desk but wired down to the back of my computer. I can see how many people would not need an extension cable, however, if they are just setting this up on a laptop or have a spare port on a keyboard.Anything related to audio doesn't really work with this hub. My headset / USB Speakers or small things like that always end up receiving an annoying hum as feedback when plugged in here but work totally fine if plugged in anywhere else on my computer. Work around this hasn't been a problem for me, but if you need this hub to have more space for headset or other audio equipment, I would look for a different product.

  Bought the one in the photo December 2018. It's now July 2020 and I need to purchase a new one. I believe there may have been a power surge that caused two of my computer items to die. One was my laptop charging battery and the other was this USB port extender. I was surprised with how long and how well this USB port extender worked. I've used others that did not connect to my computer or gadgets. this works, buy it! I'm upgrading to the 10 port extender because I like it so much and because my computer is about 3 years old and only 2 of 3 of the USB ports on it are working.I can't speak for the 10 port yet, but if you are considering the 4 port USB extender, BUY IT :) I've used this for my mouse/keyboard, printer, scanner, to charge my phone and watch, and to open flash drives.

  Couldn't get this USB 2.0 hub to even work. My PL recognized it just fine, but the moment you plug a device in and then hit the switch to send power to that port, and the hub resets itself over and over never allowing the PC to recognize the device or load the device drivers. Instead all you hear is the PC sound saying a device was plugged in, then start loading drivers but at that second chiming that the device was unplugged and it cycles bock and forth plugging in and unplugging. I'd return it but only paid $3 or $4 and the return postage would cost more than the refund. Avoid!

",2.0,RobertaMc,"Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2016","









  
  
    
  I was given this hub by a friend who bought it from Amazon for me. It's maybe nine months old (in my possession), and today it has simply stopped working. It's plugged in, as always, but I leave the ports off unless I am using the devices plugged into it. Now not one of the blue lights comes on when any of the four buttons is depressed.I just don't know enough about the technology to guess at why it has stopped working. Usually things with moving parts are most susceptible to breakdowns, but except for the buttons that activate and deactivate the ports, nothing else moves or has changed since I hooked this up. I have had a couple of power outages recently, but they have occurred when my Mac has been asleep. Perhaps there have been surges, but none of my other equipment has had problems.I'll be buying a new hub, but I won't be buying another one of these, even though it's Amazon's favorite.

",1.0,Librarijen,"Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2019","









  
  
    
  I was so excited to get this USB expander/splitter.  My plan was to use this to charge multiple devices from one USB.  I plugged in my phone and my tablet, and was very disappointed. The tablet shows that the charger is plugged in, but there is a red ""X"" over the battery icon, indicating that it is not actually charging.  I tested that cord plugged directly into the original USB (the one that this new 4-port charger was plugged into)  and it works fine.  My phone gave me the message that it was ""slow charging"" and that I should check to see if it was plugged in properly.  I checked to make sure all of the connections were good, and went off to take a shower.  When I came back, my battery had DECREASED by 2%!!  I then checked that cord the same as I did the other cord, and sure enough, it works just fine.Thankfully, it was only $8, because I'd already thrown away the packaging, and I'm not sure it will be worth the time and effort of a return.Unfortunately, this device will not work for me for the purpose I intended. :(

  Original product got lost in shipping (currently says it's in Memphis TN???). I blame that on USPS though... Amazon cancelled that order for me, refunded me the money, and after I re-placed the order, they upgraded my shipping to overnight at no charge... so the package did get here with no major issues at all. It's super easy to unpackage, plug it in, switch on the buttons for the ports you are using, and it works. Really nothing to it, just a great little compact item if you have a lack of USB ports on your computer for your peripherals. For the price, it's hard to beat. I have not noticed any speed or download issues with this product (I am using two ports, one for a printer and one for an external Hard Drive). I even like the blue lights!

  Great USB hub! A great price and it works great, although I've only been using it with my Raspberry Pi Zero for RetroPie gaming. I've noticed that this hub is one of the few that is able to power all of the ports when used with the Zero board. Other hubs don't distribute enough power evenly through all the ports at the same time. This one is great, and I especially love the option to turn off individual ports with a simple button. And, the LED light around the button makes it easy to know which ports are powered and which ones are off. I can't recommend this enough, especially for those in the Rasp Pi community!

  EXACTLY AS DESCRIBED!!! I was desperate for something like this - my laptop only has 3 USB ports, and 2 are permanently spoken for. There are times when I needed to have more USB ports because of my devices that need to be connected via USB to my laptop. This works great. Just plug into laptop USB and plug into it whatever you need. And you don't have to keep connecting and disconnecting - you can turn the USB off with the switch (LED light indicates on/off). And if you need more than a 4 port, you can get another 4 port and connect it to this one (according to the package). When you have everything turned off, you don't need to eject USB on the laptop because it only reads what is turned on.I highly recommend this product.**UPDATE 9/15/2014**I ordered another one because with all the products I'm getting that require a USB port (wired keyboard, USB LED light, etc), I just needed another. Took it right out of the packaging, plugged it in....and it works. It works connected to the laptop directly, and it also works connected to another 4-port Hub that's connected to the laptop.I know some people will wonder why I bothered getting a wired keyboard that would require a USB port (because my laptop key pads are acting up, and I don't want to worry about battery life with a wireless), but all in all, I'm happy with my first and second Sabrent 4-Port USB Hub.Fast delivery, and I've had no problems with it.

  Most things being USB driven these days, my laptop and two older towers are always in need of ""just one more"" USB port.This gizmo is ideal, not only can you attach additional devices, but you can turn any on or off in any combination, and the blue LED helps keep it all straight. If you, like me, have a bunch of USB memory sticks, chips and adapters each with a copy of ""something"" and want to get it all consolidated on one machine, this helps. I have a dozen or more microSD chips for smart phones, mp3 players, even bluetooth speakers that accept a chip with mp3 tunes, digital camers... you get the idea.It's also a bargain accessory. Works very well, recommended.

  Junk. I tried using it for two months but found it to be very unreliable. Sometimes the ports worked, sometimes not. For instance, if I ever disconnected my laptop and took it in the other room, then returned and hooked the external keyboard back up to the laptop through this port, it wouldn't work until I restarted the laptop. Countless other similar situations and it got to the point where I just unhooked it because it would make me so frustrated at times. I basically burned $6.99 for nothing.Bottomline, if you like a device that works half the time, this is for you

  This little charger works great for charging general USB devices (like hand warmers, lanterns, toys, etc) however it does not charge my iphone (it must not be mac compatible). So many things have replaced batteries with USB charging cords that I needed something to charge multiple things at once and this seemed to be the answer. It does take a bit longer than I would have liked but overall it serves its purpose for now. I can't decide if the on/off button for each port is useful since sometimes I plug in the device and do not turn ON so I go get my device later expecting it to be already charged and nothing, because I forgot to push the little ON button.

  This review is for the Sabrent 4-Port USB 2.0 Hub with Individual LED lit Power Switches (HB-UMLS).So look carefully, it is USB 2.0 not 3.0, so if you need speed, forget it. But it's perfect for my use case, where I have multiple wireless dongles for keyboards and mice that I attach to the hub. It's nice to be able to switch them on/off individually and the hub lets me quickly switch from using one computer to another. And at least when I bought it, it was cheaper than other options.

  With newer laptops coming with less and less usb ports, this hub is essential. I have a laptop where the usb ports are so close together you can't stick two usb sticks in next to each other. There are four ports on this hub which can be ""turned on"" by clicking each of the little buttons above it. I use it to keep the receivers for my wireless keyboard and mouse that I only use at work and at the end of the day I just remove the hub and keep it in my desk- no more searching for your receivers that you accidentally took out at home. The cord length is about 9 inches, so more than enough to clear whatever else you may have plugged into your computer. The hub itself is very light so you can leave it hanging off your computer.

  Small enough to stash in a laptop bag or conceal in a PC build.  The latter is actually why I bought this hub: to use with a few wireless dongles to add concealed Bluetooth and Logitech Unifying to my gaming PC.  Combined with the NZXT IU01 internal USB hub, this Sabrent hub works well with the aforesaid dongles and works with any OS.  I took a couple of Command strips and stuck it to the front of my case (NZXT H440) behind the vanity shroud and ran the wire inside through a conveniently placed hole to plug it into the IU01 board.  That's it: that's all it takes.  Now I get built-in Bluetooth and Unifying with essentially no signal loss.  I like the individual power buttons -- I can disable the ports I don't need, hopefully reducing overall power draw.Probably far enough off the spec sheets to confuse the guys (and gals) at Sabrent, but I like it. :-)

  Very nice product. I love the LED indicators and the push buttons to turn a port on or off. The cord is very short but I just got an extension cord and have no problems with it. This is an excellent purchase for the price I was planning on upgrading to a larger hub later on, but I've had this one for 6 months now and I'm so happy with it I am thinking about just buying another and pocketing the $40 I'll save for not buying a 7 or 10 port hub. $14 for two of these and $50-$60 for a decent quality 7 or 10 port hub. I currently have a keyboard, mouse, webcam, and flash drive plugged in to this and they all function perfectly.Pros:LEDs turn on when a port is on and are off when a port is off. They work perfectly.The ports are spaced far enough that devices shouldn't have problems when plugged in adjacently.Very small and unobtrusive.Cons:Cord is short (you can see this in the picture though... You get what you see).Overall this is a great product and I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.Note: My WD MyBook external 2TB hard drive won't work using these ports. However, it's a finnicky drive at best and I never know whether a port will read it or not. I haven't tried these with any other external drives.

  Very useful for adding more usb's to a laptop. I use one for a mouse and two for an external hard drive. What's really nice about this product is that you can disconnect a device without unplugging it, thus decreasing the stress on your device. Plugging in and unplugging in a device is bound to put some wear on it and this product allows you to avoid this problem. However, I don't like the aesthetics. The product is advertised as having a ""Sleek black finish"" but it's nothing impressive. It looks like regular plastic that kid's toys are made of. Also, the 2"" cable is inflexible, so you can't bend it to whatever you want.

Furthermore, when I replaced it with an ""Amazon basics"" 4-part unpowered hub a few days ago, I stopped having any issues.

Note:  the external DVR drives used with Dish Network [MUST] have their own power supply - so, I also bought a power-strip for transformers (the transformers are turned 90-degrees, and there's a surge-suppressor), which allows all FOUR (4) external drives to remain powered-up.

    A Sad Story Made Happy by Andrew at Sabrent Support
  
",5.0,Caerbannog,"Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2015","









  
  
    
  This hub is a piece of junk.  I connected devices to it that didn't require bus powering and these devices would constantly disconnect from my system.  I can't sustain a successful connection with any of my devices and my computer using this hub.  I wish I had never purchased it.  It is super cheap, and you get what you pay for.  Too cheap for me to bother returning it.  Bummer.[UPDATE Sept 7, 2015]  Andrew from Sabrent contacted me (on his own initiative, I might add - and solely because he saw this Amazon review) and followed up by sending out a replacement unit to me, including an AC adapter (which wasn't even part of my initial purchase).  The replacement USB hub works just fine.  Thanks very much Andrew!  Also, to clarify, attached to the older (failed) unit was in the simplest scenario of just one device - a PNY USB flash thumb drive which draws very little current - and even with just that one device the drive would erratically attach and detach constantly (while it was plugged in) which made it basically impossible to access the thumb drive in any reliable way.  This doesn't happen with the new hub - it maintains the connection (so far).So I have to say that I'm very impressed with Sabrent's proactive support.  It's unusual, and speaks highly of them.  Given this experience, I would purchase future products from Sabrent.

  My previous hub, an Insignia unit, stopped working after may be two years of using it to hook regular USB keyboard/mouse to my laptop.Found this Sabrent unit in Amazon, as having a ton of favorable reviews, almost five stars rating, costing less than ten bucks, featuring four ports with individual on/off switches, so it was a no brainer to pick this one.So far, highly satisfied about it. Now, besides hooking my keyboard/mouse, I also use it as the charging station for my phone - of course, my laptop is always plugged into the wall.The cord length  is just what is needed for it to sit comfortably over my laptop left ""cheek"". A longest cord would defeat the purpose of being also a tool to help diminish cable cluttering, not the opposite.

  Did they really have to make it so small? I bought it with the only purpose - to be able to connect 4 thumb drives to my TV. The plan was to save my fitness videos by category to 4 separate USB flash drives and switch between them as needed. This would enable me to overcome the limitations ob the built-in player in my TV (it can see only a small number of files on a drive). Guess what? The distance between the 4 connectors is so short that USB sticks do not fit next to each other. One can only plug in 4 USB cables, but not 4 USB drives.  A couple extra millimeters between the ports would've sold this problem. Now, I have to buy short extension cables to be able to achieve my goal. Why not do it right from the very beginning?Otherwise, the price is good and it is good that a hub with switches is available.

  I purchased this 4-Port USB 2.0 Hub with Individual Power Switches & LEDs (Black) almost two years ago and it still works great. Others have mentioned in their reviews that they ran into some issues with it disconnecting their external hard drives while in use. Fortunately, I can say that although I have had this happened to me before with this device, it has only happened once or twice in the whole time I've had it. The one or two times it has disconnected or improperly ejected my drive was when I either plugged or unplugged something else into the 4-Port Hub (I believe it was during a transfer, so it seems that the connection was disrupted from the additional source added or being taken away), or when I turned pressed or depressed one of the buttons to cut power to that USB port.Because I cited either of these activities as disrupting the connection to my external drive, I just do not mess with the on/off port buttons or plug/unplug anything during a transfer just as a precaution. (Note: the drive does not disconnect every single time that things are plugged/unplugged or the button for a port is pushed, I can usually use it like normal even when my external is connected. The drive has only disconnected due to this activity those very few times mentioned).I like the ability to ""turn off"" the connection to specific ports by using the buttons so certain drives though ejected are ""unplugged.""I have a MacBook Pro so having additional USB ports was a must with only two available on my computer. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend. The price is extremely good too considering the use I've gotten out of it thus far.

  Originally I thought that this was a gimmick hub; however it turned out to be very useful. I purchased this to use in my car in order to power a Bluetooth receiver for streamed Internet audio. However I also wanted a second port to recharge my Samsung S4 smartphone. And this hub just turned up at the bargain end of the price spectrum.So I tossed it in the center console, thinking ""done"". As it turned out running the Bluetooth receiver made my phone fail to work with the car's integrated Bluetooth for incoming calls. So now it's as easy as reaching inside the console to power down the receiver with a button if I expect a call while I'm driving. And of course I can power it back up when I want to listen to Internet radio. Result is less wear and tear on USB connections, and it is also a lot faster to push a button than to unplug cables.

",5.0,Richard M. Schiller,"Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2013","









  
  
    
  Someone commented on a switch being improper disconnect, but proper Plug nPlay devices wont get improper plug warnings. If you unplug and the drive wasnt ready, youre safer to plug the same item back in; the danger is to plug a different directory into that same port, and then from RAM it writes the former directory onto the new different drive. Computers have only so much memory for directories, and once they max, they will drop a drive from your hub to load the next drive up of your hub. I learned this with a ten port USB hub. This maxing the directory memory of your computer will crash one directory to load up the next directory. And in my case twice i lost a WD Passport Tera drive permanantly because of too much directory Gigs. (Yes, i did swap a drive, and it tried to claim the new drive was the former one plugged in.) So the push-button off is a must for safely having four Tera drives connected. The off-on buttons is a must for USB hubs. WAIT until you hear the computer beep of USB connect or USB drop. I wont buy a USB hub anymore without switches. They were formerly expensive and i was being tight and cheap. I wont buy a switchless ten hub anymore, anybody want mine for free?

  I really like this switch.  It has an input for a power adapter, which I supplied. (There seems to be some confusion about this is the Q&A answers.)  It allows me to power or unpower individual devices (e.g., my Arduino processors, backup disk drives) as desired, without plugging/unplugging USB cables.  I can also charge my phone or GPS, or whatever with it.The paragraph above is actually from my review of the USB2.0 version of this hub.  I liked it so well I ordered the 3.0 version (with power supply) for my new machine with USB 3.0 ports.  I now have it plugged into my Dynadoc U3.0 docking station so I can leave a couple of HDDs and a flash drive plugged in and take them on- or off-line using the appropriate switch if  I don't forget to eject them first :-)I initially had two problems: 1. I didn't plug the power supply into my power strip - the hub will drive flash drives, but won't supply enough power to handle a disk drive.  It easily handled two HDDs when I plugged in the power supply.  Duh.2. At one point, I ejected all (3) devices on the hub (a flash drive and 2 HDDs), turned off the corresponding switches, then tried to bring one of the devices back on line by turning on it's switch.  The computer didn't recognize the presence of the device.  I managed to clear this condition by unplugging the huib from the docking station, and reinserting it.  After this, each device would come up, and I could eject them all (and power them down), and could bring them online again by pushing the appropriate switch.  I haven't seen the problem since.

  I haven't had any problems with pushing the buttons and having hard drives pop off the computer. Of course, I'm only pressing the buttons to  connect the drives. I unmount them first before pressing a switch to disconnect them. As a precaution, however, I don't ever touch any buttons if I'm doing something that is using a hard drive. Just good practice.With that said, this -- and similar -- FOUR port units are the largest I have ever gotten to work consistently at 2.0 speeds. I've tried 7 ports and 10 ports and nada. It seems like FOUR is the magical limit, especially for hooking up hard drives. You won't go wrong with this and you probably will with the larger ones. If you need more ports you might get by with two of these and plugging one of them into one of the vacant ports of the other giving you a total of SEVEN ports with one hookup tot the computer, but I haven't tried this. A better plan would be to get EIGHT ports by hooking each box to a separate USB port on your computer.The switches have a nice blue glow around them when active and pressing them drops the button height a tiny amount as well when in the ""ON"" position. The glowing light is really needed if it's dark to tell what's on and what's not. I like mine so far.

Also, somehow the computer detects that a device has been added when the cable touches the port on the hub, even if the port is turned off.

  We have all been there, standing in the aisles of the place where you are supposed to find the best of buys, staring at the glorious peg hooks filled with USB hubs ranging from $15 and all all the up to $100 plus. I was literally there when I decided to pull out my phone and check Amazon for the same thing I was looking at (not exact same brand but same device) and found this little gem. The first thing you should notice is the size of the chord that connects the hub to the usb on your pc or laptop. Notice it looks nice and long. I didn't get out a tape measure but my guess is at least a foot long. The one is the other mentioned store for twice the price was about 2 inches maybe. Doesn't sound like an issue until you go to plug 4 chords into it. The nice long chord on this one gives you plenty of room to set it on something rather that just leave it hang from your desktop or crowd your lap top so much you cant move it. It is fast as well, takes about 7 seconds for windows to recognize the device once you hit the power button. Which by the way is a really nice feature. A file gets locked and you need to disconnect and reconnect quickly it is literally a push of a button. All and all this is a great little usb hub and I am very happy with my purchase.

  If you are looking to connet/sync multiple devices to a laptop, desktop or other device with limited USB ports, this will allow you to do.  I like the switches that allow you to turn on/off each port.  If you are looking for something that will also allow simultaneous charging, you need to look for something else.  In fact this will accelerate batter drain on cell phones and other battery operated devices.

  This hub does everything it says it will do.Never the less, I wish I had spent more.  I'd like a hub with about 8 ports, with an external power supply so I can plug in my Fire HD7 for file transfers without getting an error message saying that charging will be slow, or perhaps not happen at all.The switches allow one to turn off individual ports.  They definitely work.  In fact, they work too well.  I sometimes bump the buttons are turn off my keyboard or my mouse, or whatever, and it takes me an annoying long time to figure out what's wrong.  You may be smarter than I am.  There are lights, but my hub is in a place that's hard to see and hard to reach.

  Not only does this USB hub come with a small extension to leave you with more room to work, but you can control which USB ports are active with individual buttons.  As this is not a powered USB port (it does not need to be plugged into a wall outlet) make sure you don't try to use devices that will draw a ton of power or it will not get enough power from the single USB socket for all of them.  This is a limitation of using an unpowered USB hub and not of this one in particular.  I would gladly trade that for the convenience of not having to plug it in though.  Any of my high-power devices can use one of the other free USB ports of my machines.  Works fine with 4 USB controllers simultaneously.

  This product works just fine and I've had not problems with it after and extended period of time.  One thing to be aware of, is that if you push a button to make the connection live, you have to push it again to kill the connection.  I thought that when you pushed another button the live button would pop up and no longer be live.  It was important to my application to have full juice at the live connection, but if you don't give the button a second push it stays active and you end up sharing the current with more that one port.The above is a minor inconvenience for what is otherwise a fine product.

  I've only had it for a couple days, so I don't have time with it to say to much about it. But I used it to plug in a wireless mouse, an external hard drive, and a Wi-Fi antenna, and had no problems.  Individual on-off switches are definitely a nice feature, and they are lit up to let you know which one is active. As far as the complaints with power drops, when adding another device, I don't doubt that is happening, because it's using whatever power source such as your USB port from your computer. I haven't had a problem yet.  It doesn't have an external source for power. Most of the big dollar USB hubs, have an external power cord. If you are going to run multiple external hard drives, then you should get one of those instead.Also some of the complaints about the size being small, and the short cord, I'm using this for a laptop, and my iPad. I think that is what is designed for. I think it is designed to be small, easily portable, and low-power consumption.  I say using common sense, if you need something with more power, then get something else, but otherwise this will just do fine. Especially for small portable jobs.

  it works, but if there are multiple signals going through it, you can notice a performance issue.

The issue I had was that when I would use it to program one device while an oscilloscope was running, it would kick me out of my oscilloscope and I would have to restart the program.

  My wife and I both have offices with sit-down desks and stand-up treadmill desks, and we move between them regularly throughout the day. Moving was a pain, even with laptops, because we had to disconnect/reconnect so much gear.To remove the obstacles from using our stand-up desks, I duplicated our primary peripherals (monitor, mouse, keyboard, speakerphone, camera) at both locations, with the USB devices being plugged into a hub at each location. I then ran a single USB cable to each location, and plugged those two cables into this switch.Now, if I move to my treadmill desk I simply turn off the port that connects to the hub at my sit down desk, and turn on the port that connects to the hub on my stand-up desk. It takes about 30 seconds for all the devices to be re-recognized when I do this.All my applications (Lync, Webex, Windows, etc) automatically switch to the 'new' devices without any manual intervention, at least they do after the initial setups (one setup for each USB hub when it is first activated).Separately, I use a VGA splitter to push video to both monitors simultaneously.Now I have no excuse for not switching to my treadmill desk, other than entropy.

  I'm a trainer and travel with several USB devices that I use during my training, including a barcode scanner, external number keypad, and others.  My laptop only has a couple of ports.  I bought this to use when I travel, and it worked beautifully.  All the devices I use connected without issue.  It's small enough to easily fit just about anywhere.  I like that I can turn on the ports individually too.

  This hub feels cheap and the cord is only 10"" long which leaves it hanging since I work with my laptop on a stand. It doesn't fall out so I don't mind that as much. One of the ports is difficult to plug into and those blue lights are distractingly bright (then again I am very sensitive to lights in my face). So I unplug it often or else I'm completely distracted by it like a squirrel in the headlights.It's black, has 4 ports and each port has its own on/off button. It's not very pretty, but it's handy, inexpensive, and it works.

  This device lasted 3 months, 14 days (or barely over 100). The ""A to Z Guarantee"" expired Nov. 8--the hub stopped working around Nov. 23 (Thanksgiving).

  With a Mac Mini you're limited to only 4 USB ports, so I needed a hub for expandability.  This one works great.  Only reason for 4 stars is it's super lightweight, so it slides around a bit under the load of the extra cords. Going to have to try the mounting tape another reviewer suggested. (I hadn't even thought of that.)I find that the Mac Mini does tell me from time to time that one of the devices plugged in (mainly using it for external hard drives & backup) that it has not ejected properly, but it's no big deal, especially when they recommend you plug in external devices like hard drives directly into the USB ports on the Mac Mini.  Definitely recommend.Update: I've had this little gem for nearly 3 years now, and it's still going strong! The only problem is I need to order another one for all the extra gadgets I keep getting! Would love to see a stackable version.

  I didn't really buy this to charge stuff. I bought it so I could manage devices that stay on after you turn off the computer. And for that, it is excellent. The buttons feel great and they only glow when they are on. This tells you exactly what is receiving power and what isn't. My only complaint is that the cable is a little too short by like a foot.

When I want to use my laptop speaker I just turn off that port instead of unplugging the headset.  Same with Camera. I turn off the camera when I am not using it and turn on the camera usb port when I need it. I used to convert the camera but now can just use this instead.  The quality of product looks good.

I guess they know that they are selling junk and as long as it's over the limited warranty date, they will simply not help you out.They could easily make it right, but sending me a replacement, so I can continue with the goal of why I purchased this device in the first place, but they rather just ignore that -- I guess they don't want to grow their repeat customer base.Now I gotta buy something else to replace it, since I now have only a useless paperweight on my desk.So if I were you, I'd get something else, the device will fail to work and the company will refuse to stand behind their product.

  Works as advertised.  Bargain price. I even bought 2 more of these units after trying out the 1st one.There is one thing I would like to suggest however: I would much prefer to have a detachable USB cord than one which is permanently attached.  This would enable me to:1.) replace the short cord with a longer cord so it will work better with my PC setup2.) replace a defective cord.  As it is now, if the cord goes bad, the whole unit becomes inoperable.Because of this cord issue, I had to buy a separate USB ""extension cable"" which costs as much as this device does, and worse yet: my experience with extension cables is that they can be flaky, which is obviously no good - ruins the integrity of this device.

  Nothing plugged into this would work. Took a look at the back of the package and saw, ""Some power-intense USB devices may require a AC-Powered USB hub"". Well, apparently that means anything you would actually want to plug into it. Mouse, Keyboard, wireless headset receiver and three different USB thumb drives wouldn't work in any of the ports.Well, fair enough, I can see how modern devices may require more power. It has a power port, what sort of AC adapter do I need to get? There is no input/output power information on the packaging or on the device model/serial number. So an AC adapter is a no-go.I tried plugging it into different USB ports (case ports in front are powered differently than the ports on your motherboard or back of the PC) and was able to get a ping for the wireless adapter, but the device was unrecognized by windows. All other devices didn't even register in the windows Device Manager.

  I absolutely love this USB hub. I work from home, and many meetings are handled through my Mac. As part of our privacy policy, I have to use headphones for these, since private customer information may be discussed.Previously, I used the ports on the aluminum full sized keyboard that came with my Mac. Since that keyboard finally died, I replaced it with another one that did not include the two USB ports. I was a little annoyed at first, since trying to fumble to plug the headphones in for meetings behind the mac was somewhat difficult. Additionally, needing to plug and unplug my iOS devices to accommodate this left me unimpressed, as well as having to sometimes juggle my USB stick when I needed headphones, and the iPod.This wasn't much of an issue when I could plug in to the keyboard, but behind the mac was just a pain.This USB hub was the PERFECT answer. In addition to giving me plenty of extra USB ports, the switching feature means I can leave my headset plugged in full time. I just press the button to have it go live for meetings, then go back to internal mic/speakers by turning off the port. Super Simple! The blue power indicators for each port are very nice, without being overpowering.I am looking to purchase a few more for my PC, and my family's PC's as well (including one with a wall adapter, for my power hungry devices)

  I purchased the Sabrent 4 port Hub with individual power switches because not all of the USB 2.0 ports on my older computer were functioning.  It was ""plug and play"" and although it took a little time on my Windows 7 computer to recognize it, once it did it functions well.  My grandaughter is home schooled and needs headphones and a mike as well as a camera for video conferencing. I only have three port that are either occupied or not functioning and this fills the bill.  I especially like the lighted buttons that indicate which port is powered and whether the usb it is plugged into is powered when the computer is turned off.  The connects seem solid and have had zero problems with how it functions.  If your computer is older like mine, checking for newer drivers wouldn't hurt.

  If you attach any device that requires a little extra USB power, it fails. The mouse worked, the PC mounted camera did not. My USB keyboard also did not work but it did work with my hand held camera which does not require USB power. So bottom line, you cannot use it to charge or supply much USB power to devices.

  I have  purchased similar multi USB ports devices in the past. However, most, if not all of them, weren't very quick. Or, they hung up and none of the peripherals connected wouldn't work. even though this is only 2.0, it's miles ahead of any other device I've used, including one from D-Link. this thing is quick and hasn't failed me once. I like that it has an on/off switch for each port. That's useful if you plug a flash drive into a port and plan to leave it there. I think one of the reasons it's so quick is that it has a short permanently mounted cable attached. The others that I have tried used longer cables. Regardless, to me, this is a must have.

  I bought this hub to extend the USB capabilities of my new Windows PC. I have a wireless mouse and keyboard, and after reading that USB 2.0 works better with 2.4Ghz keyboards (vs. USB 3.0), I chose this hub.The main reason I've given it an excellent rating is that ""it just works."" I plug it in, everything works, no configuration needed. I like that I can selectively turn on ports, even though I don't really use that feature most of the time. I like that even if I don't want to unplug it entirely, I can turn off the lights for sleeping (my office doubles as our guest room). I like that the cable is long enough to reach my laptop's port even when my laptop is on a stand.As another reviewer mentioned, there isn't great light isolation; particularly when the room is dark, the light from one button bleeds through and partially illuminates its neighbors. This doesn't bother me, but if it'll bother you, it's worth noting.

I like the ability to shut off a USB connection by pressing the button on the top and leaving the thing I plugged into the computer via the hub connected.

  Seems to work well on both Mac and Windows computers.  I specifically purchased to use with an Azulle Quantum Access computer, which only has a single USB 2.0 port.  I didn't expect there would be issues when I used the hub on an older Mac Mini and that turned out to be the case.  There were no driver issues with either operating system.  I have used all four ports simultaneously with no issues, but all the devices were very low power draws.  I am not sure what the cutoff would be with four ports relying on a single USB connection.  It is nice to have the ability to switch off devices without having to unplug.  There is the option to connect a second power source though the plug looks to be a unique standard.  Overall, I believe the Sabrent represents a good value.

  Gets the job done. I am using it for my usb accessories on the Xbox 360, as I only had two usb ports on the front and needed to plug in a kinect and wifi adapter via usb, in addition to my wired controllers. This fit the bill, and I like that you can toggle each port on and off separately so as not to waste power going to an empty port. I cannot speak to its charging abilities, as I only have 1 wireless controller and no cord to connect that one with for charging.

  I have had this hub for a few months now and have been using it daily on my desktop setup for gaming/audiophile/video production. The hub has all 4 ports used by gaming keyboard, gaming mouse, blue mic, and webcam.It works well as a stand alone hub with individual switches, but I have this inline with a USB 3.0 hub and it is very slow to initialize. It seems to not want to quickly recognize new devices and install those drivers. Once it does download the drivers and recognize the devices, it works great. Other than that fact, it works well and is able to connect my peripherals.

  I have a couple Sabrent USB switched hubs.  I run most everything through these because I can easily turn off and on the devices I want to use without having to un/plug them.  Saves wear on the ports and reaching behind the computer.  I use USB drives for backup, so I don't need them portable, lost, or running all the time.  -Click- Problem solved.  Same thing with my scanner; I don't need it on every time I sit down to my computer.  Also, I like being able to switch off my wireless adapter when I don't want to be connected to the internet.  It's especially handy if you are using a metered internet connection, like a cell phone.  If you plan on charging items or running multiple high-bandwidth devices at the same time (transferring large files between multiple external hard drives, etc.), I would recommend comparing this hub to Sabrent's 4 or 7-port switched hubs (USB-HPSS & USB-H7PS) which include a power supply that is optional to use.  The power supply just ensures maximum power to each port and can even be used off-computer as a multi-charge dock.  For simple accessory expansion (flash drive, wireless mouse, Bluetooth adapter, etc.), this hub is just right.

  Handy!  External hard drive (for backup storage), mouse (easier than trackpad), full-size ""real"" keyboard, digital camera download (via USB), iPhone/iPad sync with iTunes, Verizon dongle to connect via cellular to Internet -- the list of USB connections to my trusty 2009 MacBook Pro laptop is long and grows longer, and it only has two (2 - count'em) USB ports (more than recent Macs, but that's another story).  I do not want to wear out the USB connectors on Trusty 2009 (motherboards are pricey and difficult to replace), and would prefer to plug stuff into an external USB hub, replaceable/expandable as necessary.  This Sabrent 4-Port USB Hub fits the purpose. This rugged fellow is just what you need to expand, but allows you to remove just *one* connector when you want to walk off with the laptop for truly portable use.

  I purchased this hub to use with Raspberry Pi 2 Mod 2 setups and functions quite well with the Raspbain OS, as most likely will other hubs. Individual switched ports are a definite benefit to conserve power drain from the small RPi when those devices are not in-use/needed. And obviously the additional ports allow for other devices to be connected since the RPi only presents four. I connect a wireless mouse through it that I also use on a laptop and thus need to easily remove when using the other machine. Has functioned quite well and continues to do so, the only con is that it in not powered, which would also make the device more expensive. For the price it is a good buy and seems to be of good quality.

  It worked great for peripherals (mouse, keyboard, small light I use) I only had 2 ports in front of my computer, I really needed 3; so I got this thing.  It worked terrific, and no it didn't get hot as I'd seen others claim (maybe it did for them, but mine stayed cool). I had a minor water splash and I think some of it may have hit the unit, although all night last night it worked fine. This morning -- every port would NOT work.  So before I fully blame the unit, even though I've found quite a few claiming it gave out after a while, I'll give it another try, just to be certain it wasn't my fault.

  My new PC arrived with just two USB ports. I needed a minimum of three USB ports so I decided to give this Sabrent a try. It is well worth the small amount that it cost. The cord is somewhat short at about 8 or 9 inches but long enough for my purposes. Each port has a switch and a blue light to indicate when the switch is on. It works well for hooking up my printer, the exterior disc drive that came with my PC and a SanDisk that I use for backing up data. Could not be simpler to install or easier to use.

  I bought this to primarily use with Pen Drives. I do a LOT of work with them and figured the on off switch and the USB lighting would be a benefit, and THEY are. The problem? You can only use two and sometimes 3 of the ports at a time due to them being too close together and pen drives being wider than USB cord ends! If they had given a quarter inch more between ports then ALL would work, and I would be happy. But, alas... I will use it until it fails which I suspect will be quite a while as it seems to be durable. It would have benefited with say a 24-30"" cord instead of the 10"". The port on my desktop is too far up so the unit dangles which will probably accelerate wear on the plug wires. The price was too good to be true, and once more that old adage holds true.

  This USB Hub does something that I find should have been made years ago. It shuts the Flashdrive off without having to actually select it on the computer screen to shut it down and then remove it. Also, you have to press a button to turn on a slot to use in the first place, this allows you to add more than one Flashdrive without thinking about which is which that you are using at the time. Nice find! Saves little headaches like when the Flashdrive won't shut down because the computer has some phantom notion that it is still being used when you know that it isn't.

To a large extent a 1-port USB to 4-port USB hub is pretty much not going to produce a lot of surprises. It doesn't do USB 3, but I wasn't expecting that. In my tests, it seems to handle 4 peripherals at a time without slowing too much. This includes 2 hard drives that were powered through the port, so it does okay if that performance holds up.The little power switches might come in handy when I am doing something that would require my turning devices off for a bit, such as video chat which might be more data intensive, (I have not tried an external camera with this while using other devices,) but they really don't seem important for the price. I basically wanted a cheap,4-port for my 2-port laptop and this appeared to be as tough as any I could see.

  I could not be happier with this USB Hub.  I have never had a USB Hub with individual switches but it does seem like a good idea and I like the LED lights to let me know which ports are on.  I have used it for many things and it has worked great for all of my purposes.  The short cord makes this very portable and if I do need more I use a USB extension cord.The biggest load I have put on this hub involved charging my two Iphones (work and personal) plus a portable external battery (10000mAH).  This hub charged all three items as if they were all plugged directly into my laptop.I would recomend this to anyone looking for a good protable USB Hub.

  Great product, I've had one of these for years and used it on and off, and ended up getting another one a few months ago. Now I've got one mounted to my desk, and another connected to a hidden USB extension cord that extends to the middle of my house, for wireless controllers and accessories to have better coverage. Both are working reliably and provide better power to my gadgets than most of my USB ports do. The buttons are a great feature so you can easily reset a connection without even having to pull and re-plug the cable. And the lights let you know which ones are active. This thing does the job, I can't think of anything that needs change or improvement here.

  Bought one of these quite some time ago (years?) and it has worked perfectly for all this time. Bought a new laptop and needed to add at least two more USB ports, so bought this one. Had to set it up upside down on the cradle, so plugged in my two stand alone hard drives to ports three and four. Port three worked perfectly, but when I clicked on port four it came on, then instantly went off. I did it again (thinking I did not push it hard enough to click in)m and it did the same thing. Really drove my new laptop crazy. Four four has a switch that does not and will not stay in the 'on' position. Oh well, three out of four isn't so bad.

  I needed a simple USB hub for my Xbox One so I could hook up more hard drives and controllers.  Day 1 out of the box, my joystick was having issues when hooked up to the HUB.  It would either not respond at all, or the controller would be constantly scrolling down over and over.  I double checked to make sure the appropriate power button was active, and it was.  Next, I tried hooking up a Rock Band guitar USB device that made the old guitars compatible with the new Rock Band.  While the device works when plugged directly into a USB port, it would not work when running through the HUB.  Lastly, I figured I would hook it up to my PC so I have more ports for charging USB devices to at least get SOME use from the HUB, but none of the devices responded when plugged into the HUB.  After trying the USB HUB in 3 different scenarios, all with poor results, I gave up.UPDATE:  The manufacturer sent me a replacement product for free, which I haven't had any issues with yet.  So I've had a 50% success rate with this item.

  Item shipped quickly and was as described. I like the fact the switches are on this model and serve a couple purposes.

I found out (after long research, buried deep in [Nvidia] forums) that a 3.0 USB will not work to drive the K400 keyboard.  To use the K400, you *must* connect a 2.0 USB.So then I got the Sabrent 2.0 Hub.  I first attached the 2.0 Sabrent to my PC, loaded the Logitech Unifying software and it found the keyboard right away.So, it all worked out, but not before a lot of digging and research.  One feature that I really like about both of these hubs is the switches.  You can turn devices ON or OFF by simply using a switch.  I think that is so cool and very handy.  You might have an external drive that doesn't need to be on 24/7 constantly (I do), so that comes in real handy.  These Sabrent hubs do everything I need them to do.The Sabrent 4-Port USB 2.0 Hub saved the day!!  And I like the Sabrent 3.0 USB as well. I put it to good use on my PC.Thank you Sabrent!

  I'm surprised this got good reviews, but it could be that they are mixing the ratings between different models. The unpowered units (2) I purchased only worked sometimes. The first one was fine with a wireless mouse USB, an external keyboard USB and ONE brick. The fourth slot on the unit would not operate simultaneously with the third slot. The drives would often make scary noises and disconnect. The second unit also would not operate more than 2 bricks at once. There might be some sort of pass-through limitation, so I would advise folks to try the powered, faster units, although I have not tried them yet myself. Limited functionality gets it two stars; at least it did allow me to transfer my data between bricks although with less convenience than for which I had hoped.

  Awesome little hub that works very well.  The leds on top let you know which port is on and which is off.  No more powering down things to unplug them, just click the button on top.  Brilliant design.What you don't know about hubs:Hubs used to be used in networks as the main connection point for computers to talk to one another.  Some people probably still use them at times.  This is fine until you get too many computers talking to each other.  A hub is stupid.  It will send communication it receives to every port attached - even if the port doesn't need it.  For networks, this is terrible because so much little talk is being transmitted and received across different computers.  It will slow down immensely.A USB 2.0 hub is no different.  It's sending the data to every port.  With this having the ability to turn off the ports not being used, it speeds up the communication.  I like that I can keep some things plugged in and just turn them off when they are not needed.  The speed does go up, but it's also handy not seeing those things pop up in my computer window when I'm working.Yes, I recommend this hub - it looks great and works great

",2.0,Ceeze,"Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2014","









  
  
    
  It worked for me, but one of the issues I would have for some odd reason is that sometimes when I would have it connected, it would disconnect me from the internet. I spent a lot of time trying to troubleshoot this issue. As soon as I would disconnect the device, even though nothing was connected to it, the internet was able to be fine. Keep in mind I'm a Mac user. Also had this happen to another friend for the same reason who was also a Mac user. Not sure why this would happen. Their tech support didn't really provide an answer other than an RMA.The other thing is that it doesn't play nice with wireless devices like mice, which is kind of annoying, but oh well. Other than that it was great for hard drives and USB flash drives so if that's all you're connecting it, by all means it's a good product. Just had a few quirks that will not make me want to buy it again personally.

  It is probably a good Hub, but it didn't work for what I wanted to use it for.I bought it to plug into my USB port on my car stereo (JVC KW-NSX600) and the stereo won't recognize any device that is plugged into this 4 port hub. I tested it many ways, from multiple USB iPhone cables to USB sticks to one single cable nothing was recognized when plugged into the Hub. I was so bummed. JVC displays ""device not recognized"" on the screen. I thought this would totally work since it's not powered. It's probably not Sabrent's fault and I still don't understand why it won't work. But I wanted to to warn others.

    Best USB 2.x hub I've ever used
  
",5.0,krishnananda,"Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  I use a 21"" iMac for retouching. Because all of the ports are in the back of the monitor it is difficult to transfer images from cameras, thumb drives, and the like. Each port on the Sabrent 4-Port USB 2.0 Hub has its own dedicated power switch and blue LED power indicator. This speeds up the process of juggling different devices as I can turn off the port after ejecting without having to physically pull out the USB connector. The USB protocol implementation works equally well on the iMac, a MacBook Air, and a Windows 10 laptop. The construction quality is excellent. This is a great USB hub.

  It works fine but it started making really loud hissing sounds when charging - especially if you're trying to use a speaker or something. Basically, it will charge one thing at a time OK without hissing. But if you try to have more than one thing plugged in, it will hiss. It will also create a nasty background hiss while a Bluetooth speaker is plugged in. I lived with it for two years but I'm on here now trying to find something better b/c the hissing is driving me insane.

  Does what it should, and gives me 4 USB 2.0 ports. The ports are a bit tight, and it's a little hard to plug things in and pull them out, but I'd rather have that than things falling out during a data transfer. I like that you can connect a device, but that it won't activate until you push the button to turn it on, because it makes it very easy to connect and disconnect devices on demand. The ports are a little close together, so some USB devices may be too fat, but it seems to work for most things.The plug you connect to your computer seems to be recognized by your computer as a fifth USB device, but I'm not sure what it's supposed to do for you. It was recognized and successfully installed in both of my computers, and I was able to use all 4 ports with no problems.I was able to plug in a wireless USB mouse, as well as a USB powered hard drive, both at the same time with no trouble.My only complaint might be that the ports are a bit close. If they could put some more space between them, or stagger then on either side of the device, it would be perfect.

  Exactly as advertised, nothing more.  I found the cord to be a little short for my purposes and had to tether it to a USB extender.  The cord length is specified in the item description, at about four inches.  I thought that might be long enough to plug into the back of my monitor and sit on the desk--but it's not.  As such, it sits on my desk and is so light it slides back and forth a little too easily.  None of these things factor into my four star rating, however, as they are clearly specified in the description.  However, I found that it is sometimes difficult to tell whether the push button toggle is off or on, as the lights from adjacent switches illuminate part of the indicator on powered-off switches.  It is functioning well though, and is reliable.  You might just have to look a little closely at the toggles to know whether there is power going to individual USB ports.

  The ability to turn off individual USB ports is handy if you have more than one power-hungry accessory to plug-in. As long as all aren't in use at the same time, they can all stay connected and ready to use w/o having to disconnect one or more so there's enough power available (i.e webcam, portable drive, etc.)The on/off buttons are on top, and the cord is on the left side. If the cord were in back, it would be a little more flexible in placement on cluttered desks. An input port instead of a mounted cable would also provide more flexibility in situations like having the CPU tower under the desk and keeping the hub close at hand on the desktop.

  I am quite surprised at this Sabrent USB hub. I have always considered Sabrent as one of the best manufacturers of hubs and such, I never experienced any connection or  recognization problems. However, I bought this 4 port hub, and when I plugged it into my notebook computer, the entire computer became unresponsive. So, I tried it on a nother PC that I own, and I got the same results. Since this hub came from a third party seller on Amazon, and he asked to be contacted directly on the Amazon returns page, I did so, and he promptly replaced the hub for me. There was evidently an issue with the first hub, because so far, the second one has been working just fine. I like the individual switches for each port, because it allows for the easy removal or exchange of a device. I recommend.

  This little hub is awesome. My wife bought one first and recommended it to me, so now we both have one. I love having the individual push buttons, as I keep three charging cords plugged in all the time for my phone, smartwatch and Bluetooth headset. I hate wasting power when I don't need them on, so that's quite a handy feature. And it seems the hub has no problem passing plenty of power to the individual ports via USB3, though I've only had to use two of my charge cords at once so far.For the fourth port, I've used an SD card reader and my two-factor authentication dongle. I actually ended up moving the card reader to a port on my laptop dock because the SD card sticks out the side and interferes with the other cables. I think that's my only gripe, and it's a pretty minor one that not everyone will run into. Having my 2FA dongle in the fourth port is pretty nice so I can turn it off when not needed, eliminating the potential for some malicious code to give hackers access to my accounts somehow with the dongle sitting there unattended. (I've never heard of that happening, but I'd rather not risk it!)So yeah...good hub.

  This is a nifty little thing in that you can control each port individually. The LEDs behind said buttons give off a glow, but at a certain angle, it pokes past the translucent plastic and straight into your eyes. At night, the glow gives off significant blue light, making it difficult to sleep. After about three months of use, the device stopped working. It still delivers power and I can still toggle the switches, but data will not transfer and my computer will not recognize anything I plug in.

  I bought this 4-Port USB 2.0 Hub because my laptop only has two ports and I need to use one for my USB wireless mouse. (I do not like using the touch pad.) Since I have had past experiences with computer crashes and lost data, I store all my “stuff” (documents, photos, videos, etc.) on USB flash drives. If I wanted to transfer info from one drive to another I either had to copy to my desktop and then to the other drive or disconnect my wireless mouse. While I am satisfied with this product, bit it does have both Pros and Cons that I will list here:Pros:• I can keep up to four flash drives connected to the hub without having to remove them once I’m done. Each port has an on/off button allowing me to only turn on the drives I’m using.• The hub is small and light weight and each port has a blue LED indicator light to let you know which port is in use.Cons:• The cord is only about 9” long, so the hub will dangle if the desk area isn’t wide enough.• The ports are very close together and it is impossible to plug USB flash drives side by side. I use only SanDisk flash drives, but other brands may be narrower and fit better. My solution was to use USB extension cables. Their plugs are narrow enough to fit between the flash drives.For me, the Pros out weigh the Cons. It allows me the convenience to have up to four flash drives connected and ready to turn on and use at a moment’s notice. I give it 4 stars.

I can now use mouse and a portable 2.5' HDD simultaneously on my OUYA and I've got two extra ports I can use for other peripherals later down the road.It's worth noting that I had to use a Y usb cable to get the portable HDD to work because apparently the hub didn't supply enough power.

With nothing left to lose and my studio monitors getting lonelier with each day that audio wouldn't pass thru them, I opted to try the USB hub route.A quick search on Amazon turned up the Sabrent 4-Port USB 2.0 Hub.  The price was right, it arrived right on time, and it was the simple solution to what had been a complicated problem for several weeks!I have not used the hub for anything other than connecting my Mbox, so I can't speak to its performance as a multi-connector for external drives, etc.  I can only say that this simple, durable device has been a lifesaver at my particular work station.  If you work with USB devices and the recent ""upgrade"" to Yosemite has caused trouble for you, a separate USB hub may be a simple and inexpensive solution and the Sabrent 2.0 is perfect.

  I bought this exclusively to use with my logitech unifying receiver and my remote HTPC setup (PC is upstairs and HDMI USB and ethernet run to the living room).  Not only would my receiver not work with this hub, but it stopped working altogether even when i plug it directly into the back of the PC.  Im beyond pissed right now as this is the SECOND receiver that i have gone through with this thing.  Im sure its the hub as each receiver stopped working immediately after trying to get it to work with the hub.  this piece of crap may be alright to charge an iphone or two, but it definitely is garbage when it comes to actual hardware.

  The feel of the device is a bit flimsy, but it works like a champ. Of course, I considered the lighweight design an advantage while traveling.I bought this to use with my transformer tablet which only has one USB port.  During a trip where I was swapping pics with other travelers, I was constantly swapping out flash drives and portable hard drives with no issue.  I really like the feature of the individual power items for each device.  It means that I can eject in software and power off, without necessarily having to pull the drive immediately from the hub.I was able to put most flash drives side by side, but as we've all seen some flash drives are bulky and they sometimes get in the way of the adjacent port.  The next model could be spaced a bit more, but I tend to put the blame for the problem on the bulky flash drives.I would definitely recommend this.

I have a surface pro 3 and it only came with one USB port. I use a USB Mouse because it's easier to use and I have my USB with all the stored documents. Not to mention, I also have my back up 1TB hard drive. At any given moment, I may need all three on at the same time. Sometimes I hook up speakers via USB as well. This device not only allows me to have all four plugged in at the same time, but allows me to switch on and off the device I am not using without going through wires and set. I literally set all my devices once and all I have to do is plug in this device instead of several other devices. So, if I am listening to music, I press the switch for USB and USB back up drive to off, leave mouse and speakers on. If I'm working from home, I leave everything but the speakers on. If I'm on skype or havine a virtual meeting for work, everything is on! This device can handle multiple devices without overheating or becoming dysfunctional! Great product!

  My wireless keyboard's and mouse's receivers must be located close-by to work reliably.

My keyboard actually behaves better when its FOB is plugged into this product, than directly in to the laptop for some reason.  It can charge all three with no problem.  Another reason why I LOVE this particular one is that you can turn the USB slot on or off depending if you are using it or not.  When your phone is charged and you are busy, you can just hit the button and turn it off and keep working.  Doesn't sound like a big deal but you would be surprised how helpful that is.

  I've bought two of these now to fix the same issue that a lot of people experience these days when building a PC - lack of the older USB 2.0 ports on the case itself.  For my personal pc I bought an internal NZXT usb hub so it's out of sight and mind for a cleaner look for my wireless keyboard/mouse but i like using this for others that I build computers for as they don't want to have to open the case and would have no idea how to even unattach something from a board.  This little device is perfect for slapping a piece of velcro on the back and just plugging it into one of the USB 3.0+ ports available on the back of your PC thus changing it into a 2.0 and allowing you to plug in those little wireless adapaters for your keyboard, mouse etc.  So if you're frustrated from your wireless keyboard/mouse seemingly not working correctly, do yourself a favor and pick up one of these (it HAS to be the USB 2.0...they do make an identical looking 3.0) some velcro tape and just slap this puppy on the back of your pc out of sight and problem SOLVED.

  I use this with my laptop that only has 1 working USB port. I can now charge my phone, use my mouse, control an arduino, and plug in my external hard drive all at once. I really like the buttons that allow you turn turn off and on the ports. They supply a satisfying click and light up when they're on. I haven't noticed any slower speeds or heating up when using all four ports. It's lightweight and small so it's easy to carry with you to anywhere you use a laptop. If you feel like you don't have enough USB ports and do not want to spend a significant amount of money I would recommend this one.

    FABULOUS BARGAIN
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2019","









  
  
    
  First day using this and works fabulous. I will update this review if I notice anything in the future. Price is unbelievably low vs. quality for value. I had another component from Sabrent a few years ago and was very impressed with the quality for the very low price and this motivated me to buy their components again this time. This hub component is listed on the official Sabrent site at $13. plus shipping. Product arrived in a retail presentation package and the carton was secured with seals suggesting that it was probably not a used return. The only other feature to speak about are the on/off buttons. The 4 buttons can be used as 1 or all 4 or any combination of on/off 1 thru 4 and that is convenient. Only thing I can point out that does not show up easily in advertisement is that the hub is about the size of a  large pack of 10 stick chewing gum and is lighter in weight than expected so, the lightness of the hub weight will not necessarily allow it to stay lying flat on desk or table without cords flipping it over while using. However, the plugs stay in securely and it will remain connected. One must be alert and observe that moving one of the wires does not cause this hub to turn over and, then,  may press against one of the 4 buttons and turn off whatever one is charging. I combined this hub with the "" Sabrent 22AWG USB 2.0 extension cord 6 feet (CB-2060) "". This is available from same Amazon seller as hub. Extension cord allows hub to be behind computer and moves the clutter and chaos of wires out of the way. NOTE: Both of these items are available in an identical  "" USB 3.0 "" from Sabrent.

(2) two double-faced adhesive pads to anchor the device, which is very light-weight, might be helpful.  I would definitely buy this product again, even without the above suggestions.Amguez

  It is a charger and it works so you wonder what else can be said.  However, there are two things that makes this item stand out.  First, each port has a switch to turn in on/off.  So every port does not have to be drawing power when you have only one device plugged in.  Second, the company very generously offered me an extension cord at no charge after I had purchased the charger.  The cord that plugs into the wall is quit short so you have to be selective with which outlet you use.  I got a message a few days after the item was delivered offering me a free extension.  The cord adds flexibility to the charging device.

  I have used many usb hubs in the past. All of the ones that were used by me had a external power supply. And they didnt even perform as well as this one. Which did not come with a external power. The only things I needed it for was my mouse, keyboard and wired game controller. My  desktop replacement only has 3 usb ports. However one port is reserved for my bluetooth usb adapter, so I was constantly unplugging things. Because most of the time I am hooked up to a monitor for better resolution, my setup pretty much demands that I use a external usb keyboard. Fed up with unplugging things, I began the hunt for a usb hub again. Past hubs would often disconnect randomly, even when there were few devices plugged in. Once I saw the reviews for this item I decided to give it a try. I was also on a budget, so this one was fairly priced. Having been using it for nearly a week now, I must say this is the best working usb hub I have ever used for my setup. Have not had one disconnect since getting it. It does not come with a power supply, yet I see what appears to be a port for one. All I had to do was plug it in and vola. It also has buttons that activate and deactivate each port on it. Usually I only keep two ports active at all times. Other than whats plugged in, I dont use it for anything else. Because its powered from the computer, I am not going to plug high power devices into it, like usb external hard drives. For things like that I would recommend a good one with a external power. For what I needed it for, its actually really great. I am also running windows 10, and there are no compatibility issues. 5 our of 5 stars.

And whoever just happens to have a MacBook this works even better with this USB type c adapter.

For me, it does not charge your device but I did not purchase this item for it to charge a device such as phones and etc. I got this item specifically for my flash drive and to sync up any data that is on my iPhone. I am glad that it came in clutch, now I know what to use when the time comes for me to store data or do whatever I intend to do. If you feel that you need more USB slots, go for it, the more space you have, the easier it will be for you and it will be more convenient.

  In case you haven't noticed today's laptops have changed. Gone are the fussy, overheating, jumpy cursor, poorly lit, squinty, on-again off-again models of yesteryear. Nowadays, they are not only as portable as ever, but as powerful as all but the top of the line desktops. This capability is possible because of gadgets like the Sabrent USB 2.0 hub. Got a laser mouse? No problem. Need an external hard drive? No problem. How about a chillmat to keep things cool when the gaming gets hot? Well, no problem. You get the idea. Using too much battery life when everythings hooked up? How about individually controlled units that can be switched on or off as needed? It works very well indeed and the best part is that it doesn't take up much space to do it at a very affordable price. Highly recommended.

  This is an inexpensive solution to the problem of expanding the number of USB ports.  The strip of 4 USB ports can expand the number of devices connected to a microcomputer.  The device is small and lacks little space in a bag.  The ports are in-line, so if an external device has a wide plug, it will block at least one port.  The strip has an off-on button for each port.

The one I got all of the lights shine blue when you plug it in and it appears to be working great until you go to use the USB - none of the ports charged my phone or did anything when I attempted.

  These hubs are merely okay at best.  It is partly my fault for not paying attention to detail in the description.  I was expecting powered USB 2.0 hubs with switches.  I had previously ordered the USB 3.0 versions with the switches, but needed a couple of USB 2.0 hubs.  I figured this was from the same company and BAM I would be done.  It is okay, I do not blame the company for my laziness.  I am sure I will find uses for these hubs.  They work as intended, but not exactly what I needed.  The company was insistent on me giving a review, so I am giving one.  For anyone interested in these hubs, please note.....these are NOT powered hubs.  They only get power from the USB port that it plugs into, which is never enough in most cases.

(my 6+ foot Russell Westbrook [OKC Thunder] Fathead vinyl wall decal is another) This device is so convenient and easy to use. This is one of those devices that makes so much sense!I purchased this product for my Pioneer A/V Receiver, that has a usb port, so my wife and I could listen to the different genres of music we like at the press of a bottom.  For example, I like a mixture of rock, country and r&b. My wife, mainly, likes r&b. I also purchased some SanDisk Cruzer Fit flash drives which fit perfectly in this hub. Each flash drive stores the different genres of music.Things to remember:-Ports are close together, so if your flash drives are normal size or bigger, then you may, only, be able to use 2 or 3 of the ports.-When you first insert your flash drive, for the first time, be extremely carful not to force or shove it into the port; there are tiny contact pins in the ports that will bend if not inserted gently and straight. ( I speak from experience...this is my second one.) After the first insertion, I pull out and insert the flash drives normally.

  If my review headline makes sense to you, this will work perfectly for that particular use case.  It also is pretty small and was easy to conceal.I've used Velcro to mount this on the underside of my Tesla Model 3's phone charging/holding area. With the update that brought the dashcam feature, one port had to be taken by the USB thumb drive used to store the video. So this allows me to still have the integrated dashcam setup, but still have the charging cable on both sides.The ability to enable/disable each port with a physical hardware switch is quite nice. I can keep other things plugged in and not worry about phantom power draw. Unless you are going to secure it somewhere or keep it out of the way, this may not always be the best choice though. I could see it may increase the likelihood of accidental ""unsafe"" device removal if the buttons are accidentally hit. So be cognizant of what you intend to use this for and where you'll put it!

What happens is that the cable wire connections to the USB plug break loose and lose connection.It is connected to my laptop USB port so I can connect multiple simultaneous devices.  However, since I frequently change location the unit gets treated roughly.  Using it in a fixed location would subject it to much less abuse.

  My computer only has one USB port, so I needed a trip that would allow for multiple USB devices. This one fits the bill and is a great value for the price point. I like that there's buttons so you don't have to unplug (and lose) a tiny USB if you're not using it, just click off the button.

  I purchased this to add a few more usb ports to my pc...I installed it on the back and wrapped around the side and added a small piece of 3m double sided sticky tape to secure it to the side of my tower. All the ports work and the lights as well for each port. The lights turn on and off for each port when you toggle the power to that port. Its a bit chintsy that each light spills over to the next so when one is on it almost lights up two..no biggie just kind of cheap. But for the price what can you expect. It does the job its supposed to do,  The cord itself is a bit short for what I wanted but that's ok too. No biggie. Over all i'm satisfied with the product.

  I recently was given a laptop from my employer and the model that they use only has one USB port per side. As I need to use a WIFI stick on one side that blocks the port, that left me with only one USB port! I ordered this product, as it would allow me to plug my cell phone charger cord, mouse, larger desktop screen, and flash drive in all at once. I have been using this for a few weeks and it has worked out perfectly! I also like that it gives you the option to ""turn off"" a port by pressing a button. I don't always use my desktop screen or my phone charger, so it is nice to be able to cut off power to those items without messing with unplugging and plugging back in wires all the time. This saves battery life on my computer as well!

  I purchased this hub to use it for charging my Apple devices connected to a charger and not my computer, being able to keep them in the stand and turn on the one that needed to charge. It looked very smart for that purpose, the trouble was that it just doesn't work. The first line in the product information should have said: “Note: this hub can only be used connected to a computer and not to a USB charger”. If it had, I would not have purchased just another usb hub. It is only because it is too much work returning it for the cost of $6.49 that I don't.

    Great Convenience From A Great Value

  A perfect solution to expanding available USB ports. Extremely reliable and just as well built for great dependability, it has a cord length that is long enough to provide distance from your computer (perhaps 6"") yet not too long that excessive cord length clutters your work area.I use mine with my laptop that I use both at home and away. While I have four ports available, I leave it on my desk connected to my mouse, iPhone charging cord and WD MyCloud backup device to it, so that when I get home and connect to it (or leave) it's a single connect/disconnect. (I have a travel mouse for working away from home.)Am I lazy? That's not unfair. But on a practical level, forgetting to reconnect the MyCloud device after reconnecting the mouse and iPhone cord means I miss backing up that day's work; I'm diligent about backups because Murphy stalks me and his fourth law says something will happen to my laptop or hard drive the day it isn't backed up. For seven bucks, life is just a littttle less complicated. And I am worth it. In fact, I may be worth $14 as I am considering a 2nd device for my computer bag, even if there are a mere TWO devices plugging into it (the travel mouse & iPhone cord.I **am** worth $14.

  I bought one, just to try it out. Well, in the end I bought three more!I didn't expect the size to be so small and when I got it, I immediately felt like it was a good purchase. It had a very modern design, travel sized, everything is necessary and nothing was over the top.It doesn't feel like a top of the notch hub, but it doesn't feel cheap either. I'd say it feels good, reliable.Second thing I like are the individual power buttons for each USB. Sometimes, you just want to keep things plugged in but turned off and it's so easy with this.Why did I buy so many? There are a LOT of people in my family.. I am usually the one that buys items and if it's good I buy a few more as gifts for my aunts/uncles and siblings, even friends. My sister has a surface pro 3 and brother with a surface pro - they both love this hub when I gave them one each.I would recommend this to anyone who needs a reliable; travel sized hub with good design.

",5.0,T. Hu,"Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2015","









  
  
    
  When I first received this hub, I tested out all of the ports. They were a tad tight for a Logitech wireless mouse and keyboard USB drives, so I had to push a bit to get them in. One of the ports didn't work, and I noticed that the drive didn't go all the way in. Upon inspection, I realized--and I know this is probably not the technical term--that one of the teeth were bent and folded in. While I was hesitating over whether to contact the seller, since I couldn't be sure whether I broke the port when I pushed my USB drive in or if I received a defective product, the seller reached out to me for feedback. I wrote back explaining that one of the ports were broken, but that it could have been my own fault. The seller immediately sent me a replacement and told me I could keep the defective hub as well. I couldn't be more satisfied with their customer service. This was a situation where it's possible--maybe even probable--that it was not their fault (I spent quite some time pondering the likelihood of a bent tooth in the port being a manufacturing error...), and without hesitation they sent me a replacement. They were customer-oriented and responsive.So far I've had zero issues with the hub aside from their being a bit tight for my Logitech usb drive (other drives less so). It is a great product at a great price point. Overall, I am 100% satisfied with the purchase and with the seller's customer service.

    Great Accessory for a Laptop

  I gave the Sabrent 4-Port USB 2.0 hub 5 stars because it does what it claims to, inexpensively.  The ports are spaced far enough apart to accommodate thumb drives.  The cable is long enough to let the body rest on a desk, but not much longer than that.  If you use a laptop on a very small surface, the hub will hang off.  I tried it, and it did not unplug.  I had no issues when turning on or off the power buttons.  Note that I used only flash drives, and have not tested the device with an external hard drive.  For an external hard drive.  Also note that it is USB 2.0.  If your laptop has USB 3.0 ports, I suggest that you buy the USB 3.0 version.In sum, I purchased this to use with an older Dell Studio 1525, with only 3 USB 2.0 ports.  The hub is compact, and fits nicely in my computer accessory bag, and lets me work with all my thumb drives at the same time, for less than $10.  It's perfect for this use.
