    The perfect card for the Nintendo Switch!
  
",5.0 ,Chad S.,"Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2018","









  
  
    
  I got this for my Switch and you cannot beat it for the price. It doesn't take long to fill up the 32 gigs of internal storage, and if you buy a lot of digital games I highly recommend getting at least an 128 gig card. But the way the prices of these cards are dropping and with the holidays coming up, I'd keep an eye out for another deal on these 200 gig ones. You'll be glad you have the extra room.Also, I didn't rate the durability of the card, as I haven't had it nearly long enough to comment on that.

  I used this microSD in my dashcam.  It developed errors that could not be fixed and drive could not be formatted.Of note, it made my Thinkware dashcam malfunction (eg. the camera would spontaneously reboot, not boot up correctly, etc.).  I think that this behavior would happen with *any* defective SD card from any manufacturer.  Once I replaced the card, the dashcam performed as expected.

    Legitimate Sandisk card
  
",5.0 ,Bill,"Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2019","









  
  
    
  I have seen some complaints that these cards might be phony knock-offs. Admittedly, my purchase here was for ""only"" 32GB cards, but the complaints made me nervous, so I bought several cards directly from Sandisk. After paying a bit more and receiving micro cards that did not include adapters, I wish I had bought them here at Amazon, because their capacity and speed were no different, both for 64GB and 32GB of this particular card type. I can't promise for all cases, because I have had a number of fakes from other sources, without the labeled capacity or so slow that they weren't worth using and literally went to the trash. However, Amazon seems to have consistently sold me a valid product. I hope this is not just a matter of luck.

    128GB card testing at 50/70 MB/sec
  
",4.0 ,G. Gutierrez,"Reviewed in the United States September 27, 2018","









  
  
    
  I purchased the 128GB micro SD card and it consistently writes at around 50 MB/sec, reading at 70 MB/sec via USB 3.1 (using AJA System Test). The included full-sized SD adapter, however, barely allows writes at 5 MB/sec. Like another reviewer whose adapter actually melted, I probably received a bad one. I don't intend to use it, so that's no problem, but I would hesitate to buy one of these if I did plan on using the adapter. Aside from that, it appears to be a legitimate SanDisk card and I expect it to last. If that changes, you can bet I'll edit this review.

  i recently decided to buy myself this 128 GB memorystick for the times when i film an awful lot and want to film in HD. i used to worry about having a memorystick with so many GB, because i thought if something would go wrong i'd lose it all at once, but the 16, 32 GB filled up too fast. i have a couple of YouTube channels and am filming a whole lot. What i do is i put the projects on the computer after a few videos i film and so save the projects. i like all of these SanDisk memoysticks because they never really fail. We tried to buy one from China once and filled it up and then there was nothing on the memorystick. What did we save, but about $5.00. Some of our surveillance cameras take a 128 GB. Getting them from Amazon Prime is so great. What would we do without Amazon? Sabiene :)

    Not for use with a 4K camera!  Too slow
  
",1.0 ,,"Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2018","









  
  
    
  I purchased this memory card for use with a 4K GoPro camera.  While recording, the video skipped and pixelated.  When I went to replay the video, it gave me an error.  I switched to a class 3 memory card (this is class 1) and didn't have any of those problems.  I wouldn't recommend this memory card because of its slow speed.  It says up to 98mb per second, but it didn't reach that for me, unless I just got a bad card.  Spend the extra money and get a class 3 card; it will be worth it.If you found this review helpful, please show some love by clicking the ""Yes"" button below.  If not, click “No”.

  Always afraid of buying memory cards from the net but since I was buying from Amazon & not a 3rd party, figure why not? Definitely made sure I was buying from Amazon directly & turned out to be good real memory card so far with no problems.

  Sandisk is the best memory card maker out there.  Not necessarily the cheapest, but there are stories of fakes and defective products from no-name suppliers, so I figured, better safe than sorry.I needed a larger memory card for my 128-gig Macbook Air.  Originally I got a 128-gig memory card to use for backups, but it's not enough for Time Machine, which requires a little extra space for incremental backups.  So I swapped it out for this 256 gig card, and now backups are working well.The ideal would be a 512gig card, but those are still rare enough that they don't ship immediately, and are rather expensive.  Eventually, they will come down. But in the meantime, this is probably the best chip on the market. I'm probably going to get one for my phone as well!

  When formatting, be aware of partition size and adaptor type. I couldn't get mine to work until I actually put it in my MP3 player and formatted with the device itself. When I did it with the computer, it gave me false capacity display and it was a constraint on either the USB adaptor I was using, or the USB port, or both. I managed to see the whole capacity in a laptop SD card slot, but my USB adaptor was useless.When you do some reading about selecting SD card type and size, there's a ton of stuff to learn. The bigger card sizes aren't as easy to manage as the ones that are 32GB and less.

  Good choice for a back up/dash cam.  Very good video on the cameras.  I installed this on a 1999 Plymouth Voyager minivan my daughter is using as a new driver.  Overall easy to install, took me about 3 hours, but I was taking my time.  Cables are plenty long,  I used power from the cigarette lighter in the rear of the van.  Only two small negatives to mention, the mirror does not seem have an angled night mode, annoying.  Second, it would be nice to have the option of the video only for back up, then when putting the car in drive the video screen goes dark.  Right now it waits one minute before going dark.

As this sandisk card is class 10 and supports High Definition video recordings and works like a charm with my dash cam.Read speed is almost accurate when I tried to copy videos to my laptop. I also tried to copy a 2 gb file and write speed was not a described in the product description but I beleive both read and write speeds depends on type of file youbare working on.But sandisk being a very popular and reliable brand I would always try to go for these cards and they always have good prices going on.Overall quality, performance and value of the card is better than other competitors.

  I got this card in June and have been using it till now. But after using it and the storage got filled half way, the files started disappearing!  I thought it was a problem with my camera, but other cards continued to work fine. Then I ran hwtest on the card and shocked to discover that it's actual capacity is less than 30% of the stated amount! A 128GB card is being peddled as 400GB card. I called Samsung who took down the serial number on the card and told me that it's a fake! My Amazon return window is long gone, so there goes my $58. I had bought a smaller capacity version earlier that works fine. So a word to others - if you buy this, please run HW tests using any sd card testing such as h2testW and make sure the capacity is what's promised and the card works before the returns window closes.

",4.0 ,Itchy Scratcherson,"Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2018","









  
  
    
  not a paid review… my 1st IR motion-sensing camera  Out of the box, the English menu really was super-easy to understand. The English part of the user manual is only 8pp. long.  I turned off the beep, which sounded every button press, then set date & time. It seems the amount of available light, not time of day, makes the device shoot pics in color or b&w. In default “shooting” mode, the actually very decent (useful, large-ish) LED screen changes its display from color to b&w & back, dependent on whether one points at bright or dim subjects.  Menu has a (MP/megapixel) setting for still photo resolution & a separate setting for motion video resolution :JPG PHOTO—5 choices from “1MP (1280x960P)” to “14MP (4416x3312P)”AVI VIDEO—(5 choices from “320x240P” to “1920x1080P”).Regardless of which resolutions you choose in the menus, color photos & videos will naturally use more disk space (micro-SD memory space) relative to identical black & white photos & videos.  I’m using an iMac to view pics/ vids… of course, the mini-SD card works on Windows too. (I’m a Mac user since ’92.)  All comments based on 12 days & nights' experience... keep in mind cameras were only ever ~3 feet off the ground. It’d be best to be able to compare it’s motion-sensing sensitivity to another camera brand. Sorry, I cannot. I can say the device gives you feedback as you walk side to side in front of the camera in “set-up” mode: an LED lights green as it detects you entering its peripheral range. The actual results seem to correspond to 120˚ detection and 120˚ recording range (as stated in the manual), but that may be a little generous. How can one *easily* test that? Also, keep in mind that by nature, in daylight LED IR cameras sense motion further away than in darkness. In darkness, motion sensing seems to work as advertized & should be pretty good for “the woods”. In daylight, 35mph passing cars & trucks triggered the motion sensors from 20 meters for sure. It seems uncertain whether that is fact re: sensor sensitivity in darkness (when the IR LEDs are doing their thing).  I’m documenting domestic cat activity, and my slinky local medium-sized possum has evaded the motion detection, BUT I suspect this is b/c I WAS POINTING toward my porch spotlight (which wasn’t in “flood” mode, but provided enough light to defeat the motion detectors at least somewhat). The camera was approx 20’ from the light source.  On the other hand, at 30’ from the same light source, the T45 captured a mouse. A house cat should trigger motion-sensors every time. At night, I’ve captured mice, rabbit, skunk, possum, raccoon, and cats with this camera.  The micro-SD slot is not so user-friendly, but this isn’t a show-stopper, imo. If one is willing to own a device that uses these tiny tiny memory cards, one accepts the experience. Just bring tweezers and hold a hand underneath the unit so you can catch it if it falls.  I’m using 8 (Rayovac, btw) AA batteries, but the manual states you can load & run this camera on four OR eight AA batteries. It states not to use rechargeable AAs.

  Crapped out after only a year and a half, and will take days to scan and hopefully recover lost photos and videos, and to reinstall software that I used to run off the card to my phone's internal memory. Pretty disappointing, since I usually trust cards to be reliable for at least five years.Edit: After numerous attempts to recover my lost photos and videos, it is clear that the card is corrupted beyond repair. All of my data was lost. I've never had a card that couldn't have data recovered until this one. This really is a sketchy card.

    Worked with the NVIDIA SHIELD Tube TV (2019)!
  
",5.0 ,Zach S.,"Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2021","









  
  
    
  Worked with the NVIDIA SHIELD Tube TV (2019)! My NVIDIA SHIELD TV storage space started running low and so the venture to get a Micro SD Card in there to expand it. I first bought the Samsung (MB-ME32GA/AM) 32GB 95MB/s (U1) microSDHC EVO one, but as soon as I popped it in I got the notice that the card was too slow and I should be looking for a U1 card. I ejected, put it back in but kept getting it. So thinking that card might not be compatible, I found this one. Searching for the SHIELD TV yielded results that other people had success using it with their SHIELD TV's. Ended up buying the 64GB version, so I pop it in and guess what? Same thing happened. So annoying. But at least this time I did get the option to reformat it which I didn't with the other card. But after I kept doing it, I kept getting that same response. The only other thing I thought to try was to reboot the SHIELD TV with the card in it. So that's what I did, and this time it worked! So if you guys are running into that issue with your SHIELD TV, try unplugging it to reboot and that should do the trick. Hope NVIDIA fixes that bug, cause that was annoying. I expect the Samsung card is fine too since I didn't try rebooting with that in it. Now this SanDisk one is working great so far. Happy with my purchase (now that I got it working).

  I bought this for a Samsung S9 to replace a 64gb card. The last card loaded pictures from the phone very quickly as if they were stored on the device. That card was 3 years old and i was running out of space. This card while having much more capacity appears to be much slower as well.

  I needed some more memory for my Ellipsis 8 HD tablet so I decided to give this card a go. San Disk is a good name and the price was right for the 64 GB card. Despite the fact that the tablet suggested that the card was a little slow, I do not seem to be having any issues with it starting out and now I have space for more apps and documents.With the knowledge that there are some fraudulent SD cards floating about, I did verify the card I received. First I used the SD Formatter app (from Tuxera) on my Windows 10 machine to format the card and then I turned h2testw 1.4 loose on it. While I didn't really pay too much attention to the speed, it looked about right and the capacity was definitely right on. (I should have done a screen cap, but oh well.)

  I prefer SanDisk SD cards as opposed to other brands as they are reliable and have high longevity, so I chose to buy this one (64GB Ultra microSDXC UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter). It works fine as an extra storage device. However, when formatting it with a brand new smartphone on Android 8.0, the system informed me that any apps/etc. run from this card would run slow if formatted to be used in this way. Long story short, I am not mounting this as internal storage but simply keeping it in the bay to move media on/off my phone. I guess this isn't a big deal to me, but it might be for you.Another thing, usually when I buy these micro SDs with adapters, they come with a resealable little plastic blister pack that the adapter can be temporarily stored in after you first buy it. This one didn't come like that. The blister pack was not resealable, so make sure you have somewhere safe to store your adapter (preferably not just loose in a drawer somewhere).

By default the user name is admin and the password is blank.  I even pushed the reset button to make sure it was on factory default settings.  Nothing worked.  So I tried to contact their tech support.  They only work through emails since their office is in China.  After a week of exchanges with them ending in them asking me to do a video of me trying to set it up so they could see what I was doing.  When I told them I was done and going to give them a negative review and that my original request to replace the camera was now going to be a refund, they asked me not to write the review and that the would handle a refund directly.  I am returning the camera through Amazon.

  I used this 200GB memory card primarily for my GoPro Hero 5, to record 4K videos. The card worked well, and I used it to record at least one hundred hours of videos over the approximately 2 years I have owned it. I would fill the card with videos, eject it and use it in a card reader for my computer, move the videos to the computer, erase the card, and then put it back in the camera. Most recently, I ejected the card and when I put it in the card reader, it said it was unformatted and it could not be read. Windows detected it as a 64MB module with unknown formatting.I examined the card and found it has a hairline crack in it where the ""lip"" at the back is, to grip the card and remove it from a camera or other slot. I am extremely careful with my memory cards - it goes from the camera to the card reader and back again, and is never mishandled or bent. I can only assume they use very cheap, brittle plastic, and other cheap materials, and the card cracked through regular wear and tear. I sent the card to a data recovery company. They said the NAND chip (memory chip) embedded in the card is physically damaged and no data can be recovered. Goodbye videos from our first Disney vacation (pre-pandemic). I guess at least we have the pictures from our cell phones to remember it.

  This appears to be a very nice, well thought-out design and I really wanted it to work for us. I was unable to get it to connect to our wireless router, however.  In this process, I reached out to both Chris and Jack, and they did an outstanding job of quickly responding to my situation with advice.  But ultimately we concluded there was some unknown compatibility problem and the immediately refunded my through Amazon.  Can't ask for more than that.  The instructions are a bit hard to follow so I'll share what I learned step by step.  Before starting, check your wireless router via IP address browser connect to make sure you will only be accessing 2.4GHz (if you have a dual band router) by either assigning different SSID's to 2.4 and 5GHz or disabling 5GHz. Make sure your router is set for Dynamic Protocol.  Save and exit.  Then  (1) download Littlelf app from Google Playstore, install, and set up account with name and password (requires e-mail for verification and code). (2)  Set your cell phone location to ""device only, GPS"" for purposes of the installation.  (3) Select the ""wireless"" installation option on the Littlelf app.and select the correct SSID and Password for your 2.4GHz WiFi radio line (4) Turn up the volume on your cell phone all the way. (5) turn on the camera and wait a minute for it to power up and for the red LED to flash, then press and hold the reset button for 2 seconds with a bent paperclip or other thin wire until you hear two ""beeps"". (6) A timer will start running when you proceed and the cell phone will send SSID and password information via a chirping sound to the camera, so hold the camera mic close to your cell phone speaker. (7) When the information is successfully received by the camera, it will make a ""ding-dong"" sound and the red LED will turn green. (8) Hit ""next"" on the phone app when prompted based on hearing the ding-dong sound.  (8) Another timer will then count down from 120S as the camera tries to connect to your router.  This is where mine failed.  Hopefully yours will connect successfully.  If not, Chris and Jack will be ready to help you.

I need to use them in a Raspberry Pi and the cards are very difficult to remove once they are inserted into the Raspberry Pi microSD slot.

  I bought this to use with my DJI Mavic Air, but I put it in the drone and got a message saying ""Slow Card"".  The drone/software thinks the card isn't suitable for 4K video capture from the drone.  I did one test flight with it and did record in 4K/24fps.  The file looked fine when I played it back so I doubt there would've been any trouble recording to it.  I also have a

The Samsung card was in a tablet so I'm swapping them out.  I did notice that the when writing to the cards the Samsung averaged about 32 MB/s while this card hung around 24 MB/s.  I didn't do any actual speed benchmarks, this was only transferring a few GB of pictures to both cards.  Based on that I can't deny it's slower than the Samsung, but still probably would've been adequate for the video from the drone.  It may also be some metadata label on the card identifying it to the drone as U1 whereas the Samsung is U3, but that is purely speculation on my part.  However, for the same price, I'll be buying the Samsung in the future if I need more of these.

Not only that, they show the specs for the sibling A2 SD card and it is rated at ""Up to 60MB/s"" write speed.The write speed for the A1 is around 14Mb/s for those who are wondering.

  I have two of these microSDXC cards.  Both are 128gb.  I actually have more (that I've used in cameras and such in the past), but, for this review I will focus on two of them.  I've been using them in my Microsoft Surface Pro 2017 Edition and my Microsoft Surface Go.  Both my Microsoft Surface's have 128gb of internal memory.  I got them these micro SD cards to basically double their memory.  It gives me a place to unload camera files, save my rendered video files, and more.  I can unload them anytime needed to an external had drive at home.  But, when on the go, they provide me with a lot of extra space.  Also, they spare the internal computer memory from excessive and extra writes and deletes, since I put files on here that may not stay on for very long.  I do keep some files on here for extended periods, but, I like to keep them free enough, especially when traveling, to unload my cameras files.  All in all, I've had many of these cards over the years.  Never had one fail.  Never a single error or issue.  Honestly looking at my Amazon orders, I've ordered at least 10 of these over the past 7ish years.  Their price isn't bad either!  Prices fluctuate, so, just watch for a day or two and see if you aren't in a hurry.  Don't buy off brand memory for important files, stick to name brand!

  Capacity was exactly as advertised although I would recommend before you buy any card to check who the seller is.  In this case make sure its being sold by Sandisk the company and that it is PRIME approved because there has been a rash of foreign copycat sellers that are relabeling lower capacity cards then underselling the same product.If you are looking for a quality card then this one works perfect for the Switch and for its price is far cheaper than the licensed product by nintendo or many others.  I paid over $70 US dollars for this so if you find one that is far cheaper and not on sale in addition to not having a PRIME logo on it,  I would steer very clear of such products.

Since I have amazon prime, there wasn’t any additional charge to receive the product.I am amazed at how well these work and how low the price has gotten the last few weeks. Putting one of these into your security camera is a super upgrade to the device’s storage needs.Almost no one needs this much memory on a security camera  but at sales prices like these you can’t pass up getting them.This is a good  product and it makes your cameras  even more powerful.This is a no brainer and easy upgrade for your all your home security  devices.

  I read the negative reviews about all the problems with this product on Amazon.  I decided to buy it anyway, trust but verify.  Initially I thought I got a fake card as several of the popular test programs reported errors writing or reading the card.The real problem turned out to be the small plug in card reader I was using.  This style of reader and almost all card readers made before 2007 have a maximum capacity of 64GB.  They are incapable of addressing memory locations above that point.  These old tech readers are still being sold.  They are even sold right here on Amazon. Once I got a modern card reader h2testw was able the write and verify files for the stated capacity and the card functions fine in my compatible phone.So before you assume you got a fake or defective card make sure the card reader and device you intend to use the card in are both capable of handling a 128GB card.

I removed the card and inserted it into my Linux server - no problems accessing the filesystem that way. I copied some movies onto it, then put it back in the Kindle. Nope. None of the files were visible.Then I re-formatted the card directly on the Kindle itself, then put it back in the Linux server where it (again) mounted just fine and let me copy files onto it.This time, when I put it BACK in the Kindle, all was good - movies were visible and playable.I guess whatever default format this card comes with just isn't Kindle-compatible.

I set it up for motion sense. I tried to format the card. The device says no card present.

I went through this procedure three more times and finally the device thinks it has a card. It did this every day. So let me emphasize. and recap.The device will not connect to WIFI, the device will not stay on a motion detect setting, the device is flaky and most days it records all the time (not motion detect at all, it defaults to loop) and the last day I used it all looked good I went through the format memory disk and all looked good ( I thought) and wham I came back to the room, no video was recorded.

  I bought two of these. The first one works fine and has continued to work fine so far, knock wood, fingers crossed, no whammies. Great price for the amount of storage, pretty fast, works with Windows and Mac computers, nothing to complain about.The second one, which I bought two months ago, abruptly and completely died today. As in, none of the many recovery utilities I tried could do anything with it, it was like the partition with all the data on it was gone. I had just copied some MP3s to the drive and was going to play a few back to verify that they copied OK when Windows reported that the drive was unreadable and needed to be formatted. Stuck it in a Mac using a different adapter, same story. The drive normally has two partitions on it, a tiny 32 MB partition and the big 64 GB partition. The tiny one was still there, but corrupted, the big one was gone. No drive or partition recovery utility could see the big partition at all. They could all see the tiny partition and wanted to format it.Well, it'll be a hassle to recreate, but there wasn't anything on there that I didn't have backups of. Sometimes years of painful experience and resulting paranoia pays off.The failure has been a good reminder that sort of thing happens with (micro)SD cards. They work great until they don't. It used to be pretty common. But it's been a long while since I've seen one that died in the middle of accessing it like this one did, and that died completely unrecoverably. I've had pretty good luck with SanDisk products up until this one.Buyer beware.

  These new ""A1"" class cards are very noticeably faster when used as the OS drive in single board computers like the Raspberry Pi3B. Normal SD cards are highly optimized for sequential read/write, which is what is done in cameras, but a computer OS does a lot of non-sequential I/O, and most SD cards are terrible at that. And I mean really terrible! Like hundreds of times slower than ""A1"" class cards!Swap the old Class 10 SD card in your Raspberry Pi3B for one of these and it will seem like a new computer. The ""A1"" class cards were designed to speed up app performance in phones and tablets, but the benefits apply to single board computers as well. So whether you want to speed up your phone or single board computer, the ""A1"" class cards are the ones to get.It won't make CPU intensive software run faster, but it will make the whole system more responsive and eliminate most of the little stutters and pauses that plague singe board computers using SD cards as their boot drive.

  To start off with if you are expecting to get WRITE speeds of 100 mb/s forget it, a card like this would be much higher in price.However i knew beforehand this would not get these WRITE speeds but i was hoping i could get the 100mb/s read speeds but i did not.I only tried it on my desktop using a usb.3.0 card reader ( from trascend)Write speeds were 23.5 mb/sread speeds were 32.0 mb/sFor reference it took  2 hrs and 13 min to fill up the entire card with data, and 1 hr 37 min to read it.Using this on a phone ( samsung galaxy s5) it wasn't too different, the write speeds actually droped to 20 mb/s while the read speeds jumped a bit higher to about 40 mbs. Please note ''up to 100 mbs speeds'' means potentially not promised however i could not even get half of the potential speed.Overall if you can get this card below $60 go for it ( i never thought id say this for a 200 gb micro sd card!) , otherwise if speed is important to you go with a faster card probably the sandisk ''extreme'' line which normally have a gold color ( but x3 times more expensive)I am not entirely disappointing with the card, mine was for simple use but anything actually requiring the speed may want to hold off.for those people that doesn't understand how hard drive and memory formatting  work ill list the formated exfat size so you know the actual size formatted  : 183GB

",4.0 ,Hermosatech,"Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2018","









  
  
    
  I bought 3 of these based on the great reviews.  My feeling, so far, the camera is pretty good and may be worth the accolades.  My review is based only on having just set the cameras up, not a long-term review.  The setup instructions are provided on a 3-fold document the size of a tissue.  The text has some English grammar flaws.  Still, the setup went fine with only one glitch:  The instructions say to download the app and connect the phone.  No problem there.  The camera and app sync'ed just fine and provided video immediately.  Great!  Then instructions then say to format the memory card in the camera while guided by the downloaded phone app.  But I kept getting an error saying there was NO CARD DETECTED.  The website doesn't make contacting the company for help easy.  However, I discovered that unplugging the power to the camera, then replugging saved the day.  The camera took a few moments to reconnect with my wifi.  THEN I retried formatting the card, and was successful.  Caution, the instructions say the formatting will take 2 to 4 minutes -- and it's true.  So be patient while waiting for the formatting.  The camera will go offline temporarily and the app will note that the camera is offline.  After the wait, however, the camera will return online and the app will again show that.  So here are my final comments:  1) Downloading the app and initially connecting the camera worked perfectly, including getting video on the app.  2) If the app says NO CARD DETECTED when trying to format the card, try unplugging the camera for a few seconds, then replugging.  Allow the camera time to reconnect to your wifi (a minute or so), then try reformatting the card per the instructions.  3)  The camera will go offline about 4 minutes during the formatting.  I still have a question, however:  Is there a way to view the camera video from a computer, or only on the phone?

When I called customer service, the person said, it was a typical value.  This much discrepancy should not be typical, rather an aberration.Sandisk is charging customer for products that they do not provide.

  When this SD Card works, it works well.  The problem is that I don't know when/if it will or not.  There are times when it will stopp accepting files and I have to reboot the phone to get it to work again.  I even took the card out & did a full scan for errors to find and repair the errors.  So far that has worked.........until it doesn't.  There were a few times when the card was not recognized by the phone but did recognize the SIM card in the same drawer.  None of this should happen on such a regular basis, but I'm giving it many chances to work right And work well.

  MicroSD cards are a little odd in how versatile they are.  You can use them with adapters in DSLRs or as secondary storage in a laptop with an SD slot.  You can use them in phones, game systems, and other devices (dashcams, action cameras, security cameras).  The versatility means that you can have dramatically different requirements from use case to use case, and that a specific MicroSD product may be good for one, but not another.  What about the SanDisk Ultra 200GB microSDXC UHS-I card?If I'm being completely honest, I wasn't in the market for a high-capacity MicroSD card.  I was on a Kinja site and saw mention of a really good deal on these cards, so I bought a couple of them.  I knew when I bought them that they are a tier or two down from SanDisk's Extreme Pro line, but I was going for value at capacity, not raw speed.That's the rub, really... the cards are not fast.  How slow are they?  Though ATTO isn't the best tool for measuring MicroSD cards, I've still included a screen grab of the testing run.  Writes max out around 50MB/s, and reads at around 80-ish MB/s.  That's a far cry from the 100 MB/s write / 115 MB/s read that you'll get by spending more on a faster card, especially when you look at what happens to the speed of this item with SMALL random write and reads.So, who is this for?  Well, if you're looking for large storage to add to your phone or tablet, this is a good buy.  It's also good for non-DSLR cameras of almost any type.  What it's not as good for is to use as primary or secondary storage for a PC or laptop.  It also wouldn't be a good choice for DSLRs, in my opinion.  If performance is your primary need, you should look elsewhere, as there are faster choices.  However, if you're ok with the speed penalty, this is a solid product, and I recommend it.

  Bought this item for my Nintendo Switch. Didn’t see any signs of tampering with the packaging and the card looked good (no uneven color, bad letter printing, etc.). After multiple reformats and failed attempts to transfer my library I downloaded a program to test the SD card. Turned out the read/write rate was much lower than advertised (about 15% of what it should have been) and more than half of the card was corrupted. I decided to go ahead and purchase one from a store in town after returning the defective card which worked great. If you do purchase this product I would highly recommend testing it on arrival.

  First off, I ordered a new SD card.The SD card arrived in what appears to be a repurposed piece of the large bubble wrap.  The exterior cardboard packaging of the SD card itself has been cut significantly and taped shut with ordinary ""Scotch"" type tape.  The interior protective plastic packaging that actually protects the SD card has also been cut opened and taped shut.  In addition to the open packaging, the protective covering has been crushed, potentially damaging the card.  It is not worth the risk of placing the obviously tampered with device into any of my devices.  This was clearly a deceptive tactic.  Sending a very obviously used item in place of the ordered new item without customer consent is certainly an inappropriate tactic.

The only thing I didn't like was that on her chromebook the slot doesn't let you insert the card/adapter fully, it sticks out a little.  I had intended for her to simply stick the SD card in and let it stay in the machine effectively raising the innate 64Gb of memory an additional 200+Gb, but it sticks out.  It's not a huge deal she just has to carry it in the sleeve for the laptop and only insert it and put stuff on it if she needs to.  A good purchase even if it wasn't EXACTLY what I had intended.

When I plug the microSD to my computer, Win 10 wants to format it but can't. However, when it is plugged into my phone, I can access the files in the microSD card through my phone. So I can only conclude that this microSD card had some internal wiring restriction that won't work for Windows and only for Android. It's not a complete waste of purchase since I can use this to upgrade the microSDs on my wife's and my phones. But I am disappointed that this card is made so limited in use.

I always try to go above and beyond surface characteristics and input into quality, value and application.

  Decided to purchase this 400 GB microSDXC card for an upcoming trip out of the county. Just like you I read some of the recent reviews warning of cheap knockoff cards being delivered. Seeing that its a ""SanDisk"" fulfilled by Amazon and at a huge discount, I decided to roll the dice and hope for best. This was a mistake.After I put the card in and formatted it, Windows 10 recognized it as a 395GB drive. Awesome, I was one of the lucky ones that didn't get a fake. Or so I thought. I loaded a few files onto it and everything seemed to be working fine. Just to double check, I downloaded one of the free programs floating around that verify the integrity of SD cards. 30 minutes in I received an error message saying there was an error with the card. The program said my card had only a little over 6gb of usable storage. Thinking this might be a fluke I downloaded another similar program. Same outcome. As a final check I decided to try and copy 20gb worth of files onto the card and a windows error popped up saying there wasn't enough space. This advertised 400gb card is really a 6gb.The packaging and build quality were just good enough subdue my suspicion. I urge anyone purchasing on of these cards to run a check on it.

    HIGHLY FUNCTIONING AND AFFORDABLE MICRO SD CARD FOR THE NINTENDO SWITCH!
  
",5.0 ,AllieR,"Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  There's nothing to dislike about this product. It does what it claims to do, it does it well, and is VERY reasonably priced...especially when you compare it to the cost of equivalent micro SD cards just a year or two ago.I bought this product for my Nintendo Switch because the core system only comes with a measly 32 GB of system memory, only 25 of which can be used for games/downloads. I love my Switch, but this core memory was just not enough. Switch games are smaller in file size than the average Xbox One or PS4 game, and I will typically try to get physical copies of the larger games anyway, so a 200 GB micro SD seemed like more than enough.After doing research and talking to some techies, the best choice for a reasonable micro SD came to be the SanDisk Ultra. The Nintendo Switch doesn't support READ speeds higher than 100 mbps (which the Ultra caps out at), so buying a more expensive card that specifically supports that higher read speed would only be a waste of money for use in relation to the Switch. I've seen multiple people test the loading times and performance of games off of higher end cards that are technically more ""capable"" than the SanDisk Ultra, only to find that everything is EXACTLY the same. As long as your card can reach READ speeds of 90 mbps or so, you're perfectly fine using it for the Nintendo Switch.The one minor benefit you would get from a more expensive card is a higher WRITE speed, meaning games would download a little bit faster...but if you are downloading games at the end of sessions, and overnight, it would be a nonissue anyway.Pure and simple $27 and free shipping (with Prime) for 200 GB of memory on my Switch? That's a steal.

I've been able to transfer all of my switch games over to this monster of a card with no problems and when I play the games they load up just fine with no errors. If you're looking for a new SD card look no further get this card before the price goes back up.

  Purchased for my Nintendo Switch, works perfectly! I originally thought it didn't work because I kept getting an error on my console when I copied my old SD to the new one using my macbook, but apparently the issue was introduced because I used a macbook due to how their files are stored on their SD format. I switched over to Windows, copy/pasted my data from the old to the new and everything just worked like nothing ever happened.Also, I learned that the Sandisk Ultra is actually faster than the Sandisk Extreme for nintendo switch. this is because the Switch explicitly supports the SDXC-UHS-I. So if you're looking to benefit from the speeds on the UHS-III, you're going to actually lose performance by a 10th of a millisecond.TL;DR: If you're looking for a SD card for the switch, no matter the capacity, this is the highest performing chip available to you.

  I ordered SanDisk (Western Digital) brand because i was sure that I would receive high quality cards, however this is not what I got.  I tested a total of 4 - 256 GB cards with h2test (very simple storage media testing application) and found all had bad sectors. Two of them were capable of holding less than 1 GB. One of them passed the first test but failed a second test (I only tested it twice because the others failed). I'm confused about this because I normally trust SanDisk memory devices, and these cards appear to be sold by SanDisk through Amazon... SanDisk devices purchased from Best Buy and Walmart always test with no problems. Its getting really hard to avoid ""fake"" flash media devices online. Not sure if these fall into that category, but based on my experience, I would not trust them. I returned them and purchased Samsung cards instead. All Samsung cards passed the test with no errors. If you're not familiar with h2test, then you should download it and test your flash drives and SD cards. It takes a long time to test high capacity devices, but it could save you from trusting a bad device. Just because your computer recognizes the card as roughly the capacity advertised does not mean that it actually has that much working memory. All of these cards showed up as 238 GB memory devices but only a small fraction of that was actually usable.

  I kept having problems with my new moto g6 phone, like not able to download apps or taking pictures that would save to my phone. I did factory reset to my phone and long story short could not believe my SD card was the cause of the problems. It's a fake card that I had the misfortune of purchasing, not only did I buy this for myself but also my 2 daughters, so now I'm out money for items that can't be used. I really can't tell anyone what to look for when purchasing this item to determine if it's real or not, but I do remember when I installed the card it said something about it will be slower... hope this helps

  I bought this for my nintendo switch lite in lu of a 256gb card figuring I could save $10 since I will not likely need the additional storage of a 256gn card. This seems to read fast but the write speed is significantly slower than the 64gb Ultra Extreme card it is replacing. The 64gb card is high performance however and the 200gb card is fast enough for my nintendo switch. This card should hold about 15 fullsize AAA games. I needed the extra space to download Borderlands and Mortal Combat and will have plenty of room with no forseeable need to expand memory again. Reasonable for the discount on price but the extra $10 will get you 56gb more and faster write speeds. I wouldn't use this for a camera or phone as the write speed seems a little slow/unreliable....but would work fine as backup storage on a laptop.

  It worked for about 15 seconds and all attempts to recover the card have been unacceptable.  The card is reported as corrupt by the phone, A format shows 20% complete before you start formatting and when it shows the format as complete, it still advises the card is corrupt. However it performs flawlessly in other devices. I have it in a Samsung tablet now and it works just fine there.  I'm going to advise that if you want to use this card in an S9 or S9+ make another choice of card.  I am going to put the blame on myself for this because it is, after all, a 1U card.  Buy a 3U card. I have confidence in all the SanDisk products so I can't give it a bad rating.

On my Linux computer the reported 32GB in dmesg but 5.7GB capacity in fdisk and when I tried to 'dd' onto them it hung at 5.7GB.Then I tried a Windows machine with the HP Disk Format tool which crapped out trying to partition the device just saying ""volume too big"" which I've never seen beforeEven when it did write on Linux, the speeds were more like 5MB/s - nothing like a Class 10 UHS 1 card should perform.Mine the font looks right and they even have unique serial numbers, although I see on the SD adapter what looks like a date code for 2018-04-20 (I got these on 2019-09-27).  I also noticed opening them was extremely hard (compared to other SanDisk packaging) the backing you peal off just ripped at the pull-tab so I had to destroy the bubble plastic to get the card out...also contributing to my suspicions as to the authenticity.  Usually the real SanDisk ones peal open quite easily.Amazon's customer service agreed that it sounded wrong and recommended I return them.

But once we figured this out it took and read it instantly. Highly recommend, especially for Wyze Cams, We purchased the 32 gb size after reading on the Wyze website that these cams will take up to 32 gb, however have also read some people purchasing bigger gb and it working, but for our cameras and our needs, these work great.

This brand is also an excellent choice when using it to hold games and data--for example, if you are soft modding a Nintendo 3DS for homebrew.

    It Crashed My Switch - Dangerous to Use
  
",1.0 ,Brandon,"Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2019","









  
  
    
  As soon as I inserted it into my Switch and turned it on, the Switch was non-responsive. I had done a system update prior to doing this, so my Switch was set up for using micro SD cards - no issue there. The screen stayed black and I had to do a hard reboot of it to make it cut back off. I let it sit for a while thinking it was just a coincidence, then I turned it back on and got the same thing. I turned it off again, took the card out, then turned it back on and luckily it still works. It DID, however, erase my saves during this ordeal. Luckily I have cloud saves enabled and was able to restore my save state.I had done some research on this item prior to purchasing it for my Switch, and it seems to have some solid reviews. Having said that, the product that I personally received straight from Amazon seems to be a cheap knock-off of the real thing. Before today, I didn't know that ""fake"" SD cards were a thing.The packaging seemed a bit ""off"" when it arrived in the mail. The front and back of the cardboard packaging was not lined up (pictured), and the imprints of the company logo are not lined up with the ink on the actual packaging. Looking at the plastic shell that it's in, you can tell that it wasn't pressed in a factory like other SD card holders. The last indicator, one that I didn't get a picture of before I opened it, was that the area over the SD card adaptor was ""bulged out"" and the lining around it was crinkled. You can still kind of tell from the fourth picture I included above - the top was like that before I opened it.I reached out to Amazon customer service about the issue, but they did not assist me other than offering a refund without having to return the original item. Due to their response to my claim, I don't think they will be looking into this issue further and as a result, you run the risk of damaging your Switch or losing your save states by purchasing this item. I'm sure some of this product are the real deal, but obviously there are some fakes mixed in with their shipments. Very disappointing.Update: Despite the agent I chatted with claiming he forwarded it to someone higher up and that they would be in touch with me to resolve the issue due to it almost bricking my system, no one ever contacted me. Do not trust a product because it is an ""Amazon's Choice"", and do not put your faith in their customer service. Product quality apparently doesn't matter to them.

  Notice: Review is subject to change if problems occur down the road. Never had an issue with Sandisk before, though.I checked online for images to compare, my 400GB card and packaging look legitimate. Buy from Amazon directly if there's a concern about hardware piracy. This 400GB model had Amazon Services Inc as the seller and was eligible for Prime so I'm certain it's authentic.I'm not alone in reporting that the FORMATTED capacity of the card is 366GB. These disks do tend to sell advertising the unformatted capacity.Took me a while to get the card  into the caddy on my Note9, but booting up the phone after installing, I had no problems accessing data I'd copied to it earlier - 1800 camera photos appear rather fast. I didn't run any professional benchmark tests but it's faster than the 256GB card I was using before when loading. Wow.Reading others' reviews, heating may be an issue. I only use the card for backup purposes but will keep an eye on it. Frequent/heavy use might be a concern, and given the tiny size of these cards, heating would become an issue.For $160, seems a good deal. Better than $260 for the same card elsewhere or even $360 for the 512GB version -- but there are times for the extra capacity that necessitate the cost. 400GB (or, rather, 366 formatted) is rather nice, especially for the snappier speed.

  I think this is a fairly priced microSD, and I recommend it to anybody looking to increase the storage capacity on their Nintendo Switch. I have to say one thing though before you buy if you plan on getting all your games digitally you should have at least 1tb because some games are 40 gbs or more, it will be a problem in the future. I recommend buying physical versions of the games you want so you only use up a gigabyte or two of space because it's all on the game card, so there's no need to download the whole game on the console.

  128 GB SDXC card is used for 5MP PTZ camera.  Easy to use and works well.  The card comes with the adapter which is nice.  The card is packed in a plastic with surrounding cardboard display hanger. I bought several other SanDisk cards.  One 64GB card for a 1080p camera and two more for 4K Dash Cams.  I recommend SanDisk over any other memory cards because they work and last - no video problems.

  It's only been 6 months since I purchased this card but it appears that it can write but not erase any of the files on it.  Also, I was only able to fill up about 40GB out of the 64 and now I can't do anything with the card.  Tried erasing the files and/or formatting via the phone or via a computer but even though it seems that the erasing is working, the files are still there and no more content can be written.  Many of the memories (pictures and videos) that we thought we captured are now lost.  I also tried to install some aps on the phone to verify the card but the apps are unable to read it

  I had this card put away for six months until needed. Upon using it the past few days it was acknowledged as a 200GB high-speed card (according to Windows), but was not preforming as such. I tested it on my Nintendo Switch and it did not recognize it as an SDXC card or allow downloads above 32GB. On my PC, it took extremely long to upload data onto the card (even when recognized as an SDXC) against a standard 128GB card by SanDisk I already own. After putting in data past 57 GB, the system did not show any data in the specific test folders. After attempting to add more into the same folder, it recognized that the data already existed, but could not be seen by Windows. Man, it feels bad losing $50 and never knowing until past the return period. Please check your products upon reception.

    Excellent SanDisk  400 GB SD CARD!!! A very detailed review.
  
",5.0 ,,"Reviewed in the United States September 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  I am writing my review about my SanDisk 400 GB SD Card that shows my personal experience with this card...Well, I am so excited because my SanDisk 400GB SD Card is a Genuine SanDisk card, not a fake (very relieved because I read in some of the 256gb reviews, some received a fake, but this is very, very rare).First thing I did was to format my card in my phone. It formatted fine and then the card was ready to use.Then I began adding files to it from my SD Card Reader with old my 128 GB SanDisk. I had 68 GB (mostly large audio files and video files) to copy to my new 400 GB, so I just added a few folders at a time and it took me a while to totally finish adding all of the 68 GB of files to my new SD card.This SanDisk card is so large so if you have lots of files to add, it may take a while to copy all of your files over to the new SD Card.If you want to just add a few files and start over with this card, then it will copy files quickly.For the reasonable price that this card is, I found it to be an excellent buy. Overall I recommend this SanDisk 400 GB SD Card.

  I saw there were many reviews about getting fake capacity cards.  I bought this direct from Amazon (no 3rd party) in Jan 2019.  the f3probe utility reported it is the correct capacity (59 GB or so for a 64GB card).The linux ""drive"" benchmark reported an average read of 18.9 MB/s and an average write of 16.5 MB/s with an average access time of 0.86 msec.I haven't used it other than that to comment on any other aspects, but it appears to be a legit Sandisk card and should therefore do whatever you expect of Sandisk cards.  The package claims to be enough for 1080p video, but 16.5 MB/s should be enough for 4K security cameras as well.

    This is not good for Roku or Pi-Hole use
  
",1.0 ,Tanya Riley,"Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this card for a Linux Pi-Hole project.  The application would constantly hang and I'd have to manually unplug the Pi to reboot the Pi.  A couple days later, it would be hung again.  I bought a Samsung Evo, installed the application from scratch and haven't had problems since.  I decided to reformat this card and use it in my Roku 4.  (Since my roke started complaining about needing more memory to support the number of channels I have installed on the device).  Plugged into the Roku and the Roku performs its own format of the card and begins to make use of it.  About a week later, my Roku isn't responsive (hung at the initial Roku logo boot screen) and the Roku device is super hot.  Pulled the power cord and rebooted the Roku.  Few days later, same result.  Have since replaced that card with a Samsung Evo.I suspect this little card would work fine for a digital camera where there is only occasional IO.  But it doesn't work well in practice in a device where there is a pretty constant read/write operations needed.  Regardless, I tossed it.  I don't want any more frustration from this damned card.

    May 2020 - My SanDisk 64GB MicroSD Card is Super Slow on File Transfers/No Phone Use (UPDATE)
  
",4.0 ,Jerry Davis,"Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  I attempted to use this card in my phone and after five different attempts, gave up.  I tried every file format, used SanDisks own FAT32 app to try FAT32, tried every method I could find on the Internet, and this card would NEVER mount on my android phone.  File transfers were maxed at about 4MB/sec from my Thinkpad to the card, too.  In contrast, my old 8GB card transfers files at around 30MB/sec in the same port and adapter.  So this SanDisk card is either a bogus pirated knockoff, or just a bad card.  It also does not have the same official seal on the back that my 8GB card has.  I'm going to keep it for additional storage in my Thinkpad, but for my phone and the main purpose I bought it, fail.  I would not buy again.UPDATE - I put the card into my wife's phone and it mounted immediately and works perfectly.  So apparently this is a driver issue with my phone.  Good card for most, apparently.

  Card stopped working after only a few months. My phone stopped recognizing it and so did my computer. I tried reformatting it, but that process kept failing. I contacted Sandisk customer support and they ask a bunch of questions to narrow down your model and the serial number. I guess they put out a lot of very similar items. They give me an RMA # and a label, but won't send a new item until they receive the old one.Well, the kicker is that I sent this thing in over 2 weeks ago and it's either delayed or lost in the mail. The USPS tracker hasn't been updated in a week.  I let customer service know, but they insist they need to wait until the item is received back to send out a replacement. I ask what happens if it's lost in the mail. They reply saying they need to receive the item back. Terrific.It costs them pennies to manufacture this thing and a couple of dollars to ship it. I'll give them a chance to redeem themselves, but they want to stick to a process rather than accommodate a customer that has been without full use of his phone for weeks, even though he did everything they asked

  I've been having problem after problem with getting all of my Hi-res music to play on my Fiio x5iii. It supports two 256GB micro-SD cards. As I've learned the hard way, a fake card is produced by taking a lower storage capacity card and re-coding the software into tricking the respective device that it contains more storage. These cards work fine until they reach over 12 GB of storage. I eliminated every other possible cause (firmware updates, cables, etc.) of the errors. When over 12GB of files are added to the card, all of the sudden the software on my PC and DAP start having errors and everything freezes and becomes unplayable. Once I read how counterfeits are made it all clicked. It it were simply a defective chip then it wouldn't work at all, yet it works perfectly below roughly 12GB.

I used a card tester program from vconsole and verified that it is indeed a 64GB SD card.  However, it is advertised on the packaging as read speeds up to 100 MB/s and write speeds being lower.  The program I used to test it was only able to achieve a write speed of 18 MB/s and a read speed of 21 MB/s.

  We have been using this card in one of our IP cameras and it has worked ok with no problems.  However, I wanted to switch this card to a different camera where I needed more storage and swap the two cards.  So, I copied the files from the other camera's card which was a 64GB to the computer, which took only minutes to do.  That card is a Sandisk Extreme UHS speed Class 3 (U3), video speed Class 30 (V30) and Class 10 for 4K UHD and full HD video that claims read speeds up to 90mb/sec and write at 60mb/sec.  While it may not have been quite that high, it was still very fast.When I then went to copy those files to this card is where I found out just how bad it is.  I started the copy around 9am and it is still going at 93% complete now at 12:30p.  I watch the progress and at most times windows is showing the write speed in kb/sec, with limited times being in mb/sec.  It frequently drops to 0kb/sec and stays there a while, then continues.  The speed is up and down, but never very fast (the highest I've seen is maybe 10mb/sec, but it doesn't stay there more than an instant.)  I'm not an expert on performing detailed speed testing and all that, but it just seems very bad in real life use.  Card is directly in the computer's card reader; I have no idea what the specs are, but the other card is much faster.  The performance is so bad I'm thinking I may purchase a better card and not use this one any more.

  With a 32GB card you get 32GB.  With  a 64GB card you get 64GB.  And so on.  This is not a 200GB sdcard.  It is much smaller.  SanDisk Marketing is lying about the size of the  card, which should make everyone cautious about quality.  This looks to be made from rejects of larger media -- probably 256GB -- that failed checks, but could be sold for a more modest size.  That would be acceptable, but lying about one thing ALWAYS means they're lying about something even more important.Sure enough, I get tonnes of SD card errors with this.

  Others have adequately covered the set-up aspects, so I'll skip that part of my T45 review. After leaving my dogs and my home in the care of neighbors that I trusted for a week, I was shocked to find that I COULDN'T trust them. This camera was then purchased for surveillance, and it has given me a feeling of security again. The menu and the manual were VERY easy to understand for setting up the camera. I have the camera tied about 7ft high to a post under my deck - yesterday I got excellent color pics of a delivery person, and then B&W pics of myself taking out the trash early this morning. And the only evidence that it's taking a photo is that the blue lights are visible - only if you are looking AT the camera. I now plan to purchase another one for INSIDE my home!

  This 512 GB SD card tripled the “disk” storage of my MS Surface 3 for a fraction of the cost of a new hard drive and doesn’t use a USB port like a portable drive.  The newer laptops are relying on Cloud storage and the standard hard drive is a 256 GB SSD. The SD card reader is probably the next thing to go after the Ethernet port and DVD drive are gone as laptops slim down, but for now it’s an inexpensive solution.

  Need a good offsite backup for my personnel PC at home. I was looking into Blu-Ray writable drives but the speed was crap. Besides an expensive tape system my other option was flash storage. My problem with flash is many usb drives will give you good initial speed and then after 30 seconds the write speed will crater. SanDisk has been known for years for making quality SD Cards so I decided to give this one a shot. After backing up my drive I copied 100GB data to the card. At first the write speed was 70 MB/sec after about  a minute it settled down to 53 MB/sec. The transfer went on for about 20 minutes and the card held steady at 50~ MB/sec . I for a 128GB SD card the size of my pinky nail I'm satisfied. I think some people who don't see good speed aren't using a UHS-I reader to go along with the card. I ordered a SanDisk ImageMate PRO for $22 (thanks Amazon Warehouse) for that purpose.

I went as far as purchasing a “Ultra SD Card” upgrade but that too didn’t work. On top of that the camera kept making this “powering off” chime and it wouldn’t stop. Rear camera did not come on it was just a dud.Supposedly the camera is preprogrammed but the continuous powering off chime, plugged into my cigarette lighter, the brain damage to set up was too much.

  I purchased the SanDisk Ultra 32GB (SDSQUAR-032G-GN6MA). The card I received is the one advertised; read/write speed is close to 98MB/s. I'm using this card in my raspberry pi 3 b v1.2, and the card's performance allows for the best pi performance. I have a SanDisk Ultra Pro 32GB (SDSQUB3-032G-ANCMA) card is my raspberry pi 4 b, and it runs noticeably slower than my pi 3.The SanDisk Ultra (SDSQUAR-032G-GN6MA) not being optimized for video reading makes this card much more suited for my usage. This card was made in Malaysia and the build quality is superb.The SanDisk Ultra Pro (SDSQUB3-032G-ANCMA) is optimized for video reading and does not perform well on my pi. It claims 130MB/s, but I was getting worse performance than the other card. This card was made in China and the build quality is sub-par, and there are noticeable defects. I bought this card at a local Target and it's not actually sold anywhere else.Overall, very happy with my purchase. This card (SDSQUAR-032G-GN6MA) is well made and works well for my purposes.

  Good fast access - I use this to expand the very paltry memory on the Nintendo Switch, and it works very well for that purpose.  Note that because it's a rather spacious card, the Switch will require a system update (which is automatic) so it can map the entire card.No issues with it at all.  I have Breath of the Wild on here for example, and no slowdowns or trouble loading.  Sure, I bet there's a small slowdown when compared to the onboard memory, but it's so minor that I don't notice it at all.Even better - price wise it absolutely wins over the Nintendo-themed cards that are offered for sale.  A 128gb card at my local B&M was the same price as this card.It's a good product and does great with the Switch.  I like it a lot.

  Bought 128GB and it's been working for about a year.  Unfortunately, the card stopped working and I'm dealing with manufacturer's warranty process. Apparently these A1 versions are not recommended for Nintendo Switch as it requires higher read and writes. The recommend cards are the specific ones made for the Switch and models A2 and above. The price difference is not much and I would invest in that rather losing data. Something to consider there are options for data recovery during the time of purchase which is also a few bucks or simply subscribe to Nintendo Switch Online which I did. It saves my game data on the cloud and not having to wait for process for data recovery. Overall it's time and money just choose what suits you.

  I ordered a 256GB card for the Black Friday 2019 Sale. I finally got around to trying to use it in my Nintendo Switch about a month later and had nothing but troubles. I ran some tests on it and it would only verify about 29GB of the card. The rest all showed up as corrupt. I've never had any problems with SanDisk cards in general or cards from Amazon until now. To their credit, Amazon told me to pitch the bad one and are sending me a new one. If I get a good one in a couple of days I'll either re-review or update this one.EDIT:OK, so I received my replacement today and ran it through its paces with H2testw. It took about 4 hours to make it completely through a full write+verify cycle and it completed without the first error. Not bad for a 256GB card. This is what I expect from SanDisk. I used a magnifying glass and went over the two cards closely. I can't find any difference in texture, color, fonts used, nothing. As near as I can tell, these are exactly the same cards. If the bad one isn't legit, then it's a darned good knock-off. I'll leave it up to you guys. Fake or a lemon? I have no idea. All I know is that I checked it out in time to fall under the return policy and Amazon stoff by it. They sent me a brand new one that appears flawless and I didn't even have to return the old one, not that I could use it for anything anyway, but it's nice not to have to hassle with it.So, I'm bumping my review back up to a 4. It would've been a 5, but there was some trouble, but Amazon made it right and SanDisk seems to have come through with this second card. My only suggestion would be to not poke around when you order a card from anyone. Check it out with H@testw ASAP, to confirm that it works up to the correct capacity. If not return it. Also, don't mess with things that aren't sold by/shipped by Amazon. You're just asking for trouble and you can't be saving that much. If you are, that should be a red flag.

It did need to be formatted, but I had the choice to format either for removable storage or permanent storage.I can't comment easily on the picture quality of the SD card itself, because the Kindle lets me choose a setting for picture quality of movies and TV shows, so the quality is determined by the Kindle before storing the movies or TV shows on the SD card.  I also can't comment on the versatility of the SD card, because the Kindle automatically moves items from its own internal storage to the SD card.

  I'm using this in my S8 Active and have had no issues so far. The benchmark I ran have me a read speed of 70 MB and write speed of 36 MB. Nothing special but performs well enough.Pictures are quick to take and videos have no issues. Playing music is fine and even running emulators aren't a problem. Although I wouldn't feel comfortable with having this card being formatted as internal storage. A UHS-3 class card is better suited for that.Don't expect any heavy use (Like 4K 60 FPS on this) but for basic smartphone/tablet use, it'll be fine.

  I bought this back in February 2019, and as of June 2020, it is working flawlessly.  This is quite a bargain price (around $31) for a high-capacity and very fast microSD card and it performs as well as cards 2-3 times the cost. The size of 200GB is unusual, but is very high. I use it in my new Dell laptop as a second ""hard drive,"" since my primary HD is a solid-state 256GB, not an ideal size for a single drive. I use the Sandisk as my second HD, which contains all my documents, music, pictures, videos, etc. I expect it to last many years to come, being solid state and no moving parts, but I still back it up regularly--as everybody should do (especially with precious photos, videos, and important documents). This is highly recommended as an extremely great value from a highly rated company: Sandisk.

  Had for a few months so far, good for the Nintendo Switch. I originally got this in anticipation of playing LA Noire, but in game when I'm driving the car sometimes the environment doesn't load fast enough and it looks like I'm driving in the sky. I don't know if that has to do with the read speed on this card not being good enough for their optimal requirements, or if it's just the game. This card says up to 100MB/s read speed though, and LA Noire requires 60MB/s minimum. But for all my other games, like Splatoon 2, this card is great. Seems authentic, I've used about 40GB so far with no error codes. Got mine from Amazon as the seller.

  I use a LOT of microSD cards, game cameras, smart phones, single board computers (rpi), data logging.  The SanDisk microSD's hold up well.  No microSD card will last forever, especially if you do a ton of reads and writes to them but I like the SanDisk for 2 reasons.  First, I have yet to have one completely fail on me and I can't say that about most of the competition.  Second, they are fast.  When I am using them for data logging or game cameras the write times are important and the SanDisk cards are up to the challenge.  All too often I have tried another card because I wanted to see how they would do and I find that their claims for read/write speed is no where near what the card actually does.  SanDisk microSDs match their stated performance.

  The chip is fine. Not amazing, just fine.But the packaging is ridiculously hard to open. I know it's a cliche that small electronics are hard to open, but this thing takes the prize for most maddening package. First you need to cut open the non-tearable outer cardboard. Then you need to extract the chip and the adapter from the tiny inner hard-plastic packaging. No matter where you cut, it's never close enough. You cut, and everything's still stuck inside. Of course, if you cut too close with scissors, you risk damaging the tiny micro-SD card. In the end, I had to use an Exacto knife to carefully trace along the edges to get it out. There's no reason for it to be so difficult. Come on, San Disk.And what happened to the little plastic clamshell case these things use to come in? The chip is so tiny and easy to lose. A plastic case would have been helpful. Instead, after chewing and tearing cutting through all of the packaging, all there are inside are the chip and the adaptor. No case. I've taken to scotch-taping the chip to an index card so I don't lose it. There's no reason for that. Again: come on, San Disk.

I bought this mainly to check my cleaning job on and condition of gun barrels.  Does a reasonably nice job imaging a bore.  The camera fits into a 22 cal. bore, but the accessories/attachments don't.  The image of the 22 is certainly useful without the attachments though.I read on a forum that gun bore viewing is best if you have a ""reflector"" of some sort 2 inches ahead of the camera.  This unit comes with such an attachment.  It also comes with a probe and a hook -- all of which attach solidly to the camera to prevent losing them while in use.  I can see using this in drains, walls, engines, etc.You can capture video and still images with either your smart phone or your computer.  It comes with three different USB plugs for versatility.I can't speak of durability as I just received this yesterday.  I will say I already have $20 worth of fun and use out if it.My only criticism is that the instructions are very thin -- typical of Chinese products; however, it really isn't hard to figure out how everything works.

  I bought this card to use in my dashcam. It had a 32gb max capacity, and this works perfectly. Considering it is simply writing video cards, the speeds are perfect for my needs. If you are looking for a micro SD card for something like a Nintendo Switch, I would recommend going with the SanDisk Extreme for the faster read/write speeds. Over the years, the prices of expandable memory has gone down a lot as the max capacities made have increased. I spend only around $8 for a 32gbs with an adapter, and that would have been unheard of even 5 years ago. SanDisk is the best in the game for SD cards and this furthers my belief in that.

  I needed one for my phone and one as a backup for my laptop, something small that I could carry in my wallet while traveling.  The speeds are good for the tiny size.  The 4k read/write is significantly quicker than a portable hard drive and will aid speed for large syncs of many small files.The new A1 rating is for IOPS (input output operations per second) which is to help with application performance. A1 is with minimum ratings of 1500 IOPS read and 500 for write.  The 4k speed numbers are many times faster than the Samsung Evo select. I am a fan of both companies, so just saying for comparison.  These numbers will help for sure with transferring many small files in comparison to lesser models.I tested both, they came in the typical sealed red and grey packaging.  Both are legit SanDisk products, purchased from seller Amazon.Thank you

",4.0 ,Roger JamesTop Contributor: Photography,"Reviewed in the United States July 2, 2018","









  
  
    
  SanDisk makes very reliable Sd and microsd cards that perform very well. So far each card used has worked well and not having proper test equipment can't verify it performs exactly as advertised. I think everyone has various SD cards that break apart or perform less than expected. So far every SanDisk card used so far has held together and not been an issue. Reliability does count and I feel comfortable using these cards for any or all my cameras. There could be better cards out there but reliability is what this card stands out.and I have no hesitation to try a new model when they release a faster card.

  It has some limitations in that the hard drive is quite small.  I know that many folks use cloud-based storage for many things, but I wanted a bit more of available space on the 2-in-1 Acer.

  I bought two SanDisk Ultra 128 GB SanDisk SD-Cards recently, and two 64 GB Ultra cards in 2014. On first use, only one of the 128 GB cards was working, and neither of the 64 GB cards worked. When I say a card wasn't working I mean that when I plugged it into my W10 PC (using the SanDisk adapter), the computer could not see it, or took many minutes and attempts to see it, then announced there were defects on the card. When the latter happened I would hit ""Scan and Repair"", but the repair never succeeded. I also tried to format it with the SanDisk routine that I downloaded, but it couldn't do a thing. Finally I tried several times to load the cards in my two portable music players, but the players could not see them. Meanwhile, cards from another manufacturer worked every time.  What's going on, SanDisk? This doesn't seem consistent with your good reputation.  Got an automatic response from SanDisk, 3 days later - see Comments. But it's totally useless: no apology, no suggestion about what might have gone wrong, no offer to compensate me for hours of wasted time. Instead, they want me to waste more time calling them back, and supposedly helping them out. Well, ""No Thanks SanDisk - you have given me zero incentive to help you! You must know about this problem already because there are a lot of reviews like mine, and amazon must be getting plenty of returns."" (A little Customer Care could have easily convinced me, but SanDisk totally failed in that department!)

  Whenever you look at a product that uses memory cards, a compatibility guide should be the first thing you examine. At the top of every guide is a SanDisk product. There's a reason for that. I have 3 of these cards (Nintendo Switch, Samsung Note 9, Microsoft Surface Go), and they've worked flawlessly for a long time.I'm not saying people can't have issues with SanDisk cards. Yes, I have gotten a bad card out of the package before, but it was only once, and I have bought dozens of memory cards for various needs. In that case, SanDisk support was swift and easy, getting me a replacement next day with a prepaid return label to send back the defective card.

  I won the counterfeit ""lottery"" and actually got a genuine card! (Yes, this is a known issue with SD cards at Amazon). Anyway...This works just fine in a Nintendo Switch. It recognizes the entire capacity of the card. Upon inserting it, it will prompt for an update, which is grabbing the exFAT driver and license.For the techies, the format that Nintendo Switch uses is exFAT filesystem with 128kb sectors.Transferring your existing files is easy if you're coming from an existing SD card in your Switch. You just copy the contents of your old SD card's root to some folder on a PC, then format this new 400GB microSDXC card either in the Switch or on a PC (exFAT with 128kb sectors), then copy the root contents of the old SD card onto this new one.The 400GB card (as of this review) is the best bang-for-buck card on the market right now, considering the only size bigger is 512GB and that card goes for 4 times the price.

  I thought 200gb would have been more than enough for the lifetime of my Nintendo Switch but apparently not. I decided to just upgrade to the 400gb so I won’t have to worry about space on the Switch for a while.I transferred all of my files through my computer and although it took a while, it transferred fairly easily.I’ve used Sandisk flash drives and memory cards for years now and have always appreciated the quality of product they put out. I wouldn’t likely use a card this big for my mirrorless camera unless I was going to shoot a lot of 4K but normally I don’t like having large capacity cards with too many of my photos on them.So far it’s worked great and I think the price was actually pretty reasonable so it’s never been a problem for me to hesitate Sandisk products.

    Tip to make it faster when it is slow
  
",3.0 ,Jeffrey Baker,"Reviewed in the United States September 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  In my Dell PC I was getting a slow transfer speed with SD cards. It was reading at 10MB/s to 18 MB/s. But the card is advertised at 98MB/s. This is with an SD Card Reader built into the Dell PC. I tried the following steps:1. Disabled Antivirus - Still 10MB/s to 18MB/s2. Dell Website - Updated Realtek Card Reader Driver for my Model: Still 10MB/s to 18MB/s3. Device Manager > Disk Drives > SDHC Card > Policies > Better Performance: 12MB/s to 18MB/s4. Realtek website - Updated Card Reader Driver: 25MB/s to 28MB/sSo the answer was to download and update the Realtek Card Reader driver directly from Realtek's website. This increased the average speed a lot but it is still slower than it should be. The next thing to try is to buy a USB SD card reader and try it in a high speed USB port and see if the read speeds are faster.Oh, by the way, step 3 above is potentially dangerous. Instead of leaving it on ""Better Performance"" you probably want to keep it at ""Quick Removal"" otherwise you might lose data. I think any speed increase with ""Better Performance"" could possibly be fake anyway because Windows might say that it is done transferring but it could still be transferring data in the background.

    The best and biggest microSD you can get

  It may say 400gb, but upon inserting it into my Nintendo Switch it comes out to 366gb.Even with the disparity between listed capacity and demonstrable capacity, it is the LARGEST microSD you can get as of right now (Nov 26, 2018). It is actually baffling holding this miniscule memory card in my hand. My desktop hard drive from 10 years ago is literally hundreds of times larger in mass, but only 100gb larger (≈25%!!) in storage capacity. This thing can hold almost half a terabyte and I could fit it up my nose, it's otherworldly.I noticed it loads games slightly slower than the internal storage on Nintendo Switch, but the difference is basically negligible. Tested with Fortnite and Warframe and completely forgot about the difference in load times after a few minutes when I stopped paying attention, though with the latter it does use a lot of ""asset streaming"" in particular textures, which will appear blurry for a noticably longer time upon appearing on screen. Again, a negligible sacrifice all things considered.I cannot recommend this microSD enough. This is *the* microSD to get, and will be until SanDisk or Samsung or some other manufacturer finally gets 512gb working.

  Summation: Card was affordable and I liked the additional storage on my phone. However, both both cards have failed after 2 years of 'normal' use. It is probably easier to just buy a new SD card and move on.====I purchased two of these SD cards in 08-2018 to expand the storage in two Moto G6 phones. One card was more ""heavily"" utilized as I moved what apps I could (Facebook, Fitbit, Instagram) to SD storage, as well as music from Amazon. The other SD card was not used as much and was just there in case more storage was needed.I had issues with my phone that drove me to reset the phone and reformat the SD card several times. After the last reload, I was advised not use the SD card and that was determined to be the problem.I completed an RMA on the card. Honestly, it would have been easier to buy a new SD card rather than go through the RMA process. SanDisk support verifies the card is dead with you. Then you mail it back to them and they send you a new one a few weeks later. I appreciate the warranty support of course.Overall, it is a good product. You should just expect to buy a replacement or upgrade within a few years apparently.

  I've used ScanDisk products for many years and most have been great.This one was not.I copied 225 GIG of data over to it from varying sources. This took quite a while.  It was not the speediest card I've worked with.  Again, I've owned many.  This was a slow card in comparison.The plan was to then go thru all the files and make sense of everything instead of having my data on 4-8 different cards.  It was supposed to be a simple solution.Once all the data was in place, and it showed that it was in place, I was to get to work the next day.I fire up my computer, insert the card and poof!  NOTHING.  A message pops up stating that the card needs to be formatted. HUH?  I do a number of test, nothing.  I try different operating systems on different units I work with.  Typically a Linux machine fixes everything but not this time.  So I then run a disk evaluation and it says again, that this card needed to be formatted and that it had 32 MEG of memory.Yes, MEG, not GIG.I then contact Amazon support, which was awesome by the way via Chat.They didn't even flinch and said to return it for a full refund.That should be enough of a red flag to just avoid this card.Just get a BIG USB stick or an external drive for data solutions.  If this would be for a camera, tablet, phone or whatever, just get a 200 / 256.  They work fine.This one did not.

  Ever since I installed it, the phone gave me error message saying it was not going to have a satisfactory speed, this was my phone's message... That message appeared for a few days until it suddenly disappeared.  Then, my pictures started having problems... Randomly they would get ruined, with lines in the middle or you would just see half of the picture, they would get broken.  In thumbnail size in my gallery they seemed normal, but once I opened them they would open with the defects.

  This is a nice Micro SD card to have. I am using it in a wireless security camera which is located outside. As such, the micro SD card does not seem to have any issues working in cold temps. I've been using it for about a month now where the camera is constantly creating the video recordings 24 hours a day. Thus, I believe that this is good solid product to have if you are looking for a Micro / Mini SD card for basic use.

  Man for the price, it just doesn’t get any better. I am using this on the new S20 Ultra and it can handle what I typically shoot at with no issue.Keep in mind, for a phone of this caliber, there are a few caveats with this memory card - namely the read and write speeds. It cannot handle 4K60P or 8K, for this you may need a card label as an “A2” which is meant for superior read and write speeds and fast enough for transferring apps and running applications right from the card.However, as a storage option for pictures or videos that are at 4K30, I had absolutely no issues. The card can keep going and I had no problems having it format inside the phone and then within seconds I was able to backup pictures.It also works great for the Nintendo Switch, so if you need substantial storage for cheap, this is your card.At the time I purchased the card, I believe I got it on a deal for $59.99, they can occasionally go on deals, be on the lookout!

  I'm always a little sceptical about micro sd cards, since there are so many counterfeit ones on the market. As you may already know, some disreputable sellers modify lower capacity cards (like 32 or 64 gig) to report as higher capacity ones. It'll look like a real card, but once you write more data to it than it's true capacity, it quietly overwrites data instead. This one, however, tested perfect!I used the free F3 utility to verify the card. It wrote the full 400 gigs of data to the card, then read it back and verified it as good. It got just over 17MB/s for writing, just over 13MB/s read. Since the card is rated 10MB/s read/write, this card outperforms its class by a small amount. I'll probably end up getting another for my tablet.

    The 400gb Ultra is the best value microsd there is right now. Compare to 256gb high endurance
  
",5.0 ,,"Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  For dashcams and other continuous loop recordings: Sandisk markets a ""high endurance"" 256gb card @ $52, but it is a terrible deal compared to this 400gb SanDisk Ultra. The main selling point of a high endurance card is1) it can take additional writes. This card can too since it also has storage space above 256gb, except unlike the 256gb card you can access the additional storage space from the get go, which is hugely important to increase the look-back period of your dashcam. 256gb is the current max storage for high endurance cards, if you want more storage you either have to periodically back up data to a hard drive or... you could just get the 400gb Ultra.2) Some durability features. SD cards have zero moving parts, any condition that would destroy the Ultra would likely destroy the equipment containing it. There is only a narrow survivability delta, if any, where the high endurance would survive conditions that the ultra doesn't.3) Warranty. The high endurance only offers 2 years warranty compared to 10 years on the ultra, but in the warranty terms the Ultra does not cover failures due to use in applications like dash cams. This is BS as all SD cards are already warranty-limited by write cycles. Write cycles are write cycles, regardless of whether they occur in a dash cam or a normal camera.  Nevertheless this warranty is unnecessary as a) failures of legit microsds are extremely rare even in ""high endurance"" scenarios, and b) the costs of cashing in the warranty likely exceed the value of the replacementIn terms of compatibility, many pieces of equipment will claim to have a limit of say 128gb but take this card just fine.In terms of write speed, a peak of 100MegaBytes/s is plenty for most consumer grade cameras. I've used it in an action camera and it can take sustained 4K 170 Megabits/s video (170 megabits = 20 MegaBytes) no problem.TLDR/Bottom line: If you can afford it and if you plan on using the card in a scenario where you might possibly, at some point need maximum storage, this is the option that provides the best value.

  I generally only buy SanDisk memory cards in the hopes that they are reliable and I will not have any card failures. Unfortunately, these quality control issues also affect SanDisk so this review is simply a data point to record that.UPDATE 2019-10: Replacement card works just fine.

Since I always wonder if the micro-to-full SDHC card adapter may be a failure point... on my laptop I tried multiple additional adapters as well as the microSD directly in a card reader - all to the same result (unable to format - screenshot attached). So this is really just to record a single SanDisk dead-on-arrival data point. Fortunately Amazon quickly processed a replacement for me, so looking forward to that!

I was seeing max write speeds peaking at 10MB/s and frequently less than 1MB/sec.  But then I looked closer...  The problem is the way that it is formatted from the factory.  The thing to understand about a File System is that it is a SYSTEM.  there are a bunch of interlocking pieces in that system all of which potentially affect the speed.  Especially the way that the flash disk is formatted.When I reformatted the flash disk to use a native format instead of the factory format, my disk speed jumped way up.  I was seeing write speed bursting to over 100MB/sec and sustained writes of about 75MB/sec.  with sustained reads at a solid 100MB/sec.Very happy with this 128GB flash disk.

  I got this so I could play non-stop music in my car. It holds all of my music from my computer, (which is about 240 artist and I think maybe about 1500 songs), and it's not even half full yet. I still have plenty of room to load more song. I put my usb input on shuffle and the music just keeps playing without commercials or talk. I love it! I haven't tried videos. i just got the card for my mp3 player and my car. I'm not going to watch videos while I'm trying to drive anyway.

    Failed during first testing!

  First off, I've never had a SanDisk product fail on me except once, and that was a Compact Flash Card that was counterfeit. I know that Western Digital has purchased SanDisk now, but I've also had nothing from Western Digital fail on me either. Any item can have a defect, but this SanDisk MicroSD card had 4 errors before I stopped the test. I just find it strange, It could possibly be a fake, which is what I think it is. Whenever I buy memory cards online now, I always test it using a free program called Check Flash, and I would recommend that to anyone who does the same. Better to test it than assume it's good, and have it fail on you and you lose data which happened to me with the aforementioned Compact Flash Card. If you want to possibly avoid this issue entirely, than buy your memory cards a places like Best Buy, Staples, or Office Depot etc. If you want to see the failed test, see attached screen shots. Hope this helps someone! Good Luck, and BUYER BEWARE!

  UPDATE:Amazon was quick to send a replacement, and the replacement worked fine (25-30MB/s write speed, ~85 MB/s read speed).Adding one star for the fast replacement.—-Although there’s no guarantee or surefire way to tell whether this was a fake or simply a defective card (defects happen, just like with any other products), unfortunately it seems to happen quite often with these microSD cards.Now, whenever I purchase a microSD card, and before actually using it, I run a program called “h2testw”. What that program does is write a bunch of files to the card until it’s completely full, and then verify whether it can still read those files afterwards.When I tested this card, the first giveaway was the write speed...The program was registering a whopping 1.3 GBytes/sec (YES, GigaBytes!), as if this was an nvme ssd :POf course once it was done writing, all of the read verification failed :(So, hopefully y’all have better luck out there, but in my case, this card was completely unusable.

  I have bought so many of these cards and I use them for every electronic that will take them. There's one for every single phone I've ever owned that would use one as storage. And, they all still work! I use an adapter to go through them, mainly for all the photos I've taken over the years. I should put them all on one disk. But sometimes, it's fun to just put a disk in and be surprised at what I find there. It's always a walk down memory lane. They've become even more special to me, because many have pictures of my father on them. He always hated having one taken. He passed away eight years ago, and it's so nice to still have those memories of him available, and feel quite certain that those disks and pictures will last for years to come. I'm sure I will back them up somewhere else soon, but I haven't had a SanDisk card let me down, as of yet. I'm so thankful to have these little gems and highly recommend them to any and everyone!

Since today was the last day to return the card, I thought, I should check to make sure its not DOA or a fake one. Passed authenticity test by 2 applications (Flash drive tester 1.14 and h2testw_1.4) but writing and reading speeds are very low. Don't stand the 'grade' given by Sandisk.

    Issues connecting to computers and died in a short period, and slowish, but worked ok when it worked
  
",2.0 ,John Watsom,"Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2019","









  
  
    
  This card died on me after a rather short period of time. I was disappointed. It had to be destroyed in order to protect my data, since nothing could be deleted. This seems to be an issue with flash memory running out of read/write cycles, but this should not have happened in so short a period. It should have lasted many years.I realized the card was dead when files kept disappearing that it was not copying files, and then using many computers both mac and pc, and multiple card readers including the one that is built into the mac and one built into my pc laptop as well, I was unable to even get it formatted, leading me to the conclusion the card was dead.It also has an extremely hard time getting it to connect to my computer and copy files (when it worked out of the package), but copying files worked fine when it was in the phone (until it died). I tried many SD readers. I tried a Samsung 512GB micro sd with no problems at all, but this SanDisk 400GB micro sd card had constant problems copying files using many sd readers.I also found it to be rather slow when compared to the U3 card that I recently got from Samsung that is 512GB, which I got to replace this dead card.Overall, I wouldn't recommend this card, because you can get a 512GB today from the Samsung site for a similar price that I paid for this card, and it's not very fast for the size (although usable), and the issues getting it to connect to a computer was the greatest hassle that seems to be unique to this card.

  I bought this 400GB card to store music for my DAP. Upon getting it, I fired up h2testw and tested it. There was 366GB (GiB?) of exFAT formatted space on the card. It all tested OK. 366GiB is 392GB, so I suspect the discrepancy is just the labelling.Through my Thinkpad T420's PCIe-connected SD card reader, I was able to get completely stable 46MB/s write and 80MB/s read throughout the entire test (like, zero speed fluctuations at any point, which I was rather impressed with). I suspect my reader is limited because of the weirdly precise 80.0MB/s upper limit, so I would have gotten something like 93MB/s read like other reviewers if I used a better reader.Overall, great card, and staggering capacity for this price ($85) and speed that won't take you hours and hours to fill up. Just make sure to get the one sold/shipped by Amazon to avoid getting fakes, and use h2testw to test any SD cards you buy just in case.

  I bought this to put into my phone so I could have the freedom to throw in whatever games, movies, pictures, etc I want. Having owned a Nexus 4 which was locked in at 16 GB, I've been rather cramped in storage. Thankfully the Razer 2 recognizes up to 2TB SD cards if I'm not mistaken, but the 366GB capacity this card gives me after formatting will more than suffice. All buyers should make themselves aware that storage devices need to use part of their own memory to build the file system for the device to find the data on the card, so you will always have less than the advertised capacity(see the fine print on devices that says ""actual capacity may be less""), at least with today's technology.Had a strange issue with Android's OS reading the card. For some inexplicable reason it reports the card as having 512 GB capacity under the storage settings. Thankfully, when I connect the phone to my PC in data transfer mode, the PC reports the proper formatted capacity of 366 GB, so it SHOULD be a legitimate card. It made me wonder if I had gotten a fake card before I plugged it into the PC, since counterfeiters commonly hack lower capacity cards to report a higher capacity than is actually on the card. With that in mind you can understand why I might a hacker meant to write 400 GB to this card but forgot they set their program to write 512 instead, or something of the sort. The average user assumes the card must be legitimate if it say's it has the amount advertised. This is not the case, and the device using such a card may wind up losing data because it's trying to write to memory that's not actually there. By the time the user figures out it's a fake, the counterfeiter's account on the store is usually shut down. Thankfully my card seems to be legitimate.

  This is the one my Sony video camera requires, and it really is a perfect match.  Also works well with my LG Stylo phone and Fire 10 tablet.  I also have a couple I use to hold the operating systems of my laptops on, just an added bit of security should the laptops grow legs (at which point the built-in drive ""C"" boots just enough in the BIOS to notify me of where it is before shutting back down again as if broken).  For the camera, it records 1290x1024 HD for 65 hours and 30 minutes or so (with studio-stereo sound quality), so I will never really run out of room no matter what single-camera project I decide to take on.  It worked well in the unusually hot and humid weather we had here recently, I will update  with winter performance if that differs (I don't expect it will).On my tablet, I downloaded all the movies ad TV shows I own that are on Amazon's cloud, as well as shifted all apps able over to it to free up internal storage, and I still have most of the space available to store even more.  I don't normally keep movies on my phone, but the apps transferred over to the chip actually now perform better, as does the phone now that it has more room to work with for things like push-updates to the operating system and the inevitable electronic ""paperwork"" and eBooks for school (and a few games to keep from getting bored in the doctor's waiting area, etc.).

  This card became corrupted while I was taking a video with my smartphone I believe, but after that I couldn't format it or even delete anything from the card. Luckily I could copy and read from it still. I won't be using this brand in the future. Google this card and search for can't format or cannot delete files and this card 64gb comes up quite a bit. I bought it direct from Amazon, not 3rd party. It is not fake. I think they have a problem with these.

    Great card for The Nintendo switch
  
",5.0 ,Yitzhak,"Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2018","









  
  
    
  I bought the 200GB memory card for $40 and I sometimes see it for even cheaper. At the $40 price point or lower, I highly recommend this card for every switch owner. If you buy game cartridges then you'll never run out of space with this card. Most games i have on cartridge don't require much space on the card other than the save data and maybe a few MBs. As for downloadable games it can vary quite a bit. Most first party Nintendo games aren't that big; I believe the biggest first party downloadable game I own is Splatoon 2 which sits at 15GBs. Some Third-party games like Wolfenstein 2 do clock in at roughly 22GBs but that still isn't much especially considering that's a triple A game. With that in mind you can expect most big budget games to be in the 20GB range. The 200GB card is the sweet spot in my opinion where you will probably never have to buy another memory card for your switch again unless you really love those digital downloadable huge games, but even then it should still take you a few years to fill up.

  Buy the HP F510. I have used it in my work vehicle for 8+ hours a day with no problems. This one, the F330, died after only three months in my personal car with light use. Customer service is crap.  They don't listen to the fact that the camera will not power up at all. The original complaint was that the camera powered up one morning with a ""card reader error"" on the screen and then shut down.  No swapping of cards or power cords would remedy the problem. I told them this and they responded with questioning weather the card was formatted and told me that the card needed to be formatted regularly, or that maybe the card was the wrong card. I told them the card was the recommended card and the I had swapped out the card with a known good card but the problem was that the camera would not power up at all. This garnered another round of ""it might be the card. It needs to be a class 10 32g card"" along with ""it might be the power switch, can you send a detailed video of the power switch?"" Really? We need a detailed video of the power switch because I'm too much of a moron to tell if it's broken or not? I sent the effing video and a photo of the class 10 23g SD card and then got no response. I'm understandably pissed. A lifestraw bottle of almost the same value was replaced without question as soon as I asked about a problem. This is what I would have expected from HP and why I chose to purchase an HP product rather than one of the many choices from companies I have never heard of.  Guess I would have been better off rolling the dice on FuYoungSunnyLuck Enterprises, because right now that sounds like a more reliable option.

  Review is for SanDisk Ultra 400GB MicroSDXC UHS-I Card with Adapter - SDSQUAR-400G-GN6MA.  Bought it 12/2019 as a stocking stuffer to be used in Surface Pro.  By around March files started to go corrupt.  Ultimately formatted it (non-quick) and reused, but three months later corrupt files are happening again.  Can't trust this card anymore so it's headed to the shredder or, maybe, sister-in-law's mobile device.  Either way I'm done with it and do not recommend this product.

  Died after only 6 months use!! Over 100GB of music, documents, videos and images in limbo . . . Oh so very freaking nice . . . One day all my phone's apps stopped recognizing it. It just quit functioning. My PC didn't see it when I hooked it up my phone via USB. It was invisible! Fortunately I was able to retrieve files from it after actually pulling the dead card out and plugging it into a device to read microsd cards directly via USB and I tediously backed up everything to my computer.I have contacted SanDisk directly for them to honor the 10-year warranty. Their return policy is extremely time consuming requiring images of both sides of card and proof of purchase. I have wiped data and reformatted it before sending it back for a new card. We'll see how their replacement process goes...I will update this review on SanDisk's behavior for replacement of their faulty products later on. Buyer beware and do backup your data stored on their memory cards frequently. Thankfully, I did so, which made data recovery a quicker process.Update 9/24/20:  I updated my review to 3 stars as SanDisk finally delivered a new 200GB card yesterday. The entire laborious process took from September 2nd 2020 to September 23rd 2020 to get another card. 21 days . . . well this new card is working for now. Time will tell . . .

  I purchased this camera as an addition to my existing monitoring system...which consisted of a single Nest cam in my kitchen. The Nest cam had been used to monitor my senior dog, who died two months ago. But after bringing home a new puppy almost three weeks ago, I found that there was a blind spot in the system, and my puppy seems to have gravitated to it. (He's a genius.)First, the setup: it was frustrating as all hell. After eight attempts at connecting through WiFi, I had to do a wired setup. My modem is in a closet as part of a U-verse system, and accessing it is awkward, so that inconvenience was strike one. When the camera finally connected, the app wouldn't find the correct WiFi connection. So there's strike two.Strike three is easily seen in the screen capture from the cam: the cloud. Despite using the 1080mp setting, there is a fog, or a mist, or a cloud...whatever you want to call it...in the middle of the image. It's the same when lights are on. I've wiped down the lens with a dust-free cloth (used to clean my camera lenses), but it didn't resolve the issue. Also, despite having EXTREMELY high speed internet, panning the camera using the swipe on my iPad isn't very responsive.We'll see what happens over the next few days, but, at this point, I'm not certain I'll be keeping this camera.

  I needed to expand the memory space in my Nintendo Switch because I ran out of the 32 GB that came installed in it. Breath of the Wild alone took up about 16 GB! It was pretty difficult finding a micro SD card in my area within my budget, until I finally decided to go to the internet and found the SanDisk 256 GB card on Amazon for $49.99 (I'm not sure if that price is temporary since I bought it during the holidays). Once I ordered and received it, formatting the card to work in my Switch is a cinch, only takes a minute or so, and I have plenty of memory spaces for years to come (about 185 GB free after transferring/installing 10 games, mainly Mario, and some media apps). The write speed is about average, but the read speed is fantastic, which is a huge plus for playing games! I highly recommend getting this SanDisk card for your Switch and, if you're an avid gamer like me, get at least 256 GB.

  Better than I expected.  Supports very clear video at 1080p and 1296p (I didn't try 720p).  My wife and I were both impressed.  I haven't taken it for a ride in the car yet but am happy with what I see setting it up to look out a window at the street - daytime, night time, the WDR adjusts to the bright or limited light fine.  I was able to get it to take a 128 GB microSD and ran it through a full day plus without quite filling up (@1296p).  I'm happy with that. I had a problem getting wifi to work initially but maybe it was cause the battery wasn't fully charged.  Read the instructions to make sure you are connecting the correct SSID.  Anyway after several attempts I was able to access the wifi and it has good range.  I plugged it into the usb charger (mine) using the provided cable.  I was able to connect with my phone using the Akaso app and walk around the house (at least 20 ft) without any break in wifi.  Even stepped into another room and it was fine.  So since primary use would be in the car I think its great.  I downloaded several 3 minute videos and its fast enough for one or two clips.  If you want all of the clips, take it to a computer and download direct from the microSD.By putting it in the window I was able to get GPS lock, proving that it did sync with GPS.  I played it back later on the COBY player and it pulled up the location on Google maps fine for both locations I tested the GPS - again, I did not use it moving in the car yet.  The COBY player is not the most stable, seemed to hang after a couple of video clips.  If you just want to see the video (not the GPS) use VLC.  Much better image.Time synced perfectly when I made the phone wifi connection.To repeat - great video clarity.  Wish I had purchased a second one at that price.

  I bought this less than 2 years ago and used it very little. It stopped working suddenly during a transfer, was no longer recognized by PC or laptop. I tried a couple of different adapters, nothing. Couldn't even see the drive to reformat, just dead.. Luckily I didn't have any important data on there. The drive has a 10 year warranty, which sounds great if Sandisk cared to make the process streamlined, but they do not. There is no readily available information on what to do when this happens. I wasted my time troubleshooting with the tech support chat person only to be told to open an RMA ticket. Apparently he couldn't open one for me, I had to type in all the information I already provided in a form. Fine. I did that and was supposed to receive an email and a pre-paid label to send back the faulty card. That was a month ago and I haven't heard from SanDisk...

  So far very pleased. I have a Samsung ( galaxy) S7 phone and I was able to move/  transfer photos, videos, and documents to  this new SanDisk 200GB Ultra MicroSDXC UHS-I Memory Card with Adapter - 100MB/s, C10, U1, Full HD, A1, Micro S..... memory card.i inserted my new 200GB Sandisk micro sdxc memory card into the proper slot in the Vanja gadget  ( Vanja Micro USB OTG Adapter and USB 2.0 Portable Memory Card Reader for SDXC, SDHC, SD, MMC, RS-M.....) and inserted the Vanja  into the charging port of my Samsung S7 phone.  As hoped , the external device shows up in the phone's menu and you can then choose types of files you would like to ( copy or ) move- such as  photos, Video, Documents and non copy protected Audio.  It is my understanding that the phone may have trouble accessing information if you move apps?)You can see the ammount of memory allocated/ used  between your internal memory, the old ( existing in the phone) card, and the external card. When I was done, I disconnected the Vanja and replaced my existing memory card in the phone with the new one,  and  my phone seems to be working fine. As I am quite cautious, I copied the data I wanted to save ( rather than move) so the old data should still be available on the old card.  Even though  my old 32 GB card has been removed from the phone it is not erased.As I remember the AVAILABLE memory of the 200 gb card was approx 183GB ( plenty for me) and I did not attempt to ""format"" the new memory card at all, nor need a ""driver"" so apparently it is not necessary in this instance.AND the transfer was quite fast. Took a few minutes in each category,  but showing the number of photos  transfered / copied at a pace of about 10 per second, which is so much quicker than what I often encounter trying to move photos to my laptop.

  My first SanDisk 200GB I bought, sold by Amazon.com, was a fraudulent 32GB card, flashed to appear as a 200GB card.  This would be devastating if accidentally used, resulting in huge data corruption once you hit 32GB of writing.  You can download and use h2testw for free to test any SD card you purchase, and this is highly recommended.  If your card is legit, the program will say it is okay.  Otherwise, it will say something like 30.8GB OK, and the rest will be ""LOST"" or ""CORRUPTED""I purchased this VERY recently, so these fake cards are still in circulation, and are unavoidable.  Amazon WILL replace for free, and give you a free return shipping label.  As for the LEGIT card I got from Amazon as a replacement, it is FAST, and works perfectly.  It tested perfectly in the software.  The font for the fake card was SLIGHTLY off, most notably for the number ""200""  I attached the two pictures I took of the fake and real cards, and labeled them.

  I ordered the SanDisk ultra 400GB micro SDXC UHS- 1 CARD with Adapter.Why did I order this?I simply ordered out of necessity. My cell phone was freezing up due to lack of space I'm not functioning properly. I needed to take all of my pictures videos screenshots off of my current SD card freeing up some space.  I didn't want to be forced by my telephone provider into purchasing a new phone. (That's a different story).  Delivery; delivery was reasonably quick. However one thing I do notice, whenever I choose one option free delivery if I'm not paying attention it randomly changes. I do understand the need to limit the number of trips the delivery Amazon people need to make for my deliveries so I frequently or always choose to bundle the packages for the least number of trips.  So I ordered the card and I also ordered a USB 3.0 multi card reader.  Of course I needed the multi card reader along with the SD card which never came together. Never read the last I received an SD card. The product survives me putting it together I'm into my phone as needed and transferring all of my pictures etc on it.  as far as longevity, if I'm going to lose my pictures or any of my documents I hope not.

  After reading some of the reviews on this product, I decided to give the 64 gig card a chance.  The product does work and has 59.4 gig actual space (this is because of the math they use to fool you on how much space is on the card).  So far so good, right?  I ran a full test using H2testw v1.4 on the card after reading some of these cards may be fake.  Well, this card is NOT FAKE, but I discovered it is also NOT THE CARD THEY PROMISED.  They promised a card that has up too 100mb read speed. My test, which I ran multiple times, showed : Writing speed: 29.9 MByte/s & Reading speed: 40.4 MByte/s (nowhere close to what they advertise).  I then did some reading to find out the last generation of this card offered a 40mb read speed (the same speed as this card is reading).  So they are actually trying to fool us by sending out a last generation card and claiming it is the newer and faster version.  Most people may never noticed the difference, but when your device lags or crashes because of the slower speed, you will notice.  I am very dissapointed with this news as I had high hopes for this order.  Until they correct this issue, I would not recommend purchasing this card.

  Don't recommend. Based on other reviews, it is not worth risking loosing your pictures or videos. Purchase from a more reliable place for SD cards. I wouldn't trust this company for SD cards. The card also felt different than ones I have used for years from stores. Never had one from this company and this one is different so I decided its more important to be careful with pictures you can not get back if this card decides to give out. Purchase from somewhere you know is reliable. Also, it is cheaper than what this amount of gb usually is on an SD card so that is kind of a heads up.

  My dash cam originally included a 32GB Micro SD card for free. My dash cam has 2 cameras recording simultaneously and I realized that the capacity barely records 24 hours of footage. I came across this 64GB Mirco SD card which is the maximum capacity that my dash cam supports, but be careful when buying memory cards for dash cams. Most dash cams have specification on what memory cards are supported. The package for this memory card was very difficult to open, despite SanDisk giving guidance on where to cut to open. After cutting the perforations and failing to open, I ended up having to cut up the plastic package using a knife. Another problem is that the card heats up faster than other SD cards. Will update later, but I might need to upgrade to the SanDisk High Endurance version of the 64GB Mirco SD card if I encounter any issues in the future. Another problem is that the card does not actually have 64GB capacity, since about 2GB is not usable. Which is very misleading from the product description.

  Not much to say other than to remark on the validity of the SD card I received through Amazon actually being from SanDisk.SanDisk is one of, if not the biggest, SD card manufacturer and the quality of their products is the golden standard. So capacity, performance, and reliability goes without saying for these SD cards. However, I have read quite a lot of reviews claiming that the ones they received were imposters and, while I do not claim they are mistaken or not, I can say that my 400GB one I received from Amazon seems to check out through every test I've run it through.Amazon has quality customer care and product replacement/return policies for the ginormous corporation they are, so if you have any issues with your product I'm sure you can get it worked out within reason. There are a lot of different resources for checking the validity of SD cards online and you can find them all with a simple search on a quality search engine website. If you are concerned, I suggest going that route or contacting local IT support to see what they can do for you.PROS:SanDisk. Enough said. Quality and performance.CONS:Obviously, verrry slim chance of the SD card being a fake. Technology is amazing these days and there are people out there driven to make a quick buck if they've got the materials and the know-how. Even giants like Amazon can fall victim to these numerous and unethical kinds of practices.Happy with my purchase. 100% 400GB SanDisk SD card at a reasonable price.

  I priced around and researched many hours for the outside video's and micro chips to use with them. This chip is high quality and large volume and priced economically.  I access the micro chip quite a bit to monitor our little RV park and the quality of video's are excellent.  The app I use has the ability to snap shot during viewing so when I open the snapshot and enlarge it the quality from this cop is excellent and that is using high def, not the super high ded. I can see faces and license plates clear as a bell.I will add an addendum later for how long these chips hold up.

  I bought this to go in a DROGRACE Kids Camera for my 6 yr old's bday gift.  He tried to pull the memory card out and it broke in half.  You are supposed to push the card in and it pops out a little which allows you to take it all the way out.  I know he should not have pulled to get it out, but I also don't think this should have broken just from his tiny fingers pulling on the card.

  One question I had about this SD card is how fast I would be able to write to it.  A UHS-1 card is spec'ed to do a minimum of 10 MBps.  Since that's a minimum, I wondered what the card would actually do so I put it in my computer and copied a large folder to it.Turns out, the card I got wrote about 37 MBps, or maybe a bit more.  See the picture of the speed of the system copying the files to the card.  A UHS-3 card will operate at a minimum of 30 MBps so the card I received is working at UHS-3The only other question is how long it will last but that can't be answered yet.

  To be honest, I really didn't need one of these cards, but a decent brand name 200GB micro SD card for the price of a nice dinner, I couldn't resist.  I had to stretch to find a use for it, and I ended up using it to store and play my Wii ROMs and plugged it into the back of my Wii with a USB adapter.  I copied over 150GB of Wii ROMs onto it and the average write speed (NTFS file system by the way) was around 15MB/s, not too bad IMO.  The load times of the ROMs on the Wii are now noticeably faster than the magnetic USB hard drive they used to be stored on.  I'm sure there are faster flash cards out there, but as of now, I doubt they'll be $0.125/GB.

How did these things slipping through Amazon?Another Updates:I did use multiple files to copy over to the sd card. I even use Windows.iso which is less than 4GB and other linux iso. None of them able to copy over to the sd card. You can also use FakeFlashTest to test if your SD card is logically resize to make it looks big.Right now I am testing the new replacement SD cards which I just received today.

  UHS-1 is a little slow by today’s standards. Fine for recording HD video, but will slow down phone performance if you install apps on it. So just consider what you’re using it for.Also be aware that counterfeit cards do turn up from time to time (in general—I’m not talking specifically about this listing or Sandisk or even Amazon). There are free programs you can use to verify that the capacity really is as advertised. (Fake ones will seem to work at first but will lose your data once you exceed their actual, lower-than-labeled capacity.)

For reference, I bought a 200 GB or so for the drive itself, and was moving about 44 GB of music onto there.Eventually I believed it was a scam, and so tested it using H2W. H2W managed to write the appropriate amount of GB fake files down, but over half of the data was unusable, either being lost or corrupted. I have put the results in my review as evidence. The usable data space is so unpredictable, and not capable of keeping the 44 GB of music, that it is utterly useless to me as storage of any kind. Thank goodness I didn't use it for precious photos or something irreplaceable, and just wanted my media collection on the go.I am unsure whether it was a bootleg or not, but I suspect it might've been one. The packaging, which would be the most tell-tale sign, was alas burned by my husband. Upon checking the SD adapter and the card itself, the sd adapter did not have a serial while the SD card itself did.It has failed to do as it promised, and I will think twice about buying another electronic device off of Amazon, as this is the second time that this website has left me with complete garbage when it comes to technology. 0/10, do not buy.

I pulled the thing out of my Box O' SD Cards and plopped an image on it. After hours of tinkering to figure out why I couldn't get the thing to boot, I ran some tests. The speed is abysmal (~80 Mbps) and the capacity isn't being reported correctly by any OS I plug the thing in to. It's definitely counterfeit.

  Works perfectly!  Everything saves quickly.  This came with an adapter, so it can be used either in a micro- slot or a regular SD slot.  The most important issue to watch is that different devices can handle different sized cards.  Your user manuals will let you know if your device can handle 16 gb, 32, 64, or...?  Stay within the given limits, and you'll be all right.  The second consideration is whether you want your data on a few larger cards or more smaller ones.  I do prefer smaller ones for long term storage.  That is because if a card is eventually lost or damaged, I prefer to lose less of what I have archived.  That's it!  I hope that this is helpful to you. If so, please hit the ""helpful"" button.  Many thanks, and happy shopping!

  My pc is telling me this is an invalid device. So I put it into the sd card adapter and tried again and again it tells me there is no device. It sees the adapter and the usb reader and assigns a drive letter but says there is not a valid device. so i figure maybe I need to format it. It says there is no device to format.I did order a new micro SD card reader just to verify its not my sd card reader. if it is my reader and it is able to read the micro sd card I will change my review to an appropriate review at that time. I am afraid its not going to be any better. I saw others leaving similar reviews but thought maybe they were somehow leaving it on the wrong item since this is supposed to be sandisk. Never had a problem with a sandisk item but maybe this is not a real sandisk.  What made me think this is when I tried to use the sd card adapter and saw it was a very low quality adapter and was very hard to insert the micro sd card into it.

I received a text message upon activation, and thought that this would successfully set up service.  When I landed at my destination and changed SIM cards, nothing worked.  No phone.  No internet.  No text messages.I attempted to use the help number that was provided with this kit, only to be informed that the phone number that I was assigned was not an Orange number, and refused to assist me further.  I did not have an opening during my trip to visit an outlet store during their limited opening hours, and so I went without a phone for the duration of my trip.I know that products like this may be hit-and-miss.  For me, this was a huge miss.  Do yourself a favor, and get your SIM card from a physical storefront or booth after you land.

  I just received this package today and as soon as I did, I inserted it into my laptop, formatted it for NTFS, and then ran a full test with h2testw.exe. The total time to run the test was between 2 and three hours. The SD card passed the test 100%. The program, h2testw, filled the SD card with blocks of data and then read them back verifying each one. In this way it both verified the total capacity of the card as well as its integrity. In light of the amount I paid for this card I can only say that it is a great value. I would certainly recommend it given my experience with it so far.Update: I will add that the measured speeds of the SD card were less than the posted speeds. They ranged from 45 MB/s to 65 MB/s. That is quite a lot less than the claimed speed. I still find the card acceptable though because a) the actual speeds are quite good as it is and b) to expect a card of this capacity and price to operate at those claimed speeds is unrealistic.

  We have tried many other discount microSD cards in the 1024GB and 1TB claimed - and those other cheap ones are scams. At least with SanDisk you get a name brand you can trust - and it's earned that trust.2 of our phones (Samsung s7 and LG g6) have the Sandisk 400GB (one with the a1 and another a2 type memory).The a2 is snappier / faster to load the data for apps.Do not buy the cheap 1024GB cards - while they may say they have that capacity and work for a while - they will all hit a limit (some as low as 32GB of actual storage capacity).We learned that you can actually tell the computer how much storage you want to display on any hard drive - and then it shows your used storage percentage of that number.With an actual 400GB sandisk - that's how much they have. It's real.Just be sure to buy it direct from Amazon or an official reseller or you may get a fake SanDisk - which is where most bad reviews come from - fake cards.

  Bought this for my Paralenz underwater camera that shoots up to 4K 30fps.My camera manufacturer says 128gb V30 is the required max but this card is rated for a min of 10mb/sec & and the write speed is undocumented publicly after contacting Sandisk, with transfer speeds to 100mb/sec.Maybe they won't release write speeds because it performs so well they don't want it competing with their faster rated cards?.... just speculation of course!But this card performs flawless... not only in my Galaxy Note 4 phone but also in my camera. Leave it formatted in the default exFat and your good!After much research it appears its only weakness may be in burst abilities for use as internal memory but sustained transfer rates are great!... so much so that 4k @ 30fps video was no problem in testing.I'm also astonished this card works so well in my Note 4, I had a 128gb Sandisk in before and this definitely feels faster.At this point I have the highest recommendations for this card.... you can now store mass amounts of 4K footage.... according to my tests so far, about 10+ Hrs of 4K @ 30 fps!I've found other brands often give similar speeds as compared to Sandisk but fail miserably long term in reliability.... Do you really want 400 GB worth of stuff lost because you wanted to save a few bucks with another brand?Sandisk is the most reliable IMO and it's amazing they remain at the front of the pack.It's not the fastest dog out of the gate that wins, but the one who can make it to the finish line first!I own 3 of these now.I can film 2.7k @ 60fps and put 17 one hour dives in a week long dive vacation and I only use about 180gig!Its great not having to tote a big laptop on my trips!I have one just for backup too on my trips ..

  I""m a huge music fan. I've been collecting music since 1996. I used to always carry a hard cover cd case which contained cds + cases. Once I got to 100, this became cumbersome. I reluctantly switched to CD books. Now I could carry a lot more music. However, once I got past 256 this also became cumbersome. Around this time mp3 players came out. Problem solved. Even with the advent of ""smartphones"" I still clung to my dedicated mp3 player. Once I caved and got a smartphone I STILL kept my dedicated MP3 players. Eventually I caved on that as well and began using WInAMP (switched to MediaMonkey a few yrs ago when WInAmp died. RIP!). Now i'm introduced to a new problem. Due to the size of the storage options available I couldn't bring all of my music with me (currently about 66GB/13K+ songs). Larger memory cards were pretty expensive so I limited myself to the 32GB cards and only synced playlists. TBH I've never been a huge fan of this playlist thing. I liked just having ALL of my music and randomly picking albums I felt like listening to. The playlist thing forced me to limit myself which was very annoying.Years later, the prices have dropped significantly. This is what I've been waiting for.Warning: be sure to FORMAT this card with the exFAT standard which supports large sizes. Regular exFAT will have you pissed off once you start going over a certain amount, haha. The files simply will fail to transfer.

It shipped sooner than promised, and though Amazon Logistics missed their promised delivery date, it still got here sooner than expected. I tested the card via windows free apps: FakeFlashTest and H2testw (under Parallels). The card checks out for the advertised capacity (~183GB formatted EX-FAT), and averaged 22 MB/s write and 25MB/s read. GREAT! It is fast enough to benefit from a USB3 SD adapter/reader.

  Mine appears to be genuine.  It factored out at about 60gb and comparing speeds with my other A1, class 10 card, the read/write was about 18mb.  Your mileage will vary depending on what the hardware you're using and various other factors but guaranteed, it won't come close to 100mb.  If you want a faster card, buy the 'u3' for twice as much.  I can't say if the card is that great but I've been using the same type card in a dashcam for over a year now and no issues so far even though temps in the truck probably average 130F most of the summer.  Can't say that about other versions of the card from sandisk.  BTW, personally I've never had any luck using these cards for sandisk with 4k action cams.  Lots of streaking, pixalation and skips.  Cam vs card, I can't tell because I won't spend twice as much for a faster card.

  The card would not work in any device (phone, tablet, PC) unless I put it into the adapter and used the SD slot on my desktop. It actually tested out to be a 64GB card (using H2testw) but ran VERY slowly. At first I thought it might be counterfeit but after some detective work I think it was just defective.

  400 GB is really 367 GB. While, technically, the card does contain 400 gigabytes of storage (as in 400 billion bytes), this is misleading since operating systems have never reported the actual number of bytes this way. Rather, they use the binary system where one GB is 1024 to the third power or 1,073,741,824 bytes. Mount this card on any operating system and the amount of storage is shown as 367 MB. This is what we are all used to since computing devices were invented and these cards are used in these computing devices that report their capacity in the binary form. So why continue the deception? More sales equals more money. Or, put another way, one company started doing it and now they all do it and no one company will do it correctly for fear that they will lose their competitiveness.When I read the manual for my device and it says ""Maximum capacity allowed on the SD card is x GB."" then I trust that I need to get an SD card that is X GB if I want to fully utilize that feature. I don't want have to try to figure out that, to get X GB, I have to look for a card that has X * 1.??? GB. In fact, you can't even get a card that has X * 1.??? GB because the manufacturers make cards with capacities like 64, 128, 200, 256, 400, etc. So, essentially, we're getting screwed out of some percentage of storage because the card manufacturers want to play a different game than the entire rest of the industry.

  Update: August 13, 2019, TuesdayAfter a purchasing this same memory card from another buyer, it's been shown that some of those Micro SD cards have to be compatible on both the device being used to record, and the one used to replay/playback the recordings. To access the full span of the 128gb, some devices (like the security camera I purchased the Micro SD card for) can only read up to 32gigs of memory no matter how much memory is on the card. SO it is possible that I was using a device that can only read up to 32gigs at a time. I haven't repurchased this item from this supplier so as not to leave it up to chance, although I will update them from 1 stars to 3 stars simply due to my own lack of knowledge at the time. Perhaps their product did work as expected...Possibly.....Original Post:I purchased what I thought was this item on Friday November 2, 2018 and thought it was a great deal because it was cheap. I read other reviews about even cheaper ones selling for $7-$12 that said those were a scam and not the actual product. So I thought that since this one was priced at $22.25 at the time, that this one was legit. THIS MEMORY CARD IS NOT THE 128GB MICRO SD CARD as advertised. To make sure I was not falling victim to the scams the other reviews talked about, I tried to transfer something well over 32gigs (40+ GIGS) just to be sure. It told me I needed 14.4 more gigs to copy it. That's strange......seeing as how this is advertised as a 128gb Micro Sd Memory Card. AGAIN, THIS IS NOT THE 128GB MICRO SD MEMORY CARD AS ADVERTISED!!!

  Not all SD cards are created equal. There are cheaper cards, but if you need a high speed card for video as required by many phones and tablets, this is the one to get. Slower cards may be fine for mp3 audio and low resolution video, but if you want to be able to read the text in a video or see the details of a subtle change of expression, then you're going to need a card capable of transferring all that data to the screen without stuttering. SanDisk is a leader in memory production at a reasonable price. I've purchased 3 of these cards for my devices and none have ever so much as hiccupped once.

  , I don't think I'll ever run out of space on my phone. I love this: I never really have to download pictures or video from my phone, and I can permanently store whatever movies, documents, or other files I wish.  Even after shooting thousands of photos and hours of video, I have hundreds of gigabytes of free space left.On the Samsung Note 9, the 400GB card reports 366.8 GB of free space after formatting. Using a speed testing application, my card reports write speeds of 48 MB/s and read speeds of 86 MB/s.Suggestions:* After purchase, get an SD card speed testing application to verify that your card isn't fake, and that its performance approaches SanDisk's hyped theoretical maximum. Don't be put off if you don't reach 100 MB/s or whatever the advertised maximum speed might be; you just want to be somewhere in the ballpark.  If you are using Android, you can download an excellent SD cart-testing application from the Play store called ""SD Card Test.""* On some Android devices you can further verify that you have a legitimate (not fake) card by downloading an application called SD Insight (note this app is not compatible with the Galaxy Note 9 and some other late-model Android devices.)note: I was *not* solicited to write this review, and I bought this product with my own money. I received no compensation for this review and indeed I have no idea who the seller might be. I pride myself on writing unbiased reviews.

    High quality microSD card
  
",5.0 ,,"Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2019","









  
  
    
  Bought this for my Samsung phone so that I could get apps, photos, and music off the phone itself.  Formatted capacity is 119GB (that whole base10 vs. base2 thing), but works as would be expected.One note.  I have noticed that my phone is sometimes laggy when pulling up apps that have been moved to the card.  It's not all the time, but it does occur.  A lag of sometimes 2 seconds doesn't seem like a whole lot, but you do notice it.  Not saying it isn't my phone, but there was a 64GB microSD in there before (also SanDisk), and I didn't notice the lag that I see now.  If this was being used in a still or video camera it might be a bigger issue, but for this it's just a sometimes-annoyance.Still, for the price and reliability of SanDisk, pleased with this card.  Could be more pleased, but I'll take the reliability over speed.

  Be careful when Amazon recommends this with a dashcam, it will fail. It worked for a couple of days then started to fail.I contacted SanDisk about it and they indicated it is not recommended for this use, extra small print on the back of the packaging. Amazon refunded, thank you, and I purchased a Lexar at a lower price and higher write speed.

  I bought a package of 3 of the 128gb to go in some trail cameras I bought.  After formatting as directed I used the cameras at a storage facility because of some theft problems.  After some thefts occurred I really needed to see the info on the disks.  2 out of the 3 did not record ANYTHING.....as it said card error.  I will not ever buy again.  The one disk that worked only got the area where the thefts did not occur.  Had these disks worked as they should have I would have caught the thief on it.

  I received this today for my wifes surface pro 3. I inserted it in the micro SD slot behind the back stand. (The reason my wifes had this for over 2 years and i never knew it had a micro SD slot) i showly pushed the sd card into the slot. Til it clicked. I had a 32gb in it prior. Make sure you unmount it first. I didnt and it still showed the 32gb card. I unmounted the new 400gb drive. Then removed it for the surface pro. And reinstalled it. It read 360gb, which i guess is the norm.I would recommend this card.I found out that you can move apps, told the sd card google how to move apps to a a usb drive, or the Micro SD slot.Both do good job of making more sysytem storage. My experience was the micro SD slot was slightly faster.

  I have no idea how to buy an SD card. This is advertised as being fast enough to save pictures and music on. Yet my hard drive has to be my storage by default because this speed is not high enough to store directly to the card. Very disappointed. I guess I have to buy a $40 card to get what I'm looking for which is a card that is able to store both my music and pictures on an SD card. San disk is GARBAGE!!!

  I was kicking myself for downloading Smash Bros instead of buying the physical copy.  It quickly ate up all the space in my 16gb microSD card.  I literally could not play the game because it needed to update and didn't have the space to do it.  I knew it was time to upgrade my storage.I was only going to do like a 256, but then I realized that I hate buying games and keeping up with them and having to store all those bulky game cases.  I so splurged and went for the big boy 400gb card.  So glad I did.  Realistically, I won't have to worry about storage space ever again.Yes, this product does work with the switch.  You'll need to format it which you can do just by doing an internet search for nintendo switch sd card formatting.  You'll get a hit for a nintendo site where they tell you how to do this.  Format, plug in, go.Also, if you are upgrading your current storage for the switch, you absolutely can transfer everything over from your old sd card to your new one.  Literally just format the new one, and copy and paste all the files over.  Super simple.  Next to no effort. You are good to go no glitches or hang ups.Finally I must say that I bought my 400gb microSD card from an Amazon Warehouse deal.  Absolutely fantastic.  So glad they do this.  It's always great to get discounts on returned/damaged/opened items.  Worth it every time.

  This micro SD card arrived quickly.  I loaded it on my Surface Pro 7, Windows 10.  No problem recognizing the card.  The file information showed that there was a total of 476GB on the card, with 2MB being used by the card.  So that is about 36GB short of what it advertises.  I find that most drives, cards, etc. are usually somewhat under what they advertise.  Using my USB C port I copied about 65GB of data over to the new card.  Write speed averaged around 35MB/s with highs around 38MB/s.  Not bad but not 100MB/s.  Not sure what the speeds will be once I install it in the Surface.  Can't speak to durability as I only received it today.  Overall seems to be good.  Will revisit the review if any problems arise, or if it performs better once it is installed in the Surface.

  This is the second 400GB Micro SDXC card I bought.  The first one was for my phone, because I take so many videos.  That was months ago, when I first got my Samsung S8, and it's still a very reliable storage device.This second one is for my new Surface Pro 4, because I wanted to pay for a better processor while sacrificing on internal storage.  Adding this Micro SDXC to the Surface Pro turned out to be an excellent decision.  I saved a lot of money overall, and I have a storage device that I can pop out to any device I choose.  On the Surface Pro, the Micro SD card slot is tucked in under the stand, so you never have to worry about accidental ejection when you're on the go.Delivery was fast, too.  I recommend the seller and the product, especially for business use and for Surface Pro users.

  I'm honestly too pissed to write much of a detailed review. Card comes write protected and it cannot be removed. The write protection prevents the card from storing information so it could not be used to upgrade the memory card in my Galaxy S9. Absolute bs and is of course beyond the return date because switching the memory card in my phone was not urgent and I'd assumed it would be fine. In order to return to the company you have to fill out a detailed form and wait for who knows how long. Don't waste your money on a possibly bunk disk. Now I have to put my old memory card back(thankfully I didn't delete everything) and order a new memory card from a different maker and seller. Would give negative stars if I could!

  Fast shipping, no damage, worry free.Got the 256GB microSD for my LG G7 Fit 32GB. System used 14GB & Other Apps used 7GB (Undeletable, Unmovable Apps)Packaging for microSD is very subtle but it is designed in a way to make your day easier. You can open everything with out scissors. Very thin plastic film is over the microSD so you just need to carve the outer edge with your finger or pen to get it out. And the microSD stays in place in the center so it doesn't just fall off or fly out while your opening package. Subtle but I noticed these features, my focus was to not to drop the small memory card the whole time but I didn't need to worry about that.Installation is easy. If you ever changed a Sim card you will know what to do. Newer models of phones will have a slot where the Sim slot and SD slot are either on top or on the sides. You will see a small tiny hole, penetrate the tiny hole with some force behind it once located with your industry standard pin. I took a picture for this for comparison, for people who might worry they won't be able to penetrate the tiny hole so those individuals don't panic. If you never received a pin, you can use regular paper clips to open the slot and McGyver your way forward. You can see they are both long enough & smooth to not cause damage to your smartphone upon entry and they both have similar girth in size which is always nice, also please do not use needle pins they are too pointy and uncomfortable for your slot.I bought 2 microSD cards, first one had no issues and was ready to go in a second. Second card however ran into a hiccup, don't wanna use the word issue because the screen was giving me ""Corrupt Memory Card"" warnings and in the notification bars but after opening the SD file application all from the drop down notification bar the memory card scanned itself and optimized according to the phone! This process took 7 seconds.Very happy with this purchase, will buy again. Have a great day!

  - I have tried so many different SD cards from various manufacturers, at various price points, in the name of trying to save a few bucks. It was really important to me back when a 128GB card cost $50 or more. They all do the same thing, so what’s the difference, really?What I've found is that it can be extremely aggravating to put up with when the card does not perform well or does not perform at all. I have heard warning stories about cards that are advertised as one size and actually are another size, causing data loss. With that in mind, I have never tried using the very cheapest card or too-goo-to-be-true card deals. But I have purchased cards on sale at the drugstore or even tried some strange brands. What I have come back to is that it’s just not worth the trouble now that prices have dropped so low. When I am trusting 128 GB of data to a single card, it’s just not worth my time and aggravation to have a card that won’t perform. Furthermore, SanDisk cards like this one are all FAST ENOUGH. I’m not a pro photographer, and I don’t have time to figure out whether a card is Class 1 or Class 3 or whatever. I just want it to be good enough that it can keep up with my devices.I have now purchased several SanDisk cards, and each and everyone of them has arrived in perfect condition and works perfectly every time. They are faster than any other card that I use and I've never suffered data loss. I am putting this card into my Fiio X5ii Digital Audio Player, and it works just fine. During the initial data transfer I have already noticed that the speed is adequate, and I never experience skipping when playing uncompressed high-resolution audio files. I have the same card for my Nintendo Switch, and it works perfectly.The prices on these are so good now you have no excuse but to buy good name brand like SanDisk. Just buy it and don't worry about it.

  This m 400gb card meets My expectations.If you expect for the card to meet the representations on the box. Dream on as  none do.But if you are looking for a fast card adequate for Go Pro Camera or basic 1080P Digital Photography this card will serve.Let me begin by saying that this card was bought Used directly from Amazon. I always have success buying items subject to Counterfeiting directly from Amazon.Because it was used I decided to put,it through the paces. After all it wouldn't be the first time a buyer does a switcherooee.I used a program called H2Testw and used it on the SD Card Slot on my Computer.H2TestW filled the whole Card up with Files and then verified it so I confirmed that I got the whole I think it was 375gb  but SDMaid on my Phone says 394gb formatted. And its result was 45gbs write and 75gbs Read.It took more than 2 hours to fill the card with files than verify the info but the result is that I'm positive the storage is actual storage and not software tricks.I tried some other programs to benchmark the card and had good results.Finally after confirming the card is the advertised Capacity and not fake Storage, I put in my Phone and used a program called CPTD or Cross Platform Disk Test and got a Sequential Write of 37.29MB/s Write and 85.7MB Read.I think that the limiting factor is the speed of your phone and controller not the card.Anyway I'm satisfied with the Speed. Real life results  of 37 -45MBs Write and 75-85MBs read is very respectable. Plenty fast for 1080p recording and Video which I use.I am very happy with my purchase made directly  from Amazon.

Quit archiving your games off of your Switch when running out of storage, this will hold your whole library with lots of room to spare.

  Incredible performance in my LG Aristo 2. the specifications for my phone say that the maximum supported SD card is 32GB but it magically works just fine. It really does increase the performance of apps even though Android 7.1 does not support moving apps to the SD card. For example using ES file manager to browse video files, the video files thumbnails load very quickly. Another example would be using Minecraft with external storage, saving and loading is at least twice as fast compared to the 32GB high-performance card I had before and saving pictures and videos to the external storage is much snappier when using the photo gallery and swiping through recent pictures. It also was ten dollars cheaper than buying an equivocal card at Target or Walmart. The funny thing is they provide equal capacity cards for higher prices that are normally not SanDisk, for example Polaroid cards are more common at Target. I love SanDisk cards, I've never had one fail just like I've never had a Western Digital hard drive fail for no reason. Only buy SanDisk if you value quality long term and never want to second guess your cards.

  I've heard horror stories of faulty/fake/wrong SD's being delivered instead of the real deal, and I'm pleased to say I had no such issues. It's a SanDisk SD, and for the most part it's everything I expect. However, unfortunately, it's packing only ~366 GB of space, which is, IMO, lower than it should be considering it's a 400 GB card. I know it's almost always a tad bit lower than advertised, but 34 GB seems like a lot of lost space. As such, I'm shaving off a couple stars.I purchased the SD card for my Nintendo Switch, which of course was an insanely easy installation process (I had no photos or videos to transfer over so it made things even simpler). Better yet, I got this during a holiday deal for like ~$150 off, so all in all it's not like I lost much from the missing 34GB. That being said, there's no way I'd buy this full price moving forward and I'll continue to wait for sales on items like these to compensate for the lost space.

  SanDisk is a reliable brand, and this product is no exception. I bought this for my kindle fire because there is an upper limit to the size of microSD card it could accept. Been using it for a while now and transfer speeds are good, capacity is as-listed, and it's been pretty stable other than one trip through the airport where I lost some data. Easy enough to replenish from backup, but still a curious event - that hadn't happened to me before and all the factory built-in storage was fine. But this is a good buy - go ahead and make the purchase.

  So far it's nothing to write home about. This Sandisk 400 Ultra sd card is advertised at 100 mb/s. When my PC is only getting a top max speed of 32.5 mb/s. When I have one of the latest HP Ryzen 5  AMD processor 16 gig ram. When this model was released this year. This really makes me wonder how Sandisk is measuring their processing speeds? I'm nearly done transferring some music and it never got close to their advertised speed of 100 mb/s?? Hmm Very disappointing

    Big gains for older Phone
  
",5.0 ,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this to upgrade an older Galaxy Note 3 smart phone because I tend to hold onto things that work and work well, which this phone has. A quick bit of research showed that as a 64GB supporting SDXC-compliant phone, the Note 3 should support any SDXC card up to and even surpassing 256GB. Happy to report, it does indeed.I'm getting the full available volume of space on the card which means I've increased the originally rated ""maximum supported"" space of the device four-fold, and with no odd problems showing up.The card is much faster with read/write speeds as well. I can load up a 2GB file in under a minute, whereas the older 64GB card I bought around 4 years ago took about 4-5 minutes to do the same.As a performance booster, this card has been a good purchase.I've used SanDisk cards for digital photography and they've always performed exceptionally well. I see no reason to believe that this card won't perform just the same.If you have an older phone or other device that supports 64GB / SDXC cards (MicroSD or other form factor) in exFAT format, then you should quite likely be able to use an SDXC 128GB, 256GB or even 512GB card in it without issue... SDXC being able to in theory support up to 2TB in size. Not that we may ever SEE a 2TB MicroSD card, but one can dream.

  Unlike larger cards you do not want to insert and remove this thing to download pictures.  I noticed that in my camera it normally takes several tries to get it to click and stay in the camera.  The larger cards are my favorite because I can pop the card out in the field, insert another blank one, and download the photos from the one in use. So, I suggest you put this card in once and leave it there.  And only load this card at home on a table with a cloth underneath.  If you drop this tiny card on the floor you won't enjoy trying to find it. Fortunately, I had that experience with a Garmin once... never again.

  So I just got the 200GB version in the mail. Due to negative reviews I was very worried about how my mSDcad would turn out. So lets get to the point: It is easy for scammers mess with the cards to make them appear bigger than they actually are. So it is IMPORTANT that once you get your card that you download a software called h2testw. I used it and after about an hour or 2 it reported no errors. Everything checks out for mine regarding that concern.  I got this card for my switch that I, at the time of writing this, am still waiting to receive. I may update as time goes on, but so far so good.UPDATE: 1Got my switch, set it up and began downloading the following games : Zelda - Breath of the wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, and Fortnite.  So far the games are downloading without issue, 2 which have completed. The microSD is working as expected. The write speeds could be faster however, but for the price I paid and size it is not so bad for an SD card.  I reccommend this over ANY nintendo branded m-SDcards

  Man, what an amazing piece of technology.  To be able to fit 400gb of data on something so tiny.  I was really surprised it worked on my Galaxy Tab 4 (7"" model).  It is only supposed to support up to a 64GB micro SD card.  Bottom line- it lets you add a huge amount of storage space to portable devices which are capable of using them.

  There is not such thing as writing speed mixed up with transfer rates. The description says: ""Transfer speeds of up to 98MB/s**"" and later on, it says : Read Speed: up to 80MB/s.NO, this micro SD is not capable of writing at 98MB/s. It is capable of writing up to about 20 MB/s maximum and reading is around 90 MB/s. I used it in action cams and even though it is capable of recording 4K 60fps, the quality is not even, due most probably to the limitations of this SD card.

  Read and write speeds are pretty good (when your SD card reader/slot can fully utilize those speeds), storage comes out to 366GB after formatting. Honestly, I'm probably going to run out of storage after an extra 3-7 Switch games (currently have 27 full titles with NES online, 3 demos, and YouTube) but it's definitely an excellent option for an expanding library. Haven't used this for a smartphone, but for those with expandable storage Smartphones I highly recommend this card as it's a great way to store plenty of HD and UHD videos, quality photos, and music.

  Hard to think that there’s 400 GB in a tiny microSDXC card that’s the size of your pinky nail. I’m using my SD card on my Nintendo Switch. I mainly buy physical games, but now a days they’re putting half of the game on the game cartridge and the rest has to be downloaded to the system. Well, I was running low on space. I deleted all my games from the system memory so everything will only be on the SD card. But I haven’t noticed any slowdowns, and if anything I actually think that it runs faster from the SD card.

No sooner than he got out of the Amazon delivery van my (hardly speaking English) neighbors TWO German Shepherds were aggressively running at him and he was quick on his feet and avoided what could have been a vicious attack resulting in one of us have to take extreme measures to stop them. I've never seen someone get that close to getting attacked. Hats off to you buddy!!!As for my review, I reviewed this just to shine a light on how dangerous Amazon delivery crew can have it and if you have a big breed dog keep them in your control! As far as the SD card, with a baby you're constantly taking videos and photos and I have cattle so I'm constantly taking pictures and photos of them as well. My phone fills up quickly! The SD card provides me with the ability to take them store for later dates and revisit ones I have bought over the years via computer, phone, or any pharmacy with a photo center I can pop this bad boy in and print off what I need. I take a crazy amount of pics and videos, so it takes me about a year or so to fill up a 64GB, so I opted for the 200GB, I'm hoping this one lasts a little longer. A good tip is to write the year with a fine point sharpie marker on the SD Card its self (I never keep the plastic piece that it goes in. I was thinking this year I may go with letters and write in a journal the corresponding letter (tape the SD Card beside it) and what all is on that particular SD Card. Like Baby's 1st bday, father in law's bday, Christmas 2020, Thanksgiving 2020. It would be cool if they made a case for these that holds 100, with a place for descriptions.

  I got this 128 GIG card to use with my tablets.  So far it has worked perfectly in my testing. I always keep a couple of spares around for my future buys and I seem to give a lot of my SD cards away to family and friends. I picked up this 128 GIG at a great price and I just couldn’t pass it up.I own about 100 SD cards and I always do a speed test to verify the reading and writing speeds before I install the memory. This card checked out extremely well. The fastest write speed on this card was 73.143 MB/Sec and the fastest reading speed was 93.368 MB/Sec. I have attached the graphical test data for your information. I used a USB 3.0 port with a USB 3.0 card reader for the test.Overall, this card worked well and I rated it five stars. If I have any future issues I will update my review.I hope my review and photo of the test data helps you.Out of 100 plus SD cards I have purchased from Sandisk I have only had one fail.  With Sandisk’s 10 year warranty they replaced it and sent me a new one at no charge.  That is the advantage when you purchase high tech from a top company that stands behind their product.I simply called them and returned the old chip and they sent me a new one.I am amazed at how well these work and how low the price has gotten on a sale day.  Putting one of these into your phone or tablet is a wonderful upgrade to the device’s storage capability.Almost no one needs a 128 GIG chip but at sales prices you can’t pass up getting them.This is a great product and it makes your smart devices even more powerful.This is a simple and easy upgrade for your smart devices.

  I love it! Works great in my Galaxy Note 8! Fast enough that I can throw pretty much anything at it. If you're wondering, modern Android versions (starting with Lollipop, as I recall) have the ability to read up to 1 TB of external storage. While this 400GB card is the maximum capacity you can currently buy*, the leading manufacturers are feverishly working to make larger capacity cards. For now, though, I think 400GB is enough to handle all the 4K video I can shoot.*- Don't be fooled by unscrupulous sellers, particularly on auction sites ( I won't name it because there are a lot of fake cards here, too), who list ridiculously large capacity cards for astonishingly low prices... you don't get what you pay for! They take cheap, generic cards, usually no more than 4 or 8 GB, and rewrite the card's firmware & re-label it to make it act and appear like a larger card... 256GB, 500GB or higher! There are tons of listings out there for 1 TERABYTE microSD cards! Of course there's no such thing: and when the physical memory of the card is reached, your device will simply start overwriting data... and your precious photos, videos and other files will be gone forever. In fact, one third of all SanDisk cards on the market are counterfeit! You can avoid all this by installing and using a free app called SD Insight to determine if your card is legitimate.
