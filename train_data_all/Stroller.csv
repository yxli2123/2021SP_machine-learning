    Very nice stroller!
  
",5.0 ,Karla Shaw,"Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2019","









  
  
    
  My stroller just arrived yesterday. I haven’t had a chance to put it to practical use but so far I love it. It was easy to unfold, simple to put together. I have a small home and was able to maneuver it smoothly and easily.  I love the design. It looks very nice - black with gray accent trim The back of the seat that looks gray in the picture looks more like a very light blue and very pretty. I like that the cup trays are removable from both seats to allow for car seat placement. The front seat doesn’t recline all the way but I couldn’t find a double stroller in my price range that both seats did. It goes back far enough that I think it would still be comfy for sleeping. I love that the back seat reclines all the way. This way baby can be reclined/sleeping in his carrier in the front and my 2yo can still nap in the back seat if needed. One cool part about the back seat bassinet option is there is a flap that you can velcro up so that bottle/toys/blanket don’t fall out the front (would only go into basket below but still nice) It would be nice if the recline positions were adjustable as they each only have up or down but options seem comfy. With baby in front and toddler in the back they will be facing each other which could be good or bad. But there’s always the option to switch them too. The storage basket is a nice size and I like accessability from the back. Only problem is you can’t really access it when the back seat is reclined. My daughter tried to stand up in the basket underneath (not strapped in bc just trying it out) so we will have to see how the durability is there. I have a Baby Trend car seat which although it doesn’t click in it sits deep enough in the seats that I think it will work just fine. It’s a little more difficult to get into the back seat but that’s bc it hits the parent storage compartment and cup holder on the handle but I think that would happen with any seat you use. There is only one cup holder for the parent. My single stroller has two which is nice when mom and dad are both out with baby. My other also has an adjustable handle which is nice bc I’m only 5’2” so I use the lower option but this one still seemed comfortable. The window in the back to see the child is low so you have to stoop down to see through it and there isn’t one in the front seat canopy so you can’t see that child if the canopy is up. Folding is simple. It is large and bulky but it’s a double stroller! I still think it’s pretty light for how big and versatile it is.  I saw in a you tube review that when side by side with a jogging stroller that they are very comparable in length when unfolded. When folded my single jogging stroller fits nicely side to side or front to back in the back of my Honda Pilot with the third row down. I think I will be fine with this one but the back seat canopy does not come off which adds 8-10” when folded compared to my jogging stroller so I think fitting it into a car trunk will be tough (my jogging stroller fit but was difficult in my Mazda 6 and it had a large trunk) and I don’t think it will fit front to back in mine. I compared this stroller with Baby Trend sit n stand and Grace Room2Grow and after lots of research chose this one bc Baby Trend front seat didn’t really recline so if carrier in back toddler wouldn’t be able to be comfortable. When carrier in front and using the bench seat the front seat was back so far that space for the child in the bench seat is infringed making him/her sit up straight and looked uncomfortable. There seemed to be similar issues with space between the seats on the Graco option. I think this one will be comfortable for both children regardless which formation you use. My daughter is 2.5yo. She’s small but fit in the back seat comfortably with the front reclined for baby seat. Overall I really like this stroller. I think the few issues I mentioned won’t be that big of a deal, just wanted to point them out so others are aware.Edit: Now that I’ve used it for a month I still love this stroller. I have been using the bassinet/back seat for my newborn so that he is not strapped into his car seat the whole time and he sleeps well plus a bottle, blanket, teddy bear all stay inside. It only has one parent cup holder, 2 would be nice. When back seat is in bassinet style it’s almost impossible to get into the storage basket without taking baby out or make him sit up but you can get to it between the seats. Had it in heavy gravel recently which was difficult but that’s the small wheels compared to my jogging stroller.

  This product is easy to assemble. It is also easy to collapse and open up. Both my kids enjoy riding in it. There are many cup holders and enough compartments for your necessities. This stroller is very long so I would make sure the dimensions fit your car/suv. I use this stroller on bigger field trips and events.

  Awful quality. Was trying to not spend hundreds on a double but the plastic wheels are absolutely garbage and the stroller feels like it can tip over with any movement. I would say if you are looking for something to just push in the mall this will work... anything outside do not buy. Returning.Sucked it up and purchased a BoB double. It’s AWESOME.

    I’m not one to complain but I hate this stroller.
  
",2.0 ,Just me,"Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2018","









  
  
    
  I am so unhappy with this stroller. I thought I would love the large basket underneath but I t’s almost impossible to get anything in.I loved the idea of my toddler and baby being able to face each other but the seats only have 3 point harnesses so my toddler is able to lean forward and reach my baby’s face and head. He tends to spend a lot of time hitting the baby’s feet or trying to poke him in the eyes.I’ve tried sitting them back to back but that’s just as problematic. When my toddler is in the front he presses on the foot rest with his feet and jumps up and down, shaking the stroller. This is again because there’s only a 3 point harness.When the car seat is up on the top it’s almost impossible to see the baby because the seat slots so far inside the fixed seat it is half way under the parent tray on the handle of the stroller and the hood stops me from seeing in. I have to either step to the side to see him, stand on my toes or bend down to look in the peep hole below the handle. All at the same time as my toddler is jumping around.I hate this stroller and have ordered a different one, hoping next time it is more practical.

    User-Friendly, Checks All the Boxes, Can't Beat the Price
  
",5.0 ,SKB,"Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2019","









  
  
    
  I needed a double stroller to transport my infant and contain my three-year-old at the same time. This stroller checked all the boxes, and for a car seat-compatible double stroller, you really can't beat the price.It took maybe 10 minutes to assemble, and it actually seems more maneuverable than my single Graco stroller. I have not had the same difficulty folding it that some other reviewers reported; it took a minute to get the folding motion right, but when I collapse it all the way down, the latch catches with no problem.My 3-year-old fits in the front or back, but I only have him sit in the back because his legs kind of dangle and his feet would hit the front wheels otherwise. I also have to remove the child cup holder from the bar in order to get him in and out easily, but that snaps right on and off.I drive a Nissan Altima, and fully assembled, this stroller is too long to fit in my trunk -- but pop off the front canopy and car seat bar, and it fits fine with space to spare.

  This is a great product for the price. There’s a lot I do like about it. I think the seating for my toddler is great, very roomy. The basket at the bottom holds a lot of stuff. It is a very big stroller of course so it does take up a lot of room, even in the trunk of my Honda CRV so keep that in mind if you have a compact car. It gets four stars because the instructions that come with it do not specifically explain how to click in the infant car seat. I had to find a video on YouTube. Also, it does not have the best capabilities to turn. I need my mother or husband to pick it up from the front while the kids are in it, if I need to turn when there’s not a lot of room for a wide turn. Other than that it does get the job done in hauling my one month old and almost two year old around. I am glad I bought it and did not have to spend a ton of money!

    It's ok, but I wouldn't recommend it
  
",2.0 ,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States October 4, 2018","









  
  
    
  We purchased this stroller as we were expecting our 2nd child when our first was just turning 2.It is compatible with our graco click connect travel system and the price was perfect. (We also weren't able to find anything comparable at our local babies r us).Now we have a 2yr old and a 2wk old and have used the stroller about 10 times.  It was easy enough to put together.  Took my husband about 20mins.  Took about another 20 to figure out how to remove the rear tray so the bucket would snap in.I have 3 major dislikes about this stroller.  1. With my toddler is in the front, if her feet aren't on the foot rest they rob against the wheels and make it hard to drive.  If she sat forward enough her feet could reach the ground.  Shes average height for her age.2. With the bucket in the back, you have to recline the seat to get the bucket in, therefore you lose all access to the large storage compartment.3. Shes a toddler and like to wiggle around and look around at everything, her moving makes the stroller hard to drive also.In closing I probably wouldnt recommend or buy this stroller again, but since we did we will use it until our toddler refuses to go in a stroller, then we will go back to the single stroller.

  This thing is awesome for the price! We have a 2001 Toyota Camry and the stroller fits in our trunk, though it doesn’t leave room for much else.My wife is 4’10”. We clicked our baby’s car seat into the back seat of the stroller, facing backwards (the only way it will go), and she couldn’t see him when standing normally. She had to either go on tippy-toes and lean over the handlebar, or squat down and look through the window. So if she wants to make eye contact with him standing normally, she has to put him in the front seat. Just be aware of that if you’re short.What I love:-Front and back seats both accept Graco click-connect car seats.-It truly does stand up on its own when folded, and it’s surprisingly stable. Not insanely stable (don’t let your kids play around it), but way more than I anticipated.-It’s really fun to drive. Feels like I’m driving a limo.-I love that the back seat can turn into a bassinet for a small baby to lay in. In general, the stroller is very versatile, which makes it fun.-I love that the back seat reclines totally flat. When it’s reclined, you can’t access the cargo area from the main access point, but that hasn’t bugged me yet. I just lift the seat up or pull the cargo out from the side.-Tons of cargo storage space underneath. Way more than what we’re used to.-It’s not too heavy for my 4’10” wife to wrestle into and out of our car.-There’s a tinted plastic window to be able to see into the back seat from the driver’s view.Don’t love:-The rear seat’s sunshade, when pulled fully back, covers the cup holder zone of the person pushing the stroller. If you push the sun shade forward, it will either flop back where it was by itself, or it will fall forward a little, over the kid (and blocking your view of him/her).-The front sunshade leaves a gap between the front and back seats. It’s not as air-tight at the back sun shade. So for example we clicked my baby in the front seat while in his car seat, facing backwards (so looking at us), then extended the car seat’s sun shade all the way it would go, and then extended the stroller’s sun shade all the way it would go. They just barely met in the middle (I’d prefer that the stroller shade overlaps the car seat shade and extends beyond it), and there is still a gap in the back of the stroller’s shade that allows us to see straight into his little zone. This means that on a cold day, we can’t seal him in completely to keep the cold air out, or even rain if it’s windy while raining.-Getting the latch to latch when folding it up is surprisingly difficult for us.-Same thing when opening—I really have to pull hard on the little latch, and I’m scared I’ll pull too hard or in the wrong way and break it.-The front wheels do that thing where they shudder back and forth while you push, but it’s very slight. It could be because of weight distribution, but still it gives the stroller a cheap feel.-The wheels and hubs look like they came from a toy store—very plasticky and much smaller diameter than I anticipated.-If you dangle anything from the handlebars (eg, we have a diaper bag that’s actually a backpack, which we click onto the handlebar to keep it handy), then it will interfere with reclining the back seat down. Bummer.We love the stroller despite its quirks and we’ll run it until it falls to pieces. Thank you Graco for making a Disneyland-compliant double stroller for my family!

  The Graco DuoGlider stroller is pretty good for the price. My two kids fit in it well. My 3 month old sits in the back but he's still kind of small and needs to have extra support to keep him upright. The 2 year old loves the stroller.  My one gripe is that I wish the sun visors covered the kids more. They don't seem to get full sun coverage especially when we go for afternoon walks. On the bright side, The storage underneath the stroller is great and fits a ton of stuff. Like I said before, for the price its a pretty good deal.

  All I can say is THANK YOU GRACO! I love how you can put (Graco) car seats right in there and remove them without waking baby! They are also great because you don’t have to use a car seat, they can sit right in the stroller as in a normal stroller too! I have a one and two year old and mall trips have never been easier! Plenty of storage space underneath the stroller too! Has a cup holder and a place for keys or your phone and each kid has a tray with a cup holder! Love this stroller!

  I bought this double stroller because I have a 3 year old who loves to run if I’m not holding his hand, and when I had my baby I needed him with me. The stroller is perfect for a toddler and baby carrier or two carriers. I use my stroller all the time. I babysit a baby who is same age as my little one, during the week when my toddler is in preschool I use my double stroller with two baby carriers and on the weekends I use it with my toddler. I gave it 4 stars because of the ease of use. It’s easy to fold and unfold and easy to maneuver even while shopping. I left off the last star because it’s a little heavy.

  I am a FTM and recently had twins! When I found out I was having twins I began to look into essential and one being a stroller. I wanted to find a stroller that was versatile and affordable. Seeing how much a double stroller cost at buy buy baby I decided to look on Amazon. When I saw this I made the purchaseI love it! My favorite is that I’m able to just click my babies car seat and boom I’m ready to move. When My twins were discharged  from the hospital I used the stroller to bring them down. It was so easy, even my nurse said I was smart for bringing it in.  My boyfriend loves how smooth it feels. It’s easy to fold and open. I also like that once my girls grow up into the toddler stage I’ll still have this stroller. Honestly for me it was a great investment as a twin mom.

  I really like this stroller. Perfect size for travelling with my 3 year old in front and my 1 year old in the back. I loved the TONS of storage space and it’s easy to access too. The cup holders and storage space for phone on top are awesome. Both seats recline, the back lays flat nicely and the front just enough for keeping my son comfortable. Easy to push, I even ran 5K with it. Folds easily in general. However it does have a few cons: 1. Too heavy and bulky - it’s a monster. Uses up lots of space in my SUV’s trunk. 2. Easy to fold except when the wheels are not aligned. It seems you must lock them before. 3. Optional trays for both seats are loose. They don’t snap on at all and fall off a lot. I ended up losing them in a flight. 4. Won’t fit any airport check in bag. I bought the biggest red check in bag I found to take it on a flight, special for double strollers and this model was listed as compatible. A nightmare to put on and didn’t even cover the whole stroller, it’s massive. On the return flight I didn’t even bother using a bag and that’s when I lost the loose trays. So, in summary: it’s a great stroller and I liked it but it definitely needs improvement. However it is one of the best ones I’ve found that fold in one piece for travelling.

Straight up - not suitable for babies 2. All the way flat. My 3 month old likes to be reclined but not totally flat. There are not shoulder straps so babies are able to topple over when leaning forward. Does great on walks and places like the zoo.

  This is a pretty good double stroller especially for the price. We live overseas (japan) and I literally received my stroller in 5 days. It normally take 10+ on a good day. The only thing that I will say frustrated me is the directions leave out a very important detail in the assembly instructions....the first step is to open the stroller but when you try to do so it doesn’t open. I ended up looking it up on YouTube and viola, there is a latch/lever on the side that you have to release. Once you do the stroller opens with ease and the rest of assembly is easy. Takes about seven minutes to put together.

  So I purchased this stroller so that I could get through standard size doors with my twins. Very easy to maneuver and easy to steer. Second row has less leg room but so far it hasn’t became a problem. I will say, its super long folded and difficult to fit in most standard vehicles... I own an Expedition Max so we have the room now but when we had an Explorer, I had to lay the 3rd row down just to put the stroller in the car. Another issue is the cup holder/umbrella is in the way of my sight and difficult to see my child on the second row.

  Overall this stroller works fine; I mainly chose it because of price and being able to secure my Graco ClickConnect infant seat in it. Assembly was fairly minimal and mostly straightforward. I find it difficult to lock/unlock the stroller; although the lock is somewhat simple in nature I find it difficult to execute. When you put an infant car seat in the rear stroller seat (which is somewhat challenging to click in - and you must remove the child tray which isn't too difficult) the baby is then under the canopy/adult cupholder part and is difficult to view, at least while young (my baby is currently 4 months old). I have thus far only found the viewing window in the back of the stroller to be useful if you're sitting. Therefore, I have to lean forward over the stroller to check on my baby which is not ideal. The basket underneath has sufficient space, although it is difficult but not impossible to access when rear seat is reclined flat. I look forward to using it when I am comfortable with putting my baby in it without a car seat, and hope my toddler doesn't grow out of it for some time.

    Excellent double stroller, but unless you attend Hogwarts good luck fitting in compact car....
  
",5.0 ,Nate Stephens,"Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  With a newborn and a 2 year old, we were looking for something to allow us to take walks again without concern of the older one being hit by a bicycle at Mach 4.  So far, this has been a great purchase to fill that need, I have no complaints with the stroller itself.  However, prior to purchasing we read many reviews and were lead to believe this would fit in the trunk of a Cruze.  Unless Chevy changed trunk sizes in the 2014 model year, I have no idea how anyone is fitting this thing in a Cruze.  They make mailboxes with more cubic feet of space than this car's trunk.  Indeed, I believe there is some type of sorcery involved by anyone claiming to haul this in a compact car.  I took off all the loose parts I could find and it was obvious this thing had as much a chance of fitting in that trunk as I do of fitting into my old jeans from high school.  On the plus side, now I won't have to wait for my mid-life crisis to buy a full size truck, as this was clearly a sign to my better half that my ""want"" is actually closer to a ""need"".

  I honestly do not understand how this has such great reviews. I have the graco car seat that is compatible with this and there is nowhere for it to snap into the front and the back seat was too small for the car seat to fit. I ended up just setting the car seat in the front even though it wasn’t snapped in. My son who is 2 1/2 sat in the back and was very uncomfortable. It was very small and every time we took him out his shoes would pop off cause there wasn’t any room. Once folded down it was very long and just barely fit in the back of my car which is a small suv. I had high hopes for this and I was let down. I returned it and bought a different brand which I love!

  Great stroller. Great to use, love the storage, love the design and the drink trays. I don't like the adult drink holder and little tray. It is so tiny that nothing significant really fits in it. Definitely not all drinks. other than that, which can be supplemented with a hanging organizer its great. Except only on concrete/cement/carpet/tile/vinyl etc. Definitely not good offroading or on trails. Definitely need a jogging stroller for that.

  The front doesn’t recline far enough back, but that’s understandable since you need leg room for the rear child. It’s rather large, and makes it difficult to Maneuver  if you have the larger child up front. This means the baby in the car seat need to be in the front, and not closest to you

My husband has to be around for me to use it. Its hard to pack things on the basket underneath. Well, the car seat and or kids have to be out before putting anything in the basket and taking things out. It took us a while to figure out that you have to take the tray off to hook the car seat on.

  We have this stroller and we combine it with the Graco SnugRide 30 Cick Connect. It is just perfect to be able to place the baby in either one of the spots, as our toddler likes to sit in the front sometimes, and in the back sometimes.The reason I'm taking one star off, is because me and my wife can never seem to be able to fully collapse the stroller, as there is always something 'in the way' for the full collapsing. Maybe it's just me and it is unfair to take one star off because we could be doing soemthing wrong, but it just adds up to my point - it's not easy and intuitive to do it.All in all we are very happy with it.

  Works great for my toddler and newborn. It is a bit long, but it maneuvers so well I can take it anywhere. Just fits in elevators.Only con is, when the baby is placed on the section nearest the handles, you cannot access the storage underneath easily. This is because you have to fold down the seat and the portion that folds down covers the opening to the storage below.

  Just set up our stroller a couple hours ago. My wife and I love it, and so does our oldest son (he made me take him for a walk) it's clean, nice looking, and our car seat works perfectly with it, it's easy to set up and take down. The only problem I have with it, which is reason behind the 4 stars is that I have to take the front tray completely off for it to latch when I fold it up. I don't know if it's suppose to be that way, if something was done wrong in the building of it, or if it's user error, but 2 more  centimeter and it would work perfectly. I just feel like having to take something off to put it into my car is a pain, and a good way for me to lose something. For the most part, it is a great stroller, for an amazing price, and I'm sure our baby will love it when it's born.

  This is a decent product for the price but as is usually the case, you get what you pay for. I find that it's very heavy and bulky. With a third row SUV I have to have the third row down to fit this is the trunk and even then it takes up almost all of the space in a Honda Pilot. It is also quick finicky to close it up. If everything is perfectly in place it wont close and then gets stuck and it is hard to reopen. The leg rest in the front is positioned so that my toddler has his knees very close to him which he doesnt seem to mind but looks terribly uncomfortable. The rear seat is also either very straight up or all the way lowered to a lying down position with no in between which makes it very difficult to put an infant in. My five month old slumps over in the seat becuase it's too straight and of course he doesn't want to lie down where he cant see anything.Overall it seems like it is sturdy and will last but probably wouldnt buy this again.

This stroller is very easy to push, the turn radius is phenomenal and I am just impressed all the way around with these products. If you're having twins,triplets or anything above, buy this stroller. I was extremely skeptical at first but now I couldn't be happier! When trying to put 2 carseat in, it's a little tricky to figure out at first but the small cup holder for the second seat closest to who ever is pushing, comes apart to fit the carseat on and that's how it clicks in.

  The only down side to this product that I have experienced is the locking mechanism to keep it from opening by itself once you have folded it for travel/storage. Other than that it has wheels that lock to keep straight, or you can keep them unlocked for swiveling & turns. Lots of room for storage underneath and a little pocket to hold your phone/keys and drink while you walk... although the pocket is too small to completely close with my iPhone 6 inside of it, I am still satisfied.

  A bit trick to assemble - watch a youtube video. especially to get the bottom basket - fold up the stroller partway to get it completely on. also, to put a car seat on - you need to separate the cup holders and add that on to the stroller. That's not really explained well in the manual. otherwise, we've used it for our 10 week old (in car seat in front) and almost 3 year old (in back). the stroller is longer with that configuration but it seemed better. the front seat for the toddler didn't seem as comfortable and also more squished for the baby. It folds very easily but does require some oomph to pull it apart - perhaps we are doing it wrong? There is one cup holder and one storage area for the parents.

The first time we used the stroller was for a 4 hour trip. The stroller was great until the 2nd time we needed it.

That's the only damage we've incurred.  That said, the stroller is great.  I like how narrow it is (it fits through doorways and fits on the sidewalk).  It's easy to maneuver.  The option to snap in the car seats is glorious, especially when they are newborns. It folds down pretty easily, and it's not too heavy to carry.  My only complaint is that the there is limited storage.  The basket underneath doesn't hold much and is awkward.  And... well... at 10 months my kids are close to outgrowing it.

So glad the brand has retained it's high quality and affordability too.

  Good quality double stroller but isn’t exactly compact- takes up the entire trunk of my 4 door Ford Focus. It does work very well for a toddler and I enjoy that I can put the Greco infant car seat in the back which attaches perfectly.! Excellent price and much lighter in weight than similar stroller which go for $1,000 more dollars than this $180.00 one.

  Better than I expected. Works perfectly for my infant and 2 year old, either by clicking in the car seat or by laying the rear seat back to use as a bassinet.  Lots of easily accessible storage underneath and actually maneuvers better than my previous Graco modes click connect.  Would recommend for anyone looking for a dual stroller compatible with the click connect system.

  This stroller does not have a 5 point restraint. This is a large problem. My grandson is a toddler and its dangerous for him to be without that restraint. My husband will install one. This is very disappointing you would think that a company like Graco would have the safety of children in mind.

  We bought this stroller because we have a 18month old and a newborn. we thought it would be better to go long, rather than wide when it came to double stroller.  Well when we bought it we enjoyed it was lightweight compared to others, and borke down easily. But after 1 year of use and maybe 20 or less times out of the house it broke. The wheel at the front popped off. Then we repaired it and the other one on the opposite popped off next. We dont drive it on rough terrain, just cement and street. But the 1 time we took it over grass at a park.... from then it has never been the same. Now i am on the hunt for a side by side.So, even though the price was right. i should have spent more money, because in the end i am having to buy another one. Was not worth it.

  It does not push as smooth as a jogger but are walks still are primarily on gravel and it works well. It fits much better in my car than my jogger which is why I switched. It folds up for the most part with one hand but I find to get it to lock together I do have to use one hand to push the latch to proper position while pushing down with the other.

  So, if you want a double stroller that can accept an infant car seat, this is about the lightest and most compact out there.  Those were the two defining factors for our family choosing this double stroller.  It was super convenient that it was also the most economic.Again, if you don't require your double stroller to connect with an infant car seat, there are plenty of other options that are much lighter.Pros:  I have been using our stroller for a bit over a month now.  I am quite impressed with the maneuverability. We switch up who sits where depending on our needs. That means I have tried out maneuverability with the heavier child both in front and in the back, as well as our four year old in the front seat.  My four year old in the front seat does greatly change the ease of pushing.  However, we bought this stroller for our newborn and two year old.  I have driven this in dirt and over sand (with only our infant in the stroller), and have found it to be no problem.  I drive in and out of doors by myself with my two younger children in the stroller and have found it easy to pass through a single door with no stags.  If our two year old is likely to want to sleep, we place him in the back seat., otherwise we sit him in the front.  Another bonus feature is the rear seat turns into a bassinet.  We use this bassinet feature often, since we live in SW Florida and it is cooler for our infant vs the infant car seat.  Also I really appreciate that the front seat sun shade pivots, so the front passenger can always escape our scalding hot sun.Cons (and constructive criticism): So as to folding and storage I give this a four star...only because I have tried out three other double strollers. for a travel system style this is about as good as you get.  I have only in the past week successfully locked/hooked/latched this stroller in its folded state.  It was a real bear up until recently when both my husband and I started to notice that it was becoming easier.  I can only hope this will keep improving with use, as not being able to lock a folded stroller is a huge pain in the back (for real).  Is it light? No! Is it light in comparison with others that serve the same function, yes.  So don't gripe about a double travel system stroller being heavy. At least for now the options are heavy, heavier and Plymouth Rock.  I finally was able to lock it by placing it against my trunk and leaning into it to latch it closed.  The photos  provided show how we travel with the stroller in our Honda Odyessey.  So I can only hope this may help some of you out there gain space in your trunks.  As you can see we use a bungee cord wrapped around the stroller and hooked around the metal polls of the seat headrest.Also I wish these companies would sit down with me so I could design a super star stroller, or at least to have an engineer explain why some basic adjustments are not possible.  For example: why are sunshades not full coverage?! (like in the Zoe's strollers) As far as I can tell it would only be the addition of cloth and maybe a zipper.  It is super annoying trying to keep the sun off of my infant in the bassinet on a sunny breezy day....as the blanket method turns more complicated. also why can the front seat not be taller, to accommodate an older child more comfortably?  Also why does the rear seat only have seating and lay flat positions?  My single graco stroller (That I still love and use with baby #3) has a single hand press that allows for any recline that I find convenient.  And finally I would like to understand why, in 2019, double strollers must still be so heavy to accommodate an  infant stroller when my graco single is only 17lbs and Zoe's double (not infant carseat adaptable) is 17 lbs....it seams that there should be a way to make it work.I am content with our purchase and see this as being a great options, not just for the price.  Pricier strollers could not be that much better to make the substantial price difference worth it.

  It's a decent stroller, easy to maneuver and holds both my 2 year old (almost 3) and 1 month old with no issues. However if you need to store this, it's nearly impossible to get it to latch and unlatch. It feels like it's going to break, watched YouTube videos to make sure that I wasn't missing anything and others had mentioned it as well. I already have the Graco 35 Elite carseat though so I can't really return them.

  This is not a user friendly stroller. The design has you taking several steps to collapse after use. It also is difficult to access an infant in a car seat connected to it.(we have the compatible car seat) If you have an infant seat in the back seat of the stroller you have no access to the storage underneath. Also if the infant seat is in the back you don’t have full use of the cup holder unless the handle to the infant seat is down. Also the leg room as the children get older is not ideal, we are currently looking for a new one now that the boys are older

  Easy to maneuver, folds down to basically the same size as our single rider Graco modes. It’s not too heavy, easy to fold, both the kids are comfortable. It’s true you can’t access the basket when the baby car seat is clicked in in back. Buy a hook for $7 until your kid gets out of the infant car seat. Or put baby in the front. For $125, I will deal with these minor issues. I’m sure they will fix this issue w a future model, like just make the basket material stretchy so you can get in a little easier. All in all, wonderful. Don’t spend more.

  Incredibly disappointed in this purchase. I have a click connect car seat and it DOES NOT connect in any way shape or form.  I’ve tried, my husband tried, and my mom tried.  The cup holders are too shallow and my toddlers sippy cup falls out on the ground constantly. Any little pebble will lock up the wheels. I live in a city with alleys so lots of rocks, constantly having to shift and back up for this thing to go over gravel of any sort. Will not work on trails at all!!  Smooth concrete only required. When it folds, it will not lock as described. It is so hard to get it to lock that it is IMPOSSIBLE. It is so heavy I can’t lift into car alone. It takes two people. Also any I level ground, it is so heavy with kiddos in it that it takes two people to steer it. Wished I wouldn’t have bought. Can’t return now. Had to use it bc I came home with kiddo number two and had complications in and out of hospital myself so I had no time or physical ability to return for something else.

  It fits my 16 month old (in the front) and newborn in the back in his car seat. You can do it the opposite way, but we didn't want her playing with him. I see it very easily accommodating the both of them for years.It's not too bad to drive, but due to its size is frustrating over difficult terrain. But it was very doable over grass, and on bike paths is very easy.It's lighter than I expected, but is still awkward and heavy when collapsed. It doesn't always collapse with one try and you (rarely) have to get the wheels lined up (they usually do it on their own). The one handed operation advertised is possible, but not quite as effortlessly as shown.The worst part is trying to wheel it while collapsed. The basket gets in the way and you have to cart it at an awkward angle. But it will freestand due to the basket's placement so, I guess it's a good trade.Definitely like it overall.

  It took me almost the time I had an ultrasound til a few weeks ago to purchase this stroller. I am over satisfied but I'll list my pro's and con's on it:*pros*1) It is very easy to open and close! I can shove my twins in the car and fold it and throw it where I need to throw it2) It is super easy to drive! I can handle tight spots and easily whip this stroller around to catch a runaway toddler with ease.3) The glorious amount of tray and cup holder space! I can shove snacks and easily use one of those tie on sippy cups for the twins. I also have 1 cup holder and a small closed compartment for carkeys, loose change, etc. It's not big enough for a 8"" cellphone but it works!4) You HAVE access to the basket! About 80% of stroller brands don't have an easy access basket. Hence why it took months for me to purchase this one... I can easily grab a blanket or whatever from down there and also shove it right back in.*Con's*1) The locking mechanism doesn't always work. I drive an SUV so locking this stroller is essential to shoving it on my hitch or the back of my husband's car.2) The stroller's locking mechanism design. My stroller that uses the infant carrier had a lock that easily slid down to a pen. All you had to do was slid the plastic hole over one of those bolts and it was locked and STAYED lock. This stroller ""clips"" close. You have to have the wheels in the right position and almost sit on it to clip close. It's very frustrating!3) It's heavy! I don't mind the weight so much actually but going back to the way the lock mechanism is designed, it makes it a nightmare!4) I probably won't be able to use this stroller for long. Having twins means money can be tight and because the seat straps don't stretch very far I think this'll be good for maybe til the twins are 18 months. They're already able to whip around and pull themselves halfway out the seats because of their height and weight at 10 months old. It's not a huge concern NOW but when they get older it'll be harder for me to keep a chubby baby in their seat!All in all this isn't a bad stroller for my budget. It safely carries my babies around and is easy to use.

  I use this product with my 2 year old and 3 month old, and I have been using it since my younger child was born. I love that the back seat lays flat for the baby, reclines very far back on the front seat, and that it will grow with my kids. This stroller is great in malls, because of the inline design, and would be great at a theme park or zoo with mostly flat ground and no bumps. This stroller is great for the price, however there are a few things I wish I would have known about before purchasing:I wish the front seat were a little taller, my son is on the short side, and still hits the back of his head on the back seat's tray when the front seat is reclined.Trying to get it up any bumps is challenging, because the back seat recline is so far out over the storage area and back tires that it catches my knee cap as I try to put pressure on the back tires to 'wheelie' the front tires up. I also found that it tries to tip to the side a lot if using it for walks around the neighborhood where the sidewalk slants for driveways. Now we just walk in the road to avoid this issue.The parent compartment doesn't hold much, and would honestly work better if it was just an open area. The cup holder is too shallow to really hold any beverage, and water bottles have fallen onto the back seat's sun canopy when going over the slightest bump.While I love that the back seat goes so flat, I don't love that the recline function for the seat requires two hands to engage. (A catch system located on either side). It would be much more convenient with the same recline system used on the front seat, since the child in the back seat is usually in my arms to begin with, and the seat has to be locked in the upright position for the stroller to lock folded. Speaking of which, while it is easy to fold, it is not easy to get it to latch closed. We found we had to have both seats in the upright position, fold it, and then basically kneel on it to get it to latch. While doable, it was a bit frustrating until we figured it out.Basically, if you plan to use the stroller for trips and family outings to flat places, and just need something the contain your children comfortably, this would be great for you! If you like to walk around the neighborhood and need something that can easily go over small bumps like the entry to the front of your house, and maneuver well over driveway slants, you may want to look elsewhere.

Easy to install. Only concern is that my older one who is 5yo is pretty tall. She finds it hard to get in and get out of the stroller with the cup holder. Other than that- we liked the product.

Super convenient to take walks with the kiddos during the day and with my husband when he’s back from work and the dog can join us on a family walk. It’s not very heavy, folds quickly to put aside, a lot of room in the carriage underneath...can’t find much of an issue with it! Glad we got it. I’ve had it for over month now and we love it. Walks almost every day with it and haven’t run into any issues.

  I did quite a bit of searching to find the right double stroller for my toddler and infant. I’ve been very happy with my purchase. What do I love about this double stroller? It’s easy to push. It fits through door ways. Both of my children can sit comfortably. The sun shade in the front can move all the way down to block the sun out of my child’s face if we are walking directly into the sun. It’s easy to fold up. I also love that the bottom basket it really large.What do I not like as much? This thing is huge! The dimensions are listed in the product description so I wasn’t surprised by the size. I knew what I was buying. This is my second Graco stroller and the first one (classic single) is also pretty big. It’s just a little bit heavy and large to lug around. That said we successfully and easily took it with us onto 3 airplanes and can fit it in the back of our midsize SUV. It won’t fit in the trunk, but the front sun shade and also the front panel are removable and can help shrink the size down a bit if trying to fit it into a smaller space. For us though, I knew it would fit in my vehicle and the size was with the space for my kids to comfortably sit. I also wish this had a little window on the top to look and peek on my kids. And I really wish the seats had more than two seat position options. My first graco stroller had a strap that would allow the seat to partially recline. The front seat is either all the way up or partially reclined. The back seat is either all the way up or all the way down. There is no in between.Overall we like it. It does it’s job. My kids have enjoyed it too.

Wish the bassinet style for babies could face backwards - there is a viewing window but hard to see the child’s face is they are taller and farther back.

  Love this stroller for the price! It’s super easy to maneuver even though it’s a long double stroller. It turns pretty tight and glides smoothly. The basket below is nice and large. I agree with other reviews if you have the back seat reclined you can’t really access the basket easily but it hasn’t been a big deal. I will say the back seat tray is a bit tight. When my 28 lb toddler sits in that seat the tray is very close to her body.  The front seat is not like that. I like that the back seat reclines flat for a bassinet for my 2 month old however it only has 2 positions: up and flat. I wish there was also an in between. Not enough of a complaint for me to hate it. Seats only have a 3 point harness not a 5 point - I wish it did for more support for the baby in a sitting position. Overall, I would recommend this stroller.

    Dad review - Take note of these two things before purchasing!
  
",5.0 ,Brad B.,"Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2017","









  
  
    
  Great 2 baby stroller - there are not harness seat belts on either seat, however!!! They are just the t style seat belts that go across the lap and one strap through the legs. We are a bit nervous to put our 5 month old in the front or back - it will work perfectly once he can sit up and support his body well. (Our almost 4 year old can sit in either seat with some headroom to spare.) The way we are remedying the little one's sitting is to purchase a graco car seat now - that will click in the back position easily. We have Chicco brand car seat travel system now, but just the Chicco tandem stroller is more expensive than buying two new Graco pieces that will work together so we are biting the bullet and replacing our car seat too.Ok - the other item to take note of is that both seats ""recline"". The front seat just by a couple of inches and the back seat has two positions only - either sitting straight up or laying completely flat (the flat position covers up the lower cargo area). This will be great for naps in a few months as that is usually when we need a stroller for two anyways.These two things may be concerns for some reading, but had I even known I still would have purchased at this price. It is a very nice easy to push tandem stroller. The colors are non-offensive and low key. I highly recommend this for anyone not willing to make a huge investment in something two or three times the price but that want something that is not an umbrella stroller with handle bars two feet across. I am 5'10 and my wife is 5'6 - we can both push easily.Tip: To save some money we bought open box and were very pleased with amazon warehouse. It was brand new and great condition - we bought the ""like new"" option. The new price on this is outstanding as well, so I understand someone maybe not wanting to take the gamble. I hope this helps other dads!

I am pleasantly surprised how smooth it is and my boys absolutely love being able to sit in the same stroller together.  I also love how large the bottom basket is, as it is the size of the full length of the stroller.  When my husband and I take walks with the kids, we no longer have to worry about getting out of the way for other pedestrians, as the stroller is slim.  Of course it's not perfect (no hand-brakes, cheaper materials, doesn't take bumps well), but I wasn't expecting perfection for the price tag.  If you are looking for an affordable stroller to use on pedestrian-friendly walks and places like malls, this is a great option!

I purchased this one because it's much cheaper than most of the other double strollers out there.  So, you get what you pay for.Pros:- A lot of storage space underneath the seats that is easy to access- Back seat reclines all of the way so I can take baby out of car seat and lay him down on his back in the stroller to sleep or to let him stretch out- Toddler can choose which seat they want (the baby car seat fits in either seat)- Assembly is easyCons:- Very long - it just barely fits in a station wagon trunk- Difficult to lock in the car seat.

  I am fairly disappointed with this stroller.  When the car seat is locked into position it is difficult to get the baby out of the seat if needed due to the position of the umbrella and rear cupholder.  When the top umbrella is folded backward and not in use it pushes against any cups in the cupholder and drinks can tip out.  The child cupholders in the front are very shallow and do not work well with many sippy cups.  It is bulky and difficult to maneuver. Being that I am only 5’1  I am not able to see my toddler sitting in the front seat when I am pushing the stroller.  The front seat is low enough and positioned over the wheels such that my toddler is able to rest his feet on top of the wheels.  It has only three point harnesses instead of five point harnesses.  And when folded for storage it does not stay closed.

  I cannot tell if my 3 year old is comfortable in the front seat. It seems that the front seat itself isn't as large as the single strollers. I like the foldability and the spacious back seat. My younger child is able to sleep easily and stays buckled in the back seat. There is a lot of space in the storage underneath, it is easily accessible (only when the back seat is propped up).I like the parent compartment near the handle but you cannot fit anything larger than iPhone 5s but it's good for your on-the-go snacks. Sometimes it's hard to unfold it with one hand. And you have to ensure the wheels are aligned when folding it. It fits any sedan trunk but diagonally and you cannot store any other large items.I liked that it wasn't too pricey cause you get what you pay for and it's not a Bugaboo stroller.

  Perfect stroller for us with a newborn and a 2 yr old. The car seat clicks right in to the back seat and our two year old rides happily in the front. Doesn’t have a ton of cargo space underneath but that’s understandable.  A couple notes on folding it down: the front wheels MUST be facing forward and the front seat MUST be in the reclined position and you shouldn’t have anything in the underneath cargo space. This info isn’t in the manual but it should be. Good luck!

  This is a nice lightweight stroller for 2 babies/toddlers. I have the graco car seat as well that’s pops right in. I like how easy it is to breakdown and how lightweight it is since I drive a truck and need to put it in the back, it doesn’t break my back to do so! Good price too comparing all other options on the market.

  I really like this stroller! Way easier to maneuver than the Chicco Bravofor2 . The reason we bought this stroller because we wanted something that turns easy and this is it! Also easy for loading and unloading. Back seat fully reclines. Even my 5 year old can sit in the front and back. He's about 42 lbs and my daughter is 31 lbs and they both together were easy to push compared to my newborn and toddler in the old stroller. I'm very pleased so far. I've used it about 6 times

  Great for the price we paid.  It's really light weight and easy to fold.  Love the large basket underneath...very convenient if you need to lug around a lot of stuff on your outing.  The material is really cheap feeling.  We actually had to send for a replacement, because the first one they sent us had a tear in the material on one of the canopies, and then underneath the front chair.  The other con is that it's really long...so, if you don't have a big trunk, the stroller probably won't fit.  We have a Yukon, so it fits just right, but literally butts up to each end.  Other than that, it does what it needs to do, and it's affordable.

I think it’s a good stroller. Just wish I had another cup holder for outings such as the zoo or park. And easier access to storage.

  This thing is a life saver!! Had some trouble putting it together because the instructions were pictures only (maybe a couple words, I don't remember now) and one thing they don't specify is to flip the stroller upside down when installing the wheels. Something about the angle they go in prevents it from locking in place unless it's flipped. My toddler loves the front, and the back is super easy to use with the click connect car seat. I read a lot of reviews saying it is difficult to fold up, I completely disagree. It's a standard 3 step process like most other strollers. I have a Nissan versa note (very small, think Honda fit) and it fits in the trunk but only if you take off the front tray which isn't a big deal to me. Very well designed.

  It’s okay. It’s super long and heavy. When you want to close it you have to use both hands to move the front seat of your child is sitting in it with a car seat. It makes me wish I could have bought the $600 city select double stroller. This Grace stroller needs two hands to set up and takes time and you have to have muscle to lift it. Many times it has hit me in the shin. And it won’t fold up unless the chairs are in a certain position. Also the cup holders are too shallow so the kids drink just falls out ALL the time and no matter what. For a small budget this will get you by.UPDATED SINCE* It’s been almost a year and I hate this stroller. I loath setting it up. Doesn’t keep my kids in. They slide out and the clear plastic “window” to see your child in a car seat is awful. I can’t see I’m your other child in the front seat either. Save your money. Don’t buy this unless you really have to settle.

  I am so pleased with the purchase of this stroller.  It was a snap to set up.  My toddler loves it and also likes the fact that she's facing the infant car seat and can see her brother! :)Folding it is super simple.  The only issue is getting it folded enough to lock.  Spin the front wheels around until they nestle into the stroller.  Then it will lock.  It's a bulky stroller, but I expected that, as it is a double stroller.  However, it stands up on its own, and fits in a corner of my laundry room quite nicely.  It's not overly heavy.  However, you will need substantial trunk space to fit it into your vehicle.All in all, I feel it's a quality product and exactly what I was looking for.

  I use the stroller with a graco car seat and it works great in either position. The rear window can open and the accessory tray and canopy can be removed if desired. You can customize this stroller many different ways if you examine it carefully, I've been impressed. It's relatively lightweight and maneuvers easily on sidewalks and gravel, etc. The only thing I don't like is the slight recline of the rear toddler seat, I feel like my little one struggles to sit up straight unless I add a pillow for support and because of that slight recline she's constantly sliding down.  The front seat seems a much better position for good posture and comfort, but the snack tray sticks very far out leaving a lot of room to drop toys and making it difficult to reach snacks.  Still, I can't imagine a better stroller for two little ones.

And then nearly body slam it to get it to “close” and there is no click to know it has closed in fold position.To open from folding you have to use both hands and basically turn the handle while also throwing the stroller in front of you- not easy to do while 8 months pregnant nor can I imagine doing so alone with multiple kids.The car seats do Click into the stroller seats- you have to separate the cup holders from the “bar” under them to clip the car seat into position. Maybe I’ve missed it in the manual but I saw NO mention of that period.Maybe I got the crapshoot and mine cane defective 🤷🏻‍♀️ Returning this massive beast would be not worth it unless I can take it to a store or free return shipping.Not looking forward to using this at all now.The basket is nice.

She loves to sit facing her sister so the can giggle and smile at one another.

They both have their own trays as well as a cup holder and tray for me. Their is a ton of storage room as well.

  This stroller is very nice quality. I was pleasantly surprised because my last double stroller was a baby trend sit n stand that was horrible and I paid more for that one.. the quality sucks, barely used it in the year we had it and a bunch of parts broke. Biggest plus about this Graco stroller is it fits in my trunk! My last one didn’t so I had to put down my 3rd row which is unacceptable with 3 car seats. I do wish I could leave the trays and cover on it to fold it and have it fit but that’s a minor inconvenience for this very necessary stroller! It’s also lighter than my last double stroller so very happy about that, was much easier for me to lift into my SUV.

However once you figure it all out, piece of cake.There is a decent amount of leg room the one problem I would note and that is it's best if the kids are barefoot going into the stroller, my kids shoes constantly get stuck if sitting in the back seat.All in all I prefer this over a side by side stroller, and better than the sit-n-go.

  I got this as I already had the click connect infant seat and single stroller. When my family expanded, I need to grow 1 more space. This allowed me to do just that. The collapsing is somewhat of an art, backup so the wheels turn around and then fold it down. The clip for the collapsing always concerns me and is sometimes hard to get undone. My 11mo old infant in the back enjoys messing with my older son's hair in the front (perhaps I should switch them around, but this gives you an idea of the closeness of back to front).The click infant car seat worked perfect into this unit. Very easy to get in an out. Was a little tight in the back with space though.The cup holders for the unit pop off fairly easy, my kids have learned this and turned it into a ""how many times can I make daddy mad doing this"" sort of game...

  Love this stroller! Great deal for a double. It fits perfectly in the trunk of my mid-sized sedan with room for groceries still. It is easy to fold and unfold and easy to assemble. Came with all the parts I expected (I know some ppl have said that theirs was missing the arms for the tray tables?? I did not have this issue). I have a 2y and a 1y and both love being pushed around in this. The basket is the best part! Nice and big as far as stroller baskets go, and pretty easy to access when the back seat is up (I hardly ever recline it. If I do need the infant capsule In the stroller, I put it in the front seat). Easy to manouevre. Just hard to go up on a curb but that’s a common issue with non-jogging tires/strollers.Overall very happy with it.

  After I had my second child and I found myself carrying my 2 year old and a car seat at the same time, I knew it was time for a double stroller. This came to the rescue! Easy to set up, easy to fold and easy to lift! It fits perfectly in my Honda CR-V. If you have a smaller car but a wide trunk, it should fit also. When it folds, it is not bulky, just long - obviously. So the wider a trunk, the better. The basket underneath is very spacious (I love it), so spacious I am surprised at the number of things that can fit there. The only thing I overlooked was the 5 point harness strap. It made sense why it was cheaper when I compared with other strollers. Still, it functions just fine for me, anyway.

  2.5 year old sits in front and she doesn't seem comfortable. I have an 8 month old also and both struggle with sitting properly since there aren't chest straps with the seat belt. It's my biggest complaint since both kids slide down and 2 year old has accessibility to outside items at the store instead of being 'strapped down.""

  We got this yesterday and used it right away at the mall. Worked nicely, fit a car seat and my 4 yr old. Was kinda worried about it not fitting my 4 yr old but he could sit in the front or the back. He sat in the back mostly cause the seat is bigger but you have the recline the front seat for the car seat to fit which gave him less leg room but it was fine, he didn't complain. Was also able to fit it in our trunk which is a Buick so a little bigger trunk than normal. Nice big basket on the bottom. Was able to shop at target without a cart. Moves and turns very smooth too. So I'm glad it worked out because I mainly got it to fit both kids especially at street fairs and events for the summer.

  The backseat is not positioned correctly and my 18 month old would always slide right down into the basket. It’s almost like it is at an incline. And I could not get my children out of the back without struggling with their feet. The tray is like too low and it is hard to get their feet out. And unless you position the canopies just right the stroller does not click together when folded. I would not recommend.

  I had researched what double stroller would be best for our family the moment I found out I was pregnant with our 2nd. I honestly thought I was going to love it... I have only had it fo almost 6 months and the fabric is already ripping... i don’t even use often. One time I took the kids to their doctors appointment and the stroller got jammed and wouldn’t open. I looked like the biggest idiot trying to wedge it open with my leg and arms. Luckily someone saw I was struggling and helped. the stroller made us late.One time when I was on a walk with my kids and wanted to jog down a hill to make toddler laugh but the front wheels couldn’t handle the speed started Wiggin out on me. I get that’s why people buy jogger strollers but my last regular stroller handled a little speed just fine.The Stroller is huge and is more than half my size when folded. (I’m 5’3”)The stroller overall is okay it. It will get the job done but if I could go back I would buy a different one. Hands down.

  This folds and unfolds easily with one hand and is compact when folded. The storage area is great and sturdy and roomy. The instructions are horrible. Note...to use the quick click bucket feature, you have to separate the tray from the rail/bar it is clicked in to. Unlike a single  stroller of the same brand where the bucket clicks in to the cup holder tray/bar in its entire form, this one, you have to separate the plastic tray from the bar.The annoying function is the front wheels, even with a 30 pound toddler in the front have a tendency to wobble and not track straight...king of like that bunk shopping cart you get at the grocery store. Otherwise, this is a good stroller and manageable enough to take on a plane trip.

It doesn’t just fold close, you have to remove the visor(cover), the rear cup holder, and the rear seat bar for it to fold over enough to fit in your trunk.

    Many Pros! LOVE this stroller
  
",5.0 ,Zandy,"Reviewed in the United States April 29, 2018","









  
  
    
  LOVE this stroller so far! Trust the good reviews. Its affordable compared to others and made as well as a double stroller can be made in my opinion. I spent days researching double strollers and I'm glad I picked this one! Reasons I chose this stroller and what I love about it:- Comfortability is perfect for the age difference of my kids. I have a newborn and I have an extremely tall 2 year old; shes as big as or bigger than most 3- 4 year olds and fits this perfectly, plus room to grow. I really didn't want my overgrown toddler to feel crammed. (I was originally between this and the BabyTrend Double Stroller to avoid something too bulky but I saw it in person at the store and felt like the front seat was just too small. I was also  between this and the Sit and Stand double strollers, but this is MUCH more suitable for younger toddlers who will still want to nap or just sit back on long trips or walks.)- GREAT SIZE. For a double stroller this one really is not that bulky or heavy! Handling this stroller is hassle free and fits in compact vehicle trunks just fine with room to spare. Yes, it's a little long but cmon guys it's a DOUBLE stroller, expect that when in the market for these. I noticed it's shorter if I have the car seat in the rear and my toddler in the front. The bottom storage basket is also spacious.-Assembly was easy with simple instructions. I was over 40 weeks pregnant and put it together by myself no problem. Just follow the manual.-Ease of use. It really does fold up nicely with one hand and stands on its own. Also opens up easily. In order for it to fold up nicely I do suggest removing the kids cup holder trays and front shade visor, which is super easy. Kind of like how it comes when you take it out of the box.- Maneuvers extremely well! I cut all kinds of sharp narrow corners with this thing.- Design and Reclining Features. I LOVE that the rear seat reclines all the way and has a fold up flap to enclose it completely. Perfect for laying a smaller baby down for a nap. The front seat also reclines well enough for a toddler to nap in (if there isn't a car seat in the rear).- Accessories. All these cupholder trays are awesome to have! Very convenient for every one. Just not sure how well the cup holders will fit the size of certain sippy cups though. But definitely not a deal breaker when it comes to buying one of these.Now for the cons I've found so far:- No shoulder straps! Only harnesses across their lap and between their legs. I read about it before buying. This was almost a deal breaker for me but my toddler is big enough for me not to worry about it too much. Not sure how this will affect my newborn as he grows into a bigger baby though.- As other reviewers noted, you can't really get into the bottom basket if the rear seat is reclined... which is how it has to be if you want a car seat in the rear seat close to you or if baby is asleep there.-Not much leg room for a child in the rear seat if a car seat is in the front. This makes it hard for my toddler to get out and her shoe comes off every time I try to pull her out. However it's kinda useful when I take them to out the stores and I want my toddler to stay put cus she literally can't get out ;pOther than that I didn't notice any problems or deal breakers for my preference. This review is completely based on my own experience and opinions. Overall I would highly recommend this product to a family in search of a spacious, durable, light weight double stroller. I've only been using it for a couple months but I can't imagine what I'd do without it now!

  This is okay. The cup holders are super shallow so anything in them pops right out if you go over a bump or are walking it on bricks or a dirt path. The backseat that reclines for infants doesn’t have a lot of leg room, and when it’s reclined back it’s absolutely impossible to get into the bottom net. Sometimes it clicks shut when I fold it and sometimes it doesn’t. Also the shades are very small and don’t keep the sun out. But the seats are padded well and easy to clean. But it is pretty light considering how big it is.

  This is a dangerous stroller, it's a pain in the *** to unfold as the latch is poorly designed.

  This is great for taller people, and those with a long stride. I don't kick the axle at all, even at a decently fast pace. A few minor complaints: the rear canopy isn't vented and becomes a sail in the wind, really increasing the force needed to push the stroller. I can't figure out how to get it to latch folded up. The seats do not have adjustable recline, so your infant needs good body control to be able to sit in it.I would definitely buy it again.

  I can't wait to use this stroller! I have 1 1/2 year old and a baby due in a month. I researched lots of different double strollers and chose this one because of the Graco Click connect "". I had a Graco car seat carrier from my first baby and I love how easily it snaps into the stroller. The wheels were very easy to snap on and everything was pretty simple to figure out. The trickiest part is knowing to snap on the cup holder bar, but take off the actually cup holder in order to snap the car seat in (I knew what to do thanks to previous reviews). I also tried wheeling my toddler out a short distance and it seemed easy to steer.My biggest fear when ordering this stroller was finding out if it would fit into our ""compact"" vehicles. We have a 2008 Toyota Yaris and a 2014 Ford Focus. The Focus has a smaller trunk, but it fit in both! I mean, it takes over most of the trunk space, but it was expected being a double stroller. It's a little challenging for me to get it in the car being 8 months pregnant, but my husband was able to fit it in with no problem. Overall, I'm extremely happy with the price and quality of this stroller.

  Easy to put up and down.  I have it set up with the baby carrier in the back closest to me but because of the height of the area where the handle is, I can’t see the baby unless I get on the side or stand on my tiptoes.  Also with the baby there, the sun shade covers up the cup holder unless I put it over him.For the toddler seat in the front, the cup holder section doesn’t easily unlatch on one side to flip over for him to get out.  Have to lift him in and out over the cup holder/snack area.For such a big stroller it is easy to maneuver.

  I love this stroller! Perfect for twins! Makes doctors appointments and outings so much easier to just click the car seats in and my two year old can sit in the stroller while the babies are being assessed. Folds up nicely, about the size of a single stroller. Good steering and storage. We haven’t upgraded vehicles yet so we store it in the passenger seat of our Mazda 5 mini-mini van and it fits nicely.

  They must have updated the manual because loading the car seat into the stroller was mentioned in the manual (unlike previous comments/reviews). The undercarriage basket is quite large but it is difficult to access when the back rider is reclined however my toddler usually doesn't fall asleep in the stroller these days so I haven't had an issue. I was amazed by how smooth the ride was and how easily I was able to maneuver the stroller in small spaces. My toddler loves that she can see her baby sister (see photo) during the ride :) Plus you can't beat the price! I have only loaded it once in my car and it is fairly light but my mother wouldn't be able to lift it in.

  I researched double strollers for weeks before deciding on this one (based on description & reviews). I have only tested it out with my toddler (to be sure I like the push/stroll, open/close mechanisms...as our new baby hasn't arrived yet).It was easy to assemble, pushes very smoothly, has a great space for adult cup/few small items & big under carriage.The only thing I wish was a little easier was the closing mechanism - you kind of have to “slam” the stroller together to get the plastic latch to lock. Not a deal breaker but will be a little frustrating at times; I’m sure.

  Love that there are so many different ways for my kids to sit and it’s easy to use. Folding is a little frustrating because you have to take off the trays in both seats - but that is just a convenience thing because removal is still very easy. I also wish there was a bit more leg room in the back seat - my toddler’s shoes always get stuck when I try to pull her out but the baby in the car seat is still up front.

  I have to say that this is a really good stroller and we're glad to get this kind instead of the side-by-side seat. This stroller looks complicated but unbelievably easy to use. 1 step to unlock and 2 steps to fold it back. Both seats are reclinable and has a very spacious storage underneath.

",3.0 ,Billy and Shanna,"Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  First off, the instructions that come along with the stroller are terrible. I had to Google how to open the stroller, how to install the click connect car seat and how to fold up the stroller as the directions we're not clear whatsoever. With that said, there is an actual latch that you have to unhook on the left side of the stroller to unfold rather than the handle bar twist-switch, whereas my single Graco stroller would unfold using the handlebar switch. Then to fold it back up, you use the handlebar switch and have to squish the stroller together as hard as you can to get it to latch closed (again, my single stroller is a simple turn of the handlebar switch, push forward and done). Poor design and not convenient for a mom of 2 small children. The stroller does move around well, but bigger in length than I thought it would be. Another downfall is there are no shoulder straps, only waist straps, in the seats. For $130, I had much higher expectations for this stroller. It will do for the time being but im sure I'll be annoyed each time I have to fold and unfold it.

  It works well enough for the price. There are a few flaws such as the difficulty we have getting it to close all the way. There is no way to collapse the bottom basket, making it hard to get stuff out, especially with the top seat in the laying position. It could also use shoulder straps to keep the child in place. Other than that really, it's not half bad.

  Had this for 4 months and it is already falling apart. Although it has a great sized basket you can’t access it while there is a kid in it. The back only reclines when you have both hands free to pull the tabs. It’s qll the way back or sitting up. It only has a 3 pt seatbelt which is horrible when you have a kid who can’t sit up well. If you use the car seat in the back it’s hard to get the kid out because the handlebar area takes up space and can’t move. The front seat doesn’t recline  and it’s big and bulky. Have to disassemble the front tray and shade to fit into my Jeep trunk. It does handle and maneuver well but gets caught on uneven pavement. The stroller is in such disrepair after 4 months I need a new stroller.

  Amazon sent me this stroller that DOES NOT CLOSE. IT DOES NOT WORK. As a single mom of one with one due in May I need a stroller that does what it’s supposed to. It’s broken. It was also sent in a box that was NOT taped shut or securely shut so it also had a tear in the fabric. Graco PROMISED a replacement. But then backtracked. Beware of Graco.I'm so sorry that your new double stroller may not have the ease of use features that you were hoping for, and for the frustrations this has caused! As a mom, I know how challenging traveling with a toddler can be, especially while pregnant or with a newborn. I also understand how stressful everyone's lives are right now with Covid-19. 💙 Unfortunately, since double strollers are larger, longer, and heavier, they aren't going to be quite as easy to fold and carry as a single stroller.

  Sturdy, comfortable, and safe tandem stroller.  Canopies and trays give shade and panel for kid's busy hands, snacks and beverage bottle.  Designed for easy assemble.  All parts fit and snap lock.  The seatbelt lock buckles are too small and too hard to press release.  Child safe overplay turns into nuisance ergonomics.  Back rests drop down for sleeping.  Trays lift out to clean or stow, but the underside finger release is not marked, some thing that will break if forcing tray out.  The rear wheel locks to park are toe kicked from front.

  Overall, I like this stroller. Since its it's a double stroller, I expected it to be bigger, heavier, longer than my single one.  That being said, it maneuvers very well, and collapses and is put up pretty easily.  I wanted one that both children can face forward, and fit my Graco carseat. It has a very large basket underneath, which is nice!However, there are a few improvements that could be made, that I liked on the single stroller.  The piece that locks the stroller when folded is hard to find and pretty flimsy. I expect it not to last. Also, there is no flap at the top to see the child. You have to bend down to look in the clear plastic,or just look around the cover. There is only 1 adult cupholder, instead of two. I also liked the cell phone stand instead of a compartment that can close.

  Pretty happy with this.  We already had a few graco products, including a click connect car seat and single stroller base.  Got this for our 2 year old and 2 month old.  It's worked really well, I think this is one of the best values out there for a double stroller if you're not going to pay $500+ for one of the fancy brands.  It's pretty easy to maneuver, fits in smallish elevators ok.One of the big bonuses of this one is that it fits in the trunk of our 2015 Honda fit.  You do have to take off the front cupholder/tray, and the canopy, but that's really fast and easy.  This is also on the lighter side of the double strollers we saw.  It folds very easily, legitimately one-handed.  Getting it unlocked to unfold is a bit tricker, the latch to release it is a bit of a pain, but you get used to it.As other reviewers have mentioned, access to the underseat storage is limited if the back seat is laid down, and you have to do that if you put a carseat in the rear position, but you can work around that.  We're going to try and fly with it, using it as gate-check, it seems small and light enough that the airlines will let us do it.  I'd definitely buy again.

  I researched for a long, long time, many reviews and specs and finally got down to Contours Options Elite Tandem Double Stroller and the Graco DuoGlider. DuoGlider will accommodate the Click Connect car seat that will now be used for my new grandchild. Contours needs an adapter purchased. DuoGlider has trays for each seat. Contours would need them purchased. DuoGlider is about half the price of Contours.Bought the DuoGlider. Pretty easy setup. Instructions could be better. Car Seat fits well. Rides a little bumpy but my 2-year old grandchild likes how that ""tickles his tummy"".Problems: When 2-year-old is in back and baby is in carseat up front so they can face each other, it is really really difficult to get him out of the seat. The seat in front has to fully recline to accommodate the carseat and doesn't leave much room for his feet when you are trying to pull him out.The storage bin is only accessible if the car seat is in the front. If I move it to the back, the storage bin is inaccessible except a small space to stick your hand in on the sides. Not useful.There are only lap belts, which really delays when I can stop using the car seat for the baby. Our single Graco Click Connect Stroller had 5-point harness and it's great. Not sure why they were taken out with this model.Final Analysis: I've only used it once but so far I'm wishing I spent the extra money for the Contours.

  I think this would be best for those with twins or babies that are still in the infant seat at the same time. My toddler and infant were able to ride this, but it’s super bulky and long and hard to maneuver. I ended up selling it locally after only a couple uses.

  This product when used with the carseat that goes with it is great. It moves with ease, has all the room you would need and my kids already love it. The back part that lays down is big enough to fit my two older kids if they get tired of walking. It is truly a great stroller.

  Best stroller!  We have a newborn and a 2 year old and it works perfect for both of them. Love the bassinet option in the back seat for the baby and the 2 year old likes sitting up front. Easy to fold and unfold, it's a bit heavy but that's expected for as big as it is so it's worth it!

  I love and hate this stroller. What I love: It’s easy for me to push around on walks or to go shopping. I am 6’ and the handle is tall enough where I don’t have to to hunch over. It’s fits in my Kia compact car trunk and still fit other small things.What I hate about it- the front right wheel wobbles which makes me nervous that it’ll fall off one day and second it’s a pain the butt to collapse. In order for it to close and latch you have to take off the front tray and the front shade and then you have to reattach the items after you collapse it and then to open it you have to take the items off before pulling on the the latch. I travel with my kids once to twice a month and it’s a pain to fly with I dread collapsing it in the jet bridge because it’s a freaking long process.

You literally have to cram things in the sides.It is easy to open and maneuver and I like the front and back vs side by side.

Our reflux twin B can’t really be flat for too long.Sun shade could cover more.. still need hats and a swaddle cover on topCONs: when both car seats are in or rear seat is used for car seat or is all the way reclined,  no access to your under storage, nearly impossible.

  I bought this stroller so I could go walking for exercise with my two kids. I have a 6 month old and a 3 year old. I thought it was ok at first until I realized the stroller pulls to the left like a bad cart at Walmart and we all know how annoying that is. It put a lot of stain on my left arm because of this causing it to be sore while trying to keep it straight. You also can't adjust the back seat and I don't like that. Overall it just wasn't comfortable for what I was trying to do. If you're looking for a double stroller to go on long walks, this isn't it!!

  I really like this stroller. The ride is smooth for my son and he was able to sit in it at 4 months with a little extra support from blankets. I like that the back seat fully reclines. We use it for walks with his cousin who is one month older. The basket in the bottom is huge. I did not like that it did not fit into the trunk of my elantra. I think we could if we took off the canopies but that seems like a hassle for everyday use. It does fit into the trunk of our corolla.

",3.0 ,Evan Schrock,"Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2019","









  
  
    
  We bought this for a recent trip to Disney and it was a nightmare transporting it on the shuttles. It was advertised as one handed folding but that could not be farther from the truth. Every time we had to fold it to get on a shuttle I had to literally sit on it. There is a small black plastic tab that is supposed to catch a latch when it shuts but it is so badly offline that you have to force it sideways at least a quarter of an inch for it to grab. If it does grab and catch you had about a 50/50 shot of it popping back open as you were carrying it one handed onto the shuttle. This is our third stroller and second double stroller and by far the worst design of them. Not sure if I'll try to return to Amazon or sell locally but this was a big disappointment. Still giving it 3 stars because once you got it open and ready to go it pushes easily and has tons of storage (why we bought it) but it's not worth the fight every time you need to load it in or out of a vehicle

    The ideal double stroller for us
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Lindsay Penvose,2017年4月6日 在美国审核,"









  
  
    
  After a fairly in depth search, ordered this stroller and am quite happy with it. So far it's ideal for my two girls - newborn and 2.5 year old. What I like the most is how well it suits kids with this age difference - it has a few full seat options for my older daughter (some double strollers have a small bench or standing option only which would be great, if the older child was maybe 4-5 vs 2-3).Here are some pics of the two configurations we've used so far.It's also fairly lightweight as double strollers go and easy to push. It folds flat if you remove some of the trays/canopies and fits easily into the back of my SUV - a Jeep Compass - which is not overly large.

  Fits the trunk of a Honda Fit if you remove the front tray and canopy.Edit: After months using it I can review it better.- Pros.The build is sturdy enough, and the back seat is great for older children to sleep because it reclines so much almost horizontally.- Cons: It is really heavy to lift, and long to make turns or stroll in corridors or elevators. Folding it fully closed until it locks is quite complicated*. When the back seat rest is fully reclined the under basket is blocked, to access it one must use the side openings which are smaller.Overall I still rate it 5 stars because having 2 children in a single stroller sleeping at the same time is a blessing.* FIY: turn the front wheels so that they facing backwards, adjust the front seat back rest down, twist the grip and step on the basket until it folds, and make sure that everything is OK by checking on the left that lock is in place. Phew!

  I'm so excited for this new double Graco! We have 3 children, with one more on the way, and I needed a stroller that would allow for my 21 month old to ride, as well as hold the new baby while in her Graco car seat. We already have the Graco Ready2Grow Classic Connect Double, but learned with our last baby that this particular style was discontinued (in 2014, a month after we purchased it) and it is not compatible with the newest car seats, which are now ""Click Connect"", NOT ""Classic Connect"". Minor differences between the two, so it's frustrating to have to get new gear, but also gives me an excuse to get new things for the new baby! I'm sharing all this background info because it took a lot of onlins research for me to figure out why our car seat would not fit our stroller.The Graco DuoGlider is similar to the newest Ready2Grow Click Connect Double, but does not allow for all the extra ways for an older child to sit and stand. Since we already have the old ready2grow double, that's not a problem. My main concern was would a car seat fit in one of the seats? And, yes! It sure does. It can fit in either the front or the back, allowing another child (or car seat) to sit in the other. It's lighter weight than any other doubles I've used, easy to put together, easy to push and turn corners, and the kids love it. So I love it! It also has a very large storage compartment underneath & a nice quality adult cup holder. I highly recommend this stroller!

  I purchased two of these strollers because I have 5 month old triplets and a toddler. It is really versatile because there are so many different positions you can use it in. I love that you can snap the infant car seats in as well as use the seats. The back seat fully reclines which is amazing. You need two hands to recline the back seat though which is annoying. There are latches in both sides that you have to release at the same time. Not well thought out. It truly is a one hanred fold. Opening is not as easy yet because we have yet to figure out how to unlock it. We've only used these strollers 3 times as you can imagine how difficult it is to pull together 3 newborns and a toddler.... which brings me to my next point. The frame of the front seat on one of the strollers has completely snapped off!!! This happened after using it only 3 times. I don't know if this is a quality issue or if we received a defective product.I love the design but now can't use the front seat to hold a car seat after only 3 uses. Huge bummer. Would be a 5 star product if it didn't break so soon.Edit: customer service replaced the stroller super fast and both strollers are working smoothly

  I love this stroller! It fits my kiddos comfortably with room to grow. I like that if the toddler is in the back, he can still see over the baby in the front. I looooove that the back seat goes flat for easy napping on the go. The cargo area underneath is huge and fits so much. You can’t access it from the back when the back seat is down but you can absolutely access it from the middle between the seats easily. I have used a jogging stroller with my first child and this stroller surprisingly handles well on rough terrain. Not like a jogger, but definitely no complaints from me. We’ve taken it in the woods, on gravel, and in sand. Not ideal but works fine! I love that each child has a canopy and food/drink tray. This stroller glides easily and is so easy to push/steer, even one handed. It opens and closes very easily one handed. It was super simple to put together. Everyone complaining this is bulky and heavy have never seen another double stroller obviously. They’re all big, bulky, and heavy to some degree! This stroller takes up less space and weighs significantly less than the single stroller we had for our first. I folded this up and lifted this double stroller one handed into the back of my pick up truck bed 1.5 weeks after having a csection. It’s really not that heavy or awkward at all. Not to mention, you cannot best the price. If I had to have one complaint, I’d like the parent console to be better. I’d like 2 cup holders up top, as hubby and I like to make evening coffees for our walks, and the container for keys/cell phone is a little small for smart phones. BUT I have an iPhone 6s Plus in a bulky otter box, so it’s huge and probably just my phone! Highly highly recommend!

  So I Love the stroller!! I found myself in a stuck situation where my double stroller went missing. With a new born and a toddle  I was in need of a new one fast. Even though my car seat is baby trend this stroller is able to accommodate to any car seat. It was really easy to put together. It's really smooth when strolling it around. Love the fact the cup holders can come off and are easy to put back on. The only thing I did not like was the opening of the stroller. What I mean by this is the latch. You have to pull really hard to unlatch the stroller. But I would recommend this stroller to anyone with multiple children.

  It is almost the perfect stroller. I love this because it is so versitle if you have a newborn and a toddler. I sit my 17 month old in the back and then my two month in the front seat so they are facing wchtoher and my 17 month just loves it! She will rattle toys for her brother out on walks it is amazing. The big basket underneath is perfect for holding the diaper bag with room to spare. Some might. Not like that when you pull the back seat to the laying position that you cannot access the basket very well, but it does not bother me. The downsides to the stroller are the cup holder. It is too shallow. Any bump you hit little or big the cup of water bottle flys out of the stroller. I also not a fan that you cannot have anything left over in your stroller basket when you go to close it up. I had a sweater in the basket and the stroller would not lock when I was trying to fold it. Overall I would reccomend this strollerOver the double strollers out there that are side by side. It does fold up to a good size. I can still fit it in my trunk of a Ford Escape and still get some grocerys in the back as well.

  I debated for a long time over which double stroller to get. My youngest two kids will be 21 months apart when the new baby is born, but my toddler hates sitting in his stroller. I thought about a sit n stand, but I really wanted two seats so both kids could fall asleep of we're out for a while. I picked Graco because I can also snap in my infant seat.The new baby isn't here yet but I use this stroller a few times a week with my toddler and neice when I'm watching her. They are both 16 months old now and they easily fall asleep in this stroller on walks. It also makes getting into the library, etc so much easier than pushing one in a stroller and carrying the other toddler while managing the bigger kids walking.I also needed a stroller that would fit with some other things in my Traverse trunk which isn't too deep when the third row is up. Although I can't keep the front tray or canopy on to get it in the trunk,I just leave those in there in case I need them as they clip right back on. I can fit this stroller, some blankets, a portable baby gate, an umbrella stroller and a golf umbrella in my trunk with some room to spare.I didn't want a side by side as my little guy has trouble keeping his hands to himself. With this stroller, he sits in the front so he can't poke or pull the other rider :)For the price this can't be beat, I'm so glad I purchased it!

  We owned one of these second hand since my eldest daughter was very young and we loved it. Ours began to break down more and more and we were happy to purchase the newer version of it a second time, but we would be the first owners. It isn't nearly as nice as the one it replaced!It's a damn NIGHTMARE to fold up now. The cheaper materials they are using now do not lien up as nicely and instead force you to bear hug the thing to fold it up, and that is only if the wheels are rotated within the 10 degrees that allow it to actually fold up. If they rotate away, as they are literally designed to do, you are squeezing it like a madman for nothing.It also refuses to close if the front seat has the shade in place, and if you manipulate the shade to close the stroller then it is blocking entry into the stroller when it's reopened and has to be adjusted completely back into place.I think they need to retire the Strollers by Helen Keller line up.
