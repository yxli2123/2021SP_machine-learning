  I have ordered 6 boxes from modenna and have received diffrent packaging that are not in a box or say modenna, I've returned those because they are diffrent quality the nose strip does not bend easily like the ones that come in a box that says modenna. I'm very frustrated and confused why this happens if I'm ordering from the same company ""modenna disposable masks"" and the price also keeps changing.

  I ordered several different mask types from Amazon.  Although I'm sure these are fine for whatever setting they were originally made for, I don't exactly feel safe with these on when I'm out.  There is way to much air that escape and way too much air I feel coming in on the sides.  I suppose it is better than nothing but I've opted for more secure masks.

    Claim that not shipped from China misleading
  
",3.0,Barbara Holman,"Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  The product seems fine for the purpose. I specifically chose this vendor to order from because of the statement that it was not shipped from China. I look at the product's box... Made in China. Grammar translation on sides of box is poor. Will use the masks because they are hard to obtain, but disappointed in misleading information. If you are looking for a MADE IN USA product, this is not it.

  This are nowhere near the comfort and quality of those blue doctor looking masks. I found these black masks to be very uncomfortable on my face and flimsy. I had to adjust it several times while in store. The material is also super light weight, and frankly wont block much.I also just noticed the name of this company. Not sure if they are trying to get people to think they are Moderna. Anyway, not happy with this purchase. I will be donating these since they were headed for the GARBAGE.

    Doesn't  work: Only looks like the ones that work
  
",1.0,John of Maine,"Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  These mask ONLY looks exactly like the ones that are given to folks walking in for routine treatment at Mass. General Hospital but they do not perform anything like the Mass. General masks.  That is, one cannot compress the nose piece on this mask to conform to ones nose to create a seal - it just bounces back to its original shape.  When I inhale with this mask, the mask itself does not compress like identical looking ones, which indicates that air is entering through the mask fabric instead from around it.  Exhaling is the same, i.e., the air from my breath goes around the mask in contrast to the ones the hospital provides me when I go for routine treatment.  I regret buying this product.

  I ordered these in May and I imagine there was a rush to get masks into production, but they were both excessively expensive (how do you spell ""price gauging""?) and had an extremely high rate of breakage.  I'd say one of four either already had a broken elastic ear strap or it broke as soon as it was pulled.  Such poor quality and expense taints this company permanently.

  We’ve had a quality issue where the ear loop pulls out with minor pressure.

",1.0,L MacDonald,"Reviewed in the United States February 6, 2021","









  
  
    
  I bought these to start double-masking as I'm high risk.  I wore one under one of my cloth masks when going to a doctor's appointment and didn'trealize how awful they were until the staff wouldn't let me in for my appointment unless I used one of theirs. When I got home I realized these measured 1-1/2 inches wider than the medical masks making them useless.The pleats weren't able to expand and conform to your face. I tried adding an extra pleat, tying elastic ends, etc.  Air escapes from ALL sides.

",3.0,Peng,"Reviewed in the United States August 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  I only use these for doing low risk activities, like walking outside. Two masks had straps broken at the attachment point, but I also have a big face and I was hanging them below the chin, pulling them up when I see people coming. So maybe that stretch contributed. I've been more careful taking them on/off after those two incidences and it has been ok. So I would suggest carrying an extra mask just in case this one breaks and don't pull on the straps too hard.

  I bought this for myself to wear at work. First of all, I didn’t notice any chemical smell from the mask. I can wear it all day without feeling suffocated or skin irritation. The elastic band is sturdy and glue tightly to the mask. It is 3 ply mask as it claimed. I have found the mask is a little big for my face, not fitting properly. However, when I use the ear saver in the back of my head, the mask fits nicely to my face and does not leave any marks on my face. I will buy more when I use all of this box. I have sensitive skin and so far I have used it everyday without any problems with my skin. I would recommend this mask for daily use.

  I am a physician and have used face masks for many years. These masks are sub-standard. The nosepiece is not made out of metal and is ineffective at making even a loose seal around one’s nose.  The masks slip off of one’s nose easily, don’t block respiratory droplets well and fog up glasses. I would not recommend these.

",3.0,Merri,"Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2021","









  
  
    
  False advertising. It is not one size fits all, unless everyone is an XXL. You can use clips to adjust the make to make it ad snug as can be but it still isn't a perfect fit. I bought these for the convenience of grabbing on the go. To sit down with each individual one to adjust with my own non disposable clips, only to dispose of the mask and remove the clips, is a huge inconvenience. This isn't the first 'one size fits all' package I have bought that is clearly meant for giants. If you have a large nose/face then these will be perfect for you.One thing I do like is the quality and feel, which is why I am giving 3 stars.

    Multiple gaps and loose fit
  
",1.0,Binny,"Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  I thought all these masks were pretty much the same.  I was wrong. There are open gaps all around this mask that allows free air flow.  No matter how much you adjust you get gaps along the sides and nose.  Also, the fit is very loose because there is too much slack in the ear loops.  But that’s not the main problem because even if you tie off the loops to make it not loose, you still have the gaps.  If you want COVID protection or want to not spread to others, don’t get this mask.

  If you are desperate for a made in China mask this will probably do.  I have tried many masks over the years and this one is one of the worst.  It does not hug the face well leaving gaps.  Nose bridge metal piece does not bend easily and retain bent form again leaving gaps.  At over 50 cents/mask this feels to me like price gouging in a difficult time.

  Now that the mask is must have, I think this is the best mask I bought for the price. Although I'm happy buying it but there still some disadvantages and I think same with other mask. The rubber band are easy to get detached so I'm always bringing extra one of these which kind a hassle. This is less thicker than other you can buy but more comfortable since can wrap your face easily.

No broken elastic but they're only forty cents a piece (IOW - disposable), I wouldn't be surprised if some of them broke off.- they are not intended to be sterile, so expecting that is a little unreasonable.- I got the brand as advertised.- the box had a mfg. date, lot number, and expiration date printed on it.

However, upon use I was soon disappointed. I put three new masks  in a plastic storage bag to have handy when I needed to go to the grocery. I took two into the store with me. When I attempted to put on the first one inside the store, the top left string just came off.  I took out the other one and it too had a bad unattached string. I ended up having to tie the broken string onto the top of the mask. It was the only thing I could attempt to do at that time. I'm sure it looked pretty chintzy, but I had to have on a mask. Very disappointed and now I have 50 of them. I checked the box of them when I got back home. There were several masks with the strings just unattached. Others will probably come off upon attempting to wear. Very disappointed especially since face masks are becoming the norm at this time. Will need to check a different supplier hopefully with better results.

    Medical Grade Thick Durable
  
",5.0,Nicole,"Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  Wow totally impressed.  Was expecting a lesser quality due to the other reviews but I think the manufacturer has improved the thickness of the product in the last few months. These have to be medical grade because they appear to be the same thing as what I got from Dr. They also seem to be thicker than other masks I had. I had masks the doctors office and the feel of the fabric along with the smell of the mask is identical. The smell of a mask really is key to its quality. It has the same smell as the masks I got from my Dr. The color was typical blue and white. The elastic bands looked identical in attachment to the mask. The top has the wire ridge that allows you to conform it to your nose. It also is layered so you can spread it open across your nose and mouth. Just as the photo. They arrived in a plastic bag inside a box that was taped shut. To be extra cautious I put the whole bag on the dashboard of my car to let the sun and heat kill off anything. But that was my own choice. Nothing about the masks made me think I had to take this extra step. I've been wearing them in closed environments from grocery to errands. No issues.

  I was very disappointed that the elastic attaching the mask on the first several masks I took out was detached, making it unusable.  For the masks where the elastic was initially attached, most of them had at least one elastic detach upon putting it on making it unusable.  I was very sorry I ordered them - a complete waste.

Others are higher $26 or more ,and yet Im sure theyre all the same quality. Masks came in a bundle of 50s  in a clear plastic pack and in a mask box. Box came clean , not dented, mask came clean, no stains, ear loops were intact. Tried one of them, smell is like any other mask from manufacturer, a little chemical smell which is probably from the material used and color dye of the mask but otherwise not harmful to the lungs. I dont think this mask is 3 layered, its a little thin compared to medical grade you buy from medical supply or CVS Pharmacy which is a little thicker. If youre sensitive to the smell in the mask, air the masks first for 1 -2 days. Im ok w/ this purchase. Whats impt is that you have a face covering and to prevent you from touching your eyes, nose, mouth w/c can be portals of entry of Any virus, not just Covid 19.These masks are sold by MODENA and fulfilled by Amazon.

  In this COVID-19 era, there's a lot of masks out there. I used cloth masks primarily, and one day had to visit a hospital to do some consulting work. I was given a mask like this as that was the only mask they allowed in for visitors (no gaiters, no cloth masks, etc), and I realized instantly how comfortable this style is on your ears, and how much easier it is to breath in 90 degree weather. And you can buy this style mask almost anywhere these days. But for me, I was happy to grab them off Amazon for ten bucks less than any comparable retail price for a box of 50.In an unprecedented time, where we all must do our part to keep our neighbors safe, these masks make thing a little more comfortable. This review can probably apply to 100 other Amazon listings, as I'm pretty sure these masks come out of the same factory as most of the other similarly priced ones, and just have a different logo on the box. So honestly, buy the cheap ones. When I purchased, that was Modenna.

  Several of our family members (particularly those that wear glasses) prefer the disposable masks to cloth reusable masks.  These are no exception.  The only complaint is that they are slightly less tall than similar masks we have received in healthcare facilities so they don't sit as far under the chin.  Though the nose wire is thinner than some other masks we have found them to work perfectly and hold form around the bridge of the nose well.  I think we will look for a brand next time that is a little bigger, but these are more than adequate and have an exceptional price.

  I have had several different paper masks and have not had a problem with any of them.  These are large, even when twisting the elastic.  The corners dig into your face and the paper is really stiff, making it not fit well at all.  I wore one for about 20 minutes and all I did was adjust it, trying to bend the corners over so it stops digging into my face.  My face still hurts 30 min later.

  We bought 3 different brands of 3-layer disposable face masks, and this particular brand, Modenna Face Mask, was the THINNEST.It is definitely a ONE-ply mask (false advertising/description).This mask feels like it was very cheaply made, with low quality materials.With the other two brands, you can feel the different layers between your fingers;  this brand “Modenna Face Mask” is NOT 3-layers. You can see through this mask and you cannot feel any more than one layer.The ear loops are thinner than a small rubber band and was very flimsy. The front/back of the mask is indistinguishable; and again, you can see through the mask.There is also a very petrol/chemical smell to the mask (but when we opened the sealed box and let the masks air-out for about an hour, the smell did dissipate and was not as strong).We are very disappointed with this purchase and wish we could get our refund.  This brand, “Modenna Face Mask” is a waste of money.

Kinda disappointed, as these I’ll need to double up so I’ll go through twice as fast :-(. I Also noticed on the box that it says non surgical Grade which isn’t what I was looking for. Lesson learned.  These are also pretty big, so I need to tie smaller loops for the ear loops, for a tighter fit.

  I'm no doctor or scientist, but I didn't find anything wrong with this product (besides a little upset that this was double the price when I purchased it, compared to now, ha...). I didn't do any hard core testing like ripping it apart and test each layer, etc, but the mask layers feel pretty ""sturdy"" to me. My father did put water on it just to see if it would absorb/seep through, and it didn't. So I guess it should be able to block big droplets of saliva if any should be coming at us, or prevent them from going out.. I hope.... There is a little paper slip in Chinese that came with it which stated that the product passed inspection and the materials used, etc etc. (I know some of you don't trust anything made in China, but really, there are recalls on stuff made here and elsewhere, too. If you are going to be distrustful then it might as well be with everything. Can't trust labels, social media, etc etc).Anyway, a couple of the masks did have fallen ear loop bands, but it was ok for me as I have a cloth mask which allows me to insert the mask in. So for the couple that had fallen bands, I just did that. An easy fix could be to staple the bands on the mask though, like some people already pointed out. It should hold. Stay safe!

  The masks are exactly as they appear. They are good quality and have a really good fit around the face and nose. There's a little brace over the nose bridge you can shape for a better fit. It's like a wire but I'm not sure it's actual metal. The loops fit comfortably behind the ears so there's no danger of rash if you wear it for a long time.As with so many other people, I was unable to find any masks here in the US. I was glad to find this listing for Modenna masks when I did. They shipped super fast, and came way quicker than anticipated.I was quite relieved to get them, as they are quality masks, made from solid materials. They are not flimsy, and have a sturdy nose pinch piece. I'm in and out of hospitals and medical facilities all day as an essential employee, as well as for my own medical needs. Being protected was super important to me, and these masks help me be protected!Masks with the ear loops like this are nice because they don't restrict movement of your head. I've worn these a few times now and after a few minutes I forget I'm even wearing them.

  Disappointed! This mask has two deficiencies, compared to masks I was using: (1) The baffles are cut too close, so the mask does not expand too much over the nose, mouth and chin, resulting in it feeling tight and uncomfortable against the nose. (2) The all-important wire to conform the mask to the nose is extremely weak. I can also say that the fabric is not as soft as what I had, but for me this is not so important. Hopefully you can understand the problem from the photos and learn how to look for something better.

    Bad nose piece design
  
",3.0,Aaron S.,"Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  These masks are decent, however, the wire inside the nose bridge is very thin compared to other face masks of this type I've purchased before.  This leads to a very loose fit around the nose and the exhaled air just blows upwards out of the mask, which is especially annoying if you're wearing glasses.  If the wire was more firm like other masks then you could mold it around your nose for a better fit.

  These masks are basic and probably do the job they are designed to do. they are conveniently packaged, five packs of 10 and each pack is resealable. This is convenient and hygienic. but the material is coarse and the part that should be secured around the nose bridge is rough, scratchy and uncomfortable.

    ICU Nurse's review of the Modenna blue medical face masks
  
",4.0,Lilly,"Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2021","









  
  
    
  The goal of using a mask in a box of masks is to remove the top mask with one quick smooth grasp that does NOT disturb or contaminate the masks below in the stack. It's likely the most elementary part of putting a paper medical mask on.However, the addition of a large heat sealed bag is cheap and it COULD have been put on the outside of the box of masks for easy and permanent removal. But, this is a China- made box of masks.There's virtually no way the folded paper part or the elastic ear loops can be improperly fitting. They are, as far as I can see, One Size Fits All.  There is a very small metal nose contour piece and the pleats in the mask easily allow the mask to be pulled down from the bridge of the nose to underneath the chin securely.I was able to remove the plastic bag from my huge pile of masks in the box, but that's not the way masks should be handled, regardless of use.Above all, please buy PPE and wear a mask until we are said to not need them by official health sources. These fit the bill, they just have one inconvenience.The price is very low and good.One last thing, I wouldn't know I wasn't using hospital medical grade masks if I hadn't bought them myself for home use and know the provenance is not the pre- pandemic supply chain for US hospitals.  This means they seem to be good paper masks. I wear mine UNDER a fabric mask. Double masking is over 90% effective in stopping the spread of the novel coronavirus at the date of this review ( 1-18-21).  Best of health to each of you.

  I wanted a color other than black (and pink seemed interesting), from a reputable brand. This product came up (I think on page 1) when I searched pink face masks. Great reviews, and a lot of them, gave me enough reason to purchase. For masks, they are very comfortable, and stretch no problem. The bendable light metal nose strip (on the interior lining of the mask) conforms easily to the bridge of the nose. These masks pass the “can’t blow out the flame” test, so I am happy about that, too.I wear these to work in my classroom each day, and so far so good. I love the color and the feel of them on, is very light, so I am not bothered by it. It doesn’t seem to irritate my face, nor lead to acne thus far, which is also a plus.

The box is professionally decorated with all certifications and clearly states these are disposable grade.  The mfg and expiration date are listed on the bottom.  When you open the box the masks are sealed together inside a thick mil plastic bag to prevent contamination during warehouse or shipping to our home.  We have used over 30 so far with the curbside pickup and have not had a mask elastic break or pull off of the side of the mask.  We are going to order more for the month the May while our state distancing and mask requirements remain in effect.

  These arrived quickly,  just 3 or 4 days.  I paid 34 dollars before tax and I see now they are 24 dollars for a 50 count box.  The inside plastic bag is sealed with an adhesive flap.  I would be more comfortable with a sealed plastic bag that needs to be torn open.  The masks I received do seem brand new.  They look just like the picture.  They  fit my adult male semi large head a bit snug but acceptable.  The elastic straps do seem a bit dodgy.  I haven't had a strap break yet but I carry an extra mask in my pocket just in case.  I think a scarf/bandana is a more secure option and obviously cheaper.  I'm not going to return this type of product after I've already opened the package and used a couple of the masks, but if I could go back I might pass on the purchase.

  The ear loops did not stay attached. There was a Foul odor that seemed to be present in every single mask. One might think it was their own breath after lunch but even the masks that were still in the box and had been on worn or untouched for that matter still had this strange odor. Given the current predicament we are in with having to wear facemasks in public, a reliable product would’ve been great instead of having to deal with the hassle of returning something that was not functional. I purchased these masks as a back up to the fabric masks my children and I wear every day unfortunately these did not hold up.

  This is not a medical grade mask, which are hard to find now for non medical personnel. It is the same width as other masks I have had, but when opened, probably an inch to inch and a half shorter. From my perspective it fits tighter across the face, probably because it doesn't go as far beneath the chin. For example, the masks we were given during a hospital visit extend down to the adams apple, this stops about an inch or so above, still adequate to cover you nose, mouth and chin. I've tugged pretty firmly on several from the box and haven't had any strings separate from the mask.
