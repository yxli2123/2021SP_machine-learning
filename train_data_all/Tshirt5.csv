    Too small and shrinks terribly
  
",2.0,Tallenoahu,"Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2021","









  
  
    
  Bought these shirts for my husband and son.  On initial try on they were a little shorter than they like but could handle it for the price.  After first washing the shirts exposed belly buttons!  They are also not the greatest cotton and are a bit scratchy.  Will not be purcshasing again....

  Arrived on time. Nice T-shirt material. Washed well. Fits the way I like; not slim fit. I like that the bands at the wrist don't stretch out & get loose when I pull them up my arm. Bottom of shirt falls below my butt & that's what I wanted. Also, bought these in gray. I'll be buying more. Definitely recommend.

    Good quality, sized correctly, and fits to a 'long sleeve T'
  
",4.0,Sonicmoon,"Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2021","









  
  
    
  The quality of the material is very good and thicker than most thin t-shirts.  It's sized correctly - I'm 6' 185 lbs with a 42"" chest and a 32"" waist - the shoulder seams are appropriate, the chest area fits well, and the waist isn't too baggy or tight.  We'll see how that remains after the first and second washing.  The color is a nice blue, as well.  Overall I'm very pleased with a quality, good deal.

  It should have been made without 1""+ tags that could stick up past the collar,dressing in a hurry. Who wants the fashion police tucking in a tag, let alone that it's so uncomfy? A simple loop to serve the end-user rather than a useless tag, in order to be made to hang on a clothesline without leaving those brown dimples from the clothespins. Add your logo to the loop. I cut off all your tags about 10 seconds after opening the package anyways. All that's left are black remnants of where your tag once was so why not rethink this waste time on everyone part and be the trend setter? I'm giving you the most innovative solution for the 21rst century, free of charge!! Why look like a Nutty Professor if you don't need to? That's my job!Sincerely,The Nutty Professor

  This is one of those, you get what you pay for situations it seems. The material and thickness of the shirt feels stiff and cheap. The sewing at the cuff is very rough looking and uneven. I will keep them, but it will be more of an around the house type shirt instead of a long sleeve t-shirt to throw on to go run errands or hang out with people.

  The shirts are very good, but I caution anyone who is not ‚Äúmodel slim‚Äù to buy at least one-size larger than usual. They shrink after washing, which is fine, perhaps I missed it in the description. But, if you read reviews slower/closer than descriptions, hopefully this helps.

    Harsh and rough as cardboard
  
",1.0,Maria Adams,"Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2021","









  
  
    
  I have always liked Gildan T-shirts, so I purchased these long sleeved tshirts to enjoy during the winter. I bought 3 two-piece sets, only to find out they were extremely harsh. So I washed them and added fabric softener hoping this would make them feel better. I repeated the process twice, but the t-shirts NEVER turned soft. They are as harsh and rough as cardboard. Returning them is not an option at this point, after multiple washes. So all I can write a review to let others know what they can expect. I definitely do not recommend these t-shirts at all.

    The scratchiest piece of clothing ever created
  
",1.0,Ryan Guillory,"Reviewed in the United States December 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  Bought as undershirts to wear at work. Didn't want to spend a ton on thermals because I live in a desert where it gets cold but nothing unbearable. I've been wearing these for a few weeks and it seems no matter how much fabric softener I soak these in, they come out unbearably scratchy. I got an armpit rash from one of these this week so finally bit the bullet and went to target to buy regular long sleeves for 3x the price. Also for some reason the stiching around the cuffs of the sleeves are super tight and need to be stretched every time you wear them.

  When I ordered these, it only came with one shirt; I acknowledge I am partially to blame for my predicament because I could have complained when I received it, but procrastinated until I forgot.I have no complaints about the quality of the shirt, as many of the other reviewers have noted, it is good quality. It is thicker, with cuffed sleeves and a loose waist. I honestly think I like this long-sleeve more than my others, and am gonna buy again and hopefully get both shirts this time.-Edit- I am increasing my rating to 5 starts, because I received the proper amount of shirts this time.

  I bought two of these shirts and washed them in hot water and put them into the clothes dryer and they both came out almost exactly as they were before with no shrinkage. That's rare and I really appreciate it. I ordered two more today. They shirts are not light weight. They are between a normal teeshirt and a very light sweatshirt and that's perfect for me. The collar remained in shape after washing and drying and the sleeves didn't shrink up.

",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2018","









  
  
    
  Gildan makes a long sleeve shirt that is middle of the road in terms of quality. The material is a little bit thin and the sleeve cuffs are a bit too loose and mismatched in tightness on the left and right. The tag is extremely annoying but it comes off easily. I ordered an XL and it arrived too large in the waist, but it actually shrunk after washing and the overall fit is good. I was surprised to find that the color doesn't fade too bad after going through the washer and dryer; very impressive for a $5 shirt.While the shirt quality could be better, its not bad, so I have to give the shirt 4 stars because a plain, solid color shirt is impossible to find anywhere but online. I will buy more in the future.

  Usually large is a little tight and extra-large is a little loose for me. I purchase the extra large and after a wash and dry they sit on my broad shoulders perfectly. I usually have to buy extra large because of wide shoulders. The sleeves and belly length are perfect and I like how the end of the sleeve is tapered slightly.

  I bought these shirts for my husband to use at work. The price is fair for the product. They are not ultra cotton, but they work perfect for working in outdoors. The only thing I don't like is the width of the sleeves in the armpit area, a little bigger than usual, looks a little irregular. The length of the sleeves and the shirt is suitable for the size. I washed them and put them in the dryer. There were no changes in size, but I must wash them multiple times to see the change other buyers have mentioned.

    A shirt that actually fits, I can't believe it
  
",5.0,tqwert1,"Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2019","









  
  
    
  5 stars is maybe a exaggerated for a pretty basic cotton shirt, but I'm just so shocked to try it on and have it actually fit well and look good.  I've become pretty much resigned to being disappointed every time I order a shirt from Amazon.  I don't know why it's so hard to make a shirt with reasonable proportions for someone of more or less average height (I would assume) for a medium size shirt and who is in good physical condition and doesn't have a gigantic gut.  But apparently it is, but I usually get shirts that are way, way too long and wear more like a dress than a shirt and/or have sleeves that are way too long and/or have a gigantic gut that makes the shirt wear like a blouse.  This shirt has a reasonable body length for me at 5'8"", has almost exactly the right sleeve length for me, and it fits nicely and doesn't blouse up in the gut.  It's a nice thickness to add a little extra warmth, the color looks good, and the price was very reasonable.

  The feel and fit of the shirt is really good and leaves some room so it is not tight and gives some space to grow. My only grip is that the sleeve cuffs are a bit wide for my tastes. I would prefer a tighter fit around the wrist and better elasticity for the sleeve cuffs so that when I rolled up my sleeves and then rolled them back down it did not feel stretched out.

  I'm an old woman and bought these shirts as winter sleep shirts.  The material is really heavy cotton but kind of rough, even after a few washes, so I wind up wearing a softer camisole under them.  The cuffs are also snug at the wrist, which for everyday wear is probably great for a guy, but it feels constricting for sleeping.  So for my purposes, not what I wanted.  But they are well-made, well-sewn, of good heavy fabric that will last a long time and are longer than most men's t-shirts I've purchased.  Shrinkage was minimal in the dryer too.

If you buy XL it will continue to fit XL, apparently regardless of the number of times it's washed. I've washed it twice and it is still XL, which is a bit baggy for me currently. I'll certainly try the Large to see if that fits my current size better.

  Scratchy if not washed before wearing. Unraveling at the collar at the first wash. I took the advice of reviews and purchased one size larger so that it would shrink perfectly after the first wash, and it did. It faded at first wash. The shirt is not high quality but it's not terrible either. A small price for 2 lounge shirts is acceptable. Don't expect a lot from this product.

    The weight is between a T-shirt and a sweatshirt
  
",5.0,Fishman,"Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought four of these long sleeve T-shirts: two light gray and two heather gray. The color was exactly as represented and the XL size was spot on. Unlike some long sleeve T-shirts, these are a little heavier and the sleeves don't feel saggy like pajamas. For me, a sweatshirt is too heavy most of the time because if you're dressing for moving between inside and outside in the cool to cold weather when you get inside where the heat's on, it gets too hot. So I like something that's a mid weight and this definitely serves that purpose. Most long sleeve T-shirts are too light weight; they lose their shape and look sloppy after wearing them just a short time. These shirts hold their shape and are just the right weight. I wear the shirts untucked, but they're not to heavy to tuck in. I'm fairly simple in the way I dress, so these are perfect for me.

  For the price, it's hard to complain.  Even so, this is really more of a light-weight sweat shirt than it is a tee.  The fabric is thicker than than that of a tee, and it's definitely coarser.  I had been wanting a tee with ribbed cuffs and had not found one until I saw this advertised.  I dislike the cuffs of most tees because they dangle into whatever.  So in that respect, this is a great shirt.  But I had hoped for something I could throw on after work and even sleep in if I felt so inclined.  This shirt does not fit that bill.  It would be a perfect under-shirt for a camping trip.  The size seemed just a bit small, especially after laundering. Oddly enough, the 10% poly, grey shirt shrank the most  I would order a size up.  I purchased two sets, one of which was red.  It turned out to be an orange red--not my favorite shade of red.

  I was very pleased by the material of these long sleeved t's. It is a good weight cotton that will keep you warm.  Also I could not believe the low price until the seams fell apart. I checked the sewing. They have excellent stitching. But, the person cutting the material must have slipped in areas.  The stitch only caught one piece of material instead of two.  Thus, the seams failed.  Even so, I just grabbed a needle and thread and went to work.  The cotton really is that good.I would compare this product to factory seconds of a name brand.

Fortunately for me the chest/waist are not billowy, but it is the typical ""American"" fit but not so awfully billowy.But... as I'll only wear this around the house and yard, or for running errands, I would re-order.

  These are scratchy, even after multiple washings. They are not soft cotton to begin with, and multiple washings do not make them any softer. I've actually gotten scratch-rashes in the armpits from these. If you want a soft, comfortable cotton, I strongly suggest that you go with Hanes or some other brand that is actually comfortable. These Gildans -- the sizing is good; they don't shrink too much; arm length vs torso dimensions -- all good. So, yes, these are sturdy and seem to be well-made. BUT I would never buy again. They're a nasty-scratchy fabric.

  This t-shirt is a medium weight in fabric. I washed them after they arrived in cold water and then put them in the dryer on delicate for about 5-10 minutes just to get the wrinkles out and then hung them to finish drying.  I don‚Äôt think I would trust them in the dryer until they were entirely dry because they are 100 percent cotton and look like they would shrink.  The fabric is a little scratchy on the skin after washing them.  Not sure if it was due to not drying them completely in the dryer or if it is the material itself.

  This shirt was what I expected. The cotton texture is a little rough, not as soft as my old Eddie Bauer ones, but still OK.I ordered XL since other reviews said it shrinks, which it does. Arm length is now perfect though it's still a loose fit, which I like.Funny that when I ordered it I thought it was a decent price for a shirt but didn't realize it was for 2 until the package arrived. Pleasant surprise! As long as you're not expecting a super soft cotton I definitely recommend these and I'll reorder again. I'd give them a 4.5 stars if I could.

I have other products from Gildan any while they are not real high quality, they were at least acceptable. These are so rough on the skin that I got rubbed raw under my arms from the shirt.Gildan may be a Canadian company, but where is the fabric from, where are they made?

  I love this shirt. It is exactly as advertised and I absolutely would buy again. You are getting exactly what you expect, a clean white long sleeve shirt that has a standard fit. The only reason it's not getting a 5-star rating is that it shrinks about 2 inches when you wash it! I would recommend ordering a size up from what you normally wear because this shirt will shrink, no doubt about it. For reference, I am 6'2"" 175 lbs and wear a Large. The shirt that I washed now no longer reaches my wrists and hardly passes the belt line, while the other that is unwashed fits exactly as you'd expect. I should have ordered an XL in this product, hopefully you all can learn from my mistake!

  The shirt feels like it's itching the back of my neck due to the material made from it. Also, when you reach for anything. The shirt arms cuffs raises up, making the shirt feel small. But I'm 6ft tall, which might be why the shirt feels that way to me in my opinion. I wish the shirt came in ""Tall large"" size, then I would review the product again.The print I got on the shirt looks amazing. And I got alot of compliments on it. So, if you want to go the cheap routine for shirts. I would pick this product and the other colors that it has to offer. *I DON'T recommend buying these shirts for people who are tall or long in height* It will not fit them right even in X-large size because that's the size I got.Overall I would rate this shirt 3.5 out of 5 ‚≠ê on the scale.

  I did not really know what to expect material wise, I just knew that I wanted some long sleeved black shirts and the price seemed decent. After trying the shirts on, they felt a little too tight around the chest for me and tight on the shoulders. Personally, I have a slightly bigger chest size and built arms so the shirt felt like a bit of a strange fit. Material wise it was not soft but not rough either, I think it is the quality I paid for so I am not disappointed about that. All in all I don't think I would wear this when I am out (unless I maybe owned a size bigger) but I would probably us these shirts when doing yard work in cooler weather or when I am out camping in somewhat cold temperatures.

  Pros: only just got them, but seem well made, I got the gray heather, color is what you'd expect, decent price. Cons: it's a very coarse material, more like a rough linen than combed cotton, not really comfortable to wear as a t-shirt but OK to wear over a t-shirt. When I first open the package it gave off a really intense ""chemica""l smell. Didn't go away after one wash, washed it a couple more times also hoping to soften up the material, the smell is still faintly there and the material is still very coarse! The styling is basic ""potato sack""--which is appropriate since that's what the material feels like. Wasn't really sure how to rate these, so I'll just knock one start off for the intense chemical smell, and one for the not very t-shirt like material.

  Basic material. Feels rough definitely not soft. Good for working outdoors I guess. I would say for the money what do you expect but I've come across other shirts in the same price range that's softer. It's not thin it's not thick just that basic T for printing something on it kinda feel. Fits spot on though. Wasn't too big or too small. Will update after wash and dry. Shrinkage happens in the dryer not washer. I'll be sure to dry in low heat. It's not bad but it's not great either. Stitching seems good and there were no loose threads. Sleeves are the right length and so is the shirt. Took forever to get delivered like 3 plus weeks.

  It's a shirt, there is no rocket science to it.The material is reasonably thick and a bit coarse, perfect for regular use. Do note this would not be a good choice to use as an undershirt because of this.The fit is true to size, with the notable exception of there being a slight bagginess on the underarm.All things said, it's a surprisingly good purchase for the price.

  I bought a bunch of these shirts! I bought my husband some in xl and i bought myself some in 4xl. I was originally looking for myself some long sleeve, lightweight shirts that would actually fit me and be long enough around and in the sleeves being as i am a plus size woman and 6'1. Also if you found this same exact shirt in a women's plus size shop, even on Amazon it would probably cost about $25 for one! So this shirt was perfect for myself and my husband!**They are lightweight(in a good way), they do shrink a little in the dryer but not a ton. I personally ordered my shirts one size up from what i normally wear according to the size chart to allow shrinkage in the dryer. They were long enough to go over my chest and stomach and still hit about mid thigh! The sleeves were long enough that they weren't annoyingly short! Over all i love them! In fact after ordering my husband and myself each 2 packs, i went back and ordered myself an extra pack! I recommend!

  T-shirt quality and sizing is better than most.  Sizing, including shirt and sleeve length, is what I would have expected a generation ago before this current age of just making something to technically fit the product description.  Thickness is what a good t-shirt should always be = thick enough to be considered a layer that can be used in most any weather. Not sure about durability only time will tell, but the feel of the material and 2-pack option makes me think that will also be much  better than average.

He's a shorter man (5'8""), so the sleeves are a bit long, but otherwise, we're very pleased with this product.

  Great shirts fr the money, I one several colors. I order XXL and they shrink to the perfect XL size for me. The cloth is very comfortable and warm. The thickness of the material seems to vary by color and when you purchase the shirts. Some of my white long sleeves are thinner than other ones I own. I would suggest this as a good shirt to purchase. Buy one size larger and after a warm wash and drying it will shrink perfectly.

  The fit of these shirts was just a bit more snug than I expected.  If you wear a medium size and want some roominess in the fit, then a large might be a better option.  The shirts appear to be well-made of medium weight cotton.  One caution: these shirts are NOT colorfast.  For their first cleaning I washed them by hand in the sink with Woolite & cold water.  I was right: lots of colored water while washing them.  They will bleed in the washing machine and tint other clothing.

  I bought these shirts for work and decided to wash them and get the new-fabric chemical smell out before I wore them for a full day in the shop. The bottom hem completely came out of both shirts In the dryer and turned all my clothes into a giant, wet, balled up knot. I had to cut away all the thread in order to get everything apart so I could actually dry my clothes. Both shirts are ruined and I never got the chance to wear them.Now, before anyone goes to user error, I followed the washing directions printed on the tag and even erred on the gentler settings for both wash and dry. I also have also owned a textiles business in the past and have done plenty of industrial sewing. This was simply shoddy craftsmanship on the part of whomever sewed these shirts.Save your money and buy something with a little better quality.
