    One adapter to rule them all!
  
",5.0,Jim,"Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased a USB-C a couple months ago, and realized not all hubs are created equal - although it had a USB C pass through port, not all USB-C ports support data & power. Hence when looking again for an all-in-one solution, i am happy to report that the 100w USB-C pass-through works flawlessly (no lag or screen flashes) and finally allow me to have the one cable solution when docking my laptop at home.Since been working from home a lot more, anything I can do to streamline or de-clutter my workspace is a huge benefit to me. Now when I dock my PC, just need to plug in the one USB on the adapter, and ALL my peripherals get connected.  I highly recommend this adapter if you need something reliable or trying to archive the one-cable dream that USB-C can bring.

  Item got over heat when I connect it to my phone like in 30 Minutes. After that, the signal getting bad and I lost some frame.I give this item 3 stars because It does it job, transfer the screen to my TV, and I can use it to connect the flash drive to my phone.However, it only work good in the first 30min. When it get the heat up, everything is not good. Lagging, flashing, losing picture, screen yurn black for few minutes.

    Cool hub for Galaxy s10e
  
",5.0,Gerald H.,"Reviewed in the United States April 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  Awesome little USB c hub. I bought this hoping it would work with s10e and it does, and more importantly lets me use Linux on Dex right out of the box. My only issue was it had problems mirroring the screen, until I plugged in external power. I haven't tried the ethernet or sd card slots yet, but I'm assuming they'll work like everything else so far. Would definitely recommend for the price, much cheaper than some other options on here.

    Won't keep a Pixel 3 charged, but everything else works great
  
",4.0,Borys B,"Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have the following setup:Monitor -> HDMI -> HubPixel 3 -> USB-C to USB-A cable -> HubPower -> Pixelbook charging cable to USB-C -> HubRouter -> Ethernet -> HubHub -> USB-C -> PixelbookThe Pixel 3 device plugged into the USB-C to USB-A cable is charging slowly. It is stating that it will take 6 hours to go from 38% to 100% with the device not in use. I was hoping to use this hub for mobile software development, which requires my phone to be on. Unfortunately, the hub does not provide enough charging to make this a possibility.EDIT: Aukey sent me a new hub. It still says ""Charging slowly"" when the Pixel 3 is plugged into the hub, even if an external power source is plugged into the USB-C port. The phone estimates that charging from 86% to 100% will take about an hour. I hope that Aukey creates a better hub in the future. I am very satisfied with the rest of the functionality (ethernet, HDMI, availability of USB ports), but I have not tried the SD card slot.EDIT 2: I've noticed that my ethernet has only been running at 100 mbps. I've tried two different cables - Cat7 and Cat5e with no luck. All other wired devices on my network are able to have a gigabit connection.

    MacbookPro ports upgrade
  
",4.0,L.Lopez,"Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  Been using AUKEY products for a while. All are good quality and performs as advertised. This 8 to 1,  C port upgrade unit performs flawlessly. Full MacBook compatibility, good ports  speed. Not 5 stars,  cause it heats above my expectations. It's not an oven, but I think probably any component will fail soon, due to the heat generated by the unit.

    Works perfectly, and it's nice that it comes with it's own bag
  
",5.0,Customer,"Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  I got this to help with my work from home set up on my MacBook, and it seemed to have everything I need. I especially liked that it has a higher power output than other similar items (which is probably more than I need anyway). The ethernet works fast, and I got regular, good speeds compared to other adapters I have. The rubber feet on the bottom are a really nice detail, and it has a premium feel to it. The cable is a good length. Overall, I think this item is well deserving of it's good praise. I can't think of anything else you could add to this adapter to make it better, save an additional USB-C port.

    8-in1 Type - C HUB  | Quality Hub  | Everything you need for a HUB | USB - C Power Charge
  
",5.0,Anthony Ramirez,"Reviewed in the United States April 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  Hub 8-in-1 is slim and reliable and offers great value. Other hubs may be cheaper, but offers fewer ports. The 8- in 1 hub was all that was needed to plug in the following for my personal setup: 1- USB (for mouse) 2- USB (for keyboard keyboard) 3- USB-C to plug in the computer charger (worked both on my Mac and PC) 4- Ethernet plug to power my highest speeds instead of using wifi (highly recommend) 5- Other plugs are useful but haven't had a chance to use it with my daily work/ personal setupThe biggest pro for this hub is being able to plug in my USB-C computer charger to the hub. This was able to charge my 2016 Macbook Pro and HP Elitebook.

  I got this for my new M1 MacBook Air. I had trouble with my ethernet adapter for Big Sur on my old MacBook but the ethernet port works just fine with this product. It comes with a small carrying case which is a nice touch. All in all, I'm very satisfied with the usb hub. The cable that connects to the MacBook is long enough that I plan to use command strips to attach the back of the usb hub to the back of my external monitor to help with cable management.

    Weird glitch but great customer service
  
",4.0,Amazonian,"Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2021","









  
  
    
  This product ended up not working out for me but I still think Aukey is a quality brand and continue to use many of their other products. Their customer service was prompt, clear, and conscientious. I had some trouble using their website’s complaint submission form (faulty error message) but it eventually sent my message after a dozen attempts. Fortunately all subsequent customer service conversations took place via email.My problem with the product was with all of its USB A ports. They seem underpowered or something because my (Aukey) wireless phone charger would power on and off about every 10-15 seconds. Needless to say, that is not how the charger is supposed to function. It works fine with power blocks and other USB A ports on other computers. My Aukey USB C to USB A nano adapter (comes in a two pack and is just dandy) also works fine with my MacBook and the charger. So it’s the hub. It doesn’t matter which USB A port I tried, same outcome. HOWEVER, the USB A ports did work perfectly with my wireless mouse’s receiver. I tried the Ethernet ports and the power pass through and those also worked fine. Aukey kindly sent me a replacement right away but the same exact thing happened with the wireless charger again so I’m back to looking for a multi-port hub that works with all my common peripherals.

    One of the best USB-C Hub out there. Super functional, works across ecosystems and connector types
  
",5.0,K. Shah,"Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I travel quite a bit for work and working from home these days. I have been looking for a USB-C hub where I can connect multiple devices and free up the connection space on my computer. I have other Aukey products in the house (including car dash cams, charges, cases etc) so it is a trusted brand for me and the connectivity options and price was really good so decided to give this a chance. I'm glad I did.Usage and connectivity:First, I connected the usb-c charging cable from my Lenovo laptop charger as input to power the hub and other devices connected to it. It sits perfectly on my desk, has a very small footprint and I now have a bunch of devices connected to it. My wide screen monitor is connected to it via an HDMI cable. I tested the audio and it is working great. In addition I have got my keyboard and the cable coming out of the usb c hub is connected to the usb-c port on my laptop so everything is working perfectly. Laptop is charging perfectly while all peripherals are working as expected.Look, feel, size and otherThis hub is very slim and has nice matt finish on top. It also came with a little cloth sleeve that I'm planning to store the hub which protects the surface.Overall, I'd say you can't go wrong with this hub and I highly recommend it. Very satisfied with it so far.

  Since having my MacBook Pro 2017 15"", I have had three usb-c hubs. This one is the best of them all. Build quality and form factor are great. It small and great for travel and will easily fit in your notebook sleeve. All the usb 3.0 ports run true to speed swell as the ethernet port. Hubs in the past have let me down in this area. The price is also great. Thanks again to Aukey for another great product !!! Bonus: the hub came with a cloth sleeve for storage too! its in the details!

    100% functional with iPad Pro 2018, no HDMI with nintendo Switch V1/V2 models
  
",5.0,The General,"Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  This review is intended for iPad Pro 2018 owners running iPadOS 13.4 -Short and easy review:All ports work, HDMI outputs properly, USB 3.0 ports function as fast as the device connected, microSD/SDCard slots all work and speeds are dependent on your SD card specs.iPad Pro 2018 - best thing about this hub is the USB 2.0 port!  I can connect my logitech USB receiver and allow my paired logitech keyboard and mouse to function on the ipad pro without interference and lag rather than use up the bluetooth bandwidth.The ethernet also works (see images) - but iPadOS is limited to 100Mb/s that is 100 megabits per second.  Pathetic considering wifi will net you 5x the bandwidth!The hub can be powered WITHOUT a power via usb-c.  In fact you can plug into your ipad pro and it will work!  Great for just using the usb 2.0 port to use keyboard/mouse in a quick setting.  At your desktop you can plug in AC adapter via usb-c to get full power.  I have a 63watt aukey PD AC adapter powering the hub so I did not test with apple’s own 18watt power supply.For nintendo switch: you can plug in and it will work without external power - if you plug in an external usb-c power supply it will charge the nintendo switch while powering the hub.  The logitech usb receiver i used worked flawlessly on the switch without external power to the hub!  The mouse did not, obviously.  The ethernet did not as well.  It only will work when I plug in my usb3.0 to ethernet adapter and it worked 100%.  This was also tested with and WITHOUT external power supply and it worked on the nintendo switch.  The hdmi doesn’t work with the Nintendo switch. I believe there is a specific hammy output device required and this aukey hub isn’t the right one.  I have the V2 model that was tested upon.The only CON i would have to make up is probably “heat” - but it’s not hot to touch - it does get warm with ethernet connected but i do not see any thing else to complain about.  The LED light is useful to tell me there is power connected.  The ethernet flashes up white and orange when data is transferring.A solid device by a solid company: AUKEY - i chose this brand over the other generic chinese brands because I was dubious if it would work with my ipad pro 2018 but in the end i’m glad i went with this brand.iPadOS 13.4 is great - Files apps can read all the devices connected to the usb and sd card slots (one at a time) - and it makes this ipad even better than a full size laptop!5 stars for product quality and performance.

    Perfect USB-C hub for traveling - all needed ports available
  
",5.0,Garrett,"Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is the perfect USB-C hub to use when traveling.  It's very lightweight and has every port you'll need:  3 USB 3.0s, SD Card, Micro-SD Card, HDMI, Ethernet, and another USB-C to plug-in power if need be.  The only negative is known when purchasing - there's only one HDMI port.  However, Aukey offer's another hub for twice the price with more ports if needed.The USB ports transfer at full speed, the HDMI sent 4K to my TV when connected, and the ethernet pulled over 100 Mbps (max of my network).  The build quality feels great - like all of Aukey's other products.The price is right for the features, and the travel bag included is a nice touch!  Would highly suggest this model if it has all the needed ports.  The quality, size, and price all come together for 5 stars!

  I've had this for just under a week at this point and have already returned/repalced the first one. It wasn't keeping the Ethernet connection, it would disconnect and reconnect, kind of annoying. This replacement one keeps dropping the usb connections. I'll turn my PC on and the keyboard won't work. I have updated and uninstalled/reinstalled drivers and nothing seems to fix the issue. I may look for an alternative to this one if I keep having issues.9/15/2020 Update:Device works as it should, but still having the Ethernet connectivity issue. Are others having this issue? I've turned off power saving features through device manager, yet it still takes 30-40 seconds, if not longer, to connect. I feel as thought the device should connect within 3-5 seconds.9/23/2020 Update:Not only is the Ethernet port a constant problem, now the USB ports aren't responding until I either restart or unplug/plug the device back in. This defeats the purpose of the device. I bought it so I could leave the devices plugged in under my laptop stand and plug the USB-C into my PC and be done. Having to pull the whole thing out and go through it is just a PITA. I am not past my return period and stuck with the device.2/5/2021 Update:I would like to say that this product has exceeded my expectations. It wasn't a problem with the product, but it was an issue with my managed switch. Great product for what it does!

  The first hub I received, kept getting disconnected from my Macbook Pro 16, because it was drawing too much power. Aukey replaced it, but the replacement would not properly pass through the 96W charge, so my laptop would drain quickly under heavy loads. It looked like the charge was capped at 60W according to CoconutBattery, even though the hub is supposed to support up to 100W pass-through. The replacement of the replacement kept charging/not charing every few minutes, so my laptop would not charge at all. Tried three hubs and three failed. The quality from its look and feel seems to be pretty decent, but it simply did not function as expected. So, the reason that this product is 2-stars is only because the customer service has been good. Otherwise, I would not recommend the product until the quality issues are fixed.

  I like this USB C hub mainly because it is really light weight and easy to carry around, however I would like it much better if its USB C cable and the connector were made of better quality material. Also, another drawback that I feel is that the USB-C port (Power delivery port) literally only delivers power and you can't plug any USB-C device such as your phone in that port. It's only for the charger cable. Would have really liked if it were a power+data USB-C port.

I can charge my computer, use a memory stick, connect my laptop to a TV screen with the HDMI, among other things.  BTW it also comes with a carry case.  I am so glad I purchase it.

  I purchased this essentially as a docking station for my laptop - plugging my monitor, network cable, and a handful of peripherals all into this hub so I could easily unplug my laptop from everything all at once when I needed to take it somewhere, rather than unplugging half a dozen different devices separately.The USB ports, card slots and Ethernet port all worked great, but I was unable to test the HDMI port because unfortunately I learned that my laptop's type C port is USB 3.1 which does not support HDMI.That said, Aukey was really great to work with. I emailed them (before I knew about my incompatibility issue) and they immediately sent out a replacement hub. When the second hub also didn't work, I did some more research on my laptop, and found out about the USB 3.1 issue, and I finally sent the hub back to Aukey. The hub looks and feels great. Very well designed. I've purchased other Aukey hubs in the past and I've found them to be high quality.

  This thing doesn't really have 100 watt pass-through - it delivers only 60 watts.My charging brick is 94w, so I plug it directly into my MacBook, and simply plug the Aukey into another Thunderbolt 3 port. This allows the Powerbook to charge at full speed and handle power distribution however it wants to.I discovered this today after waking up and discovering the Powerbook had completely drained (probably due to Steam) using iStat Menus to discover what was really going on with power delivery.

  I have been using this adapter everyday since purchasing it. I’ve had it on my wish list since June 2020, but kept hesitating to buy it because 2020...I really shouldn’t have waited! This hub can be used with so many of my devices for a much more stable connection than Wi-Fi. In a time when everything is done remotely I need to be sure my connection doesn’t drop from poor signal. This resolves that issue. So far I’ve used it on my 2018 iPad Pro, 2019 MacBook Pro, and my Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra with great success. With the Android it also enables Ethernet tethering! When I connect it to my laptop I’m able to use traditional USB accessories and drives while also charging it. It has Power Delivery passthrough which is a fantastic feature if you need to charge your devices while using the hub.

Other adapters don't have this issue on same phone. I don't have a second one to compare results and isolate the issue. Otherwise the rest of the ports work great, even using Samsung Dex.

  This dock is the perfect match to go with my HP ZBook Studio G5. The laptop does not have a built in ethernet port for hard wiring to get network access. When I am working with large amounts of data and large files this is a must to ensure reliable remote work while traveling. The dock is well built and has nice rubber feet to keep it planted on the desk and not sliding around. The dock has a 6 inch cable attached which is plenty long to get it away from the laptop without being too long that it is a problem when putting in your bag for travel. The extra HDMI and USB ports are a nice plus to help keep things all in one place and not have cables everywhere to connect several peripherals. The dock comes with a very nice pouch to keep the dock protected when in your bag and keeping it form getting beat up. I have always been impressed with Aukey products and this one is no different. I would recommend this dock to anyone looking for a reliable dock for travel and work from home if you only need to connect one external display.

Carrying one device which does everything you need keeps your carry bag clear of clutter. A short cable to attach it to your computer is permanently attached to the hub, so you won't ever need to search for a cable just to use your hub.

    Significant Coil Whine for 100W PD, and USB C port isn't usable aside from PD
  
",3.0,JJ,"Reviewed in the United States December 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  Overall, very functional hub. However, two very important points:- I have an XPS 17 9700 that comes with a 130W charger over USB C (this is proprietary). I expected to use this hub with the 100W PD to pass through ~100W of power. It seems like it may have been capable of doing that, but at very loud coil whine. So loud that I absolutely cannot use it. Not sure if mine is defective, but I'm back to plugging power directly into the laptop.- With power going to the laptop and not the USB-C port, I thought I would have a spare USB C port now available for use on the hub. However, it seems like it isn't actually a usable port; devices connected there were not able to be recognized on my laptop. Perhaps I should have read more closely, but I (incorrectly) assumed that the port was functional beyond power. Don't plan on using it!I'm debating returning this as a lot of the desired ""just plug one cable in"" is limited because of this. May have to look for more expensive ""docks"" instead.

  I received this and has been using with my new MBP 16"" for a day. I was looking forward for a hub that gives me additional classic USB port, ethernet, HDMI and the additional SD card slots make it see like this is the perfect deal for me. However, I've been using this today and the power keeps cutting in and out (it cuts off for a second or less and goes back to power mode; with the screen dimmed for a short second, and power plug connection chime on my Mac keeps going off every minute which is very annoying.) The MacBook is connected to the original mac power brick (95W), and has no issues when connected direct to the MBP USB-C port. This only happens when I leverage the PD USB-C port through the hub. I have nothing being driven off of the hub except a logitech receiver and a hdmi cable driving a 4k monitor.I have a number of Aukey chargers and devices and have good luck with them, but not so on this one so far, makes me think I might have a defective unit that doesn't provide a consistent power delivery to the macbook pro.

Performance is basically the same as plugged in directly.It has a Realtek RTL8153 gigabit ethernet controller, connected through the internal USB hub. The USB-C port is charging only (pretty typical with these hubs). It does not appear to have any fast charging for phones.

    A great USB-C Hub for my MacBook Pro
  
",5.0,H. Chou,"Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have a 2017 edition 13"" MacBook Pro with 4 USB C ports and no USB 3.0 or Lightning interfaces.  Before I purchased this hub, I used one Anker USB C hub with an Ethernet port AND one USB C HDMI adapter to connect to my existing display, optical mouse, external USB3.0 HDD and printer (USB2.0).  This USB C hub is very thin and compact.  It greatly preserves some precious real estate on my desk as I have a Surface Pro and a Lenovo also on my desk for some applications that only run on Windows.  One thing I wasn't expecting was that this USB-C hub can passthrough power from the power adapter while using this USB-C hub (there is a USB-C port on the hub) with other devices.  While I have 3 other USB-C ports on the MacBook Pro, so this isn't that big of a deal, but I'm sure this is useful for laptops that don't have many USB-C ports.  The USB-C hub does provide power to my external HD and DVD/CD drives.  I have an external HDD (USB 3.0) that I run Mac Time Machine and I was able to power the external HDD and run complete backup without problems.  This hub had no issues powering my DVD drive, which is another USB 3.0 device. Plugged my mouse into the USB2 port, and everything is good there.The HDMI works correctly with my display and no complaints there.  The display with audio/video works fine with the HDMI.  One thing that was a nice surprise was that the Ethernet port worked much better compared to my Anker USB-C hub with an Ethernet port.  My previous USB-C hub took a while for the MacBook Pro to discover and usually took several minutes to connect to the network and obtain an IP address through DHCP.  What I noticed with this one was the connection to the network was much faster, and usually, in less than 30 seconds, my MacBook was connected, had an IP address, and was able to start surfing or browsing.  I have not run any speed test to see if the port was actually running at gigabit speed, but it's not as critical to me even if it didn't run at gigabit speed.  The SD card slot was nice to have.  I do have a separate USB SD card reader and now I can pack it away.  I had the USB-C hub almost connected full and every device was working properly without any noticeable slowdown.All in all, I'm pleased with this hub and I have been using it daily for about a week now it.

  I've always had good experience with Aukey products (cables, chargers, usb battery pack) so when I needed an all-in-one hub for my MacBook pro I just checked out Aukey brand. So this hub is an 8 in 1 usb C hub. Has all the ports that one would need nowadays (hdmi, sdxc, 100W usb c (charging), 2 usb 3.0, SD, Ethernet and USB-A). It's small form factor means fits perfectly in my small backpack. The usb c cord is about 7"" which is fair. I like the fact that the ports all have decent spacing so that it doesn't cram/block the other ports if you are using them. My MacBook picked up each port's devices when using them without hesitation. Bonus is the 100W usb c charging port to keep my MacBook charged at all times. My only concern is that it's quite light (plastic) and I feel that if it falls on the ground it may crack (haven't occurred yet). But then they do have a 18 month warranty so I guess I'm good.  I would highly recommend this product.

    Great adapter for USB C laptops
  
",5.0,Jim W.,"Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I used this adapter with a 2016 Macbook Pro.  It worked excellently with my USB keyboard and mouse.  The USB C power delivery provided sufficient power to charge the laptop from 30% to full in about 2 hours.  It also provided excellent wired internet with a cat 6 cable.  There is a small green LED when it is plugged in, and the Ethernet plug also had activity lights on the back.  It comes with a nice cloth carrying case as well.

    Excellent Low-Profile USB C Hub with Great Functions
  
",5.0,Justin Michael,"Reviewed in the United States September 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  This USB C hub checks all of my boxes for what I need to support my Microsoft Surface Pro 7.Pros:The Aukey 8-in-1 Type USB C Adapter is low profile, looks great, and has a wide range on connections that help me get the most out of my Surface Pro and MacBook Pro. This would pair well with a MacBook Pro, Chromebook or any slim portable that sports USB C but needs some additional connections.This is perfect if you need to share video via HDMI to a monitor or TV especially as many monitors still do not support a USB C input. It is an excellent secondary display adapter.Because I travel often for work, the addition of the ethernet port was my deciding factor in picking up this hub. Having the option to hardline into a router with my Surface or Mac has been a quality of life improvement when I encounter spotty WIFI connections that would otherwise disrupt my video calls and streaming.The design of this hub complements the look of my Surface and my MacBook Pro. The ports sit below the top of the hub on a beveled edge which helps their bare metal components hide from the eye. An indicator light, opposite the Aukey brand on the top of the hub, is a soft green rather than the harsh blue LED that is so common on cheaper looking hubs and gadgets. The bottom of the hub has four rubber feet to help it stay planted on your table and prevents the plastic body from dragging around and causing noise. It is a great addition to my tech kit.Other Pros:Indicator LED included on Ethernet port.Attractive fabric storage sleeve for hub included in boxRecyclable cardboard boxCons:I would have liked the cable to be a few inches longer and maybe made with a softer, braided cable. The rigidity of the rubber coated cable coupled with it's short length is a bit of a problem for my Surface Pro 7 as the USB C port on the Surface is located on the top right edge of the tablet when it is set up in a laptop position. The hub hangs awkwardly to the side of the screen. This has not killed the experience for me and I am still very happy with this excellent USB C hub.This is also not an issue with the MacBook Pro and should not be an issue with any traditional laptop that has its ports along the edges of its base.I highly recommend this product.

  I'm updating this review to add that as soon as Aukey saw that I had a problem, their customer service contacted me right away and did a full refund.  This is really impressive for an online service.  As I wrote, it worked with my external 2.0 hard drives but not with my cameras.  Otherwise it's a good product, solid build, elegant on the desktop and handles high-speed internet connections for livestreaming well. My two power-hungry jobs for this hub are to transfer video footage from avchd cameras via USB 2.0 connections to my 2018 MacBook Pro and also to ingest video/audio via Blackmagic intensity shuttle USB 3.0.It so far works well with the shuttle 3.0 at the same time as handling high speed internet vis Cat 6 connection.But so far it doesn’t like transferring footage. Often it doesn’t find the camera; when it does it drops the signal midstream and I get a message that the drive was incorrectly disconnected.As a work around I’m using my old Anket USB powered hub, plugging that into the Aukey hub and plugging that into my MacBook Pro.I only have 1 camera plugged in at a time and no additional drives. And I have the USB-C power cable plugged into an Apple power brick.Let me know if I’m missing anything. Otherwise the USB 3 ports seem under powered for this type of connection.

  So far just use it for connecting monitor via HDMI and power, and a USB-A connection here and there. When I get bat to the office I expect to use it for the wired network as well. Sometimes I have to disconnect the power cable and reattach to reset things if the external monitor isn't working. I use this in a combination with a magnetic USB-C adapter to make the connection even easier and sometimes I'm not sure if the issue is with the magnetic connector not being lined up, or the hub. Usually the magnetic connector, but once in a while just need to reset things by unplugging power cable plugged into USB-C port on the hub.

But I've decided to give AUKEY a better review because their customer service is great. Not many sellers on Amazon will go to the lengths they have to please a customer.---This was a great solution until it wasn't. The other night I saw a flash, my monitors turned on and then off. I investigated and noticed this little hub was super hot. I unplugged everything, let it cool off and then plugged it back in. The USB-C port on my MacBook Air wouldn't recognize anything, which made me believe it had fried the port.I tested the port with another hub and everything worked. So this hub was the culprit. I couldn't get my USB keyboard, external drive and multiple thumb drives to work with it either.This is a shame because it has all of the right ports for the work I need to do. I will not be purchasing a replacement hub from Aukey.I hope this helps.

",4.0,Illustrious,"Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  So all of the ports that I've tried so far will work... However, it will let you plug in more stuff than will work without really giving you any way of knowing that you've reached too much power draw except things will randomly stop working.For example, the main reason I wanted this was because my pc only has one usb 3.0 port, and I need to move files from my phone to an external ssd that I use for video editing/work.  This just barely worked, until I started using an sd card in my phone.  Apparently the slight extra power draw from there being an sd card in my phone was too much.  My computer was giving me a really weird error that made me worry that my external ssd had been broken.  I can still do what I need to because this goes through the usb c so I still have my usb 3, but I thought I was buying something where I wouldn't need to worry about this type of thing.

  After reaching out to Aukey Customer Service twice through their website, I still have not received a response about my issues with my USB-C hub CB-C71. I bought this adapter last year (and it’s within the 24-month warranty). Figuring that maybe it was just this one adapter being potentially faulty with pass-through charging, I purchased the CB-C88 model as a replacement.As of this writing, I haven’t received a response from Aukey’s customer service team, and my 16” MacBook Pro cannot charge through the USB-C port in this hub. For reference, I’m using the official Apple 96W power block and official 2m Apple USB-C charging cable and can only successfully charge my 16” MacBook Pro by not using this hub and plugging in the charing cable directly into one of the 4 built-in USB-C ports on the 16” MacBook Pro.Until Aukey figures out what is wrong about why pass-through charging doesn’t work, I’d advise not purchasing this USB-C hub CB-C71 or CB-C88.

  It does what it says on the tin. I'm using it for work with a 2019 16"" MacBook Pro, and it drives a 2K display at 60Hz and a USB 3.0 external hard disk just fine...usually.I unplug the hub from my MacBook every night. Sometimes, when plugging it back in, the hard drive doesn't connect (and more rarely, the display doesn't either), and there's a high-pitched whine coming from the device. It's possible it's trying to draw too much power at once to drive both devices, or is getting some interference from the other adapter I have connected for my third display. Unplugging the drive from the hub, or the hub from the computer, and plugging it back in resolves the issue, but it happens about once a week.Overall, it's a solid little hub for the price, especially compared to the price point of some more advanced MacBook-compatible hubs (>$200), but you may have trouble if you try to connect more than a couple of things to it at once.

  This works as advertised with one very strange issue that took me a while to figure out.  My home network consists of a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter X, a couple unmanaged switches, and two Unifi AP AC Lites.  Somehow, if I unplug this hub from my laptop but leave the power and ethernet plugged into the hub, it takes my wifi network down completely.  I'm not sure if it floods the network with enough traffic to crash the AP's, but it absolutely kills the wifi completely.  Every single device on the wifi will lose connection and the wifi will not return until I plug the hub back into my laptop or I remove the power or ethernet cable from the hub.

For $30 this is a steal, don't go out and buy those $80 ones, this one is as efficient if not better than the competition. Aukey is a reputable brand, their design language in packaging and aesthetics represent the quality of their products. I have purchased Aukey products in the past, it does what it says it will do and then some. This is a compact product and the design is very minimal and easy to carry. Comes with a nice premium pouch for your on-the-go needs. Overall a very solid product for the price, I will look for more Aukey products in the future if needed.TLDR: Great value for price, small compact design, good aesthetic quality

  Overall, this USB-C hub does exactly what it claims to do, it easily connects three USB devices (2 3.0, 1 2.0), and ethernet cable, HDMI output, normal and micro SD, and USB-C power to a laptop. I tested it on my 2020 Dell XPS laptop and it had no issues. It is compact and only weighs 61 grams, which should make it easy to fit into any bag.The only two drawbacks I have for it are that the build quality is very light plastic, so I don't know how durable it will be for the long haul, and that it seems to heat up a decent amount. That being said, it has a very generous 24 month warranty, and I'm sure any of those issues would be easily remedied by Aukey.

  I really like this USB C dongle. I've been looking for one that I can use with my new 2020 iPad Pro 12.9 and my HP 14 Chromebook. I needed to be able to plug in my flash drive into to get things to and from my Chromebook and iPad Pro. I also needed a dongle that could be used for my Chromebook to connect to HDMI. It's a bonus that includes an ethernet port. I actually didn't expect my iPad Pro to support ethernet so I was shocked that it plugged right in and worked.I really like the SD card slot. It has both the micro SD and regular sized SD so I can pull out pictures from my Sony digital camera just using the SD card. I can edit my pictures on my iPad using my pencil. I like that.I like how it includes several different things I need in one small package that doesn't get in the way. I think it's a great companion for the Ipad Pro.

This is noted in the description but the USB C port is for power input ONLY.  The USB C port on the hub cannot be used to connect another device such as an external hard drive, external monitor, or even to charge a phone.  It is really for charging input only!

    Great USB-C Hub with good carrying pouch...
  
",5.0,David L,"Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  Got this to replace an 8-in-1 hub that I accidentally left in the business center of the hotel... oops~! So thankful that I am able to get a replacement so quickly with Amazon Prime! This actually had a lot in common with the old one I have, but there are some differences to note.USB 3 ports: Unlike the previous hub I have (and most 8-in-1s for that matter), this one actually has 3x USB 3 ports. 2 on one side, and one on the other. Many 8-in-1s only do two USB 3 ports and one USB 2.0 ports. This is quite nice in my opinion.USB-C PD Passthru: The AUKEY version supports 100W while my older one only does 60W. It doesn't really matter too much for my laptop since mine only takes in 60W max, but it may make a difference for more power-hungry laptops like Macbooks.Power Consumption: Although most everything is the same, the power consumption is among one of the lower ones I have seen. This unit draws 0.10W on idle without Ethernet and 0.15W when Ethernet is plugged in. Other hubs I have seen generally use 0.2 or 0.3W of power. This may not sound like a big difference, although it would matter over time if you are on battery power.Ethernet Lights: I am not sure whether or not I like this yet, but this unit emits a white Ethernet activity light instead of your normal green light. It does add a bit of cool factor to this thing, although some folks may be disturbed by blinking white lights. It's not too bright though given that they have designed the activity lights to be tugged down below the casing. I probably will still try taping over it at night though when it is pitch black.Carrying Pouch: I really like this pouch. It's compact and the hub has a tight fit about the size of my mouse (unlike most other bags where the hub is loose inside the bag that can cause it to be scratched up inside). It also has a little side pouch on the outside that you can stick the USB-C connector in so it does not end up scratching up everything else in your bag. This is a very nice design compared to the other one I had (which had the side pouch on the inside and you have to play around with the bag to get it to close and tugged in properly. Having it on the outside just makes everything so much easier.As for similarities, this (and among pretty much everything else) uses the same Ethernet chipset (Realtek RTL8153). In fact, my Windows laptop actually detected this as my old device when I plugged it in. That doesn't really bother me too much per se, although I find it to be a bit interesting.One thing that I was able to do with this hub that I didn't realize I could do is to use this as a card reader on my Android device. This is quite useful when I am on the go and I need to modify the contents of a microSD card on a phone that does not have an SD slot (i.e. most modern phones). As an example, I was able to download my dashcam firmware while I was outside in the car to the SD card without dragging my laptop along with me. The device was plug and play and no additional drivers were needed. The Android kernel didn't pick up the Ethernet side though, although it will most likely depend on what kernel you are using.Just like anything else AUKEY, I find that they are a good value alternative to ANKER which I personally believe has become too expensive. Definitely give this one a go if you need something light and portable for your USB-C devices.

  This hub is inexpensive, doesn't require a separate power source and basically works. My major disappointments are:1) if your bed and office are the same room (as I suspect is true for many quarantining), the ethernet port has really annoying lights that are impossible to turn off that blink every few seconds. So does the top but that's a lot easier to block. I'm at the point that I unplug my ethernet every night which is a really dumb solution to a problem they should have just solved.2) Only supports 4K @ 30hz. I use a 2K monitor and it can run it at 60hz but that still kinda sucks. My understanding is they're pushing USB3 (the data transfer standard that your USB-c shaped port uses) to the limits by supporting 4K @ 30hz. However, my laptop has a Thunderbolt port... I wish it could take advantage of the additional transfer speed.

  Aukey is known for its high-quality products. It is not the only brand I buy, but is one of the brands I trust. This USB-C adapter has a variety of ports, including 4k HMDI. It is especially helpful that it has pass-through power. In my opinion, it is worth the premium price over other less versatile adapters.

    AUKEY saves the day allowing me to extend my display to dual monitors

  I am a big fan of AUKEY products. The brand has never disappointed me. I was one of the first few to try out their Bluetooth true wireless headset from Amazon , loved it so much that I got 2 more format in-laws, however someone stole mine and I just lost interest. I also purchased a wireless charger from AUKEY recently from Amazon  and it works as expected.I moved into my new office few weeks back and I had an opportunity to opt for dual monitors. I had a MacBook Pro that I own abs I wanted to extend the display to 3. I wanted an adapter/dock that would work with my MacBook Pro to extend my desktop to 3 displays (one MacBook + 2 desktops) . The problem was that these desktops didn’t have an HDMI port. These were old desktops with VGA and DVI ports.So I wanted an adapter that allowed a pass through Power Delivery to MacBook + Ethernet port so that I can have high speed uninterrupted internet and an HDMI port. I just needed these three. And that’s what I got with AUKEY usb c hub (yes it also had usb A abs a few other inputs)I got a HDMI to VGA cable from Amazon for one monitor to connect to the HDMI port in the AUKEY adapter. I also bought a usb c to DVI cable from Amazon to connect my other monitor to the usb c port directly in the MacBook.This worked beautifully well for my use case to use with 2 old non HDMI Monitors.It’s compact and that was super important to me, light weight and works really really well. I didn’t need something bulky with so many extra ports and I just got lucky with this one

  Overall, good product - I've been using it with my XPS 17 9700 which uses Thunderbolt and it works well. Tested HDMI output, ethernet, and data transfer speeds via USB and mini SD card - all great, especially for its size and portability. I've used it both as a standalone adapter (no power input), as well as with power delivery, which is great. It also doesn't heat up using power pass-through. However, my only complaint is that the product makes an irritating noise when it is allowing power pass-through, especially noticeable in quiet environments.

    Mac Users - Be careful with Ethernet
  
",2.0,Barbara Choisnet,"Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is an interesting situation. One that I don't think you'd read a review about or potentially was even tested in product development.The reason this is a 2 star for me is because when I disconnect this hub from my Mac - the internet in my entire house shuts off. Read on for whats actually happening.I have a wired (ethernet) connection from my router to my hub and the hub directly into my Mac. The Hub has an HDMI cable connected, the Mac power supply connected, and the ethernet connected. When I disconnect the hub from my computer, the data LED on the ethernet socket goes crazy, signifying that a lot of data is going through the hub, even though it is disconnected from my computer. As soon as I unplug the ethernet cable, my house internet comes back online. (Im assuming the hub is railing my internet and my ISP/router is shutting down the internet thinking its been hacked.)Trying to figure out the deeper issue, I think the power cord is additionally powering the hub so that when the hub isn't plugged into a computer, the hub is still a device transmitting information which is causing the ethernet port to go crazy resulting in the internet being shut down for all devices.I wish this could be tested by AUKEY. When I tried this same setup on an Anker hub, no internet issues. Because of this, not only do I need to unplug the hub from my laptop, I then need to unplug the ethernet cable from the hub, which somewhat defeats the purpose of having one thing to disconnect.

  EDIT: Their customer service came through and provided a replacement device in addition to a refund.So, all in all this is a very good device. It does most of what is advertised. I'm having one issue and one annoyance with it though.The issue I'm having is that despite it saying it has 100W USB-PD passthrough, I cannot get it to push more than 60W through with a 90W charger. This means that if I dock my laptop and am using it, it will not charge at all the whole time I use it (note that this is a 16"" MacBook Pro, I imagine if you have a 13"" this would be a non-issue).My annoyance has to do with the ethernet port. For whatever reason instead of going with the standard green and amber lights that everyone else uses the activity light is a massively bright white LED. So when I'm using my laptop, the wall behind my computer is CONSTANTLY flashing. Eventually I taped over it, which solved the problem, but man that's annoying.

  Aukey makes very good peripherals and this is just another example.

Additionally, this supports USB power delivery so you can plug your power cable into the hub and get all the additional ports without sacrificing your USB-C port for charging.

Hidden ethernet portUnlike other hubs with an open ethernet port, this one hides the port perfectly. You can hardly see it's plugged in.4. Carry pouchThis carry pouch they provided for free is not a random cheap one. It fits perfectly to the hub and is well stitched. Never feel awkward taking it around (You know how badly designed and material other sellers may use)Besides all these, they also provide a book of instructions. You can tell they spent time on writing it. Very detailed introduction. You can't find fault with such a beautiful artwork.

  I've used everything from Apple, Anker, and Satechi dongles  and all the way up the price ladder to the Caldigit TS3 dock. I think the Anker USB-C dongle is the gold standard to beat and I have no regrets at this price point. I was looking for an extra USB port for my wireless mouse dongle (I hate bluetooth issues and use an external keyboard and camera) and since this came with 3 USB-A ports it fit the bill. Additionally the 100W USB-PD pass through lets me charge my work 15"" MBP (87W charger) sufficiently while other dongles limited you to 65W max which meant you were more likely to plug in the power cable separately if you needed a quick charge. The rubber matte finish on top completes the package as its sleek and hides on my black desk.Some gripes I might have are the Ethernet lights are always on even if I'm not connected so it lights up the room at night even if no laptop is plugged in. And really wish the USB-C cable was just a tad longer maybe an extra 6 inches. I also don't like bright lights so I put black electrical tape on top of the green LED to remove distractions (would prefer it be removed entirely). And though I know there are technical limitations but would love to see a version with DisplayPort instead of HDMI.

  I bought this for my MacBook Pro since I needed something with SD capability and was tired of carrying multiple, overpriced apple dongles around. This thing works great! It’s lightweight and includes a small carrying pouch. I’ve used every port on it simultaneously with zero issue. I’ll buy another when my wife finally upgraded her old max to the new usb-c version.

  I ordered quite a few hubs for my new Chromecast with Google TV and none worked, so I figured I would give this one a try. It worked flawlessly. I Just plug the Chromecasts existing power adapter, the chromecast into the usb type C, and the ethernet cable in the back.The first thing I noticed upon opening is the presentation. Its neatly packaged, and comes with a nice carry case. Its also got a smooth matte finish.

  This item is not bad, but it is not great. I picked it up to add an extra display, have an SD card slot and run my cameras tethered via USB. It does the trick but it can be sensitive at times. This is especially the case when using on the field. It will freeze up my computer/application using the USB port if it gets jostled too much. This works perfectly fine as a docking unit. I do like the build and feel of it otherwise. I am surprised it self powers despite the low wattage that the Macbook Air M1 puts out.

  I bought this to reduce the number of connections to my laptop with the power cord, Ethernet and HDMI.  But my laptop complains when it's powered by the hub that it is only getting 34 W with the 45 W supply.  The description claims 100W pass through charging, but maybe that only works if I use a higher wattage charger and not the one that came with my laptop?  They need to clearly state how much wattage drop there is for pass through charging.  Sad.

  Works great with Samsung S20+ for Dex HDMI output while still using USB mouse/keyboard/controller. Passthru charging also works with Samsung's included charger, though it will charger slower. Super Fast Charging enabled results in Fast Charging according to the phone.Hub itself is fairly light plastic, and has a matte finish and slightly textured top. Doesn't have a cheap plastic feel, and it won't show fingerprints/micro-scratches. There is some give/creeking if you apply pressure, but it feels more than sturdy enough to put in a backpack or laptop bag. Included pouch is a nice bonus to help protect the plastic and stow the cable.

  This seemed like a great way to add functionality to my Chromebook (which only had two USB-C slots and one Micro SD slot) and it really delivered.

  Got my first macbook and was worried about how I am going to use my external keyboard, mouse and second screen at the same time for my projects. My friends who own macbook used to tell me none of their multiports adapters work that well with macbook. I was also skeptical about this adapter’s performance before I received it, it turns out to be very effective adapters with capacity to handle multiple loads. It can handles very easy data flow when I work on heavy projects to transmit it to second screen back and froth along with other plugged in devices such as pendeive, external mouse, keyboard, and my phone to run the app that I  am working on.

  The product worked good for everything but the HDMI Port. I am a University Student and I bought this hub for my Pixel Slate running Chrome OS to add a second display as well as ethernet. I liked that it has sd and micro slots as well as 3 USB ports all worked great. The problem was the HDMI display would flicker on and off and glitch excessively. I have a smaller usb-c hub that does the same thing (minus ethernet and the abundance of usb ports) and doesn't ever give me issues with the second display so I'm a little disappointed Aukey's is giving me this issue since generally their stuff works pretty well. Maybe it will run better on Windows or MacOS.

    Works with a gaming laptop with usb-c to dock, dock hdmi to monitor
  
",5.0,Clay Porter,"Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have a laptop that has USB-C out.  I have a monitor, a USB keyboard and a USB mouse that I hoped I could connect to with a single connection. I'm absolutely thrilled to find that this device works.  I get 2560x1440 @ 165hz on the monitor, and I don't even need to have external power to the hub/dock device. I am just hooking my laptop to the dock via USB C, and the dock goes to my monitor via HDMI.  Mouse and keyboard work just fine also.I did not try to extend the laptop screen because my laptop screen does 120hz and I didn't want to limit the monitor.  I just used it closed-lid hooked into the dock device.A full featured dock would have the ability to use an external power source to provide power to my laptop so that I have a single connection, but I looked at the price tag on those and I am perfectly happy using the laptop's own power brick.I also have an iPad Pro that I wanted to see if I could dock, and surprise, it works - but the limitations of the iPad OS make it sort of clunky.  The mouse wheel must be used the traditional Mac direction, which is not my preference; it can't be switched in settings like you can on a Mac. Also, the video aspect ratio doesn't adjust to the aspect/resolution of the monitor.  If has the black-bar sides, except when you are consuming video that has a different resolution like 1920x1080.  Also, a mouse pointer+ button doesn't ""work"" like the capacitive touch sensitivity of the iPad screen.  This device would be just great to dock a MacBook Pro or Air, but it isn't quite there with the iPad because of the OS.For the price, it fits my purpose perfectly for less than I expected to spend.  I definitely recommend this device if your usage scenario is anything like mine.

  When I started researching on what MacBook I wanted to buy, I knew I would have to find a thunderbolt HUB to use all my existing devices (External Hard drive, camera, monitor). While there are many options available, I was more or less inclined towards the one which attach to the macbook. But at the same time I didnt liked the idea of having a hub always attached to my macbook. When I saw this product, I liked it as this is a slim multi-port, yet it has all the input options I was looking for. I like that it doesn’t plug right up against my laptop but instead has a flexible cord to distance it a little to avoid rubbing/scratching my MacBook. I have used this for connected USB devices and HDMI ports so far and it has worked every time without issue. Reasonably priced. I have used Aukey products earlier, so I knew these were of good quality. I am happy with this purchase

With that said I have used this product for the past few months and my biggest gripe is the connection for the HDMI cable, I thought it was the connection to the monitor but after testing out a few things I found the connection to the hub is very poor. If you move the hub while connected to a monitor it will black out or become fuzzy.

  There's not much to write home about with the IO, they all work. However, I am by no means stress testing this hub.

It's nice to just be able to plug in this hub rather than those 5 aforementioned items independently. While the build isn't metal, as the pictures might have you believe, the plastic isn't super cheap, and it won't catch all your fingerprints, The rubber feet on the bottom make it great to just leave on your desk, as it won't be sliding around.All in all, for me, I don't need all the options offered by a USB C laptop hub, and this little guy does the trick while remaining portable, light, and cheaper.Finally, it's nice that this can also be used with your phone.

   This is my third Aukey product. I trust this brand and that is one reason I opted for this product compared to other products available in market for cheaper price.The product is very sleek, very easy for transportation, won't occupy much space in your bags.Its like a size of a mouse. Great for people who carry laptops in small bags. The cable is not very long too, fits in your pocket very easily.Can be attached to your laptop using a velcro.the Matte finishing is great, scratches won't be visible not very heavy.Cons:Comes with a cheap carrying case, would never use that bag. Also, felt the price is bit high compared to other products in amazon. Wish they had one more Type C output.Highly recommend this product for anyone who would want to carry a hub with themselves alway. Recommend this product.

    Best small usb-c hub

  This is the best small usb-c hub I found with every port I was looking for: HDMI, Ethernet, usb-a (2 usb 3.0 and 1 usb), SD card reader and a usb-c input for charging.Now I only need to plug one usb-c cable to my laptop to have all my peripherals connected (power, keyboard, screen, webcam, wired internet) and can easily switch between work and private laptop.The hub even comes with a nice pouch for travelling. This is a nice touch. I have never been disappointed with Aukey products and this hub is in line with the other products I have from them.

  Update - after posting my issues on this review, customer service reached out to me and sent me a new hub after a few email exchanges. New one received works great. Awesome customer service.Really like the overall build and design but that’s where it stops for me on the positives for my experience with this. I have a handful of Aukey products that I use and have been a fan for a long time. This hub however was nothing but headaches.- Display out on my Mac was stuck at 50hz on my 2K display even when it read as HDMI 2.0- PD claiming to be 100W only output 45W and had only one usb device connected. Tried this on my Mac and Windows laptop- ran extremely hot- display would also flickerI didn’t have these issues in my Apple Display adapter or another hub that I have. Thinking I have gotten a defect and hope this isn’t a common issue with this product.

It is sleek, mobility is convenient with its in package pouch that you can see in pictures. very convenient to carry this around in my laptop carrying case and bag. This had all the ports on offer that a modern-day executive needs with their laptops that only come with USB-C ports. It has high-speed LAN input/output, USB-A ports, HDMI, and SD card slots.

    Thunderbolt 3 and 100W PD compatible it seems!
  
",5.0,Michael Alexander,"Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  A great little product, I use it with a high quality Thunderbolt 3 compatible 6 ft USB extension cable to provide power and high speed wired ethernet to my laptop all in one connection. My GbE cable from my router reports this is a GbE device, and my 90W PD USB C charger works to provide power for this device and my laptop the hub is plugged into. I was also able to add the wireless keyboard and mouse USB A dongles to this and use everything at once over the 6 ft extension cable without issue.Be warned, Thunderbolt 3  has an absolute cable distance limit of 6ft, and requires high enough quality devices and cables that it can even go that distance. That's why I was surprised this product was able to do it at this price point. If you try to stretch the cables longer, you'll get noticeable worse data speeds. Power Delivery (PD) also requires compatible devices to pass thru high power from a wall charger to a laptop, and his enough cable quality to handle up to 100W. This device does it without issue, all the way up to the maximum 100W, which is also unusual for devices at this price point.

  Bought this as my previous usb-c adapter didn't have sd card slot. First off, I like Aukey products and think that in general, they're as good if not better than Anker. I own two of Aukey's dashcams and they are much better (in terms of user friendliness and design) than the Anker/Roav equivalent I had.For this adapter, I've used the microSD slot, USB ports and even a power pass through usb-c. I did not test ethernet as I don't have a reason to yet. Overall I'm happy with the performance of the usb-c adapter and I've no issues. HDMI works as expected (though I'm only using a 1080p monitor). The USB ports and MicroSD slots work as as expected, didn't notice any performance difference but I didn't really test either. The power pass through works great! My girlfriend has a Macbook and just used her 60w power adapter and plugged into this adapter and now we use this hub as a docking station. We just plug this adapter in and we get power, our wireless keyboards and am connected to a monitor. Super easy and nice. If there was an option to add a longer usb-c cable, that would really make it great as a docking station replacement. I will say I noticed it runs pretty hot especially if power is plugged in too but so far there's been no issues and am happy with it as is.

  Plugged the Aukey hub into my XPS, and then plugged in the power adapter that came with my laptop (45W), and got a warning about low power charger. Kinda bummed but not a deal breaker I suppose. I have 2 USB-C ports. So I just plugged the charger directly to my laptop. The hub works fine passively. Was able to connect to my monitor with HDMI. USB ports work. Haven't tried the SD card slots or ethernet jack yet. Maybe later if I can find a higher wattage charger, I'll try again. But overall, it's a nice hub.

  This is a great alternative to a dock stations.  Great portable device.  I was able to connect a 2K monitor (Pixio PX277h), mouse, keyboard and headset with no problems.  The power delivery works well for these two laptops, so there is only one cable going into the laptop C-Type port at any given time.  I've used this adapter for a number of days, for 8 hours plus a day, with not issues whatsoever.  Highly recommended if you are looking for a portable solution that will work out of the box with most USB devices.  I just wish the C-Type cable on the adapter was a little bit longer.

  This device worked perfectly until it didn't.  By that, I mean that it bricked my new M1 MacBook Pro.  I used this device for a couple weeks without issue when today, I unplugged the power to the Aukey hub and suddenly my M1 bricked.  It absolutely won't turn on.  I spent an hour on the phone with Apple customer support before finding out that I am going to have to return the MacBook for repair/replacement.  They stated that there is the possibility that the hub may have damaged the motherboard. BEWARE!!!!Now, I am sticking with three stars because the product seemed to work well when it worked.  The build quality seems durable.  The connectors seem solid.  However, I do not know if this is an Aukey issue, or an Apple issue.

  Overall it's a good, reliable usb hub and I prefer the rounded style to the other brick looking brands.All ports work including the usb-c port. It does get warm when in use and the power indicator light is unnecessary but standard on most of these hubs.Size wise it's about about the width and height of a credit card, maybe two inches longer, and has the thickness of a pen. The weight is relatively light.If this has all the ports you need then it's a great buy.

  Straight out of the box, I had issues with the ethernet connectivity as others have mentioned.  The connection often cycles off for no reason, and the hub has even shut down our whole home internet network on multiple occasions. Also, the connection speed was *much* slower than other devices connected by ethernet in our home.While I purchased this hub specifically for the ethernet port, I figured I would keep the hub and use it for its other functions. However, yesterday (just two weeks outside of Amazon's return policy), when plugging in an external hard drive, the entire unit kept cycling on and off until I finally disconnected it.  I had the power pass-through connected as well as a monitor.  I am very disappointed with this product.  I purchased a similar hub from Staples that has been working beautifully and receives the higher connection speeds I would expect.I would not recommend purchasing this product!!

",4.0,CAReaderGirl,"Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is a tough review to leave because I feel like this hub will work for 90% of folks without any issues, but in my use case, it had a major failing that makes it unworkable for me.To start, it's small, easy to use, and works well right out of the box for my 2020 Macbook Pro 13in. Some of the slots are a little close together which occasionally required a bit of shuffling around for various plug housing sizes, but that was no big deal.The problem for me is that I  use dictation a lot for writing and, for reasons unknown, dictation DOES NOT WORK work while this hub is plugged into my Macbook.It doesn't matter if I use an external mic (plugged into the hub OR the macbook itself) or the onboard mic. Dictation refused to respond to input until the hub was unplugged. I spent hours troubleshooting online and a half-hour online with apple care but the end result was the same. I could *sorta* get voice control to work, but it would quit at odd moments...only if the hub was plugged in.I have heard that other dictation software advises you not to plug mics into hubs, but in this case, it didn't matter where the mic was plugged in: as long as the hub was plugged into my laptop, dictation failed.Like I said, not a huge deal and probably won't affect most users, but as a writer, I dictate often to save my wrists...and, if I were a person, who relied on accessibility programs this would be a dealbreaker.I tried it for several months but never developed a workaround (short of unplugging it for writing?--thereby disconnecting from monitor and peripherals) so, unfortunately, I won't be using his hub any longer (maybe for travel?)I am eager to see if other hubs have this issue.

  Product appeared to be as described upon arrival. Pretty cheap feeling build for the price tag. Ugreen options were same price with better build quality. But this one had the 4k option, USB-C Passthrough 100 W charging, hdmi in one unit. So I jumped on this. Seller sent generic e-mail making sure everything was received promptly which was nice to see as I haven't seen that before.As title states, three hours in my external usb MyPassport stopped working out of nowhere and then kept connecting and re-connecting rapidly. Thank goodness it didn't fry any sectors it appears . I know these MyPassports don't drain much power because I can run one off of my android phone utilizing otg usb 2.0 protocols with a basic 1A charger brick and it works like a gem and still charges my phone at a decent rate. So something was off. At first I thought it was my Galaxy Book S misbehaving or having driver issues.I tried both USB-C ports on the Galaxy Book. I tried different charger heading to the Galaxy Book AND the USB hub. In total I finally got it to work and recognize a drive that port (switched to flash drive in case it tried to fry my MyPassport again). It finally recognized it again!Lasted 5 minutes. It started shutting down MyPassport again due to lack of power. Then it started setting off the USB port alarm on my Samsung galaxy book. Immediately unplugged the hub. The thing was on fire. I tested the hub on my older dell and now the other usb ports on the hub do the same thing. All fried, over-draining power. I unplugged everything but the Ethernet from the hub. Then then whole hub stops reading anything.It literally used up my entire Galaxy Book battery (LASTS 26 FRREAKING HOURS UNCHARGED).

  My intention for this hub was to use as a Aukey USB-C hub for Samsung Dex feature available on Samsung Galaxy flagship devices, such as the Note9/S9 and higher.The packaging was sturdy, and included a nice sleeve/case for the hub, which would make it easy to toss in a laptop bag or suitcase when traveling. The finish is a matte black, and the I/O ports are on the three sides of the hub, with USB 3.0 Type-A ports and SD cards slots on one side, the Ethernet port opposite the face with the cord, and HDMI, USB-C power delivery port (for charging the docked device) and a single USB 2.0 Type A on the remaining side.In one of the attached pictures, you can see I connected the display, power, network, and wireless USB mouse and keyboard. Once I connected to my Note9, this booted right into Dex. In the photo, you can see with the circled icons in the system tray that the phone was using Ethernet and external keyboard/mouse input supplied by the hub.The hub was sturdy, and my worry was with all the I/O plugged in that connections might be shaky or loose, but everything worked great. I was able to load many Android apps and use them in a windowed mode, just like a desktop PC. The hub did not get hot, even with all the processing it was doing.Overall, this is a greats USB-C hub, and a great value. I own other Aukey devices (chargers, powerbanks, headphones, etc.) and they never seem to disappoint.

  Pros:- Ports-a-plenty.  Fast USB 3.0s, card reader, power throughput, HDMI and ethernet.  Saved me a whole dongle in my kit bag AND this works better than the other two ever did.- Size.  Small and lighter than other hubs.- Finish.  Quality materials mean a good looking and what feels like robust build.  Travel pouch adds a touch of class.- USBC cable.  Small pro, but the designs that have a short cable that plugs into USBC, rather than a straight plug so that it looks like an extension of the device, makes more sense and is more versatile in the situations it can be used in.- Works seamlessly.  Plug all the devices and power into the hub, plug hub into Macbook and they're all there.  Other dongles have required Apollo Mission style sequence of insertions and connections to get everything working, this one doesn't.Cons: (only one)- The activity light on the ethernet port is so bright it could be seen from the moon.  Nothing some tape/marker couldn't fix but when it's in a darkened room it's too distracting.  Normally would take a star off for that but it's easily user fixable so leaving it at 5.

It recommends plugging in the hub to your computer first then plugging the ethernet into the hub which I have done. I find that it still continues to get hot but not all the time. When that happens I unplug it because I don't want my new computer to get ruined. It's small enough to put into my computer case.

  I like it so much I bought 2. I got one for a Dell laptop when my new charging cord arrived and it was a USB-C charger taking away a port. This allows full pass-through charging with no issues and does well with my usb web cam for zoom. Data transfer on USB flash drive is quick. When my wife's apple usb-c dongle for her MacBook stopped working right I got her one too. She uses it for HDMI out to a 34"" monitor, Webcam, laser printer, mouse, and charging. No problems with any connection. I've been very impressed. Its a nice compact size and the cord is just long enough.

  I purchased this to replace my USB-C port replicator that I forgot in my office.  My last replicator was also an Aukey and it was metal where this one is plastic.  It comes well packaged and unlike the metal one this comes with a nice little carrying bag.  Though I haven't been traveling as much I'm sure travel will pick up soon and this will be easier to  carry just because it is a few oz lighter.

  This hub works well to power my MacBook Pro and allow me to use basic USB attachments.  I've used an external hard drive on the USB 3.0 port, the ethernet port, and the HDMI port with no issues.  However, the USB 3.0 ports seem to be a bit under powered if you need to use something that draws a lot of power.  I could not get my external blu-ray disc reader to work until I gave it direct power from another adapter. I don't have that problem with another full sized dock that I have.

  I recently bought a new Mac Book pro that had limited ports. As all the new laptops on the market, you get a powerful device with a sleek design which unfortunately compromises space for ports. The trend is usually having a single USB-C and if you’re lucky, you’ll get another USB-C and USB A.Then you’re stuck with buying an expensive hub that your laptop OEM sells vs. This impressive premium Aukey USB-C hub with 3xUSB 3.0 ports, 4K HDMI port, Ethernet (1 Gbps) and best of all another USB C port for power delivery! To top it off it also includes a regular SD and Micro SD card ports for transferring photos if you're an avid traveler and photographer!What I appreciate about any tech company, is providing to its customers with a travel case to help protect and maintain their product. Aukey provides a soft touch travel pouch included in the packaging.This product has been ideal for my requirements. I need a HDMI connecter because I connect my laptop to different displays whether it’s a monitor, tv or projector for presentations. The three USB-A 3.0 ports allow me to simultaneously copy data at a high speed and to my surprise, the hub doesn’t heat up when copying large data. These ports also fast charged my Smartphone! At the same time I can connect my OEM USB C power adapter to the hub without losing another USB C port on the laptop.I highly recommend this top notch product by Aukey. The Premium 7-in-1 USB-C Hub provides me with all the ports that are essential for my work in one hub.

   I got this thinking that the Aukey brand name was popular and maybe of good quality but guess not. It is advertised as being able to provide 100W USB PD Charging. It cannot do this and I would recommend people to not try to connect their expensive laptops to this to test.I wanted this unit so that I could connect my macbook charger to the USB C PD in, and my USB keyboard and mouse, SD card, and ethernet to this singular hub and just have the hub USB C input to my Macbook. This way I could just come back home and connect my macbook to the hub and have a one-cable solution! But the device gets extremely hot and cannot charge over USB C. It starts to charge and then disconnects charging every few seconds (can be seen doing it once in the video). After a couple days, charging stopped completely. I have tried a variety of different chargers and with another laptop too (HP Spectre x360) to no avail.I talked to Amazon and got a replacement. The replacement had the exact same issue.Bottomline: Everything other than charging the laptop works on this hub. So if you are not looking to charge your laptop thru the hub, you should be fine. In that case, you should be able to find cheaper docks that dont have the circuitry. If you want to charge your 16 inch MacBook, this does not work.EDIT: The company has refunded me.

  I travel a lot and live a life on the road half of the time each year. This product is going to be a life saver! The product comes in a nicely packaged cardboard muji-vibe box and contains an instruction booklet and a fabric sleeve.The usb hub charges a lot faster than I thought and distributes it evenly among different devices. Once you plug this into your laptop, you can connect up to three other devices using the hub’s usb, another via hdmi for screens. In addition, there’s an Ethernet port for hotels that have extremely slow WiFi (we all know which brands of hotels those are eh), and two for SD cards.I will mainly be using these to charge my laptop at the same time with my phone, tablet, GoPro, and backup batteries. When you’re traveling in countries like Europe, some hotels have limited outlets. And if you’re staying at hostels, you might just have one that is available. Having this will allow you to charge everything overnight at once so that you’ll have all the juice needed for the next day. Especially if you’re doing cross country backpacking or business trips that limits your down time to do these things.

  It basically does what it says it does.

The pass through power aspect works, tho I opted for a direct connection w/ a mag-power adapter like the old MacBook Pros had. Highly recommend that.

  I travel a lot with a single backpack, so I'm careful to buy equipment that can serve multiple purposes while being lightweight. When I recently switched to a 2020 Macbook Air, I was looking for a USB-C hub that would give me the ports I needed while adding minimal weight.I bought this Aukey hub along with an Anker 7-in-1 USB-C hub. Both do the job well and are almost identical in dimensions, though the Aukey is a bit smaller in overall volume as its body is more curved. More importantly, while the Anker weights in at 4.4oz, the Aukey is only 2.3oz. In hand, the weight difference is palpable, making the Aukey a better travel companion for me.

  I used to have the style hub where it plugs directly into the side of the computer into both USB-C ports. The main problem I had with that is that when you try to unplug anything, you wind up pulling out the whole device disconnecting anything else attached to it.This is a much more elegant solution. The ethernet port is nice to have even though I don't use it. There are two things I appreciate about this adapter - the inclusion of a USB 2.0 port and a PC HDMI connection. For those that don't know, the Logitech Unifying receiver has some intermittent issues when connected to a USB 3 port that can cause intermittent disconnecting. I have an MX Master 2S and ever since switching to this adapter I haven't had a single problem with disconnects.When I connect my display it's recognized as an actual monitor and not a generic HDMI source. The difference here is that under macOS you get access to proper scaling options, and not just 1080p or 720p resolutions. Unfortunately, it doesn't support 144hz, but I think for most people that won't matter. I don't use my MacBook for gaming, so it doesn't really bother me either.The included carrying case is a nice little bonus and will be a permanent part of my travel gear.

  I bought this for my Dell Vostro 7500 and all functions work properly including PD charging through the usb C back into the laptop.

The HDMI connected to my monitor with no issues either. With new laptops providing less ports this is a great option at a great price point. I paired it with an Aukey 100W PD wall charger that currently shows as a 60W charger but that may be because of the cord I'm currently using. A new 100W cord should arrive today and after I test it's function I'll do a review of the charger which is much smaller than the Dell 130W which is admittedly faster charging when at home. I am very happy with both units and highly recommend them.

I use 2 different USB-C hubs (not daisy-chained, separate USB-C ports) to facilitate a dual-monitor setup on my Macbook Pro.

This device allows me to bring just a lightweight keyboard to a hotel and leave the laptop behind when I can't pack a laptop.

  The hub is compact and lightweight with all the connectivity I need. (The only thing that maybe would have been nice would be an audio output, but that is a very minor point). It is an excellent hub that actually powers my 2019 15"" MacBook Pro  at the full capacity needed (my machine is used for lots of heavy code compilation and 4K video editing tasks) . Beware that a lot of other hubs can only provide 60W which would be not enough. It is great to travel with, but also works well when using on a full-time basis at home or in the office. This very affordable hub did allow me to not have to buy one of those $200 or $300 high end hubs.I just need to give a shout out to the great customer service at AUKEY. The only problem I had with it, or so I thought at first, was that my monitor would not go to 4K resolution when connected through the hub. I tried a different monitor, different cables, etc. but the only common factor was that when connected through the hub my Mac would not recognize the monitor as 4K. I contacted AUKEY customer service, who promptly replied and verified I had tried all practical things to resolve the issue, and then immediately send me a replacement. When that one arrived I still had the same problem and, since I could not imagine that a good company like AUKEY would have 2 bad items in a row, I started digging deeper. Turns out that somewhere in some OS upgrade a bug crept in where it would not recognize LG monitors when connected through a hub (any hub, not just AUKEY). So the problem was not on AUKEY's side. The solution was actually simple, by using a free app named ""Display Menu"" in the App Store , which allows you to set the monitor to 4K regardless of what Preferences on the Mac tells you. And now try monitor works great at 4K through the hub. I assume in the future LG or Apple will fix this without the need for this.

  The Aukey USB C hub is honestly really amazing and is a life changer for me since I own a laptop that doesn't come with an Ethernet port and having one with multiple USB A ports, USB C PD passthrough port, an HDMI for multiple monitors, and an SD card reader that can read microSD cards without the need of an adapter is simplely amazing. It can do everything that I want it to do and it really expands the capability of my laptop now that I can connect an Ethernet cable onto my hub which can allow me to game without any latency (important for ALVR which is wireless VR streaming to my Oculus Quest 2). Since I'm going to college soon, this will definitely come with me and to compliment the USB C Hub, they included a pouch to store the hub which is pretty dandy, especially since that the usb c jack won't scratch my stuff inside my bag. Overall, I heavily recommend the USB C Hub.

    Missing Carrying Pouch? Many other small caveats as well.

  I got this hub because I needed an ethernet adapter for my new 16"" MacBook Pro and because I like AUKEY's other products. I feel like they dropped the ball on this one:Pros- Build quality seems nice- Lots of ports for other peripheralsCons- Their manual has a lot of caveats to what you can plug in, such as:- Only one external hard drive can be connected to this hub- When using the USB 3.1 ports, you can't plug in anything that requires more than 900mA of power (I wanted to plug in my wireless charging pad with it, but it causes the hub to regularly disconnect with have the Mac say ""USB Accessories Disabled"". That said, I guess you shouldn't be using this for charging other devices, but rather just data transfer, so it's not really the worst con.)- The USB 3.1 ports may also interfere with 2.4GHz wireless devices (e.g. wireless mice and keyboards), so it asks you to plug those in somewhere else. Fortunately, my mouse uses 500Hz, and it seems to work fine for now.- The SD and MicroSD card slots CAN'T be used simultaneously! That said, I doubt there will be many times I would do such a thing, so again, not really the worst con I guess.- Be sure to connect the pass-through USB-C charging first before connecting your USB 3.1 devices since they may require the extra power. I use the 96W MacBook Pro power adapter my laptop came with and it seems to work fine.- The hub heats up a fair bit, but I feel like almost all hubs also heat up, so I think it's fine. It's not like unbearably hot or anything.- Lastly, my carrying pouch doesn't seem to have come with my product. (AUKEY, if you see this, please send me one!)Overall, I'm a little disappointed with how many little caveats there are with this hub. I suppose most are understandable, but I also thought everything would ""just work,"" which has been my experience with other AUKEY devices. Hope this helps some other people.Update: ended up returning since they didn't respond to my feedback.

    Necessary Peripheral

  I got this USB Hub for my new Macbook Pro, and it works flawlessly. Uploading photos from a micro SD and the ability to have a hardwired ethernet connection are crucial to my workflow. Only having one external monitor works for me, but the single HDMI output may be a hindrance for others needing more external monitors.

  This little Aukey guy is perfect and a necessity for the newer Macbooks. It is sleek and all the hubs work great and instantaneous. It even comes with a very cool sticker to personalize your look. Highly recommend and picked this one out from looking at a couple different options. I also recommend using this kind of hub that dongles and not one that fully attaches on the side as you will not be able to use those with a case. Once again can’t go wrong with this! Great product :)

  I love this hub. Bought two, one for my 2020 13” Mac Book Pro so I can extend my desktop while working from home. The other one for my son’s computer for online schooling. We got so many Wi-Fi broadcasting in our area and so I can use the hubs ethernet for peace of mind.

  Addendum:  ""... research published on StackExchange claims that putting the charger in on the left-hand side alongside other peripherals causes spikes in the laptop’s temperature."" Using mine on right-side only, just in case.Original Review:I recently purchased a 16"" MacBook Pro i7, 512 SSD, 16 GB RAM.  After much consideration, I choose the following accessories:1. USB C Charger, RAVPower 61W USB Wall Charger2. Anker Powerline II USB C to USB C 2.0 Cable (6ft)3. Aukey Link PPD Pro USB C Hub 8 in 14. VicTsing Pioneer Bluetooth Wireless Mouse5. UPPERCASE GhostBlanket Screen Keyboard Imprint Protection Microfiber LinerIt was important to me to use reliable, safe products on this expensive technology. The hub works great and locks into the port securely.  I can move the computer without having to worry if the hub will separate. I am particularly surprised at how small and light the hub is.  It also serves as a convenient handwarmer.  I keep a 256 GB Samsung microSD flashcard in it to function as TimeMachine (set to backup only twice a week). Granted I would have liked this hub to look like a scorpion and have led lights on it but it's so much more professional this way.

    Minimal USB C Hub for travelers

  After jumping the bandwagon from Windows to Mac and getting on USB-C train, all I had to primarily invest in was USB-C/Thunderbolt compatible monitor. Now, my monitor acts as my primary docking hub, but TBH I am a minimal user, my Keyboard and Mouse are Wireless, and if needed are plugged into my monitor, and MacBook is charged via thunderbolt current from the monitor.I bought this docking hub for in-case specifically when traveling or at work, to convert between USB-C and HDMI and also enable plugging of other USB-A/B ports.Where this hub falls short is that, it doesn't have USB-C port or support for multiple monitor, but I guess you don't really need that if your needs are ""minimal hub for travelers"". I have primarily used this to setup and pair my laser printers, card reader for GoPro, etc.
