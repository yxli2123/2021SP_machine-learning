    PS4 is a great leap forward in the next generation consoles
  
",5.0,Porfie,"Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2013","









  
  
    
  Really enjoying the PS4 so far. I think my biggest gripe are the lack of good games available for it at launch. I have been playing the free games with my Playstation plus 30 day trial. System is nice and small and quite compared to my PS3. A few gripes I have is the lack of CD playback, MP3 support and DLNA support. I know those will be coming soon so I'm not stressing about it quite yet. I will rate it FIVE stars once those features are added. Once games like the new Uncharte and a few other ones come out for it, then we will appreciate our purchase more. In the meantime I am just enjoying it more as a blu-ray player and streaming device till the content is there. I also believe with updates down the road this will improve the way the PS3 did back in the day.One more side note. If when your watching a blu-ray and you try and get the DTS-HD Master Audio and or True -HD audio to light up on your receiver, you have to change that setting when your in the movie by hitting the options button on the remote and going to audio settings. Why Sony didn't include this in the settings menu is beyond me.

  Ok, so Xbox fanboys will have a much different opinion, but this console is amazing. Graphics and speed are amazing. A boatload of games, and  Sony Is now previewing a cloud based gaming service that will allow you to stream PS3 games directly to this console. I am  in beta and it already works great... This is gonna be a game changer. This is the console gaming rig to have, no question about it.

  Works great I have had since initial release and this is a second one I purchased for a vacation home. Games look great. Wireless speeds not great though. I have in the same room as the router and i get maybe 25 or 30 meg. when I hard wire in I get over 50 and my broadband is 150. I like the party chat with my friends even if we are playing different games helps us stay in touch. Graphics for the games I have are excellent. I used to be an xbox guy but the PS3 converted me.

  Love it. I wish it was backward compatible though. When getting rid of my PlayStation 3, I had to also give away many of the ps3 games. But overall this is a good upgrade. Other non-game features such as Netflix and Amazon are good too. I didn't try Spotify as I already subscribe to Google music. I waited more than three years for the price to drop before purchasing.

  The new PS4 is great. No complaints so far. The controllers are a great new design.The games have been slow in coming, but I'm assuming thats because its a new platform.From what I have seen, if you're looking for next gen console then this is you're only choice.The free games online are cool as well.The xbox one is a bad joke with its poor design.

  Ps4 has a lack of games at the moment, but they are on the way. I received my Ps4 on launch day and have had no problems so far. The UI was a little problematic at first, but updates have helped a lot.  Call of Duty, Battlefield and 99% of all other EA software I will not buy. I like to spend my money on things that I fill have some kind of quality. With that being said I got Killzone. Campaign is dull and boring compared to Killzone 2 and 3, but it does look very very good on the screen. Multiplayer is exceptional and if you liked other Killzone games you'll probably like the multiplayer more than the campaign. Just my opinion.  The controller is better, BUT!!! The battery life is only about 6 hours, so have a spare controller ready if you intend on playing for any length of time.

  My PS3 only lasted about a year, so I was a little hesitant how long this unit would last.  I've had this for over a year and a half with no problems and I have got a lot of hours of use out of it.  The brand has been able to keep up with new and changing innovation and it has swayed me from my former brand loyalty.  You don't even need to be a gamer to get use out of this machine.  It will play blu-ray and dvd, and you can use it for streaming apps.  I really like that because I don't have to switch out a bunch of devices between limited HDMI ports on my TV.  I've also used it with my projector.

  The Ps4 is Awesome! I have both systems and they are worth it! Yes there is bitter reviews,  but really 1 star? Faulty products do happen so don't let that be the reason not to buy it. Amazon will take care of you if something like that was to occur. So now onto the product. This system definitely pushed the bar beyond what i thought next gen was going! The UI is fast and simple, and the setup is easy. Yes there is some minor faults like connecting surround sound. (need an optical cord) and doesn't use old TB headsets (as of now) and 3d support, But like i said those are minor.  Make sure you get playstation plus for the free games and to play online.Yes they have a online membership like xbox but the difference is $10 cheaper and they give free games with it or discounted.  Yes there is limited titles out right now but there will be a-lot of them coming! As for over paying for the system don't! Just get on the waiting list or get sent a reminder when they are available.

    Excellent Entertainment System - Will Get Better Once More Games Are Out
  
",5.0,Knight Ducharme,"Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2014","









  
  
    
  The user interface takes a little bit of getting used to, but seems to be relatively simple and ad-free compared to that of the Xbox One. The ability to put apps (i.e. Netflix or Amazon Prime) on hold to open another app or navigate through the menus is great.The controller is great, though I do miss the ""start"" button. The touch pad works well in game play and doesn't feel gimmicky. The recent system update allowing users to dim the light bar on the controller has helped extend the decent battery life.I highly recommend purchasing with a PlaysStation Plus subscription, as the free games every month are a nice addition. The free games for the PlayStation 4 are nowhere near as good as the options that have been coming out for the PlayStation 3, however.

  After a couple years, it has mainly just sat on the shelf. I recently read that they are now coming out with a ps4.5 which implies having upgraded hardware. It's disappointing that as a customer who bought this in the first month for the highest price isn't given anything for being a committed fan of playstation and sony products.

  Fantastic next-gen console.  I wasn't expecting a significant increase in graphics performance but I can say I was pleasantly surprised when comparing Ghosts on the PS3 to the PS4.  Much sharper, crisper graphics and colors are beautiful.  Big difference. The unit itself is beautiful - I like the sharp edges and matte black and glossy black exterior.  The light bar in the center is a nice touch, too, as long as it isn't blinking blue!  For what it's worth - I know it SUCKS for the fraction of customers that experienced the bad systems...  Just try to be patient.  Sony (or Amazon) will make it right.  I was one of the unlucky folks that had the cooling issues with the PS3 and Sony definitely took care of me.Controller is a major upgrade too.  Feels bigger and the buttons are spaced out a bit more it feels like.  Good for people with Yeti-hands like me!  Triggers are a major upgrade and I like the touchpad in the center.  Looking forward to more uses in the future.Downloaded Contrast last night, too, and would strongly recommend.  Great game and very challenging.So far so good with the console!  PS4 for the WIN!

  The PS4 exceeded all of my expectations. Great graphics, beautiful gameplay, and a sleek appearance. While the games available in store now are slim, the online games available make up for it. Free to plays like Warframe for instance are great. The only negative that I have noticed is that the new controllers seem to have a shorter battery life than the old models.

",5.0,DryvBy,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2014","









  
  
    
  Just a quick review since everyone else has said what needs to be said.Pros:-Fastest console on the market. Don't be fooled by the other guys. GDDR3 vs GDDR5 memory is no competition. GDDR3 is something modern mid-line PCs don't even use anymore.-Nice looking system. Really looks amazing in person.-PS+, while i don't like it being required to play my games online, is an amazing service and only adds to it's quality with the addition of the PS3/Vita. So much free. So many discounts.-Twitch.tv and Ustream services are easily accessed at a click of a button. Screen shots and video uploads (currently, only to Facebook).-Quiet. Nice and quiet. Killzone cranked up a fan a few times but it was still quiet.Cons:-Controller has a chance of being a dud. At least originally. I have 2 controllers and one of mine sticks all the time. Several forums on the internet have information on this. Sony will replace a busted controller though.-Controller light bar. It's bright. And there's no option to turn it off without modding your controller.-UI is bare right now. No themes. Just blue screen.-Missing a media player and DNLA support. This should be patched back in via firmware.-Included mic sucks. Buy a real mic.

    Good console + Sound issues
  
",3.0,Alex & Grecia,"Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2014","









  
  
    
  I love the console but it has sound issues (No 5.1 surround sound when playing Blu ray movies or streaming services, only stereo)After trying everything and contacting Sony's support team, I got to the conclusion that the PS4 has huge software issues that must be patch really soon. Searching online you'll see all the Sound problems this console has.I returned my PS4 and I probably get another one when this issue get fixed. However, after 4 months from its released and 400$, you might expect something really different from a console that is supposed to be state of the art tech.

  I was really skeptical about purchasing the PS4 in November, and I'm guess I'm glad I waited until February. It looks like a decent amount of people had issues with their PS4's, and that's a shame. But, I guess time and lessons learned has paid off for Sony. The one that was shipped out to me has worked FLAWLESSLY. Here's a quick breakdown:PROS:- The new XMB OS is amazing and lightyears beyond the PS3 XMB.- Online play is more stable and faster than PS3. Looks like Sony can afford better servers now with PS+ :)- Graphics are out of this world. On par with PC graphics at this time.- Dualshock 4 is comfortable, easy to use, and the best the PlayStation has ever had. It's still not as good as the Xbox 360 controller, but it's only off by a hair. The speaker on the controller is a welcome addition, as is the touchpad.CONS:- Not a lot of games out right now.- Was promised controller charging on off mode, but it's only when the PS4 is on standby mode. A small letdown.All in all I recommend getting one now that is seems Sony has worked out the kinks of the launch day ones.

  Ps4 is a great system but it's not a must buy yet. There are great games to play but you can play them on the ps3 also, except for infamous second son. The system looks great, runs smooth, and it's very quiet. The controller feels much better in the hand, than previous PlayStation controllers. The light on the controller gets annoying after a while because it reflects Light on the screen, there is no way to turn the light off at the moment, maybe with an update that will become an option. I been playing MGSV, that runs super smooth and using the companion app works well together. Great system, not enough games, I still play my ps3 more than the ps4.

  I have been a fan of Sony products for some time now. I have tried Xbox and Microsoft products but have never really found them to be reliable or user friendly. The new PS4 is quite amazing. The ease of access to content and menus is a plus. And the ability to swap out hard drives and upgrade your system was a major selling point.  I'm sure both systems have advantages and disadvantages, but for me , I am glad I purchased the PS4. It's. $100 cheaper and easy to use. The games are great. Most come in 1080p and most upcoming ones will as well.  Overall I have enjoyed owning the new system these past few months.

  I love it. It's quick and elegant. The design is very modern, and the interface was easy to use.The only problem that I was that it took a long time to update. There was no problem with the actual console, The problem was that the Playstation Network was offline probably due to high traffic. I tried again after a few hours, and my PS4 updated within 1 minute.I installed a disc game (Assassin's Creed 4) within 1 minute or 2. Very fast.Other than the PSN being offline (which is not a problem for PS4 but of Sony), the PS4 is great.

    Sony listened, but did it deliver?
  
",4.0,DC,"Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2013","









  
  
    
  Like corporations that sincerely care about their consumers, Sony has done a stunning job with their Playstation 4 by learning from their mistakes and listening to their target audience (gamers). By doing thorough research on next-generation consoles, I now personally find Sony's intentions of making an amazing machine to be honest at heart. Apps like Netflix and Amazon prime work flawlessly and can be used with or without a Playstation PLUS membership (which, with free games and discounts is a great deal itself). Without a doubt I'd give the PS4 5 stars, but nothing is perfect. My only minor complain is the interface, which could use a bit of work. It's a tad cluttered into one section while the others are hardly ever touched. The system itself thought is incredibly powerful, and it is clear that they did all they could to make it so for its affordable price. Its design is beautiful, light, thin, and black throughout. It wobbles a bit when placed horizontally but trust me when I say this insignificant ""flaw"" (for lack of a better term) will not bother you. The controller is comfortable and intuitive and the games, though limited at launch, are stunningly beautiful in native 1080p and are only going to get better. Sony definitely delivered.

  I've only had the PS4 a few weeks, but so far my wife enjoys it.I'm disappointed that local streaming isn't available, but I have other devices for that.I have my unit on an Uninterupable Power Supply, and keep the PS4 on Stand-by pretty much all of the time, and have had no issues with the automatic downloading of Patches, or Pushed Downloads.I have not had issues with noise or overheating, either. I was concerned about that, but so far so good.I really am a bit happy that we are able to Multi-task, it's something that should have been on the PS3, but hey, whatever.I'm not going to talk about what games are available. That's a waste of time.It's pretty heavy, we've been taught to associate that with build quality, if the weight is really indicative as such then I would say it's a solid piece of equipment.The graphics are fairly nice and if you're not interested in buying a Gaming  PC or just want a console , I would recommend this one.In closing I would like to suggest you take the time to research as best as you can, before you buy. It's pretty likely that you know someone that has a Playstation console of any variation, and most people have had the chance to play one. I think that if you are buying a console for gaming then you should be comfortable with the way the controller feels in your hand. Speaking of the controller, the battery life is fairly good for everything that is built into it now.Okay I'll stop rambling now.

  Got it all set up and updated within 30 mins. Downloaded 3 digital games one sitting at 43 GB ( I think ) was playing it within 2 hours of initial update. No problems with anything so far, runs nice and quiet.Edit: After almost a year of using it I still thing it works great! I don't play it has much as my Xbox because really I bought this for one game. But have bought many great games for this system. I have noticed playing bloodborne that it tends to get a bit hot. The fan is continuously blowing trying to cool it off. I haven't noticed this with other games, but like I said I don't play it often. I just started to get back into Bloodborne and noticed that the fan is working extra hard to cool it. This would be after 2-3 hours of game play. This might be normal, but I have all sides open, nothing blocking the intake or outtake vents.One thing that does annoy me a lot is the R2 and L2 triggers. I can set my controller down and the slightest bump will make them activate. When taking a break I have to now prop it on my TV remote so the triggers are not touching anything, because if i set it down on the couch or end table it will swing my sword or shoot my gun in bloodborne. It is pretty annoying at times!

  This is my first foray into anything PlayStation.  Having played on Xbox and Xbox 360, I was a little afraid to try something new.  Overall I am very impressed with the new console.  One of the big differences is that the battery is built into the console and there's no huge power brick taking up space.  The graphics are spectacular and I can't wait to see programmers reach its full potential.  The standby mode is great when you are gone for a while because it will download all the updates while you are away.  The big fault is that sometimes it's hard to tell if the updates are downloading and/or updating or possibly stuck.  If you are into games and graphics, this console is a perfect fit.  Xbox One spent so much time trying to be everything that I feel they have dropped the ball on games and graphics.

Of course it was frustrating hooking it up on Christmas and not having it work, but I knew I would be able to get it fixed in no time so I called sony and told them the problem and a few days later they sent me a box to mail it back in. The estimated repair and return time was like 2 and 1/2 weeks, but I actually got it 3 days after I sent it. I was unsure if they even fixed it. I figured maybe I was missing some paper work or a service number or something but to my surprise it was fixed and working perfectly. I've been playing it non stop. I'm happy with the graphics and some of the features. I've only played assassins creed so far because most of the games I want to play aren't out yet. But at any rate. I'm happy.

Originally, I thought I had the HDMI issue, but it turned out to be my receiver.I'm using a Denon AVR-1611 Receiver, and I'm using HDMI from the PS4 to my receiver, and HDMI from my receiver to the TV.  At first, I was getting a flashing screen, that would go to from a clear picture to a snowy/staticy screen when I started my PS4 from Standby OR if I turned my TV off, then on, and left the PS4 running while I was away.  When I would turn the TV on and wake the PS4, the screen would blink on and off with the issue I had described above.When I plugged the PS4 directly into my TV, it worked fine w/o any problems, so I was able to determine it was an issue with my receiver.  I was able to change to a different HDMI port on the receiver, and I tweaked some of the input settings in my receiver configuration, and now the PS4 works without any issues at all.I am giving this a rating of 4, because the menu system is very confusing and non-intuitive.  Many of the system settings that were on the PS3 either are in a completely different menu on the PS4, or are absent.  I'm sure in later firmware updates, this will be managed, but for the launch of the system, I wish it would have been a little easier to set up.The graphics on both games that I bought with the system are amazing--it's definitely an enormous upgrade from the PS3.  I can hardly imagine what games will look like in 5 years if the launch titles are already looking this good.  As many other people have said, the controller is really awesome.  I am a fan of the DS3, but the DS4 is much more comfortable, and I really think the improvements add to the usability and feel of the controller.I highly recommend this system to people who are first adopters and like games like Killzone and Super Stardust HD.  If you need a lot of games at launch, you may want to wait until the library expands before you make a purchase, but overall the system is really good.

  Fits perfectly on the pull-out keyboard tray of my desk next to my keyboard. My ps3 wouldn't even fit there. Plus there is no power brick. That's unreal. I wouldn't have anyplace for that huge xbox1 and it's power brick. Looking at these consoles it seems very obvious who worked on theirs longer and harder. It breaths new life into my seldom used vita. I can play my ps4 via the vita through wi fi. Anywhere. You will want to get one if you don't have one. And the second screen playstation app is a great useful feature too. Amazing. The controller is much improved on an already great design. The touch pad is also a big button. Can't wait to see it we'll implemented.  I love the concave analog sticks, no slippage. The live streaming is something I did not think would hold my interest, but it does. I watch the streaming, as well. Whatever question you could think to ask about whatever game, you can pretty much get answers for immediately. Regardless of weather you are a social media fan or not, there is a lot that it offers. The console is super quick and has none of the lagging xmb dashboard hold ups. Comparing trophies, everything. Gameplay is unmatched. I requested two day shipping, It arrived promptly. Amazon shipped it upside down in the box. Not really what you want to see with expensive electronics. I can understand better all the complaints of broken ps4's from amazon. Mines ok though and I don't really care about yours so I'm very happy.

  Very happy with my new console.  I find the new Dualshock 4 controller to be comfortable and responsive, which for me is a huge improvement over the previous generation's Sixaxis and Dualshock 3 controllers.  My system runs quietly and hasn't shown any heating issues after about 12 hours of play throughout the weekend.I tried out the video sharing service with a short clip of Battlefield 4 uploaded to Facebook.  It would be nice to have sound with the video, but as it is the file sizes are small and the upload was super fast.  Editing was as simple as selecting the start and end points from a series of screenshots, and the entire process from hitting the share button, trimming the video, adding a comment, and uploading to Facebook took less than 90 seconds.All in all, I'm very pleased with my purchase and expect to get a lot of enjoyment out of it for years.

  This system so far has been amazing, each feature is unique ranging from the specs of the controller. Simple things like the the headphone jack  that allows you to plug in your own headphones to listen to audio and your friends in chat at the same time all through the controller the light bar producing different colors as you play different games also doubling as a move controller, the touch pad which is a quick solution to slow typing on the consoles and  even the shape and design of the ps4 itself , ive had both the xbox one and ps4 and i can say there both unique in there each way but for now spec wise and design wise ps4 won me over after being a huge xbox 360 fan that says  a lot and i would highly recommend this to anyone looking for an affordable way of getting a great gaming experience instead of blowing thousands of dollars on a pc to achieve max graphics and frame rate potential. This is the console of the future and the true next gen console.

    A definite and obvious upgrade from the PS3
  
",5.0,Peter Faden,"Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2013","









  
  
    
  So far, I've had a stellar experience with the PS4. Maybe I'm just lucky, but I've had none of the launch issues yet. The graphics are clearly superior to the PS3 in every conceivable way. The user interface is not only much easier to navigate, but it also seamlessly transitions from one page to the next. However, every section can be accessed from the same page, rather than have to scroll through categories like you have to on the PS3. I also very much like the fact that you can simply scroll down on the main page to see what your friends are up to when they are logged onto PSN and you can share your activities as well. Another awesome addition is the ability to post screenshots and gameplay videos directly from the PS4 rather than need a program to do so. This is actually a very cool feature. So far, most of the public features can be tied to Facebook and/or Twitter, adding to the convenience of it all. The DS4 is also a definite upgrade from the DS3, but the specifics of that will be covered in a separate review.The PS4 itself is sleek looking. The product page picture is accurate, but when you actually have it sitting in front of you, it's even more impressive. It's both solidly built and attractive.Eject and power buttons on the console arent completely obvious, as they are touch vs actual buttons, and arent large enough to be very noticeable, but once you know where they are, you realize they are actually better that way as they are unobtrusive and unlikely to be accidentally pressed.So far, the only minor issue I've encountered is with the newest update, which I ended up needing to unplug and then replug it in order to get it to restart and accept the update. However, I had the same issue with my PS3, so it was clearly the update itself and not the system.Anyway, if you are a fan of the Playstation brand, you will definitely love the PS4. A definitely and obvious upgrade from the PS3, as well it should be.

    Originally LOUD fan -- is now FIXED :-)
  
",4.0,Gregory T Reid,"Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2015","









  
  
    
  I owned a Playstation 3 for several years before upgrading to this Playstation 4.  One thing that I really DON'T like about the 4 is that the indicator light is on the top (whereas the 3 had it on the front).  I have my Playstation on a very high shelf in a home theater setup, and I simply cannot see the top of it, so am always guessing as to its current power state.The other thing that I really DON'T like is how loud the fan is ... WAY louder than my Playstation 3's, and quite distracting when watching a movie at low volume.UPDATE 01/27/15 regarding the loud fan: I did some searching of some PS4 forums and learned that this is a somewhat common defect. The fan is variable speed, running only as fast as it needs to run in order to keep the CPU and GPU temperatures below a set value.  The temperature is sensed by a thermistor, and on some units the thermistor may have been faulty (reading really HIGH temperatures), thereby incorrectly indicating that the fan needs to run at full speed.  Anyway, I returned the unit to Amazon just barely within my return time limit window.  They sent me a new one pronto (even before the original one was returned ... I used the new box to return the old one), and the new one is completely quiet.  I'm updating my rating from 3 stars to 4.

  The reason for this review is the poor packaging job Amazon did with my PS4. I have been a Amazon Prime member for over 5 years  and spend thousands of dollars on Amazon each year and the way the PS4 was shipped was by far the worst.The box it cam in was way too large and protective air pillows were only use on the side of the box. The PS4 was able to bounce up and down inside the box. One of the corners of the box was pushed in because there was no support on the inside.I got luck and my PS4 is fully functional with no issues whatsoever. Compared to my PS3 the PS4 is a big upgrade in all departments. The System runs much cooler and quieter, the UI is greatly improved and the dual shock 4 is also better than DS3.the only negative I can think of is the lack of blockbuster titles at launch.

    I'm very, very happy with my purchase of the Sony Playstation 4.
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2013","









  
  
    
  Main review here:As I note below, I'm very, very, very happy with the purchase of my Sony PlayStation 4.  I have been greatly enjoying the gaming that I've done on it so far (over the first week since its release).  Understand though, that despite my happiness with the system, there are some areas that need to be and hopefully will be improved in the not so distant future:* Bluetooth support for headsets (third party and/or Sony manufactured)* The release of a media remote control, either third party or Sony's own.  With the lack of support for PS3 peripheral usage, there was no way to use the existing PS3 Blu-ray remote control with the PS4 :-( and < mad smiley! >-- note to above, there is a third party media remote control due to be released at the end of December 2013 that should help in this area, but it adds a slight negative in that in order to use it, you must place a USB dongle into service that will mean losing the use of one of the available USB ports on your PS4* Sony's continued lack of support for IR remote controls.  As with the PS3, Sony insisted on NOT building in InfraRed remote control support, so the use of IR remote controls, especially useful for those with fancy 'universal' remote controls (such as the Harmony series) are left in the cold again.  I would have hoped that Sony learned their lesson about this with the previous generation, but no such luck.* No 3D Blu-ray playback at release of the system.  That should be resolved in the future, but it is yet another reminder that to some extent Sony (and Microsoft, who had the same limitation on their Xbox One platform at release) rushed to put out release date hardware that is not feature complete at the time they put it out on the market.* No MP3 or CD playback at release of the system.  Not that I intended to be using this device for such playback, but some people would and/or did with the PS3 and that is a drawback to the system until it is corrected.* No DLNA support at release of the system.  Yet again, hopefully fixed in the not too distant future, but lacking at release of the system.* The Blu-ray drive is a slot-loading drive that sits in the system in a manner that some might find confusing based on the way the system is assembled.  The drive sits to the left front of the device, partly under the shiny black plastic cover, and partly under the more matte plastic area, with the eject button and power button on the systems lined up over a portion of the drive slot rather than being completely to the left or right of the drive slot as one might expect.  This seems to have been a case of Sony being too smart for their own good in trying to hide or minimize the thought of using the drive.  While the future may be digital distribution of content, the drive in this device is likely to be used over and over again and hiding it shouldn't have taken precedence.  It should have been easy to find, as should have been the power button and eject buttons.* Speaking of which, yeah, the power button and eject buttons are easy to see, yet not so easily identified as to which button does what.  There are markings on the button for power that are there, but awfully small and not so easily seen.  There is no reason anyone should have to consult a cheat sheet or user guide as to what button does what and yet Sony has put the system together in a manner that doesn't really cooperate in that area.* At least initially there seems to be no way within the system configuration to turn off or mute the microphone that is built-in to the PlayStation 4 camera -- except for plugging in a separate headset/microphone that would have to have its own mute button on it.Things that I like about the system:* Less expensive than it's competition, even with the addition of the very nice PlayStation 4 camera (which I do recommend)* The controllers have a nice feel to them.  In the initial release of the last generation of PlayStation (PS3), the original controllers (Sixaxis controllers) were too light for my tastes and just didn't feel that comfortable for my taste.  I really like the feel of the DualShock 4 controllers, and the weight that they have.  I don't want them to be too heavy, but don't want them so light weight that I can't tell that I have one in hand (which was my problem with the Sixaxis controllers for the PS3)* Setup is pretty simple.  'nuff said in that area really.* The new interface is pretty slick and easy to navigate through.Neutral for me, but probably negative for others:* The need to have a PlayStation Network (PSN) membership for many gaming features.  On the PS3 the need to have an active PlayStation Network account (membership, fee based) was minimal.  Not so with the PS4.  Sony has basically copied their competition here and pretty much requires PSN membership which brings a yearly fee with it.  It is (to me, and to many others) worth the fee, but others might complain and so I note that issue here.How are the games?At the time of release, the games are good, but still a bit rough around the edges.  We are obviously at the start of the next generation in console gaming (at the time I'm writing this review).  A few years out we'll be (hopefully) seeing games that truly push the limits of the next-gen hardware, and we'll see the PS4 and Xbox One systems doing things that truly impress us, at least for a few years.  Eventually these/those systems are going to be 'old' and 'long in the tooth' and we'll be pining for the next next-generation to come along, but for now, the games that we're getting, well, they are pretty nice even if they aren't overly impressive.Graphics in some of the release day games are good, mildly impressive, but just not where we all expect they'll wind up being.  It really is a matter of the developers learning how to do things on these new devices.Games I like:  Call of Duty: Ghosts.  First person shooter that looks pretty nice and plays well.  Later we'll look back at that game as being one that seems so crude by comparison to later releases in that franchise. :-p  Knack.  Knack has proven to be a lot more fun than I had expected.  Very Crash Bandicoot-ish.  Easy to play (at least on the 'easy mode' that I prefer for now) and yet still a lot of fun.  Battlefield 4.  An alternative to CoD: Ghosts.  Assassin's Creed.  Beautiful game, looking forward to playing through it completely.  Lego: Marvel Super Heroes.  Just a ton of fun, especially for younger audiences.  Madden 25 is OK for a football/sports game fix, but isn't necessarily something that I'd recommend buying.  It is nice, but it continues to have issues that nag me too much to spend money buying it.End rating: 5 stars.  Note that I might also give the Xbox One 5 stars if I were rating it, but I'd be doing so more from my love of the systems as I expect them to be, rather than as they are right now.  Neither are perfect, both will eventually improve, and both should continue to push the other to be better for all of us to enjoy.History lesson follows:I'm very, very happy with my purchase of the Sony Playstation 4, though I must admit that when I made the pre-order I was really not sure that I'd be able to come back and say that.Let me start by saying that in the previous generation, I was very much a fan of the Playstation 4's main competition, the Xbox 360  I liked the Xbox 360 an awful lot.  To the point of 'when you can pry it from my cold dead hands'.  Despite multiple issues along the way, mostly the notorious red-ring-of-death that was experienced by most early adopters of the Xbox 360, I still very much loved that system.  Why?  Xbox Live primarily.  It was head and shoulders above anything that anyone else could offer.  The ability to quickly and easily socialize with other gamers that you were playing with or against took console video gaming to the next level.  In FPS (first-person-shooters) this was great because you could plan team maneuvers in the games, while in more social (arcade type) games you could sit and socialize with old friends or new that you happen to make from your travels (as an example, I wound up making several friends by sitting and playing the Xbox Live Arcade version of Uno for many thousands of games).I owned a PS3, a couple of them in fact, but I really only ever used them as media players.  Blu-ray players primarily.  Gaming on them just didn't feel as comfortable to me.  My friends were gaming on Xbox Live, and I wanted to be there with them.  The games seemed nicer/better on the Xbox 360 (though normally it would be a draw as to which system had the better version of any one game).  The whole experience just seemed nicer on the 360, so my PS3's sat lonely most of the time.Years later, when the Xbox One and PlayStation 4 were announced I followed the news anxiously, looking for reasons to choose one platform over the other, and I fretted over which system was going to be the right one for me.  I wanted to stay with the Xbox line, but was leery of rumors of new features and/or new ways of installing and use the software on the system enough that I held back waiting for the official announcements of what was coming.  Once those announcements hit, I found myself unable to place any faith in Microsoft that what they were promising was not going to be incredibly harmful to myself and to other gamers.  The ability to trade in old software, sell off used games, and other similar things was going to be gone, or severely limited and restricted in ways that I just couldn't support.  A day or two later, Sony announced what they'd be doing with the PlayStation 4 and at that point, they were instantly the gamers best friends.  No restrictions on selling or trading away disc-based copies of games.  Yay!  Other seemingly draconian restrictions that Microsoft had talked about were also non-existent in the Sony world.  Double Yay.  I quickly placed a pre-order for a Launch Edition (Release date) PS4 system here and then waited impatiently for it to be released.Over the course of the next very volatile few days, Microsoft took a beating in the court of public opinion.  They wound up back-tracking on almost all of the new paradigm they had promised (some would say threatened).  In the end, they pretty much offered up a continuation of what they had done previously, but for me, and many others it seems, it was too little too late.  While I could still have placed an order for an Xbox One system, I had cast my die and my seething and hatred of what Microsoft had said they were going to do couldn't be quelled so easily.Here, (at the time I'm writing this), months later, both systems have been released, and I've been enjoying the use of my PS4 for the first week of it's life.  After installing the requisite launch day patch, there's since been one other firmware upgrade.  There are still features that aren't quite working yet, but should in the future, and certainly patches that will continue to come.  The competition between both major parties will ensure that continues to be the case.End of history lesson.

I ordered on a Thursday, and on Monday the order still hadn't even been processed. However after chatting to customer support they said they would expedite it for me. These people next day airmailed it. WHAT? Anyways, the thrill and delight factor was definitely there.I had read that the box was flimsy. This is semi true. It is shipped in a pretty tight brown box. However inside the brown box were a few of those air pouches. Furthermore, the unit itself sits inside foam inserts so it is pretty safe.I also was concerned about the Blue light death streak. After a four hour game session, it was still good so I guess it's alright.Would definitely do business again, SO LONG AS THE ORDER IS ACTUALLY FULFILLED BY AMAZON.

    Approaching 2 year with my PS4. Loving it still.
  
",5.0,Brandon,"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2014","1. Hardware

As it stands it is the most powerful 8th gen console. It plays games from 720p - 1080p in 30FPS - 60FPS. Games look a tad bit better than the PS3. 500GB of space, but you only get 407 GB in reality. The rest goes toward the OS I guess. I wish Sony given us 1TB instead especially since these games are so large. If you want to upgrade the HDD you can but I recommend waiting. A 4 TB 7200 RPM HDD will cost around 200$ and so will a 512 GB SSD. More space is nice, but for half the price of the system? I'll wait. And SDD's loads games quicker but not by much.

2. Software/OS

It's many times faster than the PS3's OS. Pretty simple as well. That's it.

3. Controller

Major improvement over the PS3's. Bigger, concave thumbsticks, trigger R2 and L2 buttons. Light bar and touchpad are borderline unless in my opinion. The light bar more than the touchpad (unless you have the PS camera). Thumbsticks might be cheaper than the PS3's. Mines got torn up and I have to get a new blue dualshock 4 controller.

4. Games

Had a slow start, but it's getting more games. It's getting more exclusives, playstation only exclusives and console exclusives. I don't want to list them, so I recommend going to wikipedia and searching a list of games on the PS4.

5. Apps

We got more apps. Apps that weren't here at launch are here, such as YouTube. I'm not just, but if we don't have it, I would like funimation and crunchyroll.

6. Online

Now you have to pay for plus to play online. I think it's worth it. You get free games across three platforms monthly. They are quite impressive in my opinion. You ""lose"" these games when your membership expires, but you can either become a member again to play them or just buy them (most likely at a lower price). Look up PS Plus for more details.

7. Features

Shareplay allow you to share games, remote play allows you to stream your games, PS Now allows you to stream older games. Pretty neat features. And these are just a few.

8. Value

The parts was worth 381$ at launch and is priced at 400$ (you can get a free game as well). 400$ for this system seems fair.

Overall enjoying my ps4 and looking forward to the Japanese exclusives (mainly RPGs and JRPGs). Have a PS3? I say keep it. Still games coming out for it and the PS4 isn't natively backwards compatibility.",

  In response to so many reviews about defective units, I thought I'd just say that my PS4 is working fine so far. The only thing I've noticed is that the cooling fan is pretty noisy, but that's it. And it works fine even though the box it came it was unbelievably beat to heck by UPS, to the point the box was noticeably ripped open and taped shut again (Amazon's poor packaging didn't help things).As for the console itself, I see great potential. As with any launch, the games are pretty lacking- my PC would laugh at the new Killzone game, for example (30fps? Really?), but I can't wait to see the future PS4 exclusives coming down the line. Exclusives are going to be the main strength of the PS4 over the XboxOne, which Microsoft has always seemed to have trouble securing outside of Halo. I think if you're like me and have a PS4 and a gaming class PC, you're covered.

",4.0,Rell,"Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2014","









  
  
    
  Its great but seems a little sub par UI Wise (User Interface).Multiple things I miss that was on Xbox Live.Some examples...1.After playing a game there is no slide with recent opponents therefore you cannot say GG (Good Game), give them tips on how to improve or my favorate which is rage message them if they play cheap. If you think someones a beast you have no slide to click his/her name, you must write it down on paper and send a request after game.2.No Stick Figure Avatars, I miss dressing up my little dude previewing parties seeing him next to my friends avatars. On PS4 your avatar is like a profile picture. *Yawn boring.3.No Backgrounds!!! C'mon son seriously people say it doesn't make much of a difference but it does. After having the PS4 for two weeks it becomes mind blowing and remember I previously had Xbox 360 which let me make the back ground whatever I wanted.4.As of now no YouTube App yea I know we all have it on Mobile devices but still the PS3 has it and the cheapest Cell Phones have it this Console costs $400 it should have the Youtube App.5.You must purchase music... Seriously??? No thank you PSN why cant we insert USB's and play/save music from those like we use to? I Hope Sony doesn't profit off this ignorant move.6.Doesn't show when friends come online, go offline and were last online. This is a pure Head-shot.Iv'e talked to some friends and read reviews on PSN+. PS3 it was free now they charge $50/year RIGHT? So I'm thinking ""Man they're probably going to upgrade the online"" NOPE its still the same, this is something I couldn't determine myself because I had Xbox BUT its what PS3 owners told me.When the Xbox One gets a price cut (and you're not forced to get the Kinect) I'll pick it up and pass this down to a loved one.NOT because its bad, I'm just spoiled from all the UI features from Xbox Live. 4.5 Stars

    Great  console overall but 2 problems
  
",5.0,dj mark,"Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2014","









  
  
    
  My ps4 arrived June 4 and i ordered it June 1 when i first got it i hoped my console wasn't DOA (Dead on arrival) and it wasn't. when i UN boxed it i looked and i saw a special offers card it came with 3 codes worth of 10$ and i entered them in and they did not work. i looked at the card and it said they expires 3/31/14 and that told me my ps4 was a launch day console . i called Sony and they told me to call the retailers i got the console from which is amazon i called amazon told them about the codes and they refunded me 30$ dollars that problem was solved. my next concern is my controller the first couple of days it was working fine and then my battery was down so i plugged in the charger and the controller didn't charge but it was on and if i unplugged it. it will go dead in seconds so it was acting like a wired controller basically i called  Sony again they emailed me a receipt so i can print it and package it with the controller  but my console was a launch day so by my controller being broken its been sitting in the shelf for more than 6 months and the battery cant hold the so yea other than that the ps4 is awesome i never had problems with the console i rate this 5 stars because if i hadn't received a Launch day console i wouldn't have these problems and i recommend buying this console just from a store near you so you can get quick refund but if you do wanna buy from amazon i recommend buying a 2nd controller just in case you don't have to en counter the problem i had . i hope you found this review helpful

  I originally had pre-ordered the Watch Dogs bundle, but we all know what happened to that. I'm glad Amazon decided to update my order into a Launch Edition package. They even gave me some credit towards the purchase of a different PS4 game. That's swell! Thanks Amazon! Got my system on launch day as promised. Too bad it was UPS instead of FedEx because UPS always delivers a little late in my area; I didn't receive my system until 7pm. First world problems. *shrug*There are many reviews out there regarding the hardware so I don't really need to add my 2 cents into the pool, but I will say that the system has thus far exceeding my expectations of what a console should be. Except for the relative lack of media support compared to the previous generation, I'm pretty happy with how responsive the system is and how well it handles my games. I mean, c'mon, I didn't even consider that playing games while the software installed was possible! Sony made a product that's truly great and hopefully the owners will get to experience games that fully take advantage of the hardware capabilities of this magnificent machine.

    Still happy after one year
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2013","Let me talk a little about the console.

We've had ours since launch day because... we preordered one the day preorders were possible. Our expectations were high for the console build and features and realistic for the launch date games and both expectations were generally met. In other words, we are happy so far and we are happy to see that every firmware update gets us a slightly more capable gaming console and every month there are new good, sometimes great and every once in a while awesome games released, some multi-platform, some exclusive.

So, without regurgitating published specs... let's talk about what you get out of a PS4

THE AWESOME AND THE GOOD

Here they are, first briefly, then discussed below.

- Awesome, flawless graphics. No, I am not comparing the PS4 to gaming PCs that cost 2-3-4 times as much. For what we pay, and comparing the PS4 to the previous generation of consoles, the graphics a quite impressive. And it's not just resolution but the console's ability to keep track of a lot more independently moving objects without slowing down or dropping frames.
- Near-revolutionary new DualShock 4 controller. Battery life is not that great (get a second if you can spare the extra cash) but I do appreciate the added in-controller speakers, the clickable touchpad and the way the slightly beefier controller feels.
- When compared to the PS3, 10x the processing power, 32x more RAM and it shows.
- Digital content is available at whatever PS4 you log into
- HDD still upgradeable without voiding warranty - popped in a 1TB 7200 RPM upgrade and it was easy.
- No power brick
- Game and chat audio can be sent to a headset through PS4's 3.5mm port.
- Many media apps: Netflix, Amazon, etc. and the list is constantly growing.
- Online access is 100% optional. Yes, you can do it all, including system patches without ever connecting your PS4 to the Internet.
- PS Plus subscription only required for (most) multiplayer games, not for media services.
- PS Plus offers a couple of good 'free' games, some older AAAs, some new indies every month and you can play them for as long as you are subscribing.
- Plenty of sharing, social features

THE UGLY AND THE BAD

And... yeah, not everything is awesome and here it is what needs to be fixed or get better so that we all become a happy gaming family. This may seem to be a long list but I am confident that quite a few of the items below are going to be addressed sooner rather than later and nearly all of them before the end of 2014.

- No Media Server/DLNA support and this is one of the few reasons our old PS3 is used almost as much as the PS4
- No support for audio CDs (no big deal to most but still dumb)
- No support for Bluetooth headsets (I bet they'll fix this soon)
- No support for mice of any kind (Bluetooth or USB)
- DS4's lightbar can't be turned off completely even though it can be dimmed a little
- Doesn't play PS3 games except for the few available as streaming rentals and the price for that service is not 'right'.

FIVE STARS IF THIS SUITS YOU

There are different bundles available so it's good to be able to pick the one that fits you best. Promos come and go so take advantage of one. I noticed that at the time I am writing this review you get one of 4 free games as a download which is nice.

  It's been 3 days now and the device seems to be working perfectly. There were very little cosmetic flaws nothing more than a slight scuff. Three stars because although it is pictured with a controller  it does not come with one.  I did try to get in contact with them beforehand to check if it came with a controller but because the item was in the warehouse they were not able to verify.

    Good system, one major flaw for me
  
",3.0,P N,"Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2013","









  
  
    
  So I ordered this ps4 day one.I received it and everything was packaged minimally.Pros:It's first and foremost a video game system.Controller is so much better than the ps3 dualshock.The console has a very small footprint and looks cool (vertical or horizontal).I like the upgrade-able hard drive and bluetooth connections.Runs pretty quietly.I like how I can get playing almost immediately after putting in a disc (instead of waiting for the whole install).I like that it didn't come with needless peripherals (i.e the ps eye).Cons:Biggest flaw, no dlna / media server. I still have my ps3 hooked up to watch local content on my network storage. This is a really big deal that they could update later but at this point in time (12/24/13) have not. Why remove such a huge feature? Oh I know, it's because they want to tout PSN's streaming service.Did I mention it won't play cds? Oh it's because they want you to buy music unlimited.It has bluetooth, but older bluetooth devices don't work....I'm talking about the ps3 official remote control.The menu system isn't as intuitive as the old ps3.While I don't mind paying to play online, it does suck you used to not have to.Overall good, but needs to update with old features the ps3 had.

    Wonderful Gaming Future
  
",5.0,Aven,"Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2014","









  
  
    
  2/20/14I'm really pleased with the performance of the PS4 so far. I was really worried about the infamous blue-light of death I've heard many people talk about, but I've used the PS4 multiple times in the few hours I've had it, and it always responds well. I hope it continues to do so. The mechanics are great, but I've yet to experience the gaming greatness.I don't have any games for it so far. The only thing I've done so far is link my Amazon Video to it, but I intend on getting some games soon. My main interests are in Assassin's Creed Four and Battlefield Four. The latter is particularly exciting for me. I'm going to get PS Plus so I can play the multiplayer. The 64-man madness is something I've been anticipating for a while, and it is simply too good an opportunity to pass up. However, I am going to attempt to be patient and wait a little longer to get BF4 since I understand there are a lot of updates needed to make the game a better experience. So, I plan on getting started on Assassin's Creed in the meantime. I understand people are upset with the dearth supply of games, but it's been only three months since the launch. Building a diverse shelf will take some time, but I'm not really worried about it.Some great games are just around the corner. Watch Dogs is a game I anticipate when June arrives. Another game I'm really looking forward to is Middle Earth: Shadow of Mordor. It does not have a release date yet, so I cannot honestly say this will come out any time soon. However, the AI for the game sounds fantastically challenging. Murdered Soul Suspect, Evolve, and Final Fantasy XV are all games I also really want to try. Another tentative yet awesome announcement is Red Dead Redemption 2 (or RDR three to those who've played Red Dead Revolver). I just recently learned it is being made, but I imagine it won't be released for another year. Anyway, these are just a few of my personal in-the-waiting favorites. I'm sure the PS4 will definitely grow a diverse selection of games.In the end, I am really looking forward to testing the PS4's full power. It's going to be an exciting new chapter for Playstation. I can't help but express my bias by giving this a five-star rating. I really enjoyed the Xbox 360, and I'm sure the Xbox One is also a great product. Yet, I wanted to stick to a platform I'm really familiar with, and the Playstation has been my life-long companion.2/22/14I've ordered Assassin's Creed Four and I anticipate it will arrive very soon. I've still only been able to use PS4 for simple things like Amazon Video and Crackle, but it's still handling well. It remains problem free, and I've explored most of the console's features.I like the continued use of the main task bar. I'm used to the theme-oriented backgrounds made available on the PS3, so the lack of customization and personalization is somewhat depressing. However, even if this isn't changed in the future, I'll be fine with it (although I suspect some changes will be made).I should mention to prospective buyers that you cannot add music from an MP3 player or CD to the PS4. I find this to be a significant loss. I had thought this sort of thing would transfer over to PS4 since it would reinforce the versatility of Playstation consoles, but I am hopeful this will change. According to an article on Eurogamer.net, this will likely be modified in the not-so distant future. I imagine other sort of personalizing features and apps will be added to the PS4 over time. If these are things you look for in a gaming console, you may not want to buy it right now.  The lack of UI customization is linked to Sony's primary efforts to create a platform oriented primarily for gaming, so we'll see what will become of the UI in the future.This is probably the most notable deficiency I've noticed for the PS4, but I still think the quality of the PS4 UI at this time is really good, even if it isn't entirely optimized. Overall, I am still very pleased with the PS4. I anticipate it will be a permanent item on my TV stand.3/01/14I got Assassin's Creed Four a few days ago, and I love it. The look and feel of it on the PS4 is nothing short of fantastic. The processing power of the Playstation Four really pulls out the minute graphic details and creates a smooth image. I really don't have much else to say until I've played it a bit more. I also decided to get BF4 given the price reduction and the player appreciation for the entire month of February. It is also runs well on the PS4 and looks absolutely stunning. Check out my review on it if you wish. The PS4 is still running well and I am extremely pleased with it. This is all really have to say for now.

    Overall very happy with the system - small issues here and there
  
",5.0,Greg D,"Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2014","









  
  
    
  I purchased this at launch but since everything was brand new I wanted to give it a good bit of time before writing a review.  Overall I'm very happy with the system.  I never owned a PS3 - I had a 360.  It wasn't a console war thing I just don't have the time or space for more than one system.  I was happy with the 360 but when looking at the next gen I made the switch when I really started getting into my Vita and PS+.  I'm really happy with my choice.  The console and graphics are amazing, the performance has been fluid and the controller feels good to me and is laid out well.  Once I finally got all the settings and tweaking correct (both with the systems and my WiFi) the remote play with the Vita is awesome.  The future looks good with all the games I'm seeing previews for so I really have no regrets.  Shame I can't play some of the PS3 games I have from PS+ on this but since it's truly next gen I understand.I am starting to have issues with the controller however.  The rubber pad on the left stick has torn along the bottom edge.  My R1 button is starting to stick as well when I press it from the right side.  It's starting to become a problem when playing certain games so I need to call Sony about it.  I kinda want to dock a star for this (the controller, especially with only 1, is pretty key) but we'll see how Sony handles my request for a repair.  When the controller was new and with everything else considered this console has delivered for me.

    Advanced but buggy console
  
",4.0,Mark Cardinal,"Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2014","









  
  
    
  We got our PS4 delivered on launch day. After about two months of use, we have a clear idea on how this console actually plays vs. the pre-launch media hype. We have never owned a Playstation or Xbox of any generation, but we do have a gaming PC.Pros:- Great graphics in 1080p, good performance. The indie titles like Flower and Contrast actually show off its graphics better than Madden, probably because the big games were all designed with the older generation in mind.- Good selection of non-game apps. Not as wide a selection as the Roku, but certainly better than Apple or Chromecast. You can finally watch Netflix or Amazon Prime on your console in full 1080p glory!- Wide variety of power-saving and auto-shutoff options- Add your fellow PS4 users to your friends list, share clips or achievements, find each other ingame- Easy drop-in multiplayer gaming on the same console.- Gaming quality is comparable to my PC (not the highest-end PC ever, but pretty good all the same)Cons- Lack of games. But, this is always true at every new console launch. 2014 will see the game catalog start to catch back up to PS3 levels.- BUGS. One of the most annoying one is the wifi failing to work sometimes for no apparent reason. Only turning the system off and on can fix it. Also, turning on and getting nothing but a black screen sucks, especially since there is no hard power switch on the unit. You have to literally unplug the PS4 and replug it in. And there hasn't been an update from Sony in weeks. Can't separate their engineers from their bongs, I guess.- Can't play PS3 games! You'll have to hang on to your old PS3 for the foreseeable future :(- Hard to obtain. I saw this console being offered for close to $1000 just before Christmas.- Expensive controllers at 60 bucks a pop. Want a full set of 4? You'll have to cough up $180 plus tax.- Lack of same-console multiplayer options in favor of single-player FPS games. This is more of the fault of gaming companies, but still. When can we get our GoldenEye back?

  buy it. it's perfect. My only complaint was the packaging it was sent in. Amazon sent this in a large box filled with other items I purchased. I know that is very standard but all the smaller items were loose in the box and the ps4 (in its own packaging) was also an inch shorter than the shipping box so it was also loose and moving freely in the box with the other items. Was very hard to carry from my door to my kitchen with everything shifting i can only imagine how it was to move from place to place and its bumpy ride in the back of the postal truck.

  Only had this for a week after waiting for months to finally get one. The system is nice looking and stylish, has plenty of storage (500Gb) and is as you would expect a new system to be from Sony. The games are limited for now, but Assassin's Creed Black Flag is good and the graphics in Kill Zone are great! The only thing I noticed so far that I did not like was that it only seems to have HDMI out. I may be wrong, but I like the options that the PS3 had for outputs. Over all though this is a great system!

  Countless reviews have already said how great the PS4 is, let me complain about the one big issue Sony's new system for game management. Each and every game, regardless of if you have the disc or download code, must be loaded onto your hard drive. Soon enough it becomes a matter of storage management before each new game you buy. Take this as a warning and be sure to buy the largest hard drive you can afford for your system.

  The controller provided with this device is beyond faulty. The headphone jack doesn’t connect properly, and the controller vibrates constantly even when not being used. If it is switched on or connected to power it will vibrate at high speed even if untouched. This only stops when it is turned off.

  After months of waiting for this system I would say it was a definite worth of wait. I order the system in late Jan and receive it less than a week from ordering it. I have seen a few reviews and videos of shipping from here and was worried due to the packaging epically living overseas.The package was very well protected with a thick bubble wrap as well as some air packs. So as to ensure the package well kept safe.On to the goodies. I was very impressed on the detail and design. the PS4 was very sleek and beautiful. I was very worried because you hear some stories of the blue light of death and so far no problems. Easy to install and man using the interface took a little while but not to long and was welcomed to the world of the ps4.The Controller: Holding and using the new ds4 also took a little bit to get use to it but i love the feel of the controller. the only issue i had far so with it was the light bar but it is what it is. It had a very sleek design as well to go along great with the system itself. I am going to buy another one at a later date.I also hear a few people on here with some wondering if they would still come with 30 day PS plus as well as the 10 credit. I received  mine with the 10 credit and the 30 day music trial so no free 30 day. but to me its fine only because i already have the plus which has it perks!overall the system is great and i love it especially syncing with my Vita. I wish that they had more games out especially during the release. But i think the best is yet to come So thanks Amazon for helping me stay a PlayStation fan for life

  Arrived on time and work perfectly out of the box. The graphical upgrade is nowhere near as night and day as the ps3 from ps2, but it's still noticably sharper and more detailed than the previous gen. The social aspects of this console are wonderful: easy to use and fun to capture video and share with friends, cross game chat finally, real friends names, Facebook connectivity, all are welcome additions. The game library is a little lacking (as far as the first party games or concerned) but with a solid lineup of third-party games as well as a history of eight years of solid PS3 exclusives I have no worries that the games will come; plus we've already had an announcement for uncharted 4, which is worth the price of admission on its own.

    best video game machine ever
  
",5.0,Johny Luong,"Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2014","









  
  
    
  this is by far the best video game console ever created. i bought the xbox one day one and havent really enjoyed the console much. it was only the variety of games xbox one had to offer that i saw as an advantage over the ps4. however, i was surprised at how much difference the controller made. the ps4 controller is also the best controller out there. it is almost like a ps3/xbox 360 hybrid controller. it looks like the ps3 controller yet it feels as good as the 360 controller did with the upgraded l2/r2 buttons and the thumbsticks. the grip feels so nice you dont have to squeeze the controller to hold it comfortably. the ps4 is also significantly smaller and more compact than the xbox one. the xbox one has an external power source with the utilization of the very space consuming power brick while the ps4 is lighter and it has an internal power source. the xbox one has better games, but the ps4 just looks better and has a better controller and in my opinion better value with the addition of a cheaper online subscription service which also includes better offers than xbox live deals

  Worked well for about a month and then it started overheating. The PS4 does not work for more than a few minutes at a time. Since it is out of warranty and the return window is closed, I'm out of luck here. I have tried opening it up and blowing the dust out, that only slightly helped. It fails over and over. What a complete waste of money. I have since purchased a new unit under warranty from Best Buy. I wasted $200 trying to save a buck. I am 100% not satisfied with this order.

  I will admit that I prefer the Xbox One over the PS4 because of the overall experience (controller, xbox live, etc). I have been waiting for a good reason to buy the PS4, and the deal of Amazon ( PS4 + The Last Of Us + Bloodborne + 20 Store Credit ) was exactly was I was waiting for.In terms of graphical display, I am not sure if I can see a real difference between the PS4 games and XB1. There is for sure since the specs favor the PS4. But I cannot notice it, so I leave it to those with super eyes to decide. The one thing I notice with the PS4 games (Bloodborne, the last of Us, Shadow Fall) is that while the graphics are beautiful the world seems empty.With the graphics out if the way, I have to say that this machine is a piece of art. I love the simplistic approach of sony on this powerful little guy. Nice looking, small footprint and good quality.The only difference is that the ps4 does not support External usb HardDrive to store games and play them from there like the XB1. While I can upgrade my internal storage to a bigger drive I am not convinced that i want to do that. So this may limit my game library.This deal on Amazon cannot be beat. I am having a great time playing the last of us, and my game library just increased to 3 more games. If you can afford and have the time I recommend to leave the fanboy stuff aside and buy both, your fun will only double.

  Absolutely love it. Has been flawless so far since day 1 when I received it after I was 1 of the 1st to pre-order it as soon as I heard about it, It has a better design than my PS3 original curved top system. With the new update as of 5.1.14 its even better with share factory & the ability to turn DHCP off so you can record longer gameplay. I've always been a PlayStation kinda guy. It's a little better than the competitions system in memory speed only, it gets the job done fast, does everything a reg computer does, & is a little more geared towards games & not the entertainment center catch all.

  The console worked perfectly when I first received and it kept working over the weekend. What I experienced while it was working was great. It was fast, I never had any issues with long downloading times - in fact, even though it is launch week, it was still faster then on the PS3 and XBOX 360. So even though there isn't many options for good games yet, I was still very pleased with it.But today when I tried to turn it on I had the blue flashing light and no audio or visual signal was reaching my tv. When I called playstation customer service, I did have to wait about 15 minutes on hold but the service agent was very polite and over all the customer service was excellent. I will be sending my PS4 in and they will be sending me a new one.So, over all, even though I did get the crappy blue light, when it works this is a great console.

    The PS4 welcomes you to next gen gaming
  
",5.0,Scott P.,"Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2013","









  
  
    
  Decided during E3 that I was going to go with the PS4 due to price and Sony's attention to the gamer vs. publishers with the then controversial Xbox One decision to halt used game sales.  Microsoft went back on that but the good will that Sony earned, plus the $100 price difference really drew me in.I got my console on release day and after a few hiccups with setting up the internet (which could have been user error) I was ready to roll.  The UI is basic, but that's not a negative.  Everything you need is on one bar that scrolls horizontally.  Your most recent games played come first and the game in the console itself is the first in line.  Your video services are grouped in a video folder of sorts to avoid clutter and the overall experience of finding a game and playing it is seamless.  I can see this possibly being an issue later in the console's life when there are a lot of games to sort through but I doubt this will be the design choice the PS4 has in 5 years.  Software updates come and go and I'm sure it'll change.The real draw of any new console though is what it can do.  This particular device plays PS4 games and those games look amazing.  There aren't a lot of games out right now to actually play but the ones out of note include Killzone Shadow Fall, Assassin's Creed 4, Need for Speed Rivals, and Resogun.  If you picked up only those games you'd be set for a true next gen experience with amazing visuals and all around great games.The PS4 is a great investment if you're looking to get into next gen gaming on the console.  The Xbox One is an alternative choice for people who want a more media focuses experience, but for those of us who want to spend less for just an all around great gaming console, you can't go wrong with the PS4!

  Everything it does, it does very well. A few things that I would warn others of before a purchase follow.It has 4 USB slots but will not recognize/play any audio or video on a thumb drive. I had hoped to move the ps3 from the living room to the bedroom, but since we use it for home videos, photos and playing music, it has to stay there. I know it's a game console, but it came with about 10 or so apps (premium services) for streaming video and music.One other thing is the way it handles downloads/updates. It's great that everything happens in the background, but you no longer have the ability to pause and resume downloads. You can only cancel them. That means, if you want to watch a movie and download a demo, they both suffer or one gets stopped. No thumb drive mp4 support and not being able to pause downloads is a losing combination. Downloading several at once takes forever as we'll.It's very good at what it does, but it's certainly no replacement for a ps3.

  I was fortunate enough to find this in stock on Amazon last week so I knew it wouldn't be in stock for very long and got it at retail price instead of the marked up price by 3rd party resellers. I don't have any games for it yet but did get it hooked up and luckily, this wasn't DOA like a few unfortunate customers. It took a few minutes for the system to download updates and install software with a couple system restarts. HDMI cables were provided which was good so you don't need to buy any cables. After updates, the hard drive actually only showed 408GB available so it's not the full 500GB. I've never owned a Playstation before so this is all new to me. I've always been an xbox owner with xbox and xbox360. I wanted to go with PS4 this time because of all the negative things Microsoft was doing with it's xbox one and later backtracked.Since I don't have any games yet, I was able to test out Darknight Rises on Bluray and it was excellent picture quality and sound. I'll probably order a game soon, maybe killzone. The Dualshock 4 controller feels awesome! I always thought the past controllers that I used when playing playstation at friend's house was too small and didn't feel right. For this latest controller, everything feels comfortable.

",5.0,Synoke,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2014","









  
  
    
  There are so many things that I could say about this console, but I will just choose a few. Some people have gotten bad consoles, it happens, it's called DOA or Dead on Arrival. Which means electric currents went through them during shipping etc after manufacturing at some point. I got a good console on January 15th, which is the best time to get one since most ""manufacture"" issues are fixed.GAMES: Lets just say games are always going to minimal at any launch. We look at the PS4 and we see a small selection, did you buy PS+ or PlayStation Plus? Well look no further you get a free game per month when you are subscribed which is now required for online play, here is the thing Xbox One doesn't do the free Games, Like PS3 as more games become available, we get more per month. So far I have gotten: Don't Starve: Console Edition, Outlast (Really cool Horror game) and Dead Nation a zombie game similar to Diablo 3 on consoles. Overall the games are great for what I have paid for!Console: The console and the OS (Operating System) are really smooth, user friendly, and very slick. It's amazingly fast also. I can say it does lag at some times, but when you have a console with a new OS of course there will be issues which can be fixed in updates etc. Overall I have no issues with the system.

  To put it simply; I am amazed, not only with the Sony PS4 console, but with Amazon's customer-centric business ethic. So this is a two part review/critique.Up first is Amazon. I was skeptical to pre-order a launch console to begin with let alone from any business that guarantees debut date delivery, but once again though Amazon shines through and my PS4 was waiting for me by my door when I came home from work. It is this kind of dedication that is missing in most business performance models nowadays. It seems most companies let the number of dollar signs do the steering, but when it comes to Amazon; they know that a happy customer means more in the long term. KUDOS!As for the PS4, the word to encapsulate every aspect of the system is SEAMLESS, from its modern sleek aesthetics to its speed. Once I unpacked, set up, and walked through the console's induction ceremony I downloaded and installed the system update. In a blink of an eye it was complete. I moved onto the code redemption for my preordered games. BOOM! done.  Then I downloaded some apps. BOOM! done.  I then moved through the interface looking and learning. Simplistic, ease of use, as is the perfected controller, granted I am still adjusting to the swiping sensor during game play, but I am getting there. The console on and off is a new aspect I have to learn to embrace. Not having a hard power button is different, but the tech exists so Sony is using it full force which just enhances the form following function by not having old school buttons to mash. Over all, I cannot wait to see future games. The potential for this system is probably no different from PC gaming, but the integration of social media and entertainment sets it apart and brings new dimensions and capability to gaming.So happy.

  Love the system.  Would have liked more than 2 usb ports for attaching controls/ect.  With only 2 it limits how many devices I can attach at once.  Also because the camera is proprietary and there is not an extension cable available it limits placement.  The 3D/picture quality, 7.1 sound and overall navigation is great.

  I managed to get my PS4 by coming to Amazon at midnight on November 14th. 3 minutes after midnight I was able to go ahead and order my PS4.  It arrived on Monday the 18th with two day Prime shipping and I was disappointed with the packaging.  There wasn't enough packing materials in the box to keep the contents from rattling around. If this box had been shaken the contents would have been damaged. This is my only complaint about this order.I've had no problems with the PS4 itself.  the console set up easily and has been running now used heavily without problem. If anything changes I'll update this review. So far so good. I'm loving it. One needs to understand that with a million units sold in the first 24 hours, network traffic will be heavy. This is not the fault of the console. I found that in the late night hours Eastern Standard Time the network tends to be less busy and things download quicker.In playing Call of Duty Ghosts both on the PS3 and the PS4, I can see all the differences between the next gen and its predecessor.  The DualShock 4 controller is amazing.  It's tighter in the analog sticks with indentations and rubber coating.  It makes gameplay much easier and less stressful on the thumbs.  There was no frame freeze or lag, unlike my experience with the PS3 version.Warframe is a definite plus. I've been waiting for it to come to console and the PS4 is a worthy candidate to handle it.  After playing last night for a few hours, there was absolutely no frame freeze or lag either.Though there are a few features missing now that I'd like to see, I'm sure future updates will remedy my desire.  I'll definitely be adding the camera to this one as I can see Sony is doing major development in that arena.

New video game releases are starting to pick up now compared to when it first released.  Recently just purchased Infamous: Second Son and Watch Dogs comes out in a few more weeks.  These are the games that drew me to the ps4 in the first place.  Not to mention, they are coming out with a remastered edition of The Last of Us, one of my favorite games of all time.  These are still sold out in retail stores so probably Amazon is your best bet on purchasing one.

  The PS4 itself is pretty sweet.  Boots up way faster than the PS3.  Takes a while to get everything up and running to include all the latest software downloads and installs.  The absolute best upgrade from PS3 is the font type and size.  I always had to sit close to the TV to read anything because the font was so tiny.  With the PS4, I can sit 10-12 feet away and read information on the screen easily.  The PS4 also has additional apps at the ready for video/music and can run streaming apps such as Hulu, Amazon, and Netflix.  This makes it a great all-around entertainment system.  I'll leave all the techno-babble to others.  Odds are, if you're reading this, you know all the specs already.Pros:Very easy and user-friendly walk-through to set up PS4 to include connection to internetBoots up very quicklyFont type/size fixedEasier lay-out/less sub-menus than PS3Useful initial start-up manual/instructionsDon't need to have PlayStation Plus membership to run apps like Netflix (unlike XBox)Controller is bigger and more wrist-friendlyPS4 is more powerful than XBox One (remains to be seen if games will take full advantage)Cons:Confusing to know if you've quit an application or it's still running in the backgroundReally pushy about connecting to Facebook and/or Twitter (read carefully during initial start-up)Very limited selection of games (not really the hardware's fault, but something to consider for now)

    Wrong Console for a PC Gamer!
  
",2.0,Dan,"Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2016","









  
  
    
  I've owned this console since launch day and each passing year I'm more and more disappointed with it.It seems like every other day Sony is announcing a brand new game for the PS4, but this always ends up being an old indie PC game that has been ported over to the PS4. Sony keeps releasing old indie PC ports, games that are 4+ years old, but marketing them as brand new games!The reason I bought a PS4 was to play the exclusive titles from Sony. I was looking forward to some quirky JRPGs and other foreign content straight out of Japan that I couldn't otherwise get on PC. Unfortunately the PS4 has only a handful of truly exclusive games and it's extremely rare when a new exclusive is announced. The PS Store and in turn my PS+ Instant Games Collection is littered with multiplat indie games and various other garbage that I've already played to death years ago on PC.So far, the only games I’ve been able to enjoy on PS4 are Bloodborne, Killzone, and a few of the PS3 exclusives they’ve re-released for PS4 such as The Last of Us, and Uncharted Collection. The 100’s of other games they’ve brought to the PS4 are either already in my Steam library, or could easily be purchased for a lower price on the Steam store.Now don’t get me wrong, I don’t mean for this to come off as a pro-pc-master-race review or anything. Just try to understand where I’m coming from.In my situation, I have a capable PC, I have a library of Steam games that I’ve been accumulating over 10+ years. I'm looking for exclusives that I could not play on my PC.In my case I truly feel that I would have been better off buying a Wii U or 3DS because of Nintendo’s heavy focus on first party exclusive games and it’s extensive library of highly rated games. I ultimately regret my decision to buy the PS4.Maybe your situation is similar, maybe you should get a Nintendo console too.Of course maybe you don't have a PC, and maybe you've never heard of any of the titles Sony is releasing on PS4. If that is the case, then you could probably benefit from a PS4 and your purchase would be justified. The PS4 is definitely the best PC gaming alternative on the market. If you’re unable to buy or maintain a PC then there is no doubt that PS4 is the way to go.On a side note, the PS TV / PS Vita are a great buy if you're a PC gamer. It has so many incredible exclusive games that you won't be able to play anywhere else. I've spent 100's of hours playing through many different JRPGs on that thing. And the systems and games are cheap as chips these days!

  A late arrival to the XBox 360, I got a gen 1 (and had the ""red ring of death). I then upgraded to the XBox 360s when it came out. With the new gen releases, I wanted to have access to ""the other titles"" so decided to go with the PS4.It arrived with protective air bags on 3 of 4 sides of shipping box. Other than this it unboxed, set up, ran, did the v1.5 and (later) the 1.51 updates without a problem. Played with the available system options and 2 games so far. Only had it for 2 days but it's run at least 6 hours or more; including Netflix streaming.Day 4: Massive session of Killzone yesterday. I have the dual DS4 controller bundle and had to swap out controllers to put the first one on the charger. No bobbles on game play or unit operations. Still pleased with everything except the lack of swappable battery packs on the controllers. Having some audio content come out from the controllers speakers added an interesting layer of play to the game. I wonder if the lack of dimmable LED light bars on the controler is leaching power that could otherwise be optimized if designers were given the ability to power it down if they don't need it.Overall, these are nits being picked in an otherwise great experience.No 1 star fail on this unit!

    A great upgrade from the ps3
  
",5.0,J. Solares,"Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2014","









  
  
    
  I have a PC and love playing on it, but one thing that i kind of lost passion for growing up was upgrading it with new ram and vid cards. so i turned to a ps3 and didnt look back, i still use my pc for steam summer sales and what not but after getting hooked on alot of ps exclusive games, i decided to stay with the ps family. I sold my ps3 and bought a ps4 and i can safely say im loving it so far. The games i have right now are BF4 and infamous 2nd son. I recomend those games because bF4 gives you the scope of what the ps4 can do in MP games (64 players and huge maps). second son looks beautiful and the new framerate looks amazing (mostly when theres 2 or 3 building falling down and you're just causing more chaos with your smoke powers). lucky for me theres so many more games coming, a personal favorite, The last of us remastered (i finished it on ps3 and cant wait to replay it on PS4). I recomend watching a few youtube gamplay videos on youtube and videoreviews of games to see which one fits your taste. Its not much different from the xboxone or the pc when it comes to the visuals of games, alot of art styles out there and gameplay styles. In the end it just comes down to what kind of games you like.The added features are really nice, my favorite being the ability of the PS4 to multitask, I am a very busy person during week days so i cant really play it during work days. But when i am able to play it, I like to start the day by turning it on, playing a game for an hour or 2, go get my bowl of cereal, hit the ps button, start a youtube video (on the browser :(, but the youtube app is coming soon, which i miss from the ps3) finish my breakfast, hit the ps button again and jump right back into where i left the game.I am really happy with this console, no problems so far. theres alot more to tell you about this console but you will be better off going to sony youtube channel (or any other channel) and read and see ALL the capabilities of the system.

",5.0,atomicdp,"Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2014","









  
  
    
  with its sleek new look, super fast and responsive controls, and not to mention the best graphics card on any console, the ps4 is my system of choice. load time are fast and smooth (including downloading time). The online multiplayer is a HUGE improvement from the ps3 and the graphics are crisp and amazing. So far out of all the games I played for the ps4, Battlefield 4 is the only one that really looks like a next gen title. despite all the bad media the game is getting, I have had very few problems with it. as of the latest patches I haven't had any problems with it, def worth it a play through though. As for the PS4, I can't wait to see what this powerful mat chine is going to be capable of.

  I bought this model because it showed that is was a old discontinued model of the PS4. Which led me to believe it was an original model of the PS4, but that is not the case. The Playstation did not come with the original glossy side cover of the Playstation. It was matte black which honestly not the main issue. The issue is with the hard drive. The housing of the hard drive is not compatible with the original at all. The casing where hard drive is to be placed is upside down. The cradle where the hard drive is inserted does fit for the Playstation’s original hard drive. The Playstation screw is in the front and not the side where it should be. I am highly disappointed thinking the Playstation would be a replacement for my old one but I was completely wrong. Everything about the machine does not match up to the way it was originally created by Sony. I did not plug the system in because it does not have the capability for me to insert my Nyko modular attachment which hold my main hard drive of 4TB for my Playstation. I even have the pictures of a side by side comparison. I am so heartbroken about this product.

  Forget the “PRO”, the original old model is so entertaining to play on.  I’ve had it for quite a few years now and have been enjoying it since. Arrived well packaged without any damage at all. It is unfortunate however you have to buy more gigabytes or delete some game data in order to enjoy new games though, but oh well, it’s all business unfortunately.

  Not necessarily needed at the moment as I do still play my PS3 and PSVita. But they are all connected via the PlayStationNetwork, its a pretty nice feeling. Graphics are fantastic, blue-ray quality is still there and they even simplified the menu and general options. The controllers also seem to melt in my hands, they are by far my favorite out of all PS controllers; it also features a nice touch pad in the middle as well as a small speaker. At the moment this is only used in some games, while other games take advantage of the controllers lighting effects (Tomb Raider). All in all this is a big step forward for all Sony PlayStation players, might not need to get it just yet but it is a very nice option!

The graphics are outstanding. The controller works with my hands and fits perfect. I didn't research the controller very well so when it spoke it startled me, lol. Very cool. I got the one year subscription and I like getting one free game a month. I'm so happy amazon restocked the ps4 because for a long time I couldn't find it in my area in any store.

  Apparently, I'm not allowed to tell others how much better this was wrapped and protected than a new one is. Even though this was listed as used or display model, you'd never know it was. I did not see any cosmetic damage, and everything worked perfectly. The battery life of the controller is substantially longer than the battery life of my older PS4, even though they are the same model. I'm also glad I was able to get a second system without being forced to buy some game I already had or didn't want. This was one of the few I found that wasn't a package deal, it was only what I wanted.

  I've owned systems since NES and now to PS4 and almost everything inbetween, including all of Microsoft's offering UNTIL XBONE. Just to keep things clear, i have been a HUGE sony fan since PS1. But i've owned em all. Coming from a TRUE GAMING background originating from the PC, i can honestly say that im glad to see the PS4 in its current state. its truly a GAMERS console. sorry, but i dont need to talk to my console, nor do i need to wave around my hands like a retard to get it to do things. i have a computer and a tablet for surfing the web, and a perfectly capable box for my satellite to surf my channels. When i power on my GAMING CONSOLE, im doing it to GAME. My PS4 was a launch edition that had ZERO issues, and continues to exhibit zero. I love being able to turn it on, and play a game i want to play on it. Its the truest essence of gaming. I know in time more options will be added to make it more like an entertainment center that the PS3 ORIGINALLY was.(and something XBONE fans seem to forget), and now the XBONE has become. If you're into all of that added luggage, then do not hesitate to buy the xbox one over this console, its by no means a bad console. But if you're like me and tired of gaming consoles trying to be more then what they are intended to be, with gimmicks that offer nothing more then a few novelty features you wont use past a few months, then get a PS4. One look at the oncoming GAMING future of each console will prove my point.

  Obviously we LOVE our PS4. It's been nothing but amazing for us and we were so lucky to get the last batch before Christmas day. It shipped super fast and on time as well. It was a surprise for my boyfriend and after wrapping it and hiding it behind all the other gifts, he literally had no idea. When he opened it, he was speechless that I actually was able to find one in stock and trick him into thinking I didn't' get one (since he wasn't able to find one in-store or online when he looked). We also have the Xbox One and he prefers this console over that one - in case you are deciding between the two for a gift.

  The PS4 is small, sleek and it kinda just works. The games look great, the OS is straightforward and, for the most part, pretty intuitive and the controller feels great in your hands.Where the XBO feels like a reimagining of the console, the PS4 is more like an improvement on the PS3 foundation and I kinda dig that. Everything is familiar to the point where I know where to look, yet still feels new and shiny. And the improvement over the PS3 are vast. Everything is snappy, you can get in and out of games in a snap and you no longer have to quit a game if you want to go to the PSN store or web browser or settings.I've ran into a few minor annoyances though. First one is the buttons. They look like normal buttons but are capacitive (I think). However since they're flush with the system I'm never sure if I'm pressing them or not because there's no feedback. The PS3 buttons always made some kind of sound when you pressed them and it's weird they didn't do the same for the PS4.Also it's great that they expanded the friends list to 2K, but it's almost impossible to manage a list with more than a hundred or two friends. It's an endlessly scrolling list and it refreshes too slowly.The controller battery is also pretty disappointing. And while the idea of plugging in some headphones directly into the controller so you don't disturb those around you when you play late at night is great, the max volume is pretty low. It feels like it's capped halfway.Overall, if you like games, you can't go wrong with a PS4. Currently I'd wholeheartedly recommend it over the competition right now, but only time will tell who the real winner is.

  Ill keep it  short and steer away from the fan boy/ idiot hater rants. It is the best PS ever, simply put. The interface is sonys best so far and on par with the Xbox One (which i also own). The interface is much much better and actually more attractive though less intuitive than Xbox's (though the xbox one is not as good as xbox 360's...see my review). Anyway it is a very attractive unit and looks at home amongst the high end av stuff in my entertainment center. The game quality is fast and beautiful though i only have one cross platform title as of now (assasins creed 4) so the speed difference the PS4 has on paper over the Xbox One is not noticable ( i rented AC4 on xbox one... no visible difference as expected in a cross platform title). The main reason i give it 4 stars is the HORRID controller. In its defense i have never liked sony's dual shock controller, i always though it was too small which leads to finger and hand fatigue. And now that i have osteoarthritis in my hands from limes disease and a lifetime at the keyboard it makes a big difference. I will as always have to wait for Power A to make a Fusion controller to play it. Otherwise a great offering by sony but with so few good launch titles, i find myself not turning it on as much as my xbox one.

  still not much a fan of either Sony or the PS4 itself. however, i will say that mine is of the first model off of the line. and it is still running just fine. ( did replace the thermal paste after the warranty, though )i am just not a fan of the dashboard mostly. it is too clunky and doesn't seem very game oriented. and browsing ones own library is STILL a mess. the what's new screen just never seems to change. just a bunch of spam from yours and your friends activities, with no way to turn any of it off. therefore, Sony cannot deliver directly to their consumers good advertising. ( not sure why they don't fix this. just make a new tab for activity... right? )just a few tips for keeping your PS4 cool...1.) heat rises. so while not really practical, the lower in the room the cooler the PS4 can remain.2.) don't set it on its side. basically you will choke the intake amount of cool air. the little holes there on the side are your intake. when on its side, only a few holes towards the ends will be taking in cool air. if the holes on the other side were larger, it wouldn't be an issue, but then dust would be an issue. whether or not this chokes your intake may depend on your model, just look at it and you will know. maybe check for a stand to buy.3.) despite what is said above, keeping flat on a surface isn't entirely good either. it sits too close to your surface. this causes heat to accumulate in that surface. eventually the surface won't be able to disperse anymore heat, so it returns to the inside of the PS4 increasing ambient temperatures. just stick yourself a small stub in each corner to raise the system about a 1/2 inch from the surface.4.) if your warranty is already void, or don't care... upgrade the thermal paste. (if you don't know how, youtube ought to have sufficient information)

  The Playstation 4 is a major upgrade to the previous Playstation 3. As an Xbox and Playstation user, it's easy to not hold a bias as I've seen the pros and cons to each console.Comparing it to the previous playstation three, the only thing I find that I miss is the ability to upload movies from a USB flash drive, but it's understandable with the new movie features, as Playstation wants you to use those instead.The controller is larger than the PS3 controllers, but it's not overly big, such as the 360 controller, in fact, I find it to be right in the middle and fit comfortably, much more than the PS3 did. The grip is better and I don't find my hands get as sweaty with them.The party chat, which IMO was really the only single thing that held the Xbox 360 above the Playstation 3, works like a charm and identical to that of the 360 (the layout is obviously different).The Playstation 4 has had a 0.4% fail rate, but that's expected with any new electronic device. That however is extremely good for the sum one million plus that have been sold.

  Review in ProgressThis is my first time buying a launch Sony system since the PS2. System is working fine and I'm enjoying my time with the system.  There were some weird glitches on the UI on the first two days, but it appears that it was due to the PSN connection issues during launch. I would hold back on purchasing if you are afraid that you may get a faulty system (Please see all of the 1 star reviews). If you don't mind taking the risk of having to send the system back to Sony I would fully recommend getting one for yourself. It'll be interesting to compare the PS4 launch to the Xbox One to see which has the smoothest launch.This review is ongoing, it may change.. Hopefully my system won't brick anytime soon.3 Stars during 11/15/134 1/2 Starts on 11/19/13Pros:Great Graphics; I'm finding the detail in AC4 to be truly immersive and it's adding a lot to my overall experience.Social: The social aspect of the system is quite fun. It's interesting to watch live streams of other players around the world..It should be better in the future with more a better variety of games and when the system is out in Japan.Cons:Controller battery lasts only 4-6 game play hours; depending on how much a game uses the rumble feature.Current Game library: I know this is typical of a new game system launch.

  This was my first console I've purchased for myself. The product was used but labelled as very good and sold by Amazon.com Services, Inc. Unfortunately the controller only worked when close to the console. The controller had to be within a feet from the console for it to work and even then the connection sometime drops out. Using the USB cable was out of the question as the only method of connection is via bluetooth. Initially I thought that the controller was the issue so I went out and bought a new controller but still the issue persisted meaning the console was defective. Either the device got damaged during delivery or they did not properly test the console. The device is still usable but no to its fullest potential. This was a disappointing and expensive purchase and brings caution towards the labeling of used products that are sold by Amazon.

Hopefully, the developers can stop pushing back release dates and launch some games this Spring/Summer though!If ordering from Amazon, beware of the packaging. I suspect the reason for so many systems being delivered broken is simply because the packaging is absolutely horrible. Literally, one piece of bubble wrap at the bottom and nothing on top. I couldn't believe they would ship a $400 item in such a careless way. I am still baffled by the lack of (basically nothing) protection.

    Not without problems... and key features removed
  
",4.0,Futile,"Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2013","All in all I'm impressed, but its not without its annoyances and problems, and thats why I'm writting this. I hope Sony fix these issues.

I give this four stars as its added all the stuff I wanted added to the PS3 functionality, but unfortunately removed some key things too.

First the good stuff...
--------------------------
* Party Chatting
* Removable HDD
* Quiet
* Charge Controllers while in standby
* Remote Play
* Graphics are great
* Built in PowerSupply (but 120v only)

What I read is coming
----------------------------
* DLNA is coming back
* Support for the PS3 WIreless Stereo Headsets

The Annoyances...
------------------------
PSN
* Once again network was overloaded on day one. Everyone predicted it. Happens everytime there is high demand. Sony should have made sure it didn't happen though (was back online after 3 hours of trying though)
* Sony still don't allow me to use my UK in the USA store. Makes it a problem for me to buy games in the USA where I live and download DLC etc.. Having 2 accounts means I have to pay for PSN Plus twice and also screws up my trophies.

WWW BROWSER
* Slows down the PS4 alot (weird)
* Doesn't support Flash (but does support HTML5... for youtube, goto [...] and click the button request HTML5player)

CROSS COMPATIBILITY
* Can't play PS3 games, nor PSN games downloaded for the PS3

HARDWARE
* No Video Out at first (Got mine at work and tried it on a monitor via HDMI but no video. Tested on another monitor with other cable and worked fine)
* Not a fan of how it looks personally
* Only 2 USB Ports, should have 4
* Doesn't support Bluetooth 4 LE
* Doesn't have Wifi AC
* Power and Eject buttons are surprisingly difficult to press, although not often used

CONTROLLER
* Light on back is a bit bright
* No indicator light on top to know which controller is turned on at a glance
* Options and Share button are awkward to find/press (but getting used to it)
* Dimple in the sticks takes a while to get used to

USER INTERFACE
* Main screen is gonna get cluttered if you have lots of games (I hope they attend to this in a later update)
* Less Organised than the old XMB
* I seem to be missing all the 'down arrow' extended information about each game (I had it on friday, but now its hidden, wonder if its a network issue)

USER PROFILE
* Not easy to see when you are Logged In or Not (I guess the plan is to always be online, but sometimes I don't want to be disturbed)
* Couldn't find a way to set Online Status (to Away or DND)
* Not easy to switch User (forced to log out which turns off controller, then you have to turn it back on etc...)

AUTO UPDATE
* Downloads for other games and updates seemed to happen while I'm in online battle and affects my internet connection. (Think you might beable to turn this off, but I didn't find a way)

MESSAGING
* My PS3 friends see me as offline and chat messages are semi functional
* Cant Send Screenshots to PS3 friends (I want them to see the cool gfx)

SHARING
* Can't Share screenshots to anything but Twitter and Facebook (I use neither)
* Can't set it up to view share options without taking a screenshot (ends up with tons of needless screenshots)
* Can't delete screenshots from the share button window (have to goto profile and click on the folder then options)

CHAT
* Supplied headset is awefully cheap. Plus I can never get those to stay in my ear (I bought the 'PS vita headset' to try out)
* Can't use any (I have 4) bluetooth headsets for chat (device incompatible)
* Can't use the 2 PS3 Bluetooth headsets I own
* Can't use either the old or the next Surround Wireless Headset either (yes I own both)

MULTIMEDIA
* Can't Stream Videos or Music via DLNA (I relied on this)
* Can't play files from external devices either (I relied on this too)

POWER
* Not sure about this.... After 9 hours straight I started getting serious slowdown/choppiness in game, it wasn't hot though (but I think It could have been auto updating in the background and slowing the internet connection, or the controller was about to die)",

  I have had the PS4 for a month now and find it the most advanced gaming console out there. The controller is extremely user friendly and comfortable to hold, esp. for long periods of time. The graphics are incredible and take advantage of the full 1080p HD television's capabilities. I like the speaker in the controller; it is a way to get you really into the game. I have a plus account for my PS3 and it was a little confusing in the adaption to the PS4. I had to call Sony support and they walked me through the process. It took less than 5 minutes. There was no waiting when contacting Sony support and the reps were most helpful. I replaced the 500gb hard drive with a 1.5tb hard drive in no time. Sony made this process quick and easy. I was able to buy this unit for the MSRP of 399.99 when Amazon opened a window of purchase at that price with free shipping. I wasn't going to buy it until the price came down to 399.99 but I got lucky and hit Amazon just as they opened that price window. There is no way I would pay more than the MSRP for the PS4 so you should either wait until you can get this for the MSRP or keep checking Amazon to see if they open a price window. As of this writing, Amazon has opened the window and you can get it for the 399.99 price. The most important thing that Sony can do, though, is to download an update making the unit DLNA compliant. I would be able to integrate my systems with the PS4 and not have to use my PS3 for this process. I am also looking forward to more system updates to include other features not on the PS4 such as backward compatibility.

  This is the console for gaming, IF and only IF you are ready for a higher definition experience than you can get on PS3.  Let's face it, if graphics/game performance isn't an issue, the PS3has a massive library of games (but it should also be noted that Sony is working on streaming those games to your PS4 with 'Playstation Now').I have had the console since launch and have played somewhat heavily ever since.  The controller puts it's seemingly competent predecessor to shame. the tension of the sticks is fantastic, which is very noticeable when playing fast paced shooters like BLR.PS Plus is required for online play but I honestly think PS Plus is an amazing value that might change the way we all play and think of games by offering everyone the same diverse pool of 'free' games via a subscription library (sound familiar? Basically a gaming Netflix).I play on a 52"" display so the resolutions and frame rates offered are a very smooth transition from last generation that is easy on the eyes.  If you want me to argue this console over any other next gen alternative, I will say that I only own the PS4 and plan to build a modular PC to run Windows and Steam OS for my living room.  And that's far more than enough next gen gaming goodness for me.

  After 2 months with the system, there are no problems. I also bought a 1 TB hybrid drive that I put in it from day one. Overall it's a great gaming console. The specifications were the deciding factor for my purchase. The APU with its GCN cores and 8 ACE units deliver 99%  1080p gaming. Also the GDDR 5 ram works better for game graphics. I own a 60"" tv so the resolution of the games is important to me. It's not even close to being as powerful as a gaming PC, but I enjoy playing games on my tv that also has a 5.1 surround sound sytem connected to it. In conclusion: I would recommend the PS4 to anyone looking for a decent piece of hardware.

It also doubles as a Blu-Ray player, web browser, and you can directly stream videos as well as play games.  Sony has a site to download games, or you can order the discs.  There is also a vast online community to share accomplishments.If you are a serious gamer this is the console to get.

  Sony did not disappoint with the newest console...I love pretty much everything about it, but if one thing stands out, it's the major improvement of the controller. It is a vast improvement on the Dual Shock 3. The light is a bit weird, but I understand it has a purpose, as it can be used something like the PS move controller in some applications. Otherwise, the controller is pretty much perfect. The console itself is amazing, looks sleek, it's powerful, and quiet. The next gen games look great, and they will just get better as the developers gain more experience with the new system. Sure, it could use some more games, and features (I'd like to see 3D Blu-ray, for example), but such is the price of being an early adopter, have to be patient. But I think it's fun to ""grow"" with the console, and it's upcoming updates, and features, improvements, etc... The only other thing I'll add is, based on previous history/consoles, Sony tends to make the highest quality hardware on the firstversions, which is why I wanted to get in early.  Think about the first (fat) PS3, compared to the latest version...same thing with the PSP, and now, the PS Vita. In all those cases, the original consoles were traditionally the best built, then, in later versions, Sony tends to cut build costs (and quality, in my opinion).

  I waited a few months before purchasing the PS4, hoping the price would come down a bit.  Then, I found one on Amazon from a 3rd party seller that had a ""Used, like new"" one for $440.  So, I decided to take the plunge.I had read the new dualshock4 controllers were larger, and I completely understand why - for my smaller female hands, the dualshock3 was a perfect fit, but I watched that controller disappear in the hands of some guys.  So, I was a bit apprehensive that these new 4 controllers would be too large for me.  Not so.  In fact - I find them quite comfortable.  I love the new touchpad as well.  Just takes a little getting used to.  Especially since I still play the PS3 games more often.The 4 boots up, connects to internet, PSN, Netflix and games load nearly instantly.  Love the WiFi feature as well!The only drawback that I can see thus far is there currently aren't a large # of titles available just yet for the PS4, but since I'm using it for movies, internet browsing as well as games, I still use it quite frequently.  I notice new games coming out frequently for the PS4, so I'm sure the library of titles will grow soon enough.My TV only supports 2 HDMI devices, so I had to decide which device to unhook - my cable box or my PS3, so I unhooked the cable box connection by just taking out that HDMI cable from the back of the TV.  Since I can watch movies on Netflix, and I still use my PS3 more than the PS4, it makes more sense at this stage.  I know many others are faced with this same dilemma - not enough HDMI ports on their TV's.  It's easy enough for me to reach behind the TV and change the HDMI cables out, but for those who don't have such easy access to the back of their TV's, it will be a harder decision.  I thought of moving my PS3 (or 4) to another room, but decided that having all the gaming in 1 room made more sense, for me anyway.Some may still want to wait until there are more titles available, or the price comes down a bit.  I don't think the PS3 is going anywhere anytime soon, so there is still plenty of time to make that decision.I'm very pleased with the PS4.  I like it's slim/sleek design, the ""standby"" feature - which allows you to charge your controllers but not have the unit ""on"" completely.  There is a software power control feature - which I think is nice as well.  As soon as you insert a disc - it powers on, then (from the menu) you can remove/eject a disc and either put it in stand-by mode or power the unit off completely.There are many new features I haven't even gotten into yet - facial recognition software, PS4 camera, bluetooth, etc.  But I look forward to utilizing all that the PS4 has to offer!

  I was one of the very few lucky ones to purchase one of these PS4 units at midnight the day it went on sale here on Amazon. I bought it for my 14 year old son for Christmas who is a dedicated Play Station user and has been since PS2. So I was very excited that I lucked out and got it from Amazon for the retail price of $399 and free two day Prime shipping , the way it was meant to be. However after reading about the blue light of death and other complaints that reviewers were posting I spent the next couple months stressing and praying the unit I purchased would be ok. Well I guess the man upstairs heard me because we hooked this baby up Christmas morning and had no problems at all. Connecting was easy and after turning it on setup was just as easy. Downloaded some updates and connected to PSN without any problem using his old Play Station Network user name and password he had with PS3. The performance and graphics are absolutely amazing! Far better then PS3. Even the new Battlefield 4 game that so many reviewers complained about seemed run almost flawless for my kid. He also has Assassin's Creed and Kill Zone  for PS4 that are even  more amazing! It was a very Merry Christmas!

Just before I threw the new system through my television set, I calmed my head and went to my computer.  Took about 5 minutes to download the patch onto a USB and another 5 to upload to the PS4.

  I got mine on 24th right before Christmas. I was a bit worried the blue light of death like other reviewers claimed, but fortunately everything works perfect.The setup is a breeze and straight forward. After connected to internet, the instruction prompted me update the firmware to 1.52, the procedure was fast and smooth, after reboot from the new firmware, all the applications are available on the dashboard ready for download and installed.I tried a couple of apps: Netflix and Amazon Prime, they both works flawless. you can switch the app and resume the video from where you left. The web browser works good once I get use to the control. I also tried a couple of games, they launched fast and all works perfect.I took one star away for the following reason:1. the software is not quit there yet: the web browser doesn't support flash video, i.e in youtube, it only plays HTML5 videos. ironically it's portable cousin ps vita can play both no problem.2. the current available apps are highly functional overlap and lack of apps in other genre. for example, facebook, skype, youtube apps will be nice if they are coming in the future.3. the Sony server seems not stable or over loaded sometimes. I have encountered fail to connect to server a couple times when I was setting up the console.4. the battery life of the control is not so great. the way to turn it off is kind of clumsy. the blue light can't be turn off unless the control is off, it's kind of annoying.Over all I am happy with my purchase.

  This system came in fast and worked perfect right out of the box even included an HDMI cable. The controller is amazing and I prefer it over the x box one controller and the x box 360 controller. The controllers handles are longer and more ergonomic than the shorter more edgy ps3 controllers. I started out with Tomb Raider Definitive Edition and Thief (both awesome) and the loading screens were always under 20 seconds and these graphics are mind blowing. The camera for the system is $60 so that's not too bad if you're into that stuff. There are a few mini games the system comes with for the motion control and camera, and you can download free add ons. The overall battery life of the controller isn't the best. I think the ps3 controller had longer battery life than these. The sleek design of the system looks really good on your entertainment center. Viewing netflix and other video services is easier than ever because you can press the ps button while watching a movie and it goes to the menu, then go to netflix again and it is still where you left off. Same with any application, even games. So far a really awesome game system and a nice investment.

  I love it! I was looking to get an Xbox1 as so many people had an Xbox360 but when I saw that PS4 was outselling Xbox 2 to 1, it was a no brainer. Also, the hardware is definitely better on the PS4 and no software tweaks will bridge the gap. Yes, the Xbox1 is pretty damn comparable and you might not notice the differences with your naked eye or on certain televisions but the difference is there in the hardware, no doubt about it.I like this PS4 as it is fast to load up, quick to boot games, and it does everything I want. I definitely would recommend this to all my friends!The controller is also heavier than before which makes it feel pretty sturdy. I actually have dropped it 1 time and it has no scratch on it (thank god). Also, the controller is a little bigger and feels better than the Dual Shock 3 of the PS3.All in all, I have had no issues and I bought it in February. Amazing!!!!! Cant wait for the games coming up in the summer to see how developers have taken advantage of the hardware in the PS4.

Overall a great purchase so far.  The only downside I can think of is that this console is still new and the development of a library of games is still under way, so it may not have tons to offer the hardcore and time intensive gamer just yet, but per Sony between studios creating games and their work on backward compatibility through the Gaikai cloud scheduled for this year, the library is coming.

  What more is there to say about this system except, if you want the most diverse range of games out there, then this is where you should be playing. General game players see the word indie game and think that just because a game is not Uncharted, Halo, Call of Duty, etc., that the games are not worth it. There are so many games coming out for this thing that are not mainstream yet are mainstream quality that your head would spend.

  First, let me start off by saying that I'm am a very hardcore Xbox 360 fan; However, I still own a PS3 and now the PS4. I decided to pre-order this console over the Xbox One console this past summer because Microsoft came up with bright idea that they should limit or pretty much eliminate buyer/player freedom over games; new only, no used or reused games on their beloved next-gen console ( they soon changed that). So anyway, I pre-ordered this console from Amazon.com and I received it 11/18/13. After I read several negative reviews from this website, I wondered if I made a wrong decision...the answer is not at all.The console itself is pretty light weight compared to the original PS3; the design is sleek and innovative. The set up was simple and easy, I think it was set up to the TV in about 5 minutes. This was met with some reserve because I was waiting for the ""blue light of death"" to appear and it didn't...I was ecstatic. So then I began to set up my user account and if you have a PS3, then you can connect to the same account. I accidentally set my PS4 under another name so I have two Playstation accounts. So, getting set up was pretty simple and I like the new menu interface over the older PS3 crossbar media interface, this one seems to be set up more like the Xbox Live interface without being Live. As an added bonus Playstation includes a code to redeem 1 month of free Playstation Plus (required for PS4). So I began to play Madden 25 (a must have) and I noticed the graphics were second to none, better than 360...really. The character animations made me think I was looking at a real live NFL game on TV. So after playing Madden 25, NBA 2K 14 and Assassins Creed IV Black Flag, I was thoroughly convinced that this system was an excellent choice for me. The one thing I have to get used to is the controller; I really like the dual shock 4 controller over it's predecessor the dual shock 3. It's larger and wider, the handles have better grip for sweaty hands, I also think the dual shock 4 is more comfortable in the players hands (much lighter), it's not heavy like the Xbox 360 controller...good controller but heavier.Overall, I can't compare this console to it's direct competition (Xbox One) yet because I haven't had the pleasure of purchasing one thus far; but compared to the PS3, Sony has done a wonderful job of not repeating the mistakes of the PS3 console at launch. If your a hardcore gamer like myself you will probably buy both consoles in due time, I will. The Sony Playstation 4 console comes highly recommended from me; one thing I think is an edge over the Xbox One is that PS4 has a removable 500 GB HD and the One does not. This is important to know because the PS4 games require a lot of HD space, for example NBA 2k 14 uses about 50 GB of Hard Drive space, which is a lot for one game.To sum it all up, which ever system you decide to buy, I don't think you'll be disappointed especially with the PS4. Thank you for your time.

  My brother and I both purchased a PS4 back in June and finally recieved it about a week ago. So far I have enjoyed everything about it. I a few hours worth of games and have had a great experience so far.  The pros:-Small Size, I expected it to be much bigger and take up more room, but boy was I wrong. The size is perfect.-Excellent graphics. I have been playing on a high def 50+ inch screen and have seen nothing but perfection. It was more than I expected. I figured I would have some fps issues and the like but nothing so far.-Excellent controller...the battery life has been lasting for quite awhile before needing recharged, I managed to grab a second controller for a friend to play along with me and both have been working very well. The controller also feels very durable and high quality. Not to mention I love the light bar that is build in. I personally can't wait for it to be implemented in more games (the eye that is)-Dashboard software os or whatever it's called now is very nice and easy to navigate through. I personally did not like the layout of the ps3's, they managed to change it enough to where I truly like it.  The cons...-The PS4 charging cable for the controller was kind of short. I had the controller built in battery ran out of juice during some gameplay and since I was on a massive screen I didn't want to keep playing while it was plugged in, wayyyy too close to the screen for comfort had I otherwise.-Dust Magnet, maybe I don't clean my apartment enough I don't know, but man it collected some heavy dust all over it. If you are in a similar situation keep a can of air nearby to keep it looking perfect :D-only 2 usb ports, I am unaware if we can get away with attaching a USB hub, but I felt 3-4 would have been preferred.Overall a very solid system and I am 100% satisfied with my purchase. I hope they release more soon so that everyone has an opportunity to get their hands on it.

    The Best Console to Date....
  
",4.0,G.M,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2014","









  
  
    
  Full Disclaimer, own Xbox one: I have owned every single PlayStation Consoles, and this is by far the best Gaming console sony has made. The gaming graphic is superb; I  enjoy the high quality Sony provided us. The new DualShock controller fits great in one's hand, and it is very comfortable and the touchpad works all right, but I feel it revolting sometimes. I enjoy playing Madden 25, and Call of Duty: Ghosts. The graphic performance is exquisite, very fast with lack of noise, which makes gaming so enjoyable. Gamers no longer have to worry about consoles overheating due to gameplay. Some people are complaining about the hard drive sound; however, my current console does not experience that issue. The UI works great and is very fast and responsive. Something I enjoy using is DLNA, with multiple devices and it is a not sure why sony did not include it, maybe they will since its software related, but only time will tell. The 3.5mm jack works awesomely with most pair of headphones. The PlayStation Network is gradually improving, and I believe over time it will transcend pass the Xbox Gaming Network. An innovation Sony must capture if they want to become the number one gaming system, would be the integration of the PlayStation Vita's in the ecosystem, so its interacting as one collective unit. Downloanding using this current system works exceptional well. Sony PS4 is for gamers, and I am glad I purchased the day one edition. PS4 is a top notch gaming console and for sony. Another selling point for the PS4 is the dedicated gaming graphics, which will continue its evolving process til Full 1080p 60FPS multi gaming becomes a reality. Currently, most games are running on 720p 60 FPS, I believe there are one two games that are running on 1080p 60 FPS on single player, Killzone Shadow, which is very disappointing, case and point for the 4stars review. I am looking forward to  exciting Sony exclusive games titles that should be coming out in the coming months.

  I LOVE my PS4. The exclusives are great, and as of now the OS has been updated finally to use external hard drives and folder sorting of installed applications. My only serious complaint with the system is the lack of available USB ports. Once you steal one for an external hard drive, you only have one left. Definitely necessitates the need for a USB hub for the system.

  Was nervous when I picked this up from the local UPS location, all I kept thinking about was getting a D.O.A system. I got home carefully connected to my t.v., which was very fast and simple. I got everything set up on the network, etc.. everything seems to be working fine so far. The UI is pretty plain and easy to use, as well as navigating the settings. I'm only giving 4 stars due to the lack of games out at the moment, but the machine itself has a ton of potential. I ordered mine @ 12:01 a.m. Friday morning and had it in my hands today, mine came from the Chattanooga,TN location and was fine. Just an FYI for those trying to pin point where the defective systems are coming from.

    Awesome Console with a Bright Future
  
",5.0,AshleyV,"Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2013","









  
  
    
  The PS4 has really exceeded my expectations and those were very high.  I've owned all the consoles at launch since I was a child and got a NES which wasn't at launch but I was really young.  This console is a lot better compared to the 360 and PS3 launch and I'm enjoying the new social features and UIThe controller is incredible and a massive improvement over the dualshock 3 which I hated in almost every way.  The controller is a lot more comfortable to hold, has real triggers for R2 and L2, and the new thumb sticks are excellent.  The battery life seems shorter than other wireless controllers but it's nothing that will hold back from the experience. I'd say its equal to the 360 controller which is my favorite controller in console gaming history.The console itself is small and aesthetically pleasing which is surprising because launch consoles are usually enormous and hideous.  It is quiet and I updated the hard drive to a 1 TB hybrid drive with ease.  I installed the day 1 update from a memory stick with no problems and haven't looked back.I own four launch games Knack, Killzone, BF4, and AC 4.  I have played lots of knack which is surprising as after reading reviews I almost cancelled my pre-order.  Killzone is incredible as well and I'm loving the multiplayer portion.  I have played BF4 and was impressed but it needs further patching.  I have yet to play AC 4 because I hated AC 3 but decided to get Black Flag as my free game in the buy 2 get 1 free promotion.The UI is clean and extremely fast and responsive.  I've used party chat and the provided headset isn't bad for simple chatting purposes.Overall this console is great and it has a bright future.  It may not have the games that make you buy it instantly but there are a lot of games on the horizon.  You won't be disappointed!

",4.0,Joosby C.,"Reviewed in the United States January 22, 2014","









  
  
    
  I'm probably a xbox homer so coming from me, it's a big statement but the ps4 was the better launch console.  it was a more complete experience out of the box, you got what you expected, a video game console.  Performance wise, it's games perform better.  I thought xbox one had the better exclusive lineup by far, I thought forza was the best launch title either system, the ps4 launch lineup as far as exclusives go was laughable.  But in the end, the games they shared, they either looked the same or better on the ps4.  Kinect was more annoying then it should be so lack of a similar feature on the ps4 wasn't a big deal.  the vita remote play feature is a big plus for me, works very well.

  Ive grown up on Playstation. System is great. can't wait two years from now once the game designers get some experience to the new system and are able to develop some truly amazing games.  The new UI takes a little getting used to. There is only 2 usb ports. No DLNA support (no streaming movies to the ps4 from your pc for viewing on your TV)The new controller design is nice, the ps4 system itself looks good. doesn't get too hot or too loud. solid console.  maybe once i get more ownership and wear and tear out of this and see what games are developed in the future, i might be willing to upgrade to 5 stars.

  Finally the PS4 has arrived and we are able to embark on the next-gen of console gaming.Pros:+Controller(DualShock 4) is a definite upgrade which feels better in every way than it's predecessors.  The touch screen/speaker adds a bit to the gaming experience.+System Design: Sleek and small.  It's surprising how they managed to make this system the size it is.+Interface: Smooth and easy to use+Media Sharing: Save screenshots/videos at the touch of the button in addition to live streaming.Cons:- DVD/Blu-Ray Playback: As it stands now the Playback of movies isn't as good as the PS3.  This will probably change in time and once they release a separate movie remote this will not be an issue.Overall:PS4 is a nice step forward as a mighty powerhouse for gaming.  I am definitely happy with my purchase and I look forward to all the PS4 games to come out in the future.

    Day One Buyer Finally Comes Back to Review
  
",5.0,An NY Buyer,"Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2013","









  
  
    
  I did what most people who buy a product that works do; used the product and never really looked back.  That's probably why there are less positive reviews for the Playstation 4 than you'd expect.There are a ton of reviews on the web already, so I'll try and keep this one short.Pros -Great hardware, best of this new generation under the hood.  8 GB of GDDR5 RAM and an easy architecture for developers to work with.  Xbox One's 8 GB of DDR3 are close, but not quite.  We've already seen some multiplatform games take advantage of this and that will only continue as the generation goes on.  First party titles will benefit even more, and Sony has some great studios under contract.Excellent controller with a built in battery for recharging.  Improved L2 and R2 shoulder buttons and analog sticks.  Comfortable.Streaming works well and is very easy to do.  You either log into your account or make one, then hit the share button and start broadcasting. That's it.User Interface is clean and intuitive.  Switching between applications is wonderfully fast.Warframe, a free-to-play that is really ""free to play"".Cons -Battery life for the controller is maybe 8 hours, and it takes two hours to fully recharge.  You can play while the controller is charging of course, but the charging wire is short.Several features of the console aren't available at launch.  mp3 support, dlna support(streaming), bluetooth support for various headsets,  These are all getting patched in later, but if you really enjoy those you might want to wait for confirmation of exactly when they're coming.If you're not gung-ho about FPS games, the majority of ""system sellers"" don't apply to you.  Battlefield 4, Killzone: Shadow Fall, Call of Duty: Ghosts,  With that said, there really aren't any launch day exclusives that match the hype of Xbox One's Killer Instinct, Dead Rising 3, or Forza 5.  Warframe is awesome and Resogun is fun, but they are not necessarily ""system sellers"".

  The PS4 I purchased has operated perfectly so far.. The system is far superior to the previous ps3 system. it is a lot faster, and so much easier to use.. i also like how you can use multiple things at once and easily access them via the center PS button on the controller- i like being able to play music unlimited as I am playing games or doing other things.. I'm just waiting until they sell enough systems so there is financial incentive for game developers to put all their talents into PS4/xbox1 games..right now there are 100 million ps3/xbox systems and maybe 10 percent of that # of the new systems.. so they obviously won't sell as many games on the new systems. maybe in a year or 2 we will start seeing amazing games. only new game i want to see is watchdogs, which, to be honest, looks like grand theft auto with hacking

    THE definitive console this generation, but could be better
  
",4.0,nonja121,"Reviewed in the United States March 31, 2015","









  
  
    
  TL:DR: This is the definitive console for this generation, but it could be better. If you're not set on buying a PS4 right this instant, I'd wait for a Slim model.Comparisons to the Xbox One abound on the Internet, so I'm going to just list my own pros and cons. Hope this helps you.Pros:-- Compatibility with a wide variety of devices and peripherals:The PS4 is compatible with a number of different, third-party accessories and devices via USB and Bluetooth, and the Dualshock's audio out jack is a standard 3.5mm jack compatible with any stereo headphone (which is a godsend when compared to the Xbox One). This is great because it does not shoehorn you into purchasing overpriced ""gamer"" peripherals (Astro, Turtle Beach, etc) or poor-quality first-person addons like the Xbox One Chat Adaptor. My personal setup uses a Blue Snowball iCE USB Mic and a pair of V-Moda XS stereo headphones, and I plan to pair it with my Bluetooth keyboard.--Functional Party Chat:Party chat on Xbox One is well-known for functioning poorly, dropping party members or failing to connect party members at random. The PS4's party chat just works. Plain and simple.--SpotifyThe PS4 just recently partnered with Spotify, and the app hit as of last night. This is a killer app for me, as it allows me to play my own music while I play games. Nothing on Xbox One comes close to this.However, the PS4 could be improved in a couple of areas, at least in terms of hardware...---Not enough USB portsSo, I'm a gadget guy. I like being able to hook up various gadgets to my devices. So I'm somewhat disappointed with the shortage of USB ports on the PS4. With a USB mic using up one port and the Dualshock's charger cable using up the other half the time, I find myself wishing I had one or two more USB ports for a USB stick or a headphone amp (more on that in a second).---Subpar audio out of the Dualshock audio port and lack of a separate mic in portI know that maybe I'm expecting too much out of the Dualshock, but I feel like the audio out of the stereo headphone port is somewhat lacking. Comparing this to the audio from my speakers, I can't help but think that either the wireless connection between the Dualshock and the PS4 isn't sufficient to support good-quality audio, or the port isn't outputting enough power to properly drive my headphones. In addition, I wish there was a separate mic jack so I could use an Antlion ModMic.---No analog output (stereo or RCA) for audioI know that this probably won't affect many people, but I do wish that the PS4 supported analog audio output via RCA or even just a 1/8"" stereo jack. I've seen a number of people online become frustrated trying to hook their PS4s to older PC monitors without headphone jacks. Personally, I'm using old computer speakers on my PS4, and it would have been nice to be able to plug the speakers directly into the PS4 instead of my monitor. In addition, since I primarily play wearing stereo headphones, I would have liked RCA compatibility so I could hook these up to a powered headphone amp. Instead, the only audio options we have are HDMI, TOSLINK optical, or Bluetooth wireless.

    The most Amazing Video Game Experience Coming From An Xbox Fanboy
  
",5.0,Mom of 3,"Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2013","









  
  
    
  I ordered my counsel from amazon at the midnight release.  I received my console that following monday and have played it non stop.  The system and the UI work so flawlessly together.  The next gen experience is here and is amazing.  over the past 8 years I had an xbox 360 and I loved it to death.  However, in my opinion, the ps4 trumps the xbox one and all other counsels out there.  The graphics in the ps4 are so amazing that when you play on anything else the graphics look awful.  The ps4 also has the best hardware and specs of any counsel to date.  This means that video game companies can make games with much better graphics for the ps4 than the xbox one.  I have also had absolutely no problems with my counsel.  The future of gaming is bright!  Buy a PS4 you will not regret it.

  Admittedly I still don't have many games for this system yet other than freebie downloads off PSN. I do have Assassins Creed Black Flag for it though and the gameplay in itself for that takes some getting used to with the new controller ^_^;; The system is definitely an upgrade from the PS3. Speed, download time, functionality is all improved. Don't get me wrong I love the PS3 beyond belief. The PS4 is a perfect companion for it and for any fan of PlayStation. The buttons are very touch sensitive which is great because they're rather tiny on the console for appearance purposes.The controller is greatly more comfortable to handle than the previous Dualshock's, but trust me the touchpad takes some getting used to especially when the new games all have it integrated into gameplay in some form or another. Take your time making sure you know what it's used for.

  I bought two of these!  BOTH systems are running great, they are NOT loud (some people are reporting that the fan is very loud, but personally I have not experienced this except at startup for about 2 seconds, which is NORMAL, your PC probably does the same thing), they are running flawlessly, and on the first two days, between me, my friends, and my son, each of them probably ran about 36 hours STRAIGHT!  There WERE a few problems with PSN being over-utilized and having some issues (more people logging on than the servers could handle), but that's fixed and everything is AWESOME!!!!!!  I love these systems, will buy another for my girlfriend for x-mas.  So far, we have played and beaten Knack, COD Ghosts, Killzone Shadowfall, and Contrast (couldn't really get into Warframe (would be great as a single player campaign, BUT that's not available, only online multiplayer).  I like the old PS3 XMB UI over the new UI, but that doesn't take away from the FUNCTION of the system.  The voice commands work good, but took my 12 year old a little while to learn how to command it correctly, you have to tell it step by step how to do something (Playstation...Knack.....Start; instead he was trying Playstation...start Knack, and it wouldn't work).  The playroom is cool as hell, for about 3 minutes, then it will probably never get used again other than to show your friends or family.  The face detection is flawless, it automatically logs in whoever is in front of it at startup, you can change the login later if someone else wants to play (more than one person can be logged in at a time),  All in all I AM VERY HAPPY with the PS4(s), everyone I know is happy with them who have bought them, and none of us have had any failures yet (other than the PSN being down for a little here and there in the beginning, but that's not the PS4 itself)!  Its a beautiful system, and works flawlessly, you will not be disappointed with this addition to your living room!  (And you CAN verify that I actually purchased these in my histories on Amazon)

The ps4s new controller feels quite nice in my hands over the ps3 controller.Dont be fooled the new console is flawed by my standard the ps3 has the ability to play movies /video files from a flashdrive the ps4 wont identify that there is a gig stick plugged into the console.To make things worst I was expecting many of the games on the psnetwork to run on the ps4 but not just yet.Overall I am very happy with my purchase but if it wasn't for the games due out soon with the better graphix of next gen technology I would have waited 1 year to buy the system.I do for see many great updates for the ps4 in the future but having to wait is not fun.

I'm very happy with it, graphics are great and the free games are entertaining.I'm planning on getting an xbox one after its price drops and it has a larger library of great games, but for now I'm all about the ps4, you just can't beat it.

  This was the only Eighth generation console that I did not have. I got the Wii U and Xbox One at launch and all three are great and offer something different to offer. The PS4 is very fast and quiet. The Setup was very simple and so far (knocking on wood) I have had zero issues with it. The new controller is a great upgrade from the Dualshock 3. My only complaints about it which are minor is not being able to turn off the light on the top of the controller really drains the battery, and the rubber on the joysticks feels fragile. There have also been a lot of reports of the rubber wearing down and cracking on the joysticks. I prefer using FPS Freeks from Kontrol Freek so this should not be an issue. I ordered two sets made for the PS4 the CQC Signature putting one each on the left stick of my controllers and the FPS Ultra putting one each on the right sticks and it is a nice setup. I completed Killzone Shadow Fall and the graphics looked amazing. There are not a lot of games out for it right now, but it did only launch 4 months ago today. I am looking forward to playing inFAMOUS Second Son on the 21st and Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes on the 18th. The Remote Play from the PSVita works very good as well and is a nice addition if you own a PSVita. So yeah so far so good and I am looking forward to the upcoming exclusives and two thumbs up!

  It's been a great upgrade so far. System menus are clean and fast, and with the new update I can use my PS3 headset. CoD and battlefield where definitely worth the PS3-PS4 conversion. Assassins Creed looks very nice on the PS4, but if you've beaten the PS3 version and don't play multiplayer, it's not worth an upgrade. Looking forward to more games being released later in the year.

   Was said to be in “very good” condition. Product arrived, I plugged it into my tv, and the console started making noises as soon as I turned it on. I inserted many game discs and none of them would read, another problem was the software itself. I tried updating the console to the latest firmware, but it kept giving me an error message. I tried both methods (via Internet and USB) but none worked. Better off buying a PS4 slim. I gave it 3 stars because the seller was nice about giving me my refund.

The controller's battery do not last as much , as the one in the PS3 controller. This console has a long way ahead , and I'm looking to see its progress  ! Can't wait for the next ""Naughty dog"", ""Santa Monica"" and ""Quantic Dream"" games ! TO unleash the graphic to its full potential , and to get a native 1080p  resolution with all details maxed to match the PS4 hardware performance ! I used to have both PS3 and XBOX 360 consoled , but sold them to get true 1080p on my 150"" projector screen. At this image size , resolution must be the highest one accepted by your hardware. I'll get XBOX one , but not until they get rid of the power brick and reduce the size and weight to the PS4 level ! However design the Microsoft next generation console , needs replacement ! External power supply, DDR3, old VHS design and footprint? Really ?

  Console arrived a lot earlier in the day than i am used to, but thats the only plus I will give the shipping team. Like others have said, my ps4 was placed inside a box with air bags on top of it. Most damage is going to happen on the bottom of the box, conveyors, loading and unloading will tear the cases up very quickly. My unit was not damaged and I have been enjoying it.  I do wish there was a better lineup of launch titles for the ps4. I bought Shadow fall, COD and BF4. I am disappointed  with shadow fall because I loved killzone mercenary. COD is cod, nothing new. BF4 I've played very little because i need a friend to back me up and none of my friends bought a ps4,  They are too busy with GTA5 to make the jump.  Console is very quiet and doesn't seem to get very hot. Seen some videos on some shoddy thermal paste and it makes me wonder how mine is inside. i build pcs for gaming and thermal paste is very important to the longevity of the cpu. Also seeing that massive fan and the way it dissipates heat from the apu is a good thing. My pc can trounce my ps4, but it is about 10 times the size and only 2 friends play pc games.  Overall I am very happy with my purchase and believe I will enjoy my ps4 for many years to come.

  This system is the best value for money right now if you are a gamer. The console is the most technicallly capable console, yet it only cost $399 (still expensive, but cheaper than a gaming PC and other comparable gaming consoles). Also with a PS Plus subscription you get access to free games, many of which are actually worth playing. Some cons to the system are that gaming is pretty much all it does. Gaming and Media streaming apps such as Netflix, Hulu, etc. It can play blurays, but I don't think it can play audio cds at this time (which is strange and hopefully will be  added soon). I recommend the system if you primary purpose for buying it is to play games.

    Back to Basics
  
",5.0,Omnistalgic,"Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2014","









  
  
    
  Well for Sony's latest iteration of Playstation, seems they've decided to go back to the PS2 form factor of sleek jet-black and blue LED light. Very sleek looking console all around and not as big as you might imagine. Although a top-shelf PC outclasses it, PS4 is the most powerful gaming console on the market, and as we get closer to realism in our gaming graphics, I think the decision to use PC architecture and not use expensive parts (like PS3) did will pay off for Sony.Controller is much improved, I'm sure you can find in-dept analysis elsewhere, but it really feels great. Nice improvement to triggers, comfort, and most of the analogs. Little larger than DS3, but overall, not a single thing is lacking in comparison. Touchpad is useful as well, although I would have liked a larger surface to swipe along, it does it's job well enough.Now for what matters most--the Games! Infamous, Ground Zeroes, Final Fantasy 14 are my favorite games for the system so far, but be assured, if you aren't a ""hardcore"" gamer, PS4 is pretty awesome out of the box with PS+ and free titles to try out. Warframe being one of the better examples of the free-to-play model done right, and PS+ is filled with goodies already like Don't Starve, Towerfall Ascension, Resogun, and Mercenary Kings. Knack is also a nice old school title that's got that ""cheap"" hard factor to it, but brings a certain level of nostalgia that's hard to deny. Overall, it's one of the best launches I've ever been a part of. No stand out classic like N64 launch with Mario 64, but everything early on has been good to great, with Infamous topping the list in just over 5 months of PS4 being available. I really feel good about this one. Sony's marketing and messaging has been spot on with gamers, they are gathering indy guys up to the platform, and really, that's where a lot of amazing experiences is coming from. It really does feel like the Renaissance of gaming and developers going back to basics with old school designs, and fresh perspectives and stories.People get into game! There's stories out there like The Last of Us or Gone Home that are just as good as movies we spend $30 to see just once. Support this medium, check out games, and sit down with one for a few hours. This is no longer a children and ""geek"" hobby. Games are really beginning to reinvent themselves, with some truly touching stories that you feel more connected to since you are a ""player"" in that world. It's an entertainment industry unlike anything else, and short mobile games (while tons of fun) just don't give you the full spectrum of gaming. It's my favorite past time, even beating out reading, sports, and running. PS4 is a good well-rounded platform for any new comers looking into gaming.ProsPS+ You pay $50 a year (or cheaper if you can fine deals) and you get free games every month! The best value right now is still on PS3 (Over 150 games now) but it's great on PS4 as well and will get better. One of the best things Sony did this generation of gaming.Controller-Huge improvement and feels nice in handSoftware-Great catalog of games already when new systems usually are pretty sparse on content in the beginning. Infamous/Watchdogs/The Order/Dragon Age are my potential big hitters for this year, but honestly, I'm having a lot of fun with the smaller, more personal titles. It really is going back to basics.Community--PS4 quickly seems to be becoming the goto console for gamers. I think it may end up being this generation's ""Live"" where all your friends are on PS4, not Xbox, meaning community titles like Street Fighter or Call of Duty/Battlefield with have more active communities on PS4. We'll see, but so far, gamers are choosing PS4 as the machine of choice.Cons-OS (Operating system)  is barebones and not much customization is available-Many of the cool features like Pause/Resume, Controlling your friends game through the network, and PS now and Sony's IPTV which lets you stream games, movies/shows and Live TV are not available yet.-Best studio's titles are still a ways off (Gran Turismo, Uncharted, God of War, Little Big Planet) and Sony's is being very quite on what there in-house guys are doing. Likely won't be updated until E3.

  Just a heads up, I own both this and the xbox one, along with the 360 and ps3.The system is slick, the visuals are great. Controller is still not as good as the xbox controller, but I do think they went in the right direction. It's a plus that they decided to keep an internal battery in the controller. I hope more games start to use the little touch pad but we'll see.Have had this system since launch and I was lucky to be one of the ones that did not have a disc drive problem. To be honest there hasn't been too many exclusives for this system. Second son was pretty good but I wouldn't consider it a system seller. But the few games that I have played have looked GREAT. I don't think there's much of a jump from ps3 to ps4 as there was from ps2 to ps3, but that should change once developers start trying to get everything they can out of the system.Price is very good at 400, one of the reasons I think its outselling the xbox one right now.If you plan on only getting one system the only thing I can tell you is that if you were a ps3 fan, go ahead and keep rolling with sony.

  I bought this for our sons, 14 and 17, who are very good, sweet boys who earned this PS4 by doing lots of chores, including digging their mom a french drain for her kitchen gray water.We have had every version of the Playstation console since the first one came out, when our older kids were young. I honestly didn't think there would be that much of an improvement over PS3 and, considering the recent investment in PS3 games, I was reluctant to purchase a new console. However, the graphics, load time, and functionality really are a step up from the PS3. And I say that as a mostly idle observer who rarely uses the PS4 for anything except accessing my Plex server. The kids are definitely thrilled with the PS4 whenever they can wrench the controller from their father's grasp.As far as issues, there haven't been any. With all the prior Playstation incarnations their have been occasional glitches, overheating, and hanging games--which I admit back in the day was probably from us soldering and modding them. We didn't mod the PS3, but it still had a habit of hanging. So far this console has run as smooth as butter. As the first stop for tech support and complaints in the house I really appreciate that stability.If you are thinking about getting this for your kids, and balking at the prospect of a subscription to Playstation Plus, I did too. I felt like, between the cost of the console and games, I had already laid out enough money. However, my husband needed it to play Destiny so he bought it and I found out that you can  download some pretty neat free games and games that aren't available on disk, and you can get discounts on games you buy through the Plus service. It is one of the few subscriptions I haven't ultimately regretted and actually has added value to the PS4.

  So far so good. Love this thing. Works super fast and is awesome. I love the PS4. Games are expensive as usual, and the servers on BF4 aren't much better even after having to pay the yearly fees. But it is still a great system.UPDATE*****************************Let me clarify. Playstation Plus ($50 per year) is now required for multi-player content. It was free before, which was nice. Now we are told that they will charge so that they can boost their network infrastructure.Shuhei Yoshida said:""The main pillar for the PS4 will be online play. We're developing many new ways to play and connect which requires a large investment of resources. Considering the cost, to try to keep such a service free and consequently lower the quality would be absurd. We decided that if that's the case, then it would be better to receive proper payment and continue to offer a good service.""Yes the BF4 servers are their own issues with EA. BUT their servers are using the PS Network, that is supposed to get improved.I have also had lag and problems with Killzone, which is a Sony game. And my internet connection is definitely not the problem (20down/5up). Talk to anyone, lag is still an issue. You cannot find a single player who doesn't get bothered by lag.That all said, I still LOVE the PS4. It is definitely quicker and a great value. I wish it would have been a higher leap of quality. When the PS3 came out, it was extremely powerful compared to other PC's and devices of its time. The PS4 is barely on par to today's devices at only 1.84 Teraflops. Although the Xbox One's GPU offers only 1.32 Teraflops.It will be fascinating to see how new games look as they begin to fully utilize the PS4 though.

  controller is better, definitely better graphically, that party system is nice, remote play is fantastic if you have a friend you want to show a game from across the country, but maybe less so if you live in the same city. but this far along still lacks some features of the ps3, and it's simple things like sort app's by favorites and connecting a wide variety of bluetooth head sets or completing install updates in power save mode. and lastly hdd is more limited than i would like. comes with a 500 gb hdd but 1 tb drives are cheap (only $20 more than what they come with or $30 more for a faster 1 TB hdd or $45 more 2 tb drive) and after saves, updates, dlc, and the video capture/share mode that you can't disable to free up those resources after 6-7 games you have to start making choices on what to save and what you want to reinstall next time you choose to play it. the standard hdd it comes with just isn't enough. i like it, but i wanted to like it more and the worst thing is i know exactly why.but really at the end of the day the most important thing is what your friends play, because that means at least as much as all this, so ask what they have and then get that too.

",4.0,Weekend Roady,"Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2013","









  
  
    
  I jumped into the ""next-gen"" with some hesitation. I preordered the PS4 within the first hour of availability and held onto it, despite some back and forth, until it was released. Needless to say, I'm mostly happy with the purchase - though I know it will only be more valuable to me over time.Let's start with the drawbacks...Multimedia (lack thereof). The PS4 is a gamer's system in a day and age where the newest tech gadgets try to cater to everyone's cravings. If you are used to the Xbox 360 and having rather robust multimedia offerings at your fingertips, the relatively bland front-end of the PS4 and it's slim offerings of apps/software (carried over from the PS3) will feel a bit underwhelming.You are going to run out of space soon. The 500 GB drive will be under heavy demand as you amass your PS4 library. Even physical copies of games will need massive installs (NBA 2K14 took a healthy 45 GB worth of space after a long install). Even swapping out a HD won't help you all that much in the long run. If you plan on gaming with this rig for the next 5-10 years, you will likely threaten to go over 1 TB worth of DLC, updates and games. This is a problem that both next-gen consoles face going forward.The next-gen leap isn't all that spectacular...yet. Take a look at NBA 2K14 and FIFA 14. Nice and smooth, a quality ""upgrade"" to the current-gen offering, but hardly what you would expect from a generation leap - however, those two games represent the largest graphical leap of any of the launch games. Truth be told, it will get a lot better, faster, but for now, the offerings are mostly glossed-over ports. It will be interesting to see how much this ""leap"" evolves in the next couple years.With that out of the way, I'm very happy with my PS4 ""upgrade"". A few months ago I sold my PS3 in anticipation while holding onto the Xbox 360. The PS4 feels like the perfect gaming machine. It's a sleek design, from the console itself right down to the awesome Dual Shock 4 - which could easily be the best gaming controller ever created. After all the installs/etc (hey, next-gen is just going to have that kinda stuff, we'll have to deal with it) it's generally very easy to get right into a game. PS Plus is a very nice deal going forward and provides a steady diet of great ""free"" games for the nominal yearly fee. Out of the gate there are plenty of very solid games at launch (despite not being all that much better than the current-gen counterparts as mentioned before) with a community that is growing at a rapid rate - there is no worry that people won't be buying into the next-gen at least.The real key is this. For $100 less than the competition you still get a very powerful gaming machine that lacks some multimedia aspects and the motion/voice recognition abilities (which you can still gain with the PS4 Eye if you want that stuff). Other than that, both the PS4 and Xbox One generally will offer the same types of experience at a raw gaming level. You certainly can't go wrong with the PS4 if you are just choosing one console going forward - it's already gained a strong share of the market at this early stage and seems to be a very safe investment for the long term (as it essentially won the ""public opinion"" war in the lead-up to launch).

I though that it had the ability to play old gen titles, and just dissapointed me there as well. No it will not run any ps1 games and no you cannot purchase any on the store. You can stream certain games however you need a subscription which is completely different from the online subscription you already pay for if you choose to.

Many great companions, much more memorable characters, crisp graphics, a solid main quest, plenty of factions, and an immense map to wander.There is also an unprecedented building system that lets you create or enhance wasteland settlements wall by wall, piece by piece, furniture, power, everything all from core scavenged materials. You can settle them with people and establish trade routes. It's a big post nuclear 1950s style future epic that plays for hundreds of hours and is filled with creative Hotspot and quirky humor. You simply require this game.

  I was a little hesitant going into this, expecting a more or less PS3 with more powerful hardware.  After spending about 10 hours on it over the weekend, I must say that I am very impressed.  The system is quick, powerful, and easy to use.  A lot of the little features here and there are well polished and awesome (face recognition log in system is very cool).Thus far I've played most of the free games available to PS+ members and the free to play titles on the system (Warframe, Blacklight, etc).  They look good and operate well.  The streaming feed service via Twitch & Ustream works great.  The friends system works much better vs PS3.  Once DLNA is patched into the system, I'll be set.  The camera is pretty cool too and seems like a worth while accessory to pick up if you want to utilize everything the ps3 can offer.I've got Killzone on order so that should show up soon, looking forward to that.

  I picked this up and immediately upgraded COD - Ghosts to play on it to see the difference between it and the PS3.  The graphics seem sharper and the load times seem better.I do not like the fact you must now purchase Playstation Plus to play online games, but at least you get a free game a month with that service.  The online store is easy to navigate, but the game selection is still fairly limited.I found a free to play game Warframe in the store and have found that to be very enjoyable.  Overall I am happy with my purchase.

  I've put the system through a major stress test and everything works.  The system works and is fully functional.  OS is quick and responsive.  Games install and load quickly.  Being able to install things in the background is nice.  It's also on the quieter side.Current issues (supposedly fixed in a future update):No Bluray 3D SupportNo MP3 SupportNo ability for custom soundtrackCurrent issues outside of firmware:No official Remote (App works great for navigating OS, but doesn't work for Amazon Prime, at least the Netflix app works to navigate Netflix via your phone)I will update my review as I have had more time with the system.  No quirks or crashes yet.I do want to comment on Amazon's packaging.  They put the PS4 in a big box..  Put a couple bubble bags over it. Nothing was tight and nothing would of been protected.  Only one side had a few bubble bags, even those were just lazily placed on top and didn't fill the box on the one side they were on.

  I've been keeping up with news on the next gen and still I find stuff on this beast of a console that I never heard of. There isn't a lot of games and I wasn't going to get it this early but I sold my Wii and wanted to upgrade so I didn't have to buy my games all at once. The Wii hit my wallet pretty hard last gen with the release windows being so close together. But this gen I'm going to get the ones I really want and enjoy it at the same time with other gamers. So far I really love this system.PROS:-Smooth Online-Nice controller with improved 6-axis controls-Fast loading times-All TV media is available [Hulu, Netflix, etc.]-Day One patch isn't big/doesn't take a lot of time-Easy setup [Physical and software]-Easy to navigate through menus-Can record and take a screenshot of gameplay and share it-Can download apps and games while in standbyCons:-Not many games available right now.

    Very Happy Amazon Verified PS4 Owner
  
",5.0,Bill B.,"Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2013","









  
  
    
  All i have to say is pay attention to the Amazon verified purchases of the PS4, not the reviews by the trolls. Sony has reported a 1% failure rate, which is to be expected with any new electronic. I've had my PS4 for one week now and i must say, i'm impressed. The redesign of the Dualshock controller was much needed and appreciated. The Dualshock 4 controller has finally gotten it all correct. Your fingers finally line up with the L2 and R2 buttons, unlike previous controllers, which they seemed to line up with L1 and R1 instead. New to Sony's controller is and added speaker. The speaker comes into play in both games i've played so far, Resogun (Playstation Plus Awesome Shooter Freebie) and Killzone: Shadow Fall. In Killzone, recordings and such that you find in game are heard through the speaker, making it much easier to hear what is on the tapes. In Resogun, the stage announcer is heard through the speaker. I'm sure as the generation goes along, the speaker will come into play quite a bit in PS4 games. Sony also added a light to the back of the controller, which atleast in Killzone, changes color as you get close to death and such. A different color also will be displayed for each controller, when playing multiplayer games locally with friends. This is a nice added feature as well, for those times you take a break, and all sit your controllers down together. The different colors make it possible to know which is yours, even from across the room. The PS4 console itself is much smaller than i expected it to be, and that's a good thing. Good things come in small packages they say, and this is true for the PS4 as well. I personally like the redesign of the XMB. It in itself is nothing groundbreaking, but it is much more simplified, and makes it way quicker to switch between the different catagories. The PS4 graphics, atleast for Killzone, have a noticeable difference as well. The textures are much smoother, due to the full 1080 P, which only the PS4 does, so far this generation. I really can't wait to see what game developers will do with the power capabilities of the PS4. I especially can't wait to see what Naughty Dog will do with Uncharted 4. I don't want to leave out Resogun, which is available on the PS4 online store ($14.99 For The Normal Price, Or Free For Playstation Plus Subscribers), as it in itself is a pretty awesome shooter. It will surely keep you occupied for many hours, if you indeed are a shooter fan. The graphics are a next gen custom, update of the classic style. Resogun was made by the same people that brought us Super Stardust HD on the PS3. In closing, read the true reviews on here, not the Xbox fanboy ones, which are just there to confuse you. In the end, read the reviews, specs, and capabilities, and make your own decision. There's a GOOD  reason that Gamestop is now reporting over 2.3 Million people are on a waiting list for the PS4, buy one and find out that reason

  I was an Xbox 360 owner without any real fervent advocacy for one system or the other. Honestly, I find it hard to care about the debate about which system is better blah blah blah graphics and who cares about what games are ""better"". The really good titles will be available on both, and they both offer similar services.But Microsoft messed up. Big time. I almost bought the PS4 out of spite for the Xbone. An immature impulse, I know. But I had the choice of one or the other and technology only moves one way, so I couldn't resist.Immaturity aside, if that's even possible, I am pleased with the PS4. It's graphics are amazing and the new controller is responsive and balanced. As far as streaming, it's faster than my Google chromecast and the apple TV my SO has. And you DON'T NEED the PS plus network to gain access to the internet. That last bit along should be enough to convince you. I do sign up for the PSN now, only because AWESOMENAUTS, but I don't mind the free games I get every month either.I guess I've become a Sony fanboy since owning this device, insofar as my attention span will allow. Still, I think anyone who looks at the numbers and the cost-benefit of each system will make the same choice. It's the better selling system for good reasons. 10/10 will recommend again.

  Why i chose 5 stars:  The console came on time, unopened, and it functions perfectly.  I feel for the people that got the ""Dead on Arrival"" models - that's terrible.  Luckily, I did not get one of these.Pros:- The controller gets the ""most improved"" award.  Awesome.  the joysticks have less movement range but greater resistance, allowing for the system to interpret smaller movements as greater distances even though they don't move as far.  Really helps with precision.  Ever try to whip around and aim at someone but you move too far?  it's easier to control now.- Easy to switch between games and other apps.  You can download while playing/watching other apps and games now, so this is a great improvement as well.- All digital.  I don't need to go to a gamestop and have some smelly turd try and sell me a strategy guide.  EVER AGAIN.- Crisp graphics, native 1080P.  I dont have an Xbox thus cannot compare, but I've been told it only has 720P.- Can download a plethora of games at once.  Need to update one while playing one, or update two at once? No problem.Cons (nothing major!)- No idea if I'm doing the PS3 > PS4 game switchover correctly.  I'm downloading COD for $9.99 as we speak.  Will the PS4 somehow know I already own the digital PS3 version?  Am i wasting several hours waiting for this to download?  Who the heck knows.- I've been fidgeting with the console for a while, can't tell how it should sit in my entertainment center.  It's a rhombus, i mean, it's hard to make it look good in there.- I was hoping for some kind of FAQ onboard, but I have no idea what I can do, and what i cant do.  can i pause downloads to make one download go faster?  doesn't look like it so far.  If i start netflix, will my download pause?  Nobody knows.- The headset it comes with is garbage.  You spent years developing this console, and that's the headset you ship?  The ps3 blutooth headset it far superior to the wired mess they give you, so I'm going to see if this pairs.Tips for your own purchase (or things i would have done differently):- Make sure you have plenty of cash for games, PSN, and a decent TV.  I dont recommend getting this puppy ""half-assed"".  You'll want to have $50 for a year of PSN (~$4.00 per month), ~$120.00 for at least a few games, and make sure you have a native 1080P tv.  Really, youre spending ~600.00 to get this baby up and running full steam, with 2 games.- Charging dock looks cool but thus far has proven unnecessary.- Make sure you hang onto your PS3 discs that promised PS4 carry over.  You NEED to put the PS3 disk in to have the game carryover to PS4.  If you got the digital version, i dont think this is necessary.- Be patient when inputting text.  If you were a PS3 user, you'll be used to pressing ""Start"" when done.  Well, now ""enter"" is actually R2.... I've accidentally erased a long text entry because I forget R2 is ""enter"", a few times now.  be patient!Goodluck and happy gaming,- MoistGamer

You get access to PS network for 1 month free, music 1 month free, $10 to go towards purchase of a game on the network,No weird noises, overheating, constant blue lights, etc..  Only thing i am alittle confused about is... I want to add my sons name as another user on my account. I want him to have access to the same network and games i downloaded. I get a message stating only one user per account. I am confused on how to have multiple users play on one machine.PS:  Shipping box was horrible!  The amazon box was literally half way open exposing what was in it!  Never had a shipment that cost so much arrive like that lol  But glad everything works!

  I know you have to expect issues when you buy a 'used' console, but reselling your garbage is another thing entirely.Quite simply, the console didn't work. On the rare occasions it actually managed to start up, I couldn't play more than 15-20 minutes before a blue ""haze"" covered the screen and the system became nonoperational. The only way to fix it was to pull the plug, which (of course) caused more data loss and subsequent crashes. I had to return it for a refund.That said, I will commend the company (JMS Holdings) on their excellent customer service. My request (and the actual refund) were processed very quickly, and I got the entirety of my money back. That matters, especially when you're dealing with a high-price item, and I appreciate it.

I have owned a PS, PS2, Xbox, 360, and PS3 in that order and I have loved every system for as long as I have played them. The PS4 has a new interface but I wouldn't say I love it just yet, but I do prefer the PS3 interface to the PS4. I absolutely love the controller for the PS4. My first game to play on the next gen would be Killzone Shadow Fall. With the new touch screen (very user friendly/ Very easy to use) added on to the controller I believe it will add a whole new experience to the gaming community, and its just down right fun controlling your owl with the touch screen! My only regret about purchasing the PS4 is that Titanfall looks ***king amazing! But I have a 360 so I will just get it for that.

  Very happy with this system so far. It boots up quickly, the menus are very snappy and the UI is easy to navigate. So far I've played Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag, NBA 2K14 and Resogun. They all run super smoothly with no framerate issues. The machine itself is very quiet and putting my hand over it while gaming the heat doesn't seem to be too crazy. It vents itself well.The DualShock 4 controller feels natural in the hand. A huge improvement over the DualShock 3. It has a bit of heft to it making it feel more substantial and that it is of a good build quality.As for the features, the sharing button and it's operation work very smoothly. It's seamless to share screenshots and video via twitter and Facebook. The only downside is that these are your only options at launch and Facebook's video compression leaves a lot to be desired.All in all the system is a strong foundation for the future. The launch lineup is not stellar (what launch lineup is?), but the hardware is solid and built for the long haul. Can't wait to see what the future holds and glad I get to be a part of it.

  This is one of the best consoles I've ever played, but it is far from the best, at least so far coming up to it's one year anniversary. The PlayStation 4 was supposed to be known as having all the games while the Xbox One has all the media, but I don't think that is the case. The games for the Xbox One have been slightly better in my opinion, and the dashboard and Xbox Gold are much better now. Sony has taken a dangerous approach: they are in the lead, but they are squabbling and not innovating enough. Things like DLNA media playback, MP3 playback, and resuming games from sleep are promised features that are still missing. 3D Blu-ray support just came today AFTER Xbox One, which is sad considering Sony has been very aggressive with 3D and Blu-ray. That being said, I still think this is the better system. I don't know all the components, but it is known that the PS4 is faster and more powerful than the Xbox One, and some may say this is irrelevant, it may become more apparent down the road. Either way, it still gives me peace of mind that I have a more powerful system. I would have said it's cheaper, but now it is on par with the Xbox One. PlayStation Plus is a great service that I am much happier paying for than Xbox Live Gold, but they are becoming more and more equal.I do like the trackpad, the controller itself (way more than the Xbox One controller), the new R2 and L2 triggers, the look of the system, the feel of the operating system, and let's not forget about the great games that ARE coming, such as 1882: The Order, Destiny, The Last of Us PS4, No Man's Sky, LittleBigPlanet 3, and much more. If I had to buy a new console over again, I would pick the PS4 100 out of 100 times.

  Despite a number of reviews saying Amazon's packaging was subpar for the PS4 launch, I received my console on launch day adequately packaged with no visible damage. After opening my package, I inspected both the HDMI port and included HDMI cable to make sure there was no visible metal pieces in the wrong spot. I then booted up the system and have had no issues since!The system is great, it boots up incredibly fast and there have been so many improvements since the PS3 that I would be here all day talking about them. While the launch lineup is a little lackluster, the number of games coming out in the next few months has made me extremely excited for the potential of this console. Killzone looks marvelous on this console and some of the cinematics just had me in awe as I played. I also purchased FIFA which also played without a hitch! The improvement in the fluidity of gameplay between the PS3 and PS4 on crossplatform games is so visible its not even funny.For those people who are complaining that there are features missing from the PS4, please keep in mind that when the PS3 launched it too was missing a lot of the features it eventually added to the console, and that console was $200 more at launch! I am 100% satisfied with the purchase and despite all the negative reviews, I don't think people should be concerned with the quality of the console. Every console launch has its hiccups and at one point the 360 had a 36% failure rate, so compared to that the PS4s problems are minuscule. Take my word for it, you won't regret picking up this console! It was built for the future of gaming unlike the Xbone which is focused mostly on multimedia.

  I love my PS4! You can't go wrong with Sony and the games WILL keep coming. I have had this for a few years now with no problem and it works just as well as day 1. Now that the Pro is out if you have a 4k TV go with that, or maybe even the slim for better form factor.

  Fortunately my PS4 never has given me any major probs. Ive had it since launch. The games that are out for it now arent worth the upgrade but titles will get better later this year. Console has faster loading times, all games are in 1080p and you can stream vids. It still has a few kinks to work out. At times the console will just freeze up and i have to put it in sleep mode or at times unplug it. And at times the PS store doesnt load. The controller is comfy and you can charge it while you play. I just wish this console had more usb ports. It at least needs 4. Accessories easily take up these spaces. Also it needs a bigger hard drive. 500gb its probably enough to download every retail game from launch up until two months afterwards which isnt many. You dont actually get 500 of course. Thats a round off estimate. At least you can change out the hard drive though. I love the share button. So fun using it as a snap shot button for when people get crazy through streams. Congrats Japan on your PS4 release!

  This console is clearly an upgrade to the PS3. I'm happy with the purchase and happier that I waited until Infamous was released. The game doesn't have much to play as of today but it is still a great new Blu-Ray player. :-p  There's also the Remote Play feature. My PSVita now has a very real purpose. Looking forward to many years with my new PS4.

    PS 4 Great new console, but hold onto your PS 3 or 2 for now
  
",4.0,RPD,"Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2013","









  
  
    
  Next generation of game consoles, but being new lacks the great games available on the PS3, PS 4 has more social features built in for sharing on the internet. Sony has adapted the Apple model of iTunes and Amazon.com, selling you a gaming system with the latest and greatest tech at a reasonable price, but making it up in add ons, higher price games, game upgrades from PS3 on some games to PS4 usability. The games so far available show off the PS4 super graphics (eye candy) but lack great story telling like Uncharted series from Naughty Dog. The PS4 as well as the Xbox 1 is not backward compatible with earlier games from PS 2 or 3, so hold onto yours if you have a lot of games that you like to play on them.  A lot more of the new games will be available as DLs that install directly to your HD on your PS4, but I notice that the pricing of some games is higher than if purchased as used games from Gamefly or Gamestop on disc. As with the earlier Playstations as time goes by we will see more and better games that will show the full potential of great games as Developers learn of the possibilities of what is possible.

    PS4 cannot hold a candle to PS3
  
",2.0,CarbonFootprint,"Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2015","









  
  
    
  Had to upgrade to the new PS4 in order to play the new Rockband4 game coming out:  boy am I disappointed!  The PS4 is a shackled husk of it's former self.  The interface is ugly and unwieldy.  There is no support for 3D displays, making my 3d TV, games and BluRays superfluous.  There is a web browser, but it too is nannied, blocking content and downloads.  There is no way to load your purchased movie and TV content onto the hard drive, each viewing streams from their servers, eating up your data allowance.  As far as I can tell the only thing this one does that the other one does not is streaming games, and that too will eat up your data plan.  And there is much that this version does NOT do that the PS3 did, such as holding all my music content and digital movies offline, an adult-oriented browser, 3D support, I am sure I will find more as I own the device.  My recommendation if you liked the PS3 is to buy a couple more of them.  They will be sought after in a short time, and probably worth more than a new PS4.

    Great machine... but where are the games?
  
",4.0,Ethan H.,"Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2014","









  
  
    
  I've been a fan of the Sony Playstation(s) since the first one came out sometime in the late 90's... 1998, 1999?The Playstations become more and more of a computer with each new iteration. The PS4 continues that trend.The initial lineup of games were a bit underwhelming, but it gave fans of certain genres something to play. Indie games are a big focus of the PS4's draw. There are many good indie games that can be found on the PSN. Speaking of PSN, getting a Playstation Plus membership ($50) is essential to getting everything you can out of the console. Unlike the PS3, you need a PS+ membership to play games competitively over the internet.You also get free games every month for being a member of PS+. Keep in mind that these free games become unplayable if and when you decide to forgo the renewal of your membership.The Dualshock controller that is included with the console is the best/most comfortable controller yet. Everything about the controller is very intuitive. The only part of the controller that is severely underutilized is the touch pad in the center of it... I guess developers will think of creative ways of incorporating that into future titles.The one drawback that I noticed so far, compared from its predecessor is that you cannot load videos onto the console... i always liked that you could load mp4 film clips onto it, but not with the PS4... and I'm not even talking movies here, i'm talking videos you take with your phone that you would like to load into the system... nothing... sadness. Thank God for Chromecast... that's another review for another time.Overally, i'm quite pleased with the PS4... I purchased the console, Battlefield 4, a PS+ membership, and a Turtle Beach wireless headset... the only complaint I have is that it lacks some more good software... I miss the good old days where new consoles came with a franchise game (SNES + Super Mario World, Genesis + Sonic, N64 + Mario 64, etc...) I would have love to have seen a new Crash Bandicoot, or Gran Turismo, or even a nice JRPG from Sony... instead, we got games that are made annually... NBA, NFL, COD, BF, etc... not that i'm complaining.... but then, I guess I am. Sigh...I guess with Watch Dogs coming out soon, I have something to look forward to...Overall, I'm very happy with the PS4... especially since I also have a Vita and remote play is a nice touch... but nothing beats online multiplayer... >: )  ....except a nice engrossing role playing game with a great story. :)

  I ordered my PS4 on January 4th. I was one of the lucky few who managed to get an order through at that point because of low PS4 stock. Initially, it was supposed to be delivered by the 15th but instead, I got an email saying delivery was pushed up to the 8th (always good news). So I got the excellent PS4 earlier than expected.I'm not going to go into the PS4 itself, there is already all the information you need elsewhere. What I will say is that if its available to you, I would not hesitate to order a PS4 through Amazon. Delivery was quick and stress free, and I couldn't ask for more from the console.

  I ordered the console off Amazon within 2 minutes of it coming back in stock the Friday before Christmas.  It got to my house on Christmas Eve.  Booted it up, and I knew something was off.  It started in [Safe Mode].  Then went in to download the update, it didn't automatically install.  I had to go back to [Safe Mode] and manually install it.  With this out of the way I got my PSN account set up, linked with my FB account, then started to install NBA 2k14.  I walk into the kitchen and come back and the console was reset.  I logged in and boom it shut itself.  This turned into a constant cycle of going on and off again.  I was really upset.  Called Sony and they said they would ship me a new one once they received mine.  Called Amazon and they sent me one and my new console got here yesterday.  They shipped it before I had even sent mine back to them which was fantastic.Anyways, new console everything went normal, no [Safe Mode], just amazingly fast and smooth PS4, the Next-Gen is here.  Installed NBA 2k14 but turns out the disc was defective so Amazon is sending me a new one.  Since then I have been playing Assassin's Creed IV and it is a lot of fun.  I have also been playing the Killzone multiplayer demo and will probably buy that as it has been fun as well.Overall the PS4 is fantastic, very fast, very smooth, very responsive.  The controller is awesome.  Here is the part I was most impressed with.  I have a set of Corsair Vengeance 1500 V2 USB headset that I use with my PC.  Well I plugged these into the PS4 USB ports, went into the audio settings on the PS4 menu while ingame, and switched it so all audio went through my headset.  BOOM it worked I was astonished they were compatible because this headset had been dissappointing me by not working that great with my PC but now I realize it is my USB ports on my PC that are the problem.  With the PS4 they work awesome.If all you care about is gaming, do yourself a favor and get a PS4.  If you wanna run your media set up through your console and talk to your tv then get an Xbox one.  Both are great systems for there purposes.  Sony has really made a great comeback whereas Microsoft has gone in a different ""total entertainment"" direction.Can't wait for more games and even better graphics to come.

  I am rating the console not DOAs. For the time being this is my review of my PS4. It gets 5 stars atm but it does need some firmware updates, and obviously, sorting out the usual launch issues and Chinese manufacturing issues will take time. I feel bad for those that got DOAs and I discuss that at the bottom a bit. But for now I have to review my system.For what it is the is the greatest console ever released. The DS4 is near perfect, although I still could use more heft on the backside it is about as good as the original design can get at this point. I mark it slightly higher than the 360 controller and that is high praise. The UI is sweet and fast. MUCH faster than the XMB ever was. Doing things like sharing stuff, contacting people, and general social fare has never been easier on any console. The Xbox One looks to have the same thing going on.As for the power this thing puts out games like KZSF are clearly in the top tier of PC games with some framerate issues and a tad lesser IQ. Everything else is stunning for a launch game. I have no idea where all the bad reviews are coming from but I can guess as with every launch a few people were well paid for their efforts. All in all Sony has done a remarkable turnaround. This console means business, is very quiet, and produces the best launch graphics in any FPS ever for a console. So much so that with just a little extra here and there the game would be top end PC fare if it could produce a stable 60 FPS framerate. Still, we do get a solid 30-40 in campaign, and damn does it look good, and about 40-60 in multiplayer. SO the PS4 is clearly doing its job and the promises of 1080p are here to stay.As far as everything else we need firmware updates. The system is so far pretty bare bones for options. Still don't have all the HDMI sound options needed for receivers, the PS3 got this patch at some point, so my receiver in stereo still sees like 3/4/.1 from the PS4 but it works just with a slightly higher noise floor. There are other things that should carry over from the PS3 as well in time.The DOAs no one really knows what happened. It could be that the extra demand and hence the extra locations of manufacturing produced too much strain or outright sabotage no one knows. It is a fairly small number of dead systems comparing last gen where the console apocalypse basically hit everyone at some point in the launch groin. All I have to say is I can never go back to my PS3. The thing is dated as hell, slow as hell, and has an awful controller. The PS4 is here to stay.

  The first games I bought for my PS4 were Lego Marvel & Battlefield 4 which were great to showcase what the system can do. Resogun is a free game you can play when you're a PS Plus member. I have been playing inFamous Second Son & the DualShock 4 controller couldn't have been any better for the game. The system can fix the friend list & the organization of the menu bars.It doesn't show PS3 players if you're online. The DS4 controller definitely dies fast, a full charge last me about 3 hrs, so buying two controllers is a must.Sony has definitely perfected the PS4, a few software enhancements can make the experience even better.

  Finally, the PS4.  As a console, the design can take some getting used to since the eject button blends in with the console itself.  I wish Sony would have brought all of the music, photo, and video streaming from the PS3 to this console.  It seems strange that I can't have a photo of my wife as my background photo now.  I really love the headphone jack on the controller.  When I'm gaming late at night, I just plug in my Sennheisers and choose to output audio to them.  As soon as I unplug the headphones, the audio automatically switches back to my surround sound.  I wish it came with two controllers, but the PS4 does have an option to leave the USB port hot for 3 hours or all the time.  I chose the 3 hour option to charge my controller after shutting down the system.  HDMI output can be a little flaky.  I figured out I have to turn on the PS4 first to the point where it's outputting video before I turn on my TV.  I didn't have to perform a special sequence with the PS3.  Also, the wifi on the PS4 isn't as good as the wifi on my PS3.  It's probably a firmware bug because it can see my network, but it won't connect since I have MAC address filtering on.  I ran a long ethernet cable from the PS4 to my router.  It just reached with a few feet to spare.  Besides these issues, the console is awesome.  Just waiting for the next Uncharted and Gran Turismo now...

  This is a great gaming machine with a fantastic new controller.  Sony usually puts together solid hardware, over the years I have had no problems with my PS1-PS3's, I expect this machine continue that trend.  There are reports of broken systems, but not sure if there is a clear failure rate at this point.  If that all turns out to be overblown then this device should offer a slight graphics edge over the Xbone at the expense of some media and non game entertainment capabilities.  I give it 4 stars with the only knocks being the strict gaming focus, poor launch titles,  and the shakey PSN network/user interface.I have owned all of the playstation and xbox consoles.  My expectation going into this generation is that I will use the PS4 in my man cave for gaming while the Xbone will be in my living room with the high end home theater system.  I need more media support from a device that is going to be the center of my living room.I was dissapointed to learn of the CD and audio streaming restrictions that Sony has decided to place on this device.  I believe they are back tracking on CD support, but I haven't tried to play an audio CD yet. Streaming audio and itunes quality MP3's sound terrible on good speakers, so yes, I still buy CD's.  Sony was looking to push their own audio service and similar to Microsoft with the DRM overplayed their hand.  Its dissapointing because the PS3 was such an awesome media device.  Apparently it will also not support 3d Blu-ray discs, but a future software upgrade may allow this.  My PS3 was the center of my home theater, this machine is a step backwards for non-gaming related activities.Gaming wise the new controller is a huge step forward.  The previous design never fit my hand right and the sticks always seemed a bit floaty.  After playing a few hours of kill zone I am in love with the new design.  Best PS controller to date and its no contest.The launch titles are weak.  Prior gen games with slightly upgraded textures, Knack, and some download arcade games.  I hear NBA 2k14 looks great, but I hate basketball.  That leaves me with Killzone which looks pretty good in spots, but isn't a whole new world of graphical fidelity.  Its was obviously rushed out the door, blood pools flow up walls for instance, but its not terrible.  Launch titles are usually not that great, and I am sure games are coming that will feel more next gen.  Microsoft has a more appealing launch line up in my opinion, but in the long run that is not a concern.In the end I would say if you are games only and have faith in the PSN network this is the way to go.  If you are looking for a center of the living room device or don't trust PSN go xbox one.  If you don't have to choose then get both and the world is yours.

    A month of PS4
  
",5.0,Carlos E. Coto (Extra-life Gamer),"Reviewed in the United States December 16, 2013","After officially of owning the ps4 for a month, I am ready to write my review.

Update version: 1.52.

The ps4 is sleek in its design and had no trouble upgrading it to a 1.5 terabyte hard drive. After my initial fears of getting a bad product, everything has been working well. The blu-ray player inside it seems to be a bit faster than the ps3 version, and the image looks great.

The User interface on the ps4 is easy to use and seems to be a major improvement over the ps3's XMB. Since I don't have that many games, they haven't become a cluster on the UI as of yet. One thing that I do love is the fact all the video apps are on one area in which you can look at everything. I hope that Sony does that for the games as well so they make the UI without much cluster.

One weakness of the UI however is the blandness to it for now. I hope updates are made to it so it looks better. The music is nice but can be a bit annoying after a while to some users of the ps4. I however, got no problems with it.

The game install times are fast on disc. It installs within 30 seconds to 1:30 seconds, depending on the game. Each game requires an update which you need to start the game for it to download. You can't play online without the updates, however you can play while it downloads. Once it finishes, close the game app and once it finishes installing, go back to it and game away.

The playstation store seems to be faster here, comparing it to the ps3, but it doesn't have many things to buy as it still needs to be updated with newer games. It lacks content as it came out a month ago yesterday. The playstation plus system is great for those who have a ps3, ps4 and/or vita system as it gives you free games (rentals) beta invites, and online storage for your saved game files. This month, they gave away contrast and resogun. Good indie games that can keep you entertained while the newer ones come out next year. If you do want to play online games however, psn+ is needed, but you can still use netflix, hulu, vudu and all other media services at no additional charge since they are not behind a paywall.

The controllers have changed quite a bit from the ps3, adding to it a sleeker design and better grips for the hands. Not to mention a touch pad and changing where the start and select buttons would be, which are now called Options and Share.

The Option button works as a pause button for games giving you direct access to the options menu where you can change the settings of the game, as well as other options given to you within the game. The share button gives you 3 options while you are gaming, giving you a way to take screenshots, upload videos and a streaming option via twitch tv and Ustream. Lag may occur on the streamings depending on your internet connection and bandwidth.

The flaw I see with the controller is the battery life, and only one cable is brought within the console and extra controllers do not bring a charger. The good news is any micro usb will work with the controller.So your own cellphone chargers for android phones could work (so long as they are micro USB.).

Voice commands can make the system work well for you if you bought the camera. Supposedly the headset mic can be used for that as well but I haven't tested it. Sometimes the voice commands do get wonky but it works well to take screenshots without the need to hit the share button.

The wi-fi internet connection on the ps4 seems to have improve from the ps3 settings. I would always have issues with the ps3 on the wi-fi settings, but the ps4 seems to respond better. Though I would recommend keeping it wired for better connections.

One final note would be the remote play. It works well in certain areas when the system is close as there is no lag within what you are doing on the console to the tv. Similar to the wii u's second screen, the vita can be used as a second screen for the ps4, or to play the game through it, without the need to hog the tv. It works wonders in a concrete house. However, the touch screen can be a pain to use in certain games.

Freezes and bugs are common for a console and I did get one glitch in the system yesterday while quitting the movie Turbo from the system. It just stayed there with the loading circle on the screen. Even trying to turn off the console didn't work. I had to go in manually which I do not recommend under any circumstance. One good thing is, if the console shuts down unexpectedly or not in its usual way, you can report to Sony what happened through the ps4.

Overall I have had no truly bad experiences with the ps4 as of yet and through one month of solid gaming I have enjoyed it very well. I give it 5 stars. However for any normal consumer, given the fact that it did froze on me once, and some things don't work too well because of updates needed as well as some tweaks, I give it a 4/5.

Should you buy a ps4 right now or wait? I would suggest wait until the psvita/ps4 bundle or until more games are out there. If you have a ps3 or an xbox 360, both consoles are good enough for now and are still given support so no need to truly jump into the next generation unless you wish to do so.

Hope this review helps everyone and happy gaming.",

    Best new console on the market
  
",5.0,A. Boorstein,"Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2013","









  
  
    
  A great piece of gaming hardware.  By far the best of the new consoles.  Best bang for your buck and it is actually designed to play video games.  the new Dualshock controller is awesome.The new User Interface is sleak and clean.  Easy to navigate around.  I can see it getting a bit crowded the mroe you download, but expect Sony to issue an update to create more tabs in the near future.  Hopefully they allow some coustomization of the UI.The PS4 is tiny.  It's smaller than my PS3 slim.  It reminds me of the PS2 slim from back in the day.The slanted design is not as goofy as I had thought it would be.  I actaully like the look of the machine.  The lightbar on the top is not as obvious as I was afraid.  i was thinking it would be like the Wii's blue light on the disck drive, but you hardly ever notice the lights on the PS4.All in all it's a great gaming system.  I can't wait for some of the big AAA games to hit the market in the next few months.

  I am very impressed with The PlayStation 4.  The controller is a great step forward from the Dualshock 3 and the console looks very slick.  The performance seems very impressive and the graphics look stunning.  My main problem with this console is that it is not compatible with games from previous generations of the PlayStation.  Big drawback for me because I would like to go back and play some of the classics.

  Before my gush I would also ask people reading the one star reviews to sort by newest and see that the VAST majority of posts are unverified, meaning the user hasn't actually purchased a ps4.Amazing console, great free games and playstation plus games ready to go out of the box no purchase required (I already had a year of playstation plus)Remote play to my vita is a godsend, like for tonight... I couldn't sit out in the lounge room playing the ps4 as I was just too tired, so I just hopped straight to my vita, turned the console on from the vita and jumped straight into warframe with some friends. Even better warframe remaps the controls to something better suited for the vita, it takes a little getting used to but it works MUCH better than using the l2 r2 pads at the back, I wish that sony would have moved the touch pads for l2 r2, l3 r3 more towards the corner and less the center, I feel I could use them more as buttons that way -shrugs-Software wise I am missing video playback but they have now said that they will be bringing it in a future patch so I am okay with this.On another note fantastic controller, I have had my second controller for around two weeks now and have a good feel of it... No other game pad compares. I still rather keyboard and mouse over controller for the most part, but this controller is fantastic for everything I wouldn't want a kb mouse for.I would also like people to realize that with WELL over 1million launch editions shipped by amazon ALONE there will be a seemingly large number of failures in hardware... it is what happens with electronics, the difference this time around is this is the biggest console launch in history on a pure numbers basis and people are more connected than ever so the complaints can be heard loudly.The actual failure rate of the console is extremely low (revealed to actually be lower than sony's initial projection of 0.4%) and many of the issues have very simple fixes... My console and the vast majority are fine.there are also scare images going around about console temperatures... the console operates at a very similar temperature to the ps3 slim, people just don't notice it because they aren't constantly touching their old ps3 slim nor are they having images posted about. Some consoles may fault, but at the moment that number is very very low.Ultimately this is a great and cheap companion gaming machine to my more powerful and main gaming pc.SO VERY GLAD TO BE PLAYING AT 1080p!!!

  It runs more efficiently and smoothly than its predecessor PlayStation 3. Design is top-notch, it looks great; release model is already slim and its not loud at all. XMB interface is familiar but definitely updated.The PlayStation Store leaves me wanting more. I expected my digital games bought on the PS3 to be available for use on the PS4, but no such luck. Maybe someday, but as of right now its pretty much completely different stores for PS3 and PS4 consoles.

    PS4 Working Flawlessly
  
",5.0,Jose Gonzalez,"Reviewed in the United States March 18, 2014","









  
  
    
  While waiting for my PlayStation 4, I read into research of the many hardware failures that occurred around launch. So, I did go in with a little bit of panic, but after being told by Sony that they released a second generation of PS4s, I felt more at ease with the system, and come delivery day, I hooked up the console, did the mandatory updates, got my profile set up, and it works like a charm.The only major complaint I have is that there aren't many games out for it, which is normal for a standard console launch, but it's nothing I take points off for. I have my system out in the open and well ventilated, and if you have to ask if I'm a fanboy, the answer is no. I go with the console that suits my needs as a gamer, which I think the PS4 can do. The 1080p/60fps is a bonus incentive to have a PS4.If you're going to get a new console, not speaking as a fanboy, but as a gamer, go with Sony, because I can assure you from my experience that I've had no problems at all with the system, and it's worth the money, even if you wait until the holidays to get one.

  Mine works great.  I've used it quite a bit over the first week and left it on for hours at a time, it never has gotten hotter then warm to the touch and hasn't crashed or had any problems.  Looking at the number of 1-star reviews compared to the number of units amazon moved, even if less then half of the people with failed units have written a review the failure rate would still be less then 1% as Sony indicated.  The Xbox failure rate seems to be about the same,  neither system is having the major problems some people want to believe.The system is very fast and responsive.  The lag of doing everything on the PS3 always bothered me, now everything feels instant.  All downloads and updates are now in the background automatically and don't interrupt your use.  The new layout is simple and easy to use, you don't have to scroll through hundreds of options to do anything like on the PS3.  The new controller is great, they fixed the things I hated about the old one by fixing the triggers and analog sticks.  I was really happy they removed the camera, I have no interest in motion controls.  The launch lineup is a little weak, but there's plenty of great games coming in 2014.  Getting Resogun and Contrast for free was nice.  Resogun really is surprisingly great.  You pretty much have to get PS plus now, however I've had it for years with my PS3 and the number of free games I've gotten out of it is incredible.  It's so worth it, especially if you also have a PS3 (or Vita).  Sony periodically has sales / credit back deals so whenever there's a discount I buy a year of PS+ then it stacks onto your current account.

  Performs without any trouble, only downside at the moment are lack of games and lack of many features that existed in the previous generation, local audio\video playback, DLNA support, All of which might be fixed in the future with software updates.Getting PS Plus annually is highly recommended as starting from July 2014 it'll be two free games every month Guaranteed. SO you get 2 games for ~$5 a month.If you want to sweeten the deal throw in the new Vita bundle for $200, then you have PS4 remote play plus another 2 free games from plus.All in all a fantastic entertainment package.

  I passed over a launch day console due to my bad luck in the past on machines that didn't work on day one.  My intention was to wait until Second Son was released so I would miss out on the buggy first few months that can happen with a new machine...but just couldn't wait that long.  I made it about a month before I gave in and picked up a PS4 on Amazon.  I waited awhile before reviewing since the initial game line up was a little weak.  Now I've tried plenty of new games over the past few months, with some of my favorites still to come.  I really choose the PS4 over the XBOXONE due to what I felt was a slightly better first year of game line up.  That and the price point were the major sellers.  I've always been a playstation fan but really enjoyed the XBOX360 the best out of the previous gen consoles.  I will still pick up a XBOXONE at some point, maybe a year or so.  But for now I really love the PS4!  Great choice!  Some of the major pluses for me are the controller, which I find to be the perfect size and shape.  And the UI.  The navigation is smooth and I love the Playstation Plus membership.  Really worth the price of admission.  I even find myself renting movies and tv shows from the store.  Even the Apps are smooth, but only a limited amount available currently.  All in all super happy and can't wait for some the games coming in June and beyond.

  Great console which really shows how PlayStation has matured in time. While it's specifications are endlessly debated as in all console generations; they are first class and covered by other raters. What is notable is how well the PlayStation OS and online network has evolved from the PS3 days. Very well designed OS and GUI, with quick transitions and a high degree of social media and video/image sharing built in that really separates this from the competition.The game library is still a bit thin, as most early days for a generation are; but with the ease of development, the upcoming library is very exciting. Sort of has a PlayStation2-esque feel to it.Recommended for any console buyers. It's time to jump in.

  After owning the PS4 for about two years the internal fan has completely stopped working which causes the system to shut down after having it on for a short time, rendering it unplayable. The PS4 has never been dropped or handled roughly so there is no reason that the fan should not be working. I now have to pay a total of about $40 for a new fan, thermal paste, and thermal paste remover so I can try to fix it myself. I've heard Sony charges around $100 to fix it so I will not be sending it to them for repair. I am very disappointed.

  reviews have been out for 3 + months already by now so why does mine matter ? It doesn't, but all you need to know is that Sony's next gen console is worth every penny.  The interface looks interesting and weird at first and i thought i didn't like it but, after a good 5 - 10 min it hit me i got it.  Your home page or main start screen is filled with past history challenges and feats friends challenges against yours active gameplay of your friends.  Your start screen is increased in content by; how many games you have and actively shows your library, by connecting to social networks it integrates the gaming community on PSN with all your friends to see.the playstation vita second screen experience and remote play is by far one of the coolest things ever, their is virtually no lag at all, even while i was playing Killzone SF.My overall opinion....if you call yourself a ""gamer"" this is the console for you.  The competition doesn't stand a chance right now if everything keeps going in Sony's favor.

  The system is very nice! The UI is intuitive and incredibly easy to use. Its fluid and very fast. Its a MAJOR improvement on the XMB on the PS3. The game loads instantly and the mandatory download for a disc takes just a minute to install so you will be playing the game before you know it. I still notice some responsive delay on the store though but this could be fixed with an update. The video apps works really well although the keyboard on the apps (such as Amazon Instant) can be difficult to use. The system does make some noise upon start up but within 1 minute, quiets down and you won't hear a thing. The standby mode is well done as the controllers can be charged even though the system isn't on.

  i also have not experienced any problems with my PS4. On launch day there were some PSN connectivity issues for a couple of hours but once it started working it KEPT working.As others have stated, amazon's packaging was sub-par. Only bubble air bags on top of the psn in the box, no protection for it underneath. So if the box gets dropped right-side-up, the playstation takes the brunt of the impact.  I find this very unusual for amazon. Usually they take great care in packaging things i order from them. I've ordered shoes that have had more protection than my $400 fragile PS4.That being said, i have yet to experience any hardware issues, though it has also only been 4 days since release.The ps4 interface is fast, intuitive, and responsive. Best feature so far of the PS4 is easily the controller. The touchpad and built-in speaker are nice additions (when utilized) but the best thing is the 3.5mm headphone jack in the controller. You can just plug any set of headphones in them and listen to the game's audio through them. This is great for playing FPS multiplayer and hearing people coming. You do have to hold the PS button down and adjust your audio settings the first time, but its really easy.Graphics look fantastic. Gameplay is smooth and it really makes you look forward to what's still to come in this new generation of gaming.

  First I want to state that my initial launch edition was doa out of the box with the pulsing blue light and no video defect.  In less than a week amazon had a brand new one to me and this one worked perfect.  Props to amazon for quick turnaround, they always seem to make things right.After finally getting a chance to play this new console I can easily see what all the hype is about.  Not only does the system look very hansom sitting next to it's older brother (ps3), it's very quiet even with a disc in the drive.  The UI is simple and easy to navigate, I had no problems figuring out where to go or what to do.  The controller really feels like a quality item.  If feels really sturdy and comfortable in my hands.  The new touch pad and little speaker is a nice addition.  Sony didn't skimp on this thing.The first game I downloaded was of course Resogun and while it seems like a simple arcade type shooter, it still finds a way to show off what the system can do.  Very fun and addictive.  After that I popped in Assassin's Creed 4 and was in awe of how the game plays and looks.  It truly feels next gen.  I'm very excited for what the future holds in the PlayStation 4!  Also, I'd like to add that the share options are very cool and make it so simple to show people what you're playing.  It really impressed me.I would highly recommend getting this system if you're thinking next gen.

  What is the PS4 like after you have had a week to let the new console excitement wear off?  Good.  Not great but good.Pros:The Look - The PS4 looks great.  Some people don't like the lights on it but I do.  I think it's makes the console stand out from previous consoles.Hardware - I haven't run into any lag, frame rate issues, slow load times, or slow download times.  So far it seems like they really used top notch hardware.Controller - The controller is good. I wish the trigger buttons were larger and I wish the options and share buttons were a little larger but other than that it's a great improvement over the old Dualshocks.Software - Right now it's average but still a plus.  I liked the layout of the PS3 better.  I don't doubt for a minute that the overlays and menus are going to change overtime.  It also seems like Sony is taking a ""wait and see"" approach.  The software seems a little shallow right now but you can tell it could easily be expanded.  One big plus right now is the enhancement of the trophies.  Now trophies tell you what percentage of players have obtained them and, if it's a PS4 game, you can see how rare the trophy is.Cons:Missing Options - There are some things that really need to be adjusted. For instance if you plug in the PS4 camera you cannot turn it off without unplugging it.  There are a couple of other things like this that can get annoying.Sharing - This needs work.  I find myself sharing stuff because of accidental button presses.  Also you need to be careful and narrow down what you share or you'll virtually spam your friends with junk. I want to see more options too.  I haven't been able to figure out how to upload to YouTube from the PS4.  I also want some good editing options.  If I'm going to share I want to share something I'd want to watch, not a simple screen shot or video capture.PS Plus - This is on here because it's driving me nuts.  I am a PS Plus member.  The store doesn't seem to know that.  When I go into the PS Plus section it tries to get me to buy a membership.  I end up looking at what is included into Plus, going to the other sections of store, hunting down the item, and then it seems to figure out that I'm a Plus member. Granted this should be fixed soon but it's odd that it's busted in the first place.My guess is within a year or two the PS4 is going to be a 5 star product.  Right now it has a lot of potential.  Let's keep our fingers crossed and hope Sony doesn't screw it up somehow.

    Powerful and Affordable. It's everything gamers asked for.
  
",5.0,PS3Gamer222,"Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2015","









  
  
    
  Design, Price and Power - IMO ps4 is the best of the current generation consoles. It is the most powerful of the 3 major consoles boasting realistic graphics in 1080p. Multiplatform games shared between  Ps4 and Xbox One tend to run better and look slightly better on the ps4. Considering the vast overlap of titles between the big 2 consoles Ps4 is an obvious purchase for gamers who typically play multiplatform titles. The pricepoint is very fair as well. Ps4 launched for 399 dollars compared to Xbox Ones 499 dollar price. A good value considering it is the more powerful console. Design wise Ps4 is sleek and sexy. It is similar in size to Sonys PS3 slim meaning it will fit nicely and look good in most spaces. The system can run a bit hot though in closed spaces. The system uses Blu Ray discs just like Ps3 did. This model came with a 500GB HDD. I felt they could have made it bigger but 500GB was fair for the price.Game Library - Ps4 is a multiplatform centric console. 95% of the good games are going to be available on other platforms or last gen remasters. This is good in that Ps4 owners will never have a shortage of great games to play but also a bit disappointing in that Ps4 has few exclusives that make it stand out in a unique way. But compared to the competition PS4 is the best option as it gets the best versions of multiplats on consoles and has enough exclusives to keep things intresting including standout exclusive The Last Of Us Remastered which IMO is one of the best games ever in terms of storyline and gameplay. A true masterpiece which Ps4 owners need to own.Online - The Playstation Network  in still intact. You have a modern online store featuring various forms of media, mainly movies and videogames. The biggest difference is the pricetag. Playing online games will now cost you 50 dollars a year. I found this very disappointing as someone who enjoyed PS3s free online. This is probably my biggest criticism of the Ps4. I feel like paying for online is silly considering PC gamers still get free online play in multiplats.Overall 9/10It's the best option for hardcore gamers in the console realm. Sony clearly listened to criticism of the PS3 and priced the PS4 accordingly. On the downside I can't give it a perfect 10 because the HDD is a bit small and not future proofed and paying 50 dollars for online is a bit absurd. But the bottom line stands if you are in the market for a videogame console PS4 is the best option for the majority of gamers.

  I skipped the entre PS3 era, not a fanboy I just got an Xbox 360 for Xmas back then so that's what I rocked with. Got the Xbox one on launch and waited for a PS4 to become available for MONTHS.. Finally got lucky and saw amazon and not some independent seller sellin for 200+ over retail, and couldn't be happier. I love the UI of the PS4 Surprisingly more than my XB1, wish I could make custom themes though like on PS3 but no biggie, I haven't had any problems. I find myself using it more than my XB1 and I have TitanFall Lls, seriously tho it's great for everything. Games, movies, and Internet.Edit: I actually like the PS4 yi better but the Xbox one apps better. Internet is waay better on XBOX one. Better flash player so less restrictions on websites (for movie steamers) ;)

  Very nervous about purchasing such an expensive gaming console from a third party site, however they kept true to their word about their product and I've yet to put it down. I went from the Playstation 3 to the new Playstation 4 only recently (late, yes I know, haven't had much time for gaming.) and yet with all the new features and expansive assortment of options available, the difference is day and night.What truly separates the ps4 from the competitors (I'm looking at you xbox 1) is the sheer amount of upgrades and performance enhancers built into this console. Playstation truly too it to the next level with this piece of engineering from the software to the cosmetics. Sleek, simple and yet elegant in its own way. I could go on for days about the technicality of it but I'll just leave y'all with this: Bar none the PS4 beats out any other gaming console to date, and I highly recommend it. So go ahead, enjoy.The only discrepancy I have about the PS4 online capabilities is the fact that going from free to play online to now having to pay $50 a year for the playstation plus subscription, is a little absurd, one of the elements of why I favored the ps3 to xbox 360, but oh well. It is well worth it in the amount of things you get back from your payment; including 2 free games every month!!

  This console is very good, Just like the Xbox one and yes I own both. Each console is set for each certain group of gamers. I have my Xbox one and play Ryse son of Rome while watching Impractical Jokers ( Loving the snap Feature ). But the Ps4 and more of a Hard core gaming console pushing that 1080p and a lot cheaper than the Xbox one.The Ps4 is worth getting because well the price is very cheap and that is good in this day age, And the graphics it can push out are Amazing and do not get me started on the Ps4 Camera. Overall its a good console and so is the Xbox one as well.The Xbox one is more of a laid back Gaming console, I never feel like im going hard at a game unlike when im playing Bf4 on my Ps4 and those 1080p Graphics are hitting me!.Anyways the point is, To me the Ps4 is for hard core gamers while the Xbox one is more of a laid back console that you will use for your daily life.

",5.0,MikeTop Contributor: Photography,"Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2013","









  
  
    
  I bought this 45 mins after the launch.  I'm really impressed with the console.  Most know the Specs etc. Last gen consoles I've owned 2 ps3s and 3 xbox 360s.  I only ever used the ps3 for Blu Rays since xbox had more games that I was interested in.  With this generation I choose the PS4 due to it being $100 cheaper than the XOne.  I'm an old school gamer and have no desire to use the Kinect or any other movement device so why pay for something I'm not going to use.  PS4 was targeted at the gamer where as the XOne is trying to cover all entertainment aspects.  Don't get me wrong I do have my system linked with my digital library and other apps, but I still use it mainly for gaming.  Another thing that turned me off from XOne is the stunt they pulled over the summer saying about being on at least once every 24hrs or their used game policy, then doing an about face when the gaming community spoke up about it.  I wasn't that swayed by the about face so I decided I'll go with the PS4 for this generation.  I may end up getting the XOne eventually if they sell it without the kinect and it's the same price as the PS4.  But it will probably be about 2-3 yrs before making the plunge for that system if I do it at all.  As of now I love this system enough that I will be buying 3 more for my kids and living area.As far as the shipping of the item.  As others stated the PS4 was put in the bottom of the box and the packing material was put on top of the console.  Shame on Amazon's shipping department for not putting in packing material then the console.  UPS is not gentle in their delivery methods as I've had occasionally had box come banged up or tore up on the side.  I will give credit to Amazon that if there is ever a damaged, lost item they will quickly resolve the issue.

  I pre-ordered this item right when it was available on June 10, 2013. I saw the E3 conference and I knew this would replace my 7 year old PS3.I received the console midday on November 15, 2013 with 3 games received before the console: Assassin's Creed 4, Killzone Shadow Fall, & Just Dance 2014. When I first turned ON the console it was easy to set up everything, the camera, HDMI, and Digit Out (audio).Games:The games look amazing compared to the last generation games. With the added memory, the maps remember where weapons/items you left on the ground (example all the enemies killed/their weapons, bullet holes, etc.). One downside of these games is that they install the whole game on the PS4's HDD. 3 games took about 110GB so most likely I'll be getting a bigger HDD in the coming years. The benefit of this is that games load up much faster. Also that games run in native 1080p meaning that no more games that have lower resolutions due to some factors.Videos:Well nothing new on videos since most people still have FHD TVs and Blu-Ray is the same. The only difference is the 4K support. Since I don't own any 4K Blu-Ray movies I can't comment on this. This doesn't mean that games will play in 4K.PS Camera: This camera is better than all cameras by PlayStation (obviously). It has dual 720p cameras that capture depth as long as recognizing faces. With Just Dance it works well. The only problem is that it doesn't work well with more than one person, it confuses between players. Not sure if it is the camera's fault or the game. Because the motion controllers still work flawlessly.Things I didn't like:The UI. I already have more than a dozen games and they are put in a single row. In order to find the game you haven't played in a while, you have to go across the whole list to get to it. I think it would be better if it had a column/row list and the option to order them alphabetically  or in order of last played.The features that were promised but still no date to when it is going to be released. They had a feature where you play a game and pause it, then put your system in standby mode, when you turn it back on it would return exactly where you left off.Overall this is a great system and I would highly recommend this to gamers and family people alike.

I hate scrolling through a million pictures to get to the one game or demo I want to play.The controller fells good.  Works well.  It dies pretty quickly, though.I feel like it was an unnecessary platform, honestly, with few games seeming like large graphical improvements upon the PS3.  I only bought it to play Uncharted 4, and I'll pick up a few more gems on the way until I get a gaming PC.

  Size:The PS4 is actually slimmer than the PS3 Slim which is phenomenal as I tend to carry my console everywhere I go so it is convenient for me since its not clunky or heavy at all.Gameplay:The games play like a dream and it appears that the PS4 install majority of the game from the disc so there would be very little sound of the system loading from the actual disc.Apps:As of right now, there is a lack of apps so I can't play youtube although it can be done from the internet app from the PS4 . Pretty sure future updates would address lack of current apps available for the PS4.Best Feature - Remote Play:FINALLY able to utilize remote play from the PS Vita to the PS4. Every game that doesn't require the PS4 camera has worked so far on remote play and absolutely loving it.Overall - great system with some room for improvement.P.S. Unlike other retail stores, Amazon was actually reliable in honoring their orders once accepting my payment for the PS4 as I had horrid experiences in trying to acquire the PS4 from other main brand stores as they would give me excuses like something was wrong with my payment information or apologized for running out without updating their information.

  Happy with ps4 it is easy to setup, I just want to say though when I first turned it on I noticed the disc drive was making loud noises, So after I had set it up I shut it down and turned it vertically and then turned it back on the noise stopped and I popped in a blu ray movie and everything was fine. I think maybe cold weather here or just from sitting around in the warehouse caused the drive inside to stick.Just want to add an update about game installations in case people are not aware, when you first pop in a game the disc drive gets a little noisy that is only because its performing afull installation of the game which takes about five to ten minutes. At the same time you will be able to play the game while it installs and when the installation is done the drive becomesvery quiet.

  I wasn't the first in line to get the PS4, and I missed a few times when Amazon got it in stock before Xmas. But just before Xmas, they got in extra stock, and I ordered it. Amazingly, without paying extra, I got it in time for the holiday (but since it was for me, it wasn't that big of a deal).First thing is that Amazon packed this in an oversized box, completely covered in packing material. This box could literally have been run over by the UPS truck and the PS4 survived. I was impressed.There are hundreds of reviews of this next generation console, so there's not much for me to add. The controller is very nice, but it took a few days to get used to new configurations (you can switch back to old configuration of the controller if you want). The home screen of the game is very cool with a soothing music playing in the background, which was fun.I immediately moved my Call of Duty:Ghosts from the PS3 to PS4 (I went digital) for $10, and started playing. The PS4 version of the game is light years ahead. The game play is almost exactly the same, but the graphics are incredible. In one map, there are hot embers falling from a fire, right into your field of view. Fog covers the ground in some maps. Dust swirls. Everything is more detailed, more realistic. The game loads faster and seems just speedier.When I first got the PS4, the Sony Playstation gaming headset would not work with the unit, though you could plug it into the controller with a wire. Not a great solution, but it worked. But a recent PS4 update now allows me to use Sony Playstation headsets wirelessly. So, this is no longer a issue, though I have no idea if other non-Sony headsets work.All that being said, there are a few issues that bring my review down to 4.5 stars, but I still round up:1. The included headset is just not worth the trouble. It is noisy, and of course, you still need sound of the game coming from your speakers. The headset is ONLY for communicating with teammates or giving verbal commands to the console. Others who are using the headset put a lot of background noise which forces you to mute people with bad mikes.2. The controller battery seems to last only part of a day.3. You have to buy a Playstation Plus subscription to use any multiplayer games. However, you get access to a lot of indie games for free (well, partially free, some force in-app purchases to get the better stuff).4. Some really cool games from the PS3 aren't playable. Yet.All in all, the PS4 is a great console, a serious worthwhile upgrade over the PS3. I haven't touched my PS3 since the switch, you can really tell it's the previous generation.
