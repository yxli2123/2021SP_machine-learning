    Buyer Beware! You CAN use your treadmill without registering with iFit. Don't get scammed!
  
",1.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  Buyer Beware!After setting up your treadmill and turning it on, the screen will say ""Go to iFit.Com and register to activate."" It will appear that you need to sign-up for iFit to turn on your treadmill. iFit will ask for your credit card and will start a free trial, after which you will be AUTOMATICALLY charged $15.00 a month.You can get around registering for iFit, but NordicTrack does not state this anywhere in the manual and the packaging says you cannot start your treadmill before registering with iFit. This is predatory, and I actually think criminal behavior on the part of NordicTrak.TO GET AROUND THIS SCAM, hold down the iFit logo on the treadmill for 30 seconds and your treadmill will work. I hope this helps people from being forced to give out their credit card and personal information.

  I just got my NordicTrack T 6.5 treadmill today. I had it professionally installed. The installer told me that it is impossible to activate the machine unless you go online to ifit to register the product. Once there the wanted me to give all my personal info, give my credit card information, download their app, and signup for ifit that cost $180 per year. The installer convinced me to sign up and said I can cancel anytime during the first month for free. Feeling like I didn't have a choice I went ahead and signed up. After the installer left I decided to go back in and cancel iFit. First I tried to go to their website to cancel and could not find a link anywhere to cancel. Next I tried calling them and got put on hold for 30 minutes. I finally hung up and decide to try their chat. For the next 1/2 hour I kept getting messages saying ""Thank you for your patience while we connect you with the next available agent."" After a half hour of waiting I decided to try the phone again. After being on hold for another half hour I finally got through they told me they prefer I go online to cancel. When I asked them where the link was to do that he said he wasn't sure. I finally got them to cancel over the phone. It only took about 2 hours all total. I am beginning to think this is a scam and am considering just sending the treadmill back to Amazon.

  I would of given it 4.5 if I could. Let me start by saying that I am more than satisfied with this treadmill. Some people were saying that this treadmill was only good for fast walking or light jogging. This is absolutely inaccurate. The speeds are 1-10 and most of the time I can't even go past 6 for my fast jogging. I also read people saying that you couldn't increase speeds in increments, another inaccuracy, you absolutely can! Incline is very good, solid, and responsive. I feel as if people are trying to knock this perfectly solid treadmill to make way for newer models.OK, so it doesn't have fans, or TV screen, or a doughnut maker. Really people? Are you here to get a good workout or watch TV? Most of the time I use my phone for music anyway, that way I can have the music blasting in my ear. My basement is perfectly cool for my treadmill and if necessary I could always just put a standing fan in front of it. I agree that the panel speakers suck. Use earphones or your stereo, problem solved.The cup holders are nice and large to put your keys, watch, socks, if you like running barefooted like an animal, cellphone, or your Big Gulp drink that you got form 7-Eleven.The panel has plenty of options to keep track of all kinds of stuff. Honestly I only use time, or distance, but I understand it's cool to have little preset workouts and other options. I might want to keep track of how much lard falls of my body one day with the calorie option.I guess my light humor comes from the fact that I got such a great deal for such great quality and competent treadmill :) .

    No shaking. Sturdy. Quality product.

  I had a tough time deciding on treadmill. I was looking into the 200 price range but every time I read a review they said things like ""don't try to run on it"" So I kept raising the price range until I found one that I was able to find the qualities I was looking for. I wanted something that you could run at least 10 mph on and had an incline but not a manual one, and also a fold up one because it would have to be placed in the living room. I read a review on this treadmill that convinced me this one was the one. I am 5'2 and 196 lbs. I used to be a runner but then I had kids. Between work, kids and making dinner I found little time to exercise. Now I am so happy I made the choice of buying this treadmill. This treadmill is well made and sturdy. It does not shake when I run and is easily portable. When it was delivered I had to schedule to be there because it needed to be signed off by the delivery company. They brought it into my house in a very large box. It does take 2 people to assemble because someone has to hold the console piece while you connect the one wire. It took about 30 minutes to assemble. My husband did most of it with no difficulties. After plugging into the wall there is a switch at the bottom in the front that turns on the treadmill. The first week I received it I ran 20 miles with a 4.5 mph. No problems so far. I am extremely happy with this purchase.

    Died 20 minutes after professional installation. (UPDATED)
  
",1.0,Sammyk,"Reviewed in the United States July 24, 2017","









  
  
    
  I bought this for my mother, it arrived on time. No issues. I paid for the expert installation, which we had no problems. 15 minutes after the technician left, the thing stopped working. Of course I was at work, so when this occurred my mom did not know what to do. She called the tech back and he confirmed he could not figure out why it stopped. Later that evening I stopped by my moms house to see what the story was. Everything seemed to work except the belt. Now I have to call NordicTrack and see when they can send someone out. Amazon, is pretty good about offering solutions as far as returns.I was given 3 options.1. Call Norditrack2. Have a local repair person fix it, and they would refund me $120.003. Complete refund on both the unit and shipping (I would assume the 3 year maintenance plan).I am giving this 1 star because despite some of the good and bad stories, there should be no reason why this thing should have died.I am hoping I get a quick response tomorrow and we can work from there.I will update as we go along.***************UPDATESo it was initially decided that the motor was broken on the machine by the technician who was dispatched about a week later. It took about 2 weeks to receive another motor. Add a few days to dispatch another tech at this point we are talking almost a month since the machine has arrived. (I was actually contemplating of just doing a return because it was nearing the time to pay the charge on my credit card.) Back to the story, so the tech shows up, we have the new motor, and an excited mom, I then find out that its not the motor, but the control panel. Again back to square one, another 2 weeks for delivery. Again a couple days to dispatch a technician once the part arrived. Tech arrived installed the new control panel and the machine runs, and hasn't had a problem since. Its been working with no issues for about 2 months now. Mom is happy, but I'm not really sure it was worth it. At this point I can't recommend purchasing this unit through this sales channel. Amazon was perfect but I don't know if it is Norditrack, the warehouse who holds this equipment, XPO who ships this equipment, the tech who installed this equipment... bottom line... a product was purchased for over $700 and it didn't work for almost two months from the day the transaction was completed. We weren't given anything for our troubles. Yes we weren't told ""oh well sorry no refunds, all sales are final"", we were offered a refund of $120 if we decided to let Norditrack off the hook and go with a local repair person, but there was nothing saying ""we are sorry for what happened, the month and a half that was lost will be on us"" (the company that failed to delight you as a customer). The only power as a customer is a review, to forewarn others of such an awful experience.I work in the customer service industry, so I know how hard it can be to please customers. In this case, the product offer and the services to support it were abysmal.Sincerely,Sam K.

  Â Great treadmill! Gets the job done. I had it assembled via Amazon because I didn't want to take any chances on messing it up.I will say it super squeaky. I'm not sure why. My previous (much cheaper) treadmill didn't squeak. Not really sure what to do to remedy this.

  The machine is great and delivery and set up went very smoothly. HOWEVER, the claim of a free 1-year iFit membership is FALSE! After getting the run around from NordicTrack and iFit, I called Amazon Support.

",1.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2019","









  
  
    
  I will start with the main reason why you should not buy this treadmill before going into details.NordicTrack deceptively makes you believe that the treadmill will not work unless you sign up for their iFit program requiring your credit card and other info. The info on how to bypass is not found anywhere in there manuals, their website, youtube or google. Shameful strong arm tactic. After you give them your credit card number then they will tell you to HOLD DOWN THE IFIT BUTTON FOR 30 SECONDS. I found this out after hours of trying to figure out of how to avoid giving them my credit card number.After I signed up, I called the next day to cancel the subscription and was on hold for 64 minutes before the call was disconnected on their end. The second call , I held for about 50 minutes before I hung up. The 3rd time I called when they first open and held for 15 minutes before someone picked up.Extremely disappointed that this is Amazon's Choice. Purchased this treadmill based on the fact that is showed Amazon's Choice. Assembly date had to be rescheduled a couple of times, finally came on a Sunday about 4pm. Assembly guy was a good guy, not his fault. He let me know that the cover to the motor was broken. I am now on hold 35 minutes and 52 seconds trying to get a replacement.

    Totally defective NORDIK TRACK DOESNT WANT TO FIX IT
  
",1.0,dealseeker,"Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2017","









  
  
    
  If I could give it a zero I would. I received this machine defective. It will not work. My husband and I assembled the machine exactly how the instructions stated. Its no damn cake walk either. A lot of the parts were built improperly so they did not fit together very well. It took a lot of pressure to get the parts to come together appropriate enough that we could insert the screws. One of the bolts I got was completely welded over the on the head and I could not use it at all. After we got the machine together and went thru the set up process, the machines belt was not moving at all. We called Nordic track customer support he said the control board was bad. SO we waited a week for parts, replaced the board and went thru the setup and calibration process, Still did nothing....Called customer service again, now they are saying its the wire leading from the board to the console.... which means we have to take the entire machine apart and replace the wire and set it up all over again and to be honest they don't even know if that's it... If it isnt that part they send a different part in the mail. If I want a tech to come out I have to wait till he calls me to schedule a day. The whole process takes a week or two. Do this three times and it's just not worth the time and energy. I just paid a lot of money for this machine and here I am rebuilding the whole thing. Nordic tracks customer service and warranty is a joke!!!!! DONT BUY FROM NORDIK TRACK! Here we are with a broken machine due to no fault of our own and no one is willing to get their butts out here to fix it or replace it.UPDATE: THANKS TO AMAZON IM ABLE TO RETURM THE MACHINE FOR A FULL REFUND. THEY ARE SENDING OUT THEIR DELIVERY GUYS TO COME GET THE MACHINE, I DONT EVEN HAVE TO BOX IT BACK UP! THANK YOU AMAZON!!!!!!!

  This was my first large treadmill purchase and I was a bit reluctant to purchase such a beast of equipment online without first trying it in a store. To add to the excitement, I decided to opt for basic front door delivery with Prime and put this machine together without professional assistance. I ordered the treadmill on a Friday afternoon and received the package the following Tuesday. It was packaged extraordinarily well and arrived on a wood pallet. This thing is HEAVY - but my husband and I were able to move it with minimal issues (moving coasters helped!). As for putting it together, my husband was able to accomplish this in about an hour and a half by himself. He was surprised at how straightforward the assembly was, although quickly admitted that it was definitely a two person job. Once we remembered to put the red magnetic key in the front of the machine, we were in business! This is a very well made piece of equipment that operates beautifully at the highest of inclines and at all available speeds - and it is STURDY. We are very happy with this purchase. Thank you Amazon and NordicTrack!

    Excellent treadmill with some mind-boggling technology misses

  THE GOOD:Easy for 2 people who have put together a lot of you-build-it furniture over the years to assemble and took about 90 minutes.The belt, motor, and critical mechanical parts appear to be well-made with quality materials. The display console doesn't quite have the same premium feel as the rest of the assembly, but on a machine at this price point I'd rather made tradeoffs there than the mechanical parts.iFit is a double-edge sword, with half of the experience falling in the ""this is a total game changer"" and the other half falling in the ""this is an unacceptable trainwreck"" category. When you manage to navigate your way through the impenetrable user experience to finally load the workout you were looking for it justifies the price -- the live video instructor-led workouts are phenomenal at this price point.THE BAD:You won't actually be able to find this stated anywhere online, but the treadmill has no outputs or bluetooth capability so you're forced to watch everything on the 10"" screen (the S has bluetooth because it doesn't have a screen, but you lose bluetooth with the Si). The 10"" screen is great if you don't have the ability to connect to a larger external monitor, but from the number of questions on this topic it's safe to assume that, like myself, many people want to output the video to a larger screen. Some of the more expensive Nordictracks apparently have this capability, and frankly had I known this I would have purchased a step-up model. It's fine if you don't want to offer this on the economy model, just make sure it's called-out (e.g. ""video output through integrated screen only, no support for external monitors or TV"").You can't use headphones with iFit workouts and must use the integrated speakers. Non-starter if you're working out when others are sleeping or if you live in a smaller space and don't want to disturb others. Again, it's fine to not offer this, but it needs to be called-out (e.g. ""audio output through integrated speakers only, no support for headphones"")iFit in general: thousands of confused and angry users have said everything you can possibly say about the terrible iFit user experience: it's doesn't reflect professional commercial software standards for interaction design, lacking even such basic functions as search... it's true, there's no way to search the large library of iFit videos unless you pay some dude who scrapes the content another 30 bucks a year for access to his private database. The lack of search is just the tip of the iceberg though -- iFit is one of the most poorly-designed interactive experiences I've come across in the last few years, falling down at almost every step of the user journey.iFit people, if you're listening: the actual service you provide is stellar and the quality of the content is exceptional. You're shooting yourselves in both feet by ignoring basic usability, and this has been going on long enough that if you don't get serious about fixing it one of your competitors is going to eat your lunch and steal your users by doing the exact same thing you're doing but actually delivering an experience that works. You've already done the hard stuff, for crying out loud -- the work to get the experience out of the gutter isn't rocket science. Fix it.

  I usually don't write reviews, but this treadmill absolutely deserves one!I have had this for a little over a month and I am in love.  A few things I think worth noting:-I have bad knees and the belt on this treadmill doesn't hurt them at all.-I love the fact that you get an ifit membership free for a year.  Having all of those personal trainers and different workouts available in my home makes morning exercising enjoyable (as enjoyable as morning runs can be;)).  They really make the runs go by much quicker.-The sound system on this thing is amazing, my roommates and I actually had a little dance party in the workout room because it sounds so good and connects easily to bluetooth.- It is beautiful.  The screen is a great size and is very high quality.  It's honestly a better treadmill than the treadmills at most gyms.- FANS. ugh having the fans is a game changer for me.-It has a great range of incline and speed.I'm 5'5"" and it's the perfect size for me. HIGHLY RECOMMEND if you want a great way to get in shape in your own home. It's very high-quality for an amazing price.  It honestly makes me want a NordicTrack Elliptical and whatever else they offer too!

  I am a big guy as you might know from such reviews as my desk chair and many other!  Don't know my reviews? ok then I will let that pass this time :)  This treadmill will work up to 300lbs so they say. Luckily I am still slightly under that number.  This can incline 10 degrees and go up to 10 mph.  I trot along between 2 and 4.  Really impressed by it and so far, I am not yet aware if it holds my laundry while drying. As most of my exercise equipment in the past has done.Putting together would be really easy with 2 people. I was in an accident and I don't move around so well and I put it together alone.  Hardest part was the underneath bit where you have to put the bars in for holding it up while being stored.  However I managed.  The thing is a beast and is quite heavy, It does not move on the rug at all while I am using it.Is it loud? Well yes but no louder then any treadmill I have ever been on.  Faster you go, louder it gets. Is it too loud? No!My only complain is that the video they show the unit is not the same as this one. But the pics they show are the same.  if you are thinking of buying this, do it!  For its size, it didn't take up as much room as I thought. Here it is wedged between my 2 other machines

  SIMPLY PUT - THIS IS A FANTASTIC MACHINE!  Iâm an avid runnerâ¦ who has run on many treadmills over the years, and this machine is awesome.  It has all the features and feel of a gym machine just not as bulky or expensive.  Itâs got a lot of bells and whistles, some of which we are still discovering but probably our favorite are the touch screen display and the bluetooth. Also, itâs nice to have a built in speaker and THE FAN! .... This will be GOLD in the summer! Our last treadmill didnât have this and we had to have a ghetto fan rigged up to the machine.We have a pretty small workout space in our garage where this will live and it fits nicely there and can be more compact using the nice hydraulic fold option.  Even our 8 year old daughter can lower and raise the machine by herself.  Our whole family is really pleased with this treadmill.A word about delivery and set-up.  Because itâs an oversized product, itâs not handled by regular amazon delivery. I am always a little leery about the reliability of getting assigned a delivery window, but I will say delivery was prompt and the treadmill arrived within the delivery window as promised.  I was not prepared for the size- the box was HUGE!  It is a treadmill though so it makes sense. Ha! We chose to assemble ourselves which was a job I passed off to my husband.  Self assembly is doable.  My husband said the instructions were extremely detailed and there was no problem with assembly as long as you read and follow each step.  Youâd better give yourself a few hours for set up and an assistant to help hold pieces in place, etc.I wouldnât hesitate to buy this treadmill.  So far, itâs a great machine!

    Great Product.  IFit is a Joke.
  
",3.0,Joseph B Urchak,"Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  As for the treadmill itself:- Assembly was strait-forward (took a little over 3 hours)- Roomy- I enjoy the small features like fan and blue-tooth/headphone jack- Seems solid, I'm 6'/225lbs and don't feel like it's being battered when I run on it.Now for the bad.  IFit is - for lack of a better term - a money-grabbing joke.  They needed to figure out how to move a one-time purchase into a 'subscription model' profit generator and this is what they came up with...although all the adverts I get for 'extended warranties' are coming in a close second.Highlights (or is it lowlights?)- Free year isn't really 'free' you have to give them a credit card and hope they don't charge you.  Even if you don't do this, you still need to make a login to login to your treadmill.  Luckily, they don't verify so Farts McKenzie is the actual owner of my treadmill.- The benefits of the program (pre-programmed workouts) have been available on workout equipment since the late 90's and didn't require a $400 dollar-a-year investment.- The other benefit (hey it looks like I""m running through mountains!) falls flat when you are staring at an 8'' tablet screen.I like having a treadmill in my home as I don't have the time to get to a gym.  But for spending over a grand I should be able to program a workout, or deal with a small list or preprogrammed workouts.  As it is I have to constantly adjust the speed/incline on the fly as I need to.iFit is a transparent money grab and needs to be put in the garbage.  I will not invest in another treadmill with this garbage, I'll suck it up, get a gym membership and make the time to get there.  It'd still probably cost under $400 a year.

It quit in July, it's now October and 19 emails later NordicTrack still hasn't fixed it.  They send parts and links to YouTube videos on how to replace them, but the problem persists. I thought I was buying from a reputable company but I have since looked online and there are dozens of complaints about NordicTrack, this faulty machine, and their very poor service response.  There are other companies out there, buy from anyone buy but NordicTrack, they aren't the company they used to be.

    Excellent treadmill AFTER you bypass iFit activation Scam
  
",4.0,Ken,"Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2019","









  
  
    
  I upgraded from a 10 year old ProForm.  This review is in some ways a comparison to that treadmill.PROS:Feels very solid and  comfortableReasonably quietVery large running belt25 year motor warrantyAudio jack & SpeakersAmazon's assembler put this together in 75 minutesReasonably pricedCONS:Requires iFit activation/subscription at a monthly cost to operate treadmill (But See bypass below)Monochrome Screen (on the 5"" model) is not very good and without  any real ""track"" displayNo FanNo ""Resume"" option, if you stop the treadmill for more than a minute, you have to re-start from 0 distanceThis is a great treadmill.  But it will not work AT ALL if you do not subscribe to iFit (Monthly cost).  Fortunately there is a way to bypass the iFit activation (See heading below)For $20, the treadmill will be delivered to any location of your home.  This is a very heavy box that required two pretty big guys to carry (with some difficulty).  This is a worthwhile cost if your front door is any appreciable distance from the location where you will be using this treadmill.I used an Amazon assembler to assemble this (As I write this review, Amazon is offering this $90 service, free).  These guys are Pros.  He didn't even open the assembly manual and had this fully assembled in 75 minutes or so.After assembly the treadmill does not work without iFit activation.  In fact a red sheet of paper in large letters is included with the assembly manual which says: YOUR TREADMILL IS LOCKED.  FINAL ASSEMBLY STEP:  GO TO IFIT WEB SITE TO UNLOCK.My personal opinion is that this a scam.  iFit requires a smartphone (what if you don't have one?) and requires giving iFit authorization to deduct the monthly subscription costs directly from your credit card.  I believe that the reason the treadmill is so reasonably priced and delivery and installation is free because of the all the money they are making from the iFit subscription.  Fortunately, there is a way to operate the treadmill without activating iFit (see below)HOW TO BYPASS IFIT: There is an iFit Logo button on the display console.  After assembly, hold down this button until the  Treadmill unlocks (About 20-30 seconds).  Sears posts these instructions on their site.  I respectfully suggest that Amazon should also consider doing this.There are two things about the treadmill that felt like a downgrade from my old Proform (although overall this is a much better treadmill).  This first is the lack of a fan.  The second is the very spartan monochrome display.  It's only 5"" big (small) and does not even have a real 1/4 mile track like every other treadmill.  It has a really small track (like 1/2 inch) that does not really show your progress.  If you like to see your progress on a track while running, skip this model.  Nordictrack makes this same model with a much larger (and color) screen but at almost double the cost which is really hard to justify.The treadmill itself is great.  Smooth, solid and reasonably quiet.  There are built in speakers and an iphone type audio jack.  The running belt is large.  Because of the large running area, this treadmill is a bit larger than other models.

  After years of contemplating buying a treadmill but always deciding it wasn't worth the money since I'd rather run outside and had access to them at the gym, I started looking seriously a few weeks ago. The weather in DC is atrocious right now and at 17 weeks pregnant with 3 other little ones, I wasn't able to find the time to run. I saw this deal and HAD to take the chance. The cost was less than 4 months of gym membership when you factor in child care and would allow me to run at home anytime I wanted. I could run or walk during naptime, while the kids played, etc.I've had it a week and I've used it almost every day. I love it! I can't believe I waited so long to get it! As an avid runner, an athlete and half marathoner this treadmill is perfect. I haven't even used any of the settings yet but the basic machine itself is wonderful (Incline and speed, comfort, etc). Spacious enough to not fall off the back, a wonderful ridge to hold an iPad but still able to see the information display, etc. It's awesome! I see a lot of time spent with it this pregnancy and even in the future once baby #4 is here (running during naps, walking if he won't sleep with him in the ergo, etc). Such a great machine at a great, affordable price.

  I've done a lot of research on treadmills. I've read every single review of this model on Amazon. Yes it took me hours. Now you won't have to.Let me get the one thing that is constantly mentioned in many previous reviews out of the way. You DO NOT need to sign up for iFit to unlock your treadmill. Just press the blue square iFit button once your treadmill is powered on for about 20 seconds and it will go into manual mode. No need for an iFit subscription.There is a lot to like about this treadmill (6.5 S model). Wide space for walking and running comfortably. Plenty strong motor. Easy to use buttons. Very bright 5"" screen. Relatively quiet. Two spacious compartments to hold a drink, etc. A thick lip to hold a tablet, magazine, smartphone, etc.I don't recommend the more pricey 6.5 Si model with the 10"" touch screen unless you absolutely will subscribe to iFit. Otherwise you can use the iFit app on a tablet and sync it with the cheaper 'S' model. (I'm using my treadmill in manual mode.)There are two things stopping me from giving this treadmill a five star review. One is the way Nordictrack essentially scams you into thinking you need to subscribe to iFit to get your treadmill up and running. (Yes you can cancel before your free month expires, but you need to provide a credit card to subscribe and why put your new customers under such a hassle? Especially when you can bypass all this which by the way isn't even mentioned in the instructions!)The second issue is with the treadmill 'motor hood' and 'hood accent'. These two pieces are directly in front of your feet as you use the treadmill. Both pieces cover the motor of the treadmill. The issue is that the hood accent is far too close to your feet as you use the treadmill. Looking at the Technogym treadmills at my fancy local gym not a single one has the hood accent as close to your feet. Essentially you will need to use the treadmill probably 6 inches further back then you might normally in order to avoid hitting the hood accent with your feet. I've only seen this issue mentioned in a handful of Amazon reviews, but I'm not sure how more people haven't noticed this. I'm assuming it's a feature you would not find on a pricer treadmill. I'm using my treadmill for casual walking so it's really not a huge issue, but I am making a point to start further back when I use the treadmill, otherwise my feet could easily clip the hood accent. (For reference I'm 6 ft tall. Perhaps less of an issue with shorter people, and even more of an issue with taller people/longer strides.)You can easily move and store the treadmill by raising from the back and locking into place.Overall I think this is an excellent choice given the price. I don't see anything better currently in the $600 range. And I've looked at just about every treadmill on the market before my purchase.Delivery from XPO logistics was no issue. They came to my home and I pointed to the room where I wanted the box left. It's a big and heavy box!I HIGHLY recommend you have Amazon set up the treadmill. A nice young man came to my home the day after delivery and did it all by himself in about an hour. I tipped him well. Please tip the person that assembles the treadmill. It's not super easy and most people writing reviews said they wish they never tried to do it themselves.Lastly you definitely should get a mat to place under the treadmill to protect your floor. Countless options are available on Amazon.Also when I was searching for treadmills Amazon had by far the cheapest price when it came to both purchase and delivery/assembly. I highly recommend you purchase from Amazon if you are going to get any kind of treadmill.

  Beware before you purchase this treadmill.  It's full of glitz and glamour.  However, unless you have a dedicated 20amp outlet this treadmill will trip your breaker every time you turn it on.  And I had it plugged into a 15 amp breaker with nothing else plugged in.  Called NordicTrack. They told me I had to have an ARC filter due to they type of breakers newer homes use.  Bought an ARC filter.  Still tripped the breaker.  Called again.  Went through a diagnostic with customer support.  Turns out the motor was bad.  I had the choice to wait over a week for a technician to come and replace it or they'll send me a new motor in 2 days and I can replace it.  I ask will I still need the ARC filter with new motor - yes, I will!  $700 for a treadmill that won't work in a modern day home....go figure.  Once I get the new motor, I'll update this review.

    Great equipment, but digital ecosystem fatally flawed
  
",1.0,SmartHomeDad,"Reviewed in the United States October 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  With COVID here for the winter and no access to our gym, we decided it was time for a treadmill. Our needs are pretty basic - the treadmill has to be able to handle two people running 5k about three times a week. I'm a 200lbs  6' guy, and while I don't run fast I do a bit more than jogging. Cheaper treadmills get too wobbly or bouncy at anything beyond a jog. Not this one! The T6.5S does just as well as the one at the gym as far as I'm concerned. The only difference is that the track is a bit more narrow, but it's plenty wide for our needs.Assembly was pretty easy, or so my wife tells me - she put it together almost all by herself (there were a couple parts that are easier with two people). Our only hitch was that after it was all assembled, we couldn't get the panel beyond the ""register at iFit"" screen. We thought we didn't connect the panel properly or something, but after taking some things apart and putting them back together we realized we just needed to attach the safety key. Duh! This was our fault as it does mention this in the instructions. Still, an error message like ""attach safety key"" would have been nice versus an ambiguous ""BEEPBEEPBEEPBEEP"" error.Now - this is all pretty complimentary, so why one star? It's all about the digital ecosystem. This treadmill has bluetooth, which gives it the capability to sync detailed workout stats. However, this feature is 100% worthless due to intentional choices made by Nordictrack and iFit. Bluetooth stat syncing ONLY works with the iFit app. The iFit ecosystem does not integrate with any other ecosystem, like Apple HealthKit, FitBit, Google Fit, etc. The only ways to get your workout stats into those ecosystems are to either 1) input them manually, or 2) do a cumbersome export/import process, every time. This is ridiculous for a treadmill that essentially has this feature built in but intentionally disabled.So to our friends at Nordictrack, if you read this: please reevaluate your partnership with iFit. I understand that everyone wants a recurring revenue model. I understand that Peleton is super successful with theirs. It's totally fine to offer a subscription service for live and on demand workouts. I like the model of offering on an iPad app for that purpose versus requiring a more expensive piece of equipment with an extra touch screen. What is totally NOT FINE is requiring a $15 per month PER PERSON subscription just to sync your workout data.And to our friends at iFit - you are getting the business model wrong. The correct model is to offer a free basic service with a fee based premium service. The free service really needs to do little more that store workout data and offer an API to sync them with other ecosystems. I understand you do not even have this capability today on the paid service. This is almost certainly an intentional decision, but let me be clear: you will never a dominant health ecosystem using only proprietary devices. You just won't. I have no interest in switching all my health hardware to any single vendor. I have no desire to be forced to use your iFit fitness tracker instead of my FitBit or Apple Watch. And you will never keep up with all possible device categories - you don't even have a connected scale. What about sleep monitors? Posture trackers? Blood pressure monitors? Stop. Just let your ecosystem integrate with others like every other successful health company ends up doing.OF NOTE: Previous negative reviews were upset that the seemingly ""required"" iFit activation also required you to input a credit card number to bill you for the monthly service unless you remember to cancel. This is NO LONGER THE CASE - the iFit trial registration does not require a credit card, and you can still bypass the whole thing by holding down the iFit button for 15 seconds. So, this is not what I'm upset about. I'm upset that I would need to pay $15/month/person to use the bluetooth, and even if I did pay I would have to use the iFit app exclusively to track my health data.In conclusion - if you just want a solid treadmill with no digital features, this is a great choice. If you want something that integrates with the rest of your digital heath data, look elsewhere.

  I received the treadmill today and my husband put it together. It is exactly what I was looking for and I'm sure I will be happy with it. Unfortunately, the bottom right rail next to the track is cracked. The box was damaged as well upon receiving but was unable to see the cracked piece until removing all of the contents. I emailed Nordictrack and am notifying Amazon as well and I'm hoping the piece will be replaced and sent out ASAP. Disappointed to receive a new item damaged but should be an easy fix. Otherwise, I'm anxious to start using it.

    Good Treadmill, but InHome Setup is deceptive
  
",3.0,Christopher O.,"Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2018","









  
  
    
  The product arrived on time and the xpo delivery people were kind and friendly.  This has been one of those rare instances where Amazon was not helpful and has made me reconsider making these types of purchases through their website.  While the product arrived in good shape, one of the advertised aspects of this product was FREE in home assembly.  I contacted Amazon on 3 separate occasions trying to get help in this regard.  They reassured me repeatedly that they would get it taken care of and that free in-home assembly was included; however, no one knew how to help me and they just kept transferring me from department to department.  Eventually the home services people called, but just placed me on hold immediately and then hung up.I was left needing to find a way to move and set up a very heavy treadmill.  With some help, it go taken care of...but looking back I wouldn't have purchased the treadmill if I had known that the advertisement for in-home setup is just a ploy that Amazon makes very difficult to make a reality.The treadmill itself is operating well and seems solid.  The controls are not the most advanced, but for the price I feel it is nice.  The operation is not noisy at all for a 6'1 175 lbs person and operates smoothly at running speeds.  The incline and speed changes (10 speeds with fractional speeds in 10ths) are a great feature and good for this price.I will update after 6 months.  Right now I would say its a decent treadmill and I'm glad to have it; however, the set up experience was deceptive and difficult and a service that was part of the purchase was never instigated by Amazon and never performed after multiple contacts.

    Problems since I bought this treadmill
  
",1.0,Ida P. Reaves,"Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2019","









  
  
    
  This treadmill has malfunctioned 3 times since I purchased it.  When the stop key is pressed, if the treadmill does not stop and I press it again, it still doesnât stop but increases the speed from 3.3 mph (my usual walking speed) to 7 MPH. The first time it happened about 6 weeks ago, I had a friend with me and he pulled the key to stop the machine so I did not fall.  The second time it happened was on the 7th of Nov but it was running so fast I couldnât grab the key to stop it and when I did, it stopped but I fell.  The last time it happened was yesterday Nov 19th but I was able to pull the stop key before it increased in speed.  I did however, see the speed increase on the monitor and it was at 7 mph.  Luckily I pulled the key before it sped up.  Thatâs when I called customer support and filed this claim.This machine is extremely dangerous and needs to be remedied.  I want a safe treadmill and not one that will kill me before my time.I have filed an injury claim with the Icon legal team and it is being reviewed and they will look into some options to remedy this problem.

    Mixed Bag, Lots of Negatives, Underwheliming Design Flaws
  
",2.0,DolphinBlue,"Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2019","









  
  
    
  I don't need a lot of fancy stuff on my treadmill, so I was looking at the cheaper ones to replace the one I had for about 5 years that cracked one day while I was jogging. However, that treadmill went to a 10% incline and 10mph, and once I noticed that the cheaper ones only went to 7/7.5 on those measures, I moved up to this price range.I was immediately frustrated that I was REQUIRED to sign up for iFit to use the treadmill.  ARE YOU KIDDING??? Fortunately, the installer (my order came with free installation) told my son a fantastic tip to what I guess he heard as a common complaint.  if you hold down the iFit logo on the console for 15-30 seconds, you can bypass the opening screen and actually use the console/treadmill.  It is ABSOLUTELY ASININE that Nordic Track attempts to force buyers to sign up with iFit.  I can't tell how much of a major turn off that is.PROS- 10% incline and 10 mph- Once you figure out how to bypass the initial console screen demanding an iFit registration, console is pretty easy to use (though instructions are scant on the buttons immediately below the screen, and what instructions there were were not consistent with the screen's behavior)- Unit ""appears"" sturdy but only time will tell- 20 built-in exercise routines, though I am a 'manual workout' person myselfCONS:- See iFit comment above.  ASININE, ABSURD, RIDICULOUS- Plastic protector at head of running board is about 3 inches too close to my feet, so I occasionally land on it while jogging.  Yes, I like to hold the rails and interact with the controls while running.  This was also an issue on my last treadmill.- The cupholders are plastic and  thus quite noisy with a plastic bottle or remote control on them.  Come on, for $600 you could afford a little felt.  I had to insert my own felt to cut down on the ridiculous noise.- The side bars and pulse bars are about 6 inches too low for me (I am 6 feet tall).  They are almost ok at zero incline, but at 7% incline, it is uncomfortable.  I have to stoop over to use the pulse bars.  Again, for $600, it seems like it would have been extremely easy to make the console/side bars adjustable so everyone could be comfortable.- There is no 'pause' button.  You must hit 'stop' and after some indeterminate relatively short time, the console will reset.- When I use the pulse monitor and the reading appears, often it intermittently returns, overtaking the calorie reading, and I haven't figured out how to get that to stop.- Pulse monitor is erratic and does not seem to give consistent, accurate readings.- See comments above re: screen settings- No control buttons (e.g., speed/incline) on hand rails- The incline does not return to zero after you are finished.  This is actually quite shocking.  You have to hit zero to return it to flat before powering off- Console does not power off unless you remove the emergency key; there is no 'off' button for the console.- Instructions tell you to power off AND unplug the machine after every workout!!! Or it will shorten the life of the unit!!! Really?!?!  Fortunately, the power off button is very small and near the floor.  Why not actually put it where it's easy to reach if it's so vital??? Does anybody think about how to best design a treadmill before they build it?

    Better than the $2,000 machine!
  
",5.0,JonQ York,"Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2018","









  
  
    
  In the early 90s - about 25 years ago, I bought a NordicTrack treadmill - for around $2,000.  Recently, I decided we needed one with a shorter ramp because we're running out of space and spot where I wanted to put it - was about 2 inches too short.  And one day while running on the old machine, I looked back at how much ramp space there was behind my feet that I wasn't using and wondered if anyone made a shorter treadmill now.  The ramp on the old machine was like 6 feet long and I really only used the first 3-4 feet of it.I went on Amazon and looked them up and sure enough, to my delight, they make shorter ones now!Since my old one had lasted so long (even though it didn't really get much use!), I decided to go with another NordicTrack despite several negative and disturbing reviews.I was very happily surprised to see these things selling for around $600 now!  But I figured the quality will be worse or it will have fewer features.  When we received it and got it all set up - I was amazed that the quality was as high as it was on the $2,000 machine and happy to see it had all the same features.  The funny thing is - it literally has exactly the same features.  They're just laid out and displayed in a different way.  The buttons for speed and incline are easier to press and far more attractive to look at.The center screen that supposedly has workout programs that you can follow - I find to be totally useless.  I just use it to monitor my progress... how many minutes, how much distance I've done, etc.  But if it has some workout programs in it - it's not instantly obvious how to access them, so I haven't bothered.  I don't care enough about that feature to worry about it.The really nice thing about this newer version is that when you want to put the ramp up (Do they call it a ramp?  Anyway, the thing your feet touch when you're running on it), when you put it up - you can literally do it with the touch of a finger.  You just barely lift it - it's like lifting a 5 pound weight... and the hydraulics take care of the rest.When you put it down, you unlock it and then just let go of it and it will settle down to the floor very gently on its own.  You don't have to lift or hold any weight at all when you put it back down.  On the 25-year-old machine - that thing was seriously heavy and you had to have some real strength to lift it up and down.  Which was fine except it was a little scary - what if you drop it?  And over the intervening 25 years, my back isn't exactly what it used to be!  So it was actually a bit of a problem for my back.  So, this new model is really awesome in this respect.We also bought the $95 assembly package.  The guy who came out was awesome.  He put it together in about 45 minutes.  The thing was a big complicated mess right out of the box.  If I had attempted it - I'm not even sure if I could have finished it.  But if I could have, I am sure it would have taken at least a week!  So, the $95 was well worth it.  Oh and by the way, keep in mind Amazon doesn't really pay these guys all that well.  Amazon takes 40% of that fee.  Why?  I don't know... because they're not doing any of the work or incurring any of the travel expenses.  They really should give these guys 90% of it.  So we left him a good tip.  We knew it had taken him an hour to get to us from the last place he was.  So, for Amazon to pay him just $57 for what amounted to 2 hours of work we didn't really think was fair.All in all I'm very happy with it.  It's not only every bit as good - but it's even better - than the old machine that cost 3x more 25 years ago.

",5.0,Steve T,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2016","









  
  
    
  We received this machine this morning.  I was curious to see what type of delivery we were going to get as it was free with my prime membership, but the delivery guys even brought it downstairs for us (It weighs over 200 lbs), so I wouldn't hesistate to use Amazon again.  I still need to figure out how the iFit works on this machine as it was included in the elliptical we have along with wifi connectivity, but as far as a treadmill goes, it works great.  Assembly did take a while, but we were being very cautious throughout the process.  Make sure you have a good ratchet set because the provided hex key would have been brutal to do manually.  Using my ratchet set, I was able to make sure everything was nice and tight.  Also, follow the directions carefully.  There is a reason they tell you not to tighten the screws all the way sometimes.  Oh and don't forget, like any workout equipment, the machine won't turn on until you put the magnetic key in (with the safety strap).  I quickly realized that after I plugged it in and the screen turned on and then turned off.  We gave it a quick test run so far and the incline works, speeds seem good, it tracks all of the information you expect from a treadmill.  We haven't tried the MP3 input jack yet for music, but we have a TV in front of the unit, so I'm not sure how much we will utilize the speakers anyway.  The cup/bottle holders on each side are nice.  It folds up nicely and the provided pump ensures that it unfolds smoothly and won't come crashing down on your feet if it slips out of your hands.  We plan to get the extended service plan just in case any of the parts go within the first few years (its included in the directions), but it seems pretty solid and I don't anticipate any issues. If I do, I will be sure to update my review.

    For the Price, you can't beat it
  
",5.0,A Rich Diet,"Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2018","









  
  
    
  Without question, there are better and more advance treadmills out there but for the price of this one, you can't beat it. I'm a runner, regularly training for marathons and I feel content saying this treadmill is everything you could need unless you are a competitive sub-6 minute mile runner. I've been using this treadmill for about a month and a half, mostly so I could get runs in with a newborn at home and I haven't been disappointed in any way. I've seen a lot of home treadmills that look very fragile but this one is solid; i'm 180 lbs and run hard and even at various inclines, this thing is a rock. I'm not scared that its going to break or fall apart. I haven't really played with the various training programs built in since I've been following my own running plan but there are quite a few and they do auto-adjust pace and incline which is nice.I elected to put it together myself and it's rather simple, I had the whole thing together and running in maybe an hour? With it being such a sturdy treadmill, it is very heavy. I had it delivered directly into my garage and took everything out of the box there and then moved it piece by piece down to my basement. Most individual pieces are very light except for the running deck/track. I actually did it on my own using a handtruck but I DO NOT recommend doing it with out at least one other person. I was inpatient and couldn't wait for a friend to come and slowly moved the deck down step by step...My only  complaint, which is hardly a complaint since I didn't order it for this feature, is the ""speakers."" There is a 3mm input for your phone or tablet but the speakers are a joke... If you don't care about sound quality, then maybe they're ok but I'd recommend your own headphones. I did mount a TV to the wall in front of the treadmill (with FireTV) which when running at a fast pace, needs to have the volume turned up because the motor is a bit loud (but I don't feel any louder than an average treadmill).If you're in the market for a treadmill and don't want to spend thousands, this is the one.. especially since Amazon offersfree shipping.. which for something over 200lbs, I feel is a deal.

  I ordered this treadmill a few weeks ago and it was delivered last week.  I paid $20 extra to have Amazon delivery (subcontracted) move it to the room of my choice which was the best $20 I have ever spent.  Why?  This thing is sturdy and not the short average online order treadmill.  This is full length gym size.  Not sure what the description review says but it weighed about 250 pounds and was in a 7 foot box.I assembled it in about 2 hours (should have been one but I was distracted by Game of Thrones re-runs).  There were some steps that were a bit hard to see on the instructions but in general it was not tough at all.  Early feedback:- The treadmill is sturdy, doesnt bounce around and fairly quiet for a treadmill- The handles and design are good and well made- The screen is a tad small but works fine- The iFit login is a bit annoying every time but maybe I can figure out how to bypass that- The incline and acceleration buttons and features are easy to use and slick- Love the built in fan and bluetooth- Some of the plastic molding is a bit wonky to snap into place as you build it so if it doesnt look right just keep at it, they eventually will pop into placeAll in all we are really happy with this.  The alternative was a $3500 gym treadmill and I think we made a great purchase.  Will amend if something pops off tonight, besides my knee.

  I bought this model 6.5 S on purpose because it said it was compatible with the iFit... I was aware of a monthly iFit subscription of $9.99 a month for 2 years totalling $220 upfront ... however there is no true compatibility and this machine requires an extra iFit module to be purchased for $150...Very misleading in the pictures and the info.  Wouldnt have purchased this if was really clear it would take another $350 just to have the iFit work on this machine.  Be aware.

    Treadmill that morphs into a purse hanger

  This purchase has been a disaster from day one.  First, it took a month for it to get delivered.  Now a month into using the thing and it stops after five minutes of use.  Of course this started after the return period lapsed.  Now I'm trying to get a hold of the company that handles the warranty and I haven't heard a peep in two weeks.  So I just got myself a big ol' hunk of junk that I use to hang my purse on.

    Safety Key Needed to Bypass iFIT!!
  
",1.0,Meg24,"Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  This review is specifically for setup. As many others have complained about NordicTrack really goes above and beyond to try to scam customers with the iFiT subscription. I paid through Amazon to have my treadmill assembled for me. The tech left the treadmill with all the notices on the display to activate iFiT in order for the treadmill to function. The treadmill will literally be locked and unable to operate. I had already read reviews stating that this could be bypassed by holding down the iFIT button for a few seconds. The tech claimed that the company must have disabled this feature and showed me that holding it down wasnât working. He told me I would have to sign up and then left without the treadmill operating. After a few hours of reading through the manual, going on the website, and trying to connect to both Amazon and NordicTrack customer service with no luck I finally found one random review that mentioned the Safety key/cord. Holding down the iFIT icon will only bypass the subscription if the Safety key is in place. Well mine was no where to be found! I went out to the trash and found it in the packaging at the bottom of the trash that the tech had offered to remove. I really have to wonder if it had been thrown out intentionally. As soon as I put the key in place I was able to bypass iFIT and operate the treadmill in manual. Shame on NordicTrack for misleading customers with a forced subscription and for not making it clear in the manual or customer support info that it is not required. I will be thinking twice before purchasing a NordicTrack product!!

    WARRANTY REQUIREMENTS
  
",2.0,Rob,"Reviewed in the United States September 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  Not listed on this web page are the warranty requirements. A friend stopped by while it was being delivered, and after discussing his experience I learned some surprising details after confirming it with NordicTrack support.1) This treadmill must be placed in a climate controlled room. If it's used in the garage your warranty is void.2) It can't get warmer than 85 degrees while upright. This will stretch the belt, and void your warranty. This is a problem for people like me who go on vacation during the summer, and turn off the A/C while I'm gone (in a triple digit climate).3) This treadmill requires a dedicated circuit. If not, your warranty is void. After hearing it needed a climate controlled room, I figured I'd put it in my office, until I learned that room has a single circuit for all the outlets (like most bedrooms do). An electrician offered to run a dedicated outlet for $400. YMMV.My friend had his NordicTrack warranty voided when the motor died 10 months into ownership. The service guy had a long list of reasons why they can void the warranty. Make sure you know the fine print because repairing a broken treadmill can be expensive.Given this information that isn't mentioned anywhere in this description, I've decided to return the unit. It's not worth the total cost and inconvenience of meeting the unmentioned warranty requirements.

  I really love this treadmill.  I paid the extra $20 to have them deliver it to the basement - WELL worth it.  I assembled it by myself, which took a few hours over 2 nights.  It wasn't the easiest to do, but it is certainly doable by one person.  Also, don't believe the nonsense requiring you to sign up for iFit.  It is BS.  I bypassed it using the instructions another reviewer left and it worked like a charm.  Here they are:  ""HOW TO BYPASSÂ IFIT: There is anÂ iFitÂ LogoÂ buttonÂ on the display console. After assembly, hold down thisÂ buttonuntil the Treadmill unlocks (About 20-30 seconds). Sears posts these instructions on their site.""

    Pretty Disappointed
  
",1.0,fatdogtavern,"Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2019","









  
  
    
  Two of the main reasons I bought this item was because it had the Google Maps app that would allow me to walk some of my favorite roads across the country and I also liked this unit because I wanted an integrated heart-rate monitor.When I assembled and turned on the treadmill I found that to activate my FREE iFit account (That includes Google Maps) I would need to supply Nordicktrack with a credit card number so that they could automatically bill it for $395 a year later as a renewal fee of my iFit membership.With all the stolen and hacked personal information going on everywhere, I don't give my credit card information to ANYONE who does not absolutely need it. I tried calling Nordicktrack to explain that I had ZERO intention of ever renewing my membership with them and just wanted the free year that I was promised but after being on hold for over 20 minutes without speaking to a real person I hung up.As far as the heart rate monitor is concerned it is totally worthless. The numbers jump around like crazy. One second my rate is 109, then it's 131 and then it's 43. The longer you hold onto the inputs the more numbers you get and they never stabilize. Luckily I have my Fitbit tracker on so I know my true heart rate. Still, I paid for an integrated monitor on the treadmill and it is worthless.So instead of walking my favorite roads on Google Maps, I bought a 32"" TV and hung it on the wall in front of the treadmill and instead of a heart rate monitor on the treadmill, I wear a Fitbit. Essentially what I have is a $1,000, vintage 1989 treadmill, which in all fairness seems sturdy and solid, but the bottom line is I definitely would not have bought this model or this brand if I knew then what I know now. Buyer Beware.

    The 6.5Si is worth it for the iFit membership
  
",4.0,Anything,"Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2019","









  
  
    
  I picked this treadmill for two reasons: reviews of the previous version (6.5S) said it was built for running (not just walking), and I wanted the 10-inch screen and accompanying iFit workouts because I tend to get bored. It took two people about 2.5 hours to assemble. One wire wasn't where it was supposed to be and thank goodness for small hands, because I had to reach into the panel and fish it out. I'm new to treadmills, so I don't know how loud it is compared to other machines, but it's louder than I'd hoped. In order to hear the trainer talking (over the motor and my own panting), I have to turn up the volume pretty high -- to a point where the speakers crackle sometimes. Overall the music track is too loud and the trainer track is too soft. Other than that, I have no complaints about the machine.I view the iFit programs/membership as a big part of this product (and the price), and I adore them. The iFit website is hard to navigate: they have so much amazing content, but it can be hard to find the type and level of workout you want. I started with the ""true beginner"" Antarctica series to get used to using a treadmill, and kept with it even though it was maybe too easy for me just because I enjoyed it so much. I'm also VERY grateful for the Iberian Beginner Running Series, which eases you (back?) into running without overdoing it and getting hurt.This was a huge splurge for me, but one I'm glad I made.

  I bought this treadmill in place of a gym membership because I find it extra hard to leave the house in the winter to make it to the gym. This has been a great solution for our family- even my husband likes to get on and go for a walk before work which makes it all worth it. The ifit program is awesome. You can work with a trainer in a gym doing high impact cardio or go for a hike through alps; love the versatility and variety of programs. Much more motivating to have an instructor guiding you through a workout than a traditional walk/run on a treadmill. The touch screen is great, sound is ample and I love the Bluetooth function to stream my own music. Easy to use and has everything you need to keep your work out comfortable. It is like having a nice gym caliber treadmill at home.  The machine is not too loud and belt runs smooth. Cannot say enough about the quality. I will say this - setting it up was a workout in itself - have a good set of pliers as the bolts are a bit tricky. So worth the investment.

  Ok. Before I bought this machine. I read all reviews and I was scared of this investment. Iâm a body builder and cardio is part of my life style. I wanted to make sure that this is the right one for me. I been using this treadmill for 2 days and so far itâs amazing. Assembly toke me 1.5 hr. Nothing hard and all hardware and parts arrived perfect shape. Now In regard to I fit and set up. Man donât stress or sign up for anything. Just once you turn the power on, hold press i fit button for 20 second and boom it will start all programs and you wonât have to worry about it. Donât sign up or nothing.  If you looking to maintain or lose weight. Get this treadmill. its worth the money. As far as the motor Iâll keep update later if I have any issue. Get your 3 years warranty. You need it too.

  Bought the treadmill like 3-4 months ago and it started making noises two weeks ago. Contacted Nordic Track and they told me I need to buy a warranty because I don't have one. Treadmill is making loud grinding noises and is impossible to use but instead of fixing it, Nordictrack is trying to push and expensive warranty on me and even then I don't know if with their ""great"" customer service they'll actually do anything to fix this. I was under the impression that there was a year long warranty on the treadmill already. Never buying another Nordictrack treadmill in my life never mind the fact that I don't know what to do now. I have an expensive broken down treadmill  and no one to help fix it.

    NordicTrack T 6.5 Si Treadmill + 1 Year iFit Membership (WORTH IT!) with the 10-inch screen
  
",5.0,Matthew Creel,"Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  This review is for the NordicTrack T 6.5 Si Treadmill + 1 Year iFit Membership (WORTH IT!) with the 10-inch screen.I have owned this treadmill for 5 months 1 day as of the current date/writing of this review (May 9, 2020).This is the first treadmill I have ever owned (I actually bought it as a gift to my girlfriend) and it has been awesome! She loves it too, of course.Assembly: 4/5 - The assembly was interesting, to say the least, but with the help of my girlfriend, it took us between an hour or two to finish. I'm pretty sure it was much closer to two hours. I do not think it is possible to assemble by yourself but kudos to you if you manage to get it assembled on your own. Then again, try it by yourself and you'll be so worked up from not having an extra 30 pairs of hands to help that you'll be ready to run 30 miles when it's all said and done. I personally would not recommend it, though. You, in some instances, need someone to hold the upper half of the frame while the other is screwing stuff in to anchor it all together. I mentioned the assembly was interesting earlier in the sense of how everything eventually came together so perfectly. There's always one or two small hiccups with getting a screw hole to align...maybe it is just me but that seems to always be expected when I put anything together. I do recall having a slight issue where some wires on the right-hand side needed to be tucked away. I think we were able to rig it so they stayed put so no real big issues there - they are actually run through/inside the right bar that stands vertically touching the floor. The only bar connecting the bottom of the treadmill to the top...it's maybe at a slight 20-degree angle. Anyways, those particular wires are used to connect either the speakers, monitor, or both. Either way, you have to have them. I rate the instructions and everything assembly related a 4/5 deducting one star because you need a second person. As far as how well written the instructions goes and the lack of wtf's that DIDN'T happen, much (which is good by the way), I rate that a 5/5.Quality: 5/5 - I personally think the quality of the treadmill, build materials, the built-in 10 inch screen, speakers, and any other random odds and ends to be pretty good quality. There is a lot of plastic but it all feels solid and sturdy and should last for many, many years to come.Noise: 5/5 - I think the noise is about as quiet as you can make a treadmill. Then again, if you're running in place on something suspended off the ground then there are bound to be thuds with each step...I speak from firsthand experience. The speakers get quite loud so that's good noise if you are playing music or watching some of the iFit videos which will be discussed further down but not TOO far in-depth since I want to keep my review specifically on the treadmill itself. Yes, I realize iFit is more...fit...to be in the feature section below yet here it is. :)Features: 4.5/5 - If you want some good bells and whistles without dropping three grand on a Ferrari-like treadmill this is absolutely more than enough. Especially if you're like me and have never owned a treadmill before. It is a 10-speed treadmill with 10 levels of incline that increment from being flat (0.0) all the way to (45-degree angle upwards maybe?)10.0 at 0.1 increments. The iFit membership I think is stunning! Running in another country or hillside with a trainer all while enjoying the scenery (don't wimp out on monitor size or this is less enjoyable) while getting a good workout makes using this treadmill so much more enjoyable/pleasant. I'm not sure what the little orange/yellow cushion things are called but they are there as support for your joints. When you land, from jogging or running, they squish down to reduce the impact on your knees and other joints. I thought they looked silly but now that I know how well they work and what they are for I don't think they are so funny anymore. The other features you can more easily see from viewing the posted pictures. Cupholders, how big the speakers are, buttons, other little knickknacks. I have not had to use the folding feature of the treadmill to ""tuck"" it away in a corner but I did enjoy playing with the feature when putting it together. I have only used it honestly like 2-3 times and from what I could tell it works well. I do like that there is a ""no slam"" feature where if when you are letting it down and it slips it won't come crashing down. It will catch itself and slowly lower itself down automagically safe and sound...so that's neat. I docked half a point because the heartbeat sensor(s) you put your hands on don't really work all that well. I don't expect them to be 100% perfect or accurate by any means but I found that I have to, more of than not, situate my hands jusssst the right way for it to start giving me a readout. No biggie for me personally, since I have a Fitbit watch, but for anyone out there who is curious...it doesn't work very well for me personally. You might not have any issues with yours but I do with mine. Again, no deal-breaker for me by any means.iFit Membership: 5/5 - This I am going to briefly touch on and recommend everyone visit the NordicTrack website under the iFit section. I would post a link but I don't know if Amazon filters those out or not so I'll leave it up to you to learn your way around google. There is a TON of information there if you are interested for more information. Our purchase included the 1-year free iFIt membership. I am pretty certain that alone is a $300 value. What I like about it the most is that my girlfriend and I have created our own accounts and can share the membership. This way I can track my workouts and she can track hers on our own unique accounts. Logging in and out is pretty seamless (couple touches and you're logged in). I believe once you login once it doesn't log you out automatically so it's a matter of swapping accounts based on who is about to workout. You can keep track of things such as what days we worked out on, what workout we did, for how long, calories burned, and a LOT more. The membership is honestly a really great idea though. Just make sure you have your treadmill somewhat close to your modem or router (for Internet). Like most things nowadays...the videos need to be streamed while you are viewing them. Aka, you need to be online and connected to the Internet. So be aware of your placement when deciding where to put your treadmill.I hope this review has helped anyone on the fence as to what they want for their next treadmill.Happy treading!

  Ok, first of all, what's up with these B(ogu)S reviews? I got a fairly good bargain on this machine and it came brand new. Keep reading though.Took me about 1 hr to set it up. Only tool that didn't come in the set was a x(14mm, I think) wrench which was fine. I was able to set most of it up myself to the point where I was walking on it in no time. Only part you need a person 2 is when installed the hydraulic bar.First impressions:Really nice. The incline is smooth, belt pull is powerful with the 2.6 HP engine. I barely have any room now to walk around in my room, but with this baby I will be having my beach body in no time.--Contrary to popular belief, it does not squeak while running on it. At the time of writing this, I weigh around 240lb, 5' 11"" and I am able to comfortably walk incline and run on this machine in a carpet setting.Some people think that you need to purchase the iFit membership to use the machine.... THIS IS NOT TRUE. I simply put it together, then put the magnetic emergency fitbit on the bar, PUSH AND HOLD the iFit Bluetooth button for a few seconds and it'll beep and over-ride the screen.Will update if I have any problems although I doubt it. Am very satisfied with purchase

  The delivery people brought the treadmill right in to room of choice and unboxed and removed all the trash. I laid out all the parts and they are well marked right or left. The hardware is all separated by step as in the manual shrink wrapped to cardboard and labeled by step. The manual assembly instructions are very good. I noticed that the steel supports are really heavy gauge steel and well anchored to the treadmill base. The assembly was pretty straight forward and I did it all myself with the help of a ratcheting tie down strap. I used this to hold the treadmill base up while I did the steps underneath the base like the hydraulic holdup support for when you fold up the treadmill. This hold up support is great, it helps when folding the unit and slowly lowers the base to the floor to use. The only negative thing I can see about the treadmill is the lock on the treadmill mill until you log into ifit and give them info so they can charge your account every month. Itâs like planet fitness you give your checking account info and they charge monthly and make it hard to cancel. This is very bad move by NordicTrack and should be discontinued! I should not have to signup for a service that is in fact part of Icon Fitness along with NordicTrack. Now you can bypass this by pressing the ifit button and hold down about 30 seconds. This didnât work for me and I was upset until I read you have to have your safety key in place for anything to work! Guess what, I didnât have the key in place. I put it in place and treadmill starts right up. The thing I wonder is wether NordicTrack does away with the bypass which would be criminal and I wouldnât buy this. As far as I can see the product is well built and functions well. I will revisit this review with updates as I see how product and service goes. We have been using this treadmill for a while now and it is actually fairly quiet as compared to our last treadmill.

  You must have an iPad to use this device as shown in the pictures and video.  I should have looked closer.  I'm right at 300lbs, which is its max weight rating.  When I walk on it, I can feel the belt momentarily hesitate with each footfall.  Hopefully this will improve as I lose weight, which is my goal.  The most annoying ""feature"" is that if you touch any of the controls after you start your workout, it will stop completely and you have to start over.  Even if you've been walking or running for 22 mintues, you better know which buttons you can push to keep it going. This is the only treadmill I've ever seen that works this way.  There is NO PAUSE button.  So if you have to stop for a minute to refill your water, or if you accidentally push one of the buttons, you're done and have to start over.It went together okay, but you can't do it alone.  You need help.  And plan on ONE screw not going in right.  It's not idiot-proof by any means, and trust me on this one, I'm an idiot.  LOLThe heart monitor doesn't seem to work very well, though I do have an alternative method for monitoring that.  It says it has it, and it should have it.  It doesn't work.So if you can find a cheaper one that you don't have to pay extra for stuff that doesn't work, if you weigh 300lbs or more, or if you don't have an iPad, get the cheaper one.  What happened to NordicTrack?

",1.0,Ellen Parker,"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2021","









  
  
    
  Treadmill delivered today. Delivery was smooth. Assembly was difficult but we got it done. Registered with IFit as instructed. Downloaded the app, then decided to switch to manual. Turned on the treadmill without a problem, I calibrated the incline as instructed in the manual, set the speed to 1 mph and started walking. When I increased the incline, it went up to level 10 and stayed there. Absolutely stuck! Fortunately, I had registered my treadmill with NordicTrack. I called customer service who walked me through trouble shooting. Nothing worked. The rep, who was very patient and courteous by the way, said it was a problem with the display not communicating with the incline function/motor/sensor. A new controller is being sent but will take 7-10 business days. All this on day 1! Iâm tired and frustrated. Iâll update my review once I install the new controller.Update: Installed new controller. Incline still stuck. Called customer service who suggested I perform calibration. That didnât work either so Iâm being sent a new incline motor. Sigh!Update: Based on problems from the start, I began to question this treadmillâs overall reliability.  I made the decision to return. I will say that NordicTrackâs customer service was courteous and responsive.Parting thoughts: Unpacking as well as assembly was cumbersome and difficult. Screw holes didnât always line up and screws often took a great deal of strength to drive in properly. Instructions werenât as clear as Iâd hoped, despite multiple mediums including the Bilt app.Parts can take over 7-10 business days to arrive and can be a challenge to install. After reading other reviews questioning price fluctuations and whether this treadmill may be a returned or refurbished item, Iâm beginning to wonder the same. On the plus side, customer service from NordicTrack and Amazon was excellent. If you have the time and patience to work through assembly and mechanical issues, this could be a great machine. The belt ran smoothly, if only for a few minutes, the folding mechanism is convenient and simple to operate and the display panel is bright and clear.

    HUGE Flaw in this machine
  
",1.0,Liendeni,"Reviewed in the United States December 16, 2018","









  
  
    
  There is one huge flaw in this machine...and that is if you intend to use the incline feature you will no longer be able to reach anything out in front of you, meaning you can not reach your water bottle...music device...digital read out display...or even to use the heart rate grip handles.  If you look at the machine in the pictures...you will notice a black plastic insert that runs on top of the actual tread mill just below the display.  As you incline the machine...this part of the treadmill comes closer to you....meaning you have to move more backwards on the machine in order to avoid stepping on it.  You have to move back so far that you literally have to bend over at the waist just to use the heart rate grips.  I found myself keep having to step on the sides off the treadmill and stop my walk anytime I wanted to change my music or change a feature on the unit.  Very very frustrating. If you walk for say 30 to 60 minutes and you watch videos on youtube or something like that...you will have to literally stop walking and step off the machine as many times as the videos run out...or your music choice changes.  I don't hold onto the rail in front of me anyway, but if you are someone who does...you will not be able to do so with the unit inclined.  You will keep stepping on the plastic piece and can literally injure yourself the first time you do it.  Machine seems nice otherwise but this is to huge of a flaw to give it anything but 1 star.  I guess everyone else is not using the incline feature.  And no...I am not 8 feet tall....with long legs. Only 5'10"" and my wife is 5'1"" and has the same issue.  Just note the above and take into consideration when purchasing. I wouldn't buy this unit again...and already put together and box tore up to return.  Frustrating.

    Defective motor

  Defective  motor was out on setup. Customer service was not very good. I am stuck with a treadmill until Friday that will not run. Also the treadmill was suppose to come with assembly and shipping. The system didn't work right so we had to wait another week for the technician Tom while he was good he suggested I call Nordic track. 5 hours of calling to find out the machine has a bad motor in it. This was not a good experience! If there was a zero I would put it!

  I am 218 pounds and 5'10. It shakes a little when I am on it. The handrails are a bit short and the front plate should be further up so people that want to stand really close to the console are able to do so without stepping on it and tripping.All that said I love this treadmill. I personally feel it is sturdy, I LOVE the one touch buttons to change speed and incline. I don't know why I didn't buy one of these for my home sooner. I got a good sweaty workout as soon as my ex boyfriend set it up for me!  He set it up basically by himself but the delivery men put it where we needed it (for a fee) so we did not have to move the heavy box at all. The large cups hold my remote, my hydroflask, and my cell phone, while the lip of the console holds a book (with a book opener clip holding it open hands free).Lastly, holding down the ifit button for 30 seconds did not work even after multiple attempts. I bit the bullet and put in my credit card. I was able to immediately cancel the membership online via ifit.com > my account > cancel benefits.Pro Tip: watch a youtube vid on assembly, there are multiple.I am very pleased with my purchase!I will update if I get charged for ifit or if the machine malfunctions in anyway.

    ifit Account Required
  
",1.0,Sarah N.,"Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2019","









  
  
    
  In order to use this treadmill it seems like you are required to create an account with ifit including giving them all your personal contact information, and your credit card information!  You can cancel the ""free"" trial after the 30 days but I find it outrageous that corporations can get away with this kind of invasion of privacy.  I should be able to use the treadmill I paid good money for without being forced to give away all my personal information to another company so that they can profit from it.  Luckily I found out that you can override the registration to use it by holding down the ifit button for 10 seconds, but that is nowhere in the manual or instructions.  Nordic Track and ifit should be ashamed of their predatory policies.

    Ok overall
  
",2.0,Scotty Greek,"Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2020","Overall seems OK for the price, size and features - would go for another treadmill in the future.

bad stuff.

Belt
-Belt is closer 19 7/8â not 20â - not a huge deal I guess but, I expect actual measurement to be listed, not what they round it up to - especially since these seem to be largely priced out based on how wide the belts are. Belt also seems to flip up slight on the edges.

Lubricant
Belt is self self lubricated so that is good. What I do not like is that they want you to call them if you think the belt needs lubricant. Iâm assuming that is so you pay for one of their service people (or vendor that they get cut in on) or try to get you to sign up for a plan. They should just list reasons lubrication would be needed and a recommended lubricant. Updated 12/15/20 - the belt seems to slow down each step when you walk on a slow speed. Not sure if thatâs a normal thing but. Iâve tightened the belt quite a bit and donât want to anymore at risk of damage. It is also kind of tough to tighten each side. You basically have to fish around with the Allen key on each side.

Ifit
I guess they want you to login and create a profile with a credit card. It doesnât say it anywhere that you can just hold the Ifit logo for something like 10 seconds to bypass it.

Tools
They just have the Allen key included (used to assemble and adjust belt) but you also need to a philips screw driver (which most people have) and a wrench (would be a real pain to use a regular wrench) I used a ratcheting with a 3â extension. Considering how expensive these things are, they could included more tools and design it to were everything is more accessible.

Board
There seems to be 2 random screw holes on the bottom of the board - maybe for an add on item? Maybe they donât have much quality control and something else is messed up.

Good stuff.

Heavy and sturdy
When assembled it seems very sturdy and hopefully built to last.

Display
Easly accessible and you can adjust speed/incline by pressing arrows or number (1-10)

Price
We got this, this month for $659.55 - for a machine with what they call a 20â belt (19 7/8â) and the incline/decline it seemed to be a good price.

Tips - I recommend not tightening the base screws too tight until your done assembling. It mentioned this at the end of the instructions, I do not recall seeing this at the beginning.

    Only audio Bluetooth available
  
",4.0,Kylie,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2019","









  
  
    
  Overall this treadmill is very good and gets the job done, however for its price point I will nitpick at a few things that bothered me. The setting up process was a bit tedious and took a few hours, no big deal, however one of the side arms did not properly fit into the main console and it took a while to jimmy it around to get the holes to align properly for the screws, it fits but there are pieces of the plastic that arenât sitting right. My biggest complaint is with the ifit program on the screen, if youâre looking to be able to sync your treadmill to the ifit cardio app (the blue one) you cannot do this with this model. As we found out, this model does not have the option to press the ifit button to allow you to enter a code on your phone and sync the two products via Bluetooth, only audio Bluetooth is available. However, you ARE able to keep track of your progress with the ifit coach app (the green one). While there is no Bluetooth syncing that takes place between the treadmill and your phone, logging into your ifit account allows the phone to simultaneously keep track of your steps, what trails youâve done, how many miles you ran/walked, etc which is nice. My only con is that we had to do a little digging to figure out which app actually worked with this model, and I would have liked it to have been more clear in the paperwork that came without the treadmill.

    A nightmare to activate
  
",1.0,EMM,"Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2019","









  
  
    
  The treadmill looks great.  However, they don't tell you that once you buy it for $599.00 + tax, get it assembled ($150.00 although this was included for this deal) -- you can't just plug it in and use it!!!  You have to first sign up for ifit membership (whether you want it or not) -- 30 day free trial, but you still have to provide your credit card information and remember to go cancel it after 30 days if you don't want to continue getting charged.  The reason for the 1 star (there is no 0 star option), is that I still can't get it activated!!!  I've signed up for the ifit membership and I got a nice email that said that the machine was unlocked and is ready to go... BUT the treadmill display still says go to ifit.com/activate -- product live customer support is only during US business hours Mon-Friday... so although delivery and assembly were completed on a Friday evening, the machine is useless until they are back on Monday... Warning for future buyers:  Buy it knowing that getting to actually use it is not as easy as just plugging it in.  I am very disappointing that I won't get to use it over the weekend... And depending on if the activation gets resolved on Monday, I may have to return it, which will be a hassle after getting it assembled... The person who assembled did not mention this little tibit of needing to ""activate it"" beyond plugging it in until he completed the assembly...

  Don't buy this.  I bought this treadmill.  The first thing you see once you unpack is a big red sign, saying your treadmill is locked and you MUST visit iFit and accept their membership to get your treadmill unlocked.  You must give them your credit card number and although your first month is free, then they will charge you $15.00 a month, unless YOU cancel.  What a scam.  I paid over $700 bucks for this treadmill, put it together and I still have to pay to get it unlocked.  I could understand if they offered the iFit as extra and additional coaching helps to buy if you were interested, but to actually lock your own property and force you to give them credit card information?????

  NordicTrack honestly has some down right criminal tactics in order to make it seem like you have to buy a subscription in order to actually use the treadmill, They count on setting up a free trail you will forget about so they can continue to bill your account 15$ every month. Like they didn't just sell you an 800$ piece of equipment. The truth is you don't need a subscription, or contact them. you just have to press and hold the IFit button on your treadmill for about 30 sec, and it can be used as normal. The treadmill itself isn't bad... but nothing special either. if only i had done my research about this company i wouldn't of supported such shady tactics. The only reason i gave it one star is because no stars wasn't an option. Despite what they lead you to believe you never have to interact with this company. Don't visit their god awful website, support their criminal behavior, or give them your card's information.

    Delivery logistics nightmare
  
",4.0,KayB,"Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  The delivery was so unreliable because Amazon handed it off to XPO and despite multiple calls and sms confirmations, they delayed the delivery and only after I complained to an Amazon rep was it scheduled and delivered on time again. The delivery guys delivered it inside the door but it's really heavy so if you want it moved somewhere you will need strong people to move it.From an assembly point of view - it took my husband and me around 3 hours with a tool kit to assemble it. The instructions were really clear with no scope for confusion and all the parts were labeled really well. Thanks to the multiple reviews with the trick to not have to register to iFit, we were able to start the treadmill without signing up or paying anywhere. The screw and bolt for the part that helps in folding the treadmill is very weird and we were unsuccessful in getting that fixed but since we do not intend to fold it and the treadmill stays in the basement it wasn't a show stopper for us.Performance wise it's been a few weeks since it was put to use and there are absolutely no complaints. Very easy to use, feels exactly like a regular gym treadmill.

    The product is good - but the installation is a hassle
  
",3.0,AD Boy,"Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2018","









  
  
    
  I had concerns ordering this. Many people had bad experiences and I had one too. This thing is heavy - 200 pounds. So if the item is mishandled improperly, there is going to some damage to the plastic covers (it's very flimsy) and there is no protection on the side, Mine was broken when it came. So I called Amazon on the same day and they approved it immediately. I asked what to do about the installed one. The lady on the line said to dismantle (wrong info)  and put in the box, I forgot to check the return information in my amazon account (my bad). It said that the person who will come will dismantle and take it, but I did it anyway, because of the original info from Amazon support.The installation is pretty straightforward, but you do require one more hand and then go methodically over the instructions. The console support stands are a problem when screwing, so recommend you tilt it to the side and screw them in. The screws are tight. The unit requires 20 amp actually. My 15 amp breaks the circuit (with both units). The good and the bad:Pros- The unit is sturdy and looks nice. The speaker connection is nice.- In low speeds, the unit is quiet- The dampers allow you to run without much force on your feet- the one touch incline is quite nice- the heavy duty motor is good- The 20"" wide walking belt is great- The hydraulic support for folding the treadmill is genius.Cons- The Unit is very heavy. Requires two persons to assemble without risk of injury.- Some assembly routines are hard to do- Bolts are hard to do manually.- Not easy to move around because of the weight. Wheels are not that helpful to move it around the room.- Don't count on support from NordicTracCheck the unit when it arrives. If there is damage, call Amazon and let them know. They will ship a replacement. Don't try to assemble it, because it may end up being a waste of time.

    Great Treadmill For Beginners and Experienced Users
  
",5.0,Maximillian M.,"Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  This was my first treadmill purchase and I spent several weeks researching various models and reading product reviews to become as informed as possible. To start with, my wife and I LOVE our new Nordic Track! Is it perfect? No. Those who reserve 5 stars for only a perfect item will never rate anything 5 stars. It is a very good treadmill in my experience and while I did read of some people having technical issues, that has not been my experience. I have been regularly using my treadmill for 3 months now, so I do have a decent amount of experience with it in order to leave a fair review.One of the things I really like about this treadmill is the iFit compatibility. There are so many different types of workouts you can select with a full range of beginner to experienced in all categories. You can choose walking, hiking, running, cross-training, walk-run, etc. and there are several series for beginners and advanced users as well. Weight loss, running series, incline series, and more. They have a great assortment of trainers and the treadmill syncs to the workout you choose and adjusts the speed and incline automatically throughout the workout. You do have the ability to easily override the auto adjustments in case you need to slow it down or want to speed it up more, but it is really nice being able to just focus on form and enjoy the workout without having to change speed and incline throughout.I assembled the treadmill myself and it was very easy to do. Only the last part required a second person to assist and in total, it took me about 2 hours from start to finish. The instruction manual is concise and easy to follow. I was missing two small screws that secure the cup holders in place, but one call and they were quickly shipped out to me and arrived 3 days later. These missing screws did not prevent me from using my treadmill in the meantime.I don't fold my treadmill regularly as I don't need the floor space, but I did include a picture of the folded position so you can see how it looks. If you have a lack of floor space but still want a treadmill, this may be the answer. The motor is not very loud in my opinion. It is a treadmill and there is going to be some noise. When the incline is increasing or going down, the noise is more distinct, but it really does not sound louder than one should expect to hear from a motor raising and lowering a heavy treadmill with someone on it.The incline has a range of 0-10 and that is perfectly good for where I am at. I suppose endurance runners and very advanced users may want more of an incline, but it is ideal to me. The speed range is from 1-10 miles and I have only taken it up to 6.5mph so far. Maybe one day I will hit 10mph and wish I could go faster, but I think I am pretty good with the speed range for a long time.I purchased the 3-year maintenance warranty on Amazon and recommend it if only to have it professionally serviced once per year. I do not want to have to deal with extra out of pocket costs if something breaks down and for $89, you can hardly go wrong. You will see when you register your treadmill on the Nordic Track site that they will offer you the same coverage, but it is a lot more expensive. Buy it through Amazon.Finally, some people don't like the iFit membership cost. It is $15 per month or $39 per month for a family plan. I received 2 free months with my purchase and renewed it as soon as my free trial was up because it's such a great feature. If you do not want an iFit membership, you can still use the treadmill in manual mode as well as the 20 preset programs the treadmill comes with. I think it would still be a great treadmill without iFit, but I encourage you to at least use the free iFit trial period before deciding you don't want it.The other models of this treadmill include bigger screens and higher inclines. I may upgrade myself in 3 years, but if you want a great first treadmill, I highly recommend this one.

  Uh-MAZING. I paid for assembly and delivery to the exact room where my treadmill would go. After months of stalking treadmills online, scouring Offer Up, and diving deep into the Reviews sections of websites, I decided to go with this treadmill as my quarantine machine. Honestly, I wish like heck I had just taken the plunge sooner because this has been one of the BEST purchases of my year. I'm not the best runner, but I like to get a good sweat in and wanted something that offered at least up to 10mph of speed. This treadmill offers that and level 10 incline. The fold-up mechanism is also brilliant! It's so easy and there's some sort of suspension thing that make folding it up/down a breeze. I have had no problems with this treadmill and I've used it every day since owning it--usually, walk/run/sprinting anywhere from 2-4 miles. There are pulse-tracking sensors on the handles, but I don't use them because I have an iWatch. I also don't use the Bluetooth speaker stuff because I prefer to use my Alexa as it works better to annoy my Slytherin upstairs neighbors. All-in-all, I'm enamored with this treadmill and honestly wish I had gotten this thing as soon as the pandemic hit so that ""quarantine fifteen"" would have been in the opposite direction on the scale. This is a great piece for the casual runner and you can get your workout in any time of the day. For reference, I'm about 5'10, weigh around 185, and have a pretty long stride. The treadmill has a bit of a quake when I run, but it doesn't feel unsturdy. Final take-away: This is a good little machine. Spring for the assembly if you don't like lifting a 200-pound box and doing spatial math. You won't be disappointed!!! Can't recommend her enough! :)

Everything at initial intake is via computer only. We are on day two and have had no contact from Nordic Track. For the amount of money you spend contact should be a human not a computer!Update cutomer service finally contacted us 1/18/20 via email only. They still aren't sending a technician out to fix it. Very dissatisfied with service on a high price item.Second update 1/21/20. ICON fitness parent company to Nordic Trac still hasn't called or emailed regarding a service visit.I finally called Amazon Product Support and they were great! The machine was not broken but needed to be reset. This machine needs to be plugged into a surge protected power strip. Power outage tripped the electronics up and that is why it wasn't working. The gentleman that helped me at Amazon was very good. But Nordic Trac customer service was No help at all. So for that reason I am only upgrading the review to three stars.

  This treadmill is a great value. I paid close to double the amount for a treadmill with less features approximately 5 years ago. At home equipment keeps getting better and cheaper!Amazon coordinated the delivery service and that was a tremendous value. I was very happy that I paid for it here. To coordinate the same service through NordicTrack's website was going to cost triple the Amazon price.I consider myself to be pretty handy, but this still took me about an hour to assemble. Nothing terribly difficult, just time consuming!I don't love the graphical user interface and the fact that it works over WiFi. I tend to use manual workout mode, so the extra features aren't very desirable to me. Starting a manual workout is pretty easy and quick though. It's not really a negative - I just don't care for it.This treadmill provides a smooth, steady, and quiet ride.

    Assembly straightforward, can bypass iFit, belt keeps shifting all the way to left
  
",4.0,NYCBuyer,"Reviewed in the United States November 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've had this treadmill now for over two months and have been using it fairly consistently for almost 6 weeks now. I walk and briefly run on it 4-5 days/week. I assembled it by myself, and can tell you while it is possible, it will be much easier to do it with help. For reference, I'm a 44yr old, 5'2"" female. The hardest part was putting in the storage latch bar, which definitely screams for another person to hold the tread up while putting the bar in. After assembly, kept trying to bypass the iFit membership requirement but failing before realizing the emergency stop clip has to be on before you can bypass iFit. After that, started walking on it. By 3rd day, saw that the belt was shifting to the left until it was right against the side of the track. Read the instructions on how to fix this, but the fix was very short-lived. Have not been able to fix and the belt is all the way over to the left of the track. It hasnt jumped over the edge of the track though and hasnt caused any issues so I just use it while continuously monitoring the situation. Basic treadmill that does what it needs to, so fairly satisfied with my purchase for the price I paid. That could well change depending on how long it continues to work without issues. The warranty is also NOT 1 year, but a disappointing 3 months. Was not pleased to see that in the paperwork packet.

  Machine is noisy.  I contacted the company regarding it and another question--the reply was ""we will get back to you"" and that was  weeks ago!  The ""whine"" seems to be the belt or perhaps the motor (that seems to hesitate when first turned on.  Also, it ""squeaks"" when I walk (I weigh 135, and don't use it for running.)  I had another brand machine that I had used for over five years and replaced it with this one.  Not a good decision.  .

    Honest Review of the Entire Process - Purchase/Assembly/Use
  
",4.0,mjteach1,"Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2021","









  
  
    
  I've been looking for a treadmill for quite awhile, and while I would have loved to buy one from Peloton, I didn't want to wait around until May, and I also didn't want to spend a fortune.  Believe me, I thought that purchasing a treadmill under $1000 was a risky proposition, but ultimately, I am very happy with T6.5S from NordicTrack.Let me start by saying I was skeptical about the price of $697 from Amazon.  Why was it marked down so much?  I think I discovered this when the treadmill was delivered to my home.  Be aware that this treadmill comes in a very large box and weighs 200 pounds.  I paid the extra $20 for it to be delivered to the room of my choice; which was down a flight of stairs that has some pretty tight corners.  I live alone, so this was absolutely the best option.  Unfortunately, I wasn't able to open the box (which had some pretty severe gouges/rips in it, by the way) until that evening.  Had I been able to open it with the delivery crew present, I would have sent it back immediately.  The side rail (made of mostly plastic) had ripped from the MDF underlayment (surface just under the tread), and had shattered in multiple places.  I discovered this after removing several of the parts and packaging.Well, I went right to my computer and contacted Amazon chat support to inform them of the issue.  They were great, actually, and immediately scheduled the delivery of a replacement treadmill.  I boxed the damaged treadmill back up, though the email from Amazon that I received a moment later told me that was unnecessary as the Amazon staff that were to pick up the damaged treadmill would bring packing materials.So, a week later the delivery men for the new treadmill showed up.  They immediately told me they wouldn't deliver the treadmill down to my basement, but after I told them that I paid for that service and argued a bit, they agreed to.  I have to warn you, the design of the packaging of this treadmill is pretty poor.  If it is rested on a corner of the box, or even the side with any force, it will likely get damaged.  It might be a good idea to warn the delivery guys about this before they transport it to the room of your choice.  I also now wonder if Amazon tried to pawn off the damaged one to me initially, knowing full well it was damaged.  I guess I'll never know.In any case, the new treadmill made it to my basement unharmed.  After unpackaging all of the parts (carefully placing the foam inserts aside in case I had to repackage it), I was confident that nothing had been damaged in transport.  I then read the entire assembly manual, which I highly recommend doing, so that you know what is coming.  After getting the necessary tools (Screwdriver, adjustable wrench, and a socket set if you have one), I assembled the treadmill in about an hour and a half.  I was able to do it myself, but it would certainly be easier with two people; particularly the point where you have to hold the treadmill up at an angle while you assemble the piston that allows you to lift it up and down for storage if you want to (I just leave mine down).Once the entire treadmill was assembled, I plugged into the wall with a power strip (also, recommended) and turned it on.  Yes, I'm sure you've read all of the other emails about the requirement to sign up for iFit.  Well true, the iFit icon does show up on the screen, and there is a bunch of documentation in the packaging about it, but as everyone else has mentioned, you just hold down the iFit logo button on the keypad for about 15-20 seconds and the warning will go away.  Note: you need to have the safety/Stop magnet applied to the grab bar, or this process won't work.  Also, I've notice that you only need to do this the very first time you power the treadmill on; on every subsequent power-up, it goes straight to the regular dashboard.As far as the functionality of the treadmill goes, it's actually pretty great, and just what I need.  It's quite simple with settings for incline and speed (both up to 10) and I like that I can just touch '5' for 5 mph if I want to, instead of using the up or down arrows.  There are some other features for different workouts that I haven't used yet, but I'm sure I will get to them.  I've also discovered that it is very important to have the treadmill on a very flat surface.  Otherwise, the tread will shift to one side.  Even with the slightest incline in my floor, I noticed this a little bit.  Once I figured out the best placement though, it was fine.  Also, I noticed that the surface under the tread was virtually free of oil (probably from laying around in the Amazon warehouse for some time), so I purchased some silicone-based treadmill oil that you apply every 50 miles or so, and it works great!  The display also comes with speakers installed, which guess you can plug your iPhone or iPod into with an auxiliary cord.  Not sure I'll ever do that, as I just have headphones.  Also, the sensitivity of the pulse meter on the grab bar has been hit or miss.  Oh well, can't have everything.So, was the process a bit of a pain?  Well, yes, but overall, not too bad, and well worth it for the price.  I'm totally satisfied with this treadmill and it does everything I need it to do.

  We have had our Nordic Track treadmill for about 3 months now and love it.  I bought it as a way to continue walking exercise during the dark rainy winter months and assumed I might try the iFit training but would never use it.  I was very wrong.  The iFit has been a huge part of my success with the machine.  The treadmill itself is great, the delivery was fairly easy (we had to unbox it and take it to the basement in pieces, but it worked) and assembly was okay but there was a broken piece on ours which made the assembly much harder than it should have been.  We did contact Nordic Track customer service and they were very helpful and got replacement parts to us quickly.  We all use the treadmill and I love the iFit training.  At first I would just watch the walking tours as I walked to keep myself entertained (London, Edinburgh, Portugal, Morocco, etc) but then was enticed to start doing some interval running and walking.  I am not a runner, never have been, but though using the iFit programs with trainer Tommy Rivers Puzey I am now working on a 6 week program to increase my running ability and I love it.  This treadmill has been the thing that finally made me like to exercise, we love it and highly recommend it.

  We purchased this on SEP 27th and were supposed to have it delivered on OCT 4th. We also set up the in-home setup service, which I scheduled for October 5th. When 9 pm came around on OCT 4th and no sign of the treadmill, I called Amazon. The Rep was quite understanding, and after a few minutes on hold he got back on the line with me and said that our treadmill was lost in shipment. He proceeded to order us a replacement, which wouldn't arrive until OCT 16th. I rescheduled our in-home setup appointment for OCT 17th. The following Saturday I decided to call Amazon back as I was having trouble understanding how it could be lost in shipment. The Rep I spoke to was again, very courteous. She explained that she could put a tracer on the treadmill on Monday morning to try and find out more details. On Monday afternoon I received an email saying that they had found the treadmill and it was scheduled for delivery OCT 11th. I once again called in-home setup and re-scheduled my appointment to OCT 12th. On OCT 10th the in-home setup guy called and said he couldn't make it on the 12th and asked if I could reschedule my setup to the 15th of OCT. I said that wouldn't work for us and so he asked me to call him after it arrived, and he would see when he could fit me in.  The treadmill arrived today (OCT 11th), and I decided to tackle putting it together by myself. Well, me and my kitchen chair (see pictures). I tipped the delivery guy $10, and he helped me carry the (HEAVY) box to the room in my single-story home, where it was going. At a casual pace, the entire process took me an hour and a half. I used my DeWalt impact driver, a 3/16 and 7/32 hex drive bit, a Phillips bit (and screwdriver), a small adjustable wrench, and a utility knife. Putting it together wasn't terrible and the instructions are reasonably thorough. Be careful not to over tighten some of the small Phillips screws.  There were a few things I wasn't thrilled about.1. The packaging took some shipping damage, resulting in product damage, which I detailed in the attached photos.2. There was a random nylon locking nut laying loose in the box. I looked all over and could not find anywhere that it appeared to belong...3. When I tipped it on edge to unwrap it from the shipping plastic, I heard small plastic pieces rattle as they slid to the other side of the motor compartment. One small plastic piece fell out, and on examination, I found that the right side of the motor hood was not as secure as it should be. There's about 1/2' to 3/4'' of play where it really shouldn't be moving. I would guess that the brackets that hold the hood in place are plastic and I assume that is the piece that you can see in my photo. It doesn't seem to have an effect on functionality, but being a new unit, I would prefer no problems.  The unit powered up and works fine so far. If you have any questions, I'd be happy to try and answer them. I'm satisfied with the treadmill overall, it seems decent. I'll be sure to update if that changes. It wouldn't hurt for Amazon to comp me $100 for shipping damage. I will add that they did comp me $90 for the extreme shipping fiasco. I also apparently have a replacement treadmill still enroute... I guess I won't sign for it...

  Product page says:""Interactive Personal Training at Home powered by iFit; 1-year iFit membership included with your treadmill; gain access to on-demand, interactive trainer-led global and studio workout programs ($396 value)""This seems to be false. When I started the treadmill, it asked me to subscribe to iFit for 39$/month. So I contacted Amazon about my free membership, which routed me to NordicTrack. I contacted them, and they said it's not their problem, but iFit's. Finally I contact iFit. No response. I almost gave up when I stumbled upon this email address: amazon@ifit.zendesk.com - sent a request there and Monica was very nice to help me out activate my FREE membership.This seems like a case of misleading advertising.In any case, treadmill works fine, I'm happy with the iFit integration and the screen quality, it's just 3 stars because it was a nightmare to set up the iFit 1-year trial.

  I'm happy with the money I spent on this for the most part. The 6.5 Si is a solid treadmill that as a taller guy I feel very comfortable running on. The maximum speeds and inclines don't match the higher-end models, but for me the 10 mph speed and 10% incline are more than enough for my uses. Assembly took a couple hours, but was fairly straightforward. I initially had some trouble activating the 1-year iFit membership, which was frustrating given that was the reason I didn't go with the 6.5 S and decided to spend the extra money on the Si. I was eventually able to get it activated after getting in contact with iFit though. The iFit programs are pretty fun and the 10"" screen looks great, but the built-in speakers are not great and it was tough to find a balance that allowed me to hear both the music and the trainer clearly. Still, I do think the 1-year membership with the guided workouts add a lot of value over the 6.5 S and that's not even factoring in the 10"" screen.

  We have had this unit for less than two months.The first issue we experienced was the incline motor getting stuck in the up position. After a long wait to chat with customer service, I was asked to take a video of the issue and submit it. The whole process took about 90 minutes, and it was determined the incline motor was defective.We received the replacement motor about 5 days later. I installed it, and it worked for about 2 weeks. It got stuck again in the up position. I tested the original motor and found that I could retract it by hand, but when I installed it, it immediately went to the up position again.I contacted customer service again. This time it only took about 45 minutes before a CSR came online. I explained the issue, and told her I believe the computer was bad. Again, I had to submit a video. I also provided the number of my previous service ticket. It was determined that, this time, even though the symptoms were the same, it was the controller that needed replacement.We are presently waiting for the replacement to arrive. May update at that time.

    Difficult to move and can't get it into bedroom
  
",2.0,beejay4747,"Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2019","









  
  
    
  I walked on this for the first time today and would have given it a 5-star rating, except for the following:1)  I checked the measurements in the description as best I could, and it didn't seem that there was a lot of difference between the current one that I had and this one.  The console did seem larger, but there were no measurements given for it, and it is in fact, much larger than it looks in the pictures.  And so I cannot get the treadmill into my bedroom (standard 29 inch door) without taking it apart.  I didn't have it assembled in that room, because I was afraid I wouldn't get it back out.  I would think that NordicTrack would consider that the majority of people want to hide treadmills in bedrooms and would design them to fit through those doorways.  Now I have the option of having this large machine in the middle of my family room or my living room.2)  When you are looking at this on the website, they show a video of a young lady very easily moving the machine on its wheels.  The fact is that it is nearly impossible to accomplish this, unless you have some serious muscle.  You have to tip the machine so that it is resting only on the wheels, and in fact, the manual advises that it may take 2 people to do this.  It also advises you that the unit must not be moved using any other method.  So now, in addition to having a treadmill that I can't hide away in my bedroom, I can't even move it out of the way after I walk on it.3) A little bit of minor irritation.  When I got ready to walk on it for the first time, come to find out that I could not even start the machine until I signed up for the free trial of iFit, which included giving them a credit card number so that they could automatically charge me in 30 days for the program.  So now I am obligated to cancel it, which I most definitely will.  I should have had the option of being able to start the machine without signing up for the free trial.Bottom line is that I like the machine, but I don't know if I am going to send it back or not.  I don't want it in my living room or family room.  If anyone has any suggestions on how to get it through the bedroom doorway without taking it apart, I'd like to hear them.

  Delivery:  I received my Nordictrack T 6.5 S via local delivery truck the morning of Dec. 14, 2018.  The delivery guys called me 30 minutes prior to arrival to give me a heads-up on their arrival time.  They brought the treadmill down my driveway ramp through my basement level garage and into my basement.  They removed and disposed of the giant cardboard box and all the styrofoam.  What a great delivery service!  I paid an additional $19.99 to have the treadmill delivered to a room I specified.  This was totally worth the price.Then came assembly.  My techie roommate was able to assemble the treadmill in about 75 minutes.  There was a point when I provided an extra set of hands to help with something.  I canât remember what, but it was nothing major.  I see that Amazon is currently offering professional assembly for no added cost.  This is a pretty amazing offer that I would have been thrilled to have, especially had I not had the techie roommate that I have.  At the time I purchased the treadmill, the professional assembly cost was around $100.Performance:  I am so happy with the Nordictrack T 6.5 S treadmill!  I am able to walk and run to my heartâs content.  The belt runs smoothly and is not excessively loud.  The controls are great.  If I am running at 6.0 mph (I am short, so this is fast for me) and get tired, I can simply press the number 3 button on the right side of the panel, and the belt quickly slows to a speed where I can recover safely.  If I want to slowly speed up or down in decimal increments, there is an up/down button on the bottom of the panel.  There is also an up/down incline button to adjusts in .5 increments on the bottom left panel, or I can use the buttons on the left side of the panel to increase the grade in whole numbers.  I had been looking at purchasing the Nordictrack 1750, which is more of a commercial treadmill with a much steeper price.  I am so happy I did not purchase that more expensive treadmill!  I do not think it would have been worth the price difference.iFit: I am not using iFit, so I cannot comment on it.  I learned how to make YouTube playlists, so I am now watching the music videos, etc., that I want to watch.  Itâs a heck of a lot better than being subjected to whatever it is they have playing at the gym.

  Â I have been a fan of Nordic track for a long time... But this new nordictrack while being much more expensive than the powertrack 1500 I have been using for the longest time. Is incredible poorly made.If your looking for a treadmill that is sturdy, simple and quick to use, enjoyable to use, quiet, or doesn't have loads of huge and sharp seams all over it this isn't your machine.Pros:It works with a 300lb guy, and keeps up wellIts a decent footprint, definitely a little narrow.Folds up well... Or it would if the handles actually aligned with the frame, and didn't interfere with the folding feature... Actually that's more of a con...Cons:Very flimsyPoorly made(extremely low tolerance on every part)You will NEED to buy a proper tap and die kit to assemble this as nordictrack failed to tap several holes that the threaded bolts are to be installed into. More annoyingly the ones that they did tap where not tapped all the way through.(to tap a hole means to put threads into such that a bolt or nut can thread or be screwed into)You will need a (3/8"" coarse 16 tap with a long shaft)It takes a couple of minutes from the time you turn it on and get on it before it boots up and actually let's you use it.Its got a touchscreen... One smaller than your phone. 7"" so unless you have 20:20 vision or glasses on, theirs no using the interface at all... It also loves to pop up ads, and constantly wants your information and wifi access. No just hopping on and enjoying a workout anymore.The fan you see in the picture, it's not real, just a fake grill, which behind it isactually a 3"" wide cage fan(sometime found in very cheap car accessories or electrical boxs) it's hyper loud, but manages to push a usable amount of air.And that's coming from a user that has the treadmill in a server room...Overall I'll probably have to keep it since it's a oversized thing to have shipped of picked up by Amazon, and I throughout my back getting it inside.

  Wow!  Beautiful treadmill.It would be really nice if I could actually use it.Be aware when you buy one of these, you will be forced to register it on-line before it will operate.  Apparently you have to purchase a ""free"" 30 day trial iFit membership.  Of course it's only free after you give them your credit card information and purchase a subscription for more than $100 per month, after which you can cancel.  If you don't forget.  And maybe they will actually cancel it before the 30 days is up.  Or they may not.  Who knows?In the meantime, it takes them an hour to process your registration, before they can even help you.  THEN you get to wade through their labyrinthine phone mail system to get to the right help line whereupon you get placed on hold until their phone mail system hangs up on you for no reason.  Then you get to repeat the whole process several times, provided you have two to three hours to spend waiting on the hold for them to get to you.  If not, come back again another day when you have more time and try it all again.  This is called ""Customer Service.""Pros:  Beautiful Treadmill.  Looks lovely.  Has awesome reviews from people who apparently have been able to get it to work.  Meanwhile it makes a great coat rack and place to store stuff.  How well does it work?  Personally, I haven't the foggiest.  Because until I can get someone to give me some kind of access code or something I can't get past the stupid welcome screen that tells me I have to register the product.  Which I've done.  Several times.  Several different ways.  And still have no idea how to get past that stupid welcome screen.Cons:  Have I mentioned the stupid welcome screen.  Why can't I just plug it in and start running?One Star each for for appearance, speed of delivery, ease of delivery and ease of set up.Minus two stars for difficulty registering the product, and for the sheer stupidity of forcing your customer to buy a product they don't want just to get the thing to work in the first place.

  Going to be very blunt about this machine.

Thereâs a tab on the top right where it says manual workout and youâre able to get straight into your workout. I didnât need to sign up for ANYTHING OR PAY FOR THEIR MEMBERSHIP.

    Great Product for Working out (but with a couple of annoyances)
  
",4.0,Married and happy,"Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  I purchased this product primarily for walking when the weather doesn't cooperate  (five months of snow on the ground).  The treadmill itself is excellent.  I did have a couple of issues that were annoying.  One is the requirement to register the product and sign up for a fitness program, IFit, using a credit card.  I refused to do that and was prepared to return the treadmill until I saw another review where the author explained how to by-pass the registration process by pressing the iFit button for 30 seconds.  [The review from ""Amazon Customer"" stated, ""TO GET AROUND THIS SCAM, hold down the iFit logo on the treadmill for 30 seconds and your treadmill will work. I hope this helps people from being forced to give out their credit card and personal information.""]  Thank you Amazon Customer!  The second annoyance was an ""undocumented feature"" [at least I didn't see it in the manual].  The third time I used the treadmill, I put the red key on the console and I heard a motor running but the tread wasn't moving and when I pressed any of the buttons they just beeped.  Nothing appeared to be happening so I removed the red key and tried several times more.  Thinking that there must be some simple reason for it not working, I messaged the Nordic Track help desk describing my problem.  They next day I received a reply from a nice lady who told me that the treadmill was behaving normally.  It was calibrating the incline.  I should put the red key on the console and let it complete the calibration process.  The tread inclined all the way to the top and then all the way to the bottom.  After it was finished doing its thing the treadmill worked like it should.  [I'm not sure why it waited until its third use to do this.  Perhaps it was because I raised the platform to the store position overnight and then set it back down the following morning.  I haven't done it again, so I'm not sure that was what caused it.  I call the calibration process an ""undocumented feature"".  But, I may have just missed reading it in the manual.]  Would I purchase this product again.  Definately YES.  It is a well build product and is easy to use, once I got past the two annoyances I mentioned above.  If it weren't for them, I would have scored this product a solid five.

  Just had the treadmill delivered today. It is very heavy as expected. Assembly wasnât difficult, but having two people makes it easier. Once the unit was set up and turned on the screen was stuck at âactivate with ifitâ. The machine does not need activation via ifit to work. Just hold down the ifit sync button for 15 seconds to bypass. That is not listed anywhere in the book. Once that was done, I activated the manual mode and increased the speed. The belt is making a horrible clicking noise. Searches online confirm it is a bad motor. I tried to do an amazon return but they require the unit to be disassembled and weâre no help. It took forever to get through to nordictrack customer service. Make sure you register your device online before you call or you wonât be able to get through. Once I did that. I was on hold for thirty minutes before I realized they had already closed. Even though the phone system let me on hold. I will try again Monday to get a replacement motor but will never buy this brand again!

I had to pass my previous equipment to my daughter. I need to do rehab from my home, so I do not want to cheat myself on quality! I selected this NordiTrack and I am so impressed with it! It came with a 30 day free trial of IFit An interactive workout with instructors, better than Peloton, but I have no chance of ever keeping up with them, So I do not utilize it, but I did enjoy the world tour!! I see people have made comments about it, but they obviously did not read the instructions!! ( no credit card info is required, and they send an email at the end of the 30 days if you want to purchase it monthly) I photographed the ledge where I store my IPad, because it is wide enough, I do not have to remove the keyboard! BONUS! And the âcup holderâ is way larger than others. Feel free to place your 1/2 gallon water bottle ð.  (Someone really thought this out). Look at the large operation area! It looks like it belongs in a Commercial gym, yet it fits perfectly in my small gym, which is the size of my smallest bedroom. I can not go outside to walk, so this is a life saver for me. I treated myself without emptying my bank account. The shock absorbers under the platform are easy on my sore legs and the rails are long enough that I do not have to purchase separate medical safety rails! (They did not miss a thing on this model). The more expensive models are great too, with huge screens, but with the space for the iPad, I can still enjoy the large screen without the large price! My therapy room is complete and I am on my way to a healthier body!

  Took less time to assemble than it did to unpackage! Easy lift and lowers with an automatic shock. I read previous comments and learned you can skip the ifit registration by simply holding down the ifit (blue) button for about 30 seconds- then you donât have to pay to subscribe and it works like a regular treadmill. Iâd suggest to watch for a good price bcz they seem to list the same product with different prices occasionally. The week before I ordered it was 599, when I ordered it was 679. So far I love it and itâs not holding any clothing yet!

  This is a heavy-duty machine. You can not set this up by yourself; it definitely needs two people.  The speakers are decent.  Since this is for home use they are loud enough. If you want something a little louder then you have to connect another speaker with the aux cable in order to amplify the sound.  I have used this machine every day for over an hour.  It runs quietly.  My only complaint is that it makes a popping noise when you first increase your incline.  I am going to ask Norditrac about that sound.  It folds at an angle so it still takes up space. The machine is heavy so use two hands to lift it when folding.  When opening it, the machine will take over halfway and descend slowly so you don't have to bend or fear dropping it.  I walk, jog, run and climb on this machine and I feel great afterwards

  I've owned this machine for 6 months and could not be more pleased with it.  It performs flawlessly and does everything you could ask of a treadmill.  I especially love the smooth automatic incline that gives me the ""hill"" resistance I need to train.  I'm 5' 10"" and 180 lbs, and the sturdiness and deck length are perfect for me.  I would guess the machine would be well suited for anyone up to 200 lbs and 5' 11"" but beyond that a larger heavier machine might be needed.  Folds up easily for storage between workouts. Assembly requires two people, or if you've assembled treadmills before (as I have) you can manage it alone.  As to VALUE....it's worth way more than the asking price!  Get it.

  Please listen closely to this review. I just recently purchased this treadmill. All the reviews you read about how difficult it is to put together is not accurate. If you are just the least bit handy you can set it up no problem. It took me about an hour and a half to get it setup and running once I got it out of the box.  The only reviews that are accurate are the ones that mention the IFIt subscription. They state you must login to activate the machine then you are asked to pay $15 a month. This is true however all you need to do once the treadmill is setup is turn it on and hold down the ifit button for 20 to 30 seconds and it will immediately activate. Shame on Nordic track for that however from scam perspective I bet they have a great legal team that could argue to that point. Now to speak to the treadmill itself it works perfect, very sturdy canât even hear the belt or motor while using.

  You can bypass ifit and activate the treadmill by holding down the ifit button for about 30 seconds.It is such a scam to imply that a membership for ifit is required to activate the treadmill. I started to register for ifit, then stopped immediately when it asked for my credit card info. We were able to successfully activate by holding down the button.

    Perfect if what you want is a treadmill

  The Mrs. and I were wanting ""just a treadmill"".  We didn't want, nor need the wifi enabled, networked, ifit instructors on the screen yelling at you to run faster, 1080p 64"" TV screen so you can watch your movies while running ""running experience"" . . . . we just wanted a solid treadmill that we can get on for 20 minutes a day and get a workout on.  And this is the PERFECT machine for what we were looking for.It's solid, so don't expect a 1 person lift . . . . this thing is heavy, and you'll need a dolley to move it around to where you want it in the house.  It's also not super easy to assemble.  It took my teenage son and I about 2 hours to get it all unpacked, assembled, and remove all the packing boxes and material.  There are several pieces that you really should assemble with 2 people . . . one person holding the part/s and the other one screwing bolts together.  Now, that being said, the assembly was not complicated, and the instructions were easy to understand and follow.  I would just strongly recommend that you move it around and assemble with 2 people.And so far, this machine is working awesome, and is used just about every day.  It's also very intuitive to get it going.1) turn on the power2) step on the treadmill3) push the big green ""start"" button4) push the big ""+"" or ""-"" buttons until you get it to the speed you like5) push the big ""<"" or "">"" buttons to incline to the ramp to the slope you want6)  enjoy until you want to stop, and then you just hit the big red ""stop"" button.That's it . . . too easy.Now, it does have programmable settings, and a heart rate monitor, etc. etc. etc. . . . but we've not even looked at those.  The Mrs. gets on and puts the speed to 3.5 at slope 1, and goes for 12-15 minutes.  I get on and put the speed at 5.0 at slope 1.5 and go 20 minutes; and we're both happy.Would highly recommend this product.OH, and FYI . . . if you want to turn it on without having to register with IFIT online . . . just hold the little blue ifit button that's just below the LED screen for 30 seconds . . . and you can bypass all the online registration for ifit.  That's one we had to figure out the hard way.  We had to register online for an ifit subscription for them to tell us that all we have to do it hold the button for 30 seconds to not have to register.  of course, they tell you that after you register.

    Stay Away From This Treadmill!
  
",1.0,Craig L,"Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2021","









  
  
    
  Ok, so, I've had this treadmill for 8 months now and I feel like I can give it a thorough and fair review.  Let me preface this review by saying this treadmill gets used 3-4 times per week, used by in shape and not overweight people and used typically below its speed and incline maximums.  For comparison, my previous treadmill was one that purchased from Sears and used in the same manner for almost 20 years with NO issues at all.  Now for the reasons for my 1-star rating.  After only 3 months of use, the treadmill stopped working, the belt would not start.  I contacted NordicTrack customer service and it was determined that the control module was bad.  They sent a new control module for me to replace, but I was left with no treadmill for 3 weeks while waiting for the part.  Fast forward to just 2 days ago.  While running at a moderate pace at an incline of 1%, I heard a loud crack and realized the entire board that the belt runs around was cracked lengthwise right down the middle for the entire length of the board.  I am about 190lbs and this treadmill is rated for 300lbs, so please know weight was not the issue.  I reached out to NordicTrack customer service today and now I'm waiting for board to be shipped to me, which is currently out of stock.  This will have me down for at least another 3 weeks.  I purchased this treadmill based on the rating and, what I thought to be, a reputable brand.  I couldn't have been any more mistaken.  If youâre going to drop some money on a treadmill, don't choose this one.  If you need to, spend some extra $ and get a treadmill with actual reliability.  If your treadmill is going to become a clothes rack, then go ahead and get this tread, as it will function quite well and reliably for that function.I need to add a short bit about assembly of this treadmill.  I am very mechanically inclined, I do most of my own home repairs and I assemble everything I purchase.  This treadmill was poorly constructed and some of the parts did not fit and align properly, which made the assembly difficult and frustrating.  Some parts of the assembly instructions were vague as well.One last thing, once fully assembled, you will not move this through interior doorways without removing the door from its hinges.  Even after removing the door, it's a tight squeeze that I wouldn't recommend.  Most likely it will require some minor disassembly in order to move through a doorway with ease.I hope this review helps you in making your purchase decision.

",1.0,Miranda Jae,"Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I just want to start by saying I had researched treadmills for quite a few months before purchasing this. The price was great. Not too fancy but not too basic. That's pretty much where it ends.Upon arrival, the metal frame in the front of the treadmill at the base showed up damaged.  I tried calling. I tried chatting. I tried emailing. Getting the run around over and over and over again! They wont even acknowledge the fact that it's damaged. I am beyond frustrated with their customer service.The free year of iFit set up was not in my package, that I can see. I tried contacting them about that an assured me it is and to look again. (I dont see it here)The treadmill has been powered on in the past months to set up my account. I went to further look at the iFit stuff on the actual treadmill to see what's free and what isn't. It wasnt loading anything so I turned the whole thing off. Now it wont turn on at all! (I do not have it in a GFI outlet and yes the outlet works, nothing has been tripped.)So not only do I have a damaged treadmill that they refuse to talk to me about, and a free year of ifit that doesnt seem to exist. The thing now just doesnt work.So I guess, buy at your own risk.

  This treadmill performs well. For my purposes, it is perfect. The uphill function isnât that great, but it will give a slight incline. The machine is rather loud, so I have to use headphones when I want to watch or listen to anything. Moving it around is a little challenging but I like that it is foldable so it doesnât take up too much room. I took a star off because the machine was cracked during delivery and they try to trick you into buying a membership to use the machine. There is a very small selection that allows you to bypass the membership to start the machine.

    Broken Machine on Day 1; Pathetic Customer Service
  
",1.0,Martin Brody,"Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2021","









  
  
    
  This looks like it could be a nice treadmill, especially if you enjoy the iFit app and video workouts.  Unfortunately, my machine arrived defective out of the box.  Despite being properly grounded, it shocked me any time touched.  Not a humidity issue. Not a sneaker issue. Just a faulty machine.  Unfortunately, it looks like faulty machines are common with NordicTrack (perhaps that is why they have discontinued this model...think about that before buying it).  Even worse, customer service is non-existent.  Extended warranty...doesn't matter.Service is slow and difficult to work with.  In my case, they decided to send a new cable, despite explaining to them that I had checked the grounding.  So, I had to wait two weeks for a cable to arrive, knowing it wouldn't work.  Not surprisingly, the issue wasn't resolved, so I called them to have a technician come.  Apparently, they forgot to arrange a technician.  I called two weeks later for an update and was promised a call within 24 hours.  5 days later, still nothing.  I finally received a technician's call 4 weeks later.  When they arrived, it was clear they wouldn't be helpful....they said they were only there to reattach the cable (and not actually diagnose the problem).  They ripped the mat under my treadmill.  And they not only left three screws out of their holes, but also left a loose screw in the motor box!  I realized it because every time I lifted the treadmill up and down, I could hear it fall.  So I opened up the motor box and there it was....lucky it didn't blow out the motor.Despite explaining all of this to customer service weeks ago, I haven't even received the courtesy of a response or a simple apology (never mind getting someone here to fix the original issue).  I'll be returning the treadmill and look forward to the new Sole F80 I just ordered.

    Good value, nice belt width and length.
  
",5.0,Ray A.,"Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  So for a 2.6HP treadmill with this belt size, the price was right.Delivery: I opted to pay $20 extra for 'in room of choice' delivery.  Without a helper this thing would have been impossible for me to bring in the house.  It is quite large box (7ft long?  2.5ft wide?) and quite heavy (200lbs?)  So $20 well spent.  Two people came and delivered it.  They scheduled with me 48 hours in advance, it was a 4 hour window of delivery.  I just needed to be home and point where I wanted them to leave the box.Assembly: I see a lot of complaints about assembly.  I would say it is about as difficult as similar fitness equipment.  You will need a few hand tools: screw driver (phillips), 14mm wrench (an SAE size also seemed to fit, but 14mm fit better), it comes with an allen/hex key.  An electronic screwdriver or drill with hex key bit and phillips bit will make things easier - but be very careful not to overtighten small screws that go through plastic fittings.  Assembly likely took me about 2 hours?  A helper will make things much easier - though I did it by myself I wouldn't recommend it - there were a couple of times the book said get a helper and I didn't and it occurred to me that if I slipped or lost grip it was going to hurt really badly if something came crashing down that I was holding in place while I used my other hand to turn a screw or bolt.  Basically I'll say this - if you don't think you could assemble a kid's bicycle, then pay for someone else to assemble it.  If you don't have screwdrivers or wrenches, pay for someone else to assemble it.  If you don't have a helper, pay for someone else to assemble it.  I'm really lucky I didn't slip and hit my head or crush my hand when I was too impatient to wait for a helper to come home from work :)Functionality - as has been reported in other reviews, you turn it on and it says it won't do anything until you activate it only.  Activation basically signs you up for an account.  I didn't bother.  I'm never going to use the ifit function and I don't want to give my info to one more company that doesn't need it.If you turn power on, then hold down ifit button for 30 seconds - it will skip the activation process.  I read this from another reviewer, and it worked.Other than that - features are as described.  It's a treadmill.  It's not any more quiet or loud than any other residential treadmill I've seen.  I'm sure that in a year I'll need to adjust the belt, and lubricate it.  That's pretty typical.

  This treadmill is absolutely amazing!! Fits perfectly and nicely in my bedroom! I was able to assemble it in about two hours. Two people would def help but honestly nothing a secure chair and a little manipulation canât help. You will need help to get the base where you want it, but once in place you can put it together solo ðð»Sound: very quiet for a treadmill. I am able to workout at night and share a wall with other tenants and no complaints or issues. Some people say it squeaks, it should not, mine does not at all.Run: this thing works like a charm. Iâve only had this a week and logged over 25 miles and been able to use this machine twice a day some days without any problem.Con: the factory defect that those speak of on here is true. The controls are missing buttons, but honestly for the price Iâm not completely worried about it.ifit: you donât have to register for it before starting machine, just turn on and hold ifit for 30secs to bypass and youâre all good. Also you can still sign up and use your 1 year ifit after you have done this.

  The assembly was a little more than expected on this machine, but doable. I downloaded the ifit app and did some of the workouts which i enjoyed, but not enough to pay monthly. I decided to just jump on and do a manual workout without the app and quickly realized there is no way to pause the machine if you are interumpted during your workout (kids, bathroom break, etc) I contacted the company and they said unless you pay for the monthly membership there is not a pause option...so I have to pay to pause my workout which is a basic feature on treadmills....and this one is supposed to be smart...well I don't agree!! I would not recommend this product unless you plan to pay for the membership, and even still you have to connect to the app to have the pause option...still rediculous

  Without my gym and pilates studio during this pandemic I have gained quite a few pounds. This treadmill was the best purchase I could have made to help shed those extra pounds. As you can see from the picture, I mounted a little television and fan on the wall in front of the treadmill. I love to come home from work and immediately put on my workout clothes and spend an hour on my treadmill running or doing hills. I just zone out to something on Netflix, and if it's a really good show, I'll stay on for 90 minutes or more. I love that you can adjust the shock absorption, great for my joints when I'm running. The only downside is you can't program your information into the treadmill itself, you have to subscribe to iFit at $15 a month. I am taking advantage of the one free month, but the only feature I use is putting in my own workout, I don't care to use the workouts they offer, they really aren't that great.

  I recently purchased this treadmill, in hopes of getting back in shape.  Let me begin with it was not an easy treadmill to put together, it took my husband and I over an hour and a half to get it up and running.  For the first 4 days that I used it, I loved it. I was even able to use it without the ifit option, by holding down the ifit button for 10 seconds and it opened so i could use it manually.  So, on my 5th day of using the treadmill, I go to turn on the switch and the motor is running but the treadmill will not start. I, unplugged it several times, turned the reset switch off and on and still nothing.  I have a call into NordicTrack for support.  Will see how it goes.  I will update once I get an answer.Wednesday January 27, 2021, I had the treadmill pickup and returned to Amazon today.  After talking to several people with NordicTrack and Amazon, I was advised to return the item.  NordicTrack is a good brand, but I guess you could still find lemons there too.  Good luck to you all, I hope you are able to find what your looking for.

  It's been nine years since I went for a run. That length of time shocked me. I used to run a couple times a week. I kept giving myself the excuse of not running because it was always too hot or too cold outside. I never went to the gym because it cost too much and the added 20-30 min. roundtrip each day adds up.I gave in and in a moment of mania bought the best treadmill I could afford. Paying $20-$30 for me and my spouse to use a gym to run, means that this treadmill will pay itself off in 2-3 years. We've been using it for two months now. It gets daily use.I've managed to eliminate the excuse of too hot or too cold by having a home treadmill. I've eliminated the excuse of not going to the gym because it's too far and is too much added time. I've had my cardiovascular health improve by leaps and bounds over the last to months by just jogging for 30 mins. or by running intervals for 20-30 mins.It's a habit that needs to be developed. It's a commitment that needs perseverance. But it's a commitment and habit that is worth it beyond measure, especially for someone like me that works mostly behind a desk at a mostly sedentary job.The  treadmill has two cushions on either side. The cushions reduce the impact and wear and tear on your joints. The controls are easy to use. You can pay an additional $15/month to use iFit, and must create an account in order to first set up your treadmill (which is stupid). The app is cool and pairs nicely with a treadmill especially using the iPad. In the end, not needing or wanting the app, it's just annoying that you have to set up an account to use the treadmill.I'm 5'11"" and have a decently long stride. My wife is 5'9"" and fits perfectly on the tread. I, however, could have used the additional 5"", but paying another $300 for a 60"" tread length was out of my budget. I don't use the Aux in jack or the built in speakers. They sound much worse than a decent pair of headphones and it's a bummer that the BT connection doesn't work with music.The heart rate monitor is incredibly inaccurate, but a fitbit or apple watch is just what you need. There's a big discrepancy between the mileage of the treadmill and my apple watch (which is more accurate).Overall it serves a purpose, namely allowing me to run in my home. I use it for that. I use the incline. I use the speed controls. I don't use all the other features. The cushions are wonderful it would be great to have both more cushioning and a longer tread length, but in the end, all the added cost and unused features weren't worth it for me. This was a worthwhile investment for me and I'm glad to have made the lifestyle change. I can't wait to see where I am in a year.

  Two stars due to setup instructions that pressure you to provide credit card information to use the treadmill.To expand on this, once you set up the treadmill, there is a sticker that reads ""Your smart treadmill is currently locked. It will not start until you go ifit.com/activate."" When you visit that site, it will ask you to enable cookies. When you decline, it breaks cookies into four categories, one of which is ""essential"". Once you make it through to the site, it looks like a marketing landing page! To create an account, they try and get you to enter your full name and credit card information. The model we purchased does not even have an HD screen, so we do not want an iFit account and certainly do not want to share our personal information.To bypass this, do two things. First, make sure that the red emergency key is engaged on the treadmill. Second, hold down the iFit button for 15-30 seconds. This will allow the treadmill to function.In short, the printed instructions regarding iFit are simply false. This is terrible customer service and a potential legal liability for NordicTrack. I hope that they will value customer experience over subscription revenues in the future.

  So far so good, machine has been in house for a week of steady use between my wife and myself,I did not pay for the ""free"" installation service, and although it would have saved time, i was able to put it together myself.PRO TIP: one of the last steps is to put the adjustment bar underneath the frame so that you can lock the machine up in place when not in use, do this BEFORE you put on the legs when you can flip the base on its side, this was a pain in the rear attempting to one arm hold the machine up and then unscrew and place that pole in place.I hope this helps! -Mr.J

  At the beginning of the Covid-19 crisis, I decided to purchase the NordicTrack.  We comparison shopped and selected NordicTrack based on price, features and company reputation.  We anticipated our local athletic facility would close and did not want our cardio health to suffer.Given the ongoing pandemic crisis, I am so glad this was purchased!OBSERVATIONSIt is width is greater than a standard doorway!  You'll need to assemble where you want to use it. OR have an extra wide doorway. I moved mine and had to remove the monitor.Place 1 inch padding underneath unless you place it on concrete.Reasonably easy to move...  2 wheels on baseIt is heavy and requires 1 person to relocate (200lbs+)... if moving in narrow spaces.... 2 people.Power cord is not long enough. A nice extension cord works or circuit protected outlet strip would work nicely.Installation is fairly easy, just follow the directions - no freelancing.Packaged nicely and parts are marked.This model has a small screen with character graphics.... really Nordic this is 2020.  10in ""real"" screen drives price to $1k and for me that defeats the purpose of a backup while we wait for Covid-19 to pass.Be careful the tread bed seems shorter than a commercial model... so beware and adjust accordingly.It's Made in China!  However fit, form and function is good.  Again nicely packaged. We'll see how long this lasts.So far we are very happy with it.PROSPrice - Overall performanceFeel of the beltGeneral features are great (Note: this is not a commercial product)It feels substantial not inexpensiveIn closing, this product fits our needs - nicely and at a reasonable price.Recommend it for home use.

  For the cost, I expected far more âadvanced technologyâ. Seems like this mightâve been made in the early 90s?.. Just an aux connection?Not a pile of dodo by any means though, itâs actually easy to assemble and somewhat durable. BUT - the cost is far too high because you WILL NEVER get your ROI here. Joining a gym would be a better idea.Important to note - this treadmill comes with a few documents asking you to âactivate the treadmillâ by going to some IFIT website. IN MY OPINION thats borderline âfalse advertisingâ because it could not be further from the truth. Simply hold the iFit blue button for 30 seconds and you bypass it, no problem.

    A tale of Amazon woe
  
",1.0,Stephanie M.,"Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  I wish I could comment more on the treadmill itself, but instead I am still dealing with the nightmare that has been getting it. This is the first time I've gone so far as to write a negative review, I am not usually a ""Karen"" about things, but it has been that awful. Amazon gives no other recourse for such feedback that I was able to find, so here we are.Chapter One - Monday: The original treadmill showed up from Priority Express looking like it came through a wood chipper, so I wasn't surprised to find it broken once unpackaged. The return process sounded easy enough; a new one could get here quickly, but it would take two weeks for the broken to get retrieved. I do not have room for two, so I waited the two weeks to have a pick-up/drop-off scheduled on the same day. They were kind enough to offer an unsolicited $20 credit for the inconvenience, which I thought was nice, since nothing too bad had happened yet.Chapter Two - Monday: The new one arrives as promised via Priority Express, but they ""have no paperwork"" for picking up the old. I'm informed it must be a different third party doing that piece later in the day. By 4pm I am calling Amazon and asking for an update, and I'm told they're not sure what happened with the return piece, but the soonest they could have it retrieved would be four days following. Fine. I ask for a confirmation email this time, since this was my second attempt. I received an email from Pilot with a scheduled pick-up time/date and confirmation number. Great.Chapter Three - Thursday: No one from Pilot shows up, though my tracking # says someone is out to pick it up as of noon. I call their number and I'm told no one was in my area today, and the soonest they can come is the following Monday. I inform them this is the second time I've had to arrange my schedule around this pick-up that keeps not happening, so is there a way to confirm this will happen. Internally, Iâm lamenting this stupid treadmill is still taking up a ridiculous amount of space in my small house. Amazon doesn't even show that I'm still owing them this return, it's clearly been lost in the ether at this point, but I still don't feel right not getting it back to them somehow. I'm told by the gentleman that if I leave it outside with a note, then I don't need to be home. Awesome.Chapter Four â Present Day: Itâs now 3pm and I'm about to cry. So, I call Pilot again. After 15 minutes on hold, I'm told it is scheduled for pick-up today and they will call me. I confirm it's still OK I'm not home for the pick-up, as the treadmill is now sitting in front of the house with a note. I'm told no, someone needs to sign for it. I explain the last person told me that was not the case and could they please be informed of their misunderstanding so other customers are not being confused. To this, I'm told there is no record of me speaking to anyone before, so they don't know where I got that information. But I need to sign for it. Iâm now speechless and beginning to question my sanity.Epilogue: Amazon, I really am trying to get this monstrosity of exercise equipment back to you. But at this point, if the thing isn't off my front lawn by the time I finish work tonight I will likely go Office Space on it.Acknowledgements: If you made it this far, thank you for reading my tale of Amazon woe. To my husband, thank you for your unwavering support during this trying experience. And finally, to my brother-in-law, thank you for helping us get the stupid beast of a thing outside. We literally couldn't have done it without you.

    Great hardware, poor experience with activation requirement
  
",1.0,Sauron@Mordor,"Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased this treadmill because I wanted to exercise indoors.  The hardware itself seems sturdy and it only took me about 30 mins to put everything together.  That's when I discovered that you cannot actually use the machine unless you ""activate"" it with ifit.com.  This involves you setting up an account, downloading their app, and giving your personal information and credit card info.  Then the app pairs with the treadmill and you can use it.  I find this to be deceptive.  Had this ""requirement"" been clearly stated on the marketing info, I'd have purchased another product.  After the treadmill was activated, I promptly cancelled my ""subscription"" that I didn't want in the first place.  It's too bad because the actual hardware seems pretty nice and I've enjoyed using it so far.Edit:  I noticed after the purchase that it's possible (though not documented in the materials shipped with the unit) that it is possible to activate the treadmill without forking over your credit card info and personal data.  Pity I only saw that after the fact.  It's the review with the most helpful ""likes"".  Read that before purchasing.

  Warning, treadmill box delivered is 200lbs.  Couldn't lift it myself, had to slide the box into the house, but box wouldn't fit through the door.  Took treadmill out and slid it on a rug into the room.  Assembly instructions were really straightforward.  Took me a couple hours.  Also, the threads on the 1 silver ground screw were defective, so it wouldn't screw in.  This screw is important because it grounds the machine to prevent electric shock.  Replacement screw is .99 cents plus shipping.  Amazon support credited me for the replacement screw.  Will update this review again once I receive the replacement screw. Edit- never received the replacement screw. Bought one from local hardware store.

    Speed calibration is way off, iFit app is terrible
  
",1.0,G. Prioreschi,"Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  First, the speed calibration is way off. I set it for 6.0 MPH (10:00 miles) and timed the belt, it was running 6.6 MPH (9:06). If you're a runner at all, you know that's a HUGE difference.Also, the iFit app is terrible:- The app takes over your phone's screen for your entire workout. I use my phone to play music when I work out. Want to skip a song? Nope, can't do that, the iFit app has taken over the screen. Read the text I just got to see if it's an important work text? Nope, can't do that. So not only does it require your phone in order to work out, but it turns your phone into a useless brick for the duration of the workout.- When I start the treadmill it gives me a 3 minute warmup before the ""workout"" starts. But I warm up before I get on the treadmill, always have. Nope, can't do that, you're gonna do our warmup. Which would be fine, I'd ignore the warmup and just set the speed to my workout pace, except that it resets the time and distance indications at the end of the 3 minute ""warmup"".- This would be terrible enough if the whole app wasn't a blatant attempt to get me to pay $15/month for the privilege of using the treadmill I just paid $700 for. I did read the fine print that the credit card number was optional, so I didn't enter it. Does that mean my treadmill will stop working when the 30-day ""free trial"" is over? Since Amazon's return policy is also 30 days, I don't intend to keep it long enough to find out.Based on comments in the reviews, i tried holding the ""IFit sync"" button down for 30 seconds to bypass the app. Yeah, that worked. As long as you don't let the treadmill sit for a few minutes -- it then resets back to needing the app, and pushing the button doesn't work any more, you need to switch the treadmill off and back on again and then hold the button down for 30 seconds.I regret buying this treadmill. It might just be usable: I could adjust my speed setting based on measuring the belt speed, and I could hit the sync button for 30 seconds every time I want to use it... but that would require me to trust that the thing will continue to work once the 30 day free trial / Amazon return window has expired. Let me get this straight: you want me to bet $700 that that this thing won't hold me for $15/month ransom when the whole experience has already been skeezy as heck? Yeah, sure, I totally trust you guys.Plus, frankly, I'm pissed off. I paid twice as much for this treadmill as the $350 entry level model I had previously, and what I got was badly calibrated equipment, a terrible app, and a blatant grab for more of my cash. At least the entry level model was honest about what it was.

  Once upon a time, I was an All-American track athlete. But alas, age, life and children have caught up with me. Enter my new mechanized running apparatus. I bought it for the sole purpose of losing weight; itâs working.The rundown.Itâs a treadmill, and does what a treadmill is designed to do; relentlessly circulate a belt at variable speeds helping the user lose weight and get in shape.Look, itâs not hard to put together if you or someone you know has any inkling of mechanical knowledge, and if you can read and follow basic directions for assembly, then youâre golden. If not, pay someone who is to do it for you. Iâd wager Itâll take most people 1-2 hours to assemble; make sure you have help, itâs a two person job.The iFit is a joke for the price. Bypass this feature by installing the red, magnetic kill switch thingy...then simply hold down the blue iFit logo for 15-30 seconds. Boom, done. You can now use your treadmill without paying a kingâs ransom for a gimmick that is in all honesty, not worth the price.This is perfect for what I need it for. 45 minutes a day, 5 days a week. And a great coat rack in between.

    Very happy overall
  
",5.0,EDS,"Reviewed in the United States November 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  Overall, I am really happy with this purchase. I waited to write the review until I had enough time using it..First, the bad-- it was NOT easy to put together. It took me and my daughter about 5 hours and countless expletives to assemble. I almost have up at least twice, and I still can't bring myself to finish installing the fold up bar thing. (We just leave it open because we don't need the space, but TBH it doesn't look like it would help much to fold it anyway). I'm not an expert at anything mechanical, but I have never encountered a piece of furniture or household repair that has been as frustrating and difficult as this. If I had to do over, I would've paid extra for assembly.Now the good--this is a very high quality treadmill. It's not something you would see at the gym, but I am really impressed by how well made and sturdy it is. It also has a lot of shock absorbtion, which was one of the things I really looked for. I have trouble with knees/hips from years of (over)training. The combo of this treadmill and my Hoka Bondis or Saucony Endorphin shifts is perfect--no pain.Another plus-- i was wary of the iFit thing after reading some reviews that said it was a rip-off and basically ruins the utility of the treadmill if you don't pay. However, the account is free and you don't have to give them any credit card info to automatically charge when the trial runs out. I might actually pay for it, which as a serious cheapskate, I never thought I'd do. I have really enjoyed the workouts. You watch a video with a trainer running in awesome, exotic locations and the treadmill automatically adjusts incline and speed to match what you see. As someone who needs to be pushed (I lack the ability to voluntarily move out of ""light exertion""), my workouts are waaaay more challenging and productive when I'm following an iFit trainer. I haven't actually tried using the treadmill without it, but my daughter runs intervals on ""manual"" all the time with no issue. She says it's like a regular treadmill that way.Bottom line--if you have already spent a ridiculous amount of time researching every possible option (it took me 3 months to decide), you know that this one pops up on most of the ""best"" lists. Rightfully so. If you can get it for under $1k, go for it.

    Great product but TERRIBLE DELIVERY EXPERIENCE
  
",5.0,KSaxena,"Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is my best purchase since covid . Totally worth the moneyHowever to be honest the shipping was quite a hassle . I have heard similar issues with everyone that has ordered this item.The final mile delivery in may city is done through one provider , and all of my friends have faced the same issue with their treadmill delivery - they donât communicate and are NOT on time .I had taken a day off to accept the delivery and assemble it , however the treadmill Did NOT arrive. I had to go through many amazon customer service calls to finally get a status of my shipment , and it didnât arrive till a week later .Once it arrived it was a task to fit it inside my home . The box is 300lbs and the delivery is doorstep only. NO IN-HOME DELIVERY.Once unpacked I noticed the treadmill shipment was damaged - delaying my installation process . The damaged parts were replaced free of cost but they took 4 weeks to arrive . So overall I was only able to use my treadmill 6 weeks After I got it ! It was just lying around occupying space for that long !!!The treadmill does require two to assemble, and while the assembly can take time its not impossible for novice handymen.You do need to follow the steps precisely and I had to watch the YouTube video numerous times to capture the detailsBut once assembled the product is great .The screen is great and the user experience is seamless too.I skipped signing up for the IFIT membership but I will do so at some point to utilize my free year .The one thing I do want - is video streaming on the screen. Youâd think that a 14 inch screen would allow streaming Netflix, but it does not . I hope this is something they introduce with a firmware update in future .In the meantime I use the google maps feature a lot.I would recommend the product, but please be aware of the hassle that comes with  shipping and installation ! I wish a company like AMAZON would have the best supply chain / shipment network .But clearly this is not the case with their NordicTrack shipments

  Treadmill arrived damaged. It's bad enough that you have to set it up yourself following their very poorly written instructions but then it arrives broken.Will update when I've finished putting it together, but if you are planning to buy one, just know they will not install it for you due to Covid and the machine itself weighs about 200lbs so be very sure when you tell the delivery guys where to put it.Update: the spot that was cracked when the product arrived completely broke in half after first use. And by first use, I mean walking slowly for two minutes or less. After this first use, it also became obvious that the belt is over an inch off center. So we will have to fix that ourselves as well, no doubt. Will update again regarding my experience with customer service.

  I just finished my first running workout on it. So far so good. I ran 3 miles on it, at up to 5.6 mph. As far as assembly, the instructions are good, and the parts are well marked. It isnât too hard to assemble, but small manufacturing faults make it harder than it should be. I had one hole that wasnât completely threaded. By repeatedly tightening and loosening an extra screw I was able to make it work. Several threaded holes were painted over, making hand tightening a bit difficult. Annoying, but not a deal breaker. The 800 number wants you to register the product to talk to someone. I didnât bother and figured it out myself. In spite of their crafty wording, as others have said you DO NOT have to register with iFit if all you want to do is manual workouts. Simply press and hold the iFit button when you power up.I have had 4 months. I use it for running when itâs too cold or raining outside. So far.... no problems.

",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  I ordered this machine to try to do something (beside eating) during quarantine.My husband put it together in a couple of hours. The only time he needed my help was to assemble the parts that goes under the machine that makes it able to fold.Once ready it is pretty sturdy. Obviously not as the ones at the gym, but mostly because it is smaller. The âbedâ is shorter than the pro, but thatâs exactly why it is perfect for a house, in my case for my garage. It is somewhat light weight. You can move it a little.As soon as you press start it ask you to connect it with IFIT. I did not do that. I pressed the iFit button for 30 seconds and it was override. You CAN use it without the app. BUT, I bought the 5ââ screen. I canât watch anything more than my stats there. Maybe if you buy the machines with larger screens the iFit app could be a good idea. It depends on your likes. But you can totally use this model without the app (6.5s)The machine is very smooth. No weird sound beside the normal sound of the belt running.This machine does not have a fan (I donât need it) , and has good speakers.I do mostly sprints, so I move from power walking with encline for 1 minute to all out for 1 minute for 15-20 min, and the machine works perfectly in those speeds and incline changes. It does change the speed fast. So you need to be attentive.My 5ââ screen shows me cal, distance, time, laps...The folding process is super easy! And like I said before it is not super heavy, and when going down to the floor is smooth, soft and slow. It does not fall fast.It has a space where you can put your phone or tablet on the front. 2 cup (or towels or whatever) holders on the sides. And the STOP button with the strap for emergency.Since âweâ put it together Iâve been using it everyday. And I really like it. I could definitely recommended it.

  Given that it is a very sturdy product, it's no surprise that the shipping box isVERY heavy.  If you aren't comfortable moving 200 pounds of box from your front door, you might want to arrange for a delivery option that includes putting the box where you want it inside your house.  Also, unless you really enjoy DIY with lots of parts, you might want to also chose an option that includes setup.  In our area, which is off the beaten path, Nordic Track contracts with ICON for setup.  I cannot say enough nice things about the tech which set ours up.  Watching him made me very thankful that we opted for professional help.  After 3 weeks we really are enjoying the treadmill.  It is very sturdy and has a lot of features that make working out safe, easy and enjoyable.

  This review is for the T 9.5s. I did not buy it off Amazon. I am trying to write this review solely on the treadmill and not the ifit. Since I've had the free trial of ifit since day one, not sure if some things will be different for those who skip.I've had this treadmill for 3 months now and have used it daily, sometimes even more than once a day. I have the free ifit and love it. That being said, I'm not sure how much I would love it without ifit, I'm not sure if it impacts some of the features,  like, it  takes a good minute or so to start up. I could see how this could be annoying. I go fill up my water and put on my running shoes etc. By the time I am done it's usually loaded up.All the workouts, even manual, start up with a 3 min warmup. This is annoying to me on my manual workouts. Not a deal breaker, just a minor annoyance. You can skip, but you have to wait for it to load.Also, one day my internet was being dumb. I could not get my treadmill to start, even for a manual workout. This really upset me. If some chance the connection is shaky during the workout, it will still go but not save (if you are doing ifit it will just leave you where you left off and not change or save) so this is something that makes the treadmill not recommended if not using ifit.I like the big screen. It has 2 spots on the side for cups or phones or whatever. I can also put my phone in the middle. The Bluetooth connects to my phones and the speakers are pretty good that I can still hear my music while running fast. It also has a tray underneath. I put my 3lb dumbbells there for a little extra for some walks.I do like my treadmill, and I really like the ifit. But I don't think you should waste your money on this one if you don't plan on doing the ifit. It might start up right away without internet, but I really don't know.

  So far so good.  I have had this treadmill (6.5 Si - 10 inch screen) for almost 4 months and it is still going strong.  Putting it together was not difficult but it just took a while.  The functionality is good for a light runner/walker.  The iFit software is great and I have just completed a 6 week beginners running program.  It really helps to give variety to working out on the treadmill.  I had an issue where the iFit programming stopped and there is a way to submit an issue straight from the treadmill and it was resolved quickly.  You need to have wifi to connect to and you can still use it without logging into iFit, but it comes with a free one year subscription and I was able to activate it without providing any credit card info.  Without iFit, you still have some stat measured workouts like speed, distance, incline based workouts but it just shows a lap graphic screen or there are some map based screens.  Not as exciting without the trainers motivating you but it is still good.As far as treadmills go this one is a good one comparable to ones I used to use in gyms.  Sure there are nicer ones but they are a bit more expensive.

  Runs great when it runs.  About every two uses, it blows the power out in the room.  We called Nordic Track and were told since our circuit breaker was large enough to accommodate the equipment, we need an ""arc filter"".  After my husband gave the a piece of his mind for not listing that anywhere or including it with the treadmill, they sent us one.  The treadmill ran for two days with no power issues but has now blown the power again.  Very frustrating to spend this amount of money on something that has caused so much trouble.

  Followed instructions to the letter. Then, in step 16, instructions tells me to install covers over frame base. This step requires me to dissemble about 3/4 of  what I just put together--this should have been step 2, not step 16. I am very irritated. I just left the covers off as they are purely cosmetic. Also the left tray would not attach because screw points were missing/broken off. So I glued it. Activation with ifit looked like it was going to be a bitch, but it turns out there is a bypass.

Customer service reps advised me to buy tools I didnât need and instructed me via video chat to attempt to remove parts not needed to. Waited 2 weeks and  Replaced motor. Waited another 2 weeks and received a motherboard as it was still not working. Will only function if no one is standing or running on it at this point. Paid for 3 year protection plan. Upset that I have replaced the motor and motherboard within 4.5 months. Highly upset  as the reliability and customer service via repairs has been a 2/10 so far. On hold for another 30 minutes currently. Hence why I am writing this review while I am waiting for them to answer.Iâd recommend to avoid these models and buy something cheaper

    Great treadmill

  Â I bought this treadmill back in June of this year and was waiting a little bit to give my review.  Even though it came with a tiny chip on the plastic cover on the right hand side (probably damage during transit), it's not such a big deal because it doesn't affect its functioning.When I bought this treadmill, I wanted something that would be reliable, great quality, foldable, quiet and not so big that it wouldn't fit on the corner of my room. I have to say this treadmill checked all the boxes and even more.  I am glad I took my time to do my research and decided on this treadmill.As other reviews had mentioned, the box is really heavy, so make sure you have someone to help you with it.  Thankfully I was lucky that my husband assembled it which didn't take that long to do it.I made sure I bought a mat to protect my white floors.I've been using this treadmill for a good 2 months now and I certainly love it. It is easy to fold and also easy to unfold. It is quieter than I had expected which is a win for me. I have attached a video for you to see.The machine feels sturdy. It has 2 cup holders that are large enough to fit a bottle of water and even more. Incline and speed controls are on both sides of the front panel to select in intervals from 1-10 or if you wish to select a specific speed for example 3.1, you can adjust it in the controls that are at the bottom of the panel. Incline can also be adjusted the same way. I opted out of the iFit feature by following the instructions of other reviewers: hold down the iFit logo for 30 seconds and you'll be good. For me it took me probably less than 10 seconds but I held it down for more time to avoid any issues. I haven't been able to use the auxiliary music port yet because I mainly use my iphone and wireless ear buds for my workout.In summary, I am absolutely happy with this purchase and would definitely recommend others to buy it.

    The Stuff You Should Know Before You Buy
  
",1.0,jerry wilson,"Reviewed in the United States January 7, 2021","









  
  
    
  I received the product quickly, no issues what-so-ever. It was packaged very well, and overall it seems pretty sturdy and well built. The delivery guys were super nice and helped me carry it inside. It's exactly what I wanted, except for:You cannot use the treadmill until you create an account w/i-fit. It's completely locked out and dysfunctional until you register w/ifit. During the account creation, they require your credit card info (just in case you forget to cancel, so they can auto bill you each month and suck more money out of you). Upon creating the account you are then forced to download and install their stupid mobile app, and then use Bluetooth to unlock the treadmill, verifying they got their hands on your mobile device(s) as well. I tried to avoid this by calling support, but I was stuck on the customer supp lines in an infinite loop of ""you must create an ifit account before you can contact support, press 1"". Once the trial runs out, your treadmill is basically crap, and you're back to a limited set of features. So buying the treadmill isn't enough. You also need to sub to ifit, give them your email, credit card info, phone number & install their mobile app.If I knew all this before I hit buy, I never would have bought it; and, I recommend you don't. In my opinion this type of crap is not only misleading to consumers, but it's just down right dishonest and bs. You should not be forced to dig through their fine print in order to ensure the product you're purchasing is what they depict it as online. I just wanted a treadmill. As a consumer, I paid for that treadmill. But, I got 1/2 a treadmill after my trial runs out. Additionally, I now have to hope they don't get hacked and lose my info as I rely on their ""infrastructure security"", which, conveniently, they do not openly disclose to me. It's not right.

  The treadmill arrived and the two delivery people placed the box in my living room. Great service. It took about three hours to remove  the treadmill from the box and assemble. Then in a very large red STOP sign image the treadmill is locked and you must join iFIT to unlock. Well I don't want to join iFIT I just want a treadmill. After further research  other posters on Amazon stated the workaround is to hold down the iFIT button for about 15 seconds. So now the treadmill works without joining iFIT. Now it is time to register and again their marketing arm gets into the act trying to sell upgraded warranty. Awful ....By the way the treadmill works as advertised although rather large for my house. Word of warning be sure to assemble the treadmill in the room that it will reside as it is 35 inches wide at the console and won't fit through my doors without disassembly.

  Iâve had this treadmill for a week and itâs safe to say it has exceeded my expectations. NordicTrack doesnât make junk. I was a little worried that at this price point it might be suited to walking only. No way! Iâve been running at a 4.5 -5.5 mph pace and itâs incredibly sturdy. The folding feature is super easy. When you let the track down from the upright position it releases very slowly so as not to crush toes/kids/pets. The iFit feature is a slight annoyance, but just make sure the red safety key is in place and hold the iFit button for 30 seconds to disable. Worked like a charm for me. This is, by far, one of the best purchases Iâve made in years. The downside is that the machine is really heavy (200lbs) and, while I paid someone to do it for me, assembly sounded like a beast. Iâd recommend paying for the assembly. Also, this NordicTrack isnât loud in comparison to the average treadmill at the gym, but itâs still loud enough that I canât walk on it in an otherwise quiet house without waking up the baby sleeping in the next room. So, use that information as you will. Bottom line? I have no regrets about this purchase. I love this treadmill!

  I bought a NordicTrack T6.5S treadmill for over $600 through Amazon and received it as expected.  No issues with Amazon.  I followed the user's manual on how to set it up, including purchasing a surge protector according to required specs, made sure it was the only device in the circuit, etc.  It seemed to be a pretty good product but less than a month after receiving it, it stopped working.  I filed a warranty claim with NordicTrack and received a response asking for a picture/video of the motor's LED lights; I emailed the video the next day, October 24th.  It's been two weeks and I've received no response.  I have submitted several requests for status... nothing.  The only good thing I can say about it right now is that my cat likes to sit on it.  If customer service finally comes through and provides some resolution, I will update my review.

  Update: ifit has charged us yet again, even though we have canceled twice...  Please be aware if you buy this treadmill youâll be permanently stuck with a $15 monthly charge for a ridiculous app. My advice, but a plug and play and add what you actually want to from the thousands of free workout apps.Treadmill is relatively easy to put together with decent instructions. It does take two people or one very savvy person to get it.  Itâs definately not gym quality, but it works. When you step off to the sides to start and stop it feels like there is no support, but so far hasnât come crashing in on us!The number one issue we had is that you CANNOT start the treadmill without first logging in and subscribing to ifit. Silly. The ifit isnât necessarily bad, but I want to make that choice, not be told I have no choice in the matter. Ifit Is also very hard to get unentangled from. You have to log in from a desktop... who has those anymore... and tell it 6 different ways you want to end the subscription.In the end if Iâd have realized that ifit was a must, and the sides and front of the machine were such cheap thin plastic Iâd have spent a little more and got a better product

The only complaint I have so far is you canât use headphones with the unit: all you can do is pair your phone or tablet so you can play music (or whatever) through the unitâs speakers. Even the included AUX cable is for input only.

  I only need a treadmill to run on days it's too cold/ hot to run outside.  I bought the simplest Nordic Track T-Series because I did not require any extra features.*  It's great so far with my maximum speed of 6.5 mph (yet I'm more in the zone of 5+ mph until I rebuild some speed and endurance!).It's relatively quiet and, just for assurance, I padded the front legs through the middle roller (for now, with a repurposed yoga mat) to cushion on wood floors in an older 1940s home.For a home treadmill, it recalls what I liked and needed the most from a gym machine.  The lip on the display easily holds a magazine or an iPad.  I really like to zone out and listen to music when I run, so all is well here.Regarding assembly, I wish I added that option with delivery.  A local handyperson helped me with most of it, yet at one point needed help stabilizing the treadmill while adding the hardware that helps it fold and re-lower.  Three thoughts on this: 1)  for safety, it's a two-person assembly, 2) don't overestimate how strong you are, and 3)  when you discover how this treadmill lifts and lowers to save space, it makes you happy you bought this product!  It gliiiiides down to the floor.I am so happy this fits in my 2nd bedroom.  The folding-up feature will help with guests in town.*I heeded some reviewers' advice and held the i[???] button down for 30s.  It worked?  I was able to run and such without needing to subscribe to anything else.  I already subscribe to a running app and try to keep myself accountable in other ways.

  Ok, so the first (and most important) point I want to make: YOU DO NOT NEED A SUBSCRIPTION TO IFIT FOR THIS TREADMILL TO WORK. This thing is PLASTERED with stickers that say the treadmill is ""locked"" and it wont work until you ""activate"" it, this is absolutely not true. Based on other commenters posting about this, I wasnt even going to buy this treadmill, but the other one I had my eye on wound up getting sold out, so I decided to take a leap of faith (hoping that the bypass methods mentioned in other comments would work) and I bought this one. So that being said, everything written in other comments is true - you can bypass the activation of IFIT and the treadmill works perfectly fine.#2 - the treadmill was actually pretty easy to put together. I'd definitely say it was a two-person job. It took us maybe 2 hours. I dont know how anyone did it in 30 minutes, but maybe they have more experience than us.#3 - it's REALLY quiet. Like, shockingly quiet. The last treadmill I owned was 15 years old, so maybe that's skewing my perspective a little, but I am very impressed with how quiet this thing is.Overall, I am extremely pleased with my purchase.

  I have been looking for a treadmill for some time, since working from home in the age of Covid means I am more sedentary than I would like. I am nothing like an athlete. I am in my 70's and have some mobility problems so walking is essential but I am not likely to be running at any great speed. I do, however, prefer an incline.This treadmill was a relatively good price. For the aforementioned reasons, I had no interest in the iFIT program and did not need a large screen. So I purchased the 5-inch screen which is far lower in price than the larger ones.What I liked about this machine was:1. It has a wide 22-inch belt which seemed safer and more comfortable than a narrow one2. It supports 300 lb people which means it's sturdy and solidBoth of these appear to be accurate.It's a heavy monster. I lavishly tipped the delivery drivers who graciously wrestled it down a flight of stairs for me. And I hired a fitness repair company to assemble it. Both were well-spent investments in my opinion. YMMV.I also purchased a 3-year maintenance agreement. If you look at the prices on Amazon, they range all over the place for the same deal, so shop around. In my case, $89 got me a three-year agreement with a yearly preventive maintenance visit. Assuming it is fulfilled, it seems like a worthwhile investment.There are elements of the unit that I do not love. The heart rate monitor does not seem accurate. The instructions are meh and the website is as well.I avoided the iFIT scam because of the reviews here that noted that all I had to do was to hold down the start key for 30 seconds to bypass the credit card request. There is a big notice on the device that says STOP! and tells you that a credit card is required to start the machine.  Not true and tacky.At the end of the day, I spent less that $1000, including the extended warranty, delivery and assembly. I feel it was a good value and it appears to be a solid machine. It fits my needs well. It may or may not be what you need.

  Weâve owned this treadmill for 6 months now and absolutely love it. Glad I read the reviews that state how to disable the ifit program prior to purchase so there were no surprises. Definitely a lot harder to assemble this unit than I realized. I ended up hiring a professional to assemble it using the Thumbtack app. It cost me $80 and was well worth it. The only thing weâve had to do maintenance wise is adjust the belt. The belt had shifted to one side and was rubbing against the side molding. I watched a 2 minute video on youtube that showed how to fix it easily. The instructions for how to align the belt on the nordictrack website were useless, so glad I found what I was looking for on youtube. Iâm very happy with this purchase.

    A solid choice for a serious runner
  
",5.0,galleywest,"Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  Brief background on me, so you can compare your running style and needs to mine in your decision for this treadmill or another:â¢ My details: mid-40s, 5'1"", small to medium build.â¢ Running history: I've been consistently running 3 miles 4-6 times a week for over 20 yearsâ¢ Speed: At the moment, 8:30 to 8:45 minute miles (I'd like to get back to 8:00 to 8:15 minute miles, though)â¢ Style: Almost entirely treadmill running, which has allowed me to avoid major injuries and strains.When the gyms closed due to the pandemic I was forced to take my running outside, which left my feet, ankles, and knees aching.  I knew I needed a treadmill.  I am a treadmill fanatic, having run on many over the years.  I am very picky about what I like and don't like and knew what I wanted: a durable treadmill with good shock absorption which would stand up to almost daily use.  I ended up choosing the NordicTrac T Series with the 5-inch screen.  I have had this treadmill for over two weeks now and have run on it almost every night since I got it.  It meets and exceeds my needs in almost every way.Pros:â¢ Running is very comfortable, the shock absorption is very good--I noticed a difference right away in how my legs and feet felt compared to running outside.  It has been comfortable every night I have run on it, no aches or strains.â¢ It sits flat--I absolutely hate running on a treadmill that is slightly inclined when it is supposed to be at a 0 grade.  If you've ever experienced this you know what I'm talking about.â¢ The size is comfortable, plenty of room on the belt--but I am short so take that into consideration.â¢ The screen allows me to track my distance in either laps (.25 miles per lap) or with a standard distance tracker.  I'm a total nerd about tracking my pace and this shows distance to the thousandths spot rather than the more usual tenths and hundredths (i.e. it shows you have run 1.457 miles rather than 1.45 or 1.4).  It's dumb, but I love this feature.â¢ The speed and incline buttons are intuitive and user-friendly in their positioning on the console.â¢ It's very easy to fold up and pull down.â¢ You can crank it up for a hard run or interval training.  I have it up to 8 mph on occasion and there is no wobble or shake.â¢ The range of incline is good and the movement up and down is smooth.  If inclines are your thing you should have plenty to work with here.â¢ The price was right--for a treadmill of this caliber it was a great deal.  Higher-end commercial-grade treadmills can be upwards of two grand or more, and this was less than half that.Cons:â¢ During assembly there were a couple of times where the screws almost or just didn't quite fit where they were supposed to.  We ""fixed"" it by brute force and a drill, but it was frustrating at the time.â¢ I do wish this version had a fan, but you can always purchase one to attach to the treadmill if you need one.â¢ The heart-rate monitor is useless, but whatever.Unknowns:â¢ I haven't tried the speakers.  I watch my tablet or listen to music/podcasts on my phone and use headphones.  The shelf for your tablet is really nice though, for what that's worth. UPDATE: I tried them, they're pretty terrible.  Definitely don't rely on them.  They are too quiet and the sound quality is pretty bad.To summarize, this is a worthwhile investment if you want a solid treadmill for your running routine (or if you're looking to make running part of your daily life).  I'm extremely happy with it and will be using it for my daily run from here on out.UPDATE:I've been using the treadmill about 5 times a week or so since I bought it a couple of months ago, so I thought I would update on how it's holding up (if that is useful).  Overall, still sturdy and comfortable.  Still very kind to my knees and ankles, which is important to me.  No issues with shaking or squeaking.Two issues I do notice:1. the belt has a tendency to slide to one side or the other while running, so I have to keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't get chewed up by sliding too far.  Adjusting the belt does help but it still does slide.  For whatever reason, once the machine seems to be warmed up and I am running faster, the sliding is much less of a problem.  (Also, as a side note, the last home treadmill we had was far more prone to sliding than this one--it may just be something endemic to home treadmills).2. On occasion when I switch the treadmill on it goes all the way through an incline cycle.  By this I mean the platform raises itself as far as it can and then lowers itself again.  Then it's fine and I start my run.I would not deduct from my original rating for these issues.  It's still a great treadmill and I'm so happy not to have to go to the gym right now!

  I purchased this item for only $599 before the weather got cold. My wife and I dropped our membership at the local fitness center last March because of COVID risk. We went to our local city park to exercise during the spring, summer and early fall weather. With the risk still high, I started shopping for something we could use during the winter. I had owned the Nordic Track ski machine for several years but at 72, I don't have the wind to use it anymore. I looked at the Nordic Track web site and then checked Amazon. I got a great deal on the model I purchased because it has a much smaller screed display than the current models. I wasn't interested in the iFit features so the smaller screen was fine. I paid for assembly but when the guys showed up (without masks) I decided to just assemble it myself. I had them unbox it and put the heavy parts inside the door. They were really nice guys so I didn't even consider asking for a refund on the assembly. It took me 4 hours to assemble it, mostly because I was working in a pretty confined space. I did register for the 1 month of free iFit rather than using a simple override. It's a good thing I did because the machine comes set to metric as the default distance setting. I switched it to miles on the iFit site and it retained the setting. The machine is heavy and seems to be very high quality. I plug my iPhone into it to play music while I workout and the speakers a surprisingly great. I had to do a good bit of tinkering to get the belt to stay centered but it's fine now. There is a very intermittent squeak and I have not been able to get rid of it in spite of YouTube videos on lubricating a few points. I'm betting that when the machine gets a few more hours on it, it will stop. We are using the machine in a pretty confined area but once we put it in the storage position, it doesn't interfere with using the area.  Overall, we love the machine and the build quality should provide us with many years of usage and at the price I paid, it was a true steal.

The hardest part was the screw for the ground wireRapid response to speed adjustmentsEasy to access the drive motor area (Had a wonky connection and Customer Support walked me through it) so it looks like maintenance will be a breezeMost treadmills at this price range do not have incline adjustment or very little. This one has 0-10I watch my  tablet when using the treadmill and the ledge for it is large enough that I don't worry about the tablet bouncing offIt's great to have 2 cup holders - I use one for my iPhone to monitor my heartrate with a MyZone belt. The Pulse Rate on the treadmill is usually pretty close to my chest strap readings, although sometimes wildly off.Neutral - I did not use the iFit feature so I cannot comment on that.ConsThe audio is horrible - really very little volume. Use your headphonesThe display is very small. That is a non-issue with me. When using the treadmill I stream Amazon Prime or Netflix videos to my Fire tablet.Overall impression - It's a great basic treadmill without a lot of bells and whistles. It's made for you to work out, not watch TV or play music. You've got other devices to do that!

    A basic treadmill with a few issues
  
",3.0,TheBlueGrassCat,"Reviewed in the United States December 17, 2019","









  
  
    
  Pros-Easy to put together but had a few things come up during the build. You do need two people at one point when attaching the folding guide rod. The cable you also fish through was confusing on one step where it should go. I took a picture for reference.-Very quit, maybe I have not bought a new treadmill in awhile but I don't have to blast the tv to ear over the unit.-A simple interface makes it easy to do quick changes to incline and speed.-Easy on the knees so far, it seems like the treadmill takes my impact fine.-The calorie counter seems more accurate.Update: Another feature I realized is that if I accidentally pull the safety clip it will remember my spot instead of losing everything, distance, time etc.ConsReally I have to unlock the treadmill through an app that I first have to register and give a credit card to for iFit? I mean give me a break. I canceled the account right after creating it. I just shouldn't have to do this. There is a number you can do it over the phone but I didn't try that just used the app.I am not 100% convinced this folding lock is safe compared to my last one. I mean there is no pin to lock it in place just the rod that you push with your foot. I could see a kid knocking it. I mean it does come down slow enough they should be able to get out of the way but I am not sure how often I will have this in a folded position.Update: I had some issues with the incline getting caught on the bolt coming down. It looked like comparing the lift bracket to the other side the one on the left was bent a little too far out. I did have to use a rubber mallet to get it over just the little bit so I could go up and down on the incline without it getting stuck.

    Disappointing parts quality and service
  
",1.0,WilC,"Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  Pleasantly surprised it was delivered a few days early.  Installation manual was actually quite good, detailed and correct. The reason for 2 stars is the quality of parts and service. Most items requiring lots of screws, nuts and such, usually would pack extra in case of anything. Not NordicTrack, they gave only the exact count.  There was a special screw for the ground wire, and as I screwed it in, the tip broke off. Then, I was unable to screw in one of the screws needed to attach the display to the handrail because the screw had metal in the groove so that I can't get the screwdriver in. Never seen defective screws like this. I called NordicTrack, and it was going to take them 7-10 business days to get ONE screw to me. I chose NordicTrack for its supposed name brand, but the lack of quality control and service was disappointing.Update: I'm lowering to 1 star because it's been 2 weeks and I am still waiting for ONE screw.

    Amazing machine, âroom of choiceâ delivery was promised but not fulfilled by Amazon
  
",5.0,Hyp3rmom,"Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  When researching this treadmill, I saw a lot of negative reviews. I realized that all of the negative reviews were due to Nordic Trackâs partnership with iFit. I was a little apprehensive about having to deal with iFit but decided I would give it my all. A few months later, I can say that I am not a fan of iFit. It was hard to use and would take so long to start the workout that i felt Iâd rather just do without it. It wasted my time (taking so long to load) and would be a source of frustration. Therefore, I unsubscribed after the first free month and thankfully, thatâs was quick and easy.As for Nordic track, I recently purchased my very first treadmill from them. However, Iâm very familiar with Nordic track. Iâve witnessed my cousin using a Nordic track treadmill for years! She raves about its durability, comfort, and quality. I am excited to finally be able to start my own journey  with Nordic Track.Finally, At checkout I choose to pay Amazon an extra fee in return for delivering the machine to âroom of chooseâ. Upon arrival, the delivery company was unwilling to take it up the stairs (the stairs were included in the package I paid for). I had an impossibly heavy treadmill sitting in my front room for a few days. Amazon was unsympathetic  about this and were unwilling to help, even though I had paid to have them take it up the stairs. In the end, they refunded the amount and my husband and I carried it up the stairs. It was back-breaking work but well worth it.

  I received this Nordic Track treadmill back in November 2020 and am so grateful to find one in stock that would ship directly to my home.  Our old treadmill lasted about 18 years so we weren't looking for anything fancy with big screens to follow along with workouts but just a good quality machine with an easy to use display.  It took a little time to put together but my husband was able to follow all the instructions and got it assembled in an afternoon.  One part was broken in shipping and it was easy to use the customer service links on the order to request a replacement part, which we received after about a month.  We weren't upset because it was right around Christmas when all shipping carriers were delayed.  The treadmill folds very easily, the display buttons are large and easy to see, the machine is heavy duty and responsive to incline and speed changes.  I've seen a lot of complaints about the iFit claims included with the machine that you MUST create an account to use it.  All it took was a little research to discover that is NOT the case and all you have to do is follow these easy instructions to bypass that:  hold down the iFit logo on the treadmill for 30 seconds and your treadmill will work.  It has other features like internal speakers and heart rate monitor that I don't use, since I wear a Fitbit and use my laptop and wireless headphones to watch TV and movies while I work out but this treadmill is definitely a great value for the price!

  There was one tiny screw missing for a wire grounding so it wasn't a big deal (since the screw is super tiny and had a substitute screw that didn't fit as well but you could put tape around it so it wouldn't fall out for the grounding - I may use my warranty soon to ask if they can look at that part), but this product is extremely well made: the usability is super easy with the button options and monitoring tools (love the space it saves because you can push up the tred for more floor space) and the assembly is very easy with the organize instructions and pictures and organized packaged tools. Running on it is smooth and doesn't hurt the floor.

  I must say, I read the good.. the bad..the ugly. I had major anxiety while building this as the negative reviews were flying through my mind. Once I plugged the machine in and started it up I was in fact able to bypass the iFit membership and was so happy! I pressed speed 2 and man is this thing peppy. It picked up fast!Overall, the machine feels solid... it is not eating up the small room it is in as it is a great size. It lifts and comes down with ease to save space.My ONLY con..the incline seems a bit outdated. If you do interval training you may have to alter the amount of time you walk or run on that incline to account for the amount of time it took to get to that incline.I am relieved that I did not experience any of the horrors other customers seem to have. I would 100% recommend if you need something basic but solid for your home.

    It will cost you your credit card details and $1 to start it!
  
",1.0,Tony,"Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2019","









  
  
    
  iFit is engaged in a coercive, deceptive relationship with nordictrack.  You are REQUIRED to provide a credit card and pay $1 to simply start the thing.  After you have gone through the trouble of ordering, delivering, assembling, now you are REQUIRED to subscribe to the ifit service to simply start the thing!  There is no way to decline the service.  You have to create an ifit account, provide your credit card details, accept a $1 charge, accept you will be charged $15/month, and then install an app on your phone to start the thing.  If you were as put off as I was, then you immediately, turn around and try to log back in, and trudge around looking for how you can ""End Benefit!""  Also, now they have your CC info!  So I cancelled that CC account to protect that information.  Now about assembly.  The instructions need a lot of work.  There is a table at the front that provide numbers to the parts that correspond to the diagrams, but are not referenced with the parts package.  Simply continuing the numbering reference to the parts package would have taken care of it.  After finally getting the thing assembled, we noticed that the frame was not square and would not sit on the floor squarely; one foot was always in the air.  So we had to jump on it a few times to get it to bend back to square.  So now that we have it assembled, ACTIVATED, and SQUARED, we can attempt to use it...  Writing this review has been very therapeutic; thank you Amazon. Update to follow.1st update.  We had this just two days. It did something strange today. We turned it on and it immediately began to rise. Once it reached the top it began to lower. Once it got to the bottom, it just stopped, waiting to be used.  It was just weird. Thought I should mention it. Otherwise it seems to be working normally now.

  I use my NT treadmill every other day for approximately the past 4 months. Sturdy, quiet. I would definitely buy it again. You can't beat the price for quality, and the payment option is appreciated. Caution - you definitely want to have an experienced technician assemble it unless you have the time and some 'handyman' skill. A second person might also be a benefit. Instructions are fairly clear.Criticisms: adjusting the belt tension is an aggravation and necessary. There needs to be a guide tube to enable easy insertion of the allen wrench (provided) into the two hidden sockets. Especially considering the need to lubricate (by loosening) the belt on the platform every 3 months. A smaller criticism, the platform on each side could be a couple inches wider to comfortably put your feet. I appreciate that the design is to be as narrow as possible. It's a great machine overall.

    Great machine 3 weeks in
  
",5.0,Rickyg1974,"Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  Per the headline, I've had my machine for 3 weeks now and am loving every minute of it.  The only reason I had a gym membership was to use their treadmill.  I canceled that after only 2 workouts on this machine.  Below are the details of my experience from purchase to assembly:Purchase:  As some reviewers have stated the treadmill is a bear to assemble by yourself (which is what I did).  However, if you have a competent friend/family member willing to give you an hour of their time I would bypass the professional assembly.  However, DEFINITELY pay the extra $20 for in-house/desired room delivery (even if you live in a one-story house).  The box the treadmill comes in weighs about 200 lbs.  You do not want to try maneuvering it around your house/apartment without help.Delivery:  As stated above, I use the desired room delivery.  The Amazon delivery service was on-time, professional and capable (although I did have to help the guys get the box around a tricky corner in my building's staircase).  They called once when they were on their way to my location, and again as they were pulling.  I've always been gun-shy about purchasing large items on Amazon, but if this is the level of service one can expect from their delivery service I may do so more often.Assembly:  Again, assembly can be done with one person (it's in no way easy, and you should be able to lift at least 50 lbs by yourself), but I don't recommend it.  However, having gone through the steps there wasn't anything that I thought would warrant paying an extra $70 for a professional to come do.  Just make sure you have a Phillips-head screwdriver,  and either a socket wrench (with plenty of socket heads) or an adjustable wrench.  All other tools needed come with the treadmill.  As others have stated some of the bolts are in hard to reach spots.  Take your time, follow the instructions and assembly shouldn't take more than an hour.  Pro Tip: there's no need to purchase a mat for the bottom of the treadmill (to protect your floor) if you're strapped for cash.  When you take the top off the box, simply cut off the side pieces, put the belt/motor component on the top and use it as your floor protection.  The cardboard doesn't slide/slip at all when you're on the treadmill.Usage:  Unlike some others I actually bought this machine FOR the iFit functionality.  I have an iFit account and absolutely love the service.  From what I read you can cancel the membership (almost immediately) after the machine has been activated.  Personally I love just being able to focus on my run/walks and let the machine self-adjust speed and incline on its own.  Full disclosure though...you really don't need an iFit membership to take advantage of this function.  While you can manually adjust settings like any gym treadmill, this machine comes with (I think) 20 preset workouts that also self-adjust.  I haven't used any of them yet, but from scrolling through the menus they look pretty varied in terms of challenge level.  The machine is quieter than any gym treadmill I've ever used.  I workout watching TV and routinely run at 6 mph without having to adjust the TV's volume.  Transitions between incline and speed levels is smooth and natural.  I also love that you can adjust the cushyness/firmness of the belt.Storage:  The treadmill doesn't take up that much space.  It's a little shorter than a child's twin bed (probably about the same width).  While it can be folded you really don't save that much space with the belt/bed up (since it rests at a angle that's only slight shorter than the length when fully deployed).  I generally leave it down and ready to use.Overall I'm extremely happy with this purchase.  I haven't any issues or complaints 3 weeks in, but appreciate the length of the warranties that come standard with the treadmill (I did however buy the 3-year maintenance plan ).  I would definitely recommend this machine without reservation!

    Very solid branded treadmill. Works great.
  
",4.0,bcapbcap,"Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  First, thanks to reviewer who tells how to over ride activation to iFit by holding down iFit button for approximately 30 seconds until activation screen disappears and normal screen shows up. Great job, and I agree this is just a $s grab. Also, this unit is heavy and awkward to get into your house to setup and locate to final location. Based upon how beaten up, dented and crushed my box was, I would say transportation and delivery was an issue for everyone who touched it. Surprisingly only minor cosmetic crack in motor cover.  Assembly was harder than necessary because of manufacturing and design shortcuts taken by NordicTrack. Instructions were adequate but not great. Some machine threads were not done in the frame, so they supplied a self-threading machine screw. If unfamiliar with a thread cutting screw, Iâm sure some would assume either the hole was too small or the screw was incorrect size. How easy would it have been for them to machine the threads. Also, some of the parts had smaller holes than the screw needed to pass thru to attach part to body of treadmill. Just sloppy parts forming. Some better and more detailed drawings for assembling would have helped. Two people is nice for speedier assembly, but one handy person can accomplish on their own. Final bug: the clip for the safety stop is incredibly cheap. Itâs like a paper clip. For a few pennies they could have had a clothespin type device that lived up to NordicTrack quality.For the good. Once together, itâs a great treadmill. Very solid. Lots of options. Easy to set and change while using tho controls for +/_ on side handles would have been a quality touch. Little to no bounce/sway. Lower noise level. Nice wide tread. Incremental speed by 0.1 mph from 1mph to 10mph. So, all in all, a great treadmill at $600. (Wait for it to be back in stock at Amazon and avoid those $880 prices).

  We bought this treadmill to get cardio in during COVID-19 lockdown, and are very happy with it.  For the price paid, it is very high quality and a great value.  The machine was packed very well for shipping.  I recommend registering the product as soon as you get it built.My wife is pretty happy with it.  It does appear to move faster than the treadmills on a similar speed setting at the health club.  The belt was slightly misaligned to the right, but I found an online support article showing how to make a few turns with the allen wrench to center, super easy!  The stride length is very good for us both, so we never feel like we're going to fall off the back.  The electronics are attractive and simple to operate.  Belt operation is smooth and relatively quiet.The treadmill releases very easily to fold up if you need to move it out of the way.  We have dedicated a space in our media room for it, so this is less important to us.  Assembly took maybe an hour, and the instructions were very easy to follow.The only complaint I have about the workouts is I wish the arm support bars extended a bit further back.  I find that when resting my hands on them, I have to orient my body a bit too far forward, and the tips of my shoes will sometimes tap on the kick panel covering the front of the belt.  Also, there are some rough edges to the plastic where they were removed from the mold right at the end of the hand rests so I need to file those down - very minor annoyance.I don't use the ifit.com subscription - you can disable this as others have noted on first use by holding down the iFIT button and letting the machine reset itself, maybe 30 seconds.  I prefer to watch movies or listen to music while using so this was not a feature that mattered to me.Overall I'm very happy with this purchase and with the support from NordicTrack!Pros:+ Quality/sturdy construction+ Ease of assembly+ Fluid motion/incline+ Excellent support+ Attractive design+ Great value/price+ Well packaged!+ Easy to fold up/move (wheels are great)Cons- iFIT unnecessary IMO- wish arm rests were a bit longerI would not hesitate to buy this treadmill if you're considering one in this price range.

  First and foremost FOLLOW OTHERS ADVICE. The thing will beep at you like crazy in attempts to resist and they have put flyers all over it claiming to sign up for IFit to unlock it. Hold the Ifit button for 30 seconds to unlock no need to pay. shameless scam. absolutely disgustingInstructions say need 2 people to assemble this is not a joke. If you are not a handy person DO NOT BUY THIS. They don't provide you the correct tools to assemble, the pieces don't fit together properly, the screws don't fit any of the holes, and the parts are cut wrong too big or to small. The parts in the shrink rap are labeled wrong, the instructions refer to the wrong parts and wrong locations.I consider myself very handy; the horrible design, poor production and lack of attention to anything that might be considered ""detail"" made this a horrific profanity laced  2.5 hour assembly. The ""assembly"" comprised of having to force pieces together, use an impact drill to get enough torque to get screws INTENDED FOR DISCARD out of the damn holes and then to get the intended screws that were too big to fit in the hole into place.I can't rail hard enough about how horrific the design on this nightmare of a product was. You would think NordicTrack as a recognizable brand would mean quality. FAR FROM IT.Once it was together it appears to work as designed although it leaves plenty to desire in aesthetics, options and software quality. User friendly 3/5.This product is lazily designed, slapped together and farted out for consumers to hate every life choice that led them to this nightmare.Is it a Treadmill? YesIs it also a demon spawn sent to torture your last cell of sanity? Also yesIs it a blatant scam that they company has still refused to rectify? Also, Also yes.

  1. Takes long time to assemble and it takes two common skilled people to put together.2. Folding is a joke. When it folds up, it only folds to about 60 degrees. Not straight up 90 degrees to get out the way.3. Trying to move it while it is folded is impossible because of how awkward it folds and where wheels are positioned.4. I am 6'1"". The front and side grips are way too low to hold onto while walking so useless you want to hunch way over while walking.5. The heart monitor is useless. It always reads in the 80's and 90's.6. The sides of the belt where you step off to take a break while the belt is still moving are useless. They are dangerous because they are angled towards the belt and are way too thin to get your entire foot on them. Try stepping on them and part of your foot is still on the moving belt which can make you fall on your face.I am very disappointed in this purchase.All these good reviews are either fake or from short people who never need to fold it, move it, use the heart monitor, or use the side steps.

My question is they are asking me to troubleshot brand new treadmill? It should have been checked before the tread mill left the factory. Even registering the warranty on their site is a head ache.

  First of all, I would like to mention that my husband and I were very happy that our treadmill arrived earlier than we expected and the packaging was in very good condition, no big gouges in the box.  Thus, we felt confident that the treadmill did not suffer any kind of damage during transport.  We removed all parts from the packaging and assembled the treadmill.  It requires 2 people to assemble this treadmill, but it's not complicated or confusing as the instructions are clear and easy to follow.I've been using this treadmill at least 3 times per week for 3 months now and I have been very satisfied with its performance.  I find the treadmill to be sturdy and it doesn't make any annoying sounds while in use.  I like that there are 2 ways for adjusting incline and speed.  The only feature that I wish the treadmill included is a cooling fan.  However, I have remedied this by placing a small fan in front of the treadmill to cool me while I'm working out.  I actually look forward to my work outs even more now that I own this treadmill.

  I wanted to write a review on this because of all of the reviews saying the ifit was a scam or whatever. I got the old model and it came with the basic ifit 1 year plan. I set it up when I set up the machine. I didn't have to input my credit card number or anything, it will just end after the year is up. You can still use the machine without it, I usually just use the track anyway because I listen to my own music and the ifit coach people annoy me. My kids use the ifit coaches because they like the videos of people going into pyramids or caves. It only has the walking, jogging, and running videos. Anything that involves other workouts is not included with the basic ifit membership.Now, my review. This machine was super easy to set up. I did pay the 20 bucks to have someone bring it into the house since it had to go up a flight of stairs and around a tight corner. My husband set the machine up in maybe an hour. I only had to help with a couple of things.I absolutely love the incline on this machine. It does it automatically and totally rules. You can make the machine go faster and the incline higher in single increments or .1 increments. I'm not an athlete so I've been slowly working my way up. For example, I started at 2 mph and a 0 incline and I'm now at 3.5 mph and a 6 incline. It's nice to take things down or up a notch depending on how I'm feeling.The machine is also very easy to fold up and down. I do it with every workout since I have the machine in our bedroom.It doesnt have a fan or anything but theres a fan in my bedroom so it's fine. It's just kind of annoying if I get started and forget to turn the fan on. But it's easy to pause the machine as well so not a huge deal.I dont like the big power switch on it for some reason. I'm on computers all day so it feels like there should be a shut down switch on the screen. It makes that ""you shut the computer down manually"" click noise that makes me uncomfortable. But that's just a personal preference and not a real complaint. This treadmill is the best for the money!

  Like a lot of people who were used to using the cardio in the gym, this virus lockdown was problematic. We bought this early into the stay at home orders in CA.  Given the relatively low price I was concerned about it being stable-but it is plenty solid for us.  We use it primarily for fast walking but I put 6-7 miles on it a day (sometimes more). Don't expect what you can get for 3-5 thousand (it isn't like a gym model-but functions similarly).  Nice incline, good read out.  If you are fairly handy-can use simple hand tools and carefully follow instructions, you can do the build yourself. There are a couple of places a second set of hands helps.  It is a process-I think it took me a couple hours (and I build things a fair amount).  The reviews that tell you not to fall for the attempt at selling the on line trainer crap are accurate.  After you get it set up just hit the blue ifit button and it will bypass the screen that has you enter the code to sign up.  Once you do this the machine stays in manual mode and you wont have to mess with it again. If you want the ifit thing you get more functionality out of the preset controls-but all I want to do is walk, jog and incline sometimes.  There is also a pair of speakers that you can aux cord connect to (would be nice if it was blue tooth). There is a small shelf on the monitor that you can put your iPad on.  Overall, super happy with this for the price.

    Good Quality, Great Value

  I was looking for a high quality treadmill for jogging/walking that had simple features. I've used really good treadmills at various gyms and wasn't willing to use a cheap-feeling treadmill. It is great quality. It is easy to use with manual features (increase speed, incline, etc.), but also offers shortcut buttons to quickly get up to speed/use programs. You can track all the basics (calories, distance, etc.) from the treadmill. I started out by using the iFit app, which is pretty simple to use, but decided to discontinue my subscription because I enjoy pretty basic, quick walks/runs. Other people wrote reviews about issues cancelling iFit but I had absolutely no issue and was glad I tried out various programs. It was nice to know I have the option in the future if I want it. Assembly takes a bit of time, but I don't think that's uncommon for workout equipment. Overall happy with the quality and functionality.

  The Nordictrack T6.5 Si arrived on time and in one very long and heavy reinforced cardboard box.  It took two delivery men to bring it inside my house.  With the help of another person, I wanted to get it upstairs but we had trouble maneuvering this 209lb unit in its large box around a turn in my staircase, so I decided that it would go in my office on the main floor.  No problem there.  I carefully followed the instructions and found them to be extremely well-written and with adequate detail.  If you prefer to use a video to help build it, there is a free App called BILT that has this unit in their catalog and it follows the same exact steps as the written guide but with the addition of some nice 3D images that you can rotate.  It took me about 3 hours to assemble but I worked slowly and double checked all steps.  For someone who has built one, it might take 1-1/2 hrs.  Once assembled, I was able to login using my home Wifi and immediately it told me that there was an available firmware update.  No issue updating, but it took a good 10 minutes or so to complete it.  I logged in using the included 1 year free iFit family membership and added myself and my wife as users.  There is an option to bypass the iFit membership but why do that if 1 year is totally free?  After that, I calibrated the incline as per instructions and that worked out fine.I have tried two of the iFit level 1 (the easiest!)  workouts and I loved them!  First I took a walk called ""Niagara River Cultural Walk"".  This was 0.85 miles in duration and basically mostly flat with a few includes up to 2%.  I love the way that the machine adjust walking speed and incline automatically and the instructor provided an excellent overview of the area while walking along with you.  The next day I tried a different walk ""Inner Crater Walk, Rano Raraku, Easter Island"" (0.71 miles). This one was also level 1 but slightly more challenging as the incline went up to 6% but still a relatively simple and easy workout.  The instructor gave a great overview of the history and the views were spectacular.  Not quite like being there but very nice and easy to see on the 9"" built-in LCD monitor.What I like (so far):* A very nice solid machine, well-built and sturdy.  It looks good and is almost as sturdy as those expensive ones at the Gym.* This model was in stock at Amazon even though it was on backorder at Nordictrack's own website (go figure!).  I got it something like 4 days after ordering.* I found a better price on Amazon (check several vendors - as price varies).  In fact it was lower than direct from Nordictrack.* Great instructions on assembly and very easy to follow.  There is a step that recommends two people for safety reasons.* Love the iFit App.  I know this isn't a material part of the treadmill but it certainly makes using it a lot more fun.  Anyone that bypasses this App is losing out.What I didn't like (so far)* The built-in Android tablet boots up slowly and some of the touch screen functions seem slow to react.  Not a big issue but it is a bit slower than modern technology should be.* No Bluetooth to connect audio from an external device to the built-in speakers.  There is a 1/4"" jack socket so you can use a (not included) cable.  Haven't tried that yet.* The built-in handlebar for measuring pulse rate seems to be very erratic.  During the walks I took it wandered from 49 (too low) to 177 (way too high) but occasionally it seemed to be about right.  You can buy a chest pulse rate monitor which I am guessing will be more accurate.Overall, I really like this treadmill, I think it was a great purchase.  Recommended.

  I can't even begin to explain how much I LOVE this machine!!!! I do feel like it's important to mention that it was very difficult for my husband to put together and he's been a carpenter for 15 years so he's really handy. Also, once it was all assembled, it wasn't working properly so I contact tech support at Nordictrack. They were very patient and helpful and worked through multiple troubleshooting techniques for over an hour. Unfortunately, the problem was deeper than the surface so we couldn't fix it. They apologize multiple times and sent out a new console which I got about 5 days later. I connected the new one and it works great! I LOVE LOVE LOVE it! The workouts really keep you engaged and the fact that the machine does all of the work in terms of adjusting the speed and incline makes things so much easier! I don't have any joint pain so I feel like the suspension works really week. I got the 10 inch screen (T-series 6.5 Si) and the screen is roughly the size of an iPad - much larger in person than it looks in the picture - plus the video clarity is great!!!

  Warning! If you buy Amazon's expert assembly and want to return a defective item, they will make you disassemble it yourself.As soon as we turned it on, it made a terrible noise that gets louder and louder as it increased speed - sounding like a jet engine. Something is definitely out of sorts with NordicTracks quality control. I paid for Amazon's expert assembly and they even tested it before ""approving it"" but they disregarded that it was obviously defective, which we found out only an hour after they left.Other issues: the belt moved over to one side so i adjusted the tension to balance it out, hoping that would make it stop, but it did the same thing while the belt was perfectly centered.  Very disappointing for a brand new treadmill. Would be much better off getting one locally from a Sporting goods store

  The treadmill was delivered on time and in perfect condition. Assembly took about 2 hours and was very simple. The treadmill looks great and the touchscreen is gorgeous, but without iFit is loses a lot of the appeal. The big problem is that the 1-year subscription to iFit is nowhere to be found, and NordicTrack (icon fitness) have horrendous customer service. It took over 24 hours to get a response which was just a canned request for my activation number to ""look into the issue"". If I had the promo/activation code I wouldn't need to contact you!From a functional standpoint the unit seems good. It's solid and runs fairly quiet, but the missing iFit subscription really hurts the value proposition. It does seem like other people have received their code, so your mileage may vary, but if this is an indication of how customer service works you better pray the machine never breaks.

  Very glad I picked this one after studying so many of them. For $599 you get a quality  treadmill with a very basic information screen. Treadmill section is high quality. However that basic 5"" screen will display everything you'll need to know during your workout. And believe me when I say ""you DO NOT have to register for, and pay extra for iFit to use this treadmill. Once I first held the iFit button down for about 20 seconds I never had to do that again. Everytime I power it up I get on it, set my speed and start walking.

  Not what I wanted. When we received the package the top of the console was already broken.

  I have this a three star review for a few reasons. None of which deals with the function of the product.First, the ""timed"" delivery was two days early. While this was a positive, it was completely unexpected. The drivers were very curtious. They even brought it into my apartment, rather than leaving it in the hallway as requested.Once they left, I inspected the box. It was completely damaged. There was pieces of the box missing, and the product was actually exposed. I immediately contacted Amazon and confirmed it was safe to open the box.While my husband assembled the treadmill, there was a piece of the base that was broken. We completed the assembly. The dimensions they provide in the description are for the deck only. This became a problem, since I live in a small apartment. I pre-planned the designated space for this. This was pointless. So we  rearranged our living room for it.That being said, we've used it several times now. It works flawlessly. I like the functions. I don't subscribe to their workout thing. I feel the main console is way oversized. The heart rate monitor is not acurate, but neither of us use it. Overall, I think it is a good treadmill. Just didn't enjoy the ""set up"".

  I am an avid runner (65+ yrs) and my wife is an avid treadmill walker at the YMCA.  We both have been considering getting a treadmill back into the home as an alternative to the Y and, yes, I will run on it when the weather is bad outside.  We wanted to keep the price point to below $1K and after a bit of research decided on this model.  It arrived on time and after I gently got the heavy device down to the basement I assembled it within 2 hours.  Thanks to some prior Amazon posts, I knew to press and hold the iFit button to activate without having to enroll in the iFit subscription.  The product registration is separate.  The treadmill is great.  Purchased the floor pad as well.  We don't need all the iFit extras.  This is simple to operate and nice to have now that we are all locked down.  Happy Trails!!

  I chose this mode because it seemed to be one of the most reasonable priced in the 200+lb weight limit family, and it was a good name brand I felt I could trust. Put it together myself, it's definitely a project and you'll need a second set of hands to help hold things in place. My first issue is how you have to bypass the ifit subscription which other reviewers have mentioned. You do that by holding down the logo button as others have said. But more so than that I'm only about 5'9 and I feel like I'm too tall for it. Especially the handles and the screen and all of it. My second major issue is how far out the plastic comes on the top part over the track, because of this the handles don't come out far enough so you're stomping on the plastic when you try to hold onto the handles. It's a really big design flaw in my opinion. The track also is jumpy and not smooth at all. It seems to go WAY faster than other treadmills. The 1 speed is extremely slow but 3 is a full on brisk jog, I can't imagine what 10 is.

  Disable iFit: press & hold iFit button (should hear one beep) and console will boot up & bypass iFit sign-up. If you hear some R2D2 type stuff, take your finger off and try again.**Note**Assembly was pretty easy, I did it myself and took my sweet time with it. Be mindful that the console support bar comes attached to the console. I almost went Hulk thinking I was missing a part and the instructions make no mention of having to remove it from the console to install on the upright arms.Aside from the above, I love it!!! Cardio is key to good health. Noise is on par with others I've used. I am somewhat tall with a long stride and heavy landing feet. Its nothing that will drive you crazy or anger the neighbors. Pressing & holding the numbered speed keys will increase in .4 increments ( from 4 to 4.4),(no clue why it wouldn't be .5 but its cool). No need for a fan on a treadmill lol thats silly, same with some fancy lcd screen. Running is about zoning out and getting lost in your mind, not having a fan hit your face while watching youtube. Easy to adjust & center the belt. You will need assistance to install the parts under the belt assembly. I've owned a Nordic Track treadmill in the past which is why I got this one. They are built very well and assuming you arent trying to be Usain Bolt, should hold up 5-7yrs easy.

  2 things very wrong with this item.  1st, the price fluctuates by ~$400 week to week.  If you bought it (the cheapest one with 5"" screen) for ~$1080, YOU GOT RIPPED OFF AND ARE KICKING YOURSELF!!!!!!  I paid $637.  A week later it was $1090, today it's $720.  I would be livid if I found out the following week that I overpaid by $400.2nd, they make it VERY difficult to opt out of iFit by making it seem you can't use the treadmill until you unlock it by activating iFit which is BS.  What they don't tell you is to press the iFit button for 15-30 seconds and it will disable.  You have to call customer service or do research to find this little tidbit out.That being said, it's a treadmill.  Does squeak a lot when using it.  The fact that it folds up brings nothing to the table unless you plan to put it in long-term storage.  You're certainly not going to be moving it around after each use.  Weighs 200+ pounds.  Assembly is not complicated but will take an hour or two.

  Based on my experience setting this treadmill up and starting my first use, I think ethical people should read this review and strongly consider not buying from Nordic Track and its affiliated companies.  Here's the story, in as few words as possible.I let my teenage kids set this up from out of the box, with my guidance on one spot where they got stuck.  But, when they tried to start the treadmill, they were required, by the directions and by the Nordic Track website, to sign up for some ""IFIT"" software program in order to actually turn the treadmill console on.  They tried to do it several times, but I (their dad) wouldn't give them permission to use my information, and they came to a standstill.I then tried what they had done to get the console started, to the same end.  Nordic Track would not let the treadmill be used (the console is needed to run it) unless the treadmill was registered and I signed up for the IFIT software, along with my personal info and credit card info.  I balked/rejected that option, and performed an online search on how to use the treadmill without doing what Nordic Track required.  I found the workaround (I won't mention it here, because I detest having had to do that), and my family is now able to use the treadmill in the manual mode (only).So, after I was done with the bypass step, I was able to very believably imagine an evil Nordic Track person-employee (who maybe doesn't even know they are evil) laughing about how hard it was for me to protect my family, particularly my kids, from Nordic Track using strong pressure tactics and disinformation  to get extra money and personal info.By the way, my kids all agreed that I should write this review.

  As other people stated, they try to force you into the iFit scam. Just hold down the iFit logo on the console for ~30 seconds to clear the locked screen so you donât have to give your credit card info and get scammed by the manufacturer.I have only used it one day so I am not able to give an honest review of the functionality and longevity but it seems good so far.The assembly is not near as bad as other people stated. It probably took me an hour and I wasnât in a big hurry.My only reason for the one star review is them trying to trick customers into giving their credit card info when itâs absolutely not necessary. Iâve seen other people complain on here how they waited hours on hold trying to either cancel the membership or find a way to use the treadmill without signing up for a membership. The fact that they try to scam you into signing up tells you something about their business practices and gives me concern regarding warranty issues that may arise.

  The treadmill has 3.0CHP motor which is barely minimum for running workout. But the Bluetooth is for audio only, cannot be used to synch with IPAD for better streaming experience. Either buy the T6.5S which is underpowered with 2.6CHP motor (with Bluetooth IPAD support) or the expensive T8.5 which has the larger 10"" screen but is $700 more expensive. There are some liars out there that give wrong answers(yes) to my questions about use IPAD synch with this machine, as console. There is a tablet holder but is not at eye level, you have to keep head bend down to see it. Since  you cannot pair IFIT on IPAD to this machine, it allows you to run the video without pairing, this is the workaround I am using. I run my IPAD and the 7 inch console program at the same time to give me a better view of the streaming scenery. I would not have made this choice, if their website information is not misleading.

  I gave it a 4 star because I had to do a lot of adjusting of the belt to get it centered and also to get the tension between 2 and 3 inches.  Also the belt squeaks when I walk on it. It is quiet when running without a load.The assembly was easy but it takes me time to work on bolts that are close to the ground. I have trouble with my back so it took about 4 separate efforts to finish the bolts, not counting the final tightening required after assembling the display panel. If I were younger I would have done the job in about 45 mins including understanding the instructions.Thanks to the reviewer who told me how to bypass the internet stuff.  Pressing the Ifit button for 30 seconds did the job.It will take a little time to get in shape.  I have arthritic pain from walking so it will take a while for me to get a decent ""workout"".  At the moment I am doing 13 minutes about 4x per day.Folding and moving is not too hard. It is on a rug and that is where the resistance is made more difficult.  If it were on a hard floor it would be a cinch.The delivery guys were great. It was well worth it to pay an extra $20 to bring the unit down a flight of stairs.

    DEFECTED TREADMILL WOULD NOT RECOMMEND! DO NOT BUY!
  
",1.0,Kenneth Chau,"Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2021","DEFECTED TREADMILL WOULD NOT RECOMMEND! DO NOT BUY!

Pros
1. The treadmill absorbs the impacts when running at 10 mph and does not shake the surrounding area.

Cons
1. Some of the manufactured parts were defected and would not align accordingly which made assembling difficult.
2. Activating iFit â and the loophole to getting around it (courtesy of another Amazon Customer). After assembling your treadmill, turn on the treadmill, attach the key, then hold down the iFit logo on the treadmill for 30 seconds. This will skip the need to activate iFit and your treadmill should be working now.
3. NordicTrack Customer service experience was not helpful.
4. The incline/decline buttons would not work upon activating the treadmill. Treadmill was stuck at 0% incline grade upon activating the treadmill.

BREAKDOWN OF UNPLEASANT EXPERIENCE:

2021.01.17 - Day 0 - Received and Assembled Treadmill.

2021.01.18 - Day 1 - Ran on the treadmill for the first 15 minutes with no problems at incline 0% and then the belt stopped moving. I figured to turn off the power and let it cool down for a couple of minutes and would attempt to run on it again. The belt would barely move and I had to drag my feet as if I was kick starting it. But the belt would just stop moving again. I continued this pattern for about 30 minutes and gave up.

2021.01.19 - Day 2 - I attempted to run again at incline 0% and the first 15 minutes was a success until the belt stopped moving again. I attempted the same method as Day 1 but to no prevail, so I decided to look at some reviews on Amazon.

Common concerns with the treadmill per Amazon Customer Reviews:
1. The control panel needed to be replaced and ordered through NordicTrack Customer Service which can take weeks to arrive (the control panel is a green computer hardware looking piece underneath the hood).

2. The motor was misaligned and needed to be adjusted.

3. The walking belt was not tensioned correctly (walking belt is the part that you actually run on).

All this requires the removal of the hood of the treadmill for examination (the hood is the part your toes point to while running and is attached by 5 screws).

2021.01.20. - Day 3 - I removed the hood to examine the motor and itâs aligned. So I decided to run on the treadmill with the hood off to see if the belt stopped moving due to an overheating motor. To my theory, the treadmill worked perfectly for 40 minutes straight at incline 0% and different running speeds. Curious to see what NordicTrack Customer Service had to say, I decided to give them a call.

I explained how the treadmill belt would stop and the theory about the overheating motor to customer service and their response was for me to record the control panel the next time the belt stops moving and to call customer service back within their hours. The control panel will blink in a pattern of red/green/yellow/orange light which then will determine the issue. So I wasnât able to confirm the reason why the belt would stop moving 15 minutes into my run.

So I then brought up that my treadmill would not incline/decline and was stuck at 0% grade.

So customer service made me run through some diagnostics with them. I had to download an app called âVisual Supportâ which worked like FaceTime. Customer Service was able to see through my camera and walked through step by step with me and see how the treadmill was responding.

The first diagnostic was to open the hood and review the cables connected to the control panel. They verified that none of the cables were damaged and that the cables were plugged in all the way.

The second diagnostic was to review the red and green light that the control panel was emitting.

The third diagnostic was to test the tension of the walking belt and lift the walking belt about an inch high to ensure that the belt was not tight which would create friction and not rotate. No issues there.

Fourth diagnostic was to slide my hand underneath the walking belt and confirmed that it has been lubricated. No issues there.

The fifth diagnostic was to recalibrate my incline/decline function as I was not able to get it to work upon activation. The steps were:
1. Click on âSETTINGSâ
2. Then the â^â (three buttons away from SETTINGS)
3. Then click on âINCLINE ^â
The treadmill will begin recalibration and start to incline to 10%. Then the treadmill is supposed to decline back to 0%. However, my treadmill was stuck at 10% and would not go back to 0% no matter what we try. Customer Service examined that the control panel was flickering red and green light but not reacting to the commands.

Customer service was shocked and confirmed that the control panel was faulty and not reading the commands of the display board. So they placed an order for a new control panel.
Customer Servicer stated that I will receive a confirmation email that an order for a control panel has been placed and is being processed. Then I will receive a separate email that confirms that the order has been shipped. Then I will need to replace the control panel myself by watching a YouTube tutorial.

2021.01.25 - Day 8 - the control panel order is still in processing and has yet to be shipped.

I am stuck with a treadmill that is inclined at 10% and cannot be lifted to create extra space.

I am on the verge of just contacting Amazon Customer Service to just return this faulty treadmill.",Display Size: 5 InchesStyle Name: T 6.5 S Treadmill + 1-Month iFit Membership

    3 problems
  
",3.0,Isaac Surh,"Reviewed in the United States August 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  Overall, it's a decent running machine for the price. But I have three problems with it. First, one of the screws (the silver screw used with the grounding wire) they gave me was the wrong type of screw and did not go into the hole. I had to use a drill to widen the hole and only then did it go through. Second, the machine shakes more than I anticipated. Some reviewers said it doesn't shake at all but it does. If you want a running machine that feels rock solid, you'll have to go with a more expensive model I'm afraid.Third, and most importantly, there are numerous BOLD messages that tell you that you cannot unlock or start up the machine without registering at ifit.com. It's written everywhere and no where does it give you an exception. But as other reviewers have noted, you can bypass the ifit registration simply by putting in the red magnet key and holding the ifit button for 15 seconds. I agree with others that this is grossly misleading and may even qualify for false advertising. A major brand like NordicTrack shouldn't stoop to these gimmicks. They should do better.Hence, my honest 3-star review. If I could give 2.5 stars I would.

  Not to bad to setup.  I think it took me around two hours alone and taking my time.  The box had one tear in it but nothing was damaged - shipped on a pallet.  My only problem with shipping was they did not deliver it to the room like I paid for.  I eventually dropped it on my foot getting it into place and two weeks later it is still having slight pains.  Amazon refunded the fees for me though.  The company was Pilot, so if you end up with them know they are taking covid measures seriously and won't help you out.treadmill itself:-its nothing fancy - the screen looks like its from the 90s-the speaker is garbage-the floor board seems cheap, but works so far(kinda loud) - with AirPods pros noise cancelling I still hear it-the cupholders seem dysfunctional? maybe I haven't figured them out yet, but everything rattles very loudly.  I have went around and given everything a retighten as well-the fold up shock works nicely-the quick speed settings are nice- seems to take awhile to slow down - such as 8.0 to 4(slow jog) or 2(walk) which is somewhat jolting and dangerous-heart rate monitors don't seem to work wellThat's all I can think of. overall not bad. beats paying double the price to run in place

    It Takes Two!
  
",4.0,K. A,"Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've had the treadmill (6.5 si) since April 23, 2020. It came a day early (pre-arranged with the delivery service), which was nice. I love it, don't regret buying it, and have used it every day.What I didn't know is that you need 2 people to assemble the treadmill. If it stated that somewhere in the specifications before I purchased, I missed it. But, it is written on the first page of the manual, which you should read before assembling. You could probably use a third person to read the instructions while the other 2 assemble and bicker :) I consider myself pretty handy when it comes to putting stuff together but I made a few missteps. The whole thing took 3 hours to assemble (subtract a half an hour for the missteps, sometimes confusing instructions, and difficult screws).It's very sturdy and bigger than I expected/wanted. It's very easy to fold and open but also requires 2 people to move it (also stated in the manual). I suggest that you assemble it where you plan to use it and don't plan on moving it too much or too far. And if you plan to put a mat under it make sure you assemble on the mat.  The screen is a nice size. I got a 10-inch touch screen, which is big enough. No Bluetooth. Has an audio jack to connect other devices.It came with a 1 free year subscription to IFit, which I like. Although I think that IFit could stand some improvements, like better organization of the classes by level but it could be that I haven't learned how to fully use the App. The subscription allows you to sign up four secondary users. You can use the treadmill manually as well, but I like that when you do an IFit class the machine automatically adjusts the incline and speed to the terrain in the class.Update 1-10-21: I have no complaints about the treadmill. It's still working well and definitely worth the purchase. Additionally, over the last few weeks/months there have been some improvements to the IFit program. It is now Bluetooth compatible and you have access to contemporary music playing in the background. You can lower or turn off the music as well as the trainer's voice during the workouts, which was always an option.

",4.0,Mark A. Premselaar,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2021","









  
  
    
  This treadmill is probably overkill for us, but we wanted to make sure that it would last as we planned to use it.  It has a large screen so that it is easy to see.  Controlling the speed and incline is easy and can be done in two ways.  It is comfortable to use and quiet while you are using it.  You are also given several choices of pre-pepared scenes that will give you a choice in your workout.There are a few things that we are disappointed with though.  This particular model does not allow you to set the time that you want for your use.  It is not the end of the world, and you can clearly see the time and distance you have walked/run on the screen.  The heart monitor leaves a lot to be desired.  Perhaps we would have been better off had we bought the optional Bluetooth version that goes around the body.  It is still an option for us, but our watches do keep an accurate account of our heartbeat.  The other thing that needs to be included is a warning that the hex key, that comes with the treadmill, has different sized ends.  While trying to adjust the track, I was unable to make the adjustment.  It did not appear that the hex key was matched to the adjustment screw.  It occurred to me later to look at the hex key to see what was wrong, and that is when i noticed that the two ends were different. I was using the wrong end of the key.  Once I noticed that and used the right end, I had no problem making the proper adjustment.

  I am completely satisfied with my NordicTrack T Series Treadmill. It is very substantial, making me feel perfectly comfortable walking or running. (I weigh around 195 lbs.) It was easy to assemble and easily fits in the smallest bedroom in our house. It makes a little bit more noise than I anticipated, but my family swears they can't hear a thing from other places in the house. It is extremely easy to program/use. There are short sidebars for steadying if you need that. I feel like I have more than enough room and almost never use the sidebars. There are 2 areas (pockets) for holding your water bottle, mobile phone, or whatnot. The emergency stop feature is there if you need extra assurance in the event of stumbling or falling. I especially like the incline feature; I sometimes want to be able to raise my heart rate without having to run, so I set the incline to 2-4% for additional intensity.

  Much nicer than my previous treadmill (Gold's Gym). Wide track, very powerful motor, easy to use features. Can adjust speed and incline from control panel. Reasons i did not give it a top score: instructions were not well written and clear, seems to squeak, raising track up and lowering seems awkward, and the main reason was the big push by Nordic track to use the online trainer to the cost associated with it. If i had not read the reviews online I would not know how to bypass the online feature. Also, what was point of putting a speaker in the unit if it sounds weak and terrible, drop that feature and write better instructions instead.

    Backbreaking Assembly. Critical parts (from factory assembly) missing
  
",1.0,Brendan,"Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2021","









  
  
    
  Firstly, assembly is backbreaking work. I consider myself handier than the average person, solid with tools, etc. And this is not for amateurs. Save yourself a terrible evening and get a different product or a professional to assemble the product.After about three hours, despite many parts not fitting into eachother (poor drill jobs in steel frame pilot holes), I finally assembled the product into a usable state, only to find that it was not positioned well and was lopsided. I'm an engineer so I took the frame of the base apart to diagnose the issue. The freaking factory never finished  assembling three small pieces that are absolutely integral to the product's use. A 3/8"" Jam Nut, a 3/8"" Plastic Bushing, and a 3/8"" Washer were nowhere to be found.The product is unusable. I'll get parts at home depot and attempt to salvage, but I'm awfully disappointed in such a poor product from an otherwise well known name.Lastly, you can't even use the product until they push you through a clunky series of websites, links, and apps that coax you into purchasing their iFit monthly membership. You'll be so frustrated with your product setup you'll probably do it just to get to use the product, and I imagine most people probably will.I expected a lot more out of NordicTrack, but I guess they've lost their quality over the years. Next time I'm going to spend the extra few hundred dollars with a competitor. Really kicking myself for not getting a Peloton at this point, would have been worth the headache.My advice is try a different brand. Hope this is helpful.

  We researched treadmills for weeks, then I read every negative review and almost didnât buy this treadmill, but my gut kept telling me this was the right one. It arrived securely boxed with no damage. We added expert assembly (initially thought we could do it ourselves but many of the negative reviews started with âI assembled it EXACTLY like the instructions said, but......................â, so we decided to let a professional do it.). It was assembled in 2.5 hours when we were quoted 3-4 hours. The delivery company and the assembly company were very professional and organized, familiar with the equipment and knew exactly what they were doing. We opted out of iFit (when you first turn it on, just press and hold the iFit button down for 10-30 seconds and itâll jump to the home screen) and have used it several times since receiving it. Itâs on wheels but is still pretty heavy, so we set it up behind our couch. My family can sit in the living room and watch TV or a movie with me on the treadmill behind them. Itâs not any noisier than treadmills at a gym, so the TV volume just needs to be bumped up a smidge. Iâll edit this review if anything goes wrong, but so far so great!

It ONLY works with iFit, which is this very expensive, monthly exercise service.  That's it, the bluetooth connection ONLY connects to iFit, that is your ONLY choice.

    A decent enough treadmill for $1000
  
",3.0,Michael E. Oswald,"Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've had my treadmill for a couple weeks now, and it's not great but good enough for what I spent. The console is nice, and it comes with 1 free year of I-Fit which is pretty cool (although I doubt I will renew it because the renewal costs more than a gym membership). The features are nice, and the treadmill seems solid. Here are the problems. The heart rate monitor doesn't work at all. I have an Apple Watch so I can live without it, but it's listed as a feature and doesn't work. I can be drenched in sweat, panting and my Apple Watch is registering a heart rate of 165, and the treadmill bounces back and forth between 58 and 62 BPM. Another flaw is the area on the front of the tread is too short, if I hold onto the heart rate monitor rail my foot steps land on the cowl that covers the front of the tread. I weigh 185, and it seems the treadmill slows down a very small amount every time my weight comes down on it. It's definitely not as robust as the ones at the gym, but in fairness the cost is much less. It is very slow to transition between inclines. It takes nearly a minute to go from 0 incline to 10. Overall I'm happy with it, it's good enough to burn some calories on days when I don't feel like a trip to the gym. It's pretty quiet.

  I like this treadmill a lot--It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of a treadmill in a professional gym but it doesn't cost as much either. I think for the price this treadmill is a great value--it feels solid, it has the electronic incline function (not manual), the speeds should cover most if not all home users (I run a lot and the speed settings of 5 - 7 are about as fast as I'd run outside).I'm still considering the extended warranty since sh*t can happen, regardless of the extent of use and I'm sure it'd be expensive for parts and labor. I saw some negative reviews of the extended warranty saying that it doesn't cover the technician's trip to your home.

  We assembled the treadmill (took several hours) and after my iFit subscription registration and treadmill machine (product) registration, I turned on the machine to get started! Unfortunately, after successfully connecting to my wifi and ifit account, the treadmill immediately went to the screen âuh oh your safety key was removed and your treadmill wonât work until itâs put back on....â problem is the safety key was ON! My connections seem good. Called nordictrack and after some troubleshooting she said sheâll send me a new key (which is just a magnet) and i told her I donât think itâs the magnet. She said there is no choice and this is the first step... well that was feb 10th and I still donât have the replacement safety key.... I did talk to another rep and she said that itâs probably gong to be a new console but they canât send one of those out until a they send me a new key to try. And Iâm like thatâs a crazy amount of time wasted.... she even said it will take weeks for the console to be replaced. So hereâs where Iâm at: a 250 pound machine just taking up space, fresh out of the box and assembled successfully by me and my husband, to only sit in the corner and be useless. Nordictrack is messing around by âtaking certain stepsâ towards remediation. Problem is it appears they sent me a junker. I dislike having a machine malfunction upon arrival but then to have to wait weeks for a remedy? I donât like it nordictrack! I have called Amazon and asked to return the machine.... it is scheduled for return on feb 19. This machine has been nothing but a space-taker.... took my time upon delivery (I wrote a review of the Amazon delivery  experience I had); then took up time to assemble it; it took my time to call Nordic track twice; itâs literally taking up space in my bedroom; itâs huge box is also taking up space in my bedroom waiting to be be picked up by Amazon; I will be giving up my time waiting for a delivery pick up window to get rid of the darn machine! Ugh I am unhappy. A $1100 machine that wouldnât work out of the box and the company has the slowest response. I didnât pay over $1100 for a huge machine to just SIT and take up all my time and space but NOT WORK.Update 2/16/21: new red safety key arrived. Of course, the treadmill still doesnât work. I called and spoke to a super rude nordictrack rep named Gabrielle who told me it would take another 3 weeks at minimum for them to send me a new console. I explained how that is the most extremely inconvenient and tbh awful solution! Remember, this was a brand new treadmill I just bought from Amazon and itâll just be collecting space and dust in my room for another month? And with no guarantee itâll even work when their solution (console) arrives. I am so upset and this has been the worst fitness purchase Iâve ever made.

    Bypass iFit by holding the iFit logo
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  The treadmill itself works great.  It is sturdy and much quieter than the one we had previously. The one hesitation I had buying this was the iFit trap they try and pull you into, but the recommendation on how to skip it worked for me: just hold down the iFit logo on the console and it will bypass it.  Once bypassed it does not return. For assembly, I was able to put it together alone just having my girlfriend hold pieces upright now and then. Just make sure you have your own tools, the ones they provide you are not adequate. Of particular note is that their screws are very shallow, so you may need to play around with different Phillips heads before you find one that works properly.On a side note I had my delivery time with Amazon listed as between 12 pm and 3 pm on a Saturday but woke up to repeated phone calls and text messages at 7:15 am that morning because the delivery guys were outside.  I am not going to have this reflected in the product rating because it was clearly a mix-up with the delivery company but I was not happy about it.

It does everything I need it to. I assembled it by myself in a little over two hours, and the directions were very straightforward.  I followed the tip about holding down the Ifit sync button to move past it. I didnât even want to deal with the hassle of cancelling it in a month so I didnât bother setting it up.  Itâs not obnoxiously loud and I can hear my music and TV over it well. I recommend this treadmill for anyone wanting the basics and an affordable treadmill.

  If I could give this bike zero stars I would. I would give it negative stars if possible. From day one, we had issues with product. When we ordered the product it let us pick the date to be delivered so we picked the following Saturday. Apparently this company doesnât deliver on Saturday (company outside of amazon) and they moved our date two weeks away. I called amazon and they told me to contact the shipping company which was AWFUL!! They changed the date on us again FOUR more times before receiving it. Once we did the box looked like it had been dropped and destroyed. Not to mention the two young men who brought it in looked 16 and dropped it twice bringing it in from the car. We get it and it takes 5 hours to set up. Everything works fine for a few weeks until I use the incline and it stops working. My fiancÃ© manages to get it fixed and it works for a few more weeks until I use the incline again. Now itâs completely broken the screen wonât turn on and NordicTrack says itâs no longer under warranty even though I bought it in July and itâs now November. I have been a runner my whole life and was trying to train for my first marathon. I will never buy another NordicTrack treadmill or exercise equipment from amazon again.

  Now that I  have finally assembled the beast, so far itâs great. It was delivered by truck, one man. The treadmill was on its side , then pushed off the truck so it landed on end. Handle with care was not in this guyâs vocabulary. Iâm 73 and have a bad back. I had to help him slide it onto my ground level porch. Really awkward and heavy. I drug it into my living room and unpacked it. Then I carried it into my family room with the help of my grandson. It was assembled fairly easy. I plugged it in, it didnât work. I registered it with Nordic track. Called, got help from a tech. She determined I needed a new main board. I waited eight days for the part to be delivered. I installed the board, put all back together, plugged it in and it didnât work. Called again and was guided through the analysis again. By the way you need a smart phone for that, thatâs so they can look at what I was seeing. This tech determined it was the power cable that runs through the leg. I waited another eight days for that to arrive. Again, didnât work. Called again, now the tech said it had to be the upper unit that contains the tablet. He ordered that, another eight days. The next day I was getting prepared to install that, so I unplugged the two connections for the electrical wiring from the upper unit to the base. I noticed that three wires were missing that come out of the cross handle where the unit measures your pulse. I called back, talked to tech, he looked and said whoops, itâs not the upper unit, itâs the part where the wiring comes from the key. He cancelled the upper part and fedexed the handle. This time I only had to wait 5 days. I got all back together and everything worked. Oh, the treadmill doesnât like my satellite internet so I now donât have iFit. Other than that it works just fine.

  **DO NOT BUY THIS**This item is impossible to return even when it malfunctions or does not work as advertised. I am 280lbs and the tread mill stops when stepped on in lower speeds. After 15 miles of use in higher speedS the motor is much louder than it should be.When I attempted to return the item that is not working, the Amazon selected freight company never showed. when called the stated they didnât have a route driver. The second attempt wouldnât pick it up because it wasnât returned in its packaging.  Not sure who has room to keep a 5 foot box and tons of styrofoam laying around, but if I did it wouldnât have gone back into the package that was ripped during delivery.Basically, the return process is designed to make you keep the item, please donât waste your money.

  Iâve had this for about a month and I love it. It is sturdy. But it is a heavy piece of machinery so although it folds up and down very easily it wouldnât be easy to move it out of the way. So it stays put in my apartment which kinda defeats the folding but hey, itâs there if I must move it. This is my third treadmill from Amazon and Iâm keeping this one. To be fair this one is twice the price of the other two that I have returned. So if you can afford it pay the double amount and donât deal with putting them together and then deal with disassembling and sending back. This was easy to put together but you need two people and follow the instructions step by step. Iâm also very greatful to the person who put in the review for not turning ifit on by depressing the button before first use. It really takes care of dealing with cancelling it later.

    A Bit Tough to Assemble, But Works Fine So Far--Updated 11/24/2020
  
",3.0,Bruce,"Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  After having a neighbor help me move it downstairs and around two tight corners, it took me about 4 hours to assemble.  Were I to do another one, could probably do it in two hours.  Pretty much a one person job, though there are a few steps where an extra set of hands are useful for short periods.  I'm a bit unhappy that some of the fasteners were missing and one of the hand holder bolts simply would not install (not sure if the hole was stripped or the bolt made poorly).  I'll make do with three of four holders since they're pretty large bolts, and I was able to scrounge up the other missing fasteners in my garage.  The instructions could have been a bit clearer, but they were workable however time consuming it was to figure things out.  I opted for the 7"" screen; it's a bit small, but workable for iFit and I've got a large TV mounted on the wall (wish I could throw the 7"" to the big TV, but there's no HDMI port on the 7.5 as there is on some of the more expensive models).  Considering that I purchased this at a huge discount during a sale, I'm quite pleased with it.  EDIT 3/17:  Now that I've put a few days of workouts on my treadmill, I like it even more.  Maybe my favorite part is the iFit Google Map application.  I live in a hilly part of town and now can walk those hills without fear of getting run over.  Amazing how the incline adapts as I climb....hit a flat area....then climb again.  You also get more or less a slide show as you walk, based on Google maps tracking.  Yes, it may be dated, but there are plenty of recognizable landmarks.  I've also tried a few of the iFit routines and they're pretty good and interesting as well.  I'd probably opt for the individual subscription after a year since my spouse is more of an elliptical user.Update 5/5/2020:  Loving this treadmill more and more everyday.  It's a 5 star as far as performance goes.  During the Covid isolation, I enjoy that I can go for a run on Easter Island with a trainer, or simply devise my own routes wherever Google maps exists; today, London tomorrow the rest of the world.  Very cool.  BTW, my wife doesn't use her elliptical much anymore once she got on this treadmill.Update 5/21/20:  Raised this to 5 stars.  The benefits far outweigh the almost forgotten installation process.  Now if only it had a decline mode, but that would make it cost twice as much, so I guess I'll have to get used to running the downhills on Google Maps at 0% elevation instead of an actual decline.  Since this was first installed in early March, I've dropped 28 pounds (obviously by incorporating exercise with better eating habits) and my resting heart rate has gone from 82bpm to 67bpm thus making my heart a lot happier.  Additionally, have reduced my 400 meter time by more than 30 seconds.  This really isn't  about bragging as extolling the benefits of having this machine in my life.Update 11/24/2020:  I've dropped two stars from my review.  The treadmill is horribly out of calibration and has been since I received it.  How would one know?  In my case, I bought a Garmin Forerunner for outdoor workouts.  Lucky me, my treadmill was calibrated in a manner that I was running and working much harder than it indicated.  So now when I'm training for a 5K with a 27:00 goal (hey, I'm over 70 so don't laugh),  I've learned to use training methods for 27:00 outside and 29:00 on the Nordic Track.  That's a HUGE difference, but it works, so its telling me that it's around 7% out of calibration.  The big problem is that the NT website states:  Many recent models, including all models with touchscreen consoles, do not have the capability for the user to calibrate the speed"".  Well, what the heck sort of lousy engineering and lousy build is that?  It's difficult to get through to a CSR, but when I do I expect to hear the same answer I read on their website.  Too bad.  Guess I'll have to to use my mathematical skills every time now as I reach different goals.  Unfortunately, they have some great races on ZWIFT which I'll never get to credibly compete in since my treadmill is so out of whack and Zwift uses the treadmill distance indicator.

  Not a bad treadmill.  The only issue I have is the squeaking noise while walking.  When the last tech service came to my house to move from one room to another.  I mentioned it to him.  He said add oil, I said where?  where it squeaks.  But this is brand new machine, had not been use because of the location.  He just left without solving the issue.The squeak is totally annoying!!I have a question, with the new technology these days, how can you connect you phone to the machine to hear the music through the speakers without signing up for ifit?  there is no UBS port but a pinhole.  Current smart phone use USB Ports.

  This treadmill is not a good choice. Hard to assemble. The advertisement of free assembly by an expert seems to be a scam. They tell you your order will arrive in 5-7 days, but that only includes the assembly service and not the treadmill. If there is nothing to assemble at your address how can they assembly the treadmill? The treadmill takes about 15 days to arrive. My first review was denied because I didn't follow ""guidelines"". I have a feeling a lot for the reviews for this product ate denied making it look better than it is in reality. If this review is denied I'll just write another and another until it's posted. Because I had to write this again the review went from 2 stars to 1. Dishonest service and advertising for this product. Do not buy.On top of all that after you have it assembled you are forced to sign up for a trial session of ifit, the fitnesss workout program that comes with the treadmill. There is zero mention of this when you purchase the product. I find this highly misleading as well.Dishonest, shady, just not good all around.

  Last August, I bought a NordicTrack treadmill at Amazon. Two months later, it stopped working. I am asking the company for help; they are not finding the solution to the issue, after two hours of waiting for the phone to talk with a representative.  I asked them to exchange the machine, and they answered that they could not exchange it because I bought it from Amazon. This situation is making me anxious and very upset. I am feeling disrespected as someone stilled me.

    Shocking customer service from ICON Fitness, mediocre product.
  
",1.0,G Lasala,"Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2021","









  
  
    
  Short version: Pretty sure the product is decent, but couldnât even get it fully assembled, and the customer service is an absolute joke. Very unprofessional and super unresponsive. Hopefully your product works good and assembly goes well otherwise youâre in for a rough time trying to get anything done or hearing anything productive from them.Long version: Purchased treadmill at the end of July, began assembling it and noticed the screws on the left handrail that supports the main console could be secured properly. It had to be a defect of some sort as the screws on the right handrail had no problem. We probably could have forced it in, but we didnât want to compromise the console as that is a pretty heavy portion of the treadmill that should be properly secured, especially with all the impact coming from using the treadmill.We contacted icon fitness (parent company) about the issue and they said that the spare part is on back order but they will send it as soon as they can. After a month, we checked up on the situation, and was told the replacement handrail was sent two weeks later. Unfortunate part, the new handrail had multiple defects INCLUDING the same problem the old handrail had. Not only were the screws unable to be properly secured, but the rubber grip and the plastic cover on back end of the rail were both missing completely.Naturally, this wasnât ok, and we proceeded to contact them (Icon Fitness) again about this new part, only to be constantly told over the next several months that the part is on back order and will be sent as soon as they can. Given the pandemic at the time, we chose to be patient, but eventually that patience came at an end. We had gotten the product in July 2020, and by October 2020 we still hadnât gotten anything and our attempts to speak with a representative were met with vague commitments and unprofessional interactions on their end. We wanted to get a refund, but they wouldnât even give us any kind of options since it was sold through Amazon, even if weâve had a partially assembled treadmill for almost four months. We managed to get something sorted through Amazon (thank you so much) but the whole experience regarding NordicTrack and Icon Fitness has been a nightmare.But the story doesnât end there. We had the product returned through Amazon around November 2020. Just the other day (which is why Iâm writing this review) we actually got the new handrail delivered. At the end of January 2021, despite receiving it in July 2020 and returning it at the end of October 2020. It ended up becoming more comedic after such a frustrating experience.If you read it all and are still considering purchasing one, I hope you either get it professionally installed, or have a smooth installation experience. Otherwise prepare yourself for a rollercoaster of a customer service experience!

    Good overall treadmill. Bad customer service
  
",3.0,K&J's Dad,"Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  Overall I would give this treadmill a 3.5 out of 5 stars. Assembly process was not bad. Took about 1.5 hours to complete. Instructions were pretty easy to follow. However, the incline motor for my treadmill is defective. Thankfully I have a warranty but so far customer service has been mediocre at best at helping me fix it. They ""said"" they ordered me a new motor and scheduled a repair person to come out but that was about 2 months ago.  A less patient person would probably be freaking out by now but Im cutting them some slack with the c. virus going on right now. I paid for 2 years of extended warranty and honestly I don't think would recommend the extended warranty. The performance of the treadmill (aside from incline) is good. Motor runs strong and it's a comfortable run. There are a lot of different runs you can go on with the iFit too which is pretty cool. If they actually do come out and fix the incline I would give this treadmill 4 out of 5 stars (minus 1 star for customer service). NordicTrack it's the year 2020. You guys really need to up your customer service game and make it look like you are on standby waiting to attack any problem your customer might have. Currently I can tell the people you have in place are probably some teenagers reading from a manual while chewing bubblegum and watching anime.

  For me the unboxing and assembly took some time. In fact I still don't have the bar underneath  the treadmill so you can fold it upright connected. First off I'm only 5-3 120 and I was able to get the Treadmill from the garage to the basement family room by myself. A don't do this at home idea. As far as the assembly it was a little more difficult compared with other complex assemblys. The parts were all there. That was nice. All you need is a wrench, and phillips screwdriver. There are very few parts. I normally have tons more screws when assembling another product. The manual is clear enough. I wish the holes in a couple of important parts were a tiny bit larger. However, I switched to my own screws and then came back and used there's. In other words it takes a lot of force for there's to go through the steel. A power drill might work better than screwdriver. I had a confusing part with the dashboard cable caught in the bolt hole area and called customer support. They took had me take a photo and she was able to determine how the cord was misplaced. Excellent support help that I might not have figured out.I don't see what everybody is complaing about this ifit problem. My theory is take the one month free and see what the maximum features are and if you want to eliminate the monthly charge just cancel and it runs great without ifit. The features on ifit are fun and I love the way the coachs control the incline and speed according to your exercise. You do have the ability to override the features.The product is typical Nordictrack quality. A very nice treadmill to run on. Its big, comfortable, runs quiet, variable incline and speed measurements at 1/10 intervals. Plenty of room on the sides so if you want to hop off and keep the trainer going while you rest is nice. The bluetooth connect to the ifit works great. With an ipad it works nice. You can realign the belt which I didn't need to use. I haven't tried the ipod speaker idea. There are speakers but haven't had a chance to use them. I like the display with many different features to so and emphasise in front of you. Nice pulse tracker if you like. Being able to just hold onto the crossbar and measure how much effort you are putting into the exercise. Nice easy to read display and I have the smallest one. That is plenty large for me. Again I watch the videos on my ipad which sits nicely on the display.Overall, I wasn't happy during the assembly. Always complaing but that seems to be the norm when its a difficult assembly. Once I had it together I really like this machine. Its heavy, sturdy and made to last. Haven't had it for long but for the price its a top of the line model and glad I didn't go with a lesser known brand. I would recommend.The free one month Ifit just isn't all that bad and you can bypass that idea but I didn't consider that idea.

  I wish I could comment on how this treadmill actually works but after 3 months I still DO NOT KNOW! I ordered this treadmill in October 2020. It took a month to receive the treadmill. I put it together immediately to discover it doesn't work. I contacted NordicTrack that same day I put it together and they determined there is a short in the console.  They ordered me a new console. However after 2 months I am still waiting for said console. I have contacted NordicTrack numerous times to only be told it would take 2-3 weeks, however after 8 weeks I'm still waiting. After the 4th time of contacting them I finally got answers saying the part is back ordered.  No one at NordicTrack seems to care that I've had an inoperable treadmill for months. I normally wouldn't write such a review but I was recently contacted by NordicTrack to write a review in which they stated ""We value customer feedback and are willing to send either a floor mat or maintenance kit as a thank you for posting a review!""So here is my customer feedback...do yourself a favor and DO NOT BUY THIS TREADMILL or any treadmill from NordicTrack unless you want terrible customer service from a company that clearly does not care about you after you have bought their product. I imagine any glowing review of NordicTrack it because someone received a free good. Poor business tactic.

    Aggravating assembly, OK function
  
",3.0,,"Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2021","









  
  
    
  I've had many treadmills, from bargain basement price to thousands of dollars: none of them lasted past 2 years without a ton of hassle. I've given up on finding the âperfectâ model and now I aim for the middle: a treadmill with decent basics that I can walk and do light jogging on, with some extras but not all the complex bells and whistles I never seem to use. This one fits the bill for my minimum standards.HOWEVER: the assembly of this thing was awful, unnecessarily so because of poor quality control alone. Screw-holes not properly threaded so screws wonât fit. You get exactly the number of parts needed, no spares, so don't accidentally drop a screw or washer where you can't find it. The neoprene sleeves on the handbars were cut unevenly and misaligned, I had to trim them down to get the crosspiece mounted. In addition to the paper instructions, you can download the BILT app which provides step-by-step 3D assembly. If everything had been properly machined and tooled, this install would probably have taken 30 minutes with minimal effort. As it stands with all the problems and crappy quality, I spread it out over days since I had to buy other screws and recover from the aggravation.Iâm not using the speakers/stereo functionality of the console (you'll need to manually plug in your device if you want that, very throwback). Display gives you the typical options. Incline works smoothly and you can adjust the shock absorber things under the track if you prefer a firmer or bouncier run. Folding up and down is simple. The console and other parts are mostly plastic and feel pretty cheap. There are wheels on the rear legs to assist in moving but they are pretty tiny: no matter how you tilt, the metal legs are still close to the ground and I tore a piece of my treadmill mat that way. Overall, a decent treadmill and (probably) worth the six hundred or so I paid, if it lasts 2 years.IMPORTANT: don't get roped into the âFree Trialâ for iFit unless you know you want to subscribe long term. Just hold down the iFit button on the console for about 30 seconds and it will activate the treadmill for use without you having to sign up for anything.

No one was available to talk to until the following Monday (off for holiday and they don't work weekends in service department). Said they needed to order a part but it was on back order with NO ETA. Continued checking back regularly and finally was told it would arrive by the end of December. It is now Jan 23 and no part.  I've called several times over the past few weeks, sat on hold for an hour before hanging up, being disconnected, or told to call back because they were training employees and not taking calls.  Today, I was on hold for over an hour but finally got to talk to someone! Same news as last time- part should be in within the next 1-2 weeks and then they will ship it to me. I'm not holding my breath. I loved the machine for the month that it worked.

    Severe customer support issues with brand new treadmill
  
",1.0,Susan P,"Reviewed in the United States September 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  I received my treadmill about two and a half weeks ago and hired a professional technician to assemble it.  It took several hours to complete the assembly.  When we finally turned on the unit, a huge tear in the belt (hidden throughout the assembly process) rotated into view.  I registered the product and requested service to replace the torn belt under warranty.  That was two weeks ago, and the company has made no effort to contact me or correct the problem.This is a brand new 300 lb treadmill that I ordered weeks ago and had professionally assembled.  I do not want to return it and start all over again when all that is needed is a new belt.  However, NordicTrack is leaving me with no choice with their abysmal customer service.  What a huge disappointment.My advice is to stay away from this company until they improve on their commitment to customer service and to correcting issues with brand new units.Update 9/18:  I received no response from the three online service requests I submitted to NordicTrack over the course of three weeks.  I finally steeled myself to an endless wait time and called their customer service number.  The rep offered to send a belt but expected me to perform my own repair - for a brand new product under warranty.  Iâm not handy, and have no interest in doing treadmill repair.I arranged for a partial return with Amazon, who discounted the product sufficiently to cover the new belt and technician.  I sure hope this machine never breaks, because NordicTrack wonât provide any support.Amazon handled my problem very effectively.

  This treadmill has so many issues I'm not sure I can keep it.1. I was able to put it together myself, even though the instructions indicate you need 2. I don't have someone that would come over with the COVID stuff going on. I used bungee cord and these straps that you use to move heavy furniture, as my 2nd hands.2. There are a few problems when putting it together.3. The first, the instructions state to use a screw driver and an adjustable wrench. It was impossible to tighten the bottom screws for the legs to the main body with a wrench. I ended up using a 9/16 ratchet to tighten. The wrench wouldn't even fit where the screws were located (image #1).4. The other issue, the instructions say (p. 12 & 13)  ""push the upright wire into the right upright leg"" but that doesn't work. The problem is the wire from the console doesn't fit the space that's left available between the leg and the arm. So I had to tuck the wire under the console (image #2).5. The other issue with the console wire,  you can't screw in the right side compartment holder because the wires are in the way of the hole (image #3).6. The leg cover doesn't cover the cords that are left out at the bottom of the right leg so I'll have to cut a space in the cover to allow room for the grounding wire (image #4) and the other wire  (image #5).  Maybe I installed the wire wrong but I don't see another way to attach the wire to the grounding screw from the inside.7. I was excited to use it but first I had to get around the IFIT registration requirement. Everything in the paperwork suggests that you have to register the device with IFIT to use it. First, IFIT requires a credit card to set up, even though they say the first 30 days are free. That seems deceptive to me so I called customer service and they said to push the IFIT button for 30 sections to enter manual mode which will bypass the IFIT registration.8. The motor is soooo loud.  It sounds like a dead engine trying to make it up a hill, this combined with the sound of your shoes on the belt is very distracting.I'll have to try it for a few days, but honestly, the other treadmills are outside my budget.

    Waiting for New Panel - UPDATE - PAY ATTENTION!
  
",1.0,Momma Shans,"Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2021","









  
  
    
  UPDATE:  In my review below, I mentioned that Amazon/NordicTrack won't just replace the panel, they needed to replace the entire treadmill.  Delivery of the new treadmill arrived this morning.  The drivers stated that they were delivering only and weren't picking up my 1st defective treadmill and that I would have to make different arrangements with Amazon for that to happen.  We opened the replacement treadmill and SURPRISE!  This one also has the manufacturer's defect.  The entire row of preset workouts is missing.  Makes me believe that NordicTrack is just trying to see how many of these they can offload to unsuspecting customers without them noticing.  We refused the delivery and called Amazon back.  This time, they offered me 3 options:  Try a 3rd replacement (no thanks!), return the treadmill altogether for a full refund (we considered it) or they would give us a refund of $258. We felt this was a fair trade.  Not only would it save us time and money, any loss of value if we try to re-sell this in the future will hopefully be accounted for. My suggestion:  It IS a great machine but go buy it at your local store and make sure you have the right buttons on your panel before accepting it.I'VE ATTACHED PHOTOS OF HOW THE PANEL SHOULD APPEAR AND HOW THE PANEL FROM AMAZON ACTUALLY APPEARS.I've scrolled through the customer review photos on this treadmill and see that MANY of the buyers have had the same issue and haven't even realized it.  There is an entire 2nd row of preset workouts on the top row of the panel (the row that has the ifit icon).  It is missing on many of the photos here and was also missing on my panel.  I called Amazon and they reached out to NordicTrack.  It is a manufacturer's defect that they are aware of but for some reason aren't requiring a review of the equipment they have in stock.  The bummer?  They won't just send me the replacement panel.  They have to send another entire new treadmill.  Amazon stated that we could just open the box and take the new part that we needed and put the defective part back.  I hope so because my husband spent hours putting this together for me and I don't want him to have to do it again.Other than this glitch (which is hopefully easily fixable), the machine is a beast.  It is solid and sturdy, substantial and very quiet. I may or may not even use the presets once I get more familiar with the machine, but for this price, I want what I paid for.

    Great Treadmill

  Let me start by saying you can bypass the iFit registration. That is NOT necessary to use this treadmill.  Press the blue iFit button on the display and hold until it flashes and beeps. Then you can use the manual or the manufacturer built-in workouts.I assembled  the treadmill by myself, but yes, having a second person to help hold is nice (Iâm sure ha ha!).  The instructions are super easy to follow, and the best advice I could give you is lay out all the parts and separate the packaging right from the get go. Keep your work area tidy and put your tools back in one location before you start the next step. Took me about 1 hour to do alone.The treadmill is great for what I need and was looking for. Itâs very sturdy and is fairly quiet (I find running is actually quieter than walking). It doesnât have a lot of bells and whistles, and it allows me to control my workout.A few words to the wise: when you hit stop from running or walking, it stops, like almost immediately. It doesnât have a slow down, so just be ready for that or put your legs on the sides before you hit stop.  Also, when you stop the workout and have the incline up, you have to push the button to lower the incline before you shut it down. Do not forget to put the incline to 0 before folding up for storage. I also read a lot of reviews that said the customer service was terrible, so I did get the protection plan as well when I purchased and registered it with the company. I also read all the other companies had terrible customer care, so I figured itâs all the same, and hope I never need to call them.So if youâre looking for a great quality treadmill thats simple to use for your daily run, walk, workout routine, go no further.

  Great treadmill for the price. I almost cancelled my order when I read the bad reviews. Do not read the bad reviews they are not all correct I didnât read all but whatever I read  scared the hell of me. First of all do not assemble it yourself. I donât care how handy you are unless u assemble treadmill on a regular basis. I hired an company they did great job everything works as stated. Heart monitor is exact. One of the reviews mentioned that heart rate is false itâs not. I wear an Apple Watch and heart rate is same as what Apple Watch displays. Yes it came with a plastic part broken during delivery but itâs just cosmetic it doesnât affect the running or walking factor. Bottom part and motor cover were broken but called manufacturer and they are sending the parts and schedule a tech to replace them.  Amazon was great to give me an extra discount because of that as long as itâs safe. Incline is correct I know because I belong to a gym I know how incline works. I think most of the reviews are from people who tried to assemble the machine themselves . True some said machine came with manufacturers defect but  you always can call Nordictrack and get help.  I love this treadmill especially my gym is closed now.

  As for the treadmill, it seems well constructed, was very easy to assemble and has made my wife pretty happy - win. You can press and hold the iFit button down for approx 20 seconds and bypass the monthly reoccurring membership to work out if you want - thanks to whoever posted that in their review earlier as I clearly do not want to pay a monthly gym membership at home.As for buying large objects like this through Amazon - think it out and set your expectations. I have found Amazon to be completely reliable for printer ink, woodworking hand held tools and equipment, cleaning supplies... coffee... BUT I have not had good luck buying larger freight shipment items. This was scheduled for delivery on July 23rd and we received it on August 6th. We paid for the deliver to room of choice - XPO the subcontracted delivery from Amazon almost left the box on our curb but we heard the truck and went out and after a short discussion they agreed to bring it 200+' up our driveway and roll to our back patio where I assembled it. XPO was absolutely awful. I had to call Amazon to get in touch with them and they are a freight service - not a customer service type business. They could give a hoot what you think, feel, or want... they'll deliver it to you when they are darn good and ready. From the package tracker we saw that the treadmill arrived in our city on the 24th of July. Amazon said we needed to wait until the 6th of August before they would refund or reorder and viola, on the 6th of August in the afternoon it arrived. The box had significant damage. The packaging inside the box was rumbled. The upright rails were scratched and one of the side plates on the belt assembly has a cosmetic dent in it. I say all of this to help you temper your expectations. Prime meant free delivery but ... you might want to pay a local retailer to deliver your machine.As for the treadmill as a whole. This is a very basic model which is exactly what we wanted. If you're looking for a fancy full of features and video deal you'll need to spend some more. As for us, we'll watch TV or listen to our Bose sound and really just want the workout.

  GREAT treadmill. Especially for the price. Yes, the iFit button hack is one of the main reasons this is a five star and not a three star, but w/e. Can't knock a company for trying to come up with extra monthly income. Let's talk about the machine itself.First off: definitely try to get the delivery people to deliver this as close to the room you want as possible. Especially if you live alone. I didn't think 200+ lbs was that big of a deal when I saw it in the description, but trust me...it is a chore lugging up and down stairs. Thank God for delivery folk.Next: just putting this together can be daunting if you don't have another person. The first couple of steps are manageable by yourself. Putting the handrails together, getting the wire through etc...it's annoying, but definitely simple and straightforward. HOWEVER: at the end...when you are trying to get the hydraulic lift pole thingy in place by holding up the 200 lb machine and unscrewing then screwing in bolts...yeah. That can be a real b-word if you are trying to do it yourself. I highly recommend having a friend or husband or large dog or something holding the machine up while you work it lest you have it just fall on you and kill you.Running on this thing has been pure joy. Thanks to COVID, we're all trying to avoid icky germs and being around other people. Hence gyms = nono. I found this machine as good as any that I have used at most of the gyms I've been to, though it is without some bells and whistles and it is only ever going to be as sturdy as you make it since...well..you are putting it together.It's a good buy. Worth the price for sure. Just remember what I tell you.

    Three stars because once it's assembled it's great
  
",3.0,Grace,"Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  First and foremost, I had quite an issue in the beginning. Like many of you, my treadmill came broken. Initially, I didn't mind it at all, I just called customer service and said that I don't mind keeping it but I am not willing to pay for the full amount only because it's not brand new, it's broken. They honored that and I was happy. However, as my boyfriend and I were building this thing, *note i highly recommend at  least two people* we realized that there are missing pieces. So then I call amazon again, after a hour of being transferred like three times, I was able to get a brand new treadmill for the same discounted price. Especially since it took HOURS to put this thing together.Like others as well, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR IFIT! Press the blue button for about 30 seconds and it'll turn on. Don't get scammed into the credit card scheme. I'm sure it's great and all but I don't like things being forced on me.Now in regards of the treadmill, it's pretty nice! Granted it took forever to build. Assembly directions are garbage. Google or youtube it, because there's a step at the end that you need to do actually in the beginning. It's like the wire covering sliders that goes over the wires on the sides. You need to do that like in the beginning stages, youtube it you'll see what i mean. The directions are written poorly. The screws sometimes don't even fit, you'll see what im talking about. We used a hammer etc.The treadmill after it was put together, it was great! I did my workout a few times, it's a bit loud but that's normal in my opinion. It's like as loud as going to the gym and using one of their treadmills.  The speakers are a nice touch, ipod is a bit outdated lol. Overall, without the ifit program, it still inclines up to level 10, speed goes up to 10, measures your pulse by the grip, time, calories, and distance. The important stuff, i hope this review helps.Ps. yes the exchange was annoying but it was worth it for me because i'm not paying 900 something (protection plan included) for something broken. Cheers!

",5.0,John,"Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2021","









  
  
    
  First let me start by saying the treadmill is amazing. One of the delivery guys was bringing it in and their first comment was man this is heavy you can tell this isnât a cheap one. Itâs incredibly sturdy and everything works as desired without unnecessary frills. Iâve been on treadmills with fans before they donât do anything :) The delivery guys were fast and polite.Now the negative which has nothing to do with Amazon or the treadmill itself, but the deceptiveness and out right lies that are printed inside of the manuals and the screen when you purchased this treadmill claiming that it literally will not work if you donât activate the iFit subscription. This is not unique to just this treadmill, it is the new wave sweeping exercise equipment. They will outright claim that you have to subscribe to their subscriptions or equipment will not work and it is not true. To be honest Iâm really surprised this is legal. However....The 30 second trick does work! Hold down the blue iFit button for 30 seconds and it will get you out of the screen telling you to activate ifit and your treadmill will immediately start working!!At the end of the day I would recommend this treadmill  and hope that lawmakers stop this immoral  practice praying on people who fall for their lies.

  This is an awesome treadmill! I'm 200 pounds and I can run on it just fine. IFit  is predatory and annoying, but I knew from other reviews to override it and never give my credit card information (it works great without it). The programs and incline are great, and I haven't had any issues so far. It is a bit noisy but if you shut the door it isn't that noticeable. It is heavy to carry up the stairs, so make sure you put it where you want it to stay. Some of the reviews said it was hard to lift it to fold up, but I don't think it's heavy (I'm an out of shape 200 pound woman). It took my husband a few hours to put together. The cup holders are super huge which I love because I can fit a large mason jar of water in them. Thanks!

  So far I love it. It's the perfect price. Some people donât want to get this because it says you have to subscribe to the iFit program. I never had to! I learned that if you hold the iFit button for about 20-30 sec it skip the whole having to sign up to it. Doing that I didnât have to worry about having to call to cancel the subscription. It comes with 4 programs that have 5 different levels in each-20 in total! They are not all that easy I have to stop on one about 15 min into it because I couldnât keep up! I know Iâm not that in shape but Iâm not that out of shape either. Iâm 5â7ââ 125 lbs and have had 4 kids. The hear rate monitor works- at first I thought it didnât because it would start to blink like it was going to give me my results and then it would disappear. I learned that even if it did that you have to keep your hands there and your heart rate WILL appear-you just have to be patient.The incline works great! Havenât had a problem. Same with the speed.Unless you know for a fact that you can run/sprint more than 10 mph then you can consider getting a faster treadmill. I could barely keep up going 6 mph for a little bit. Cup holders are great. It does have a plug for an auxiliary cable if you want to use your phone with its speakers. The side rails(not sure if thats what theyâre called) help when I lose my balance to get back on track. It also has the emergency stop that you can clip on to yourself in case you fall.It wonât fit through all door frames so measure! It helps if you know what room your going to want it in so it gets assembled in that one room. It not too noisy- I donât think Iâve ever used a treadmill that was dead silent before. It doesnât have a fan but even the ones that do are not even that strong! I think the treadmills that have them are just to make it feel more like your outside rather than to cool you off. Just grab a fan you already have at home and done! Overall I believe I made a great purchase!

    Most Frustrating Purchase of My Life
  
",1.0,S. Jacob,"Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  After a lot of research I purchased this treadmill for my birthday. I immediately loved it! The I-fit software is fantastic and I really enjoyed just being able to run or walk without having to think about adjusting my speed. It really improved my fitness. That is, until one day I was running on it and my treadmill started going crazy. The belt started moving EXTREMELY fast out of nowhere. Fortunately I was able to react quickly and pull the key but I could have been terribly injured if I hadn't done so. After that each time I would turn on my treadmill it would do the same thing. To make a long story short I bought this treadmill in January of 2020. It stopped working March 2020 (yes just 2 months later) and guess what? It is now September and I still do not have a working treadmill. Nordictrack cannot get me the part needed even though its still under warranty. They keep blaming COVID even though it has been months. I am very understanding of the issues caused by COVID especially with shipping from overseas. But this is beyond ridiculous. Their customer service has been terrible. Meanwhile I'm still paying for in I-fit membership I can't use. I wish I could say this was a one off situation but if you google issues with the control board, you will be shocked to find this has happened to many people. I highly caution anyone who is considering buying this product. It is a shame because it could be such a great product if it actually worked.

  Â Manufacturing defect:I was very excited to have received T Series 6.5S Treadmill. However, upon assembly I observed the main frame of the treadmill is crooked and is very wiggly when on the floor and impossible to fold up because the main body (that houses the belt) gets stuck at the right arm because the frame is tilted to the right. That part came pre-assembled. Check the picture and the video. This is an obvious manufacturing defect.NordicTrack Customer Service:The package included a big signed "" Please do not return to store"" and it has an email address. NOT A PHONE NUMBER.I sent an email with the problem, with pictures.3 days passed. no responseThen I visited their website and I found chat support.  Waiting for 30+ min in queue. the agent responded. explain the issue again.The agent said this is fixable. Please don't return. But you need to register the product first.I registered the product.the day after received email asking me for my info to verify me. I replied with the info.the day after received another email asking me to confirm all screws are in place and tighter.I replied right away that screws that I was asked to install are in the right place and the highlighted AGAIN that the crooked piece came pre-assembled.3 days passed and no response.I believe Nordic Track customer service are testing my patience.I will update this post with my experience and see if the issue is resolved or I had to contact Amazon to get someone to take it back.

  This is certainly a very impressive machine, and help you with many functions.  I am surprised that such a powerful machine, with its strong name, takes away services, instead of adding it.1. The machine will not start working unless you join the IFIT, including a charge card, something I don't like to give so easy.  So I press the join bottom holding it for a while, and this lets you overpass their request, but they don't tell you that.2. Most machines have an automatic coll down button, this one doesn't have it.3. Most machines have at least 10 pre-program exercises for 30 minutes each on the different levels, this doesn't have it anymore, unless you join them and pay a Monthly fee.Overall is a good machine for basic people like me, if you expect a high level of functions, you better pay the Monthly fee.

  Assembly was a little tricky and really takes two people.  One needs to hold certain parts while the other tightens screws.  However my 17 year old grandson was able to assemble in about 30 minutes.  It is very sturdy and did require two people to move.  It weighs over 200 pounds.  As it is in the basement, I have no need to fold it up so I can't review that option.  I like the solidness of it compared to some less expensive models.  It has a bluetooth connection and can be used for live Interactiveâ¢ Training with IFIT.  This is free for a month and a monthly subscription after that. I have not used this option, but it is a nice feature for some.  The only complaint I have is I wish the bed was a little longer, when on incline my foot keeps hitting the motor cover and the hand rails could be longer also.  In order to use the handrails, I also tend to step on the motor cover.Overall, it is a great  treadmill and I am very happy with it.  I use it almost every day as does my husband.

  I purchased this after finally realizing my days at the gym were over. I researched treadmills FOR WEEKS. Finally, after asking for recommendations on social media, a friend gave this treadmill such an amazing review, I purchased this immediately after her response.It arrived as scheduled. It was bigger than I thought but thatâs not a bad thing. Iâm 220 pounds so I wanted something secure. Note: It takes two people to put this together quickly. And, it takes some muscle getting it in the house.It took us a couple days putting this together because we didnât follow the instructions. ð¤¦ð¾ââï¸Once we got it together, we found a faulty wire. I called support and they have a great method to provide service. I downloaded an app and the app allowed her to see my treadmill. It was like FaceTime via an app. She saw the problem and sent me what was needed.After getting everything together, my free iFit membership was about to expire. I sent them an email and asked for a couple weeks to try it out. Without hesitation, they gave me a new 30 days!Iâve used this treadmill a lot. I really like it. It has two huge cup holders and a ledge to hold a book, tablet, or phone. I learned how to silence the beeps so itâs not waking my husband up in the morning.Itâs easy to fold and unfold.Pros: It does what it says. Itâs sturdy. Itâs high quality.Cons: Itâs not as quiet as I would like. It may be due to me putting it together but there is a sound of the belt when using.

  This is a nice solid treadmill.  All pieces were securely wrapped in the box, which came undamaged.  We are slow but it took about 2 hours to put together.  Time went fast.  This thing is heavy, which is good when using it, but not so great for moving it around.  We like it enough to deal with that though.The iFit... I know you donât have to subscribe but we took them up on the free trial.  We didnât have to put in a credit card number.  That was optional.I thought iFit was going to be glitchy and gimmicky but itâs really great for keeping you company while walking and also keeping your mind off of how long youâve been on the treadmill.  For walking, there are guided tours of so many places around the world and you learn so much.  The treadmill automatically adjusts the incline and speed so you get to keep up with the tour guide and get a workout at the same time.  Itâs very smooth and not choppy when changing the incline and speed to match terrain.You can use this treadmill manually without IFit, but it really is worth trying out if you have some sort of tablet.  We are using a 2nd generation iPad and it works great.The belt is longer than our old treadmill, and it is wide enough that I dont scrape the sides constantly.  I feel like we got a decent bargain getting this treadmill.ââ updateââ-We have had this treadmill a while now And it still runs great.  Still loving IFit.  Even my husband is using it.  Nordic track customer service has been good too.  I had to call because it was squeaking and they sent a free bottle of lubricant for it.  It takes a while to get them on the phone but once you do they are very helpful.  Love the new treadmill.

  After reading numerous reviews, I decided to take a chance on a treadmill I was not able to actually test out in person...happy so far, except for the weird stuff required for activation, signing up with IFIT-which I have no interest in continuing with. The good thing, is, I did not have to give IFIT my credit card info. I was really amazed at the quality of the treadmill and how big it actually was. My husband put it together in about an hour.

  So I am giving this product 4 stars but only because they truly try to force IFIT on people. You donât have to register the IFIT to make it work or provide your credit card. Simply hold down the IFIT button for about 15 to 20 seconds and it will unlock the treadmill. You also only have to do this one time. Nordic Track doesnât advise customers of this either. So that to me sounds a very deceptive practice.As far as putting it together, you do require two people as youâll need to have someone hold up the panel while being installed. The tools needed were socket wrench set, a Philips screwdriver, along with the tool they provided. My 20-year-old son put this together and without any issue. So it is not hard to put together and save yourself on the installation fee.The machine works perfectly for my needs. I also paid the $19 to have it delivered to the floor I plan to have it installed and it is a great idea as the machine is heavy. I also purchased a mat for the treadmill to sit on to keep it from damaging the carpeting. Raising and bringing down the belt for storage is very easy as well.

  Literally would purchase 4266284 times over. I despise running with a passion and I am now running between 10-20 miles a week which is unheard of for me. I love the recorded sessions, and I am absolutely in love with the fact that the instructor controls the incline and speed. I think over time I will go ahead and purchase the more expensive version but at this time this is absolutely perfect for my beginner/intermediate  running level. Iâm slowly climbing the classes intensities and am beyond happy. A piece arrive broken and the customer service was prompt and sent me a new piece immediately!

  It's been a couple of months since we bought this NordicTrack treadmill. Our overall experience has been good, my wife uses it to walk and I use it to run, it is a solid and stable structure.The model we bought does not have any fancy screens or functions but it works great if you are looking for a very functional treadmill to walk or run.

  My previous treadmill stopped working. It was 8 years old. So I decided to replace and started my search. After a few weeks, I decided on this model. This treadmill is awesome. Great value. I have only had a couple days. But I am very satisfied so far. 1st of all, the delivery was on time. The delivery folks were awesome. They had me all setup in ~ 45 minutes. Secondly, I did read all the reviews before I decided to purchase. Was concerned about the ifit and having to register in order for the treadmill to work. It can be bypassed without registering! There was a review on how. So no worry there. Thirdly, after 2 days and 2 runs so far, I can say this treadmill feels like I am running on a treadmill at the gym. Very happy with purchase. Will check in again in about 1 month to provide an update.

    Worth it, but some considerations to note
  
",4.0,Rich Gold,"Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  After 1 week, overall I like this treadmill for running and walking and think it was worth the money.The biggest potential issue I see is the 2.6 hp motor which is on the small side if you plan on running. Time will tell how this holds up to regular light running. So far it is smooth and works flawlessly. The i-fit thing is a bit of a joke, but as long as you know how to bypass when you 1st plug it in (hold down the i-fit button), it doesnât bother you after that. I do find it annoying that the manual does NOT tell you how to do that.Dislikes:- At a slower walk, the motor does not run smoothly, it has slight jerks twice a second. Itâs a bit distracting and doesnât feel great, but Iâm getting used to it. At faster speeds I donât notice it- Cannot resume your walk/run after stopping for 1 min. It still shows the details for your recent run/walk for about 5 min, but if you attempt to resume, it just gives an annoying quadruple beep. This is really annoying if you have to stop for a minute, you have to start over. Also the backlit display stays on indefinitely unless you pull out the magnet, which is not a big deal.- Bluetooth capable but only works with i-fit app and some heart monitors. This renders the speakers in it worthless unless you want to plug in an ancient Â¼â jack (if your device even has one). I tried this and found the speaker in my phone to be vastly better.Likes:- Number buttons allow  you to easily dial in the incline and speed without holding down the up/down buttons- Assembly was fairly easy, but there are a couple things that require 2 people- Pretty stable even when running. It has a little bit of wobble when running, but for the price itâs great. I run at  6-7 mph and the motor seems to handle it just fine

  My initial review here.  Will update after additional usage:This is a solid mid-range home use treadmill.  As someone who has only every used professional grade ones at the gym, I was a bit afraid I'd see a big step down.  I don't.  The treadmill does a good job maintaining consistent speeds and is rated to up to 300 lbs (I weight about 165).  The track bed is amply sized for my 6ft height yet folds up conveniently.  NB, it is still big even when folded up.  There are a bunch of preprogrammed workouts but I have no intention to ever use these nor will I pay for IFIT.  The controls are intuitive, but I do have a few gripes.  I wish it listed pace not just speed.  I wish you could see distance and time at the same time, but they alternate back and forth.  I also wish the speakers were a bit louder.  Some have complained that the treadmill is loud, but it is no louder than any I have ever used in the gym.  The acoustics of a small room might perhaps make it seem loud.Delivery was on time and they brought it right inside.  It is heavy so make sure they do.  Assembly was a mix bag.  Scheduling and rescheduling was a pain.  When they did come, the gentleman was nice and efficient but he made a few mistakes while assembling.  I fixed these but how do I know there aren't more.  For the discount price of $15 not a bad deal, but I might be really annoyed at $80.So far I am pleased with this purchase.

  WARNING!! If you are using this on a second floor then pay the extra cash for 2nd floor delivery!! I did and I'm glad I did it, this thing is well packed in a wood/cardboard create it's huge!! Delivery guys were EXTREMELY fast and professional. As for treadmill I love it, I'm 6'4 and 242 pds it's feels solid when I run.. I do sprints at 9mph on it and its solid as a rock.. My only complaint is the screen is really HD clear, but I wish i could use my iPAD screen to watch the ifit videos on it instead, next time I'll buy the larger screen.  the create your own maps feature sucks really bad, it's a joke!! BUT the ifit training videos well make up for it!! They really are something else.. The only reason I dont give 5 stars is because I cannot use ipad to watch ifit video on it.. You can stream sound to treadmill speaker for music but I have a Google home speaker next to it with a Bose Bluetooth speaker so I have my spotify playlists..  Aside from me crying about that lol It is a well built fast treadmill.. AND because of this treadmill (and diet) my Cholesterol dropped 50 points!!!!!!!!!!

    Works well, even with antiquated tablet-style screen
  
",4.0,MP,"Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  So, weâve put  one to 200 hours on this treadmill and like it a lot.1. Install: we paid extra for install (it was on-sale), so I couldnât be blamed for any warranty claims we might have in the future. The install did not take long, but, in the end, the installer handed me the remaining lock-washers, which was...all of them, still seals against the cardboard. I asked the installer if he needed these, whether he used all of the parts required in the instructions, and he said, âyesâ. He seemed like a nice fellow, so I guess Iâll just have to trust him. Nothing has come loose so far!2. Touch-screen: This thing appears to be as low-budget as you can get. Itâs sloooow to respond to touch inputs and transitions slowly between screens. Iâm not sure if itâs related, but animations for guided workouts run at around 1 FPS. That might just be to save on space, not the screen, but I thought it was worth mentioning.3. Workout: flawless. The speeds seem accurate, the buttons are easy to push for speed and elevation changes, and the failsafe magnetic dongle is very easy to knock off in case of emergency. Iâve only had to do this once, when my daughter decided to climb onto the treadmill while I was running. The track stopped nearly instantaneously. I donât attach it to myself while running, but itâs within easy slapping distance to swipe off and kill the mill.4. Outlook: with the wonky touchscreen I opted to buy the 3 year maintenance and extended warranty. This will cover annual maintenance (probably just a check of tightness of the belt and other visual checks); however, more importantly, it will cover any issues in this period. Iâm hopeful that if something like the screen were to go bad, it will do so within this period.Iâll update this review with any issues, should we experience any.

    Disabling iFit and needing a rubber mat

  We're happy with the treadmill overall. It's the cheapest one, by a well known brand, that can have the elevation raised and lowered without getting off the treadmill and doing it manually.Like a lot of people, I didn't want to be forced into buying iFit or even answering the personal questions they ask in order to get a free trial. I went to the iFit website only after I was unable to bypass iFit on the treadmill.Note that in order to bypass iFit on the treadmill (using the 30 second hold down method of the iFit button)  you must have the safety key in place. I did not at first and it wasn't obvious because the treadmill powers-up the first time regardless of the safety key being in place.I'm also happy that I put the treadmill on a rubber mat even though I have it on carpet. Rust came out of the treadmill during assembly and would have potentially ruined my carpet, something to think about.

    Inadequate assembly instructions and support
  
",1.0,Susan Blumenthal,"Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2021","









  
  
    
  Step 10  page 13 written instructions describe connecting 2 sets of wires M to N, and O to 81, but there are 3 set of wires. The 3rd set is in the middle on console assembly and console base assembly. There is no mention of the 3rd set of wires. On the phone with the Icon Fitness for 2 hours asking what to do with the extra set of wires on the console assembly and console assembly base. My husband downloaded the Visual Support app as recommended to assist ICON in trouble shooting.  Patrick and his supervisor  recommend to keep going with the assembly and worry about the extra set of wires later if treadmill does not work.  This is not the answer we were hoping for. Icon Fitness team leader Savannah reached out by email and phone. She says a technician will call in 7-10 business days to tell us what the extra wires are for.  We buy a treadmill from Amazon with a 3 year extended warranty but without an expert to answer a basic question . Icon said they will send a technician out to assemble for $165. My husband is very handy.  If Icon service support  knew their Nordic Track treadmill  product they would be able to explain this step to my husband over the phone. The written instructions are incomplete. If anyone has experienced with this problem please reach out to Amazon with the solution.

  Loosing weight is not easy. Using this Nordic Track foldable treadmill makes it easier. I had the Amazon delivery with included assembly and Iâm so glad I did. The only thing I have to do is push the metal bar with my foot and down it comes into its regular position. Perfect for at home use and great to get in shape while watching tv. I like that this has several options for speed and incline and even built in work out modes for high intensity interval training if youâre into that! I appreciate the design and ease of use from this machine. You will not be disappointed by the price point or functionality of Nordic track. You get what you pay for and I believe this treadmill has it all!

You can adjust manually, but once you do, it will no longer adjust with the trainer if you do so.I had to manually set the belt! Its a good thing i knew what was going on from past treadmills, since 3d setup instructions didnt make mention of making sure belt doesnt walk left or right. Turned mine on at 1mph, and belt ran off to right almost immediately. Thankfully i caught the issue before the track was damaged. Hole for balancing the track wasnt exactly lined up, so took some flopping around to get the hex tool into the set screw.

  I've had this treadmill for a couple months now, and have really enjoyed it.  First, don't fall into the iFit trap if you don't want/need it.  Just hold down the iFit button at first start-up, after 15 seconds it will proceed to normal operation and you'll never had to do that again.  Being 6'4"", it works great for my power walking, occasional jogging needs.  The deck may be a tad cramped for long-legged running, but that's not my thing.  Operation is smooth and quiet (so far), and it easily folds up vertical to be out of the way.  Features are fine, decent variety of programs and settings.  All in all, for the price, features and fit for my needs, it's been a great treadmill.

  We purchased this treadmill when the fires took hold in California in 2020. All this telecommuting and now our exercise being taken away? We were going nuts.

  I just received this treadmill yesterday. I've only run on it once. I have some pros and cons:Pros:It's very sturdy,not super loud,feels solid wile walking and running (I only got up to 5.4 MPH),the display is a good size and easy to read.Cons: I was VERY disappointed when I realized that while the ad says it is totally iFit compatible (but does clearly state that you have to buy a subscription), but it is only compatible when you buy a separate module for it (I got on an online chat with iFit and they told me the module is $180). I won't be doing that.I'm also not happy with the ""settings"" feature. The settings are: Demo on or off, and English vs. Metric for distance - that's it. It seems there is no way to set your weight - so the calories burned feature is totally useless. I'd also like the ability to see Minutes per Mile instead of Miles per Hour, but there seems to be no way to change that either.The free scheduled shipping was a bit of a disappointment as well. It did come exactly when they said it would, but this thing is a huge box that weighs almost 200 lbs. There was only one delivery man on the truck and it had to come it up a full flight of stairs. I was very lucky that my husband and another man were here at the time and it took all three of them to get it up the stairs. If they hadn't been here it would have been sitting on the porch. Even the paperwork that came with it said ""2 man delivery"".I will update this review later if I find any ways to improve the settings feature.My overall impression is that is a very sturdy basic treadmill. If you want to simply turn it on and walk and/or run and don't care about tracking anything other than your MPH, distance, and time on the machine; it's fine. I paid $599.99 plus tax (free shipping) so it's not a terrible value. I will say that I feel the ad description regarding the iFit is deceptive.

  This is a great quality, sturdy, treadmill, with the features we wanted: up to 10% incline, up to 10 mph, foldable & moveable, and 200 lbs, not as heavy as the commercial model so maybe the two of us could move it if needed. The delivery guys unloaded it in the room of our choice on our waiting floor mat. My husband (mostly) and I had it together in a couple of hours. If you are more mechanical than we are, maybe not that long for you. We deducted a star from 5 because of the Ifit scam!

  I've only had the treadmill for one day and as far as the product itself and its functionality goes, it seems fine so far. The biggest issue and reason for my 3-star rating is that the item description on Amazon was incorrect. The description incorrectly states that the speed is adjustable up to 12 mph, but in fact it only goes up to 10 mph. That may not be big deal for some but I was specifically looking for a treadmill with a max speed above 10 mph for those high intensity workouts. I'm in the process of returning it and replacing it with a different model (NordicTrack C990) which costs about $300 more. As I said, the product itself seems pretty good but just be aware that the true max speed is 10 mph not 12 mph.

  This treadmill is AMAZING for the price. We wanted to get a cheap treadmill without spending thousands. We wanted a very basic treadmill, with incline, that was narrow for our bedroom. We specifically only wanted a treadmill for walking on incline or power walking. This one gets the job done. We paid for amazon to deliver and set it up. They were in and out in under and hour! IFit offers a one month free trial, but after that IFit is not required for use of the treadmill and you could cancel IFit. I tried out IFit and it was great, but the only downside is that the treadmill does not offer decline. IFit has many walks with decline so while they talk about how nice your decline break must be, your just walking on flat surface. Not a big deal, and nothing to take a star away - just donât use the IFit if you donât like it. The treadmill itself is pretty quiet, good quality. This one is better for walking or power walking. You could run, however the treadmill does tend to bounce side to side a little with heavy feet and quick movement. I would recommend a different treadmill if youâre main purpose will be running. But if you want a treadmill for the same reasons as us, buy it! You wonât regret it!

  I had my original NordicTrack for 12 years and was finally ready to upgrade. I used my previous one regularly, so it was worth it to buy a good one in the mid-price range.  I love this one!  My husband and 18 year old son assembled it in about two hours and set up with iFit was relatively seamless.  I initially figured I would just use the trainers every so often, but I am now hooked on the various training series.  I just recently climbed Mount Kilimanjaro w/ Jake Norton and today walk/jogged up to Germany's Neuschwanstein Castle w/ Casey Gilbert (which was fun because I have actually been to the castle in real life).  I can't imagine walking on my treadmill without the videos now.  However, it's fully equipped to operate either way. I can do manual runs/jogs and follow a regular track, as well as follow an iFit trainer. The belt is smooth and I love that it saves my workouts and charts my progress.  I bought a portable fan (which I desperately need because I'm in Florida), and it gives me ample space for my phone, water bottles, etc. It's sturdy and the handrails are well situated.  I actually love getting on it every morning.  I've been using it daily for over a month and so far so good!

  Arrived on time and in good shape.  Took two hours, two guys with experience and knowledge to put it together.  Did not work immediately.  Wanted me to do the I Fit registration.  Called in to NordicTrack... they were immediately helpful, less than 1 min call.  Simply hold the sync button down and it reverts to a traditional no frills treadmill.  It is nice.  It is light weight.  That can be good or bad depending on size of person and how many persons will be on and off of it.  I want it for only walking.  Was told this would do the job.  I'm sure it will do running but that was not my purpose.  I am 70.  I do know a little about fitness equipment and I never recommend treadmills for the bulk of your work out.  It is hard on your back and your knees.  Sometimes weather does not allow that but down here in Texas, outside is best for walking/running, but weights and classes are best for our age group.  Seems to be a good machine.  It is best suited for someone at average height  --- 5'4'' to 5'10"".  I think if a stabilization bar were added between the uprights, it would really make it an excellent medium machine.  It is just right for the price.

  I bought this treadmill about a month ago and while I was lucky that the installation wasn't too bad, I didn't have horrible problems like other people mentioned, this stuff is heavy... You will need two people. There is a step where you have to hold the belt in an upright position and attach this bit at the bottom of the machine, it's unsafe to do alone.There are a few things they don't tell you you're going to need.- wrenches, the instructions say an adjustable wrench, but there are a few places where an adjustable just wouldn't fit. I think I used 5/16 for those spots.-Phillips screwdriver, most people probably have this at home.- surge suppressor, has to match their ratings. You can look on their manual for that. Amazon customer services was helpful in finding one that worked.I had one issue with the motor hood arriving cracked in several places, not due to any kind of shipping damage. I had to register my treadmill with Nordic track but then they replaced the part. (although the little connectors I had to pry off the old hood to install the new undamaged hood because they didn't send me any hardware... But it works)As for use, it's quiet so far. My walking on it sounds louder than the treadmill, to me. It's easy to fold up, though I don't unless I'm cleaning. I've had it trip the breaker when I tried going directly to 3mph from 0mph, but I also tested it to 7mph with no problems, I had nothing else plugged in and I didn't try to go past 7mph. I'm not in great shape, I'm pushing it at 3mph right now ð.I took off a star for the ifit stuff, it's annoying but easy to get past. Just press the blue ifit button until your screen changes to show the regular display. (Time/distance/calories/etc) it should say LAP 01, if it's like mine.

  The treadmill seems to be working well for my purposes.  I like to jog at a relatively slow pace and add the incline.  I really love the fold up/down feature.  It seems to be designed well and operates on a piston.  As other have noted the company gives the impression that you MUST sign up for their program which is not true.  I didn't appreciate all the warnings in the packaging but I was aware of the workaround from the Amazon Reviews.  Also, the treadmill delivered with my original order was damaged and the end shipper would not accept it.  I have to thank Amazon from scrambling and getting me the replacement in time for Christmas.

    Terrible customer support; does not honor warranty
  
",1.0,JS,"Reviewed in the United States December 19, 2018","









  
  
    
  This is a very sturdy, robust treadmill. The belt moves smoothly, with consistent speed. Controls are responsive. I cannot attest to long-term reliability, as I have had the product for 1 day only .. however, should I experience any major problems, I would be very concerned with how customer service would handle them and potentially apply warranty .. see notes below. Amazon delivery was excellent.Assembly was surprisingly straightforward. I did it by myself in 3 hours, with some occasional help from my wife (eg, hold the console for a moment). You will need some basic tools. The assembly instructions are good, but a couple videos on youtube were helpful. The package is  heavy (200+ lbs), so I recommend to spend the extra $20 for the delivery guys to place it in the room of your choice. For clarity, no heavy parts have to be moved to assemble the treadmill.The user interface looks more like from the 20th century .. eg, iPod connection or no bluetooth connectivity .. but not a big deal.The built-in HR monitor using handgrips is useless at best. The values jump completely randomly around in a 65-170 BPM range, in about 5 second intervals. For example, something like this: 110-168-135-70-126 .. all this during one minute, while consistently walking and steadily holding the grips. My true HR was about 85. But more importantly, this brings me to my earlier point about customer service.So I called Nordictrack to let them know about the heart rate monitor problem. The troubleshooting process went as follows: (1) They told me that I should not move to get accurate readings .. ironic, given that we are dealing with a treadmill .. so I tried to stand on the side rails, without any movement .. no effect on the erratic HR readings; (2) My hands cannot be wet .. hmm, isn't the treadmill meant for exercise?  .. anyways, wiped off my hands, problem not solved; (3) Then the rep said that it is the light dimmer switch that is interfering with the monitor .. turned off lights, no effect .. the rep says it's the dimmer regardless whether lights are on or off .. so I shut down the entire circuit breaker for the dimmer & lights, to no avail. After that the rep says that the HR monitor is not supposed to give accurate readings anyways, and there is nothing they can do about that. Upon a warranty question I posed, they said that warranty did not apply to problems that cannot be fixed. They would not replace the console. They would not dispatch a service rep to fix the problem. If I want, I can return the unit to Amazon. Nordictrack is not responsible.Frankly, I don't really care that much about the HR monitor. The only reason I am sharing this entire customer service episode is to provide feedback on that part of Nordictrack's business. What left a sour taste in my mouth was two-fold: A) Nordictrack tried to blame the customer for a problem they evidently knew about, and B) their absurd claim that warranty did not apply to problems that cannot be fixed. I can only hope I won't have to deal with customer service with a bigger problem.Bottom line: sturdy build, smooth run, out-of-date user interface, HR monitor useless, terrible customer service, warranty not honored. Wishing good luck to anyone who encounters problems with the product and would like to apply warranty.

  When I opened the box, I noticed that there were shards of black plastic everywhere. After I put the thing together, I realized that all the plastic pieces were once a part of the bottom right foot of the machine. It's not a structural piece, just a cosmetic piece that surrounds the rubber foot. I tried calling, but that was no luck. Their livechat service was also not helpful, since it's not even a real person, nor does it let you connect with one. I emailed NordicTrack customer support regarding the issue, and I included the part number as well as pictures. After a week or so they finally responded with some generic questions, so I answered. Another week or so goes by and they respond with some more questions, that are not even relevant anymore, I respond. It has now been 3 months and I haven't heard back from them.I also purchased the 3 year maintenance plan. The way that is has been going, I'm pretty sure that was a waste too.Overall the treadmill is good. It goes to 10 incline and can speed up to 10mph. There are minor creaks that I hear, but other than that, it's all working good.UPDATE: Finally got in touch with Icon Fitness, and they told me the warranty is voided because the treadmill is in the garage. Even though I clearly mentioned to them that the damage had occurred during shipping. They were persistent in saying that since it is in the garage, it must have been damaged by the garage door or a vehicle. Except that the garage is now turned into a home gym, and we do not park cars in there... If you have any issues with your equipment, DO NOT TELL THEM IT IS IN THE GARAGE! Move it back inside the house before you contact them and send images.

    Great treadmill for at home workouts
  
",5.0,Leann Michel,"Reviewed in the United States November 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  TL;DR If you are looking for a affordable basic treadmill that can do moderate speed and incline this is the treadmill for you. (Hold down ifit button for 30 secs to skip activating ifit membership and use basic functions on treadmill).Iâve been really happy with this treadmill, bout it a little over a month ago. It was relatively easy to assemble (I was able to assemble it myself, and Iâm a 5â1â female) â the instructions were a bit difficult to understand but I was able to find YouTube videos which were really helpful. The belt was very off to one side so I did have to adjust quite a bit.In terms of working out, itâs great my runs are typically 30-45 mins and I run 3-4 days a week (did 6 days the first couple weeks with no issues). With moderate speed and lower incline so this treadmill has been perfect for me. I like that as I make improvements to my speed and endurance I have room to increase both speed and incline. From what I can tell it uses low energy as well, have not seen a large impact to my power bill at allâ to be fair I also donât keep it plugged in when not in use.In terms of space it takes up very little space I have it in my living room near my patio and there is plenty of room to pass by without bumping into it. I normally keep the deck down because otherwise it feels like it cuts the room, but I like that itâs easy to fold when I need to vacuum or if I want to do a circuit and need more space. Deck is also cat approved.I know a lot of reviews complain about the ifit registration, I did research beforehand and knew that I wouldnât need to activate the membership to use the machine (just hold down the ifit button for 30 secs). I canât speak about the work out programs or HR monitor because I donât use either feature, I prefer to set manual workouts and I wear a fitbit versa 2 when working out that tracks my HR and workout automatically for me. Overall this has been a very versatile machine Iâm personally happy with.

    Using it for rehab. We like it. Step 8 is Outrageous.
  
",5.0,Michael Simpson,"Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  Using it for rehab. We like it.I have been in gyms pretty much all my lifeâback to the days of Jack Lalaine.  This treadmill is an impressive midrange machine. No question, itâs not gym strength, but for home use it appears to be an outstanding choice. Couple of points. One, get the install . Unless you can tap a hole, you need to get someone to put it together. Delivery was very good as was the packaging. We ran into trouble on step 8 which involves attaching the crossbar. Short story, I had to retap the holes with a 10/24 tap and buy 10/24 1-1/4 screws. Also, the replacement grounding screw was unusable so we used the shipping screw. Anyway, unless you are comfortable taping a hole get somebody to assemble it. Customer service (Donna) was a pleasure to work with and did what was possible with step 8, but we couldnât fix it without retaping the holes. Search the reviews for step 8 for all the horror stories. This machine has all the features one would expect in a treadmill. You can get better features (larger screen, industrial strength, etc), but you have to âopen the vaultâ for those. Much was made about iFit, but I feel itâs irrelevant to the machine itself. One last thing, the machine goes to 10 miles an hour and thatâs nice, but since we brought it for rehab it is more importantly to me is that it goes down to .5 miles an hour. Nice machine weâll see if it lasts.More on step 8. Like many others, we got stuck at step 8  (search step 8 in comments). The problem, I believe is that the screws do not match the tap used for the holes. For one, they are wood screws. Anyway after the usual unsuccessful calls, we re-tapped the holes with a 10/24 tap and brought the corresponding 10/24 by 1.25 inch machine screws. It's fixed. I do not recommend this to anyone, it's just what we did to get to step 9. Photos attached. PS. we watched the YOUTUBE video on assembly, and wow! nothing on step 8 . Also, the grounding screw was uninstallable and we just used the original.

  Overall, the treadmill is great. I was able to easily skip iFit as I certainly do not need it. 20 on-board programs are more than enough for me at this stage. Ih fact I currently use only the Manual mode that provides me the setting flexibility I need.However, I initially encountered a couple of issues.1. When I assembled the  treadmill  the incline motor did not function. I contacted the Customer Service and was pleasantly surprised.  The Customer Service is great. It is the main reason I give 5 star overall. First they sent me the new motor. When I got difficulties during the motor installation then  they also sent a technician that made it to work great.2. The box as delivered is very heavy. So lifting the treadmill  to install it on the 1st or 2nd floor  requires significant efforts. The assembly itself is not very difficult and I did it myself but is still lengthy and occasionally requires a help of another  person.But generally I am happy with the purchase and trying to excise on a daily basis.

  This may be the most expensive piece of junk Iâve ever purchased. Preface that Iâm an engineer, so this isnât my first assembly rodeo.In assembling the treadmill, there are multiple screws you have to take out before assembling it properly. Some of them make sense to keep the parts together during transit, and some are just an unnecessary pain. The best part is that the user manual doesnât even list some of the extra screws! And those ones in particular, when removing, donât properly fit.Loved scratching the metal getting them out so that I could install the ACTUAL screws that belonged from the guidance in the manual.Now letâs talk about the app. Created my account online and then downloaded the app. Tried to use the same login information on the app and it didnât work. Tried sending a link to reset my password and itâs been several hours with zero email. So I went online, logged in, and changed my password to the good ol 12345678 just in case for some reason I couldnât type like a normal human being. STILL didnât work on the app. And their helpline is only available 8-5 MST, so looks like Iâll be calling during my lunch hour to figure this out. Another fun finding - some of the links in the mobile view of the online website are broken.Piece of junk, through and through.

    iFit software is not ready for primetime; so much potential, but we are unhappy
  
",2.0,Michael LeBlanc,"Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  This review is for the NordicTrack T9.5S we purchased in November 2019. We have had other NordicTrack products before and were happy. This time, not so much. Assembly was challenging, but not so bad. No complaints on that front, really. Fit and finish are pretty good. It makes some strange noises now and then, but generally it is pretty solid, and the buttons do as they should.The real problems have been with iFit. This unit has an Android operating system that drives the screen, and all of the basic functionality (even the ability to start walking or running) depends on this. iFit is the app they use for managing your workouts, following coaches/trainers, etc. And when this works, it is VERY nice. I have been walking and running in Portugal, Morocco and Costa Rica so far with three different trainers. The machine automatically increases/decreases its speed and incline based on what the trainer decides in his workout. So as you climb a big hill, they typically slow down your speed and of course do a big increase in the % incline, up to as much as 12% I think (maybe it's 15 - not sure). And the trainers typically do a 15 or 20 session workout plan, one per day, so you can stay in shape, with each session getting progressively harder. It is NordicTrack's answer to what Peloton is doing.Where we're having REAL issues is with the login and user management of the iFit software. Because NordicTrack/iFit are so worried about people using the apps without paying, you can't do much of anything without signing in, and that has been a big problem. My wife's account somehow got replaced with my son's, and we cannot get her back on the machine. And when I logged out of the system for my account, now there is no way to log back in! All it does is tell you all of the great things you can do with the software and offer to sell you an account. You can ADD a user (which fails if the user already exists), but there is no LOGIN button! It's really dumb programming. This has been the theme for iFit in general. They have so much content you can access but the organization is TERRIBLE and DISORGANIZED. NordicTrack should have probably have chosen a different partner than iFit, unless NordicTrack OWNS this brand/company.  And of course they only have live chat and telephone support Monday-Friday 9-5, or something like that. Real people tend to also work out on weekends, and that's when stuff happens and when we need help.I hope they respond to this review and tell us why things will be getting better soon.

  I received my treadmill a week ago Saturday (09/05). Two men brought it. One was holding what looked like a scanner, while to other man did all the work. When taking it off the dollie he tried to push it through the door. It caught on the top door frame. He (alone) adjusted it until he could tip it to clear the door frame. He was obviously worn out and frustrated. As so as it cleared the door he PUSHED it over onto the narrow side. After it slammed onto the floor he shoved it on inside. But wait... There is more....I found the directions and it calls for a special surge protector that I could find at the hardware store. I went to three  popular stores. In one I had three people trying to find one. I looked online. I could find one that meet all of the qualifications. So the box is setting in the entrance hall, the base is in place, and all the parts are setting around it still in the plastic/cardboard. I did not want to put it together until I have what I need, so nobody it temped to use it.The following Tuesday (09/08) I submitted inquiry on the NordicTrack website (I do not use a phone, so could not call). I asked if they could give me the name of a surge protector or if they sell them. Thursday (09/10) I was contacted and told I could get one in a maintenance kit, that they sell and was asked for the model number. I replied the same day. Today (09/14) I am still waiting and everything is still laying around.So I have had this for more than a week. Not only have I not been able to use it, the  return time and warranty time is passing by even though I have not been able to use. Needless to say, this experience has not been a good one. I am considering just returning it and getting one elsewhere. For all I know, this one is not going work anyway since it was dropped to the floor.

  I actually ordered a different treadmill from a different company but it was extremely damaged when it arrived so I ended up online searching for another one and I must say some of the reviews on this treadmill almost changed my mind on getting this one but I took the chance . All the features and the size and everything was exactly what I wanted so I ordered it and crossed my fingers it arrived in better shape then the last one and I was extremely happy to see it arrived perfectly and it's been a great machine so far ..it's sturdy and very well made and I had no problem with exiting out of the ifit , I held the button down for a few seconds and the treadmill was ready for me to use with no problems . Putting it together took awhile but my husband had no issues whatsoever and I was happy about that bc reading some of the reviews some have said they had to try calling Nordictrack for help and were on hold for hrs and that right there almost kept me from purchasing bc if you can't easily get a hold of the company something is wrong somewhere ! But while my husband was putting it together I figured I would test that theory to see if I would be left on hold forever, so I dialed customer service , put it on speaker and went about my business and I kid you NOT I was ON HOLD waiting for customer service to get to my call for a WHOLE 3 HRS AND 42MINS !!!!!!!! That is insane and unacceptable !!! They need to fix that issue and I pray I never have issues like many have to where I ever have to call them again and if that wasn't bad enough after purchasing the treadmill I returned to try and find a review with some helpful tips on putting it together and I wanted to show my husband so I signed on to Amazon and starting looking through the reviews and my husband was like are you sure thats the same one we ordered and I said yes why ? and he said didn't you notice the price drop from just 1 day ago ?! I about lost my lunch when I looked up and saw the price was 300$ cheaper then when I had ordered it the day before !!!! I have shopped on this site for years and have never seen that happen ...I was instantly sick to my stomach !!! 300$ is a huge difference ! My husband was shocked too but he assured me if I contacted Amazon they would more than likely refund the difference since we just bought the damn thing and I was thinking he was right bc I know walmart and other stores do exactly that ...so I contacted Amazon and was told they no longer do that , so ya I was out an extra 300$ for a treadmill I could have waited just hrs later to order and would have gotten it way cheaper... I frankly think that'd pretty sickening BUT the fact the machine is everything I was looking for and has given me zero issues I will be happy with that but I might shop around a lot more next time before ordering from Amazon again ! They are a billion dollar company ...300$ shouldnt be anything to them but their greed has gotten the best of them !

  So far so great!  This treadmill is wonderful!  Quiet, easy to operate, it does exactly what I need it for.Delivery was great, they texted for a delivery window and were on time.  The folks delivering it were super nice and helpful. There was some minor box damage which was noted on the tracking information, but there was no damage to the machine at all.  All the pieces required for assembly were there.  The assembly instructions were very clear and the diagrams were spot on.One note on assembly - I'm a 58 year old female, 5'2"" and weigh about 140 lbs.  This was difficult for me to put together because I didn't have the upper body strength to hold/position/lift several of the pieces.  It definitely is a 2 person job at some points.  If it weren't for the current pandemic, I would have gladly paid for assembly.  As it was I did get it done, but it took me several days because of my own strength limitations.  It was my issue, not NordicTrack's fault by any means.  I look at it like I got a bonus workout just from putting it together!  lolI did not sign up for iFit - I held the button down to bypass it as described in the top comment.  Worked like a charm.  I may sign up for iFit later, but I want to choose to do it, not ""have"" to do it just to try out the machine.The treadmill's display works great, the interface works perfectly and is easy to use.  I did have to set it to ""English"" as opposed to ""Metric"", that was the only change I had to make.I purchased a mat to go under it so I wouldn't risk damaging the floors.Overall this is a fantastic treadmill and I'm looking forward to getting into better shape with it.

  So I bought this a year ago. It was tough putting together, but not too bad. I used it for a few months, then an injury kept me from using it for a couple of months. Then the pandemic hit, and we had to stay home. My inquiry felt a bit better so I was hoping to use the treadmill again. Wouldn't start.I was still under the 1 year warranty, plus I purchased a 3 year warranty. I contacted their support. Automatic reply, no person ever contacted me, though. I tried a few more times. Absolutely nothing! What did I pay for??So, I turned to Twitter. The person in charge of their Twitter responded and tried helping me. It's sad how am SEO person or more reliable for support than a customer support representative...Eventually I had to call in with a number the SEO person helped me with, and I talked to a real person! After discussing the issue and doing video of the treadmill, she sent me a new part for it. It took a long time to ship, and when I got it I had to suddenly be my own treadmill technician and take apart the whole thing!The part didn't work. Same as the old part.I contacted her again and she sent me a different part that took about a month to ship. At this point it's now late July or early August. Seeing how bad the last experience was, and how hard it was, I procrastinated for a few weeks until I finally got it done.Guess what? Part doesn't work.Contacted her again, and she says ""I am not sure on other solutions. I would call back in so that we can see what is going on with the machine.""It's literally the same thing, as before, but fine, I'll call. I ask her where to call... No response.So I'm here, with a broken treadmill, and a 3 year warranty... With no way to use it. I can't exactly get a refund, either... No one coming to fix it, or correctly figure out what is wrong.

If it didn't cost more than 50% of the treadmill's price to return it (between shipping, ""restocking fees"", etc), I would have sent it back already.If your wifi is down, or if it has poor access, this treadmill WILL NOT work. At all. As in, you won't be able to just start a simple run. I'd understand if the iFit features were disabled without internet, but the fact that the treadmill itself can't do the most basic task of letting you run is just ridiculous to me. I asked their support why this strange limitation existed, and was told ""That is the way the machine is designed. You will need a WiFi connection to use both the manual workout feature and the iFit content with your machine.""The second reason I wouldn't recommend it is a smaller, but still persistently annoying issue: you can't turn off ""warmups"". So any time you do start a workout, it's just a bunch of extra and unnecessary taps to end the warmup early and reset your speed.And the last reason I wouldn't recommend this treadmill is the belt/motor dynamic. It's adjustable, but the ""fine point"" is very narrow and you're likely to either end up with the belt slipping regularly or with the motor straining under an overly-tightened belt.Now, there are some good things about this treadmill, and I do want this review to be honest and complete:- The fan is a great addition. On warm days, it's a lifesaver.- If you're putting this on a perfectly level floor, it's surprisingly quiet and stable. If your floor is not perfectly flat and level, do NOT get this treadmill - it doesn't have any leveling features, and we used a bunch of shims and cardboard to fill in the gaps.- It folds up nicely when not in use to reduce the footprint.- It's reasonably simple to put together, but the parts are somewhat poorly machined so don't be surprised if you end up with some gaps.All in all, this could have been a great treadmill. But the issues I listed at the beginning are just too much. Don't buy this.

",5.0,GGM,"Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  COVID has changed my life.  I now work from home and am no longer teaching water aerobics or doing Pilates.  I went from a fairly active lifestyle to sitting and not getting out.  My body has paid the price.  I finally purchased this GREAT treadmill to get me going again and I LOVE it!!!  I just wish I had purchased it sooner!!  I felt better after the first use and continue to feel even better as I continue to use it.  Iâm very grateful I was able to purchase this treadmill as so many in local stores were out of stock - many other people doing the same as me.  I felt like the price was reasonable, too, for such a high quality treadmill - paid $630 (tax included).  I did a lot of research before purchasing and Iâm glad I ordered the NordicTrack T Series 6.5S.  I didnât need all the bells and whistles of the more expensive models - I just turn on my music or catch up on programs I like to watch and Iâm good to go.  I love that it folds up & down easily, too.  It is a cold wet day outside, but no worry, Iâll just hope on my treadmill INSIDE and get a great workout!!  THANK YOU!!!

    Good value treadmill
  
",4.0,Prawtin,"Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've had this for a little over a month now.  I use it at least 5 days out of the week, usually jogging 2-3 miles a day.  I'm a fairly big guy at 220lb 6'2"" and I haven't had a problem at all with the machine not performing as expected.  It does get a little shaky at speeds above 5 but a mat under the treadmill helped out a lot with that.  The heart rate sensors are complete garbage as they do not give an accurate reading, nor are they in a position where a person as tall as I am can grab hold of them while walking without stepping off the front end of the treadmill belt.  So in summary, if you want a machine that can keep up mechanically and do what it's supposed to do to help you get fit, it'll do the job.  If you want frilly stuff like a big screen, flashy buttons and that sort of thing, you need to buck up and pay more for another model.  And finally, just like all the other reviews will tell you, it SUCKS that they try to make you think you must have a subscription to the iFit service to use the machine.  That is a flat out lie!  Dam them for such deviousness!

  Love the options, had to have at least a 7"" inch screen and be sure to sign up for a year of IFit Training because it motivates you to stay on track every day with so many variations and workout with different trainers.  It is heavy and  Fed Ex left it at the door - they are supposed to place the machine where you want it but we didn't know it had been delivered.  Amazon made it right and we hired a couple strong teens to move it.  Then the installer came and it took him a couple hours.  I could not imagine trying to put this together so spend the money for assembly - totally worth it.  I have been using the treadmill every day for 2 weeks and feel stronger with more endurance already.

    Excellent Home Treadmill at a Good Price
  
",4.0,B. Browne,"Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  This treadmill seems to perform as advertised. Packaged it weighs over 200 lbs. and is not easy to move, though once you have it assembled, it can be moved more easily. Getting it upstairs would be another story altogether. Assembly is straightforward but does go easier with two people at some stages (my wife was hiding out at that point). All parts were included, as well as an allen wrench. The so-called ""User's Manual' is not - it is basically an assembly guide. There is very little info about how to use this device, which would be really useful. Previous reviewers are correct - you can bypass the IFit stuff by simply holding down the IFit icon for about 30 seconds and it will start right up. Only challenge is there is no guidance as to what the various programs will do. Be careful here - the belt will move very fast at any speed above 4 - you must be ready to run or be tossed off. Just exercise caution. I have spent several days exploring the various programs and there are a nice variety for interval training, which my doctor recommended. The machine is acceptably quiet. I bought an extended warranty as I plan to keep this think for a good while. Overall, I think I made a good purchase here, as I have decided I will not be going back to the gym anytime soon. Together with a Teeter cross-trainer, I can get most of the benefits that the Y offered.

    Great for Diabetics, lowered my A1C
  
",5.0,Charles J. Hampton-SnowTop Contributor: Photography,"Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  I am writing this review after having the NordicTrack for 3 1/2 months and can say , as of today, that I thoroughly enjoy it and it accomplished for me what I wanted it to, which was to lower my A1C. I have been a type 2 diabetic for about 7 years, but by watching what I eat and exercising have kept my A1C mainly below 6.5. I have never taken any medication for my diabetes and am very thin, but 4 months ago my A1C jumped to 7.2, most likely because I'd been cheating with food and exercising less, especially through the winter. I immediately bought this treadmill instead of turning to drugs and now after 3 1/2 months of daily use, my A1C has dropped to 6.7. My doctor says I don't need drugs unless it stays above 7 so I'm very satisfied that this has worked for me. It does help if you like walking to begin with , but now there is no worry about bad weather and I use it after almost every meal. Music for me is the key to enjoying it and not becoming bored. I do 2 to 3 hours a day total. I do not use any of the preset programs but set and vary the speed and incline myself as I walk. I find it to be fairly quiet and can't hear it at all with earbuds in. It can be assembled by yourself if you use something like a short step ladder as a stand-in for someone holding a section up. Assembly was not easy but once together it works great and I hope it lasts many years.

    Ifit Scam
  
",1.0,William Arsenis,"Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  Beware! In order to get the treadmill to run, you have to register with iFit and then give them your cc information for a free trial after which you will be charged a monthly fee of $15.One reviewer wrote that you can actually activate the machine without registering. Unfortunately, I didn't read his review until after I gave my credit card information and registered.Forcing buyers to buy another product in order for the product they've already PURCHASED merits a one-star review. I will NEVER use iFit and I will cancel my subscription ASAP because of these unethical practices.The treadmill itself seems solid. Installation wasn't the easiest, but the instructions were decent and the parts were well organized.

  I bought this tread to use with the Peloton app and it works perfectly!  Iâve used it for a power walk, a run and 2 tread boot camps.  The 1-10 shortcuts work very well to adjust to each of the instructors ques.  If you hit 2 numbers consecutively, it will jump to that tenth of a mph.  For example, if you hit 7 and then 2, it will jump to 7.2 mph speed.  Also, there are arrows to adjust the speed and incline up and down.  The iPad holder is perfect and a standard iPad doesnât block the 5â LCD screen.  The tread is sturdy and long enough for most strides.  When setting it up, be sure to attach the red emergency stop magnet.  Also, hold on iFit button for 30 seconds to bypass paying for iFit.

    Bait and Switch Product
  
",1.0,J. T.,"Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  The product (T6.5Si) could be a great treadmill, but they neutered it with iFit.  After about 6 months, it won't allow me to continue using without registering. Perhaps its a software update. The iFit app had previously allowed you to use it in manual mode if I clicked on all the small text links to run it manually in iFit.  Now a new screen pops up and it seems I have to register an account (and have wi-fi based internet).  Maybe after registering with iFit I can get manual mode back, but I shouldn't have to!  All the technology is there for a great machine, but I do not want to make an account or pay for iFit and I shouldn't have to!  They should just be honest, say that the company making the treadmill is also the company making the iFit system, and advertise that an account with or without  a subscription is required for the features you would expect.Perhaps I have missed something, but they took a good basic touch activated system and stripped all options to funnel you into using iFit.  Maybe the software will be changed to do this, but I doubt it.Update:  I realized that when I started it a 6:00 am, I had mistakenly hit the larger 'log in' button when I was trying to press the smaller 7 point font that says 'continue without signing in'.  At the log in screen there was no back button.  I had to enter the android operating system and force the app to stop.  When I restarted the app I was able to operate the treadmill using iFit in manual mode.  This only worked because I had earlier learned how to access the operating system.

  Pros:  Works. Can walk, jog, incline, and run. Nice water bottle holders. Keeps track of time, possibly distance, and maybe calories.  For the price and brand, very satisfied.  If the treadmill last 5+ years with belt maintenance and lubrication, will have no complaints.  NordicTrack sells a lubrication kit separately.Cons:  Needed 2 âpeopleâ meaning 2 The Rock Johnsons to build. Took 3 people to build. A challenge to build, took time and effort. It has been a month so far and every week have had to adjust treadmill belt right or left. Easy to fix but then it moves the other way. Folding is very heavy and wonder if mechanism is safe. NordicTrack customer service referred me to You Tube videos on other treadmills to do routine maintenance, but manual is vague and states not to use silicone to lubricate.Not Important:  Oversized console feel like I am at Worfâs Station on Next Generation, heartrate monitors only work 1/10 times, speakers are basic but work. Do not need to fold, nice if needed to move it though.

  I was hesitant with the mixed reviews on reliability and some being broken upon arrival, but we have had great luck so far. It was delivered on time and was easy to set up and everything works great so far. We purchased the 6.5s so it doesn't have a large screen but very easily syncs (a push button) with the ifit app on our ipads (which have large excellent screens) which play awesome videos and control our speed and incline.  It also has a perfect little holder for the ipad. We have really enjoyed this machine and hope it is durable and lasts us a while. We are loving ifit and all of the videos- they have so many from walking tours of places around the world to 10k running training series. We actually both look forward to running on the treadmill!

  Does not work properly and it is all but impossible to get technical assistance from Nordic Track.The treadmill works nice. Love the easy lift and soft close feature for lowering. The problem is the incline does not work. I went thru the calibration steps and it does not even calibrate. Called the tech support line and was on hold for 45 minutes and then the call was disconnected be anyone answered. Then tried online chat. They could not help me with this type of issue. Refer me to another website that only offers to sell you replacement part? What? It is brand new and never been used and you already pushing replacement parts??? Well as you can tell this one was not a good experience for me...  After 3 Weeks, we actually spoke with a person today.  However, we were on hold 35 minutes to get to that person.  She pushed us through several hoops, including an app that allowed her to see what we were doing on our end.  She then determined that it probably could not be resolved and placed us on hold.  After an additional 15 minute the called was terminated from her end.  I guess this is going to have to go back.  Very disappointed and frustrated.

  This treadmill has never worked correctly.  From day 1 the incline function did not work.  I contacted Amazon who passed me to the companies customer service (ICON).  They were great on the first phone call to try and diagnose the problem.  Then they started shipping parts.  Not much substance just a package in the mail with a motherboard or a cord to replace with hard to understand instructions.  I had someone to email back if it did't work and when I did that I randomly received a part a few days later.  I have changed out almost every part and still...nothing.  It does not work.  This is a very very expensive lemon at this point.  I just called Amazon again to assist and they are trying to get the company to help, but they will not do anything as it is outside of the return window.Bottom line - Buyer beware here.  I wouldn't buy this treadmill again.Also, read up on iFit.  It basically requires a subscription to work...that should have been disclosed...it isn't free.  It is one of those monthly subscription services.  There is a work around, but it is not straightforward.

  From the day we received and assembled our treadmill the incline setting did not work.  We immediately submitted a support request online and went back and forth over several months with support until they requested info to have a service technician come out.  Ever since then all communication has ceased even after repeated requests for updates.  Why would support be so responsive until it's time for a service request to come onsite?A few months in the motor started making a squeaking sound and has been getting progressively louder.  We submitted another support ticket, and after going back and forth a couple of times gathering issue details their support disappeared again and stopped responding even after repeated requests for updates.So here we are stuck with a 220lb faulty treadmill with a broken incline and a gradually failing motor, and two support tickets, one of which is almost 5 months old and support has gone silent.Until they get their support act together I would recommend steering clear of this brand.

  So lets start with the bad, the assembly. Getting the packaging off alone kind of sucked. It took forever and getting the deck out of the box was HARD. I had no problems with damage from shipping though so for that I am happy to deal with the unpacking.  I did assemble this beast myself. It would have been a piece of cake if the majority of my assembly time wasn't spent fighting improperly pre-drilled holes. The grounding screw was a nightmare! I tried and tried but couldn't get it to find any threads. I think it was overly powdered coated. I finally forced it through with an assist by the place holder screw (which I could barely get out to begin with). Then on the other side one of the 4 bolts on the base would NOT go through. The O was shaped like a D so no amount of force was going to make that work. Anyway, after all my frustration and struggle to assemble it started right up and runs like a dream. It is wide and comfy, very stable. It is more like a machine I would use in the gym than other home treadmills I have tried. I think the heart rate monitor is way off though. It was 40 - 20 BPM's away in both directions from what my Apple watch said each time I check but I don't really need it so I don't really care. I had no trouble bypassing iFit at all! Thanks for the tip to hold down the button for 20 seconds. It cleared the iFit stuff and it didn't come back even after unplugging the machine for a while.Edited to add photo of the grounding screw that wouldn't fit. It just kept spining and collecting shards of metal. I did eventually get it in there by pushing the place holder screw through first but it took a lot of work and fustration.

Some screws and bolts need a LOT of elbow grease, but it comes together solidly.  It was WELL packaged and not a scratch or scrape.  I think maybe they've improved the packaging since so many were received damaged.Holding down the ifit button bypassed that nonsense just fine.

  Excited about the treadmill at FIRST.  I had paid an experience service to put the treadmill together for me.  I am so glad I did as it took this couple exactly 1 hour to put it together and this what they do, so I am sure if I would have done it myself, it would have took longer.  Paying $99 was well worth it!  The next step, is where it went down hill.  In order to activate your product /warranty,  you have to take a picture in order to photo register within 30 days to extend your warranty by 90 days  My treadmill had the wrong serial number as it kept saying I had a different treadmill then the one that I had purchased.  Trying to get ahold of customer service at Nordic Track is a joke!  Nobody picks up the phone, if you email them, they do not respond.  Maybe that is their intention.  To get you all worked up so you will get on the treadmill to run all your frustrations out?  I have no issues with the machine at all.  You can manually do your own work out or you can use the programs designed by the trainers. The programs are fun with different courses so you do not get bored.  The product itself is made well and sturdy.  I love my treadmill and would recommend this product.  I just hope you never have to call NordicTrack because you will be disappointed.

  I did my homework like I do before all my larger purchases and I was skeptical at first with this treadmill. Not because of the name, but because it has Ifit built in. Many if not most treadmills do today. The problem is out of the box after assembly it tells you an online registration is required before it will even turn on. This is a ploy to get you to sign up for the Ifit program at $15/month so you can use the online features of running to scenery or to work along with others. Hey all I wanted was a treadmill, not a subscription to a service I didn't want. Well it takes a solid 2 hours to setup unless you're a pro installer and you will swear a few times. Holes don't line up, screws won't go in and you'll struggle a bit but unless you pay the $60 setup fee expect that. Mind you this thing is heavy. 206lbs in the box so you'll need help. Got mine set up and works like a charm. Now, the jewel of this review, how to unlock the treadmill without registering! After setup install the red key on the console, then power it up. After you see the ""Registration required before use"" on the screen, hold down the Ifit button for 20-30 seconds. It will then unlock your machine forever. I also like this treadmill because it has a 300lb capacity and with most treadmills having a 220lb limit this one suited me best. It's solid and has a good warranty on the motor and parts. And Nordictrack must get a kickback from Ifit because I hear even installers won't tell you how to unlock the machine without registration and it's certainly not in the manual. They must make millions off Ifit so of course they won't tell you how to disable it.

Only problem I found so far is the quality of the speakers, which are not that loud and the sound quality is not that great. But other than that, this treadmill it's a good buy. One person can assemble this on their own, it will take a few hours and you will need a stool or chair to hold treadmill up while you install the hydraulic latch to make your job easier. Oh and once installed, hold the iFit button for 30sec to skip the whole activation process.

  I purchased the NordicTrack NTL17915 T 6.5 S Treadmill for $599. So far very pleased with it, but there are a few issues to be aware of when ordering and setting it up.I had it delivered to work and used a dolly, a medium size SUV, and then carried it in pieces with my son to an upstairs room where it was set up. The box is about 32""x74""x10"" and weighs 375 lb - not light for two people to move. Even in pieces, the largest, main unit is well over 200 lb and requires a strap (not included) to keep the folding base from opening, to carry. The set-up instructions are sufficient but not IKEA level of hand holding. Also, in addition to the tools listed on the instruction manual, it is useful to have a 9/16"" socket wrench, and based on other reviews and my experience, you will likely need to open up a hole with a ~7/16"" drill bit, which usually requires a drill with the larger, 1/2"" chuck. I used a drill press.I am very impressed with the engineering of this machine. It was designed to be at the upper weight limit of what can be handled in a home. Took me about an hour to assemble, but most of the time spent was reading the instructions ahead to understand how it all comes together and drilling out that one undersized hole. I give an A to the engineering and value, C to manufacturing because it is unforgivable to have an important structural bolt hole too small, B- to the assembly instructions and F to some genius business executive who decided to plaster all over the box and the manual that it cannot be turned on before activating iFit - with your credit card of course. !!! IGNORE ALL THOSE WARNINGS !!! As many other reviewers have pointed out, after it is assembled and powered, you just have to hold down the blue iFit logo on the panel for about 20 sec to get past the initial registration block. Our unit is quiet and so far works great.

  I bought this to work out, mostly walk at home. The quality is excellent and very sturdy. It did take 3 people to drag it in pieces up the stairs to the room it was going into. Take everything out of the box and transport in pieces. The track is very heavy but easier that way. Once together, it was easy to set up and run. I like the larger screen and would not want smaller. Everything works great, but the hand heart rate sensor is poor at best. It only works on the right hand, and is never close to accurate, so I ordered the iFit chest strap heart monitor. That works excellent and usually in the first minute of a workout it is recognized and giving your heart rate. The machine is fairly quiet, though the fan if you use it is a little loud. I love the iFit and its worth every penny, and the first year is free. I am 6â2â, 205 lbs and this takes everything I can throw at it. I wanted to walk, but Iâm now running intervals and working up to a half hour of running with the help of an iFit workout trainer. I am very happy with this. I did purchase a 6 year service because Iâm putting in about 35 min a day 6-7 days a week. So things will wear out. All in all, excellent machine for the price and quality.

    NordicTrack 6.5Si Was the Right Investment For Adding Cardio to My Workout
  
",4.0,Morgan Powers,"Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  After searching for a good price point on a treadmill, on Amazon PRIME day (July 15, 2019), I finally pulled the trigger and purchased a NordicTrack 6.5Si, which I had delivered to my home. I'm an older guy who works in an office and previously could never seem to get enough cardio. Though I've heard stories about how the average treadmill becomes a coat hanger after six months, I was determined to never let this happen to me. I looked at several pre-owned units that were for sale on various classified ad websites and also a number of new units on the major reseller websites. After carefully considering all the collective info, I eventually decided on the NordicTrack 6.5Si as the best value for the money to meet my goals.DeliveryThe unit was delivered on-time and no parts were missing upon receipt. I'm SUPER GLAD I had the unit delivered because there is a small set of cement steps leading to the entrance to my home and the shipping carton was very long (5+ feet) and extremely heavy. Two large men took a fairly long time to negotiate the cement steps/doorway area into my home and were greatly relieved to finally be able to set the unit down once inside my home.AssemblyThough I'm fairly mechanically inclined, it took 9-hours with only a few breaks (far longer than expected) from the time I slit open the carton to the time I tightened the last bolt on the treadmill for use with only a few breaks, so plan your full Saturday or Sunday accordingly. The project wasn't technically difficult, and instructions were clearâjust a significant number of time-consuming steps involved in the assembly process. Also, thereâs a point toward the end of assembly in which YOU WILL DEFINITELY REQUIRE a second person to assist for a few minutes. No human can simultaneously bear the weight of the entire treadmill deck (belt area) while tightening the underneath bolts that are attached to the frame, unless, of course, your arms happen to be five-feet long and you can also bench-press 300-lbs. Trust me, I tried to accomplish this alone for a long time beyond what I can describe and still failed.WorkoutThe next day, though I was still pretty sore from assembling the treadmill, I changed my routine to include getting up Â½-hour earlier for my treadmill workout; bio break; two glasses of water w/a handful of raw spinach; then force myself onto the treadmill regardless if Iâm tired/sick/lazyâ¦.As part of this, I also made a stalwart commitment to NEVER miss a treadmill dayâno matter what. For the first couple months, my treadmill routine strictly comprised âManualâ mode in which I manually shifted between treadmill Speed 4 with the incline feature on Level 4, then to Speed 5 w/no incline, then to Speed 7.5 w/no incline, and repeat this cycle for 30-minutes. After a while, my body adjusted to running on the treadmill five times p/week, and I started to mix it up twice a week or so with the available On-Demand workouts to prevent boredom. These modules are interesting to watch and run the gamut from fairly easy novice to insanely challenging expert level. Though I also purchased the upgrade for a personal trainer package, I have not yet tapped this function to date, since Iâm still not ready for that high-intensity level of cardio (suspect some of these pro trainers must be T-800 model Cyborgs). Astonishingly, between following Mark Wahlbergâs diet (older ripped guy, right??), along with a very light weight-training/push-ups/sit-ups regimen, Iâm actually starting to get rippedâdespite in my ever multiplying 50+ yearsâ¦. Doesnât matter if itâs raining or 100-degrees outside, every day I get my cardio. Never thought Iâd see my abs again, but right now I can probably squeeze out a four-pack. Iâm convinced the treadmill is the key to this, since nothing else has really changed in my routine, save for the treadmill portion.Treadmill OperationOverall, the NordicTrack 6.5Si is a great little unit and Iâm super-happy with the investment. Precise and well-crafted, the unit smoothly folds upright to reduce the footprint in my living space. The console immediately synced with my home WiFi. Graphics/audio on the 10-inch monitor are crystal clear. However, the consoleâs operating controls must have been designed by a millennial or someone else with 20/20 vision, because I canât see the 8-point font displayed in white on the control buttons without reading glasses, which I donât like to wear when Iâm running on a treadmill. Moreover, the issue is exacerbated by tiny control buttons that are way too small on the touch screen. Itâs like trying to hit a tiny moving target while running. Inevitably, Iâll hit the wrong speed or incline button, which is a distraction from my workout. It would be great if some day NordicTrack can add a voice activation function, so users donât have to push buttons whatsoever while working out.The On-Demand modules are interesting, and the aesthetics are breathtaking. Sometimes, it kind of takes the sting out of a challenging run, since the vibe feels like youâre running next to a pro trainer on a beach or through the woods in some exotic location. There are countless varieties/workouts/levels to choose from. That said, I wish there were a few in which the trainers didnât speak at all. Most of them wonât stop yacking, which is disruptive when Iâm trying to get my head in the zone. Also, it could just be me, but I was unable to find a headphone jack or any way whatsoever to sync my Sony XM wireless headphones to the treadmill. The only option I could find was to play audio or my own music through the treadmillâs built-in speaker system. This is not a plausible option for me, since Iâm not confident other people in my home would like to listen to Slipknot or the equivalent cranked for a 1/2-hour every morning. As a work-around I usually listed to music on my iPhone with headphones and turn the sound off on the On-Demand modules.The motor/belt have worked perfectly with plenty of power under constant change. However, the console software frequently gets âhung-upâ while updating and I have to reboot at least once a week. In fact, a couple weeks ago I had to perform a âhard reset,â which was a hassle because it seriously delayed my only window to work out in the morning and killed my routine.Overall, I couldnât be happier with the NordicTrack 6.5Si. For me, selecting a treadmill was a big investment decision, which, fortunately, turned out to be the right one.

    Broken piece - waiting for over a month for replacement.
  
",1.0,hernandez,"Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2021","









  
  
    
  I wish I could rate this machine but I have been unable to use it at all. I received the machine on December 2020. The box was a little beat up but I decided to inspect it further before sending it back. I did not see any further immediate evidence of damage from shipping. I began to assemble the machine until I got to assembling the heart beat monitor cross bracket. The bracket was bent on one side. Not due to shipping but rather a factory defect. It would not fit on the machine. No problem. I got an extended warranty from NordicTrack. I sent them a picture and asked for a replacement. I was contacted that day and the replacement part was ordered. It is now February 7, 2021 and I have not received the part. I called customer service and inquired about three weeks ago and was told the part was on back order. The tracking number they gave me just says, âIn Progressâ as the order status. They told me that the part was going to get to the factory on February 2nd. I am not inflexible and can understand that the part is on back order and I just have to wait. Today, February 7, 2021, I still cannot use the machine because I have not received the replacement part to make the machine operable. The tracking status still says âin progress.â I am beyond frustrated at this point. If I have a customer that has been waiting for over a month for a replacement part I would make sure to expedite that order because that is unacceptable under any metric. I wish I was hopeful to receive the part before spring but I am not. I am going to give them the benefit of a couple more weeks and then try to send the machine back to Amazon.

    Great basic treadmill!
  
",5.0,Julie W.,"Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  Picked this up due to covid gym closures in my area. It's a nice basic model with everything I wanted, minus the fan (but no biggie, I have a standing one near by).Assembly was easy, and I was able to put it together in about 1 hour max. Instructions suggests 2 people to assemble, but I was able to do it myself taking extra caution when needed. When attaching the folding spring under the unit, I used a chair to prop it up as I saw someone in another review. It worked great.The treadmill is super heavy, so if you're moving it upstairs, you'll def need two people. It's pretty sturdy, though not as solid as a commercial treadmill.I don't care for the ifit programs and was able to set this up and bypass the sign up prompt by pressing the ifit button for 30 seconds (as mentioned in other reviews). Contrary to the unit saying it's locked and can only be started by using the ifit program, you can get around it with no problem!It has nice size cup holders that can hold 5 lb. dumbbells (I use these intermittently when I power walk). And it has a good size ledge that can hold a iphone, ipad, remote and skinny water bottle all at once.All in all, 5 stars from me! I do recommend this for anyone looking for a decent basic treadmill with horsepower to run, jog or walk, along with a push button incline. And I believe it's made in the USA!

  This treadmill works. The belt moves, the speeds change and the elevation also changes. If youre looking for something that will measure your heart rate or accurately account for how many calories you have burned or the distance you've gone then pass on by. None of those features work properly. Not to mention the frustration with the Ifit program that several other people warned about in prior reviews. The trick with holding the button down did not work for mine. I had to sign up for the free trial and then go into my account and cancel it right after to make sure i was not charged later on. I'm very disappointed that the heart rate monitors are way off. Telling me my heart rate is 40 after running for 20 minutes even when trying it standing completely still. It also will tell me I have burned almost 1000 calories in 45 minutes. I am in shape but I'm no olympic runner. Its completely off. Buyers beware.

    READ FOR iFit BYPASSING TIP AND EXPERIENCE
  
",5.0,The Right Family,"Reviewed in the United States November 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  IMPORTANT: You do not need to sign-up with iFit to use this machine. You have to use the Treadmill KEY (The small red rectangular shaped piece of plastic attached to the black string with clip on the end) to bypass iFit and workout on the machine, manually (access-wise) or âold-schoolâ. I registered and signed-up for iFit because I was interested to see what they have going on but it is not for me. I like to hear my own music when Iâm running and not someone talking in my head/ears. Itâs cool though but not for me.MACHINE: Absolutely love this machine! This is perfect for busy parents with little to no time to workout during the day so we can put in the work after the children goes to bed! Assembly took about 2.5 hours maximum (1 person plus some help here and there). It is very HEAVY!!! It is very easy to fold and unfold too. It is not very noisy so thatâs good. The 5 inch screen is small but itâs budget friendly and we manage. Nothing too fancy but itâs okay. I would recommend getting a treadmill mat to protect your machine and floor. Delivery was good to so I highly recommend!

    BEWARE: top console wobbles severely!
  
",1.0,2helpful,"Reviewed in the United States December 19, 2019","









  
  
    
  This was professionally assembled by Amazon services. The control console with screen and handles wobbles sideways very severely when walking, even worse at higher speeds when running. The Amazon assembly man said this happened on all of these Nordic Track treadmills and could not be fixed. Even at 3 mph, the whole top that you hold onto swings sideways. left-right-left - with EVERY STEP YOU TAKE! This made me quite seasick when watching the workout progress screen and I have never been seasick in my life before. I have worked out on treadmills for 25 years and never had this issue before. My wife had same problem, saying even walking on this treadmill was like being in a small boat during a storm. The faster you go, the more severe the side swaying/wobbling. Going to have to return this to Amazon.

  I think it's important to leave reviews for others on a purchase of this size.  Especially considering there are so many negative reviews.  My package was delivered without any issues.  No damage, and it even sat out in the frigid Upstate NY air for over 24 hours before being brought inside.  I also opted for the free service which meant it was delivered to my front porch.  It's heavy, don't get me wrong, but two people can easily carry it up a flight of stairs.  When I say ""two people,"" I mean two women, one of which has zero upper body strength.  Talking about myself here.  Anyway, assembly is certainly complicated, but not impossible.  The hardware is all labeled by each step of installation.  I think it's important to read each step carefully, and even jump ahead 2-3 steps to get more information.  Some of the parts has screws already attached that were discarded before assembly.  Just pay attention and you'll be good to go.  You only need a second person for installation of the hydraulic leg for folding by the way.  Everything else can easily be managed on your own.Enough about this iFit nonsense.  Get your phone out, indicate that you have the standard screen (not color touch screen), and select the option to skip set-up using your smart phone/tablet.  It unlocks the treadmill practically in an instant.  Anyone with a healthy set of eyes should be able to figure that out no problem.So far so good on the operation of the machine.  It's not any louder than any other treadmill and the flex step definitely absorbs a significant amount of shock.  No wobbling, squeaking, shaking or anything else that shouldn't be happening.  I'm a bit confused by the way it tracks distance by the 100th of a mile instead of 10th, but I can get used to that.I prefer to run outdoors; hate the gym setting.  However, I've still got my Planet Fitness membership when a feel the need to run with a buddy while the sidewalks are covered in snow.  Really excited to have this treadmill for those quick morning or evening workouts that don't require driving, let alone changing in a smelly locker room.  I'll update this review if I find any issues with continued operation.

  Iâve been wheelchair bound for 5 years, then used a walker. Remain unstable on a cane. This treadmill can be set to 0.5 speed setting. Warning always start the warmup and trail with feet straddling the track. The video gives me focus to keep going. A mirror in front helps with foot placement. Started doing just the warmup. Now up to 15 minutes at speed 1.  For me I see my feet work better going up hill. Taught me to add stretches to improve walking on level ground. I may walk again normally with practice.

  Iâve had my T 6.5 si treadmill for a month and have used it every day. Iâm so incredibly happy with this purchase. I assembled the treadmill by myself without difficulty and have had zero problems with it so far. The only issue I had is that there was no code for my year of free Ifit included in the box, but I called Ifit support and they immediately activated my membership over the phone. I cannot recommend the Ifit program enough. The quality of the videos is outstanding, the trainers are fantastic, and the workouts are incredibly fun. I enjoy them so much that I have to talk myself *out* of working out several times a day so I donât overdo it. My only complaint with Ifit is that the user interface leaves a bit to be desired (difficult to search/sort through available workouts, etc.), but everything else about it is so great that it makes up for this inconvenience. Iâm a very happy Nordictrack/Ifit customer!

  The assembly of this treadmill is easy and straight forward while following the directions. Once I finished assembly and turned it on I was immediately impressed with how solid it was when I ran on it. I haven't used the iFit programs yet, but I have used the basic run program. It's great to see the run time, speed, and distance all at the same time on the display. It's easy to connect to my wireless gateway, the bluetooth is great to connect to my phone, the speakers and display are awesome, and the fan works great.  I love the space saving option by locking the treadmill in the upward position. I can't think of any negative things, this is simply an outstanding treadmill.

  I recently bought my Nordic Track T series 6.5. I love it. Even my husband loves it. It took me a morning to put together, yes I needed a little help from my husband but was able to accomplish most of it on my own. Caution on step one. I had to take the monitor off to get the bolt covers for the feet on. My fault I didnt read the instructions thoroughly. The instructions were Easy though. A few questions but you also get a 3D aid if you use BILT app to help you put it together. (I didnt know this before I put it together. Again I should read the papers that came with the machine better.)As for needing to use the IFIT machine to get it to work. NO YOU DON'T! THERE IS AN OVER RIDE. PRESS THE IFIT BUTTON FOR 30 SECONDS. You can you the treadmill just fine without using the IFIT. I was scared of some reviews that complained about this. IGNORE THEM.1 free month trial with Ifit? IFit offers it regardless. Although I am doing the 100% free trial and am really enjoying it. Even contemplating buying a subscription. It really motivates me and keeps me on my workout routine.  You do not have to pay. Just do not put in payment information. I have a receipt that says $0.00 for my month of ifit subscription. Using caution I also used a throw away email in case they asked for to much info. They dont. Bare bones. Height, weight, sex, email. That's it. Again you DO NOT HAVE TO PUT IN YOUR CREDIT CARD INFO to get your free trial.I am a stay at home mom since March of a toddler and have packed on the pounds. I am so excited to get my weight back under control and my Nordic Treadmill is going to help get me there. Also my husband is so glad I got this so he too can use it. We've both packed on some weight since becoming parents and then dealing with the stress of the pandemic. He's using it as much as I am. Even made sure we got new good shoes while we use it to keep our knees happy.I can not praise this treadmill enough. If you are on the fence or have doubts. I was there too. I got mine for a steal at a little over $600. Watch the price and buy when you can. I have no regrets.

  First off this thing is big.  Two men carried it from the truck.  It stayed right where it was until the assembly team showed up a few days later.  The thing I love the most is the I-fit integration.  This takes my workouts to a entire different level.  The trainers really push me.  When the workout is over I am really sweating....something that seldom happens when I  simply spend 20-30 minutes on a treadmill.  The I-Fit combo is what takes everything about this to the next level. It seems there is a workout for wherever you are on your fitness journey.  I am a 61 year old man....and they  have a lot for me to choose from.  Buy the machine....sign up for the I-Fit...it will take you where you want to go.  A great value.  Rock solid machine.  My only negatives.....heart rate monitor is wildly inaccurate....it sure deserves a fan.  Note to all treadmill designers.....why is the on off switch always in an awkward place typically at the floor....come on.

  Amazon freight shipping guys dropped it in our garage for us.Took 2-3 hours for us to assemble. Probably if you know exactly what you are doing, can be done in 30 mins.Have had it for 3 months, so far so good. Use for ~30 mins 4x a week.We were looking for something relatively affordable, sturdy, didn't care too much for features beside incline and speed.Seems sturdy enough when running, no wobbling unless the ground is uneven.Will update if anything changes in the next few years.Some things to keep in mind:- Hold down bluetooth/iFit to bypass iFit subscription when you turn on for the first time.- Walking belt slows down with every step on slow speeds (1-2MPH).- Can run fine, tried up to 8MPH. Maxes at 10MPH.- A little loud, have to turn up music when running.- Speakers not good for music.- Bluetooth is only used for iFit, not music connection.- Heavy. Fold up function is nice and helps when you need to move it (on its 2 tiny wheels).Also appreciate how generous ICON fitness was, by offering me a small giftof either a maintenance kit or floor mat in exchange for a positive review.

  Nothing special of a treadmill, based on the reviews I was hoping it was better quality.Assembly was easy, just follow directions. I see other people saying how unsafe this machine is, it is a treadmill people. It has moving parts, learn how to walk in real life and you can navigate this machine.I will say it is REALLY LOUD compared to what I expected.If this is near a bedroom, you will not be able to sleep if someone is on it.This thing is LOUD at 6am, when sound travels through the house. I installed wall to wall foam gym floor in the room, and I just ordered foam acoustic panels to place under and around this thing, hoping it helps absorb some sound. Definitely wouldn't be able to use in an apartment complex. I will see how the panels work in a few weeks.I am 180 pounds and 6ft, it can handle my weight easy. I can't run on it while others are sleeping due to the noise, even walking on it seems to be loud if someone is sleeping.Better than nothing when it comes to the closed gyms due to Covid19, but kinda wish I dropped another couple hundred of my Trump bucks for a better (quieter) machine.I expect this to hold up to the miles I plan to put on it, so I would recommend, just know it is not as quiet as I hoped/expected.

  Took me 45 days to get this product out of my door when I tried to return it. I spent hours and hours on the phone with amazon and the pick-up service they use. The pick-up service was TERRIBLE. They wouldn't call me back, they would schedule a day without telling me, they would come to my house and refuse to take it, etc. It was a freaking nightmare.About the treadmill though:I am quite short so my legs are quite short (5'2) but they would always hit the top cover that hides the motor when I ran. I could scoot back but then I'd practically be off the treadmill, and it is hard to scoot back when you have it all the way inclined. That being said, the incline worked fine. The screen was quite good. The folding up wasn't very good. When you go to fold the track up, it always rubbed against one of the handles (left one). The iFit is annoying. We accidentally subscribed so I had to call them directly and cancel our subscription (which thankfully was very easy and the guy made it a breeze). The treadmill was just not worth the price.

  The machine itself id great (After I bypassed the iFit thing)  There are other apps or YouTube channels that provide similar if wanting a virtual trail walk or something. If you really want the iFit option, go for it, Im sure its fine.Ordering was fast and easy, not Prime. but it was sold by Amazon so there was a delivery option. I chose the earliest available which was 2 days after purchasing. Delivery was set for Sunday!Excitedly waiting the item to arrive but let down hard when the time passed and nothing. Contacted Amazon and assurances were made and credits provided (for Amazon items of course)11 days after it was first ordered, 9 days after original delivery date the treadmill finally arrived.  Just in time too, expected to snow for 2 days.. The guys that delivered were nice however so I appreciate that but the whole 9 day fiasco was ridiculous. I have never had this bad of an experience from Amazon in the 15 years I've been ordering from them. One of the support people even had the gall to tell me ""Its not Prime you know""As for the device itself.. Assembly was not bad at all, went up in about an hour. Like some purchasing the machine I bypassed the iFit by holding the iFit button down till the screen activated (make sure the magnetic stop key is inserted first lol) Device worked great! cant wait to start using it on a regular basis.*Note to fitbit users.. doesn't seem to register steps so keep those arms swinging!Youtube has some virtual trails, or other apps in the App stores.. check them out!So far, I recommend buying this device, I just hope shipping doesn't effect you as it did me

Instructions are very clear.  The unit is securely packed to prevent damage. Small parts are packaged to coordinate with the steps in the instructions. Large parts are well identified Very well engineered, clear instructions, easy to follow.  I feel the two fit peopler are required to unpack and position the track.

  First off, pay for professional installation. It took me three hours by myself and they donât even give you tools to screw in the bolts. Luckily, I had a mini wrench that I found but it wasnât strong enough to make the bolts flush. I will have to go out and get a socket wrench. I researched many treadmills with the iFit model. I definitely need motivation and I get bored on machines. This was the cheapest one, brand-name, with iFit. I wear a Fitbit So I wasnât concerned at all about the machines heart rate monitor which was completely inaccurate. Additionally, the calories burned on these preset programs on iFit was also inaccurate. Do yourself a favor, get a Fitbit watch or something similar to track these yourself. This treadmill is very flippin heavy. There is absolutely no way one person can move it by themselves. It is well-built. It is quite it has the same quality of the treadmills at the gym. I have not tried the speakers yet so I cannot review them at this time. You do not have to get the iFit as others have stated, but again, nowhere does it say that. At $15 a month, if you need the motivation and you like to see the world, get the iFit. You can cancel at any time. The trainers that take you around the world are immersive, and takes your mind off of what you are doing at the time - working out. Overall, I think this was a great buy considering I was looking at other treadmills from $500-$1000 more. This thing Works. I was sore for a couple of days after my very first workout with I fit which was a simple 32 minute walking tour through London. The last couple of minutes had me going up a hill. The incline and speed adjusts automatically. I did not have to press any buttons myself. I was quite shocked that I was even sore as I walk at least 10,000 steps a day and walk all day long for 10 hours at my job. I do not regret this purchase.

  I had great hopes when I bought a Nordic Track. Great well known name, what could be better?Unfortunately, that became what could be worse?Assembling was difficult b/c the bolts and holes weren't smooth and easy to thread. Usually, threads are cleaned out by machine during manufacturing, they must have skipped this step. Most bolts were hard to start and tighten, which I've read in other reviews.After assembly, spouse got on it and found it squeaks while in use. I tried several lubricating steps recommended in other reviews without success. Not a bad squeak, but annoying on a new machine.We contacted Nordic Track via phone and on website. No response. I also contacted Amazon, and Amazon left a voice mail with my number. I got no response. Finally got a case opened via Facebook. Their response? ""Your feet are probably dragging on the belt, please take care not to do that"".Because of the significant cost, we decided to return it due to an unresolved noise and poor/no response from manufacturer. The only way to return it is to have it disassembled and packed in the original box. In the end, I'm out 3-5 hours assembly/disassembly and moving this up/down stairs.So, yeah, not worth the hassle.

    DO NOT BUY THIS TREADMILL!!
  
",1.0,Whodat!,"Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2021","









  
  
    
  Treadmill arrived with damage to some of the cosmetic plastic pieces that cover the electronics and mechanical parts. No big deal, I had purchased the extended warranty just in case, so Nordic track agreed to ship replacement parts -- for me to install. The bigger problem was that when I first turned the treadmill on (and by-passed their attempt to ""up-sell"" you into their online workouts which involve a  monthly  fee) the instructions directed me to calibrate the incline motor. When I started the calibration process, the incline motor immediately jammed and would not function at all. The belt would turn but the deck was inclined and would not adjust. I contacted Nordic Track and after a half-hour wait to talk to someone and another half hour of troubleshooting, they agreed to send me a new motor. They offered to send a technician to install the motor, but said it might take weeks to schedule. So, I waited 2 weeks for the new motor to arrive, installed it myself and the new motor immediately jammed as soon as I powered up the treadmill.  When I contacted Nordic Track again (re another hour on the phone) they agreed to send more parts and a technician.  A few days later, I received an email from Nordic Track threatening to void my warranty because the treadmill was located in a garage.  They demanded photographic evidence of the treadmill's location.  I sent a photo of the unit in my finished, insulated, climate-controlled garage along with the large flat screen tv and home gym set-up that are located there.  Nordic Track did not respond, so I arranged a return and refund thru Amazon. Amazon's customer  service was AMAZING!! I highly recommend that if you do decide to take a chance and buy this questionable product, do it thru Amazon, because Amazon will take care of you when Nordic Track inevitably screws you over.

  So Nordic Track decided to try to get people to pay a gym membership to them from their homes with this iFit scam nonsense.  This seems to be the norm with a lot of these treadmill companies.  So you sign up for iFit, and then cancel it immediately.  That's fine.  I'd spend the $80 bucks to get some poor soul to install it at your house.  I chose to do it myself to save money and it was a huge pain in the neck.  Folding this machine is some what easy, but it's definitely not portable or easy to move.  There are wheels that are less than 2"" in diameter that you're suppose to pull it with.Again, when using it as a treadmill, it works great.  Just look out for the iFit scam.

  I wish this treadmill had a fan built in like my previous treadmill.The fact that you are forced to sign up with ifit.com before being able to use it is very annoying and not very fair to the consumer. I should not be forced to do anything by a seller or product.However, as someone else described the procedure to bypass the mandatory registration with ifit, simply:1. Attach the safety cord2. Press and hold the ifit button for 30 seconds.This procedure will allow you to use the treadmill without having to register. You only have to do this one time.On the positive side, the treadmill feels comfortable during its intended use. It is not very noisy except when changing the inclination. Folding and un-folding is done easily and quietly.

  First off I want to tell you that I did not even try the iFit trial, so I can not speak to that. I was looking for a good treadmill to use with Zwift and have found this treadmill works perfectly for that. I needed to be able to pair it with the Zwift program and found that the Zwift Runn paired with this treadmill and the speeds matched exactly with no calibration of the Runn needed. I had first tried the Zwift running pod, but found the speeds it recorded were not accurate. I highly recommend this treadmill for indoor running, especially for pairing with the Zwift platform.

  Iâve had this for about a month now. Iâm a 50 year old that is trying to get back into jogging again.Assembly. Took about two hours by myself.Now...Iâm not counting the hour I took looking for another screw (Step #1) because the supplied screw did not fit.After that...things went smooth.I love this machine. I bypassed the Ifit like every one said and held the button down about 10 seconds. I may consider it in the future but just starting out.I just figured out this morning that you can adjust the cushion on the track. Looking forward to running on that tonight.I was honestly looking at the $350-$400 price range but after reading soooo many reviews, (mostly bad in that price range in reliability)  this one seemed like a worthwhile gamble to spend the extra money. I use it about 30-45 min every other day. For the price I really think it would be hard to beat.

  We have had this treadmill for a month now. My husband and I both use it a few times a week. He is the runner and I like to do inclined power walking. We are both very happy with this treadmill.It's by no means ""gym quality"" but it fits the bill for an average home user looking to get or stay in shape.It has plenty of features that make it impressive for the price point. We love the folding feature because it gives us a bit more space when it's not in use. The belt is plenty wide and long and the motor keeps up with my husband's runs.The only couple things that are slightly disappointing are there is no fan but that's easily resolved by placing one nearby and the speakers in the console are not good quality, but we have a Bluetooth speaker in our workout room. Neither of these are deal breakers for us especially considering the price tag.As other reviews have mentioned, the iFit membership can be bypassed by holing fown the iFit button for a few seconds, then you're ready to go.If youre looking for a good value treadmill with lots of features I would recommend this one.

  This is a good quality treadmill for the money, easy to assemble, and easy to use.  I don't need any features other than some simple numbers for speed, time, and distance, and this machine is fine for that without anything else.  It comes with a large red stop sign that says the machine will not work until you go to iFit and activate, whatever that is.  I called the phone number instead, nobody home.  So I went to iFit and the only option was to type in a credit card.  I did, and then and only then found that if I would just hold the iFit button down for 20 seconds or so, that would activate the machine without whatever iFit might be.  So I logged onto my new iFit account and set the status to cancel whatever it was that I signed up for.  This is pretty shady and if I would have known about their methods in advance I would have looked for a different machine or company.

  I've been using this machine for a little under a month. So far, I have no complaints, except for some intermittent connectivity issues. You don't have to sign up for ifit; there are instructions in the reviews and q & a section for activating without it. However, I'm using ifit just to test out the different workouts, and I'm enjoying it so far. I only did a little bit of research to find a treadmill. It can get overwhelming, but this brand and model seemed to meet all of my requirements and reliability. My husband moved and assembled it for me. It fits well into the corner of our fitness room, and it folds up conveniently so my husband can pull his bench out. There haven't been any noise issues, and I haven't used the speakers, since I normally use my headphones. Overall, I'm happy with my purchase.

  I was going crazy, being locked in the house during COVID. I have two children, the youngest still being a bit of a loose cannon and we live on a busy road. I didn't feel like I could safely go for a walk with her and even my oldest isn't old enough by legal standards to stay at home with her. I'm working from home, sitting all day. At least at the office, I'd walk the building, around the building; but at home. . . it was just sitting. This machine gives has been a God-Send, best 700 bucks I've spent in a while. I use it daily to get my exercise, burn off steam and get the endorphins going. So far so good, it gives me a good quality work-out every time. I will say assembly was a challenge at  times, as was moving the package. I had to open the box in my foyer where they left it and carry the pieces to the living room for assembly. It says you need two people and you're probably better off - it is heavy and cumbersome. I didn't have that option though, so me and my 11 dollar tool kit that I keep around the house got this thing assembled in about 6 hours. I did follow the instructions, but I also followed a video on Youtube and I had no issues with having to disassemble or redo anything. Even managed to adjust the belt and felt very accomplished afterwards. I love it, best thing I could have done for myself. The only thing I did not like was IFit- so I couldn't bypass it and it sounded cool. I did the trial, I signed up for a bunch of classes that sounded awesome- walk through the pyramids of Egypt, yes please. I started the first, only to have my treadmill literally take off under neath me. I had to pull th cord and shut it down, the instructor wasn't even moving yet. IFit would have been great if it didn't control my machine, I need to control my pace and incline. I cancelled it that night.

  The delivery drivers notified me when they were on the way, the box was in pristine condition, it was on time, and the instructions were very straight forward. It runs perfectly and is exactly what I wanted.There are two cons:1. You must have a second person to put this together.2. NordicTrack makes you think you have to register for their iFit program for your treadmill to even turn on. This is not true. You can bypass the registration process by just turning the machine on, putting the safety stopper fab into its place and holding down the iFit button.

  Hey all,I brought this treadmill because all of my gyms closed down on the post I work for in the military. I have to stay ready at all times. There were a lot of treadmills I researched to get to my final destination. I wanted the high-end ones but this works fantastically. I have no complaints. The screen works clearly and the touch configurations work great even when you're covered in sweat. I can see and touch my buttons even with my glasses off. I had to build this alone because I brought some new shoes with this purchase, and my spouse was at work. I was too excited to start back running. It took me a couple of hours (I was watching law and order and eating lunch). The delivery team brought it to right to my doorstep that helped a lot. This treadmill is worth the money especially the IFIT that comes with. The coaches keep me engaged and ready to go. The stats are saved by my wifi too. Overall dreams come true.

  First, I was disappointed to discover this treadmill was made in china.  Delivery was quite fast, but the box was damaged and the treadmill suffered minor scratches.  Moving the treadmill from the front porch to the assembly location was thought, itâs very heavy.  I removed the parts from the box to move them easier.  Assembly was ok, fit of the parts was ok, weâll see how durable it is.  Activation is a pain.  Eventually we figured out by holding the Bluetooth button down for 20-30 seconds, the online activation is not necessary.  The treadmill work fine, as expected.  It seems powerful enough for walking, jogging, maybe a slowish runner.  Not sure a sprint would be supported?  But, it does feel powerful.  Several workout programs are offered.  The display is nice too, easy to read track graphic.  Overall, it seems ok so far.  Wish it was made anywhere but China.  Probably wouldnât have bought something else had I known.

They can definitely use a pointer or two from ikea on how to create assembly instructions. Luckily we had the tools necessary to make the job a bit easier but if you have no tools, good luck.So far the machine seems to working pretty well.Also, DO NOT SIGN UP FOR THEIR FIT THING!

  The Good:  Solid, well-built machine.  Excellent motor warranty.  The Not-So-Good:  Tracking adjustment access is horrible.  Aligning the hex wrench with the roller screw is difficult because there is about 1 1/2"" space between the hex wrench access hole and the roller screw head.  The area is covered by a trim piece with limited visual access from the side.  Even using a flashlight, it was difficult to get the hex wrench fitted into the roller screw head.The Worst:  The owner,s manual does not tell you that the treadmill can be unlocked without signing up for ifit.  The ifit deal wants you to sign up for specialized programs for a monthly fee.  Guess what.  The same company owns both NordicTrack and ifit.  You can unlock the machine by pressing and holding the ifit logo on the console for 30 seconds.Thankfully, a prior reviewer made that information available.  If you just want the basics with out paying for the extra frills, you don't need to subscribe to ifit.

  When looking for a treadmill I was looking for a dependable brand that was as low cost as possible.  And then I learned about iFit and decided to make that a requirement and I'm glad I did.  This one is perfect because its low cost so it doesn't have its own screen and we just use our iPad which works great.  The iFit software is pretty awesome as it has training series where the trainer will run through Thailand or Greece or wherever and then the machine's speed and incline will automatically change with the trainer as she / he goes through the run / walk / hike.  We love it.  Only downside is that the treadmill now makes some more squeaking noise as it moves so I'm going to check into oil and the like but I'm not worried as it seems to be well constructed.  All in all - we'd recommend.

  Does not come with iFit code free trial as it states. It came with a card with an authorization code that has already been used ifit was no help they said this is a scam, itâs been months of trying to get a hold of a real person that I can even get this sorted out with....the treadmill itself is sturdy and does the job but it wouldâve been nice to actually get what is advertised on the Amazon listing as that is what swayed me to buy this over another brand....disappointed to say the least in the seller.

  Replacing a 6 yr old treadmill by another manufacture. That machine worked well for a long time.  Wanted a basic treadmill for the wife and I to walk on with some slow paced running.  Bought this product.  Assembly was okay. Had to disassemble some shipping screws and re-assemble with correct screws as part of the assembly process.  All in all the fit and finish is what I expected.  The belt seems to work just fine thought I wish it had a system where the belt will self adjust as it wears or an indicator that will show when the belt needs tightening.  Hello! Ever hear of a constant tension spring?Use- You MUST sign up with iFIT to get it to work. If we were hard core workout people then iFIT is something that we will use. And maybe we will grow into it.  Did not like that we could not assemble and turn it on and have it just work. Now I have to go back and remember the username and password, as if I don't have enough of those already, to discontinue the iFit subscription.  Wife used the most basic program to start and that was soon too much for her as it went from an incline of 2 to 6.  She is using it now mostly on manual mode where she has to input her own selections as she works out.  Really this machine is made for a more advanced runner than a light walker, jogger.  Time will tell if we use it more or less than our old machine.  We don't fold it and unfold it as it is part of the gym so it just stays in use position.

    Assembly and IFit

  Why in the world would you have some many different types of screws and bolts? I had three different size bolts just for the side rails. When you install the side rails, do not tighten them up just leave them a bit loose or you will never get the pulsebar installed.  As for the IFit, Amazon should be ashamed of itself to allow NordicTrack/ IFit to hold an expensive piece of equipment hostage until you provide IFit with your credit card in order to turn the damn thing on.All three of you can do better on this.  The bypass trick of holding the IFit logo down for 30 sec does not seem to work in the newer purchased units. I know you don't want the average Joe to assemble these machines' when you can have a service person do it for another fee. There are assemble videos available on Utube take a look at a couple before you start,

    Nice treadmill, getting parts challenging
  
",4.0,David Green,"Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2021","









  
  
    
  Once we got it working, it is a nice machine.  It is big and heavy so plan your location (including proximity to power), get your mat, surge protector,  before you start assembly.  It does fold easily but it still will not go through most doorways assembled.As luck would have it, ours came damaged during the pandemic.  We did not unbox for a while (time, procrastination) and thus missed some options like return although that would have been challenging during the pandemic as well.  The damage was a dead-center hit of one of the poles in the box with the electronic console knocking a crippling indentation on the display.  We were sent to NordicTrack for resolution and they agreed to replace the console upon appropriate documentation.  It was quite a wait for the part.  I suspect replacement part fulfillment was competing with new production but don't know.  Anyway, after 3 months we got the replacement part, figured out how to do the repair, and things are now great.

    Just what I needed
  
",5.0,LongClearLens,"Reviewed in the United States February 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was 47 yrs old, 5""10"" and 231 pounds when I bought this treadmill.I am very pleased with this after a couple months of daily use. I find this treadmill to be very comfortable to run on. The track is large, and very fast. I have yet to go past halfway on the speed.What I like the best is that I only bought a treadmill, not a computer station with it. I don't need anything beyond how fast and how far. That's what this offers.Very easy to fold and unfold, I am very happy with this machine overall.I had no issues with the assembly, it was easy and the instructions were simple.The one issue I had was with the iFit connection. The treadmill comes with giant warnings saying that it is ""locked"" and that you have to make an iFit account to unlock it.I did that to only find out that I never needed to do so. All I had to do was hold down the iFit button for 30 seconds and the machine was unlocked. This was in the way back of the assembly instructions.That really upset me because I had already opened the iFit account and put in my credit card info.Why lie to me NordicTrack? I don't care what iFit is paying you, that is simply unethical to make me think that I needed to open an iFit account with a credit card to use the treadmill that I bought, then recant this at the end of the instructions.So if you buy this, and I would definitely recommend it, please be aware that if you don't want the iFit account, you don't have to make one.

    Random Bargain for a Great, Basic Treadmill
  
",5.0,Jahn Braquet,"Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2021","









  
  
    
  I happened to find this treadmill for about $685 and quickly researched and then purchased. I'm glad I did because the price immediately went back up to almost $1,000. Although I don't remember the description mentioning the machine folding, I'm glad that it does. The deck is long and comfortable to run or walk on, and the incline feature works great. By the numbers the deck might not be quite as wide as what you may use at the gym, but I can't feel the difference. My one and only gripe is that the front of the deck ends too close to the controls for my liking, so I'm constantly feeling like I'm too far back compared to machines that I'm used to.  The iFit nonsense is easy enough to bypass and at this point it's obvious that it's there. The whole number speed and incline buttons are nice and work well, but I wish the ""+"" and ""-"" buttons felt a bit more responsive on the display. The start to 1mph and stop ramp up/down a bit faster than what I'm used to, but I'll get used to that. Overall, the quality feels solid and the machine isn't overly loud - I have it in my living room for reference. The additional cushioning for the running deck is nice too. Lastly, you really don't need a media screen for double the normal price of this machine. The phone/tablet ledge works great and I can watch shows on TV or a device while running just fine on this machine.

  I'd like to start by saying this thing was terribly frustrating to put together. The instructions are simple, but you have to fight the bolts to get them in place. It took me 30 minutes just to get the handles attached because the bolts catch so frequently.Two parts of it were damaged upon arrival (that I have noticed this far). A metal bar along the bottom and the top of the arm where the handles attach. I have yet to reach out to customer service.I have ran on it four times so far, and one of those times the screen was stuck on a loading screen image, but I was still able to control it manually and run, but it did not save my workout data.It feels great to run on, but I've been a little nervous considering the cost.

",5.0,Daniel,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2019","









  
  
    
  I was worried about the negative reviews, where the product arrived damaged. Mine arrived fine, although I'm slightly unhappy that Amazon lets you ""choose"" a drop-off time window and UPS unilaterally changed it. I chose 0600-0900 on Saturday and UPS said 1400-1800. However, UPS delivered it in the original Amazon time window (at approximately 7 a.m.), and not during the UPS updated window.As for the product, I don't plan to use the fitness app, and I was able to disable the prompts immediately by pressing the iFit app button for several seconds, as another reviewer noted.As for the treadmill, I was able to set it up by myself, with a bit of difficulty. It is probably far easier to set it up with two people. As another reviewer noted, it is probably better to set it up in the room in which you intend to use it. It is fairly heavy, but the track lifts easily for storage. The cup holders kinda suck for most things other than cups, but there is a ledge you can use for phones/TV remotes.The functions are suitable for my purposes. I mostly intend to walk with it to increase my exercise while I watch TV. I tried the faster speeds, and this thing is FAST! I find walking to be most comfortable between 2.5 and 3.0. You can increase speeds and incline incrementally by 0.1 of a unit. I do not really use the incline, but it's a neat feature I might explore if I advance in skill. I disabled the sound beeps, and it is now fairly quiet to operate. I can walk (at a fast clip) and watch my shows without disturbing my housemates one room over. I'm happy I went with this model over the cheaper budget units. Although I'm not ready to use all the features of this model, I'm glad I have that option for the future.Solid device, and about the only model at this price point with the features I wanted.

  My biggest complaint with this equipment is the ability to play music. It has 2 large speakers but if you don't subscribe to iFit then they are useless. They have a port which the instructions state you can insert your iPod in.  I think I stopped using an iPod back in the 90's. At this price range you should be able to use any of the modern devices to play your music. But they have seen fit to partner with iFit and limit your music choice to only them.  I hate it when a company tries to force you to use a product that you don't want and certaintly don't want to pay monthly for.It folds easily but still leaves a big footprint in the folded position because it doesn't fold up even close to vertical.I paid to have this assembled for me.

  I have owned several Treadmills in my time including: Landice, Lifespan and Life Fitness. I knew what I was buying this time around getting a simple, low cost unit; as I no  longer pound this by running, but merely walk briskly. It is well built for the $1000 price point, but that is where it ends. The iFIT is useless to me and therefore it lacks Basic programs like Hills, Intervals, Weight Loss, etc. use. It is literally manual for speed and incline. It does not even have time set, just time elapsed. I tried to like iFIT but it only has lame slow ""walks"" and nothing over 45 minutes. So, you constantly have to adjust the treadmill the entire time to go faster/slower and the worst part is taking a break and then set up another walk/run after a typical 20 or 30 minute session. CONSUMERS NEED TO KNOW! - If you plan to not use iFIT... this is 100% Manual with ZERO built-in Programs.The screen is nice, but would be better to have WiFi used for TV or Internet. No Bluetooth? No way to turn the Monitor off? Shutting the main switch is a pain as it takes 10 minutes to boot up and start exercise the next time. It feels super clunky and like hollow plastic, but I forgive this for the price point. The biggest complaint is by far the Arms/Handles. They are not long enough! It forces you to be close to the console and therefore kick the heck out of the motor cover. That cover is very poorly designed and no reason it should extend and rise in the front. Likewise, the arms have almost no padding but an 1/8"" of foam and this numbs my palms. I have read many complaints of the same items. No one buying this level of treadmill is a world class athlete and therefore holding the handles/arms should be considered. I am sure it is all a cost savings like dropping the feet or wheels in the very front as was done recently. You have the chance to own the market as Sole is the only competition in this niche. I don't hate the T 6.5si, but it is a shame I don't like it either. Icon Fitness can easily make these changes for improvement and charge another $100. For now, I have adjusted my workout routine and use handlebar foam tape on the arms for some padding. From an engineering standpoint, the product should work around me and not the other way around. I would not buy it again and would have chosen the Sole 63 instead.

  This Treadmill does just what I need it to do.... provide a level walking service for 72 year old me. Considering:1. The delivery guy dropped it on the front patio, considering that the unit IN THE BOX would not fit thru the 36 inch door. We had to ""de-cant"" it outside and take it inside.2. We are both in our 70s and it is very heavy... thanks to an appliance dolly.. we got it into our living room3. Assembly went okay.. the manual has clear instructions.. but there are a couple of YouTube videos that helped (google search: assembly of Nordictrack  6.5S) One by I Con Fitness Assembly Help (NordicTrack T-series Assembly) ... and .. one by M A Furniture and Fitness Equipment Assembly.  It helped to watch them put one together first.4. We planned on putting it in the office... but the width is 36inches and would not fit thru the 30 inch door without a MAJOR wrestling match.... so we put it in the living room (at least I can watch TV in there)  And because it folds up.. it does not take up as much room as you would think...5. Order the SURGE SUPRESSOR (different from a Surge Protector).. when you order the treadmill... we had to wait 3 days to get one.... we did not want to risk the computer processor with our rural electrical grid.6.Treadmill...check.  Surge SUPRESSOR... check..... Major BUMMER the console would not light up.... Holiday weekend...Online to Activate with Ifit...signed up... did NOT get an activation code... Called AMAZON... they offered a replacement... at no charge.. to be shipped the next business day (10 days to get it by freight...)TURNS OUT... a couple of wires had pulled loose from the main connector... pushed them into the connector and everything works fine.  So.. we cancelled the replacement.This treadmill will work fine for what I need... walking...  the hardest part, for me, is holding it up and triggering the release latch with my short legs while standing on one leg.... the unit practically lowers itself down.  The balance is such that I can easily lift it up again for storage. It is somewhat easy to move.. if you need to.  And it is stable enough I don't have to worry about it falling over on the cats or the dog... even if bumped.

",3.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had a Pro-Form treadmill previously, and I liked it a lot more than I like this one, so far. The iFit ""scam"" is easy to get around... just hold the iFit button until the screen comes on. But, if you will have this treadmill in a room where small children may roam, you might want to rethink your plan to purchase. I bought this because I appreciate the fold-up feature, but it doesn't fold up as perpendicular to the floor as my old treadmill. It sticks out at an angle and the only thing keeping it up there is a hydraulic lock bar. I would be so nervous if I had toddlers in the house! I can easily imagine the bar ""unlocking"" spontaneously and descending upon someone's head. It doesn't drop quickly (another hydraulic benefit), but it's not a safe look.If you want to store this in a corner and wheel it out to use it, think, again. You store this in the corner, you use it in the corner, unless you want to exercise before getting on the treadmill. It's very awkward to move because they didn't put wheels in good places and it's a very heavy treadmill. There are only 2 wheels on the bottom and they are not in a spot that makes it easy to move. I'm really surprised that a product made by such an expensive and well-known brand is so poorly designed. I never thought they'd place the wheels in such an unhelpful location.Folded, the treadmill is an eye-sore. That is largely true of all treadmills, but I had a Pro-Form before that was designed better, so the running platform didn't stick out while folded. The console is huge for how average it is. The layout of the screen information feels crowded and poorly designed.I'm happy to have a new treadmill, but this is the kind of treadmill that belongs in a dedicated workout room. If you are into minimalist living and/or you have adventurous toddlers, maybe try a different machine.Also, I put this together completely alone. It took about 3 hours, but only because I kept wandering off to do other things. My downstairs neighbor says she can't tell I bought a treadmill, which might speak more to the construction of our building, but it's a plus. The treadmill is as noisy as most treadmills and it seems the shock absorber feature works decently. The width of the belt is perfect, but I don't feel like the motor provides smooth action. I felt some slight hitching as I walked this morning. Overall, I think this treadmill is overpriced for the quality.

They say not to use power tools but there is no way to get the screws in if you don't. Then on the bottom front there is a bolt on each side of the treadmill that you can't get in all the way! Used it twice and it makes a squeaking noise. The belt on the treadmill is thin and flimsy and is already flipping up on the sides!! What a rip off!! For what they charge they should put it together completely and stop using cheap parts. I would never buy from Nordic Track again. I was on the phone waiting for customer service today for over an hour. Finally I had to hang up. Poor quality, poor customer service. Amazon should stop selling their equipment or they should take the blame and send someone out to fix it.

  The treadmill works perfect. That said, even though it should take you only a half hour or at most an hour to install it does not. Why? The parts provided by the merchant were the wrong size. I had to go back and forth to the hardware store to get the correct size nuts/bolts/screws before I could build the damn thing. Took me 5 hours of back and forth and a lot of frustration. Do not struggle trying to make a square peg fit in a round hole. Use common sense and take a picture of the problem, go to the hardware store, explain the issue and have staff help you with a workaround. That is what I did. I should not have wasted my time trying to use the factory provided screws/bolts as they were the wrong size. Also tools are key. Some tools demand an extension or they will not fit in the tiny area so make sure you have the right tools to install. Other than the installation (which is easy if you have the right tools and parts) it works great. Lost 7 pounds so far on the treadmill after two and a half weeks. I walk, steep incline for 45 minutes twice a day, at 3 to 3.7 speed and poof weight falls off me like water out of the shower.  I also read my e book as I walk when I use the lower speed of 3.

    Machine arrived defective in many ways from the company who made it
  
",1.0,Katie Feliciani,"Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  I am so bummed right now. I spent a month trying to find a treadmill that wasn't insanely over priced or sold out because of the pandemic. My husband and I have been stuck inside our apartment for 5 months and we needed something to help us move around a bit more than our daily yoga routine. I decided to purchase this for my husband for his 30th birthday after again a month of deliberating on which machine to buy. I am so angry that we are not apart of the 68% of people who enjoyed this machine enough to give it 5 stars. There are a multitude of problems so I'll just start here.1. The machine and the parts that are broken are not due to Amazon's delivery and all parts that arrived damaged were things that happened in manufacturing. There is a bar that runs through the machine component where the motar is, this bar is held together at both ends by 2 large bolts (one on each side of the machine) on the left side the bolt is aligned and correctly placed. On the right size the bolt was not correctly aligned and from the looks of it was jammed by force through the machine. This has caused many problems. Most annoying of which causes the entire machine to be off balance so assembling the machine was a nightmare because nothing else could fit right and needed extreme pressure in some circumstances to screw things together. How do I know that the company sent out a defective product that they knew was defective? Great question! Well the lid that covers the machinery is held together by 5 screws (1 on each side and 3 in the front) all 4 of the other screws are just simply screwed into the lid as they should be. However, on the side that was broken the company put a brace or a stint in the screw that holds it together because without it it wouldn't go in at all. This causes the entire right side of the machine to buckle and now and not stay together. If you lift the machine up in its storage function you can see a giant crack down the base of the machine where it was broken.  And the inside of the machine where the bolt was forcibly jammed had 6 pieces of broken plastic just sitting in a pile I don't even know where they came from.2. Due to problem 1 in order for me to stand on the machine at all I have to use wooden blocks to that it is balanced. It doesn't make me, a pregnant person feel safe? It makes me extremely sad because I feel like I'm in prison and I have no way to move around in my tiny apartment and I had to wait a month for this almost 800$ machine that I had to pay for on unemployment to arrive broken.3. I'm trying to be optimistic, I'm trying to keep the moral alive. I want to use this machine even though it's broken, because even though I ordered front door delivery Amazon wouldn't bring it up the 3 flights of stairs to my apartment and I'm pregnant and I could have miscarried walking this over 2 thousand pound box. I don't want to return it because I spent 7 hours putting it together. So I'm trying to find a way to use it because I need this happiness I need the seritonin from walking. And I can't even use the machine because the belt won't stay on straight it slides to one side after 4 or 5 steps and I'm only using it at speed 2.3. What a joke ð¤¡ ð© and yes I did look up online how to adjust the belt but it only helps adjust the sliding of the belt for about 20 seconds and it just moves right over again.I'm so sad and depressed over this. I waited for a while to have this. It took so much effort to move up the stairs and put together. My husband had to go to the doctor because he threw his back out trying to get this up the stairs alone. I can't believe you sent this product to us defective from the get go. I really hope you fix this problem Amazon.

    Great treadmill! (Bypass monthly subscription)
  
",5.0,KCReader,"Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2019","









  
  
    
  Bought this about six months ago and LOVE it! I assembled it myself and it probably took a few hours, but it can be done with one person, although it would be easier with two. Also, the instructions claim that the treadmill is ""locked"" and must be ""registered"" and when you go to register it, they'll insist that you sign up for a monthly subscription program with various workouts, etc, for an additional monthly cost. I didn't want this, so I contacted them and learned that if you turn on the treadmill and hold down on the ifit button for 20 seconds, it'll unlock your treadmill and you can use freely. Enjoy!

    T6.5S Good all around tread mill, up to 10 mph, large size. Great for Covid-19 excercise indoors.
  
",4.0,Batman W,"Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2020","Tread mill isn't the top of the line, but works for those who want to run or walk briskly. If you have never used a treadmill before, I would caution you to get used to one before you buy. It feels different running on a treadmill than it does running outside. Some people get dizzy using a treadmill, like my wife did.

Like all treadmills, if you run, the landing of your feet on the treadmill is noisy. We set it up upstairs, but ended up moving it to the basement because of this.

Being able to raise the treadmill base up right is a nice feature as it gets 1/2 of the treadmill out of the way when not in use. It is a long base, so does stick up about 6 feet in the air. The mechanism for lowering is nice as you can just let it go, and it will fall at a slow rate, and then goes very slow at about about 2 feet from the ground.

Mine came damaged. The box didn't look too bad when I got it but the plastic front for the motor/electronic cover was cracked. Took awhile to get the bottom and top cover replacement parts due to Covid-19. I was able to use the treadmill until the new parts arrived. The bottom motor pan is not for the faint of heart to replace. You have to remove 3 connectors that are pressure fit into the cover. You have to remove some wires, and remember where they went when you put the new pan on. 2 screws require you to tip the treadmill over to get at them. The packaging is robust EXCEPT for the front of the base where the plastic cover is. The manufacturer could use some better packaging here.

The box with everything in it is extremely heavy. We ended up unpacking the box outside and moving in the pieces (with Covid-19, delivery would not bring inside. This was a warning given when purchased.) Even still the motor-tread-mill-base is not a one person job to move. Assembly takes awhile. Some of the screws are hard to get at. You need 2 people to put the upright display-stand onto the base.

The display is too bright for me, but a ""Dim it"" sheet did the trick (see picture)

The manufacturer wants you to use the online registration to enable the ""custom"" workout features on the treadmill. Your first year is free, but after that you need to pay. I bypassed this by holding down the ""IFit"" button for 15 seconds (not documented anywhere, but found other reviewers who discovered this). None of the 20 programmed workouts, work when you do this, but I have always been a straight-run-for 30 minutes at a constant pace and constant incline person. The treadmill has nice 1 to 10 mph buttons so you can adjust course speed, then get your 10ths of an mph for fine tuning with the +/- buttons.

The heart rate monitor does not work for me. It always reads way low and takes a long time to get a reading (by holding the handles on the top console). This is typical in my experience with treadmills, getting a good heart rate with the hand holds provided is always hit or miss, even on expensive treadmills. I use my Garmin 605 watch and heart rate strap when I want to monitor my heart rate.

The display features are busy. It is hard to see progress of your run with the bar graph that is trying to look 3D. I ignore it now.

You cannot enter your weight so the calories expended I assume is based on a constant weight. For me 175lbs, the calories seem higher compared to more expensive treadmills I have used in gyms.

The documentation requires you to use a UL 1449 Transient Voltage Surge Suppressor, 450 joules or more, 400 volt or less compliant power strip (15 amp). I could find only one power strip that said on Amazon that it was UL 1449 complaint. I suspect most are, but Amazon does not put a lot of info on their pages about the products they sell. The manual says injury could occur if you don't use the correct Suppressor, but they don't say what could happen if you don't: electrocuted? explosion? fire? They really need to give you a link to some suppressors that they know are compliant. This was another $24.

They also recommend a mat. I got a 60"" which isn't long enough. Get a 72"". Another $31.

Has an Aux input for your ""Ipod"" and 2 speakers. I have never used these as I use ear buds when running so as not to disturb the rest of the family.

All in all, for the price I paid, it works great. Not the low end that breaks or suddenly halts when you go too fast, but not the extremely robust gym style treadmills ($2000+)

Some reviewers say they have trouble with the surge suppressor or breaker tripping. I didn't have any trouble like this. Others say the belt slips. After 5 months of use, I have no issues like this.

First Pic: ""IFit"" button. 2nd: ""20 Workouts"" button that does nothing unless you register. 3rd: Display with ""Dimm It"" sheet peeled back to see the difference. 4th: Surge protector I bought on Amazon is a Tripp Lite surge protector, 2160 joules. 5th: Treadmill raised up.",Display Size: 5 InchesStyle Name: T 6.5 S Treadmill + 1-Month iFit Membership

  This unit is very heavy and bringing it into the house required a lot of (dangerous) lifting In our case it went downstairs. (My son helped) The instructions for me at 70 were difficult in so that the screw sizes are used in multiple places and exact placement is necessary to avoid disassembly which happened three times. The multiple warnings that I had to register at iFit as the unit was locked until I did were crazy as I did not choose to buy iFit.  It is about 15/month after ""free"" MONTH. The unit looks and feels sturdy now that four hours were spent on assembly some my fault as I disassembled/assembled a few times to get it right. I am hoping that it will last a number of years. I will update if it does not if the treadmill does not outlasts me.

  I bought this on a Prime Day deal and loved the price.Delivery promised 9am to noon, and will call 30 minutes before arriving.No message or sightings by 1pm and I went on an errand, upon return several hours later found it on my front porch.  Never got a message.  So I had to recruit some help to get this down the basement (the package is well over 200#).Unpacking and assembly is straightforward.  If you have basic mechanical skills, you're good to go.Tried to start it up, completely dead.  Customer phone line not open on Sunday.  Customer internet chat looks like a bot and unable to provide any help.  Next day, ""we're experiencing a much higher than normal call volume, please hold"".  Eventually told to remove the motor cover panel.There it is...the multi pin connector to the motor control board was never plugged in.  Unlikely that it came loose in shipping because it has a latch to hold it together once it's attached.  We're good to go.As for the treadmill, it does everything I want for walking 4mph on 1 degree incline, and it's much quieter and softer than the 20 yr old one this replaced.  For 479 bucks I'd say it's a really good value in treadmills.  I'm not using the iFit workout stuff at all, but you activate one time initially with the blue button and it starts up right away every time without doing anything more than putting on the key like any other treadmill.

He had it up and running in less than an hour.  You have to put together the console & handles. It weighs too much to lift.Now that it's up I use it everyday.  I bypasses the ifit trial...I probably could have found a smaller simpler treadmill but this is pretty quiet, except my feet landing.  I'm going for sitting in the morning to walking while listening to stuff or reading.  It will be awile before I run on it.  I love the incline.  It's enough to add interest and difficulty.At $700 price point...I'm happy.

  This item started off good-met my basic needs for a treadmill. I'm a pretty lightweight guy, so I didn't need anything particularly sturdy.However, a little less than a year later, this treadmill stopped working properly. The belt did not stay in place correctly and began to tear as it rubbed against the side of the machine. The machine is on a level surface in the basement and has a mat underneath it. It is regularly taken care of and kept in a child-free, pet-free home. It isn't used daily and is used by a 130 lb male. There is no reason for it to have deteriorated this quickly. Nordictrack is unwilling to fix the issue-unless I pay $160+parts...which makes little sense for a $500 machine.Don't waste your money on this cheap item-pay a couple hundred more for an item that will last longer and ultimately save you money on maintenance.

  Treadmill would probably be OK if it would work as expected.This treadmill was delivered on December 30 and assembled on January 3. The incline would not work.You can only walk at level zero.FIRST-AMAZON Customer service has been amazing. When I could not reach Nordic track through their customer service number I used option on Amazon website to help with troubleshooting issues. Amazon was able to cut through all the red tape and wait time on a phone tree with Nordic track. The Amazon rep did the waiting and called me back once a live person was on the phone. What a difference! When I had tried to call Nordic track, all I got was a phone tree and recording that said if I was having mechanical issues I had to have the motor assembly cover already removed before they would even help (Iâm not doing that).NORDICTRACK - most all exercise machines now come with a option to join iFit, which is a subscription service for personal work outs. I donât know if this is just Nordic track, but you cannot even start your machine until you sign up for iFit. once your iFit account is activated it will send a signal to the machine and it will unlock. For me, it was about 30 minutes before I could turn on the treadmill. Basically youâre being blackmailed to sign up whether you want iFit or not.  On the iFit website there is no option that says I do not wish to join; I just kept pushing through the screens. Once you get to the screen thatâs asking for how many months you want to join and payment information just donât select anything (again there is no option for âNo thanksâ).  No incline.  Once I was able to speak with a representative at Nordic track the representative did some troubleshooting over the phone and ordered two parts that should repair the machine under warranty and that the repair rep would contact me within a week on delivery. Nordic track said that they would be tracking those shipments and a repair technician will be in contact me once they were delivered. I gave them five days and had to reach out to Nordic track again. It would be another week before the repair person could get here. The repair technician was at my home on February 4, and installed the parts that have been ordered. The technician told  me there were some bad wiring on the motor and replaced it. However that did not fix the incline. The console also has electrical issues and does not send the signal to the motor to engage the incline. Additional parts were ordered, and nordic track now tells me that the console is on back order for another 2 to 3 weeks!  Iâm really wondering how long this machine is going to last because it seems like the whole thing has a lot of electrical issues. I have asked Nordic track to simply replace the machine but Iâm now outside of the 30 day return window.  Iâm trying to be optimistic that once all repairs are made I will basically have a whole new machine but I wonât buy nordicctrack again and cannot recommend.

  I run usually 4-5x/week, and I usually run 3-5 miles per run. However, in the past I have gone up to 9 miles on this treadmill. I am a male, 190lbs and about 6'0 -- so not huge, but not small, either.  This treadmill is amazing. It's solidly built, runs well, and is dependable. To be honest, I bought one, used it for a year, sold it when I moved to a different house, and thought I would try a cheaper treadmill. Within two weeks, I sold the new one and bought myself ANOTHER one of these T Series - they're THAT good! Absolutely worth the few extra bucks over the cheaper $200-$200 models.  Overall, I can't rate this high enough, and I recommend it to anyone who just wants a good treadmill that's going to just work!

  I'm hoping both Amazon and Nordictrack takes the time to read this review. I needed a treadmill for home and ordered the Nordictrack T 6.5 S. I thought it was a good deal and it's a Nordictrack -- a well known and reputative brand name. That was my first mistake. After waiting 10 days for delivery, the box arrived damaged. The shipper assured me it's just the cardboard and shouldn't be any issues. Why Nordictrack would package a 200+ pound treadmill in a flimsy cardboard box was beyond anything I've seen before. Upon opening the box (and I took photos of everything), most of the styrofoam was broken. Not a good sign. I found one small plastic piece broken and snapped off...from something. I started to assemble the treadmill and literally found most of the hardware impossible to screw into the parts -- metal going into metal. Some bad screw hole locations, which made it extremely difficult to even start the bolt by hand. On Step 3 of the instructions (Step 1 was registering the product online and Step 2 was fishing a cable through one of the uprights with a very long twist tie cord), the ground screw wouldn't go in, no matter how much effort and pressure I put into it. The screw wouldn't fit. I had to go into my private hardware stash and find a more appropriate screw, which somewhat worked. Upon installing the left and right uprights (which took way too long than it should've due to the hardware and hole locations), the manufacturer had 4 screws in the handles, in holes that were supposed to be removed and discarded. One screw snapped upon trying to remove. Another screw wouldn't come out at all cause there wasn't enough clearance for the head (I have no idea how they put that screw in the first place -- most likely crooked and at an angle). I managed to removed 2 of the 4 screws. When I was examining the suggested hardware to attach the control console to the uprights, the provided screws wouldn't go into the holes whatsoever. Remind you, all of this is intended to be installed by hand and not with power tools. Nonetheless, I tried a power tool to see if these screws would go into the metal ports, and they wouldn't go in. The holes were machined way too small for the screws. The console itself had screws put in from the manufacturer that needed to be discarded and replaced with provided hardware. At this point, I gave up. The treadmill is seriously flawed and required custom drilling and/or different hardware than what was provided. I didn't even get half way through the instructions, much of the hardware was still sealed, but I was done with this mess and initiated a return online with a few grueling phone calls with Amazon representatives, who didn't speak clear English and was completely unhelpful.I consider myself very good with assembling these type of things, electronics, furniture, systems, etc., but I couldn't believe how poorly engineered and manufactured this treadmill was. Parts alone didn't fit well together. I was also completely shocked it bared the Nordictrack name on it, as I believed them to provide high quality products. Sadly, this treadmill was far from that, if not the worst piece of equipment I've ever had to assemble in my entire life.The repackaging for the return was another disaster, but after strain and sprains, I was able to successfully disassemble what I managed to assemble initially, repackage, lift a 200+ pound box and carefully shrink wrap it. It's ready to be picked up and looks far better now than when it was delivered. I have a 5 day wait for them to get it. Meanwhile, this huge awkward box sits in my livingroom near the front door.Nordictrack failed hugely on this mess of a treadmill. It's quality control and engineering is a disaster. I still need a treadmill and now will have to wait for this return and refund to offset my funds before buying a different brand.Extremely disappointed all around with this experience!

  I had a super old treadmill that was given to me and it finally wore out. I am a ""wogger"" so didn't need anything super fancy.  The controls are easy to use, the running surface has plenty of room front to back and side to side. It's easy to fold up and easy to lower. There's hydraulics so you aren't having to lower and worry about dropping the platform as it comes down. I love the lip on the face to set my phone or ipad on to keep me entertained. My only small complaint, but it's minor is that the side rails are pretty fat and not great for small hands, can't get a good grip on them but just took some getting used to. Also noteworthy, when you hit the stop button, it stops pretty quick so either hop off and hit stop or have it at a slow speed and hit stop. Very happy I purchased this treadmill!

  We researched over 50 treadmills suited for an at-home beginner.  We paid for the assembly technician.  The product arrived on schedule from Nordic Trac.  and the Amazon.com assembly arrived on time with tools in hand and seemed very competent.  The problem was, we live in an apartment and the item was delivered to the front door.  He was able to bring the treadmill in the house and fortunately, there was a construction crew next door who helped him bring in into the office where we wanted it.  The problem occurred soon after when he discovered Nordic Trac sent two left-arm rails, rather than a left and a right.  He had to leave.  I had to register the treadmill with Nordic Trac, chat with their customer service and get a replacement right arm rail and then reschedule the assembly.  While everyone did their job in getting everything fixed, it's a shame so many people had to spend so much time fixing something one person in the warehouse caused by not paying attention to what is called the ""pick list"" when putting parts in a box.UPDATE: Nordic Trac sent a replacement part for the missing right arm.  It was not the right part.  I had to contact them and start the replacement part all over again.  The second ""right arm"" arrived and is was also the wrong one.  I examined the part and saw that it would fit into the panel display even though it was longer than the left arm and did not come with the silicon arm sleeve as the left ones did.The assembly tech came out as scheduled and I just hope he could make it work.  He did.  He removed the silicon sweat cover from the extra left arm that was originally in the box, put it on the right arm which was too long.  My machine is FINALLY up and running thanks to the cleverness of the assembly tech.  No thanks to Nordic trac.  No fault of Amazon.com.  My right handrail is installed, has the silicon sleeve on it and it just 4 or 5 inches longer than the left hand rail and the right hand rail is not completely covered by the silicon sleeve.  I could have started round three with Nordic trac, but I ran out of steam and threw my hands up.

  Overall seems like a great treadmill for the price. Has everything I need and none of the junk I don't. Love the ""speed dial"" buttons to quickly set a preset speed and get going immediately without having to tap an inordinate number of touchscreen controls. Assembly requires two people.Why it's not 5 stars:1. The silver screw was damaged on delivery. Based on reviews/comments it seems others have also had this issue. Contacted NordicTrack and waiting for a response. Meanwhile, using screw that was originally screwed in.2. iFit activation could not be bypassed on this model (maybe it's been updated) but there's a free trial with no commitment and manual mode can continue to be used afterwards. Still, would have been ideal to be able to use the treadmill with no activation.3. There is no perfect place to put my phone on this treadmill. The cupholders are large but not in a way where I can place my phone flat, which seems to exacerbate the rattling of my phone during a run.4. A top speed higher than 10 mph would have been nice.5. There doesn't seem to be a way to set weight, resulting in an inaccurate calories burned count.

  I like to run outside but when the weather is bad or I'm on-call for work its nice to get my workout at home so I can quickly grab my things and go. I wanted to stick with a reputable brand so I checked out Nordick Track. Based on my running I thought the T6.5 would work perfectly.Price was OK, assembly was fine, folds easily enough. I bought the 1 year service plan. Not long into having it, all the issues started. Not being a treadmill technician i wasn't sure what was going on but the display was not controlling the speed/incline. I worked with a Nordick Track and they determined it was a computer board issue. They refused to send a technician but did send a new computer board. After installing, the treadmill didnt work right. A few more back and forth phone calls and the Nordic Track tech now says its the motor, so they sent a new motor (again- wouldn't send a technician). After installing the new motor it still didn't work right.I didnt have time to be on the phone all day to figure out the issues so the treadmill sat collecting dust. Then the ""your warranty is expiring"" calls started. I explained my situation and nothing ever came of it. Eventually the emails and phone calls stopped.Not the best experience- try another Brand.

HOWEVER, after owning the Nordicktrack for 15 months, the running plate under the belt cracked while I was running. I twisted my ankle and could have hurt myself more. When I contacted the company, they are refusing to stand behind the product. They are telling me that I should have bought an extended warranty WHEN IT IS MARKETED AS A THREE YEAR PARTS WARRANTY. That seems like a bait and switch to me. I keep reaching out the the company but they refuse to do the right thing. Buyer beware!

    Excellent Treadmill for tall people
  
",5.0,Ross,"Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  My husband and I are both tall people (5'10"", 6'3"" respectively) and I big concern about purchasing a treadmill for home use was that it would be too small for our long legs. We researched, read hundreds of reviews and bit the bullet. We could not be happier with this treadmill. It's a good size for the home but is still plenty long enough for a full stride. It folds up well and takes up minimal space when not in use. Overall, an excellent machine and one we both would recommend.

  They treadmill is locked and can not be used until you sign up for their silly app, the app is laggy and worthless. The installation instruction are ok but fail to mention to put on the covers on the posts before installing them, you won't know this until the end when it would require dismantling the whole thing to put the covers on.  Once you get it working its ok up to 7mph, past that if you step wrong it feels too wobbly for me (210 lb) . The cover upfront is too close to your feet when you are running as well, so if you like being close to the handles when you run your are going to step on the cover and that's also unsafe imo.  Over all its ok for the price, and perfect if you will be doing light running at lower speeds, and it's just barely acceptable if you are doing any sort of medium intensity running. Anything serious I would look somewhere else.

    Awful support from NordicTrack when there is manufacture defect!!!
  
",2.0,KwongAMZ,"Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  A bit too much weak plastic so the plastic tends to be broken. Biggest issue is there is no suppot from NordicTrack. They use ICON company in their warranty and I emailed to reach out to them 2x so far. No response! My treadmill is left broken. One of the screw at the rear that meant to attack the platform to the rear plastic is broken. The screw is screwed in some plastic where the plastic broke off completely. So when I run the plastic vibrate and bang against each other making load noises. I also read from Facebook NordicTrack page that they barely reply and also no parts to fix. So don't even bother with purchasing warranty. Matter of fact, stay away from NordicTrack and get a Peloton if you like to avoid unsatisfied customer support.

  The treadmill was relatively easy to assemble, but to my chagrin the unit does not work.  All the displays work, set time and date etc.  but the belt motor and incline motor do not operate.  Working with Nautilus to try and get something working, they are sending parts as problem is diagnosed.  First attempt was to send a third party tech to work on it, but that fell through after two weeks.  Getting more parts and will replace them myself.  It looks good but this problem is REALLY ANNOYING.

  Well the item arrived earlier then expected and I felt this was a positive sign. However assembly was much harder then expected. Screws do not line up accurately so I spent half an hour just getting the control mounted. After assembly I proceeded to activate the machine. The instructions for this are not real clear. Once activated I found out the machine has a bad mainboard so it doesn't work at all. Called the customer service spent half a day troubleshooting and now I'm waiting on a new main board. I can only hope this works once installed. The shipping box is gone so shipping it back is not possible.  The entire experience frankly has left me with a bad taste for nordic track products. Lots of hype and glitz but inferior products. Wont make this mistake again. Its probably a thousand dollars down the drain.

    Horrible experience from start to finish
  
",1.0,Satisfied Customer ,"Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  We purchased treadmill, not understanding that a 2.6 hp won't handle repeated heavy running sessions. It will only handle light walking and maybe jogging or not depending on how much you weigh. That was not clearly presented in the ad (this was first issue). The two guys that delivered it were very big men and could barely get it upstairs, it was that heavy. We finally got an ""assembly"" person to come out today (DO NOT GO WITH AMAZON HOME SERVICES)!!! You need to have two people do the assembly. The guy that was sent out was rude and nasty, snapping at us, could barely stand and his hands shook violently. He got out a razorblade (we don't know why, as he had finished cutting the ties with scissors), and then he cut his finger. There was blood and I went to get a bandaid, and after he lost a screw and could barely screw in the post, I asked him politely to leave. He became argumentative and demanded to know why. I finally had to threaten to call the police. It was a horrible experience and we are returning the item after making numerous attempts to resolve the situation and get two people out here to assembly, which home services does not understand is needed or the item (to safely hold and support while the other person threads and connects).  I hope this helps others.

    An assembly nightmare...but it works
  
",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  This thing was a nightmare to assemble! There simply must be a better way to package this thing! You most definitely need two people (maybe even three) and you have to spend a good bit of time deciphering the instructions. (I still donât know what all the numbers are for associated with the parts.) Go ahead and pay extra for assembly if you can! However, once assembled, it is a decent treadmill and gets the job done. Our unit has an inaccurate heart rate sensor, but it is not important for us to have this feature in the treadmill itself. Everything else seems to work fine.Our only âcomplaintâ is that the âupâ position for this treadmill leaves it leaning quite a bit on a short hydraulic bar. This is very different from other treadmills we have had that raised up completely and then locked in place. It seems to be steady, but the look of it leaning makes us a little uneasy and worried it might fall. However, there havenât been any functional problems with it and it does let down nice and smoothly.About the iFit lock: Other reviews are correct. You can hold down the iFit button for thirty seconds to bypass the lock with no problem at all. Your treadmill will then start right up. There is no need to sign up for iFit if you donât want that service.

  I've been using treadmills for the past 20 year, this is my 3rd one in that time. I was hesitant to purchase this because it was a tad under 700 dollars and I'm used to paying at least a grand. I figured it would be flimsy but I was way wrong. This treadmill so far (after 2 months) is rock solid. The wife and I have been using it in total for 2 hours a day 6 days a week.Assembly:I have to be honest, the assembly was a little bit tough but if you get stuck just walk away for a few minutes and come back with a clear head. Some of the bolts and screws were really hard to start off but just take your time, also use some WD40. I love that this treadmill uses real bolts for the main connection points (arms attaching to base), my last treadmill used bolts that you needed an allen key to tighten and of course we all know those strip after a while.First Use:Of course we all know from previous reviews to bypass iFit hold down the iFit button for 20 seconds WITH THE SAFETY KEY PLUGGED IN. During the first use I noticed it was really noisy, not clanking but when you walked on the belt it was making a swishing noise. I called NordicTrack and after some troubleshooting I found my belt was too tight, you should be able to lift the belt at the center 3 inches or so. I loosened the belt and the noise definitely got better. The NordicTrack person heard the swishing and send me some lube which fixed the problem.I was hesitant because it only has a 2.6HP motor but it really is solid. I notice no whining when increasing speed, it takes right off.Overall I love this treadmill and learned that you don't have to pay over a grand to get a quality treadmill.

  So far, so good. My husband and I set this up in a little less than an hour. There are a lot of reviews that reference being duped into paying for ifit, but I think they must be doing something wrong. This treadmill came with a card that has a code for a year of free ifit membership. I followed the very clearly laid out instructions and had no problem. I am using the membership now and was not charged. I will be charged for another year once this year is up if I don't cancel in time. Cancellation instructions also seem really clear. You just have to read.Other than that, I really like that you can quickly select a change in speed on the right side of the panel.  I was not expecting that to make any difference for me, but I'm realizing it's way better than sitting there and holding down a button when going between sprinting and walking.  The treadmill is relatively quiet and the display is great.  It's a little slow to load when initially turned on and when going between programs, but I have not had any lagging problems in the middle of workouts.  So far, no complaints.

  This is NordicTrack product but it's locked by iFit?  It's not only very challenging to activate, it's very not user friendly - Grandma or Grandpa for sure cannot operate.  Below are issues I had with this product:1) Delivery: Amazon took forever to deliver the product - it was delivered 1+ weeks later.2) The plastic cover with NordicTrack Logo was cracked!3) Installation: #10 metal screw that holds the handle bar does not fit - supposed to be #8 metal screw instead.  I had to buy #8 screw from Home Depot to get the job done.  AND 1.25 inch length is not okay, 1.5 inch is correct spec.4) Activation: Unless you login and activate through iFit, it will not start.  Not sure why NordicTrack did this...this is very bad user experience - certainly a BIG pain in the butt.  AND it's not straight forward either....5) Usage: after activation treadmill started but when you ""STOP"" you can't ""START"" unless it's turn-off - very annoying.  I suspect it has something to do with iFIT activation/synchronization.6) In summary:  Not sure why I can't plug-in and enjoy my treadmill after long tedious installation without going through iFit/activation.  For sure it wasn't my best Amazon delivery experience.7) I will not recommend this product due to many installation and activation related issues.

  I tried the free 30 day trial for iFit out of curiosity and have fully bought into the program. There's more than just running or walking in the app....also strength training, HIIT and yoga/pilates. The treadmill was easy to assemble by the instructions. I only needed help holding it up for me to put the storage bar in, as expected in the instructions and the other reviews.  Very smooth motors for incline and speed progression, great machine. Delivery was via a box truck and he helped push it into the house even though he couldn't enter due to COVID. When I called to confirm delivery dates they even gave me the option to move my delivery date up which I jumped on. Great money saver in this unit if you already have a tablet to run ifit on if you're going to use that feature.

",4.0,Ardie C.,"Reviewed in the United States March 18, 2021","









  
  
    
  I hate exercise with a white hot passion, but Iâm ok with walking. I got this treadmill because I wasnât getting in enough steps since covid hit as Iâve been teleworking. I did my research and this one fit my budget, and independent reviews were good.The instructions said it would take two people about two hours to set it up. This is accurate.Initial operation was easy, I just logged into the website, entered the particulars and off I went.My iPad easily connected via Bluetooth, so Iâve been using the iFit program. Iâm not a fan of listening to a trainer yelling at me so I go along on the walks and listen to music or podcasts. The progressively more difficult programs work very well.I have a small house, and while the treadmill isnât small, it fit into a small room. Folding it up us easy although rarely necessary.The varying incline adds a nice dimension to my workouts, if the walk is flat, sometimes Iâll increase the incline to make the workout more effective. Similarly, if the walk is too slow I can increase the speed.This is very good for people who are out of shape who want to do something about it. Iâve only missed a couple days since I received it in early January, and unlike most workouts, Iâm sticking with it.A friend ordered one on my recommendation so I have a sort of virtual âwork out buddyâ, and we recommend workouts to each other.  Itâs surfy, relatively quiet, and I havenât had any problems with it thus far.My only issue isnât the treadmill, but the delivery. I paid a bit extra for delivery âto a roomâ.  It was left on a pallet in my garage, which isnât âa roomâ.  It weighs 200 pounds, so it isnât like you can just haul it into the house. Make sure you have someone who can help you get it where you want it.

  Dislikes: Too many little screws during assembly! Auto makers learned the lesson of build it in, don't tack it on years ago. The instructions tell you to run the wire for the screen through the bottom- wrong! The hole the wire is secured to with a screw about 2 inches from the bottom of the inside upright during shipping is the hole for the wiring. During operation the undercarriage squeaks alot, like an old car needing a lube job. There were two plastic covers for the bottom of the uprights that had holes predrilled for screws, but didn't come with any. They just rest on top of the inside uprights loosely.Likes: the motor is fairly quiet. I'm glad I got the bigger belt size, both length and width. It helps keep you centered should you misstep. The software did require a credit card to use, supposedly if you cancel before renewal you get a credit. I wasn't able to find a training video that went more than about 55 minutes max, playing the same route over and over until you reach your time limit is not optimal and would require you to restart which means stopping in the middle of your workout. Being able to que a couple videos to start when one ends would be better. Why not provide an HDMI output so people can connect to their tv's??? That dinky little screen is for the birds. I only used the machine for about 3 weeks till the good weather broke(and the Covid outbreak had leveled off) but will use it on rainy days and when the cold weather comes again so I can't speak to longevity or durability but I did purchase the 3 year extended warranty just in case. Overall initial quality feels good.

After talking with the Nordic track Help desk (took 2+hours to get to a live person/ chat was just as bad), they quickly identified that the motor control board fried due to an update they sent out.  It doesn't happen on all treadmills but IT'S A KNOWN ISSUE THATS BEEN AROUND FOR MONTHS (they were debating on issuing a recall).  It sounds like my ""NEW"" treadmill tried to apply the update and it fried the control board.  2-3 weeks for a replacement part to be sent out (backordered)!UPDATE:After 2+ weeks, the replacement Motor Control Board arrived and it was DOA.  The Vendor is clueless and there warranty is Useless.  Additionally, the 3 year extended warranty was useless because ""the fine print"" indicates that they don't cover any defects that the manufacturer should cover.....Nordic Track customer service (phone or chat) is UNDER STAFFED; to give you an idea of how under staffed they are; their online CHAT service has a 11 hour and 23 minute wait.  I could understand the issue if this was Month 1 of Covid; however, this is an online service and this is NOT month 1 of Covid.

    Poor manufacturing
  
",2.0,Marjorie L.,"Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2021","









  
  
    
  Assembly was annoying but not terrible.  The engineering design and manufacturing of the treadmill is poor at best.After assembly we attempted to log onto the ifit website to register and unlock the treadmill.  The web page keeps reverting back to Canada while we live in the US so we were unable to register.  Was not using a VPN.  If this happens to you, hold down the ifit sync button for about 15 seconds and the machine will enable.  Once the machine was on we started the motor and...nothing.  I could hear the motor running but the belt was not moving.  Pulled the front cover off (your toes point to it while running) by removing 6 small screws to access the motor and discovered that the belt was not tensioned properly as seen in the pic.  ALSO, and more importantly, the motor sits at about a 5-10 degree angle to the tread belt arbor (pic 2).  This will cause the belt to prematurely wear and potentially create thrust against the bearings causing them to fail.  The bracket that holds the motor to the frame is welded so there is no way to rotate the motor around the Z axis on the X plane.This machine seems to be designed with planned engineered obsolescence to ensure that it fails at a expedited rate.

    Review after Owning for Two Months
  
",2.0,melissa,"Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2019","









  
  
    
  I decided to wait a few months to write a review. I've had this treadmill for about 2 months now and I feel I can give an adequate review (for quick review--go to bottom):The treadmill itself is nice. However, it has a weird feeling under-foot that I have never experienced on commercial treadmills before. Almost as if you can feel the belt rubbing against the surface of the machine as you put pressure from your feet down. Annoying? Yes. Does it affect the workout? Not really. Just a minor agitation in sound and in the feeling for the first few rounds. Going under 2.8 speed makes it almost unbearable though. Running on it is nice. It has a nice bounce so I don't feel like my knees are dying quite as badly.The biggest frustration is the ifit program. I find ifit to be the most annoying app to work with. I like treadmills to have the pre-programmed training exercises so that I can do a good incline workout without having to figure out the incline myself. iFit only offers fitness trainers directing your workout which also triggers the speed. I am okay with a random unknown incline. I am not okay with watching tv and all of the sudden my treadmill is pushing 5mph when I was hoping for a brisk walk.Overall...the treadmill isn't bad, but the program in it is. So, unless you want to be bound to either always manually adjusting speed and inclines or having a trainer have full control of what you're doing...I'd go with something different. I do warn that I've noticed a LOT of treadmills have the ifit program so I'd check that first.Simplified version:Pros:-Treadmill is sturdy-Touch screen is well lit and has good response-Incline and Speed very easy to useCons:-belt feels like its dragging - especially under 2.8 speeds-iFit is awful-the manual option is very limited-No pre-programmed workouts that don't involve an annoying trainerOverall: I think the price is way too much for how strict it is with the iFit program and Google Maps is pretty lacking. A regular treadmill could get the job done a lot better and would probably cost around $1000.

  I purchased this treadmill for home use. I'm not a super avid runner, and I only usually go as fast as 6.0, but this treadmill does go up to 10 for both incline and speed. I was worried at first that the belt was a little narrow, but after running several times on it I have had no problems. The buttons are responsive and the belt speed is accurate. The heart monitor, as they usually are, does not appear to be super accurate, but I don't rely on the built in one on the treadmill anyway. It does also come with built in workouts, which I haven't yet explored as I mostly use this for running and rucking. When you purchase this, it does try to make you feel like you have to sign up for the iFit trial - you do not have to do that! If you simply hold the down the iFit button on the console, it will let you bypass that. Finally, this treadmill is a beast to put together. The housings for the bolts are not great, and often you have to torque the bolts pretty hard to get them in. It took my husband and I about three hours to fully assemble. I would recommend having a marriage counsellor on call if you want to make it through the assembly phase still happily married. Seriously, it was incredibly difficult, and the treadmill is remarkably heavy to boot. However, I still rate this little beauty five stars, because the performance of the machine has been stellar.  I would highly recommend.

    Followup to my assembly issues

  I've upped my stars from 3 to 4 now that I've used it a few times. It works well with just a few caveats. I had to adjust the belt again on my first usage which I did and it now seems to track pretty good (note that the adjustment turn is the opposite of what is described in the manual). The only other issue is the built in heart beat monitor. Its sketchy at best but I'm comparing it to the $6000 cardiac unit I had been using. I will investigate the chest monitor from Nordic Track to see if it might be more accurate. Lastly, the incline does not retract when its stopped so if you don't want to damage the unit when its lifted out of the way, one needs to remember to set the incline to 0!

  As mentioned in a review earlier  you do not need to sign up for Ifit. Just hold down the ifit sync button for 30 seconds and it works fine!It was easy to put together with 2 people, I should have read the instructions instead of my husband because we made it all the way to the end and realized we never put the protective covers on the front legs... whatever not the end of the world.Works great! I purchased a mat to go under the treadmill however if you are planning to use it at full incline the mat scrunch up under it. So we may take it out from under the treadmill.All in all I'm extremely happy with my purchase!

  Got it today and I am in love! Exactly what I was looking for! Itâs sturdy, the incline is great and the speed. Itâs pretty quite and comfortable walking on it. It does cushion nicely on walking and running. This treadmill is close to what you will find in a gym. Believe it or not but my 12 year old son put it all together!!! Took about 3 hrs so plan for some time. Thanks to another reviewer on here, you CAN use the treadmill without subscribing to iFit. The package and the stickers said the treadmill is locked and you need to register and subscribe but thatâs not true! I turned it on and held the iFit button down for over 10 sec. And it worked. Now all I do is turn the switch on and start my work out. I would say the only negative item so far is that the on/off button is so far down, but thatâs really all I can complain about it! Delivery was fast and it came in one piece and not damaged. Since it is quite heavy, if you donât have muscle and a heavy duty cart you might want to opt for indoor delivery.

    Won't power on after 6 months and nordic track did not honor warranty
  
",1.0,Tinman024,"Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've had the nordic track for 6 months and I tried to plug my tablet into the machine and all of a sudden it went dark and it won't power on. Well I've called nordic track a few times and it's been an awful experience. The first person I talked to was quite nasty and I couldn't believe the things she was telling me over the phone. She asked me if I heard about the ""maskless protesters"" in my state and called them a bunch of ""Karens"". I honestly didn't even know what to say back to her. But the good news is she did her job and mailed the part to me that I needed and gave me the number to the technician who was supposed to install it. The only problem is I cannot reach the technician. I have been trying to get ahold of the technician for over 2 weeks now with no success. I've literally called him at least 10 times.  So I have called Nordic track back twice to ask them to reach out to the technician for me and they write in their notes that they will reach out but it's becoming pretty clear that I'm going to have to try and figure out how to install the LCD screen myself. The machine comes with 1 year warranty on labor and 2 year warranty on parts so to be clear, the parts warranty was honored but not the labor. It doesn't surprise me that the product failed seeing as how nordic track has weird people working for their company.

  Putting the treadmill together was difficult due to several screw holes not compatible.  After fully assembling and inspecting the treadmill, we found that there were two large cracks - one on teh back of the display assembly and one at the bottom left rear ""foot"".  We do not want to try to disassemble and return the beast but we are extremely disappointed to spend this much money to have a broken piece of machinery (and we hope the broken foot doesn't impact safety or stability).  The treadmill works well and we are happy with it's function, but having it cracked is not acceptable.

  I am extremely satisfied and proud of my decision to go ahead with the purchase of this Treadmill. It's been close to 3 months since we bought this and my teenage kids are addicted to it and haven't missed a day running on the Treadmill. They are glued to the challenging programs that i-Fit programs provide and in due course have become good long-distance runners. It's just a perfect Treadmill with a boatload of capabilities that can be tweaked for seniors, young adults, and teenage kids. I just love the engineering behind it and it doesn't make a squeak even when a heavy weight like me runs on it.The assembling took a little effort and once done it was worth it. I would recommend this Treadmill to anyone who is planning to have themselves or their kids have a good workout routine or start on a good habit of incorporating work out in to their daily life and i promise this wont disappoint you as it has done wonders to my family.

  I had difficulties with assembling treadmill in couple of areas.1. With the ground wire having self drilling screw . The given screw was not a right fit for the hole in treadmill. I had to struggle a lot to identify the correct one.2. With the hydrallic bars ; The bar had a small plastic to hold the lever inside the bar but the lever came out as soon as the plastic holder was taken off which made the alignment fall off and complicated the fixtures.As for as the treadmill is concerned, the product is good and sturdy.  I have had few walk/jog in the last few days and all the time it was perfect. Pretty good product. Overall its good but little bit of difficulty with the assembly.

    NordicTrack, best treadmill decision ever.
  
",5.0,Franklyn Nin,"Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  I love my NordicTrack treadmill. I was very sceptical and searched all around the web to find a really good machine that would fit my budget.After searching for quite some time I came across my New NordicTrack treadmill and read nothing but great things about it.First and foremost the money is worth it. Of you go for anything less than $700 to $900 on a treadmill. Most likely you are going to get a cheap device that will work for you but won't last. My NordicTrack T series 6.5 has sensors for you to place your hands and see your heart rate like you do at the gym. The same is pretty neat. It is as if I was at the gym. Not to mention I was concerned about the weight limit capacity and it is able to withstand up to 300 lbs. The width of the belt is wide enough for running. Something you can't do on other treadmills that are around the $300 range. Another thing I love is being able to fold the treadmill by raising the belt mechanism. I also have the option of connecting using a 3.5 mm jack any decive to play music to the integrated speakers the treadmill has. Another thing to love is the two empty sections it has that will allow you to place your bottle of water or thermo. It's just great.I wish it was able to connect the speakers via Bluetooth, but things like that cost more money.  I just needed a machine that would allow me to work out and get into the shape a need to stay healthy. This NordicTrack T 6.5 does exactly that. I have presets for workouts and if you are willing to pay extra for a personal coach the treadmill has the capability to connect to your account and get iFit. There is a membership involved and I read you get great workouts by subscribing. At this point I won't do this but maybe in the future I will. I am happy with my treadmill. If I had to plan on buying a treadmill again I would definitely go with NordicTrack without any regrets.Thank you NordicTrack. I hope you guys keep up the good work with your equipment.

  I didn't know that you could bypass registering the treadmill for $15.00 a month and even though I was incredibly frustrated,  it took me 4 weeks to put it together all by myself and there was no way I was sending it back. If you don't register it will literally beep at you basically torturing you until you sign up. I have yet to try the bypass or cancelling my membership but I do feel incredibly frustrated with how NordicTrack is marketing this product and forcing people to sign up  for a membership. Also, don't be further scammed and make sure that if you purchase you only pay the $600 because they like to raise the price to over $1,000 in high demand. I had to order twice and they cancelled my first order in order to sell it to someone else for a higher price.Speaking to the actual treadmill, I think that it works very well and the shock absorption makes the running experience a lot smoother than the NordicTrack that I got 15 years ago. I really enjoyed it once I got running on it but due to the bad business practices ad blatant deception, I cannot recommend that you get this product from this site.

  We have had this treadmill a week now. I have done two iFit classes every night and have been so much more motivated to use my treadmill.  This treadmill lowers and lofts very easy. The treadmill itself is very heavy when it is delivered. The treadmill is made of very durable material and is a great value if you don't care for all the tablet stuff they try selling you on these days. This one does have a spot you can place a tablet if you wish.That being said...on another note don't expect Amazon to follow their own delivery instructions. Our delivery was supposed to be delivered inside and they blocked our garage trapping me inside all day until my husband was home! Amazon basically stated they can't control what their own drivers do.

    Guided Runs and Big Display - Skeptic turned around

  I got the 8.5S with the 10in display. In my initial research, I was very skeptical about getting a 'smart' treadmill, I thought that all I need was just a mechanically sound machine and the iFit (or any other digital connectivity, online classes) doesn't worth the cost. After using the guided run/workout sessions with iFit I'm left very impressed. And I totally understand now the benefits of really large displays (like a 27in screen on Peloton Thread) - that immersive experience makes all the difference!Few small comments:- Bluetooth speakers work great, with plenty of sound volume.- Built-in fan has good airflow.- It doesn't look like it will be easy to disassemble the rails/control panel from the thread part in case you decide to move your treadmill from one floor to another. There is a cable that runs from the control panel to the motor and once you connect it during assembly, it's in it for good.

  I bought this for my wife to use but I will be using it also.. The bottom line is, I was impressed with this treadmill.It arrived on time and was moved in the house. This is a heavy unit around 200 lbs so if you are going to use it in a upstairs room I would pay the extra charge to have it delivered to a specific room. If the engineering on the treadmill is as good and the engineering  they used for the packaging it is going to be a great machine.The assembly is straight forward and very simple, I started in the afternoon and finished it the next day but it could be done in 2 hrs or less. All the parts are labeled right of left and the hardware is plastic sealed on a card with each item labeled and and what step on the instructions to use them. The instructions call for a crescent wrench but it is better to use a 1/2 inch ratchet wrench. I'm not sure it is a 1/2"" or 9/16"" but is give you more room to work to tighten the nuts.This came with one year of ifit and you can add 3 other persons to the account. It is a nice add on to use trainers and different location to run of hike. When the free time is up I will be extending the account.We have been using the treadmill for 3 weeks and the only thing that seems to be a negative it the touch screen unit is slow to boot up.I don't see how you could go wrong buying this treadmill.  Good value for the price..

  So far, this treadmill hasn't lived up to expectations. Upon opening the box, I discovered it was missing parts. The packaging is a cardboard sheet, heat sealed, so this is an issue from the manufacturer. Once I finally received the parts from the company, I realized how difficult of an assembly it truly is. Don't try to assemble this by yourself. After I finally got the treadmill assembled, it was a hassle just getting the basic ""manual"" mode on, because nothing works until you set up the ""ifit"" program. And finally, after all that, the treadmill is up and running, but it wobbles, because one side of the unit has a rubber block on the bottom and one doesn't...not part of the assembly, from the manufacturer...does it belong there or not? Still waiting on a response from the company. Overall, not a good experience. I could've gotten a lemon, but I will be very hesitant to buy a NordicTrack again.

  Have had treadmill for over a month so far and canât complain. It does what a treadmill should do. Speed goes plenty fast for my household and incline goes high enough to get a strong burn going. Of course, they donât tell you in the manual that you donât have to sign up for iFit, but it can be bypassed by holding the iFit button for 30 seconds. All stickers and indicators say you have to sign up to active the treadmill, and if itâs something youâd like to try go for it. However, donât think you have to sign up to use the treadmill. The only negative Iâve had so far is that every know and then it trips by Arc flash breaker. Iâve noticed that it usually does it if a person is standing on the belt when trying to start. If standing to the side until moving it doesnât seem to happen.

  Ordered the 8.5 after trying a less expensive treadmill from xterra. This is definitely worth the money if you are looking to make an investment in your health. Itâs first of all a great treadmill. The shock absorbers work well and itâs great to be able to fold up if necessary. The 3.5 CHP motor makes for a smooth run. The 12% incline adds a serious challenge. The iFit subscription is quite fun so far, though it remains to be seen if we will resubscribe after the free year. The fact that it can control the speed and incline is honestly really cool. I recommend the 8.5 esp because the slight increase in price over the 6.5 is worth it for the larger motor. Five stars.

    Delayed Delivery, Hard to assemble if you are not a handy man
  
",2.0,Raymund Delos Santos,"Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  First of all, I am totally DISAPPOINTED on my order because AMAZON used XPO delivery service where it took another week for me to get the order. I placed this item as PRIME order and waited for 2 weeks to get delivery which is the expected date. On July 17th, nothing came and I have to call XPO and Amazon to track where my delivery is. Amazon's excuse is that it's not their fault, but in their tracking, they are being updated by XPO and nothing shows that there was a delay nor contacted me by both parties. I had an argument with XPO and same time with Amazon customer support as they can't resolve the issue. XPO promised to deliver a week later and it came, but still late. As an AMAZON PRIME MEMBER, we shouldn't be treated this way as we are a paying member. I should get something back for the trouble AMAZON and you did nothing.Now for the treadmill, after assembly the treadmill is SOLID. I really didn't expect a BIG size of a threadmill (same size as in the gyms) and now I need to find a bigger place for it. It took me 2.5 hours to assemble as the manual is not details and crappy. I did figure out that there is a page at the back for parts with numbers to match the guide but still took me longer than expected. The holes are very tight and you need extra muscle to tighten them. When you install the left and right arm and about to install the sensor bar for the pulse, you'll see that there is a few inches GAP so you need another person to squeeze the other end to screw that bar in place. You will also need another person to install the lift bar (hydraulic) as that person needs to hold it up until you screw everything in.Nordic could have made the assembly better. I wish they had a lower model that is lighter and slimmer. Be careful moving it as it can scratch your wood floor. The weight is about 200+ lbs so if you plan to move it upstairs, Good Luck!! The wheels are too small and no wheels at front. Hard to move it The speakers are garbage and pretty much useless. That's all about it...let's see after 6 months how this thing performs with 5 people using it. I recommend the product but not XPO to deliver this item.

  My old treadmill go sick in the pandemic.  Probably wasn't covid but it was probably old age.  I saw the NordicTrack T Series Treadmill on Amazon and it seemed to fit my (simple needs).  Package arrived damaged but the treadmill largely survived.  I had some broken plastic pieces (console tray) but after minor rigamarole NordicTrac  sent me replacement parts and the installation went relatively smoothly.  For some reason one of the bolts for the arm was too short but I got another from Home Depot that sufficed.  Instructions were straightforward.  My wife helped when I needed four hands and everything worked when we fired it up.  I have used it for several weeks and have had no problems.  It is a little noisy at low speed but not so much that it is a bother.  Folds up well and is just right for my basement room. (the delivery manipulated it down smoothy and efficiently)  I bought the third party (UTS) maintenance service for three years.  NordicTrac offers their own and I am still debating whether that might be worthwhile. (Does anybody have any input?)  All in all I am satisfied and enjoying (?) the treadmill.  I am no longer an athlete and just want to have a nice workout and I think this will do the trick.

  3 of 4 screws for the cross bar do not fit making the treadmill un-usable.  See photos.  Even with the cross bar removed, these 3 screws do not fit.  It really would be easy for NordicTrack to figure out standard bolts or screws for the entire machine rather than unique screws and bolts for each section.  Be ready to find alternative screws that fit for the cross bar.Regarding the instructions, it is passable but NordicTrack should hire a person from Lego or even IKEA that knows how to write instructions.Very disappointing.

  This treadmill is professional quality but extremely heavy and difficult to maneuver. Thank heavens I had the prudence of paying extra $20 for delivery to a room of choice. I ended up giving the delivery guys another $30 as a tip...and it was completely worth it. My husbsnd is extremely handy with tools, it still took him a solid 3 hours to assemble it. We did it over multiple days. The manual booklet is 7/8 pages long. I advise watching instructional videos in you tube. Lastly the trick to bypass ifit as advised by several users came handy. Put the emergency stop key in place and keep holding the ifit logo...it will work. It is a really good treadmill hopefully the effort we put in will be worth it.

  I ordered this treadmill after the one I had for years broke.  It arrived and I had no difficulty assembling it the same day (possibly because of Covid, delivery was to the door or garage, so it took two of us to get it to the den).I used it once before I myself came down with Covid and ended up in the hospital for 11 days.  When I came out I didnât have strength or lung capacity to walk down the hall.  After a couple of weeks back at home, I start using this treadmill for recovery.  I started out slow, no incline for 20 minutes and increased 1 minute per day until I got to 30 minutes at the same time gradually increasing my max speed and incline.  I have now used it for 47 days in a row.The treadmill comes with a year family membership to iFit.  Both my daughters and I have started using it and love it.  This treadmill has a large screen and doing an iFit walking program lets you follow the trainer and see all the scenery (currently working a Costa Rica walking on program).  The program includes beach walks and mountain hikes.  The treadmill automatically adjusts speed and incline as the program starts climbing hills/mountains (max incline of 12 is higher than I want to go, but Iâve done it on this treadmill as part of the Costa Rica program).I have not fully recovered and because of lung scaring I may never get back to where I was pre-Covid, but this treadmill is helping me get there faster than I expected.

  Purchased this treadmill a few months ago on Amazon. Arrived within the expected time frame and wasnât damaged. We decided on a lighter treadmill since we would be placing it in an upstairs bonus room. Glad we did after we got it upstairs. Assembly was easy, only needed an extra hand for a couple steps. Had no issues with the instructions. Treadmill started out working great. After about a week, we had some issues. The incline no longer worked and the unit would just stop running after approximately one-quarter mile.  I reached out to Amazon for assistance and was only told it could be replaced AFTER I disassembled, repackaged, re-palletized, and shipped the old unit back. At least they offered to replace but this was out of the question. So I reached out to the manufacturer. I used the on-line  chat option. Was able to identify the issue and a replacement part was immediately shipped out to me. I replaced (I offered to replace the part, wasnât asked) the part and the treadmill works great. Typically I would be upset, but after receiving such  prompt service as I did from the manufacturer with the issue. Any purchase you make may have issues, but not every provider will stand behind their product. NT did and theyâve earned my future business.

  I received the treadmill with 2 broken parts and after a quick phone call to NordicTrack, they quickly sent me the new parts. The parts took 4 days (business days) to arrive and the assembly began. The hardest part for me was getting my daughter to hold the rails correctly so I could put the 4 bolts into them. It was the hardest part due to her not wanting to put her cell phone down and pay attention to what she was doing, lol. It took me about 3 hours to assemble, but that included replacing a broken foot rail and several trips to the basement for more tools. Overall we are very happy with the product and bypassed the Ifit registration by pressing the Ifit button for a few seconds and it turns on, just remember to put the ""safety key"" on the machine first. We forgot that part and it took a few tries to bypass it, until we had the ""ah haa"" moment and put the key on the treadmill. It then quickly turned on.  I'm very happy with the treadmill. I was going to buy a much cheaper one, but I am very happy and pleased that I decided to buy a brand that I've heard of and one that offers more features.

    Great foldable treadmill
  
",5.0,Jeff,"Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  This was very easy to assemble.  Instructions were straight forward.  It folds very easy and fits well to take up as little space as possible.  It's still a good size for running with lenght and width.  If you're a hardcore runner running at 8mph for 30 minutes or longer might want the next level up. But for any average running pace with sprints and walking intervals it's perfect. Has a nice incline, but might not be as steep as some people want. But when you can't run outside or are short on time this is a great treadmill to cover you. Controls are easy to use and see while running.Down side is it's a little loud like most treadmills and there isn't anything to really see on the small display screen. It'll show calorie counts and laps but isn't that accurate as you can't put in your weight.  But for just a nice work out it works out well

    Very Sturdy Machine

  When the gym that I had been going for over 20 years closed due to COVID-19 pandemic I did not know what I was going to do to continue exercising. A month went by and one day my friend said why donât you buy a Treadmill. I thought about it and by the next day I had ordered a NordicTrack Treadmill.  I received it within a week.  My son assembled it, the same day it was delivered. I did my first workout that day, for two hours, and since then, I use the Treadmill six days a week.  The machine is very sturdy with a high end motor very similar to a treadmill at the gym. This machine though has added features such as a screen to watch the iFit videos, a built in fan, an extra-long wide deck to put weights, bottles of water, towel, cell phone, iPad, etc. It also has a Bluetooth feature to listen to music or plug in a device. It starts right away. The speed picks up very quick. Incline and decline work excellent. The noise level is very low. I alternate workouts between manual and the iFit videos. The machine is very strong and I feel really safe whether Iâm running, inclining, jogging, or simply walking. It keeps track of my workouts and this helps to see my progress. Purchasing a NordicTrack Treadmill is one of the best decisions I have made.

  I just received and had my machine installed yesterday. Haven't quite used it but can't wait to. When I tried it, it's everything I was hoping for. Again, I haven't fully used it so nothing has gone wrong. One thing I will point out is that it's noisy. You will hear it from one room to another to another, unless you have a huge home. I am going to say thiat if you have it in the home, and you try to workout in the morning, whomever is sleeping will definately hear it.Other than that, so far so good.

    Good treadmill for the price.
  
",4.0,Katelyn Haas,"Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  I left a four for ease of assembly but to be clear, we had the expert installation done. It won't let me not select a rating.First time treadmill owner and not much of a gym runner before this, so I don't have a ton to compare it to. It's easy to fold up if need be, and seems nice and padded when running. The iFit workouts are a nice distraction from the pain of running although I'm not sure if we'll be renewing when it's time to pay.My annoyances with this product are:- no way to export treadmill audio to headphones. This was confirmed by a NordicTrack live chat. Yes, of course running on a treadmill is noisy in and of itself but it would be great to have the iFit audio in my ears...both so I can hear it better and so I'm making less racket. Short of loading the same workout on your phone and trying to play it at the same time, I don't have another solution. The sound is decent coming out of the treadmill but it's hard to not constantly fiddle with the volume if you're doing intervals. There's bluetooth connectivity, but only for streaming audio from that device through the treadmill. There's an aux jack, but again it's for playing your device's music through the treadmill which again seems really stupid. I'm going to go ahead and say my headphones are better quality than these treadmill speakers.- I don't know how to touch the speed/incline buttons or anything on that horizontal bar without getting shocked, and it sucks lol. Doesn't matter if I deaden myself on something else first.All told, this definitely meets our needs and we're satisfied with the product. The headphone issue is a big disappointment though and given the fact this advertises bluetooth connectivity and an aux jack, I never would have guessed I couldn't use headphones.

  This is a very nice machine, however, it's huge! It's definitely a size you would expect to see in a gym.  I wanted a mid-range treadmill that would have a good width and good weight limit.  This definitely meets those expectations, but you need to have a big spot for it in your house.  It's too big for a small bedroom or small office.  It won't be inconspicuous in a living area! That being said, it's a good, sturdy machine with lots of features.Also, bonus info.......you do NOT have to sign up for the Fit app program they claim you need in order to activate!! Just hold the FIT button that is right on the front of the machine face for 30 seconds and it will bypass the need to register and join.  Apparently this is a membership, but it's not necessary to run this treadmill.

  I opened the box and could hear flying insects buzzing, trying to escape the plastic wrapper around the treadmill! I few began to escape and I had to step on them. It freaked my wife out. I closed it back up and contacted Amazon, ordered a new one. The sad/bad thing is that I was told that since it was a Friday, the truck would not be able to pick up the bug infested treadmill until the following Monday. That was a nightmare. The package is extremely heavy and I could not move it alone. A package full of insects had to lay in my garage for days before it could be retrieved. Bad. Finally, the package was picked up, a new treadmill was dropped off, and now it works great. We love itâjust wish we had not been subjected to a possible infestation or unknown origin.The Amazon associate who I spoke with to organize the return was very professional and helpful.

    Nordic track treadmill
  
",4.0,DRL,"Reviewed in the United States November 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  You will need to put in your patience pants to assemble. Itâs not hard, just need to pay attention and take your time! The directions are good and the nuts & bolts package are labeled by steps to make it super easy. I was very happy to figure out how to bypass the ifit sign up/ activate. The treadmill comes with a big red sticker that says you wonât be able to unlock the treadmill w/out registering the Treadmill . BS!! Thatâs so misleading and not necessary. To get around it all you need to do is put the key in place,hold down the ifit Bluetooth symbol for 10 seconds or so and it gets rid of the locked screen and you are ready to go. Itâs really very sneaky of Nordic track! Not everyone had $400 or more when theyâve bought the product. You should be able to choose if youâd like to sign up for ifit workouts or go on your own. I didnât rate the treadmill too high bc I want to try it for week or so. I did start it up and walked for a bit and it seemed good. Overall I say it was easy to assemble ( I did it alone) & itâs priced great , it looks nice and I like that the bed fold up for easy storage and the wheels at the end make it super easy to move around .

  Even though the screen says âyour treadmill wonât activate until you register at ifit.comâ, this is not true. Make sure the red stop key is on, then press the iFit button on the screen and hold down for 10-20 seconds, until the screen unlocks. Just assembled mine. Some screws wouldnât screw all the way, but I am too tired now, will try again later. First impression: looks very sturdy and well made.

    Pretty Good No Frills Treadmill
  
",4.0,Megan,"Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have a small-ish apartment but I wanted a treadmill I could use to make cardio a bit more manageable instead of spending a huge chunk of time at the gym. It's sturdy and a decent size but not obtrusive. My boyfriend put it together in about 30 minutes, I did have to help a bit to hold up the top part. You can get around registering it on iFit. It goes to an incline of 10 and both the incline and speed increase smoothly. My only complaint about this product is the stopping function. There is no cool down button which is totally fine but the other problem is that when you push stop, it just stops. So DO NOT stop when you are going fast and I can imagine if you accidentally pulled off the emergency shutdown button, you'd literally faceplant into the console or fly backwards.

  We embarked on purchasing a treadmill to keep relatively in shape during this time of covid.  I was honestly skeptical of having such a large/heavy item shipped and assembling it.  It arrived right on time and the Amazon delivery guys placed it exactly where needed.  Be careful, it is heavy, so assemble with care.  It went together easily and I took their advice of plugging it into a surge protector since it is an expensive purchase.  I enjoy how smooth it works, both the belt motor and the incline motor.  The controls are intuitive and you can use this with or without the Nordic Track app.  We use it almost daily and am glad we purchased it.

  Weâd been searching for an affordable treadmill since the pandemic began, but things continued to be pretty much sold out everywhere. So happy we were able to finally land this one! Assembly is VERY tricky. Not gonna lie - it took my fiancÃ© and I about 4 days to get it up and running. It comes in a VERY large, VERY heavy box. But the delivery guys were great. They were on-time and brought the box inside for us. I like to do inclines and was skeptical about what this machine could handle, but let me tell you - I get just as good or better of a workout on this treadmill than I did on the machines at our local gym. Thank you to all the reviewers who posted the cheat code on bypassing the iFit activation. Once we got it assembled, we held the iFit button down for about 30 seconds and everything was good to go! Highly recommend.

  This review is not about working out with the machine. I bought this product with the professional installer option in late December. The installer came around the second week of January, put it together and the belt came off and broke two days later. I found a bunch of bolts and pieces that the installer just flat out didn't use. I called to get replacement part, that took two weeks to get here. The technician was supposed to call after the part came but did not. I called to get in touch with technician and was just told its going to be three weeks until they can come out. at that point I will have paid for this product two months prior and been able to use it once before it broke.

  I have gone to the gym for the last six years and was use to the commercial grades there. Covid-19 came around, and I stopped going to the gym for safety concerns. Overall, really like this treadmill and the quality. With the iFit compatibility I didn't feel like I lost anything from leaving the gym. I did 50 miles on it in 10 days, and feel that it will last. I hadn't used the iFit before and like it.I am 5'5, 260 when I got this and feel it is sturdy and will hold up. The speakers are not the best, but I normally run with headphones anyways. I have used my Aftershokz, the adjustment on incline going up is the loudest part. Doesn't cause a problem for me. The emergency cord is a good length, but doesn't stay well on my workout shirts- again not the end of the world. I would recommend taking the emergency stop off when done, otherwise the screen will stay lit up.You do not need to do the iFit, but I like it and will keep it as it reminds me of classes at the gym. I also like the scenic walking hiking paths. To BYPASS iFit just hold the button down for until it turns green, and you are in manual mode.INTERVALS can be done by the whole number and the plus or minus signs. OR by hitting the numbers quickly. IE 4.7 by hitting 4 than 7 quickly.I do not feel that it is noisy, nor does my roommate. Single floor house, tile throughout and he is down the hallway and doesn't hear me running awake or when he is asleep (very light sleeper) if his door is shut. He can hear my TV for reference.You will need two people to help you assemble. Do not tighten too much when putting the console on, wait until its all together than tighten. Either wise you will have trouble with it pulling to one side or the other and folding will be problematic.The feet are able to be adjusted, which is great because floors are rarely even. Do a couple of test miles to see if you have this right.

  Like many reviews, the screw holes were not properly drilled. Cross threading is easy to do with some holes.

I did subscribe to IFit, and I am enjoying it so far. I like the various workouts they have available. I think this was a smart purchase since I donât feel comfortable going to the gym at this time. I would recommend the product. Hopefully I will have it around for awhile.

    Nice treadmill for walking - not much fun to assemble
  
",4.0,mamaseoul,"Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  First of all, the delivery guys were great.  Initially they were going to leave on the porch but I asked them to put in my garage - on the SECOND floor!  Took a bit of persuasion but I would not have been able to move it up there myself so grateful for the assist.  The box was beat up and had visible holes and tears.  However, the packaging on the inside was really amazing.  No damage at all to the treadmill.  I did have several problems assembling - my lack of paying attention to the ground wire when I put the wire harness on caused the first issue.  If you don't keep the ground wire on the outside of the hole, you will find out how sharp the holes are in the metal.  It took me a good 20 minutes to fish out the wire and I also cut my fingers up pretty good.  I did ultimately get the ground wire out and connected.  However, the screw hole wasn't tapped completely so I had a hard time getting it tight enough to actually function as a grounding wire.  I also had a lot of trouble getting the front bar to align properly.  The left side was simple but the right side was difficult.  The tab on the upper side did not fit neatly into the lower part.  I was concerned that it would break if I put too much pressure on it so I went very slowly and worked the piece from the far left across and finally got it to go into place.  The belt was misaligned out of the box but the website has clear instructions on how to adjust.  I have used every day since I purchased and am very happy with the product itself.  I read the reviews about problems with iFit.  Since I am just using it for walking I don't need the subscription.  I  cancelled on line probably on the third day.  No issues and very simple for me to cancel.  I wouldn't let that stop you from purchasing and I thought a few of the programs would have worked well for me 20 years ago.  Just not my thing.

  This saved my sanity during Covid-19!! The world stopped in March when Gyms were closed and for a mama of 4 young kids, I don't have the time to schedule baby sitters to run and workout outside. I am also one that likes to workout in peace with no kids and I like to be distracted while running. So this treadmill is perfect and checks all my boxes for that. You can choose between hundreds of different kinds of workouts. Beginner level all the way to advanced.  I love the warm up and cool down features. I just got this treadmill at the first of August so I haven't had it long enough to give a thorough review. BUT so far I love it and it gets me excited to run every morning by choosing a different workout each day.PROS:perfect size for a in-home treadmill and folds up nice to save space. We have it in our bedroom and it doesn't bother me too badhas 2 nice sized cup holdersspeakers are loud and you can adjust the sound of the music, trainer and background noise100's of different workouts to choose fromI love that the trainers adjust the incline automatically so you get a better workoutCONSNO FANS!! I read reviews before buying and some were saying it had fans. This model DOES NOT if you want the feature with the fans with a little better motor spend the extra $$ and get the 8.5 S model with the  10"" or 14"" screen.Motor is a little louder than I thought it would be for the price, but not worth dropping stars overTouch screen is sometimes hard to use. The features just need to be updated a bit for a more modern better experience to find workouts/ fitness level.

  I'm loving my treadmill. I think it's the best for the price. I walk or light jog here and there at home. Nothing crazy.  It's a perfect size. Not the huge machines from the gym but not the tiny $300 walmart tread I originally ordered that was so small I felt like a giant walking on it. I have had it for about a month now.For me, it was extremely important to get something that would feel sturdy and support my weight, give me good range of speed and incline and not feel like I was heavier than the machine. I weight 230 and am 5'8. It was disheartening to see so many machines max out at 200lbs. I didn't want to break the bank buying a tread, but I couldn't buy anything that wouldn't support me either. I don't think the assembly is easy. My husband did it and thankfully he is quite handy, but for me it wouldve taken me days! The only thing that really bothered me about this tread is that they want to force you to purchase a monthly service and you technically can't turn it on without providing your credit card info to even turn on the machine. I am so grateful to everyone in the comments who posted about how to avoid that.  It's really unthinkable to me that I would have to purchase MORE to use a machine that I have already fully paid for, so shame on the company for that! Definetly don't do that and just follow all the advise on herw on how to go around it. Other than that, I really couldn't be happier. It's sturdy, great range of levels, good motor. I love it! Especially during the pandemic. I've been walking 30 minutes a day and it's been great!

  You do need to register first on ifit and download the app, but after the first month, you can cancel the membership and use it with any problems. The speed is from1-10, and believe me, I had been to the gym and on their treadmill the speed 6 will be a 4.5 on this one. You can easily lower and increase the speed as you need it, the incline is amazing, this treadmill is very solid (no shaking or sturdy), the settings are very easy to use, the cup holders are wide and large enough, it has space for your phone ( I had put my laptop on top of it and is perfectly fine). My kids used them too and is very easy for them as well. Great product, you won't regret it after you understand you don't need the app after the first month.

    NordicTrack Treadmill Belt Issue

  This treadmill had only 20 minutes on it when the belt moved to one side and would not adjust with the instructions in the product manual.  After almost 2 hours waiting on chat, I find out it is a known issue.  They are sending me 2 screws to replace the failing ones; the problem is the placement of these 2 screws is behind a preassembled unit on the back of the unit.  I have a 3 month warrantee, plus another 3 month warrantee for registering it online, plus I bought a 3 year extended warrantee.  Yet they want ME to do the labor to replace 2 screws that I cannot possibly reach and that could affect the performance of the product.  I had to fight with them to send out a repair tech to do the job.  Only when I threatened to dispute the charge on my credit card did they schedule a tech to do the repair.  Really?!?!  What's wrong with this picture?  Now I'm in a waiting mode, unable to use the treadmill for what could be 3-5 weeks until the parts are received and the repair done.  I have a NordicTrack elliptical and a NordicTrack recumbent bike and have been happy with both which is why I went with NordicTrack treadmill.

  The treadmill is very heavy so try to get it delivered as close to where you want it as possible.  After you destroy the box to open it you will find the instructions that state you need to save the packaging material in case there is a problem. The instructions are very well put together and the hardware is clearly marked.The actual assembly is fairly easy except for the fact that the bolts that hold the uprights to the bottom frame are cheaply made.  They are not tapered for easy thread engagement.  On top of the problem with the bolts, some of the built in retaining nuts have coating on the threads making screwing in the bolts an unnecessary challenge. After struggling with the first four bolts, I found a spare bolt I had on hand and ran it into the threads clearing the coating before installing the other four.  This may sound trivial, but the bolts are not high quality and I seriously thought I was going to break one off in the frame.Thankfully there are reviews the state how to bypass the built in lock by pressing the iFit button for 30 seconds.We were up and running after about an hour of assembly.  So far the treadmill works as it should.  I will update if there are any changes.

  3 stars because what they didn't tell you is that you are getting either a returned item, used item, or refurbished item. That's why they can sell it at such a mark down from retail. Just look at the pictures i took when i got the machine out of the box. There were a few more scuff marks then just that. Machine worked though and everything running okay til this day. Kind of false advertisement that this is brand new. I waited a few months to put out this review for that reason. To make sure it was still functioning and it is.

  I have had this for about 3 months now, which is long enough to know, that I really love it! It pretty much checks all the boxes; it works flawlessly, is built tough, and is good looking too. The only thing I would recommend is to pay a few extra bucks and get the in-home assembly. It is a bit of a long and complicated assembly, so spare yourself the hassle. Two of the holes in one of my brackets were not large enough to fit the screws through, so I had to go to Lowe's and get a metal drill bit in order to make the holes slightly bigger. Not an ideal scenario, but it all worked out. Again, PAY TO GET THE IN-HOME ASSEMBLY. Otherwise, this is a really nice unit.

  This thing has changed my Covid life. I use it 1-2 hours a day. I am a female, I live in a climate thatâs freezing cold for many months out of the year and while I love to walk alone, I wonât do it after dark. I walk fast - occasionally I run in bursts for a minute or 2 and I use the incline a lot. This treadmill is solid and quiet. My boyfriend is 200+ pounds and also walks on it and feels supported. Get the delivery option to have it left where you want it. The box is big and heavy and it doesnât have wheels to move it around from room to room. The lift feature for space saving works really well but donât get this if you need to move it around.

  I waited to write a review until I had some time to get used to my new NordicTrack.  I had a treadmill previously but after two weeks of walking a dog in the hills of Oakland, CA I decided I wanted a treadmill with an incline and greater speed. This has both. I am 72 years old and the treadmill gives me a great workout and the incline is great for losing weight and building nice glutes!  It came with a free month of iFit, which you are required to sign up for to get the thing to work.  I didn't like that but I did enjoy the free month.  I was able to map the walk I had taken in Oakland and walk it again.  I could see the path and the treadmill would automatically incline where it should on the walk.  I didn't continue the iFit due to the price but I do love the treadmill.  I have it in front of my TV, put on a series and go for an hour with entertainment.  This was a great investment for me!

  Disclaimer: I have never worked out at home or at gym for any meaningful period. I can't remember in my whole life if I had an occasion of outside jogging.Bought this while it's on sale at $599. Great price! Couldn't be more happier. Mine has a small display with the monotone blue background color that I don't think has the capability to cast movies, but I don't care. The front panel has a small stand area where I can put a laptop.Before purchasing, I did my research and figured out that you can activate (or I should say unlock) and use the treadmill without buying the ifit subscription. As others said, I just pressed the blue ifit button for ~10 seconds (some people say 30 seconds), and it unlocked itself.Installation: I had a little issue with running a wire during assembling (made a mistake to run a wire below a metal bar whereas I should have run the wire over the bar), so I had to disassemble almost everything after I completed assembling! I'm pretty infirm, so having to disassemble all the way back felt like a total disaster. The manual could have been improved to stress how the wire should run. But once I've done installation, that's it! I am very satisfied with the product.

  I have been shopping for exercise equipment since COVID so I can do some cardio from home. I was super excited to find an affordable NordicTrack treadmill on Amazon. I opted for the delivery option to have the driver bring the treadmill inside the doorway. They never knocked and just left it outside. This is the only complaint I had about the Amazon service. One bolt was not able to thread during assembly of the arms that support the console but we continued without it. The iFit registration was a bit confusing but after looking up videos on YouTube I was able to figure it out. Total assembly time was about 2 hours with two people. It is very heavy so definitely bring a strong friend to help move/assemble.

  Good treadmill. I really like the ifit training. Assembly was difficult and i am a person that likes to assemble things. Some of the predefined holes didnât line up perfectly so the plastic has uneven gaps from one side to the other and some of the plastic doesnât lay flat or fitted as i would think it would. Sometimes there is weird noises when it is adjusting incline. Incline numbers go to like 10 or 12 canât remember from my couch, but the incline doesnât seem that high. Overall i really like it and use it daily, I am glad i bought it. It came with one year free trial of ifit for on the treadmill and i even downloaded it on my phone to do ifit workouts while traveling for work.

  It started off bad due to the poor delivery.... The delivery company wedges the giant heavy box on a little side porch I have and it was extremely hard to remove and take to my actual door. The box was ripped in many places and practically falling to pieces...Then began the process of putting it together. I'm a handy person and this still took me about 3hrs to do. I had many problems due to poor instructions and design, but eventually got through it.Luckily I read prior reviews before use and knew to hold in the ifit button for 30seconds to bypass that crap and just use the treadmill like normal.I then noticed the belt was severely off track to the left. After some quick youtube videos I was able to adjust the bolts to fix this and align it to center... You think they would have had alignment and tightness set on a new treadmill but I guess not?I also notice that the belt slows when you step on it to begin walking. I have tried adjusting tightness and the problem still persists.After going through the initial hell of the shipping and getting everything set up, the treadmill seems decent and seems to work fine besides the belt slowing issue mentioned above. If I can solve that issue it will actually be a overall nice unit. I expected alittle more quality out of the box given the price, but oh well.

  This was good while it lasted, which wasn't long at all.

We've waited 3 months, no help. We've called the company and they told us they'd ship the belt and we can replace it ourselves.After a $700 machine plus $200 on the warranty, we were compleltey ripped off. Its been out of use since June and they have no plans on fixing it, or helping. So its just a huge, heavy, item that I need to dispose of.Do your research and get something that is more reliable and not built so cheaply and save your money - don't get the warranty.

  We received our treadmill yesterday and built it from top to bottom. To our disappointment, when we turned on the treadmill, the belt would not move no matter what speed we put it on. The next day, we had a friend who is a technician look at the treadmill and he told us that the motor is defective. Even though the incline on the device works and the screen turns on, the belt still does not seem to move. We spent 4+ hours setting this treadmill up from top to bottom. We are certain we did not skip any steps or install it incorrectly as we used the instruction manual religiously throughout the entire process. It is downright egregious that we would drop over 600 dollars to receive a product that is defective. We are disappointed in Nordic and would not recommend this product to any customers. There are many other customers including myself who are experiencing several failures with this product. Listen to us and STAY AWAY. You should rather buy your treadmills from Sole or Proform as they have better products and WAY better customer service.

IT'S SUPER HEAVY  i would recommend when ordering you ask they bring it indoors for you that was a huge mistake i made because it was soooo heavy and they put it by my neighbors apartment not mine so you can imagine my struggle.During the time putting it together there was only a few issues 1 was the bar the is holding the screen panel part was not lining up this alone took my husband and I almost 20 minutes because it would not line up nor would it screw in (we even broke a screwdriver that's how hard it was) I would have got an assembler to come out but he didn't want me to. Anyways I used it for 30 mins this morning and it worked flawlessly. I WILL UPDATE if any problems I haven't noticed yet show up

  This treadmill is everything I wanted for the price.  The layout of the controls is really nice with large, responsive buttons.  The digital readout is clear and gives all of the information I was looking for.  The build quality seems really quite nice and solid.  Itâs generally pretty quiet for a treadmill, similar in noise level to what youâd use as a gym.  My wife and I got it 3 months ago and weâve put a lot of miles on it so far.  Itâs been great for us as we donât like running outside in the winter rain/snow.  You could spend $200+ more and get basically the same treadmill with a large, tablet like touchscreen display but we didnât need this.  Iâd suggest saving the money and getting this model instead.  We didnât see much value with the iFit app so we didnât keep it beyond the free trial period.  Overall a great treadmill for the price and I highly recommend it.

",5.0,Matt,"Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  Iâve been using this machine for a while now, and so far - no complaints. It does what itâs supposed to do, and while it is relatively new, it seems to function as a reliable piece of equipment. Iâve not owned any other treadmill before this one, but Iâve used a few in the gym. The comfort level on this one is pretty similar to the gym ones. It has enough room for a tall person no to feel confined. The only comment that Iâd have for the manufacturer is that the heart rate monitor is located not on the side bars that youâd use to put your hands on, but on the bar thatâs right under the control panel, and, at least, for a tall person they arenât located conveniently, but rather too low. I donât really use it for this reason, although I would if they were located on side bars. Other than that - it seems like a very solid piece of exercising equipment, and I do enjoy using it so far!

  Serves it's purpose. Easy enough to set up and adjust as needed (follow ALL the directions, they are there for a reason). Despite it being delivered with the box beat up in parts, the contents were luckily protected well enough. If you're expected a gym quality beast with all the bells and whistles, this isn't it, but for a simple at home option that allows you to get a run/walk in, it's great. To repeat what others seem to still be missing - if you hold the iFit button down, it allows you to bypass the subscription option.  I'm 5'4"" and my hubby is 6'4"" and neither of us have a problem using it, inclined or not, so please take those not picky ""complaints"" with a grain of salt. Jury is out on the accuracy of the speed/distance, it's constantly at odds with my Garmin watch, but no biggie for me because I'm not super serious about that. The fold feature works, but personally I don't trust it and it doesn't fold up enough to make any space saving difference, so I leave it down. There are no clear instructions on lubricating the track though (unless I missed it), other than pushing their extended warranty, so that was kind of irritating.

    No Safety Latch, goes up 2/3 way without locking in place, hold blue button 30 seconds to unlock
  
",3.0,Jane Austen Fan from VA,"Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased this to replace a 21 year old ProForm Treadmill I paid 1K for (that had a safety latch, and went all the way up, not just 2/3rds of the way up), that finally bit the dust about two weeks ago.  I ordered this treadmill the morning the old one died. It arrived on Friday and we put it together Saturday.  It took a few hours because getting some of the screws in the holes, was difficult.  It also doesn't have the wheels like the ProForm did so it made it a little hard to move once we got it together.  Unless you want to purchase the Nordic Track training, just hold down the blue button for 30 seconds and it will unlock regardless of what the manual says.  I've used it twice now.  And while I wish I had spent a little more and got the one with the fan, like the ones at the gym have, it does get the job done.  I have a gym membership so I have cardio training on the ap while the gym Is closed and it worked well, smooth incline and decline.  You can adjust the speed or just push the numbers and it will take you to that speed, and then you can go the .1-.9 in that speed zone.  I haven't tried to synch it with my iPhone yet so not sure what the stereo sounds like, but for now that's not something I'm going crazy about getting done.  Would I buy it again, probably not and I've only used it Sunday, and this morning.  I don't like the fact that it doesn't go all the way up, and more importantly there is no safety latch.  I have a disabled daughter who I am afraid would kick the mechanism by mistake and it would come down on her.  She's like a toddler, and I could also see a toddler going over to the pump, kicking where the foot is, and while it does come down slowly maybe wouldn't move in time and get seriously hurt.

For 10 days the junk was just taking space doing nothing. 10 freaking days!!!!Then finally when the screws arrived and I finished the assembly, and gave it a try, at the very first attempt of trying the incline/decline feature; inclining was OK (albeit painfully slow and noisy); but declining resulted in a loud clang when going down. I looked under the belt to see if something broke, no, everything looked ok. Turned off and on and tried again, same result.Tried to reach customer care again but due to long hold times every single time, I just gave up and returned this nightmare. Thanks to Amazon for making the return smooth.THEN - about a month after this return, I get an email from NordicTrack (who apparently have no idea that I have returned their piece of crap), that I will get a free treadmill mat if I leave a positive review.Here NordicTrack, here is your positive review which is what all you care about.

    Product quality leaves a lot to be desired
  
",4.0,K. Norman,"Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2021","









  
  
    
  First off, let me say that maybe the best thing about my experience with the Nordictrack T 7.5 S treadmill was the Amazon delivery.  Although I requested ""any room delivery"" I received a text from the shipping company saying they would deliver it to my front door.  But, to my relief, the two young delivery men carried it to the second floor of my home.  They were also extremely careful to not mar the walls.  Exceptional!My wife and I proceeded to assemble the treadmill.  This would have only been a moderately difficult task, except that one of the wheels that is supposed to bolt to the front of the frame for maneuverability, wouldn't go into place.  This is because there was a protruding excess weld globule that extended about 3/8-inch from the frame.  I called NordicTrack and they said they would process a replacement, which is ridiculous.  If I had purchased assembly, no doubt they would have attempted to fix it on the spot.  Nevertheless, I did not dissuade them for initiating this.  It's been 7 weeks and I have as yet to be contacted by Nordictrack, although they acknowledge that they need to correct the issue.  In the meantime, I purchased a die grinder attachment for a drill and after a significant amount of grinding the very hard weld material, I was able to get the wheel to fit into place.  This added a trip to the hardware plus an extra hour or so to the assembly process.Once the wheel could be attached, the entire assembly was pretty straightforward and took my wife and I about 4 hours.  The fit of the plastic pieces is mediocre in several places.  I've included a photo of the worst offender where the control panel attaches to the base.I was under the impression that it would be possible to connect an iPad via Bluetooth to the treadmill for viewing the iFit videos on a larger screen.  Unfortunately, that is not the case.  A significant disappointment.  Nevertheless, although the screen is small it is sufficient for viewing the videos.  And I must say, I was not intending to subscribe to iFit after the 1 year subscription ran out, but the quality of the content is exceptional, including hiking around several different countries with entertaining and informative trainers.  The treadmill speed and incline adjust along with the trainer and the terrain being traversed.  Those can be overridden if more or less effort is desired and then return to the iFit intended speed and incline when desired.The 3.0 CHP motor is barely sufficient when attempting a cool-down walk at less than 1.5 mi/h.  I weigh 175 lb and the treadmill slows significantly with each step.  It also seems to labor when changing the incline.  Although it isn't too loud to hear the iFit videos through the speakers, the treadmill isn't as quiet as I expected, especially when the incline is changing, which is fairly frequent when hiking through hills and mountains.  But, it's tolerable.When shopping for a treadmill nowadays, you will see the lifetime warranties of yore are rare.  I have a suspicion that due to iFit commanding frequent incline and speed changes, the life of the motors isn't what they would otherwise be.So, in all, I am generally happy with the purchase and function of the treadmill.  It makes exercising on a daily basis easy and enjoyable.

I think it's false advertising... so I chatted with Amazon rep and was informed my question was being pass along to NordicTrack, it's been 5 days and not a word from anyone - very sad customer service.On another note, the Amazon assembly was difficult to schedule (had to reschedule 3 times) although the final assembly looks fine.So, beware - the NordicTrack seems ok, the membership is a cheat, and the assembly is frustrating.

    Belt is not moving out of box
  
",2.0,Ken Ngo,"Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2021","









  
  
    
  Amazon made a good delivery of 200+ pounds treadmill. Assemble was ok. I did it by myself most of it in 2 hours. At the end I found out that the belt wasn't moving, which turned out it was the motor controller board. I contacted Amazon for return, but Amazon said they will take some time to investigate. I contacted NordicTrack for support. It wasn't easy, but I made it through. Their customer service was good, they agreed to send the part to me. I'm still sitting here and waiting for the part. Amazon still hasn't gotten back to me. Overall, it was bad experience with the product, also with Amazon. I wouldn't recommend this treadmill to anyone.

  First treadmill that was delivered was either damaged in shipping or it was a return that they tried pawning off on me. The bottom cover for the motor was cracked and the clips that hold the top of the cover on were all snapped.. Second one was perfect. If you receive a damaged one do not put up with that, you're paying over a grand for it, it should be in brand new condition.Assembly was easy enough but I can see the directions being confusing to some. In the pack of paperwork with the directions and bolts you'll find a gift card for your free one year of ifit. Even though you get a free one year of ifit youll need a credit card to set up your account, that is if you wish to use it. You can bypass ifit all together if you want it but if you're getting a free year might as well use it. You can always remove card info after setup.Anyways after using it a couple of time I'm very satisfied with my purchase. Ifit seems cool but I don't know if the yearly renewal will be worth it, it's a little pricey. I have a year to figure it out though.

    Engaging workouts with iFit
  
",4.0,Anil D'Souza,"Reviewed in the United States December 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  The treadmill itself is pretty nice: wide / long belt gives plenty of room to move quickly, the assembly was pretty straight forward and can mostly be done by one person (need a bit of help to hold things in place while screwing), and the larger screen on the 9.5 model I think was worth the additional expense (though I wish you could turn off the screen without having to power down the whole machine).The real standout is the combination of iFit with the interactive motor. Classes are pretty engaging, taking you to international destinations â  and it helps a lot that you don't have to adjust the motor along the way because it automatically follows along with the class you're taking. I'm not really a class person but this system changed my mind (for half of my workouts, at least). My one gripe is that the Android based system is REALLY slow so you have to be patient with the machine when getting set up.

  Regarding the ""easy to fold"" evaluation: I am an 80-year-old female recovering from severe anemia.  If I were a decade younger and at full strength age-wise, ""easy to fold"" might be rated 5. My son-in-law assembled the treadmill readily, except for the need to adjust out a few squeaks--which he was able to do. Other than its being noisier than anticipated, I have only positive things to say. I appreciate the range of selections for speed and incline, and I think I will like iFit, which I am now learning to use. It seems straightforward; I just had to acquire  a device (iPad) to use it. The screen of my iPhone was too small to be helpful.My strength and endurance goals that center around walking were set in collaboration with my PT.  I now live where there are long, cold winters, so having the treadmill means that walking is no longer weather-dependent.  I can think of many incentives for meeting these goals, primarily the desire for better overall health, in and of itself. At the same time, who wants to miss a good trip whenever COVID allows for it? Have stamina, will travel (Lord willing)!

  The treadmill came damaged and inoperable (doesn't operate, not like a surgeon, it just doesn't work) and when they came to return the product, I was told they could not take it back because it was partially assembled, which I paid for through the professional assembly option and now I have a treadmill that doesn't work that they won't take back and I seemingly can't get my money back. I guess it's going to be cat food for supper for a little while (not really)Update: I contacted Amazon about the problem and they stated that I had to disassemble the product and put it in the box it came in so it can be returned. The problem is it took two people to take it out of the box and it was professionally assembled. I donât have neither the tools nor the ability to take it apart and place it in the box. Iâm going to have to pay to disassemble it and the place it in the box. I just spent over $200 on nothing If I go that route, a product that was delivered damaged.

  Problem is with manufacturing. Delivery and assembly personnel were great.  Once treadmill was assembled, there was a cut and dent on the motor hood. We tested the machine and discovered that the incline doesnât work. Customer service was fairly easy to reach. Contacted Icon and arrangements were made to ship me a new hood and board part for the incline feature. I am waiting for a technician to replace the parts. It is sad that the brand new equipment already requires a repair visit in order for it to work properly. I was planning to purchase a stationary bike in the near future but will be looking at other brands.

  Never actually got to use it. I got it fairly quickly but It was delivered broken which was very disappointing. They said they couldnât get a new one delivered for another couple weeks (Iâm assuming since it was out of stock) so I just went out and bought one from the store. The Amazon people I chatted with online weâre very kind and helpful (well minus the first person. He told me I could keep the broken treadmill or throw it away and I would have my new one in 1-3 days which was not true). The whole process was rather annoying and itâs inconvenient for me to move this thing around again so they can pick it up. It looked like it wouldâve been a nice treadmill but I never want to deal with this ever again.

  For this price, I'm not sure you could get something much better. Has a good range of speed up to 10mph which is plenty for my purposes. Also, you DO NOT need to subscribe to iFit to use this. Once plugged in and turned on, simply press and hold the iFit button until the screen comes on and it's ready for use. Maybe ~20-30 seconds. Feels very sturdy and the cup holders are large enough to put a 32oz water bottle. Overall a great purchase, especially with payment installment options.

    Good, but cheaply made and broken out of the box
  
",3.0,Boyan Mihov,"Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  I would have given this a 4 or 5 star review, however it's cheaply with lots of plastic parts and I'm super annoyed with the fact that the cover above the motor was broken out of the box. (see picture) The machine works fine and does the job well so far, however it's not pleasant seeing your brand new product having broken parts right out of the box. A treadmill is a big and heavy machine and so unless it stops working I do not want to go through the trouble of returning it over a broken cover which makes me more annoyed that now I have to see it all cricked to the side and know that if I want this fixed it'll be a pain in my @$$ to pack it again, return it, wait for a new one, unpack, and reassemble again, PLUS it's super heavy...Anyway, off to the actual review.Pros:Belt size - I'm 5' 10'' and the size of the belt is perfect for my stride.Foldable - It's pretty easy and simple to fold and unfold. Also has a very nice feature that it unfolds slowly and you don't have to use strength to pull it down and fear of slamming into the floor.Preset workouts - if you want to use the preset workouts provided or create your own it's as simple as click of a button.Cup Holders and heart-pulse monitor features included.Cons:Speakers - Weak speakers and if you are running on anything over a speed of 4 you are better off using headphones or different speakers vs the built in ones.Ifit Activation - Seems like there's a lot of treadmill companies who have a contract with ifit or similar companies in order to force you to sign up for their BS plans. The treadmill cannot be used unless you go into Ifit.com and actually create an account and activate the machine and they try to make you sign up and pay for monthly plans in order to keep track of your workouts... First of all I don't want to give me information anywhere, second I already have a Fitbit and ways to track myself no need to force me to go on iFit.Overall plastic feel - there's lots of plastic parts and feels cheaply made, however you get what you pay for.

  This is a GREAT treadmill! I am really enjoying it. I have recommended this treadmill to many friends and family. With my recommendation I suggest paying for the installation. The packaging is extremely heavy. As other's said, the box was beat up upon arrival and it was not the shipper's fault. I thoroughly inspected each piece and found everything to be in good and safe condition. I am generally able to assemble big items together on my own and move heavy furniture on my own. Getting this down into my basement and assembling it on my own really made me question my life choices. I should have had another adult around for safety reasons. If you have to guide it up or down stairs, or cannot lift items 50lbs or heavier on your own you should really pay someone to help you put this together - even if it is friend, pay them some how because this thing is a job. Very worth the hassle because it works great!

  When researching portable treadmills, I decided to spend more and get one with a wider 20"" tread belt than the less expensive 15"" belt of the other popular model.

Even though it folds easily, it's not really portable and isn't going to fit in a close. But it's fantastic!  As far was  the negative reviews about the ifit ""scam"" in which the machine won't start without an ifit subscription...yes,  the machine comes with red warning signs saying ""Your treadmill is currently locked. It will not start until you go to ifit.com/actvate."" But the wonderful Amazon servicemen who delivered it just showed me to hold down the sync button for 10 seconds and it was good to go! It feels solid and roomy and is quieter than I thought.

    Decent cheap treadmill
  
",3.0,MacLean F.,"Reviewed in the United States February 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  Most certainly works. Love the motor...generally smooth and quiet to run on. Settings let you incline to 12 degrees and speed to 12 mph. No decrease in angle which would have been nice.Mostly concerned with the software platform. Looks like it's based on Android 7 which is hopelessly out of date and rife with security concerns. Wifi only...no ethernet.Also the treadmill's instructions clearly state NOT to incline the treadmill when folded...twice now when I left the treadmill on it went through a full up down cycle and made some awful noises in the folded position. The bluetooth speakers also like to go a ghostly beep when a connected device is out of range or some other complaint...which essentially means you need to flip this treadmill completely off when you're not using it...and therefore the power button should not be on the bottom front of the treadmill.Assembly was not difficult but the parts did not fit well together. A couple of the plastic pieces came with broken tabs. The packaging was secure and nothing arrived damaged in shipping...took a huge dump run to get rid of the massive pallet and cardboard...every piece was individually wrapped in thin film plastic.When you run on the treadmill just about everything in the trays bounces and rattles around...so I suppose they're good for a soft towel or two...but that's about that.I'm torn on iFit. Compared with the competition it's a cheap alternative. The instructors and enthusiastic, the programs are well filmed and edited and it's great that the treadmill automatically adjusts to their program. The issue I have is the I am in no way in good shape and the programs are all ridiculously easy. Which means I have to manually turn everything up...slightly annoying. I wish there was a plus 10, 20, 30 percent or some other setting to turn up all the programs globally. iFit shows my weekly stats...but they're my weekly stats from my first week and it's locked up and stuck on those stats. I probably need to factory reset it. It also continues to prompt to update even through you select it and it doesn't do anything.

  I am a seasoned runner currently training for a half marathon and can honestly say this is a good treadmill. Weâve owned it for over a month and have had overwhelmingly positive experiences. There are several workout options besides just manual mode (hills, intervals, speed etc.). It is true that you can bypass the iFit membership by pressing down and holding the iFit button. We had to press it REALLY hard because initially it wasnât working.There are built in speakers on the 6.5 model that only work with an aux cable. No integrated bluetooth or apps besides iFit. It folds up very easily and doesnât require tons of space. The power cord isnât very long. I recommend purchasing a lengthy surge protector to remedy this issue and protect your investment.It took 2 of us a few hours to put together. If installation service is available, I highly advise saving yourself the frustration.For the first couple of weeks we heard a loud clunking noise coming from the motor area; however, that issue resolved itself with daily use.The 6.5 model is an excellent value and well suited for all types of runners. I thought I would regret not purchasing the more expensive model, but thatâs not the case at all! I run on it comfortably for 5+ miles at a time.The mileage counter on the treadmill never coincides with my Apple Watch. There is about a 2/10 of a mile difference. Iâm not sure which is more accurate. The calorie counters donât match up either. Not a big deal for me but I realize it may be for some.I donât know if itâs just me, but the tread seems to move a lot faster than the one at the gym. I had to reduce the speed by .5mph to maintain my usual cadence.Overall, the Nordic Track was the best investment we made for our stay at home gym.

I called Amazon on two different occasions for help on both occasions, they put me on hold and returned saying they were unable to get in touch with NordicTrack. After the second failed attempt, I told them to come get the treadmill. Now I am waiting for a refund that can take weeks and on top of that, I cannot get a refund for the assembly that I paid almost $100 for because they said that the assemblers job was complete so no refund is warranted.

  Itâs been about almost 20 days since we received product and the first thing I need to state is that even though it says you have to have ifit you donât. Just hold the ifit button down for a few seconds and tada ready to use.Putting it together was a bit of a challenge but I had read enough reviews to know this could happen but that I would be happy I did. It took about 1 1/2 to put it all together. We the quality of treadmill we are receiving it is well worth it. Our did come with a broken cup holder but reached out to amazon and they took care of it.We love that the incline works perfect and itâs not so noisy. We felt it was like when you go to the gym and use those treadmills. Just the same amount. We like the 20 in width belt and it was one of the things we were looking for so this was just right our ally. It was shorter than we wanted (5 inches) but still perfect for the price.When it comes to the belt, you may have to adjust from time to time so it wonât rub on the sides. It comes with a tool and itâs super easy to do. We use the incline a lot and notice the difference of the belt and how it is very important to keep that tool so if it does need adjustment. We have only adjusted twice the first time using and havenât since. Again we are very happy with the product.Excellent but for the price and great for a runner and walker. We do interval running but usually run about 7 and it is an awesome feel to our steps. It doesnât have long side rails but it just a matter of getting use to it. No big deal about that.Highly recommend you buy the product and as stated before you do NOT need ifit. If itâs your kind of things well you can always get the subscription. Oh and it doesnât have a fan but still worth the buy.Loving and enjoy the treadmill.

  Where I failed: donât tighten anything until you have the whole thing assembled, not just at the end of each step. I was able to get it together though it took some rather strong language and a call to customer service to figure out what had gone wrong. I still managed to get it together without help, but the difficulty I faced in assembly was of my own making.That said, itâs a great machine. It feels completely solid and the ease of moving it even once itâs setup is thoroughly impressive. The menus are intuitive and easy to navigate, and the presence of the quick-shutoff chain is minimal and easy to use when wanted. The only physical things I would like to see different would mostly be with the app functionality, eg the complete lack of integration for iPhoneâs health stats app, the lack of a search function in the guided workouts, the inability (to my knowledge) to map out custom workouts ahead of time with sliders or some form of paragraphic interface, and that it canât turn the unitâs display screen when the app is in use. The incline works beautifully and smoothly, plus is gradual enough to not risk a fall or injury if you arenât paying attention.Very satisfied with my purchase

  Let me start off by saying that I used a treadmill from Walmart for over 4 years before I purchased this, so I was ready for any improvement.I am not a runner or an avid work out person, I wanted a nice treadmill for walking , light jogging, and incline training.I have used this treadmill for a month now and I absolutely love it, I actually forward to working on it.Itâs easy to use and comfortable to walk on, no issues at all.I did choose the trial IFit membership and not sure why so many other reviewers have opted out. Itâs a fantastic feature! And itâs free for a year, why would you pass it up?Yes, you have to give them your credit card information, thatâs typical of any trial product or membership you choose.So far, I have hiked along the Grand Canyon, around Niagara Falls, and Scotland.  The IFit offers activities for all levels, all over the world. Workouts go by quickly because youâre so in to the scenery, and the trainers keep you motivated and offer great training tips.What I really like is that I can manually adjust the speed and incline, if the trainers are going too fast and still follow along.For example, I chose a run across the Grand Canyon , but the trainer was going at speed of 5.1. I canât go that fast , so I set it to a lower speed and was still able to enjoy the scenery and inclines.I know there are other treadmills that offer fans and a nice sound system and such, but this fits my needs perfectly.I would recommend this and the IFit wholeheartedly.On a side note, it took my wife about three hours to put together.I also paid a little extra for delivery person to carry it downstairs for me, worth every penny!

    Love the treadmill AFTER the assembly ordeal was over
  
",4.0,M. Wilkins,"Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  PRO: The treadmill is very substantial, heavy, and doesn't move at all on our cement floor. Once we familiarized ourselves with all the steps to activate iFit and started working out, absolutely no problems. I enjoy using iFit, my husband prefers just walking on the oval track and listening to his own music with headphones. It's possible to use it without iFit, but worth trying it for the free trial period. I find it makes the exercise time pass quickly, walking in London, Hawaii, New Zealand, Petra, etc.CONS:  We are over 65, so maybe should have expected we couldnât assemble this without help. (It took nearly an hour to unpack it) That said, we gamely tried. Got as far as Step 3. The bolts holding all this steel together just wouldnât go in. Did we have the wrong tools, not enough muscle, who knows. We hired someone who got it up and running in 2 hours. The heart rate handles you hold onto with both hands weren't accurate, 70 bpm? Really? ð In no universe am I an elite athlete, lol.BOTTOM LINE:  definitely a good purchase and is perfect for this epidemic lockdown when leaving the house to exercise is not an option for us.

    Just A Simple Treadmill but Beware of iFit Trick
  
",3.0,Gregory Levins,"Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  I see all the commercials with the twenty-year old athletes running on their treadmills with intense trainers engaged with them.  I am too old for that and did not need that.  What I needed was a good quality simple treadmill so I could walk at a good pace comfortably.  I am recovering from triple bypass surgery and my old treadmill of 15 years gave out.  The treadmill market is confusing and saturated, but I feel the NordicTrack T6.5 is exactly what I need.  I have been using it almost daily for a month and am pleased with the quality, performance, comfort, ease of use and appearance.  The one thing I absolutely did not like is the iFit situation.  Per the treadmill instructions, you have to setup a free 30-day membership trial in order to activate the treadmill.  As I stated before, I am recovering from heart surgery and just needed a treadmill and subsequently forgot about the free trial.  I was charged an annual membership of $190.  I called iFit customer service and they cancelled my membership but will only refund $97. I paid $100 for one day of membership.  I would rate the treadmill itself higher than I did, but since NordicTrack wants to bundle iFit into the purchase, then my rating will reflect what I think of that scam.

  Bolts and screws an absolute nightmare to get in during assembly. Won't line up properly and feels like you're stripping the threads. 2 days running on it and the belt slides to the left and/or right. Followed instructions and it seems to hold for a while then slips again. Then heard a squeaking noise coming from front end. Called Icon customer service and after a video call it was determined that I need a new roller. Attached are pics of the old roller. This is obviously a refurbish, or they just beat the heck out of it during assembly. They offered to send me the roller, a pretty major part, and have me install it myself. I declined and asked to send a tech or I was returning. Good customer service I'll say, but absolutely horrible quality. Pretty unimpressed with Nordic Track and their $1000 treadmill.

  This treadmill was the biggest mistake ever. It arrived smash to pieces, with the screws and plastic pieces everywhere. Assembly was a pain and definitely requires two people. Instructions were unclear looked rushed. Customer service is nonexistent and requires preregistration of product just to get ""assistance"". It was an ordeal just to get replacement parts for the damaged good that is this treadmill, which took 2-3 weeks to arrive. So I have this smashed hunk of junk just sitting there collecting dust. Once the smashed parts were replaced, the product requires you to purchase an exercise plan just to operate, but that can be bypassed by pressing and holding the blue button on the panel. The treading feels loose and has too much slack, the display is awkwardly low especially when incline is changed, and worst of all, the buttons are not very responsive and slippery. Its always a guess trying to change the speed or incline.This product arrived defective as well. Every time the incline is lowered, there's a horrendous snapping sound that rocks the machine. Clearly not normal and the company refuses to fix or replace this defective part. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT OR ANYTHING SOLD BY NORDIC TRACK. AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE.

  Amazon was great on this delivery. The first one was damaged before I got it- It was returned before it even made it to me and I was notified via email. I contacted Amazon support- the lady was GREAT, she had a new one on the way the same day.The delivery company was great as well, the two delivery guys brought it in the house and down to my family room. Please tip your delivery guys- this thing weighs a ton.Took about an hour to unbox, lay it out, build and cleanup. No need to use a professional setup person if you can read some basic instructions and use a screwdriver and turn a wrench.Once together, it works great. The big reason I went with this over a few of the others that were less expensive was to be able to adjust the incline while using it versus manually setting it. That was worth the extra $200 alone.The only negative- the heart rate monitor seems to read my heart rate at about  50% of what it really is  2/3 of the time. I have a message out to Nordic Tracks customer service so weâll see if there is a fix. Could be user error but I donât think so.No need to join the iFit program that comes with it unless you want to pay the yearly fee for it. Hold down the iFit/ Sync button  while powering it on the first time and it bypasses it. Look below a few reviews, thereâs one that walks you through it. You only have to do this once. The speakers arenât very good, but I didnât expect much there.Overall, great purchase and Iâd recommend it highly- if youâre on the fence buy it.

    This Treadmill Did Not Disappoint
  
",5.0,Anne McCarty,"Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  There's a reason why Nordic Track has a reputation for high quality.  I wanted a decent treadmill but like most folks on a budget, I figured I'd have to compromise as low price and decent quality is sometimes an impossible match.  This treadmill is everything I was hoping for.  It is sturdy, roomy and well-built. The Ifit membership is a nice feature if you're interested in special training programs but you can still use the treadmill if you are not. Ignore the decals that state that you have to register the machine in order for it to work. Simply hold down the Ifit logo for 30 seconds and the treadmill will start right up - no credit card info or registration required.  I LOVE this machine.  Mega value for the price.  Has all the features I want.  Very happy with this purchase.

    Functions like a treadmill
  
",5.0,Yanaseza,"Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  Amazon prime delivery was on time and efficient. No shipping damage, all the bits and pieces that were supposed to be in the box were in the box. You do need a Phillips head screwdriver and adjustable wrench for assembly.I, 55f and the only one in the house who reads instructions and makes sure all the pieces are there first, decided to put it together myself. It didn't feel like 2.5 hours but that's how long it took. Did I complain? A little. In Step 6 I carefully loosened/tightened four pre-attached screws in the handrails to get the larger screws/washers in place. Turn the page for Step 8 to read ""if there are four screws pre-attached inside ... remove and discard them..."" grumble. It's recommended you have a person help you hold to attach the console assembly but it's doable by yourself if you're flexible. I did need the second person for steps 13-15 (of 17) to hold the belt frame up while I attached the crossbar and storage latch.Yes, there are stickers and ""warnings"" stating that the treadmill is locked and will not start until activated at ifit.com. You do NOT need to enter your credit card information (find the small font that says skip or no thank you). You will still get the one month free trial. I do not like that I cannot input individual stats (height, weight, etc.) into the treadmill directly. Those fancy features come with the ifit app subscription. I did poke around the iFit programs a bit - would have been nice for it to limit what I could see to this particular machine; in other words there were plenty of programs that incline to 18% or 34% automatically - useless for this machine as it only goes to 10%. But, the walks/runs that take you on tours of places are neat. Would I buy into the subscription? Not unless it synchs with my Fitbit which it does not. Speaking of which, the treadmill pulse bar monitor and my Fitbit read are fairly close. I'm not sure about distance/steps because I keep forgetting to check...which is why synching would be nice.The machine lifts out of the way and lowers easily (not a feature we use regularly but it's there if needed). As with every other piece of exercise equipment we've ever owned, the built in speakers are not awesome. The lip at the bottom of the console holds phone/tablet admirably, if I could design it myself I would have it at the top so that I didn't have to look down to see my phone (as the ifit trainer is telling me to keep my head up).NOTE: none of the assembly steps in the manual indicate to attach the safety key. It's just pictured hanging off the pulse bar in the final step (it did not come attached, it's wrapped in a small bag with the screws etc.). You do need to have the red safety key in place on the pulse bar to make the machine work (there's a small indented area with a key logo). The important emergency information on how the *safety* part of the key works (if the clip is attached to you) is highlighted in the manual under HOW TO TURN ON THE POWER. Be safe.So far, we've had four family members of varying sizes use the machine on full workouts - walkers and runners. Haven't wanted to adjust cushioning, there's been no belt slippage and there have been no weird noises. For the price, we recommend it.UPDATE 3 months later: after browsing the iFit programs for a few days I found the functionality between the app and the treadmill to be what I needed in my life. I have an annual subscription (still don't need to leave your CC info with them permanently). Because I'm not just staring at the wall while using the machine I look forward to hopping on 5-6 days a week faithfully, traveling around the world - heck, I've even done a few virtual 5k races! Machine is still solid - I use it the most, but my husband is on it 3-4x/week and a teenager too. No squeaks or issues thus far.

  Bought this 3 years ago along with a service agreement that had a free lube/maintenance service call as part of the agreement.  They call to renew my agreement which reminds me to ask for the free service.  The service guy comes out does his thing and leaves.  Two days later I go to use it for the first time.  It turns on and shuts off again.  Call Nordik track and she says sounds like the circuit board went out since he was there and you still have 30 days to renew the agreement which runs out in 2 weeks.  I said let's let the service guy come back since it worked before he came and now it doesn't.  She says if he can't get back in 2 weeks you won't be covered.  Why would I renew an agreement with a company that doesn't do right by their customers.  Better to just put it against a new treadmill from a different company since the console was outdated when I got it three years ago.  UPDATE: WHILE THE LADY ON THE NORDIC TRACK ""HELP LINE"" WAS ONLY INTERESTED IN SELLING ME AN EXTENSION TO MY WARRANTY THE 3RD PARTY SERVICE GUY CALLED ME BACK AND WAS ABLE TO HELP ME TROUBLE SHOOT THE PROBLEM OVER THE PHONE.  YOU WOULD THINK NORDIC TRACK WOULD OFFER TECHNICAL SUPPORT.  Further update: The machine still works well. Looks like they jacked the price since Covid hit tho.  This was a good purchase but the warranty and the company support is worthless.

  I started walking and using StepBet to challenge myself during COVID quarantine.  As we approached the cooler, wetter weather I was worried that I would have trouble keeping up with my step challenges, so I was happy to find this treadmill.  Reviews here and in other places are great and it is EXACTLY what I needed to keep up with my challenges.  I love that I can put my iPad on the ledge and watch something while I walk, or set my phone there while I listen to a podcast or audiobook. I can walk at a pretty fast pace with no major noise or vibration.  My daughter runs on it and I can hardly tell she is running from the other room.I'll admit it was a challenge to put together... definitely need 2 people, but soo worth it!  I have not activated the iFit membership but I am considering it.Overall, this is a great treadmill to use at home when the weather makes it tough to get outside.

  I received my treadmill on August 13.  The delivery company was great and was willing to place it anywhere in the house that I wanted it.  I opened the box and was able to put it together by myself.  I wanted one that could fold up so that I didn't lose a lot of floor space when not using it.  My only complaint is that the tiny wheels used to move it are located in the wrong place.  I feel they should be on the front where most of the weight of the machine is so that when I fold it and try to roll it I do not have to use a lot of muscle to get it moved.  With the wheels on the back I have to pull the weight of the machine towards me to roll it.  My previous folding treadmill (different brand) had the wheels on the front.

  If you watch the prices, you can get this on great sales at certain times of the year (particularly around holidays). The motor is plenty powerful for what I need it for (jogging and power-walking), and the running surface is comfortable. I am pleased that I can continue my workouts in the colder weather months. You do not have to subscribe to iFit to use the machine, you can always click on Manual Workout. But connecting the treadmill to WIFI is still worthwhile without the iFit subscription, as you do get access to some free ""included workouts"". Also, I paid for the delivery to room of choice, but the carrier that delivers it will only deliver to doorstep or garage currently because of COVID-19. But Amazon refunded me the $20 that I paid for delivery to room of choice. Can't speak to the ease of assembly, as I paid someone locally to do it (and they ended up taking it to the room of choice for me).

  Really enjoying this treadmill. This is not a reflection of treadmill itself, but there was some not superior service with the delivery company in terms of miscommunication on delivery dates and finding the delivery location. That aside it did take me a few hours to assemble (by myself with hubby helping when I needed parts held), watching some YouTube videos and Googling spots I was stumbled at along the way. A few of the screws were hard to fit in the holes but were able to make it work. Assembly was the thing I was most worried about, but once that was complete it's been a great tread. I've used it so far for running classes on an app and enjoy the quick jump buttons for speed and incline. This model works perfect for what I need it for. Will continue to see how the tread holds up as well an any maintenance needed (hopefully minimal to none).

  This is a good, solid home treadmill. Great value for the price. Stable with plenty of power for walking and running.Pros:-Easy to assemble.-Simple to use. (And easy to bypass the iFIT, if  you don't want to subscribe.)-NordicTrack customer support is fantastic. We had some issues and their response was superior. NOTE: due to the pandemic, the phone wait (and wait for an online chat) was over an hour. So I just put the call on speaker and went about my business until they were able to answer.Cons:-Front motor hood accent sticks out too far onto the walking belt and is easy to get your feet caught on and trip.-Side handrails are only 12"" long so they do not provide good support, since you have to walk pretty far back, due to the hood accent.-The heart rate monitor is very inaccurate and does not work much of the time; additionally, because the hood accent sticks out so far, it is dangerous to hold onto that for stability, while walking or running. This is not a major issue as I have a pulse oximeter that I use, when I want.-The ""key/clip"" (that you hook to your clothes to shut off power, in case you fall) is made of plastic and breaks easily.We purchased the extended warranty, but have yet to use that. Our current issues were all covered under the basic NordicTrack warranty.

  First of all the size of the box is 33"" x 73"" x 11"" and weighs about 200 lbs.  The delivery company was terrible and I had to work directly with Amazon to resolve issues with them.  It took two people to move the platform to the room where it was to stay.  I'm 65years old and was able to put all of it together but the fold bar by myself although I will admit having another person to help with the console would have been nice.  It would also have been helpful if it was noted in the order description that a surge protector was required so it could have been ordered at the same time.  Once I got it altogether I did get it connected to iFit easy enough with my phone but ended up getting an Android tablet to use a bigger screen with it.  I like how quiet the treadmill is. I like that the iFit program automatically adjusts speed and elevation.  I wasn't planning to continue iFit after the free month but I've decided that I like the program.  I think it's a great treadmill that does everything I need and the price was great.  I'm glad I didn't pay extra for the bigger screen version because the tablet was a better buy to work with it and more versatile too. I would recommend this to anyone that is not into aggressive training. You'd probably want a more expensive and powerful device.

Press the Display button repeatedly until the desired workout information appears.""Did you see that ""your pace"" in the quote above? Miles per hour is not a pace for a runner or walker. I need minutes per mile. I did press the display button repeatedly and the pace never appeared.Now if someone can show me where I missed it, I will happily change my review to 5 stars. Maybe I can rig it somehow with a smart phone.

  Nice looking treadmill, folds down and up very easy with the tension rod, it carries the weight so that is nice.  Putting together was a little frustrating as some of the screws did not fit and had to use my own.  I read this in some other reviews as well.  Especially the grounding screw provided was completely wrong size

It's well made and sturdy.I would also like to confirm that YOU DO NOT NEED A MEMBERSHIP! As stated previously,  press and hold the ifit button for about 30 seconds and it will work!Enjoy!

  well shipping went well got a tracker app. that showed map and # of stops before me and they texted 1/2 hour before getting here. I did not pay for it to be taken to room of choice or put together. It is 200+ lbs but NP with 2 floor carts and no steps.  spent maybe 2 hrs putting it together with stopping now and then did it by myself with no problems but if your not mechanically inclined 2 people could make it better. thank God i seen all the post about the way to skip there IFIT crap by holding the IFIT tab for 30 sec.  only bad things so far I see is the heart rate bar is in not the best place should be on the arms. I have a fit bits so that's no big deal and them things are never 100% as it is they say you can link your fit bits to it but its not picking mine up. Wish it would have come with a lube kit as well or at min. lube. Over all I would buy it over but time will tell if that changes will update if things go bad

  Let's start by saying"" This treadmill is b.o.m.b!!. I got it delevered and had to pay extra $20 bucks to have it taken to a specific area which was the basement. The equipment was super heavy even for the two husky men that dropped it off. Then the next day a guy came to put it together, It was brutal to watch him with all those screws, and I had to assist because you need two people, especially when putting the electrical frame together. Anyways, it came with the one year I-fit sub, and let me tell you how Geeked I was after activation. O.M.G , you can run, walk anywhere in the world and it plays music as your coach is talkin which you can adjust. It has a create button that give you live gps routes to any place in the WORLD. I create a walk through Israel, like really!!. You mean I can walk anywhere in the world ! You know how much money I can save?  I walked down the streets and inclined pass shops, this is some real live ""Jetson Livin."" I love it, this is hands down the best investment. Worth every penny.

  I had reservations about buying a treadmill online without trying it first. Iâve never owned one and only used commercial grade treads in gyms and hotels. I was thrilled that this one feels just as solid and no louder. Assembled by one person, except for one step. Itâs really heavy but drug and slid down the stairs easily, ha! I love the iFit app and connecting it via Bluetooth. The speed and incline is controlled via the app. Even if I decide to change the speed manually the app still changes the incline and vice versa. I set my iPad in the console and run through Newport Beach, Germany and Montana. The bed is nice and long. Iâm 5â3 and 125 and run anywhere from an 8:30 to 10:00 mile depending on the day.

    Nice product encased in nonsense
  
",1.0,Mychal Hunter,"Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  The product itself is nice. The problem is that once you purchase the treadmill you should just be able to assemble it and use it. The assembly is tricky at times, especially alone, but do-able. When the setup is complete you then need to get on to a computer and register it with Ifit, which will require a credit card. Then you have to download an app, watch an introductory video, create a profile, connect your phone to your machine and activate it. I have seen some videos showing people how to unlock the machine by holding the IFit button, that must have been corrected on Nordic Track because that did not work for me. Fortunately, the cancellation process is not very difficult. Ifit.com, hover over your name, settings, membership, end benefits and then end benefits through about 5 more ""please stay"" menus.Here's the reason for 1*. I don't appreciate being held hostage in the use of the machine that I just shelled out nearly $800 for. Who are you guys? The American government selling insurance? When this machine gets older and breaks down, I can assure Nordic Track and Ifit that I will not be going through their circus again. I don't need to pay $15 a month to be told how to run on a treadmill.The features are nice though, aux in, ipod compatible, speakers, a shelf for my ipad so i can watch basketball or whatever. Nice machine, just feels like a scam when you can't turn it out and run.

  I was very excited to get this, but when it arrived it was heavily damaged. One of the foot rails(sitting next to the treadmill in the image) was completely broken off and the motor hood has a crack in it along with a very ugly scuff.  Strangely - the shock absorptions looked like they were in bad shape as well, but I think that was caused by whatever caused the rail to break off the treadmill. One of the foot covers(seen sitting on top of the machine) was damaged so bad that I was finding  pieces of broken plastic throughout the box.  There were also minor damaged areas throughout like the motor hood was warped due to the crack making so the hood no longer fit as it should onto the frame of the treadmill, the holes were certain bolts were screwed in were warped, the underside of the treadmill looked like it may have been damaged as well. I have no idea if it had any mechanical issues, so I really cant comment on that considering I did not even get past simply opening the box. This is going to be returned to Amazon.

  Overall great buy. The machine functions well and was pretty simple for myself and my fiance to put together. Took about an hour, instructions were clear and simple to follow.I've been using the machine on all levels, sometimes doing intervals at max speed and then decreasing it. Sometimes longer moderate paced runs. Sometimes just walking. Never have had any issues at any specific speed or setting.Speakers work well, not gonna be of a surround sound quality but for music while running works good enough.My only issue with the entire device is you have to sign up for iFit in order to turn the device on. This requires a credit card to start the free trial (at least mine required it). I immediately cancelled the plan so it wouldn't charge me but I hate being forced to do stuff like that, especially when it's to just turn on a treadmill.Device good, speakers good, overall I'd buy again.

  I ran 9 miles a day on my previous C600 and if needed could pause at any time and resume a run. I just called customer service to see if I was missing something as I can't resume my runs when I pause them and I was informed you can only do this if you have iFit. Having a feature like this intentionally disabled for an avid runner is abhorrent. I cannot stress how much I do not recommend this treadmill for this reason alone, especially if you do long distance runs.

  My wife is a gym rat, and with the quarantine going to the gym is an impossibility. She decided she wanted a treadmill and wanted to cheap out with one of the really cheap treadmills on Amazon, but I did some research and decided it'd be better to not cheap out so much and get this NordicTrack instead.I'm happy we did. I wasn't exercising at all prior to getting the NordicTrack but now that we've got one in the apartment we both use it every day to run a couple miles. So far so good! Honestly I can't really tell the difference between this machine and ones I used to use at the gym, so I think it's pretty great.I hear people talking about wanting more expensive treadmills that are quieter, and, sure, this one is a bit loud, but it's not really a big deal at all. If I'm in the bedroom and she's running in the living room, I mostly just hear her foot falls and not the treadmill. If she's in the living room watching TV while I'm running, she just turns up the TV a bit. My AirPod Pros also silence it. So if you're concerned about noise, I don't think you should be too worried about it. Plus we haven't had any complaints from neighbors or similar.This treadmill will be getting a lot of use from us, it definitely won't be turning into a coat hanger. I'll end up purchasing the extended warranty for sure, and we'll see how well it can keep up with two dedicated runners hammering away at it!

  I purchased this treadmill just after all of the Covid lock-downs began almost a year ago.  I figured going into this whole situation that I'd either gain 50 pounds or lose 50 pounds.  Ha!  I was about 290 lbs at that time and can confirm at this time I'm about 60 lbs less due to ALOT of walking on this treadmill!  When I purchased, I knew I'd need a solid machine just because of my current weight at the time.  While there have been plenty of cheat days between then and now... I can confirm this treadmill is solid and well powered for my needs.  I'm not a runner but maybe someday.  So, I mainly use for very long walks at a faster pace.  I will toss in a little incline from time to time.  My main focus had been keeping myself in fat burning heart rate (you can look that up... easy to calculate).  I started at just a few miles a day (usually 5 - 6 days a week).  Now, I'm up to 8 - 10 miles a day.  I did purchase the added 3 year extended warrantee because the price was good and I will take them up on their preventative maintenance once I hit the 1 year mark of ownership.  Having used extensively, I can very much confirm it's a solid machine and I feel very good about this purchase.  Good luck to you... just keep walking... or running!

  First the product came with dents and some breakage . I called amazon and they offered me partial refund.We thought the damage just looks cosmetic so product might not still works . So we moved the 300lb trade mill to basement . After hours of assembly we have to know that treadmill just does not start.Amazon tried calling the manufacturer but did not get any response back. Now we had to return the treadmill and the issue is its very heavy and taking it out from basement is just not possible for me.Amazon is saying you have to put it to front porch to get it picked up by carrier.I would recommend not to buy this and buy one from somewhere else that offer free assembly , so it the treadmill does not work you can just ask them to take it back.

  We like the treadmill. it works well and having it at home is very convenient. First of all, the product is heavy. If you are going to assemble it yourselves, make sure 2-3 people who can lift 200 lbs available to help. The assembly is hard if you don't get the angles right. It took us almost 7 hours to get everything right as the screws won't tighten and console won't fit between the bars unless you get the  angles right. Folding is easy. It is worth buying the assembly for 100$(or 67$ if there is a deal). You don't need ifit but the instruction makes you think you need it. Press on the ifit logo for 20-30 seconds and you can use the manual mode with no issues. Overall except for assembly, we like this treadmill

  Along with the NordicTrack S22i bike, I purchased the T Series 9.5 treadmill from Nordictrack.  Just like the bike, I am super impressed with this treadmill.  Prior to purchase, I reviewed a LOT of different types/models of indoor equipment.  I wanted to have an interactive experience that will keep me both entertained and focused on goals while I exercise.  This treadmill does JUST that.  The screen is large, but not massive in size.  That is okay, though - it is plenty big to take in the scenery as you follow your trainer.  There are hundreds of training sessions, with more added all the time.  Feel like walking?  Have a historian walk you around the pyramids of Egypt.  Ready for a run?  Train for a marathon in Utah.  Feeling challenged?  Hike up a mountainside trail!  The trainers encourage you along the way, and when their terrain changes, so does the incline / decline resistance on this equipment.  Onboard stats are right at the top, so you know how you are performing.  I especially like the addition of Google Maps!  I can create my own trail and see the sights in places I have never been.  The equipment has a solid frame, and the overall footprint is not so massive.  Great price for this equipment!  Highly recommend!

  This treadmill was delivered promptly.  I arranged for the assembly through Amazon and I'm glad I did!  The technician knew exactly what to do and it was pretty complicated.  I usually do my own assembly but was glad I didn't this time.  The treadmill is a very solid and serious machine - nothing flimsy or cheap about it.  It has basic functions, which was all I wanted.  I just get on and walk for a while.  The incline feature is a bonus.  I have it placed in front of a TV in my office, so I watch ""my shows"" while I walk.  The only negative is that it is quite loud - it makes a loud whining sound - enough that I couldn't hear my TV.  I solved the problem by purchasing a set of bluetooth headphones for the TV.  Solution works great.  I'm very motivated to use this machine and am enjoying it a lot!

  As we move into the winter months I wanted to have a treadmill that I could run on instead of running in the dark.  I've never been much of a treadmill runner, but with COVID-19 I thought this would be a good addition to my ""fitness room"" (aka my basement).  It arrived a day later than scheduled and I was very worried that it wouldn't be placed in my basement - so worried that I called the company.  Thankfully they still provide this service in VA and three guys carried it to my basement.  The box was damaged and I took a bunch of pictures in case the treadmill was damaged as well.  I was able to unpack and put together 90% of the treadmill by myself.  I watched a YouTube video to get an idea on what I needed to do.  Best advice was to lay out everything, watch the video (although it wasn't the exact same model) and then the written instructions made a lot of sense.  I needed another set of hands for the console and the hydraulic lift.  I received it on 9/23, finished putting it together by 11:30 that evening and have used it three times since, both running and walking.  The right hand cup holder seems to be the only part that was damaged - otherwise it works great (for me).  I have a portable fan set up and I can access online classes either through my phone or TV.  It's basic, the tread is wide and long enough for me (I'm 5' 5"") and it feels very sturdy.  Nothing fancy, but I'm happy with the purchase - no buyers remorse.

I never received what I was promised. It's been over 5 months and I haven't received the treadmill maintenance kit.Original Review:I rarely write reviews for products, but I made an exception for this treadmill. It's everything I could have ever wanted in a treadmill.ASSEMBLY - With the exception of one step (attaching the folding lever), I was able to assemble the treadmill on my own. The instructions were clear and easy to follow. No parts were missing and everything was labeled appropriately.SCREEN AND TOUCH KEYS - The 10-inch screen has a crisp and clear picture, excellent touch response, and is very easy to use. All controls on the treadmill are easy to use and well laid out.MECHANICAL - The treadmill is nice and smooth. I especially love the cushion adjustment which helps reduce or decrease treadmill firmness. It's great for me since I have knee issues. Walking and running on the treadmill feels akin to commercial machines at a gym. My mom even said the quality and size reminded her of something at a gym.iFit - The iFit software is awesome! I will definitely renew my membership after the free year concludes that was included in the treadmill order. Two of my favorite workouts are the Mt. Fuji hike and Easter Island tour. iFit trainers are incredibly engaging and make working out fun and educational. There are tons of other workout options to choose from, including running, 5k training, strength workouts, etc. Plus, new workouts are routinely added.I'm really glad I decided to make this purchase.

I donât like that you have to sign up for an iFit subscription in order to activate the machine...it gives 30 day trial free, but I didnât want to sign up because Iâll just have to cancel before the free trial expires.I also had an issue with amazon not initially shipping my item on time. I had scheduled assembly for the day after arrival, but I didnât get a notification that the item was delayed...then for some reason the extra shipping I paid to have the treadmill delivered to another room in my house got removed from the order. When the delivery people came, they told me I didnât pay for extra shipping but I told them I did without knowing it had been cancelled. They were super rude about it, and I went back and looked after ward and saw that it was removed. I wasnât looking to get something for free, but that shouldnât have been an issue in the first place when I had already paid.I have 4 stars not because of the product, but because the process with amazon wasnât very smooth.

    Gym-quality treadmill, very satisified
  
",5.0,eubeania,"Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2018","









  
  
    
  The treadmill is heavy, and I needed the help of a friend to assemble it; took about 2 hours to assemble, and the instructions were pretty easy to follow. When properly assembled, it's very sturdy. Because of its weight, I don't often move it (the little wheels might work on a harder surface, but we have it on an treadmill mat on carpet), so I placed it in a location where it can stay there for a long time. It folds easily, and storing it folded does save some space. Overall, I am EXTREMELY SATISFIED. The tread surface is wide and it's long enough to jog or run comfortably. The speed and incline controls work smoothly. I tend to use my own headphones rather than connecting to the unit's speakers, and I rarely use the pre-programmed workouts, so can't really comment on those, but they are there if you want them. The tread does make some noise when in use, but I would say it's relatively quiet. The time/speed/miles/calories readouts seem to be accurate. The ""pulse/heart rate"" readout jumps around a bit, but it still gives me a fairly accurate idea of my maximum heart rate. Bottom line is, this treadmill suits me just fine. It's a gym-quality piece of exercise equipment at an affordable price. I've owned treadmills that cost 2 or 3 times what this one cost (@ $650 USD), and I would rate this one as good as or better than the more expensive ones I've owned. (I'm a 60-ish female ex-athlete who is trying to get back into shape, and this treadmill suits my needs as well as those of my ultra-fit housemate. Would recommend it for beginners as well as seasoned treadmill users.)

  This review is just for purchasing off amazon. I have bought Nordic track products before directly from them. It would always take weeks for delivery they would only do curbside unless you pay a bunch extra and when I had issues with my machines they would always get looked at by a technician and they would say nothing was wrong. So I havenât purchased any Nordic track items in a few years. That being said. I felt safer purchasing from amazon and 2 day delivery hell yeah I gotta get some of this quarantine thick off lol. Paid 655 for a treadmill with auto incline up to 10 miles per hour and the higher weight capacity also meaning itâs more sturdy the price canât be beaten. Amazons delivery was impeccable they had this delivered to my doorstep up 6 flights of stairs in less then 48 hours without a dent crack or anything.Assembly: I am a single woman so I assembled this alone found a video on YouTube that was super helpful. But even listening to all the tips the heart monitor support bar gave me grief did not align properly. Even tho I had not tightened the bottom legs and could freely move them. Other than that it was pretty easy to do alone expect the safety bar drop system but I managed to get it done.The machine: so after set up I did the Ifit bypass which worked fine. The machine started right up I did here a very faint bang sound during rotation but while on the machine itâs none existent and I donât know if itâs just this motor very faint. The incline worked great right out of box. I have already done 2 hour workouts on this treadmill and itâs been great sturdy the belt isnât slipping quiet I can hear my iPad and itâs not even plugged into the console speakers yet. I am 5â7  and the belt width and length is great I donât feel like I am hitting the sides or going off the back or the front of my feet hitting the motor cover nothing. If you are gonna buy a Nordic track I suggest doing it thru amazon!I took off one star just because like everyone else I do think itâs pretty sleazy to put a red piece of paper saying your machine is locked and Cannot be used until you register for if it.Overall very happy with my purchase already feel better working out! I hope this machine last a few years.

  This is the perfect treadmill. It is exactly what I was looking for. I havenât set up iFit, but so far itâs very smooth and it works well. The speed and incline levels are great with many options. Assembling it wasnât too difficult, but of course, it takes patience. I did have a hard time with the console, but customer service was able to video chat with me. They found the problem and a solution for it right away.  I really love how it folds up easily and unfolds on its own. If youâre thinking of buying it, just do it! You wonât regret it.

  I really like this treadmill a lot!  I'd done my research so my expectations were high, but when I got this assembled it was even nicer than I'd anticipated.  It looks great (closer to a gym treadmill than a personal treadmill) and is very comfortable to walk on for long stretches.  And I would definitely recommend getting iFit along with it as I'm really enjoying those workouts.  The only minor complaint I have is assembly.  I'm not technically-inclined so after taking a quick look at all the parts and the instructions, I quickly made an appointment with someone from Task Rabbit to come assemble this for me.  However if you are technically-inclined, assembly probably won't be a problem for you.

  So far Iâm enjoying the treadmill. Itâs louder than I expected but with headphones or the tv on itâs not noticeable for me. This is my first in home treadmill. I think the noise is probably the same as youâd expect in a gym but theyâre generally noisy so itâs probably just me.Iâm 5â4â and when I try to hold the hand rail heart monitors my feet graze the front cover on the track when walking. Not an issue for me because I plan to use a chest heart rate monitor.I do love the large monitor/tablet and the ease of selecting speed and incline.I did need assistance assembling when it came to the raise/lower mechanism. Otherwise I assembled the rest by myself.

  This treadmill model is not a luxury model, but it works very well for its purpose, as I am not a professional runner I personally did not want to spend more than $800 for a treadmill, but I wanted a reliable treadmill, so after spending hours comparing different brands, I  decided to buy this model as it was on sale with good reviews and honestly I love it.The fact it has ifit made a difference, even though at the beginning I was quite reluctant to subscribe, after I tried it, I really enjoy it, so I enrolled.

  Great treadmill. Love it! Love the incline, love the fold up feature, and love how sturdy it feels. It's a treadmill so it's not whisper quiet but it doesn't sound like a giant motor running either so win!Hated putting it together. Wrong screws, bent parts, and horrible diagrams to follow. Assembly took 4.5 hours with another person. If we were not strong people, idk if we could gave gotten the display bar installed. It had to be forced.We used another screw for the ground. It has worked perfectly. Don't spend an hour trying to figure out how to make the screw they provide fit. It doesn't! We found a youtube video finally that addressed the missing screw issue.One thing I don't like is that the belt slides too easily from left to right. It hasnt caused any problems yet, I just worry the side to side movement may wear it down faster.

  Terrific treadmill for this price point. Is it a $6000 gym treadmill? No. Can you run on it at 12.5 mph? No. Does it give a great walking or jogging workout ? Absolutely! Don't want prerecorded people on a screen yelling at you to go faster and push through it? Don't want to pay $15-$50 a month for that privilege? Just need 20 preset programs or none, up to 10Â° incline and 10 mph with a nice sturdy machine. Then this is for you, like it's for me. Assembly took a while by myself. Pay careful attention to the 3 different size volts used to attach the arms. Very quiet treadmill. Oh and if you don't want to pay for ifit, just depress the ifit logo for 30 seconds or so after you turn on the on switch at the front bottom of the machine. Lastly, only thing I'd like is a little more treadmill space at the front as sometime my foot catches the plastic in the front. Enjoy!

  The treadmill is good and I like it, but customer support is a nightmare to deal with. I contacted them on June 18th for support as my treadmill is starting to break down and the belt has started to rip. I have gotten replies for more information shortly after but nothing came of it. Its July 29th over a month later and I didn't get any more replies or any other information about fixing my machine either.In short if it starts to break down like mine then that's it your on your own. The machine is under full warranty but they simply wont reply so what's the point of buying warranty if they will ignore you. They don't have a customer support phone number so your only way is by email. My warranty ends in August and my fear is they will wait till after my warranty end date to say its not under warranty anymore.Beware if you plan on having this for a long time or a heavy user, might be a better idea to go with another brand if warranty and customer support matter to you.

  I bought this on prime day with professional installation and 3 year warranty.Delivery:Delivered on time. I live on 3rd floor of an apartment and two guys dragged the shipment on stairs to deliver us. Looking at it I was afraid it had any damage and it turned out to be okay.Assembly:Amazon asked for 3 date/time slots for assembly and they chose my 2nd preference. I got an email of the assembly time and contact details. He came on time and the assembly took <1 hr (out time - in time). He also trashed the box. He didn't show me how to skip iFit and make it up & running. He told me to call customer service and they could help. I am glad that I read comment on Amazon and was able to skip iFit by pressing it for 30 seconds with red safety button on.Treadmill:I have used it for 5 days now and I am not liking it much. It makes lot of noise. I never had knee pain before. I am only 125lb and I walk 2 miles everyday in downtown to and from work and I had used lot of other treadmills in gym and I never had this problem. After using this, I was feeling uncomfortable from day 1. I was only walking at 2.8 - 3.5 miles/hour and didn't run at all. I wasn't sure if this is a faulty one OR problem with all. I use manual workout and I didn't find any pause button. Touching other buttons accidentally also stops the workout. It is frustrating.Pros:Wide beltEasy to foldNot so difficult to move for its sizeGood & big consoleCons:Loud noiseBad for your knees.No pauseTouching other buttons might stop the workout.Finally, I am at a point that I would never want to rely solely on Amazon reviews to buy anything as it looks like some of the reviews might be paid. I am very much disappointed with this. I am wondering how these kind of products are approved. I will try for another week and see if there will be any change and update it.

  Assembly - 3/5. This was a PITA to put together...it's the only piece of workout equipment that we've had that truly required two people for assembly. And it took about two hours to finish assembly.Machine - amazing. I searched and searched for a treadmill, which during COVID is nearly impossible to come by one that's in stock and costs less than $2k. I finally found this one and was so impressed with the iFit screen set up. I want an effortless walking routine where I don't have to pay attention to time, incline, speed, etc. I just want the machine to do it for me, sort of like a natural walk. I'm happy that a one year iFit membership came with this, and plan to continue that membership after the first year. I am also incredibly happy with the quick responses of the buttons, the clarity of the screen and sound, and the size. It's also pretty quiet for a treadmill.

  So for me it arrived on time and they broung it to my apartment which was awesome.The instructions were slightly hard but not too much. I put the whole thing together practically myself besides tightening the bolts or screws then my husband did that part.It took a couple of days for me to put it together given kids and working as well but also I did not have a regular screw driver I had a drill and I did not have a wrench. Even though the instructions told me I needed this I thought I could get by without it but no you cant. The alignment of things is what also became frustrating at times and wouldnt fit so I would have to take a break and come back to it. However all of the parts were there and did fit but it just wasnt as quickly as most have mentioned.The treadmill itself is awesome I use it every other day. I'm 5'1"" and 180lbs and my son uses it as well he is 5""11 165lbs. I have used it all the way to a speed of 7 and an incline of 10 but mostly speeds of 4-6 with inclines varying and my son have tried at a 10 speed but not a high incline. So it endures and it is steady. It is not that loud.I thought it would fold all the way up but it cant due to the dash board and the cup holders so I just put it up against the wall. However it does fold up and stays up.Overall awesome equipment

  The treadmill is not that great. I broke my treadmill by accidently hitting the stop button in the middle of a run, I then hit the speed button before the belt came to a complete stop and now my treadmill doesn't work. The belt doesn't run but the display's distance readout counts up. The worst part about this is the support for this machine. I tried calling the support number but gave up after being on hold for over an hour, then I tried to use email with support and that took up a week with no results. Support asked for all of my details like name, address, phone, email, machine serial number and I thought we were getting somewhere so I replied within minutes of getting the email. Two days goes by and then they ask for a video of the problem, no worries I sent them a 30-45second video link.  Two days later they tell me the requirements of the video and I have to send it again with 1080 resolution and no longer than 9 seconds long. I send the video again as per their requirements. The next day they email back asking for my name, address, phone number, machine serial number and so. I decided to try calling support again. On hold for 40 minutes, finally talk to somebody and they send me to a the Non-warranty department which is where I am currently stuck on hold while I write this review.I'm about to throw this treadmill out and buy one that doesn't use ICON for their support.The issue with the treadmill:Press start on the display and the belt jerks then stops. Display says the belt is running and increments the distance display. I don't think the treadmill should have let me stop and start the treadmill the way that I did.  The software should have protected the machine from the user (me).

  My wife and I love this treadmill even after having to put it together ourselves. The instructions were easy to follow, just make sure you DO NOT tighten the bolts where stated in the instructions or you'll have problems lining things up later. Thanks to another reviewer we activated it without having to register with ifit and giving them our credit card info. Just hold down the ifit button for 30 seconds then everything works.Took off one star due to the useless AHS assembly that was included in the purchase price. It took 18 days to get an appointment, then no call no show after waiting all day at home for them. I called AHS and after an apology was assured they would get back to us with an appointment date. After another 10 days with no appointment date, we put it together ourselves.AHS states, Handpicked Pros, Upfront Prices, Happiness Guarantee. Hmmm, how does this guarantee work? We're not happy.Anyways........ We do really like this treadmill and all the features it has.

  Ordered this to replace an old, dead treadmill. The first unit arrived damaged in shipping. The replacement process was easier than I expected, but the shipping companies (Pilot and Expo) seemed to not have any idea what they were doing. On the first (damaged) delivery by Pilot, the delivery was late, and when I called she said it wasn't even on the truck. Then, it showed up an hour later. On the replacement, Expo was a bit better but showed up way early, and caused some trouble.HOWEVER, as far as the product, we really like it. A bit of a chore to assemble, as expected, but it went together with no fitment problems. It's very sturdily built. Decent sound capabilities for a treadmill (we use an aux cord from the TV). Buttons respond well when pressed, so speed/incline changes are quick. Two manual settings for flex. We use the softest, feels good. Folds up easily for cleaning underneath, and releases with the press of a foot to float back down.My only complaint is that when you ""stop"" to answer a phone call, hit the bathroom, etc., in the middle of a workout, the timer will reset to zero in about 2 minutes, so if you are meticulous about keeping track of workout times, you need to remember or make note of your time. I find this annoying an completely unnecessary, and  there is no way I can find to fix that (my last treadmill had an option in ""settings"" to allow you to pause indefinitely.)Except for that, I recommend this unit.

  First off,1. Assembly was such a nightmare. Some of the screw placements are in so deep places that you will need a head torch to ensure they are going straight. Some of the screws are in places where it's so difficult to tighten it. I can't believe engineers designed it so poorly. On the flip side, there were not too many parts to put together. Once screw was broken so we ended up putting back a screw which was a throwaway one...2. Let's talk performance - In lower speed, you always feel jerk. In higher speed, it moves so much. It says it has capacity of 300 lbs, but I guess it's actual weight capacity is only 200 lbs.3. I don't know if there's a way you can set weight to get actual calories burn. If there is, then I couldn't find it and it's not intuitive. Again, if it's there...4. Cheap material. I paid $700 for this and I don't even think it's half of it. Even after tightening the screws, the handle is not firm.

Their scam is that when they receive items back in their facility, they don't scan them in upon arrival, and then try to say you didn't send in time, and try to keep your money. I plan on holding them accountable for their fraud. So much wasted time on calls to them to address, with no credit to account as they promised.

  First I am so so impressed with this treadmill. I love everything about it. It is quiet, easy on the joint, inclines nicely, and 1 year of IFit is a sweet deal.The assembly was a bit hard and it takes about 4 hours for one person with the help of another for the steps that requires lifting and adjusting.I had a delivery issue since I live in small city. So it took forever to get a delivery schedule and it was not flexible because the delivery company only comes once a week in our area and they had an issue the first time and  they left me waiting and they did not call or show up.  it was disappointing but I was able to get hold of them next day and reschedule for a week later and this time they were on time. Other than that the machine works great and I am very impressed with it so far. Love iFit and it is worth every penny for me.

  I usually run about 15-20 miles per week and needed a treadmill since going to a public gym isn't an option for me right now. Assembly took a couple of hours but it has held up well during my runs. It bangs a little bit when I hit speeds >6mph and I weigh less than 150lbs so I can see where it might make noise if you run faster or are heavier than that. That being said, I don't have a mat underneath it and that might make a difference. Overall, it's absolutely been worth the cost. (Also, you DO NOT need to activate the trial to start it up! Just hold the bluetooth button down until it starts).

SmEven with the belt issue I still give it 5 stars. The ifit is awesome. It came with a free year and it was very simple to set up. I read in another review it was difficult  but that is not my experience. They send a gift card with a promo code that you enter when setting it up. Also read in a review the treadmill doesn't work without an ifit membership, this is not true. I feel this is a great treadmill for the price. I would definitely buy this treadmill again and will probably only buy nordictrack because of the ifit. It just changes the whole treadmill experience. Love it!!!

  Bought this after comparing quite a few different models.  It's got a few ato workouts programmed into it, and the part which I am enjoying most?  No having to stop every hour.  I usually walk 2 hours after work since I sit and drive all day, and was getting annoyed with the machines at the gym forcing you to cool down and stop every hour.Ifit bypass.  Held the blue ifit button for around 30 seconds, and it unlocks to use.  No submitting the credit card to sign up for anything.Treadmill was easy enough to set up, only had to borrow a second set of hands for assembling the folding mechanism, and the control panel.The control panel has 2 item bins with flat bases which can hold a decent sized water bottle, amongst other things.  There is also a ledge for a cellphone or mp3 player to be placed for music.  Ledge can also hold an e-reader too since I saw that bit on the questions asked.Noise level is pretty equivalent to one at the gym, so it's not excessive and shouldn't bother anyone around.

  This was easy to assemble and it is easy to fold as well. I like that this has pre set programs to use however it is annoying that if you don't purchase the optional package that comes with it you won't have access to everything and it is not cheap to buy the extra package as it is a monthly fee. It will also ask you every time you try to use it to buy the extra package so that's kinda annoying. The updates are long and serve me no use as I don't plan to buy that package as stated. I am also not a fan of the scenery it offers as I was under the impression it would be better quality than what it is. The buttons are easy to use and you can change the speed and incline easily.If I could go back and purchase it again I probably would have bought a cheaper version as the functions I was excited for are what costs extra. Sometimes spending more isn't the smarter route but if you intend to buy the extra monthly fee to use it then you will love it

  I am lucky to have a husband who is very handy and savvy about putting things together.  In reviews we read, someone mentioned putting the treadmill together in half an hour.  I would say that was pretty optimistic.  We spent the better part of the day on assembly.Once the Nordic Track was working, it was squeaking very loudly.  We contacted the service number and received timely help from a representative.  Within a few days we had received a replacement roller and silicon lubricant.  The annoying squeaking has all but disappeared.I use the the treadmill for a walking program and it is perfect for the days when outside weather is inclement (all winter in Idaho).  No excuses for not keeping on track!  I enjoy being able to raise the incline to increase the benefit of the walk.  I use the Nordic Track for an hour and twenty minutes every day to accomplish four miles of walking.As a supplement to the Nordic Track, I joined Prime Unlimited music and have dowloaded my favorites into an awesome workout playlist.  I am very pleased with Amazon Prime Unlimited and recommend it highly.I am also very pleased that I can lift the treadmill into the storage position to open up the space where it sits.  For anyone like me who has to deal with weather problems that keep you indoors, I highly recommend the Nordic Track treadmill.

  Okay, here's the deal. We're in a global pandemic. Our Y opens and shuts according to whatever the County says is prudent at any given moment. My wife decides she wants a treadmill. I order this thing. I assemble the thing. I register the thing. I don't give my credit card info. I still can't use the thing.There is no reason whatsoever that we should be hamstrung by the fact that we can't just plug this stupid thing in and use it. Instead, I'm forced to register (okay, fair enough), asked to shell out $15/month for some bozo to coach me (I know how to walk, thank you very much), and after all is said and done, THE THING DOESN'T WORK.Here's the deal: When I shell out this much money for anything, there's no reason for me to have to think about using it, other than to plug it in, press the program I want, and proceed to use the product. I don't want to think. I just want to use the thing. But now, instead of working out, I'm typing this review. Because, I'm not able to just turn the thing on and use it.I'm sure this will be ""resolved"" within a day or so, and my wife will be happily strolling along.But there shouldn't be an issue like this in the first place. I buy an Apple Computer, and it works out of the box.Buy a NordicTrack, and you have to jump through hoops. Completely unacceptable.NordicTrack: You've gained and lost a customer in one fell swoop.

  Solid quality treadmill at a reasonable price. Setup was easy (no harder than assembling a tricky piece of IKEA furniture. Having two people helps). Itâs been easy to use, has a variety of speeds, speakers arenât bad, heart rate monitor seems accurate, and has overall been a quality treadmill that has been a lifesaver right now.

    Not great for heavy people - belt a little stuttery - but OK
  
",3.0,Christopher Phipps,"Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2021","









  
  
    
  I'm 6'4"", 280lbs. I bought the NordicTrack T 6.5 S treadmill. It says it has a 300-pound user capacity, so I'm pushing the upper end. I tried walking at 2 miles per hour and it didn't feel great, belt had a little stutter. As I went up to 3mph it was smoother. I didn't go above 3mph with me on the belt yet. I felt okay walking at 3mph (slightly fast walk for me). Good enough, for sure. I was surprised by how fast the belt stopped when I pressed ""Stop"". Like, it immediately stopped.The overall feel of the base is fine, but the console is a bit wobbly (just a bit). I suspect it feels more sturdy for anyone under 200lbs. I got the 5 inch screen and the display is super rudimentary, like 1980s sci fi rudimentary.I followed the iFit workaround and just held the iFit button for about 20 seconds and it started. You do NOT need to activate the iFit membership.FYI, I had it professionally assembled (note: I first scheduled through Amazon, those guys never showed, left garbled messages from different phone numbers, super sketchy, so I cancelled and chose a local handyman service). Assembly took almost exactly one hour.Noise: I used a sound meter app on my phone to record noise level. Without me standing on it, phone at hand rail height,: 2mph = 50dBs, 3mph = 60dBs, 8mph = 65dBs. It was never that loud, in my opinion. For context, my microwave was 48dBs and my blender on ice crush mode was 75dBs.

  We really wanted to love this treadmill. It is small enough to fit in many areas. It looks like it will withstand for quite some time and it isnât too noisy when it works properly. However, it started to make a weird sound when we started to use it inclined on the first level and the sound gets worse when you put it down to ground level. Also, the motor hood came broken, we contacted the company several times and received an email asking us about the exact part of the machine that was broken. We replied 5 times and no answer. As you can see in the picture. Very bad customer service and we even bought the extended warranty for it. Really wanted to love this machine since it was affordable and we believed NordicTrack was an amazing company... this is our honest review and hopefully the company listen more to its customers.

  DO NOT BUY THIS ITEM. Terrible treadmill. The heart monitor does not work. When I called customer service, they said the heart monitors are never accurate. Mine is off by 60-70%. I said if it was off 10% I can live with it. The rep told me they are not even that accurate. If the heart monitor does not function well, why does NordicTract  advertise the unit having heart monitor. Everytime I have called NordicTract customer service, I am on hold for at least 30 minutes. Finally they said they will send me a new heart monitor grip. When the package arrived, it was the handle but not the heart monitor grip. I am 5' 11"" and when I incline the treadmill 5%, my hands will not reach the hand grip unless I bend down, not a proper posture for walking. I SUGGEST BUYING ANOTHER BRAND BESIDES NORDICTRACT.

  Been using the this treadmill for about a month and do enjoy it.  We have had no issues with it so far.  Still trying to use the track ""dampeners"" to make your step softer when you step down, but to me it feels about the same when they are in use and not in use.  Gave it four out of five stars due to the display seeming a bit out of date (big blue screen with big square dots for the characters).  Also, the grab handles seem a bit short for us.  You have to stand a bit close to the front of the machine in order to utilize these handles.  If you wish to stand back a bit (so you do not step off the tread and onto the front cover on the machine), the grab handles are a bit in front of you.Assembly was not a problem for me.  It does take about an hour or so to complete and there are a few steps to go through.  There are a couple steps where you will need two people.For the price, the above ""issues"" are minor and would not hesitate to purchase this treadmill.

I will update further once I can actually use the device...Well, I want to be excited about working out, and would like to make this treadmill not become the dreaded close hanging device, but it looks like I am well on my way to that.Day 1, putting the item together and I get to the grounding screw hole, not large enough for the screw they want you to use, but you know what, who cares I will use the original screw they said to replace.  Couple steps later and it has me try to screw the hand rails to the uprights.  The left side worked, but the holes on the right side were not large enough for the bolts to screw in, so here I am, with a treadmill that cannot even be screwed together.  Day 2, what do you know, still no treadmill because I cannot make the hole larger......

  You can lose about 10 lbs just assembling this  machine. Itâs no easy tasks but well worth it once itâs done. The advertising of faraway places you see where the pretty blonde is running on the beach or through cobblestone flower lined streets is BUNK! So far the only areas on the workouts are 3rd world slums.... if you want to see some of the poorest populations on the globe while you run then this has the app for you. As for me itâs depressing. There is also a gimmick to sell you a fitness coach for either 39$ monthly or about 500$ annually. The treadmill itself works fine but youâll be extremely disappointed in the app that takes you to exotic places as you run. Take your own  tablet and tune into some good music and cover the Nordic track screen!

  Absolutely love! Only gave it 3 stars because assembly was a bit difficult but with patience doable, so don't let that scare you. The size isn't huge so it fits well in my space and folds and unfolds very easily.  The wheels also make it easier to move to another location to hide away. It's very smooth to walk on and cushioned for less stress on the knees. I prefer to watch TV during my work out so I dont use the ifit. To get your treadmill going you don't need to subscribe.  Hold the little blue ifit square for a few seconds.  You'll hear it beep and your display will light up. This way you can by pass signing up for ifit. I did register my treadmill.

    Good treadmill but beware the install headaches
  
",4.0,audiophile,"Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I would have given this treadmill 5 stars except the install process was highly frustrating. I am fairly handy so I figured Iâd do the install myself. Itâs certainly easy to do, except for the fact that one little screw that probably cost about 1/10th of a penny arrived broken. Unfortunately it was an essential screw (connected to a ground wire) so I couldnât go without. I looked it up online and it sounds like a fairly common issue. I had to hunt thru my assorted box of loose screws to find something that would fit.  There were other areas of the install where the pre-drilled screw holes werenât big enough and I had to get my drill to loosen up the holes a bit and power the screws in. Trying to do by hand would be next to impossible.  Despite these annoyances, I was able to setup the treadmill by myself in about 3-4 hours.The treadmill itself is high quality. Itâs sturdy, the belt is quietâish, and when in-use, it feels comparable to a commercial gym caliber treadmill.  I was also pleasantly surprised how easy the lift storage feature operated. I was expecting it to be really heavy and cumbersome to lift the base deck up for storage, but with the pneumatic lift arm, it's surprisingly light.The whole iFit thing is misleading and annoying. The trick to hold down the iFit button for 20 sec didnât work at first for me. I had to power off the treadmill and try it again for it to work.Aside from all that, itâs a good sturdy treadmill for an affordable price.

  What a pain to put together! Took 3 hours with two people to get the thing assembled.

Just hold the iFit button for 30s and you can bypass all that junk and get to the good stuff, and by good stuff I mean running (or Iâm my case, walking for a couple hours while playing dungeons and dragons over my tablet I can conveniently set on the treadmill and plug in via Aux for some surround sound).

    Do not buy this treadmill
  
",1.0,Kelly,"Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this treadmill at the end of September and it arrived in early October. After almost exactly 2 months the screen/console does not work. Seriously-- 60 days in and it doesn't work at all? Of course if the console doesn't work that means the treadmill doesn't move so I can't even manually use it.All in all this has been a very painful purchase that I regret. After some issues with the Amazon 3rd party delivery and installation it has worked as expected until last night. After having not used the treadmill for the past week and a half (it was sunny out so I went outside instead) the console does not work. After trying to re-set it per the instructions in the manual it did nothing. After googling other suggestions on how to re-set the console failed I called customer service. They were very nice but oddly enough she immediately said she was submitting for a new console and would expedite shipping. Of course shipping is delayed due to COVID so the piece won't be here for two weeks and then I have to schedule the technician. So for a brand new $2K treadmill the technology broke after 60 days. This now requires a month of downtime (during winter months which was the main reason for the purchase), 30 minutes with customer service and then the actual technician appointment.I am very disappointed given I had a Nordic Track for 15 years before this and never had a single issue. I regret not spending more and going with Pelton.

  There is nothing wrong with the equipment, it works well so far.But I made the mistake of buying a 3 year service plan.

So I wrote a customer service request to please help take care of that. The service representative who responded didn't even read my request, just sent a template mail requesting that I make a video of the problem with the equipment. I responded that there is no problem, just update the database please. I got back another email from him demanding a video of the problem. They don't even read what you write them, just send back template responses wasting their customers' time. I can't imagine how bad it'd be to deal with them if I had an actual problem...

  So, we were looking at treadmills and various other exercise equipment options to get us back on track to getting into shape. Given the non-stop nature of our jobs right now, going to the gym really isn't an option. It was decided to give a treadmill a shot. It is the perfect addition to the home gym I put together. Assembly wasn't to difficult, and I was able to do most of it myself. I would suggest not fully tightening the uprights until after you get the arms and the screen on and adjusted properly. It needs that little bit of flex. Also, unlike all of the warning labels YOU DO NOT NEED AN iFIT MEMBERSHIP. All you have to do is put the emergency stop key in, turn it on, and press and hold the iFIT button on the screen for up to 30 seconds. It will beep and the screen will come up and you are ready to go. The incline is awesome, and the speed controls are right there. Right now we are averaging 30 minutes each a day, and it is a joy to use.

  A handy person with good tools assembled it for me.  He worked non-stop for three hours following the directions and not wasting any time.  I couldn't have done it...too complicated and required too much physical strength.  It had three red signs that said, Stop call if you are having problems rather than to send it back.  Once assembled, it requires connecting to the internet to unlock it.  That makes no sense.  On the positive side, it functions well and is a good size for a home treadmill and while not quiet, it was quieter operating than other home treadmills I have used.

  I tried to wait at least 30 days before reviewing this but I didnt want to forget so here goes. I strongly suggest getting the workout mat for exercise equipment whether you have carpet or not. Or at lease put those foam sliders on the bottom to protect your floor. Assembling this thing wasnt hard but I dont recommend anyone try to do it alone. Also, most electronic equipment recommends that power tools not be used. If you want the machine assembly to be tight, use the power tools but with caution bc that lil tool they include will start to hurt your hand after a while. Once its assembled things run pretty smoothly. The fold up is a great feature, works well. The iFit membership is hit and miss. If you already have workout goals, its not necessary to sign up for it.

  This unit came with a half dozen bonus screws that you're supposed to remove and throw away. That's odd, but not a deal breaker. Or it wasn't until I found that 3 of them were in there so tightly that I couldn't remove them. I can't budge them by hand, with an electric screwdriver, or with a cordless drill. WD-40 makes no difference.The bonus screws are all in critically important connections, so the unit can't be assembled without removing all of them. So if even one is stuck like three of mine are, the unit is useless. I wouldn't gamble with this treadmill.

As a matter of fact, you can control this piece of equipment through iFit.Some part of installation do need two persons, the instruction is reasonably accurate. One suggestion is that, don't tight all nuts until you assemble the screen and so on, or you may need to redo it.The speed is quite accurate when I compare to my Garmin.Folding is very smooth, though I don't really need it. For those living in small apartments, it could be a nice feature.One suggestion is that you may need to pay additional $20 let amazon guys to put it where you want in your house.

  I have been doing the same workout for over 15 years on many different machines at different gyms, etc.  So I have a pretty good idea of treadmill speed.  My new T 6.5 s felt like it was going too fast and I was having a hard time keeping up.  Most Nordictracks had an ""Advanced Calibration"" mode to determine speed calibration, but no longer with the new models.  So I determined how many rotations per minute a properly calibrated machine would have at 5 and 10 mph (47.14 rotations at 5mph, and 94.29 rotations at 10mph).  Sure enough my brand new T 6.5 s was running more than 0.2 mph faster than the readout.  It's possible to adjust the belt speed (search YouTube), so it's fixed now.  But otherwise I'm not impressed with the apparent lack of QC out of the factory (or elimination of the Advanced Calibration mode).  A proper belt speed is important.  Otherwise, decent machine.

  The treadmill looks nice, feels solid, as much of the support is constructed of steel.

The parts arenât always consistently labeled in the text and diagrams, some of the bolts are extremely difficult to attach unless you lift each side of treadmill, and other screws need to be removed in order for some bolts to go in, but thatâs not mentioned until two steps later - when you should already have put those bolts in! And even though the assembly process doesnât mention adding the safety key to the console, it wonât work unless that key is in place!

Plan to have a delivery service take it upstairs (if that's your plan).  Assembly is not terribly difficult, depending on how handy you are.  Took us about 3 hours with a proper tool set.If you are not handy, I would pay for delivery and assembly.Unit is surprisingly large (a good thing) and very sturdy.NordicTrack's ""activation"" is ridiculously complex.  Instructions are not good.  You have to activate through ""iFit"".. but we are not planning to use iFit.  You have to connect to a mobile device to ""activate"" the treadmill (which is probably just a ploy to get you enrolled in iFit, even if you don't plan to use it).After ""activating"" (which the instructions don't adequately explain"", your mobile device is connected (via Bluetooth) and the treadmill won't work independently until you disconnect from your mobile device.Once we figured that out (which was VERY frustrating for about an hour or so), the treadmill works perfectly as a basic, on/off, faster/slower, increase grade/decrease grade treadmill.

    Decent treadmill for the money
  
",4.0,Dan Marvin,"Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2021","









  
  
    
  I ordered this treadmill because of the weight capacity (donât judge, youâre looking at treadmills too) and name brand for the price.  Originally I was worried that we would be locked into an iFit membership but holding down the iFit button for 30 seconds unlocked it and weâve been able to use it with no issues. This wouldnât be my first choice for an iFit treadmill unless youâre planning to use your own screen anyway. The assembly wasnât bad, I feared it would be worse based on other reviews Iâve read. All of the parts feel substantial and it certainly weighs enough that it shouldnât fall apart easily. My wife has used it several times and I tried it last night for the first time. Although it would benefit from a fan, I found a pedestal fan for $30 that works well enough. Itâs fine for home use.

  My wife and I purchased the NordicTrack T Series Treadmill to get a little exercise at home given the COVID pandemic. The delivery through Amazon worked great. I set up a time and two delivery guys dropped off the package. Assembly took a little longer than expected (about 90 minutes) but I will note that I have never assembled one before so I had nothing to really base my expectations on. I am now at the 3 month mark of using the treadmill. The speed and incline functions have worked well. The unit is also pretty quiet which is nice since me and my wife are both working at home. There is nothing more that I really need in a treadmill. I would purchase again.

    Quick and easy to put together and set up
  
",5.0,Kristin,"Reviewed in the United States September 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  Product was really easy to put together.  Instructions call for 2 people to put together but it is doable with just 1 person (but much more difficult and time consuming especially attaching the console and the drop bar underneath; it is also VERY heavy all together). Once it is all assembled,  you do need to activate it online at ifit.com and create an account before you can start using it. However, unlike some other reviews I've read, you do NOT have to provide a credit card in order to use it. It does have a spot to enter your credit card as you are setting up the account but right next to ""credit card"" it specifically says that entering that is OPTIONAL. I simply skipped that part and finished registering without it. Once my account was created,  I was able to sync my treadmill with the app via Bluetooth and was then able to start using it. As some reviewers have commented,  the belt is slightly noisy as you walk on it, however,  I wear headphones on the treadmill so that is not an issue for me at all (I also only walk on the treadmill, not run, so it may be more/less noisy at higher speeds).

  I have had this treadmill for two years and I adore it.  I assembled it myself - fold it and roll it away with ease and enjoy all the ifit features.  I highly recommend it.  The negative reviews that I have seen seem to be about the person who came to assemble the unit for people, and customer service - I personally cannot relate.I also have had 5 back surgeries, 2 foot, one knee, three hand...so working out and staying fit is important to me and this treadmill has been a great option for me.  I have to be careful about high impact workouts but the suspension of this treadmill has been great as long as I build up my workouts and listen to my body.I really enjoy it and the iFit features.Oh - and there is an emergency stop feature for those who are worried about a few negative reviews - so if you follow all the user suggestions you'll be safe and sound.

  It's a great machine and the ensemble was fairly easy. The only process I found unlikable was the IFIT that's incorporated with it. Before you can use the treadmill they try to get you to subscribe to IFIT. It is not needed. Seems like a little trickery on NordicTrack and IFIT.

  I just got this treadmill and love it already! This treadmill is pretty solid. I was worried that it might be wobbly but it felt totally balanced. It folds up nicely too. It's definitely not commercial grade but it's the next best thing, especially for the price. It took my husband and a friend about 45 minutes to put it together.Amazon does NOT make it easy to activate your free 1 year membership and still have not gotten that figured out yet. Also, you do NOT need to get ifit to activate. Just hold the ifit bluetooth button for about 10 seconds and that unlocks your tread.

  The cons are, the frame is poorly made, a bolt on each side of the arms did not thread at all. Luckily there is 4 bolts and 3 of them hold well on each side. Not impressed about parts not threading. Also, they place screws into parts that need to be removed before putting it together. This was an issue as one of the screws was so locked inside that even a power tool wouldnt remove it. I had to use wd40 along with different pliers to remove it. Took 3 hours to put together start to finish.The pros, it works really well, I had no issue with the motor, no skips, and i ran for an hour straight. I read reviews PRIOR to purchasing, and I was able to avoid the iFit sign up nonsense by holding the ifit button for a few seconds in order to turn on the machine . I will say though, they had about 4 warning labels to sign up or you cant turn it on, however I ignored them all and held the button to avoid it and had no issue. The motor worked great, the elevation worked perfect as well as speeding up and slowing down. As long as the arms hold, I dont care that 1 bolt isnt seating correctly, however it's pretty sad that this expensive machine isnt built correctly. Pretty sad coming from a name brand like Nortic, so I wont be giving a great review. Not impressed.

  We got our treadmill and prior to purchasing it were skeptical about the 55â length of T6.5si - I can tell you that it is not an issue at all. I am 5â10â and donât ever feel like I will go off the back edge while running or walking. The treadmill is very sturdy, comfortable to run on, and we love the iFit. It makes a treadmill fun and keeps workouts fresh each and every time that we get on it for a run or a trail hike. The iFit trainers on screen are informative and offer tips while the workout plays on screen.We really enjoy the treadmill automatically making incline and speed changes to match the on screen workout  as you go along. This treadmill makes the old, boring, mundane workouts fun as time passes quickly with the interactive on screen trainer guiding you through the workouts.I did a lot of research, and if you want a solid treadmill with some nice technology features you canât go wrong with this one. It doesnât have a 21â Peloton screen, but in my opinion the 10â screen is plenty big for what you need to follow along with the trainers.

    Budget friendly and great treadmill
  
",5.0,Sinok P.,"Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  I did research many treadmills and ended up purchasing this one among others.Here are reasons:- Width and length are wider and longer than others (within my budget)- Auto incline feature- I did not want any fitness subscription service- Foldable treadmill- At least speed up to 10 and more AND more incline feature than other treadmillsI am an avid runner and run outside most of the time. Living in Seattle area, during winter season, it is hard to run outside during rainy days, so I decided to purchase a treadmill. Some people commented this treadmill is for entry level or mid-level runners or walkers. It really depends on what people need.I normally set the speed for 9 or 10 and incline level from 5 to 10 (alternate) during my running for 30 mins to an hour. That is more than good enough exercise for me. This treadmill responses quickly when I want to incline and speed up. Number blinks until the desire set incline level or / and speed level is met which is a nice feature to let me know.iFit, I got the help from many people's comment (pushing iFit button for 30 second to bypass).One thing, I've noticed is the inaccurate number for calories that I burn during running or walking. It is quite off from my smart watch. Probably, it is a mix of unable to factor into my weight, height and age plus more.Also some people mentioned about the treadmill's noise level. I don't think it is noisy.Putting this treadmill into a room or even in a garage, yes it does make some noise comparing to treadmills in a spacious healthclub. It is rather a room size making sound louder in my opinon. My health club treadmills might be equally noisier if you put one in a small room (knowing health culb treadmills are being used many hours per day and nearly 7 days a week).Assembling this treadmill will take a while (about 2 to 3 hours depending on your skill). It is a heavy equipment.Here are tips.Unless you place the treadmill box on the exact spot where you want to work out (even then you will have to take it out and assemble), you will have to move it after taking it out from the box and assembling it.Assembling a folding up rod first will help you because now you can fold up the treadmill and moving the treadmill with pre-attached two rollers on the bottom of the frame (I was able to roll the treadmill to the location where I want it to be without lifting it up). This method does not work if your treadmill is deliver to one area and you will have to move it to a different floor.I purchased a cheap bluetooth receiver (which connected to my treadmills aux). Now my treadmill is a bluetooth enabled device. Listening sound from the treadmill's speakers is better than from my phone.One thing that I commonly saw from the reviews (not limited to Amazon), there might be some broken pieces during shipping and handling (or even during packing). Mine also came with a broken cup holder screw housing which I had to modify (it was so minor and I did not want to call either Amazon or NordicTrack).In short, this treadmill is for anyone unless you compete for professional level of running, noise level is similar to my health club commercial ones, and assembly is not hard but time consuming with a well-written instruction.

  We ordered this treadmill at the beginning of the Covid shut down and Iâm so glad we did. Assembly took the better part of an afternoon, though it was not difficult. We followed the steps carefully and found the instructions easy to follow.After several months of near daily use by myself and my husband (who is 6â4) it shows no signs on wear and still performs like new. It is smooth and doesnât jerk like some other treadmills. Folding the running platform up and down is super easy, too.The only thing to note, and this isnât really a bad thing, is that once you pair your phone with it, it automatically pairs when the machine turns on. This is obviously a great feature for convenience. However, if two people are going to use it, be aware that if the other personâs phone is paired and the paired phone is out of range, it will beep loudly until it is unpaired. Now when my husband wants to use it, I have to unpair my phone. Itâs not a big deal at all, just something to be aware of.

If it had ACTUALLY made me subscribe just to make it run, I would have returned it. But, some clever person on a review found out that if you just hold the ifit button for 20 seconds on the consol, it skips over the activation nonsense.  If the app-schmozzle from Iowa teaches us anything it is that machines and systems do not need to be connected to apps to work or work better.

  It took me about 6 hours to take the treadmill out of the shipping carton, read the assembly  instructions, and put it together.  It requires a 14mm socket wrench, an 14mm box wrench, a number 2 Phillips screwdriver, and an included hex wrench.  The provided hex wrench was inadequate given the number of bolts requiring it.Then once it was together, one of the wiring connectors hadn't seated properly and the inclination controls didn't work.  After speaking with their customer service department, I disassembled the control panel again, reseated all of the wiring connectors, and then everything worked properly.If I were to repeat this, I would make certain I had a hex head socket so that I could use a ratchet to install the bolts.  Just that simple tool might have saved one hour.Once it was assembled and working it proved to be a very nice product.  We use it daily. It is quiet and works well in our home.

  Ok, well... My wife took like 3-4 hours to put together and it was driving us crazy. That's mainly because the manual doesn't mention anything about the use of tools. And, the installation video we saw on YouTube recommended hand tightening the screws. Do NOT attempt this. Having a Socket wrench or power tools will make the installation much easier.Some people mentioned something about not being able to log on without activating the iFit free trial. That is true. It is not true that if you hold down the iFit button for 30 seconds that it will bypass this. It asks for a CC for autobilling afterwards, but that's optional.The treadmill seems to be working fine. It has a wide belt and feels sturdy, doesn't shake at all. I had to request a replacement part for the rod that lets you fold up the treadmill. It's been a bit of a nightmare putting this thing together in entirety, but hopefully it's worth it, because it feels like a good quality machine otherwise.

  Keeping in mind that this is not a ""pro"" level or gym-caliber model, this unit has no trouble keeping up in terms of speed.  Incline motor has some difficulty keeping up with some of the workout programs and requires some manual re-setting to work.  The quality of the programming on ifit is superb, and it comes as a great surprise given the affordability!  The training is top notch and covers all types of fitness, combining weight training with treadmill exercises and an excellent logging system.  Live workouts are excellent and allow interaction with the trainers.  The programming is so effective you will find yourself staying on the treadmill for double or triple the time you would normally exercise.  Unlike trendy workouts and fitness trends in the ""Insanity"" or the ""Crossfit"" mindset, trainers push you hard but also utlize ample rest and recovery techniques.  This results in greater long-term improvement and prevents injury.

  I've had my treadmill since the end of March without any issues.  It was a COVID quarantine purchase and I use it almost daily.  Assembly was not difficult, but I did require my wife's assistance at the end to install the rods so the treadmill can fold up.  I ended up purchasing another NT studio cycle that came with a year of iFit, so I use my treadmill with the iFit program too.  The T 6.5 S does not have a built in tablet, so I connect my iPad via bluetooth and screen mirror to a TV.  Although, I did not think I would enjoy the automated  resistance and speed changes with the iFit programming, I have found those features enhance my workouts.  The treadmill is very responsive to the automated changes.  The treadmill is quiet and folds easily for space saving capabilities as well.  The incline (10%) and speed (10mph) are adequate for me, but I know my wife would prefer a higher incline for the iFit hiking programs.  Overall, I am more than satisfied with my purchase, and will likely purchase more equipment from NT in the future!

",1.0,Rajasekar Sekaran,"Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2021","









  
  
    
  After using it for around 1 year(before my warranty expired) I had problem with my treadmill belt, console and side bars. I contacted the customer support. They took the photos of the damages. They put me on hold and checked with the support technicians and informed me that they would be sending me the treadmill walking mat alone. The rusted side bars and the console won't be replaced. They claimed it is because of misuse(like placing the treadmill in open or water). Also when I asked about a technician to be sent for the treadmill walking mat, they informed that they cannot send a technician because of the ""gross"" condition of the treadmill and I have to pay for the technician.I could not understand what would one expect the condition of the treadmill when it is used for an year. I doubt the quality of the components used in the product, it could not withstand the usage not even 1 year. But the support claims that the equipment used for 10 years is still in a good condition.I am totally dissatisfied with the quality of the product and the support.

  Â Just assembled mine and used very little and incline suddenly stopped working. Amazon answered same day, manufacturer no.Some considerations:Delivery- Good package condition, Amazon was on time.Assembly- One of the reasons for one star is the incline and,the guide is ok but it comes with a flaw on the ground screw (Step 3) and it seems a factory problem since saw a lot of comments on this. The screw is malformed (First Pic) and it's impossible to attach it. I'll need to contact Norditrack to see if I can have a new screw.- Really needs two persons to assembly it.Functions- Seems very wide and good to run/walk- The autoincline is really good if worked, worked at first them suddenly stoppedCons- Yes you can bypass Ifit attaching the key and then pressing 30 seconds (I've searched for this before buy) but is really bad to see a company trying to force you on this- Doesn't have controls in the arm bars. This isn't a must but for the price shouldn't be a problem to include itWill update this if the manufacturer answer*****UPDATE***** 12/12/2020I was able to make the incline work by myself, I've applied WD in the autoincline screws and it seems that was jammed. But it still have a problem, when it's descending make a very hard noise and seems miss some steps (Video). This is worse if there's someone in the treadmill, right now as is I can't use this since can broke something and it's dangerous.Icon contacted me but after I've managed to make it work, now I'm waiting their answer on this new problem, very frustrating.

  I owned a Schwinn 820 P treadmill for the last 15 years, but it got old and kind of wore out. So I decide to purchase a new treadmill and decided on the NordicTrack NTL17915T 6.5 S, as soon as the treadmill was set up I tried it out and itâs a beautiful piece of equipment. I feel Iâll get my moneys worth out of it many times more than what I paid for it. Beautiful piece of equipment. The delivery of the treadmill was fantastic, it was delivered exactly the hour they said it would be and delivered right to my front door wonderful job Amazon, and the  technician came out two days later exactly on time very wonderful person and put my treadmill together like a pro. I couldâve done it myself but having him do it was well worth the money. Very nice guy, Amazon your company is getting better every day and thank you. FReDðð

    Activation is not what it seems
  
",2.0,Mark A Duncan,"Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2021","









  
  
    
  It took me 1 hour to unlock this machine!  (Kind of felt like a scam...)  Assembly instruction graphics are difficult to make out/see unless you have perfect vision.This machine that I already paid several hundred dollars for, can only be activated by not going to NordicTrack's website, but instead to ifit.com which requires you to sign up for their $15/mo membership.  What the heck?  OK, yes there is a 30 day free trial but you still want my credit card and remember to cancel it after a month.  It all feels shady.  Seriously - tell me its an option not a requirement to just use what I already paid for.  NordicTrack should be the one to unlock my machine as part of the warranty registration process.  Let me use it first before you start asking for MORE MONEY.  I was so annoyed after putting it together, that all I wanted to do was run off some steam.  It took me 1 hour to get this machine to start working!  Two different phone numbers, both of which are ifit, and all recordings insist you MUST register with iFit.com before anyone can talk to you.  Finally I pressed the correct button combo that told me to hold down on a ""bluetooth"" button until it turned green and it would unlock.  First off the button was NOT the Bluetooth icon or even that name;  it was the iFit button.  Oh and I tried that several times, and once it turned green, I let go just as the recorded message instructed.  Nope that didn't do it either.  Holding the button down for almost a minute did the trick (surprise!) and I was able to use the treadmill.  So easy and simple once you figure that out ON YOUR OWN.

  For itâs price, itâs really great! I have it on my 2nd floor on my house, and the noise and shaking is very minimal. It runs pretty smooth, I typically do 7-8 mph for 30 minutes and havenât run into many problems. Itâs very easy to change speeds, has strong supports, and a great display. You can even open a browser and use it like any other device when connected to internet!

  We love this treadmill. My husband and I have had this for close to 2 months now. I researched different brands, models, sizes, and technologies and this one is really blowing us out of the water. The deck itself is very sturdy. We have also been very impressed with the options coming from iFit across different programs. The only wish we have is that the screen was a little more mobile, it only has the ability to shift up and down a small amount, but not a huge issue. If you have been overwhelmed with all of the options out there, just give this one a shot. It isn't a commercial grade treadmill, but it has all the little bells and whistles that make you feel like you are on one.

    Basic treadmill that gets the job done. Terribly designed for assembly!
  
",3.0,Saqib Sheikh,"Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is a very basic treadmill that will get to a steep incline, and speed up to a pace that gets you to a moderate job. I and my wife are of average height and it's good enough for us. It is not for people are in good shape and want to do HIIT trainings, or want to get to sprints.Also, I have to say this is a terribly designed product for assembly. When delivered it has four basic parts:- running base- console- two (sturdy) metal legs to connect the base to the console...this should not require 2+ hours to assemble. However the treadmill is plagued with bad design which makes assembly a real pain. I assembled it, it wouldn't turn on and I had to partially disassemble to fix a disconnected power supply cable. Joining the base to the console requires used 3 different screws & washers for the same joining part with the metal legs, and the holes are in the most awkward places - all of which makes the assembly process unnecessarily frustrating and could have been avoided if designers had taken more care.ALSO, AS OTHERS HAVE POINTED OUT - YOU DO NOT NEED iFIT ACTIVATION TO USE THE TREADMILL. IT'S ALL FALSE ADVERTISING TO FORCE YOU INTO A TRIAL iFIT SUBSCRIPTION. TERRIBLE CUSTOMER CENTRIC DESIGN. PLEASE STOP NORDICTRACK....God help me if I have to call in for support.

  Estoy muy contento con esta nueva adquisiciÃ³n para mi entrenamiento personal en casa. Es bastante cÃ³moda y silenciosa al Momento de hacer los ejercicios. Me encanta el sistema iFit cardi q viene incluido con la Maquina porque tienen diferentes rutinas de ejercicio que te ayudan a ejercitarte de mÃºltiples maneras. Actualmente estoy disfrutando del mes gratis de este programa y comienzo a pagarlo a partir del segundo mes, por lo que estoy aprovechandolo al mÃ¡ximo para decidir en ese perÃ­odo de prueba si realmente quiero quedarme con esta aplicaciÃ³n, lo cual si me gustarÃ­a porque es realmente impresionante. Al momento en que llegÃ³ el tÃ©cnico a hacer la instalaciÃ³n de la mÃ¡quina en mi casa, luego de desempacar el producto de la caja pudimos notar que la tapa que va encima del motor estaba daÃ±ada, pero esto pudo haber sucedido en el momento del envÃ­o, inmediatamente tome foto de esa parte e hice el reclamo directamente a la fabrica y ellos atendieron de inmediato mi reclamo y en tan solo dos dias me dieron respuesta de que ya la pieza habÃ­a sido enviada a mi domicilio. Por lo que me da una gran satisfacciÃ³n de poder contar con la garantÃ­a del producto de manera exitosa con esa gran atenciÃ³n al cliente de parte del personal profesional de Nordic Track. Me gusta la forma automÃ¡tica de inclinaciÃ³n que tiene, al momento de hacer los ejercicios si el programa escogido en la app tiene subidas y bajadas, asÃ­ como incremento o disminuciÃ³n en la velocidad, todo se hace de forma automÃ¡tica. Puedo medir mi ritmo cardÃ­aco colocando mis manos en la barra. Pude ubicarla sin problema en mi sala de estudio de frente al TV. Recomiendo este producto con la mayor satisfacciÃ³n que tengo por haberlo adquirido.

  I bought this treadmill eleven months ago and have experienced nonstop issues with it. The belt came out of the box uncentered which a professional had to fix after it caused a tear within two months. Then a few months later, the belt folded over while I was using it. I contacted customer support since it's under warranty for twelve months. Well, they outsource that to a third party and they're very hard to get a hold of (I wonder why). After a month of not being able to use it, I got the new belt installed and it still has issues. I know this is a ""cheaper"" treadmill relative to the multi-thousand dollar ones out there, but for $500+, it should be a serviceable product. This is not. Avoid Nordic altogether.

  It took a little while (almost 3 hours) to get it set up but it was worth the effort. The feature I like most about it is; I can see the trainers walking ahead of me and if they go too fast, I can adjust the speed to my convenience. What I also like is the volume, I can turn the sound off or on. While off, I can watch TV without getting distracted. The areas which the trainers show around the world are very exciting and interesting to view. They show me places where I have never been but would like to visit. The free IFIT membership does wonders for me because they have training programs that suit every need, even live. Especially for me to lose weight while walking, jogging or running which is much healthier than going outside to do the same.

    Great near-commercial home unit
  
",5.0,B. Piazza,"Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2019","









  
  
    
  Writing this 90 days after having this unitâ  There are so many units to choose today all with plenty of features and capabilities.  To put this review in context, I have a gym membership and go four times a week and use their commercial equipment .  By far I am not a health nut or exercise fanatic .  I mostly go to stay in basic shape.  What I realized is I was spending the majority my time at the gym (and driving back and forth) just to hit the treadmill and bicycles for cardio.  So I opted to purchase this unit and a Schwinn cardio bike for home, both for less than $800.Happy with my choice, saves me time in the morning, kids use it, can just hop on it anytime.  That said if youâre looking for a solid treadmill that does most everything you need that feels very close to the weight and stature of a gym model this unit has really impressed me.  Itâs heavy duty, belt is lighter than a gym model but still solid, cushions are just right for aggressive runs, deck it a good thickness (I weigh 195lbs) and it feels much like a commercial unit without the $2k and north price.  I would suggest that you not overspend and buy a unit tauting a bunch of bells and whistleâs that you ultimately will not use.  The T6.5S has all of the core features every treadmill offers.  It has iFit, donât use it, and solid program options to vary the work out.  What it lacks is a lot of hi-tech features that I personally think are what most of us really donât use because we have better alternatives at home.  Example is Bluetooth.  No BT on this unit.  It has an 1/8th jack and speakers in the console.  To be honest no treadmill can out perform my little $150 Bose Sounddock mobile speaker or BT headphones connected to my phone.  So why pay for subpar audio equipment.  No cooling fan.  I use a far more functional Vornado fan when it gets warm that circulates air throughout the room.  I would have liked to have it Polar compatible so my pulse chest strap would feed the console.  I have to wear the watch.  Btw, the console is great, simple, easy to read and has several modes and rotations to monitor different aspects of your run.  Ok, so no complaints on this unit at all and I am pleased that it was extremely inexpensive.  Highly recommend for a near-commercial home unit.

  We had a very very old sears treadmill that didn't have any bells and whistles. We wanted something with programs and ability to incline - I love that it does this automatically. I went with this unit after doing a lot of research on different models and ultimately the warranty and brand name had something to do with our decision.The unit arrived by carrier and we paid for the extra so they would put it in our basement. Delivery service was very nice and professional. The unit arrived well packed and in great condition. It took about 2 hours to put together. Having a second person helped a lot - especially when attaching the bar to support for folding. I would suggest having a socket wrench to make the installation of bolts quicker and easier. I loved how the screws, bolts, washers and nuts came on a card with the step numbers, so when your looking in the manual to put together you look at what step your on (say step 4) and you look at the card for step 4 and there are the screws or bolts you need. I think we will be very pleased.

  My husband and I gifted this to each other for our New Years resolution of getting healthy. I am in love with it. I searched high and low and did so much research to end up back here. It is affordable and does not feel cheap at all. Assembly takes 2 people no doubt about that. It is heavy so having the delivery people place it in the home and assemble is probably the best bet if you dont have any extra hands. I read all the negative reviews about iFit. First of all you can bypass it by holding the button down for 30 seconds. Second of all I would not use this without my iFit app. I LOVE IT! I do not work out I hate running so having an app that can control my workout keeps me motivated. Plus on days I dont want to run or climb I can do yoga or weight training with it. Itâs $15/month. Cheaper than the gym member ship I wasted for 2 years and never went. The box was damaged upon delivery however the product inside was not. If youâre actually serious about using it, this is an amazing option. If not youâll have an expensive place to hang your laundry.

  This treadmill is great. Folds easily and it has a slow release when you let it down. Really like that. The belt is wide enough you donât feel closed in and it is a smooth ride. The incline is amazing and the speed seems to be right on track to what I was doing outside. I love it!As for the iFit subscription. You do get a 30 free trial. But all you have to do is hold down the iFit button until it beeps and your on manual with 20 preset workouts or you can manually go from there as you prefer.Donât hesitate. Buy it!

  Fairly easy to assemble. Onboard workouts donât function the way I was expecting. If youâre planning on signing up for iFit I would not recommend this machine. First of all, it is really not accessible on the machine as you have to use either your phone or iPad to select your workouts and then download them to the machine. I couldnât get this process to complete even after being on the phone with iFit for over 2 hours. I have had machines with iFit before and an iFit membership so I know what it is and what I expected from this machine. I wish I had waited and got a better treadmill from Costco for the same price that DID have iFit actually on it as well as a free full year of iFit membership, which became available after I already had this one. The treadmill is more basic but works for just getting my daily steps in during this pandemic, just disappointing.

Yay! My husband and I put it together in about an hour. It went together pretty smoothly and then I adjusted the track to center before getting on it. It works great! Like other reviews, I bypassed the iFit by pressing the iFit button for 10 seconds. The 20 programs are more than enough for me. I am able to plug in my iPad to the accessory cable and watch whatever tv show or listen to whatever podcast I want through the treadmill stereo which is great! Overall, Iâm very happy and will continue to love the USA made Nordictrack!

  Quality is fine, nothing fabulous but good for home use. A little noisy but nothing that isn't easily drowned out by headphones or a tv with the volume slightly turned up. My biggest issue was with the instructions. There were definitely a few steps missing but with a little common sense you can figure it out. However the one step that's missing something that could result in a bigger issue is around the hydraulic stand. There's a small metal piece holding the hydraulic pole down in place and if you remove it at the wrong time you can't install the pole, which is what happened to me. The treadmill still runs fine but i'm not able to fold it which really sucks because it takes up half of my workout room. Also just to echo what most other reviews say you don't have to sign up for iFit to use it, that's just an illegal marketing tactic that Amazon should honestly make the company remove.

  For those of you who get to step 8 (putting the cross bar on) and think huh?  yes the bar does fit and screws DO fit but you do need a power tool to get them in, even though the instructions tell you not to use one.  The cross bar also looks as though it fits awkwardly, but it all comes together once screwed in. After that, its plain sailing ---but it is for sure a two person job.  And yes, if you press and hold the button it will turn on without ""activation"", but you do need the red magnet on first.i havent used it much yet so I will update if something goes wrong! overall seems very sturdy and not noisy.Bottom line---if you generally hate assembling things or are not a ""handy"" person, this one is tricky, so pay to have it done.

  Great quality treadmill once you get it up and running, but thatâs the rub. Assembly is difficult with bolts in difficult to reach places and takes quite a bit of fiddling to line up bolts with thread holes.  And donât even talk to me about activating the treadmill.  The website is very user unfriendly and you canât talk to an actual person until you register online which is constantly interrupted by solicitations for protection plans.  The final insult is after you get through all the registration stuff you are told to âpress the Bluetooth button until a green light comes on â. They donât mention that you have to hold until the screen changes to the treadmill menu.  Prefer the old days when you just plugged the treadmill in and worked out !

  I've used this treadmill almost every day for 6 months.  It's a decent machine, but very basic.  The set up was not easy, but no treadmill set up is easy; it was on par with other treadmill assembly procedures.  I didn't want the ifit so I bypassed that by putting the key on and then pushing the ifit button and holding until it disabled it.This treadmill works fine for how I use it; which is to get on manual mode and walk with incline for 30 minutes.  I wish it had a better ""calories burned"" calculator (it doesn't ask for body weight, so it's not accurate).  I also wish that the incline went higher than 10.  Also there is no fan on this model, which I didn't think I would mind, but occasionally I wish it was there.  All in all, its a fine treadmill, but I do wish I had spent another 100 to get the features I am missing.

That sometimes takes multiple touches of the 'convenient' touch screen. THEN you have to cancel the warm up. It is only after ALL THIS HASSLE that you can select a speed and incline. I WOULD THINK VERY CAREFULLY before purchasing this treadmill because of this. It's very inconvenient.This treadmill is a really great piece of equipment- heavy duty and works great. However, think long and hard about where you will place it in your home. I expected Amazon to provide inside delivery and assembly, but because of COVID-19, they did not provide that service. AND Amazon didnt tell me this-- it was the delivery driver. To say I was disappointed and a bit irritated, is an understatement.I planned to install this upstairs in my home and the deck (or base if you will) to this treadmill is extremely heavy (as you might expect). It took two of us to haul it up the stairs and that was just the beginning. The design is good, but assembly is not easy for one person. Some of the crevices that you have to get a socket wrench into are pretty small and the control panel is very tricky for one person to install. In retrospect, you really need a two person team to put this together. Unfortunately, I was on my own.The iFit guided workouts are pretty much overly talkative people on videos-- really not worth the money or time. You'll need a 20 amp dedicated circuit with this beast or you will trip the breaker.

  We purchased our NordicTrack T Series 6.5Si Treadmill to stay healthy during COVID-19.  It was the best decision we could have made.  I love the iFit membership and all the programs it has for the treadmill.  Since I cannot travel to other countries right now I use the programs to visit many different locations.  The treadmill follows the program in speed and incline % and is a great work out.  The only issue I had was that the belt kept shifting to the right past the guide markers.  After contacting NordicTrack support and following their instruction the adjustment was made and all is good.I would recommend this treadmill hands down.

  The NordicTrack T Series Treadmill is a high quality treadmill, reasonably priced, and the delivery was coordinated very well with Amazon's delivery subcontractor. It is a challenge to assemble, but the directions and easy to follow. My wife and daughter use the treadmill a fair amount, and expect when winter of 2020 sets in, the usage will increase.

    Economical Treadmill for a Well-known Brand
  
",4.0,VMI 1981 Grad,"Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  I can't quite give this treadmill a 5 Star Rating simply because it represents a basic design element that seems to be typical of most, if not all NordicTrack treadmills.  The front edge of the tread is far too close to the edge of the frame platform structure, such that it is virtually impossible to hold the bar to check the heart-rate without kicking or stepping onto the frame platform forward of the actual moving tread while walking in a normal upright manner.  Other brands have designed the tread to travel at least 6 additional inches forward of the bar so that it does not require one to lean forward in an unnatural position to reach the bar.  It has taken a while to adjust to this awkward stance, so I check my heart-rate less frequently.  Otherwise, this model has a smooth tread-run and supports a comfortable impact.  Since I purchased this model as heavily discounted on Cyber Monday 2018, I feel it is still not a bad buy.

  When you get the treadmill all put together and go to use it for the first time ,the screen lights up and it makes you input a credit card or it will not work they will tell you to ACTIVATE THE MONTHLY WORKOUT SCAM FOR 15 OR $30 A MONTH and you MUST DO THIS TO USE THE TREDMILL  ..ITS B.S  if you turn on the treadmill and hold down the little square fit button for 30 seconds it will bypass the monthly activation charge and you can run without the monthly bill. Why they don't tell you this as well but NOWHERE in the instructions or the screen promPs do the say you can bypass this monthly scam function. But besides that lil preditory scam the unit Worked for about 2 weeks , then it started making a ( humming or loud buzzing straining noise) from the motor then eventually started to get slower to the point it won't turn or move the belt. Now after 2 week when you turn it on to jog it won't move the belt at all ,the motor it just buzzes and humms. I ASSUMED I was getting a deal with the decent price and the company name plate . Also if you run at your gym there will be a big difference between 6 on that gym machine compaired to 6 on this machine. This Tredmill seems to be off a bit with the speed , how hard is it to get the speed right ? 8 mph is 8 mph no matter what state your in. This machine is off compaired to other machines...

  We bought a Nordic Track because of their quality reputation. We had major issues during assembly. At least a half dozen screw holes were not drilled to the proper size. We either had to get our own screws or force the provided screws in. What should have taken 30 minutes took 3 hours. Then once its setup you are forced to sign up for iFit. You get a 30 day free trial but are required to provide credit card info and cancel later. YOUR TREADMILL WILL NOT TURN ON UNTIL YOU SIGN UP FOR IFIT. The treadmill itself runs well but we are very disappointed in Nordic Track.

  I love how easy it is to use the simple features such as the speed and incline. I'm a little confused how to use all the buttons on the center of the console, but I'm content with navigating the simpler features of the machine. This takes two people to set it up. Do not do this on your own unless you are a very strong person, it is an incredibly heavy unit and needs to be kept in a certain orientation when you move it to wherever you want it. It also requires careful reading of instructions, a few of your own tools, and about 5 hours to assemble, but it's not impossible to figure out and I have assembled much more frustrating things in my life, and it definitely was nowhere near that. Getting the iFit to sync with the treadmill WAS frustrating. It was not straight forward and took several attempts. After 5 hours of assembly I was so excited to turn this thing on aaaand I couldn't for another 3 hours trying to get the dang iFit to sync. I almost gave up at about 11pm, my partner was miffed, I was disappointed, and if you don't get iFit for at least a try (which is a separate purchase and not cheap), your machine is locked and will not turn on, which was not clear when I made my purchase but luckily I decided I wanted to try it when I purchased it... other people may have found this a particularly unpleasant surprise. I mostly blame the seller for not making this detail clear about this unit. Just please, please for your own sanity and time, do your homework before you get it on your front door step. You'll have plenty of time, it took almost 2 months to get here. That was the other frustration, when I checked out, I was asked to schedule a time for it to get here. I said some day in June. When I went back to my orders, it said it was delayed a whole extra month. You do have the option with Amazon to cancel an order before it is delivered if you don't want to wait that long, but there really is nothing they can do to speed things up due to Covid delays. However, I don't understand why you have to schedule a drop off when they are going to just leave it outside your door like they do with all of my other deliveries that I don't have to schedule. I was almost expecting someone to come in and set it up. No such luck. Now for the positive side, because ending on a high note is good  and Ido actually love my treadmill after the rocky start :). I am 5'3"" , 120 lbs and my partner is 6'2"", 190 lbs, and we both use it all the time. I got this one because of how sturdily built it was and how well backed it is by Nordick Track. I wanted something that could be used regularly by multiple people of varying heights and weights. It does this job very well and with all things considered, I would make the purchase again.

  Absolute garbage, had I known that some random trash company called IFIT would hold this hostage I never would have spent $700 on it. Knew it was going to be a nightmare once I opened the box and saw 3 different things saying ""product locked visit trash website to active"". Went to the website where you have to give your credit card info for a monthly subscription to continue. I don't want a monthly subscription, I just want my treadmill to work. There's a phone number listed on one of the warnings which going through call tree options states ""hold the bluetooth button to activate"". Small problem with that, there's no bluetooth on my treadmill. Just a an IFIT button that does nothing no matter how long you hold it.

  I love running and walking, but I never wanted to invest in a treadmill because if the weather is crappy, I would just go to the gym and run or walk there. Well, thanks to COVID-19, I can no longer rely on that option because it's really hard to run with a cotton mask draped across your face. So, one rainy morning this summer, I bit the bullet and bought one. I found this model on Amazon because it was the highest rated for the price range, and I can see why. This is an excellent machine. It is sturdy and reliable. It has great features, like one-touch speed and incline buttons. I'm sure there are a bunch of features I don't even know about because I haven't really explored yet. But it definitely serves my purposes, and it doesn't make that much noise, either. My only regret is not buying this sooner. I would recommend this treadmill to anyone in the market for an exceptional piece of workout equipment.The only thing that wasn't so good is I was not able to secure the kickstand thingy to the bottom so it can fold and absorb shock when it unfolds. But that's not a big deal to me. I just leave it unfolded all the time. And I'm guessing it's user error more than anything. I've never assembled something like this before.

  My bf and I moved into our DTLA Studio last year and had researched treadmills for 6 months before finally pulling the trigger on this one. We decided on this one because it's compact (and it truly is), has all the basic buttons we need (no big screens, no fans, no extra nothing), and the price point could not be beat. Amazon delivered it in no more than 10 days after purchase and it was delivered inside our home! We don't fold the treadmill up as we don't have much furniture but I would definitely see someone with need of more space or people with children to find this option useful and easy! The treadmill is a bit on the heavy side so rolling this treadmill around from one room to another would be quite difficult. We have ours stationary, so definitely imagine where you'd place this baby before your purchase and read the dimensions. The screen is definitely one touch and buttons are nice and big so very legible. We knew we wouldn't need the iFit program since there are hundreds of YT videos to help with your workout routine at home, but the membership gave us a scope of what great workouts they offer! If you're into one on one trainers, this might be a great option for you. This treadmill does have bluetooth capacity, however it does not connect to your phone/tablet for music on say Spotify or YT. It only connects to the iFIT app and you can only use this app if you're paying for it after the 1 month trial. This treadmill also has an AUX input with built in speakers for your iPod. You may also use this input with your phone if you buy a separate adapter. The Flex Select feature on this treadmill is by far my favorite. When running on this treadmill, you can choose to exercise as if you were running outdoors (on concrete) or run indoors, sorta gliding, as you would at an indoor gym so intensity is an option and you can change it by turning the orange silicone knobs at the bottom of the treadmill. The belt is sturdy and if properly maintained this treadmill will not disappoint you. Lastly, you have options of up to 10% incline with intervals of .5 and up to 10 mph. If you need assistance with assembly, usage, or just workouts don't be afraid to use YT!

  The treadmill is great. It's sturdy, runs pretty quiet and doesn't have a large footprint.  Great shock absorber system. I'm very happy with it. Highly recommended.  Notice that there is no assembly service in Norman Oklahoma, as well as other places I assume.  However the most frustrating thing is that they tell you that in order to use the treadmill for the first time you must unlock it by logging in to the iFit website and activate it.  This requires creating a user name and putting in your credit card info which they say they will not use.... you then have to cancel your membership before 30 days so they won't charge you.  I don't want the iFit service.  I am a certified trainer, I just want to run and I certainly don't want to give you my credit card info.  After some time trying to find how to bypass this, I contacted nordictrack customer service and they told me that you don't need to activate it online if you don't want the iFit service. Just hold the iFit button for 30 sec and it will unlock your machine. It worked like a charm. I wish this info would have appeared on Amazon, maybe included in the product info.

    Bought One of These 10 Years Ago - Bought One Now - They're Still Great!
  
",4.0,Spiffyman,"Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2020","* OVERALL *
I had bought a NordicTrack treadmill similar to this years ago and got a lot of great use out of it. The only reason I sold it is because we were moving and the rental we were moving in to didn't have space for it. We bought a new home recently and I have a big workout space now and tracked down a similar model from Amazon and got it in January when they were running some discounts. Overall it's been a great machine and I've already put 50 hours and about 200 miles on it.

* ASSEMBLY *
I bought the package deal where an installer comes to assemble it, so all I can say is that he didn't have any issues and it took him less than an hour. Been solid since.

* GENERAL USE *
It's a mid-range treadmill but it gives me most of what I need. I do run some of the iFit programs that vary speed and elevation and every once in a while it would be nice to have more than a 12% incline, but not very often. When it comes to speed, I'm rarely sprinting even at the max speed of 12mph, so it's plenty fast. Speed and incline controls are decently responsive but there are times you have to hit the button more than once to get it to react. Transitions to a higher or lower speed or incline are just fine. Wouldn't want them any faster or slower.

The width and length of the treadmill are great and I'm 6' 4"" and never feel crowded.

I have some suggestions for improvement, but I'll write those below.

* iFIT *
I've used some of the iFit programs and enjoyed them. Probably a lot more to get out of them, but the screen on the treadmill isn't huge so not as engaging as I'd like. It's more about the automatic program control of the speed and incline that's valuable to me.

The buttons on the touchscreen are kind of small and not super responsive. They work and I get around fine on it, but it can be sluggish and often requires multiple attempts to get a button to respond. Kind of like a smartphone ten years ago. Not perfect.

The other big issue is that I have not found a way to sync the iFit program to a computer screen or TV in any way. My old NordicTrack with iFit allowed you to use the iFit website and sync what was going on with the treadmill on the computer screen. I think that feature has been removed as far as I can tell and there's no way to use an AppleTV, Roku, computer, or anything else to see a larger picture of the screen so you're left with a small screen only. I called support multiple times on this, but it seems this isn't available and only high-end models have an HDMI out (probably a $2 part) that would work perfectly.

Oh well, I'm living with it, but it was a surprise to find out that this treadmill couldn't do what a similar NordicTrack treadmill 10 years ago could do.

* SUGGESTIONS *
Don't want these suggestions for improvement imply that I'm not happy with the treadmill. I am!! It can just get better in a few key ways:

- See my iFit comments above. It's really been crippled in order to convince you to buy a much more expensive version just for the bigger screen. That's too bad.

- There no great place to put a water bottle. There are spots on the side, but they don't work like a drink holder at all and are kind of awkwardly placed. There's a shelf down below the controls, but I'm not quite sure why it's there except to store stuff like a HRM or other gear. Not a good spot for a water bottle while you're walking/running.

- Noises: overall I'm happy with the noise level of the machine, but it makes a strange noise ever time as the incline goes down around 0. My other treadmill did the same thing, so I guess it's normal, but still kind of strange.

- Like I mentioned above, buttons could be more responsive. When you're sprinting above 9mph and you're ready to end your interval you reach for a slower speed and it would be great if it responded the first time every time.

Again, overall I'm very pleased with the machine and it gets me through Idaho winters without gaining 100 lbs. Don't know what I'd do without it.",Display Size: 7 InchesStyle Name: T 7.5 S Treadmill + 1 Year Membership

  This is a fantastic treadmill, especially given the price! Complaining about this treadmill is truly a first-world problem. For starters, it is VERY reasonably priced considering most treadmills start around $1000. Additionally, some have mentioned that it's loud. We'll yes it's a treadmill...it's literally supporting your full bouncing weight as you run on it, so of course it makes noise. The machine itself isn't really all that noisy even when the belt is at full speed. Lastly and most importantly, YOU DO NOT HAVE TO REGISTER FOR IFIT!!! To bypass, simply hold down the iFit button for 30 seconds and the treadmill will work. If you're looking for a basic treadmill with multiple speeds, inclines, and the option for iFit, this is for you!

I am very capable of putting together anything that comes with instructions but due to the weight of the pieces you should definitely have help. Also with the instruction not to used power tools when assembling the treadmill I had to use my drill on the hand rails to make them sufficiently tight. I simply did it little by little but without it there was no way I could get the screws tight enough to not wobble or seem loose.

  I have been using this for the past few months, its really nice to use and very useful exercise equipment for home. The quality of the product is really nice. No noticeable noise and smooth running. Has that professions feel to the product. Wish I did buy the one with the bigger display but the tablet/mobile stand was useful.Had a bit of difficulty to assemble, could have designed it better for assembling, but worth the effort to get it assembled.

  Easy to assemble.  Even though instructions call for two people I was able to assemble it myself.  The treadmill is very stable and well built.  The main thing I dislike is the mobility.  To move the instructions tell you to grab the handles and use your foot to secure the leg and then tilt the treadmill back on the wheels.  I feel this is dangerous.  My old Proform had the wheels in front so that all you had to do was lift the handles and move it into position.  Hopefully they will improve follow on models.  There is no fan so I purchased a clip-on from Amazon.  Bypassed IFIT.  If they had offered it free for 2-3 months I would have signed up and tried it out.  Could not find data in IFIT and how it would help me on the treadmill..  Maybe later they will offer it free for 3 months to see if it works for you before since you have to give them a credit card.  One assembly problem.  The silver ground screw would not work per instructions so I had to use a substitute.  I have a case number but response is very slow.  Consider this a minor problem.  Bottom line is I love the treadmill and happy with my purchase.

  This treadmill truly surprised me with the size and how well it works. Iâve been able to run pretty fast on it and the incline is pretty legit. Itâs like a knock off treadmill from orange theory. Itâs not too big, and not too loud. I have it in my room in my tiny NYC apartment and my roommates canât ever hear me using it. Iâm very happy with this purchase. I was skeptical because of how cheap it was, but SOO WORTH IT! Also, to skip the IFit subscription when turning on, just hold down the IFIT button until the subscription screen goes away!Also, semi easy to assemble. I had my boyfriend help me put it together, and it took us maybe an hour because he was making me actually help him ð

  We ordered this treadmill when gyms closed in 2020. It took quite some time to be delivered, but that's what happens these days.  Now that it's here, we really LOVE the quality.  It's stable, quiet, and can be used both in simple form or with ""bells and whistles"".  Two key things keeping it from 5 stars:1. It's an effort to get it put together.  Takes two people and some patience.2. The iFit requirement is a pain as other reviewers have mentioned.  iFit is required to activate your machine--I could not find a way around it.  I now have to go through and cancel the membership to ensure we are not charged after the 1 month trial. We have no interest in the iFit features, but if the live classes, etc. are of interest to you they do look good, and have quite a bit of variety.

  First off this treadmill is not easy to assemble. I am an engineer so I can put things together but the manufacturing of this is poor. Two bolt holes were not threaded well and I could never get the bolts to thread in. One bolt hole was so far off I couldn't install that bolt. Every bolt felt like it was going to strip if I tried to install it.After I finally got it installed I was very disappointed. It claims that it can be used without the subscription. well, yes, but ONLY in manual mode. The product description says it has 20 BUILT-IN workouts BUT you still have to have a subscription to use them!!! This is very deceiving and in my opinion wrong. If they are built-in then they should work without a subscription. Very disappointed in this but how are you supposed to return a treadmill after it is assembled and the box was destroyed trying to get the pieces out. This is wrong.

  First tio - you do want to get a ratchet set if you don't have one. Recommend the DeWalt one from Costco. The bottom bolt nearer to the middle is particularly difficult.That's not the reason for my 1 star review though. Sure, it's not the easiest to assemble and it's kinda weird to adjust it so that it's completely stable. It's the Amazon pricing and price matching policy.10 days after I bought this item, Amazon sold the T6.5s for $200 less. I called and they won't price match. Take your business elsewhere if you're expecting good customer service.  I'm now going to activate Wilibuy which I get from Capital One to get alerted when Amazon is not the best option.If you do end up getting this, there is one thing I liked - the $20 delivery to any room. The fellas were easy to work with.

  When I saw the treadmill on line and realized it had to be assembled, I wondered:  Can an 87-year-old put together 10,000 parts and make a whole machine?  When the package arrived and I convinced the strong delivery men to lug it inside, I opened it and sure enough:  10,000 parts!  Or so it seemed.  But I set to work and, over two days, labored for about 4 hours.  Voila!  My very own treadmill.  It works just as well as the one I remember from that expensive gym I no longer belong to.

  You donât have to go to ifit.com to activate the treadmill. The treadmill is Not locked. This is very deceiving and Nordic Trac should not allow the wording. As a previous reviewer said. You can activate the machine by simply push and hold for 30 seconds or so the blue ifit button on the control board. Make sure you put the key into the proper slot first. Safe yourself the fee because they want your credit card. If you pay extra for installation when ordering, the mechanic should know this. But they donât!

  We enjoy our long walks outside along Lake Michigan when weather permits, but Chicago weather doesn't always allow for that, especially during the cold months. So, we decided to get a treadmill so we could continue walking/running indoors when needed. Build quality is good and sturdy, and it doesn't feel like my 200+ lbs is going to make it fall apart like most cheaper products. I did have to replace a part that was broken when I unpacked it. It's really heavy and bulky and the delivery guys really struggled to get it up to our second floor walkup apartment, so I was surprised not more was damaged. The part was replaced very quickly once I supplied the necessary info.Assembly took a while but the directions are clear and easy to follow. This model has a huge screen and came with a 1-year subscription of iFit included. Both features are awesome! Following behind a hot trainer on screen as they guide you through all sorts of workouts all over the world is like dangling a carrot in front of a donkey. It's motivating and you get to ""visit"" some really cool places! Plus, you don't have to change any of the speed/incline settings because it happens automatically while you're following the trainer. It's like being right there with them!  Very happy overall with our purchase!

  I got this treadmill for casual running and walking on my path to losing weight and not having to go to the gym every single time I wanted to hop on a treadmill. I didn't need bells and whistles or a fan so this treadmill was what I needed. This treadmill is great but after about 2 miles, it starts to squeak a bit. Also, the belt is not completely lined up in the middle and we've tried to move it over but to no avail. We even asked our installer to see if he could move it over so it didn't rub on the right side of the platform but he couldn't move it over.I'm still very happy with my purchase though.

  Upon assembling this treadmill, the ground screw (not the throw away screw) did not fit into the frame as the hole was too small.  I was able to simply use a smaller screw.  Unfortunately, when I was attaching the crossbar on the top by the console, the four screw holes were again too small for the frame and would not be able to screw completely in.  I quadruple checked that I was using the correct screws.  I am having this treadmill returned which is a huge hassle to me in terms of time wasted.  This is a poorly built product in terms of the machining.  I could not say if the treadmill is good in terms of the motor display etc. as I could not get past the problems.  Sure I could have drilled out the holes but who would want to have to do that for a $700 item.  The parts fit imprecisely and overall this treadmill is a joke.  Perhaps it was manufactured during the pandemic peak in China.  Truly this is one of the worst product experiences I've had in some time.  I actually give it zero stars.

  I've only has this for a day, so I'll focus on assembly and can update the user experience after using it for awhile longer.Unpacking: This thing is heavy AF. Required two adults and a dolly to get into the house. Nothing was missing or damaged. Be careful when removing the base from the box as the console, including the touchscreen monitor, is stored under the base during shipment. The base is by far the heaviest component in the box. I suspect that most of the complaints on here about broken consoles are a result of crushing the console while removing the base from the box, so be careful there.Assembly: This thing is harder to assemble than your standard Ikea shelf, but no so hard that you need to hire a professional. You will, however, need a second adult to help you out as some steps require a second set of hands. You will also need a phillips head screwdriver and a socket wrench. Everything else is included. As far as instructions, I would have preferred better illustrations. There are YouTube videos with folks assembling these and I strongly recommend watching those along with reading Nordictrack's instructions. It would have been extremely frustrating trying to assemble this thing on those instructions alone without those helpful YouTubers.Ifit: I'll update once I've had a chance to really explore the software. Signing up for my free year was super easy. I read another review indicating that you need to pay for a year upfront with the free trial and then get reimbursed later. That is not my experience. There was a card in the box with an activation code. That code set me up for a year free. I paid nothing on activation. Zero. However, it did require credit card info because, after a year, if I do not cancel, it will automatically charge my account for the next year. This auto-renew feature sucks and they are clearly banking on people forgetting to cancel before the year is up. I will be taping a reminder to my machine to cancel before the year is up so I am not charged.Audio: There is audio input, but not audio output, so you can plug your phone in and listen to music through the treadmill's speakers, but the reverse is not true. You cannot plug in headphones to the treadmill to listen to workouts through headphones. There is also no Bluetooth on this 6.5si. That's a total bummer as my machine is in my living room and everyone in the room now has to hear my ifit videos because there is no way to listen through headphones.Touchscreen: The screen is not as sensitive as I would have liked. I find that I have to press buttons several times to have it recognized. That's a bit annoying.Fan: Because it was brought up in other reviews - no, there is not fan on the 6.5si. I was able able to get a cheap clip on fan off Amazon for ten bucks, so the lack of fan is definately not a deal breaker for me.Overall, I'm giving this one 4 stars. So far, I feel like I got what I paid for, but will update again when I've had a chance to wear it in.

  For the price, I would think that they would include all the tools needed to assemble this machine. Assembling it requires a wrench, I had my own by i would have preferred the rounded ones that usually comes with the tools when you are required to tighten bolts. Especially in such tight places. The included L screw driver was oddly shaped as well, making it hard to use.After assembly, if you try to start it, it will start beeping and wont stop until you sign up for ifit. Where you have to submit our personal information including credit card info. Then after all that, you still have to download the ifit app and give them all kinds of permissions. I bought this machine to work out, not have to install an app and let it track me. It gave me a 1984 big brother watching you kinda vibe. Again I bought this 700 piece of equipment to exercise, what I got was an app on my phone that wants to track everything i do. No thank, no where on this listing for this piece of equipment did it mention that you need to download the app onto your phone to activate this machine inorder to use it. If you do not agree to the terms of use to let ifit monitor you through your phone then you cant use it. Why does a treadmill need my location data.

Another design feature I noticed is the tread is trimmed less wide so it won't fray along the edges. This was a problem with my old treadmill that caused dust and lint balls. So, very happy about the Nordic Track quality and design. And, assembly was easy. Highly recommend.

  I didn't want to write a review before I had enough time to properly use this treadmill (going on three months now). And so here's what I think:I usually run, walk, and jog 15 to 20 miles a week. So far, I haven't had any problems. The treadmill has performed flawlessly. And for the price, you can't beat it. It's less than $700 on Amazon. And it does everything you would want a treadmill to do. It has a OneTouch incline control--up to 10%. And the speed tops out at 10 mph. Really, how long can someone run at 10 mph? You can set the incline and speed manually, or you can choose from different pre-programmed training options. These options are a nice change if you get into the same-old routine.  I would recommend this treadmill to anyone who is looking for commercial grade quality for a reasonable price.Pros:  Superior options. Great warranty. Reasonable price,Cons: None

  This machine is a great value, and very full featured. I assumed it would be perfect for me as someone just getting started exercising regularly, but after about a month of use I am starting to wish it had purchased one of the higher end models. I am starting to find the maximum incline of 10% to be limiting. Since I only have room for a single exercise machine, having one capable of a 20% incline (like some of the higher end Nordic Tracks) would be very useful.I have also rigged up a fan to help keep cool while working out. Many of the higher end machines have a built-in fan, so I regret not going up one level to the 8.5 Si, which would have provided a fan as well as a 12% max incline.

  We are really glad we bought this treadmill. We bought the 8.5 model. It is well built and good looking. We really enjoy the iFit membership and use it almost daily. The workouts and trainers make the whole experience more interesting. We didnât have any issues being billed for the yearly membership like others complained about - maybe that used to be an issue but not for us. Fold up and take up very little space when not in use. Had ours for over a month and very happy with it.

    Good treadmill; ifit ""benefit"" not ready for prime time
  
",4.0,L. E. Castro,"Reviewed in the United States July 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  The treadmill assembly was pretty involved but it's worth it for such a steady (and I hope, durable) unit.  Only drawback is the ifit membership required to activate the machine the first time.  Ifit software is buggy and unreliable and their customer service is weak.  I just quit it but I'm happy to be left with a very good treadmill.UPDATE:  Treadmill stopped working all of a sudden.  The machine would power up and make a grinding noise but the console controls wouldn't do anything.  Frustrating getting service due to long waits on the phone and needing to be near the machine with the motor cover removed.  Finally had everything lined up and the technician could see nothing mechanically wrong with the unit.  Told me to hold the iFit button down for 45 seconds.  I counted down and told the tech that it wasn't doing anything after 45 seconds but kept my finger on the button when all of a sudden the console reset and all was well.  MORAL:  if your machine stops working, try holding the iFit button down for a long time before calling support.

  This is a great treadmill, however the hardware included does not include everything needed to actually assemble. If purchasing save yourself a headache and keep the original grounding screw to reuse as the one provided is too large. You will also need to purchase four rounded  #8 x 1&1/4 screws for attaching the pulse sensor bar to the upright posts. The screws included to do this are #10 and do not fit. You may be able to get them to fit if you drill the holes out but i didnât want to risk that. Even with all these issues itâs a great machine and I would buy it again.

  This was the biggest waste of time and money in the entire world. We have spent hours assembling, disassembling, and on the phone with Nordictrack trying to receive parts to make the treadmill work. After owning for 2 months and never even having the chance to use it- we finally decided to return. We called NordicTrack 2 separate times to tell them the tread did not work, and each time they sent us a part, and each time the part was incorrect. At one point the sent us an entirely new control panel- which wasn't even for our model of treadmill. We finally gave up and contacted Amazon for our money back - thankfully they were able to help.

    True to it's description. Wide, sturdy & quieter!
  
",5.0,Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States April 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  In comparing all the options that the different products had with what was important to me, this was my best choice. And I've been very happy with it! My compromise in getting this one was that the display area has more buttons and functions and is bulkier than I was looking for, but I'm sure that helps with it's stability. Other things I was looking for that it does have is that it is solid, sturdy, wide, the weight capacity that I wanted, is quieter than my last machine, a price within my budget and speed -which the walking machines I was looking at didn't have.The feature I love is iFit, which I didn't buy it for and didn't think I'd use, but I'm hooked!But for the machine, I gave it all 5 in ratings, because it is true to it's description, what you read and see is what you get. It was easy to assemble, I'm a 54yr women and did it myself. I had a brace to use to hold it up, but after realizing this was only for the hydraulic lift, which I don't plan on using, you wouldn't need the brace or second person if you're just leaving it in place. But I'm impressed, it's easy to lift, feels safe.After using the machine, the only suggestions for improvement is if you are using the iFit option. The machine doesn't have a decline, so when they are going downhill, I just increase the speed to try and offset that and get a better workout. To use iFit, you need a tablet or phone, it's not on the screen. It has a ledge at the bottom of the display area to hold it but I bought an flexible phone attachment to hook it to the top so it's more eye level and then sometimes when doing a CrossFit where you hop off the machine I can just flip the direction of the phone and continue following along!

  This machine is full of problems. it's super heavy, loud, the footboard comes out so far you hit it while jogging if trying to stay close to the screen area, it's loud, and just old school. You might as well spend a bit more and get something of quality. It gave me the worst shin splints of my life after just light jogging. The best use we've gotten out of it is my cat sleeping on it.  Also, it was 800 bcuks when i bought it, it dropped to  629, and amazon wont refund me the difference--but will let me return and re-buy. Might as well buy from a more trusted, experienced seller (like a wholesaler or gym equipment company).

The delivery people even brought the treadmill inside, which I was thankful for because it's heavy!  It took a few hours to put together but wasn't difficult.  My wife and I used it for walking 20-30 minutes at a time and with incline. Treadmill worked great for 1.5 months and then the motor controller malfunctioned. Nordictrack customer service was quick to diagnose the problem and quoted 7-10 days for the part to arrive. I checked their website and the part is listed as out of stock.  It has been 3 weeks and no part and customer service is giving me the run around. I do not recommend this treadmill and customer service is terrible.  I will be returning.

  I have been using this for a couple months and it has been great. I get to work out whenever I want and don't have to think about driving to the gym or getting someone to watch the kids so I could go to the gym.It is quite heavy so you would want it delivered to an entrance close to where you want ut installed. Due to COVID, the delivery guys only dropped it off in the living room door way. I and my husband had to take it down to the basement. As an afterthought, it would had been best if we had told them to drop it off at the back porch close to the basement.Assembly is best for 2.The purchase came with 1 month free ifit  subscription and signing up on with ifit was required but credit card details was OPTIONAL. I had read a lot of reviews regarding this and since it was optional, I didn't enter any credit card details so I don't need to call anyone to cancel.The manual is quite handy and don't forget to put the KEY on the treadmill.Also, when done with workout, take the incline down to 0 and speed down to 1, otherwise, the treadmill would take a while to start up during your next work out.Its truly been an awesome experience.

",5.0,M. Williams,"Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2021","









  
  
    
  I've been trying to get more exercise and have been upping my daily steps. Since we're all working from home, sitting has become the norm. When the weather was nice, I'd walk around the neighborhood, but now that it's winter... I'm back to sitting. Thus, the treadmill.Set up wasn't too bad. It was just my wife and I, and it took us more than an hour. In retrospect, I wish I had sprung for the set up service. Once assembled, it seems to be a nice machine. Sturdy and comfortable. It has a lot of features - most that I don't use. I basically use the speed and the incline, but it can do SO much more if that's your thing.It folds up and down very easily, you don't have to be exceptionally strong or coordinated to do it. It moves with ease, too, but I'd recommend 2 people.The deck is pretty comfortable. Even though I'm on tile, I bought a padded mat to keep it from scooching, and it seems to help with the shock absorption, too.All in all, I'm very happy with this purchase, and expect many years of use from this treadmill.

  I contemplated to buy this treadmill and its newer sibling, T7.5, but I eventually reasoned that I wouldn't need a screen or  iFit software.  I need a basic treadmill that is well-built, quiet, and just easy to use/maintain.  Also, I thought about a trade off of signing up for a gym, or buying a treadmill.  At this price point, I think this treadmill was a great deal that checked all the boxes that I cared for.  It came in a big and hefty 6'x3' box that you would need another person to carry.  Assembly wasn't so difficult, but I recommend building this with another person to help you hold the treadmill handles, front console, etc.  A cross bar that connects two handles and a front console was challenging to install.  You would have to push hard two vertical arms and handles inwardly to place the cross bar and screw it down.  You may even think that the cross bar would be too short and It took two people to install this.  Besides this part, the assembly was easy if you faithfully follow the instruction manual included.  There are other reviews here about bypassing iFit, but I didn't bother to look for that.  I just quickly signed up on my phone, then cancelled the membership right away.  I do agree that this is a nuisance and I don't approve Nordic Track is making people to sign up for iFit just to activate this treadmill.  If iFit is as awesome and effective as they advertised it to be, then I don't think that they have to force consumers to sign up. I think this rather displayed iFit's insecurity and failure in marketing. (of course this is my opinion).  Using this treadmill was as easy as using a treadmill at a gym.  Once you can look past this iFit annoyance, I think this treadmill is a great buy.  It is sturdy, slick looking, quiet enough to hear your wife (or too quiet), and super easy to use.  You simply hit start, set speed/incline, then run.  I think if you are average Joe like me who just want to run without thinking much about advanced features (though it still comes with several presets and workout options),  then I think this treadmill would be a great option for you.

  I bought my first NordicTrack in 2000.  It's been a great machine but it was time for a new one because the display panel was failing.  I did a lot of research and decided to stick with NordicTrack.  I purchased delivery, setup, and an extended warranty with my purchase.  I was so excited when it came.  The machine doesn't seem as well built as the previous one but the display and Ifit are amazing.  After a few uses, the machine started making a clunking sound.  I went onto the web and submitted an online form for service.  I received a confirmation email but never heard from anyone.  I called about 10 days later and was trapped in their IVR.  It kept wanting me to go to their website to find helpful videos on fixing my treadmill.  I spent a lot of money, I have a mfg warranty, and an extended warranty so I don't want to fix the machine myself.  I called back a 2nd time and got to a customer service rep.  They seemed nice enough but couldn't help me because I needed to be at home with the treadmill so they could help me isolate the sound and then (fix it myself?).  A few days later I removed the hood and found a loose screw that was causing the clunking sound.  I tightened it and it was fixed.  .... until I walked on the treadmill again and there was some other sound.  I don't really use the treadmill now because the sound drives me nuts and I haven't had time to call customer service again.  NordicTrack - just come and fix the damn thing since I paid for that service.  I am very disappointed.

It's a well-built treadmill and looks sleek.My issue is with this iFit subscription they are pushing. All over the packaging, instructions, and the product itself are these little warning labels saying the product won't turn on until you've activated your iFit subscription which of course costs money. What they don't tell you, anywhere, is that you can activate your product by holding down the ""iFit Sync"" button for 20 seconds without having to sign up for iFit. The only reason I knew about the bypass is because I read the reviews of all the people who figured that out after the fact. Completely deceptive business practice. Would buy again, the product is very nice, but the company does not deserve a positive review.

Once the treadmill was put together he said it looks re-furbished and not NEW. He showed me a few parts are loose and when folding- the treadmill isn't closing the same way a NEW one does. THIS IS VERY DISAPPOINTING. At this point, I don't know if they sent me a refurbished one but I paid for a NEW one. I am a true amazon prime member and have ordered tons of items through out the year varying in prices. I WOULD EXPECT THAT WHEN BUYING AN EXPENSIVE NEW TREADMILL I WOULD RECEIVE JUST THAT.

  Received in December so it has been more than 2 months.Delivery and installation: the package was much bigger than I thought. I have asked the customer service, the entire package is about 300lbs with the heaviest piece a little over 100. So yes, if you really want to, you could move the box yourself but strongly recommend buying service to deliver to the room of choice. Similar applies to installation. We are reasonably handy and assembled the machine by ourselves in a little over 3 hours. It does require 2 people as somewhere in the middle it asks one person to hold the console while another person screws. I would do professional installation if I buy it again. Assembly manual is somewhat hard to read but after the fact I do think they are doing the best to be accurate. The tools/hardward kit is very neat and easy to find pieces.Now onto the machine:Pros: works exactly how it's supposed to. Good amount of area to run and iFit helped me to start running again after 8 years. I like to follow the trainers and it makes workout easier and more fun. Given it's Covid time, it also gives me a mood boost to ""travel"" in Europe or South Africa. The incline is pretty steep and I definitely think I worked on different muscle with the hiking session. I used to work out in the gym and other than this might be a tad shorter and narrower than commercial treadmills, it satisfies my needs to run 40+ mins around say 5.5mph without me feeling any different than running on commercial treadmill.Cons: I gave up on the heart rate monitor, which showed 70 sth when I was huffing and puffing. iFit takes a couple minutes to boot every time but I have learned to turn on the machine before I start changing into my running outfit. The clip on the safety key snapped in a couple days but we sort of MacGyver'ed it and still serves purpose. I also wished that I can mirror ipad onto the treadmill screen or can maybe just put the ipad on the console but it doesn't really work as then the ipad will block the fan.In summary, there are a bunch of places that I wish it could be better but I think it already does what I am looking for really well. Happy that I got the machine.

  I was hesitant buying this treadmill due to the negative reviews but took a chance anyway. As for the ifit the only way to contact them is thru email they don't answer the phone. When I purchased the treadmill it came with a one year membership and when signing up it gave me only one month. I had to threaten to file a complaint with amazon and the govt for false advertising to get what i was promised. They quickly responded with correct 1 yr membership. Ifit doesn't ask for a cc for signing up.As for the treadmill it does everything I needed it's reliable and I've had no problems. For the price it's a great buy. Not noisy, size a little smaller then some. I recommend this item

  We have had this treadmill less than one week! The first time my husband used it it worked perfectly fine. The very next day he started using it it completely shut off after 2 minutes of running the treadmill completely shut off and wouldnât turn back on! This is possible the biggest waste of money. We did purchase the protection plan and are currently trying to get a refund/ replacement and it is definitely a huge hassle for a product that is brand new!

",4.0,Miesha,"Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2021","









  
  
    
  4 star but really a 3.5 star because the machine will cause your circuit breaker to trip. You will have to get a good surge protector because it is definitely needed. I do see it as a fire hazard but the only way you can return it is keeping the huge box after it's set up. Which I didn't because theres not enough space in my condo for it. I see as as a way to keep people from returning it. The box shouldnt matter and if the freight company is providong you with the return sticker then they should also provide you with the box even if it cost. It was installed a month ago but didnt use it right away which is my choice. No one keep boxes that big just sitting around especially since so many reviews say that the warranty department is no help. I can see a Class action in the near future if this continues. Sometimes it will override me and incline when I turn it on. Il have to wait till it goes all the way up and back down before I can do anything.  Not sure if it's some kind of mechanical glitch or not. Works fine when I'm walking and jogging but it does make a sound. The sound isnt too loud but it's not quiet so playing music will help override that problem.

  I did quite a bit of research on treadmills before Christmas with the features I wanted, but not too expensive (if I end up not using it as planned) and I wanted it delivered ASAP. This has not disappointed. I have used it almost everyday since it arrived. It did take two of us to put it together because of the size of it, but wasnât too complicated. I did to the 1 month trial of iFit and I really liked the walking tours and various other walking workouts. I really like that the iFit workouts vary the speed and incline for you. I have not renewed the iFit subscription since it expired and the treadmill has also worked perfectly fine starting it manually. Iâm very happy with this purchase

  So far, itâs amazing. I was able to assemble by myself in about 3 hours. The coolest part, it comes with a year of family iFit. I had a few questions getting all set up, and activated, and was able to use the tablet built into it to chat with Nordictrack support, right from the treadmill!!! Love it, love it, love it! One piece of advice, skip the Amazon offered maintenance package, and buy from the Nordictrack website when you registered. You get better choices, for a better price.My only complaint, the delivery crew brought the box to me upside down, even thought the box clearly said, âthis side opâ. Nothing was damaged, but it still left a bit of unease for such a heavy, expensive item.

  This machine was much sturdier than I thought it would be for the price. It did take my husband a bit of time to put it together, but he said the shrink-wrapped package with the screws in it was the best packaging job he has ever seen. It was really organized and easy to see which part went where. This treadmill is way more powerful than I will ever need. I am 71 with some health issues. I love to be able to use the Nordic Track at my pace. The one 'con' I will mention has nothing to do with the machine but with the iFit personal training. They need to make programs for Seniors.

  Good treadmill for the price. Not top of the line but very good for the home. Many people crying about the iFit thing. I agree that it is shady to try to get someone to think that they must sign up for a service to use their physical product, but it's even stated somewhere on this product listing that it is not required. Maybe if people read things through a little better they would not be so surprised when they think they've hit a dead end. It is quiet enough for a treadmill. Haven't used the speakers so can't comment on that but I just set up a tv in front of it so didn't matter to me. 5 stars from me.

  Delivery people left it on a pallet in my front yard not an awesome start.  Heavy as sin took two of us strong men to get it inside.  Parts I received were not drilled properly at the factory so I had to get replacement parts which was pretty simple from nordic track they came fast and free.  Once you are up and running like other reviews say you have to sign up for this bs monthly package to even start using the treadmill, you can cancel right after but its a sneaky shady tactic.  The tread mill as far as use is ok it's a treadmill with incline, speed and etc.  It squeaks a little but after awhile you learn to ignore it.  Once it was all put together and I used it I've not had issues since then.  It's my only treadmill purchase so I don't know how to compare it to others but for the money I paid I would not say I'm overly satisfied with the experience.

When you call the number for customer service they won't even let you talk to customer support until you register your account.  You can not register your account unless you provide a credit card number and they charge you a subscription fee.  There is no way to use this machine at all until you pay then.

  My favorite part of this treadmill is the large screen that has thousands of iFit workouts that make time on the treadmill fly by! There are walks, hikes, runs, HIIT workouts, strength training, and yoga. Beginner to advanced and easy to difficult intensity. All four members of my family have profiles and can do whatever type of workout they want, with their own unique stats stored in their profile. The treadmill itself is sturdy and I love the feature of being able to fold it up for more floor space. I had to hire a professional to put it together for me ($125) because it takes two people to assemble and I didn't have a second person to help me. I highly recommend this treadmill!

  I bought the original NordicTrack WalkFit in 1994 and have regretted selling it for years. Well, NordicTrack has come a long way, baby! This treadmill has saved us this dreary and cold winter and helped us cope during quarantine. No one had to walk on treacherous, ice-covered sidewalks or wade through knee-high snow that Tom on the next block over didn't shovel yet. Instead, we were able to hop on the NordicTrack and work off the stress of the workday, the monotony of being inside for a whole fricking year, and, oh, work on our fitness too. ;)I don't use all the bells and whistles that come with the NordicTrack, and I don't use iFit. I did a trial run of iFit without giving CC info as some reviewers have mentioned is required. Just hold down the iFit logo for 30 seconds and manual mode is activated.  I'm happy to manually adjust my speed and incline rather than using any of the pre-programmed workouts built into the machine too. I'm short and have asthma, so what most people consider a leisurely walk has me huffing and puffing. I'm able to hop on for ten minutes for a quick metal break from editing all day, or I can do a full workout. It's my choice, which I love.Delivery was smooth. Setting the thing up took us a few hours, so plan for that. It's a large machine, so make sure you measure your space before you order the T series. It works great for us in our family room. Overall, I'm really glad we took the plunge and invited NordicTrack back into our home.

  The treadmill overall seems decent for at home moderate use.  I would not buy this if I was a serious runner.The numbers of the screws on the instructions were different than what the screws were labeled, so trying to figure it out added at least 30 minutes to the assembly, which you need 2 people for.Lastly, the reviews about iFit are correct.  There is a label that says that your treadmill is locked and you need to activate it at iFit.com, but that is not true.  All you need to do is press and hold the iFit button and the treadmill starts up, i read that you can do this in another review so i purchased this item, but  I find this labeling to be misleading.Hopefully the treadmill lasts.

  UpdateIcon updated the software to allow manual use of the treadmill so I have increased the stars from one to three.While I am still concerned by the actions noted below, I have increased the stars since that issue was resolved.  I had a previous Nordictrack treadmill for almost ten years, it felt sturdy and while it did need a couple of repairs over the years I would give that previous model 4.5 stars.  Our new T 7.5 S works, but feels less sturdy and less well made -- a number of the pieces do not cleanly fit together, we had to have the belt replaced a couple of months after we received the treadmill, and there is a squeak from the deck when we run even after the service to replace the belt.  (we paid for setup with the treadmill, so these are not due to us improperly setting up the treadmill).  Overall the T 7.5 S is ok, but does not feel like the same quality as our previous Nordictrack.------Original Submission------I purchased the treadmill in September 2019 after confirming that I was not required to sign-up for the ifit service, as we prefer to just use the manual settings.  For the past nine months we have been able to use the treadmill in manual mode, skipping the ifit logon (it took a few extra steps and some delays to get out of the ifit sign-on screens each time, but it could be done).  This morning the screen looked different and would not let us use the treadmill.  I submitted a support request on their website and eventually received an email informing me that I am required to create and ifit account to use the treadmill.That the company can simply prevent us from using our treadmill until we provide them with additional personal information is very concerning.Since it has been nine months since I purchased the treadmill I cannot even return it to Amazon for a refund.  I am following-up with the company and hope they will fit the issue, but given this deceptive and unethical behavior I recommend looking for a different brand.

  Okay... this is a solid treadmill! I love it so far... it has an auto incline and loud speakers! :) you can totally override the iFit activation and use the treadmill without it. The build part was a little tough... 2 people are suggested. This machine is HEAVY! I think it weighs around 200lbs but it is still compact compared to other treads. When building the tread, the grounding screw provided was the wrong width and screwing in the console bar was a little tough without the use of a drill (even though it suggests not to use one). The Bluetooth function only works through the iFit app but you can still connect your phone and listen to music via the aux connection. It is pretty quiet and no squeaking like other reviews.

  I was a bit nervous buying what seems (by price) to be a lower end treadmill.  I'm 190lbs and between my wife and I, we like to run. But running outdoors can be challenging in Va so we decided to enter at the lower price point.  We couldn't be happier with our purchase and are easily putting 20-30 miles a week on our NordicTrack T 6.5S.  The thing was delivered on time (actually a day early, I believe) and was pretty simple to put together.  The box and base are heavy and awkward...definitely a 2-person job!  Directions were easy to follow an everything was in perfect shape coming out of the packages.Really enjoyed the iFit trial we recieved with our purchase, but we haven't renewed.  There are enough workouts built into this treadmill that I can simply use them while watching a show on my 10"" tablet that fits nicely on the control ""shelf.""  I've even set my open laptop on it, but it covers the controls completely.Regarding the ""ride"" of the treadmill - very impressed.  It's really smooth with no jerky motions like I've experienced on some older gym systems.  It's not a quiet machine, but probably similar to any other.  When done, the treadmill folds up very easily to give you a bit more room and keep cats and dogs from walking over it.Overall, very happy with NordicTrack. Recommend that they provide some basic maintenance tips with assembly instructions, but found them easily enough online.

Directions are pretty straight forward and easy to read.Using the treadmill I opted to use iFit just because I think itâs a fantastic program with oodles of resources and trainers(I recommend Tommy Rivs Puzey- Iberian Portugal, to start running!) I only wish I would have gotten the bigger screen instead of the 15 because some of the runs I have been on are just beautiful in location and a bigger screen would immerse you more.  Itâs still suits and Iâm ok with the smaller screen.  The cushion adjustments are fantastic and you can tell the difference while running from soft or hard.

  My first treadmill, trying not to fall into the well-known track of using the treadmill as a coatrack, and having some success so far. It has the right size for my house, runs quite smoothly, the noise level is low (a must for us with a toddler in the house and sleeps a lot), and the library of the guided runs have plenty to work through. We will see how I feel in another year, but so far so good.

  This treadmill is a great value for the price!! It states that it wonât start unless you activate and subscribe to the ifit app but that is FALSE!! All you have to do is make sure itâs plugged in, the emergency pull/plug is attached and hold the iFit button down for a few seconds and it turns right on!Be mindful that the treadmill comes in a HUGE box-itâs heavy and lots of pieces to remove out of the box. Make sure you move the box to the room you want it assembled in. It definitely takes TWO people to put together. It took about 2 hours for me and a friend to put together.Over all Iâm happy with it, runs great and itâs a great size.

  Have been using this for about a month and it works well.  I use it for running - even though some professional reviews say that the horsepower is not sufficient for running, there is no problem with running.If you dont want the ifit subscription just follow the advice of some other reviews- just hold the ifit button down for 30 seconds, and make sure the key is installed when you do this.  After you do that once, you donât have to do it ever again.The box it comes in is very large and very heavy.  Assembly is a royal pain, even if you are handy.  Some steps require 2 people.  So either pay to have it assembled or be prepared to spend 2 to 3 hours on assembly.  I assembled it and am happy with the finished product but it was a lot of work to assemble.

  The treadmill works just fine.  It has a large number of settings - both speed and incline-that makes it easier to challenge myself.  However, there were two problems.  You MUST sign up for IFIT in order to initially start the electronic on the machine, and you get one month of IFIT free, but it is VERY VERY VERY difficult to get in touch with anyone to stop the IFIT monthly charge.  the only way we were able to get in touch with them was from the telephone number listed with the IFIT charge on our credit card, and when we called, they were extremely rude.  I will not buy anything else that has to go through IFIT.  This pairing is with Nordic Track, so they are at fault also.

  It was slightly more complicated assembly than anticipated -- needed a helping hand to hold vertical parts in place, and one of the lag screws don't engage.Treadmill works as intended mostly, but I find that it misses achieving the set incline ~half the time.e.g. iFit or manually set to 6, and the treadmill attempts to raise incline for a few seconds and stops.  It reads as 6, but I can tell it's clearly not there (almost 0).  This is usually fixed if I brings down the incline manually to 0 and manually (using ^ button) to the right setting.  Kind of annoying, but not a show stopper.

  Original review:Very nicely packaged to protect the components during shipping, expect to spend ten minutes or more just unpacking and laying out the components. Assembly was straightforward and easy enough though the supplied allen wrench was a bit short handled to make torquing down the bolts easy.  You will need a good grip or a small cheater bar to get them tight without a struggle.  All of the bolts had locktite applied to them so they aren't going to wiggle loose any time soon. The assembly instructions were very clear.  It took me two hours to assemble it. There are a couple of points in the process that will be made easier and safer with two people and that might cut your assembly time.The unit powered up easily enough but popped the ground fault outlet in the circuit immediately when the motor started.  If you are going to plug this unit into an outlet on a GFI protected circuit you are going to either need to remove the GFI outlet from the circuit or buy an arc filter. The instructions state that the treadmill will perform on a 15A circuit, which is a typical lighting circuit, but a 20A circuit might prove to be better in the long run so that you aren't popping the circuit breaker every time something else on the circuit turns on while the treadmill is running... like a vacuum cleaner or space heater.The motor is relatively quiet and definitely smooth and strong enough to handle a 220lb load.  The goal being to drop the load down from there. I've only tried walking on it so far.  I'm going to have to work my way back up to jogging as I haven't done much of that in years and I've had surgery on both knees.  Walking at speeds 2 or 3, even without upping the incline, provides a great workout.  The incline controls are easy to reach and operate smoothly. The unit is rock solid on our floor.  The tread is long enough for jogging, no doubt. The controls are ergonomic and clearly labeled. The screen isn't huge but it is clear and provides all the data I need.  The heart rate monitor matches my apple watch exactly.So far, so good. Couldn't be happier with the quality of this machine for the price that I paid.Update:My wife noticed that the left hand pulse sensor didn't work when she tried it for the very first time... the same day we completed the first review/set up the treadmill.  The product is registered and I followed a link to customer support on NordicTrack's site. I reported that the left pulse sensor didn't work, and that the track was squeaking with every step when my wife sped up the track to jog on it.  I received an email reply with a case number and was told that I would be contacted by email or phone with next steps ""shortly"".Bottom line: Works fine for me as I'm just walking fast. Track lube cured the squeaking problem. Amazon's customer service did respond and took care of us. Thank you Amazon.

  The treadmill itself runs great. Smooth, long belt with lots of cushion and I never get shin splints, aches in my feet, or any other pains I've gotten previously from running.But the operating system is horrific. It's some ancient form of Android used by Neanderthals. Everything is slow, even with Bluetooth and location services turned off. It saves my workouts half the time, rarely can connect to iFit, and most of the programs run only with an iFit subscription. So you have to pay to use most of the built in programs, and then get to watch them not work.At the end of the day, I don't really care about the touch screen and programming. The treadmill itself runs great, and if that's all that matters to you like it does to me, then maybe get it. But if you care at all about your programs, recording your stats, or having a fully functional product that doesn't aggravate you, don't get it.

  I'll admit, I was VERY skeptical of this treadmill because of the price and issues I'd heard with NordicTrack in general. So I'll start from the beginning. I initially ordered this treadmill and the technician assistance in October. The technician discovered damage as he was putting it together. Amazon refunded me for everything because they did not have it in stock to replace. Days later, the treadmill was in stock again so they sent the replacement. The replacement arrived in the morning and technician in the afternoon. It took maybe 45 mins for him to complete the set up. He tested it out for me and showed me the workaround for iFit.My skepticism was the price compared to quality. I thought me being 250lbs would have me feel like I was going to break the equipment. That is not the case! I've run at the highest speed (10 mph) and highest incline (10%) and it felt safe and stable. Now if you're jumping up and down at 10% grade you should expect to break the hydraulics. I love this treadmill. It is used at least every other day with no issues.

Assembly was a a pain point for sure, but after a trip to the hardware store I managed it. The good part is that the whole household has been using it, even as the weather has warmed up and we can exercise outdoors again. I actually like the steep incline hikes and runs a lot as we live in a fairly flat area, and it's fun to go up Mt Kilimanjaro or Mt Baldy with a guide. Good buy.

  I've never liked treadmills with massive screens that I'm forced to stare at, so this one was perfect. My husband and I assembled it together, however it is VERY heavy and definitely a little difficult to assemble. If you can afford to have a professional do it, I would recommend that, and wish that we had hired someone to do it for us. I say this because the heart rate sensor bar doesn't work very well, and at times it was difficult to figure out which screws to use. It was extremely time consuming and just difficult. Aside from assembly, the treadmill works great, we've both used it for running and walking. If you're ok with not having super fancy tech on a treadmill, then this is a good one to choose. It does a good job of measuring distance, my Fitbit is usually recording the same distance or something within a tenth of a mile.

  First, itâs HEAVY. It took me, my wife and college student son to lift the belt section upstairs. Consider paying extra to have it delivered to the room where itâll be used. Second, follow the assembly instructions carefully. Youâll need someone to help for a few parts. Third, you do need to activate iFit but no credit card is required. However, you can bypass the activation if you look it up online. I did have a problem with the treadmill tripping my GFCI circuit breaker. I bought a heavy duty appliance 12â extension cord to plug into another non-GFCI outlet. It also holds your clothes nicely over the console when youâre too lazy to hang them in the closet. :-)

  I purchased this treadmill, my family's first, to overcome our over sedentary lifestyle during the corona virus work from home times and in anticipation of reducing outdoor walking during the winter months. The treadmill was particularly attractive vs. the ""no-name"" competition when offered at ~$250 off and finding online videos to explain the trivial was to bypass the iFit subscription service. The treadmill is very solid, but amazingly easy to fold up. The control console is basic and cheap components, but so far (6 weeks of constant use) reliable and functional. The assembly was more complicated than it needed to be because the instructions in the first few steps contained several errors and some improvisation was required - quite frustrating. If not for the assembly issues I would have given this a 5-star rating.

  Bought the treadmill so that we wouldn't be dependent on the weather and to save our joints. Been using it for a little over a month. There are multiple settings on the treadmill to workout without using the iFit app, but they're not very customizable or give you the option to create profiles, which is why I'm putting a lower rating than 5 stars. The only way to personalize it is through the app, which requires a pricey subscription. The other issue is the treadmill is really large even folded up. The pictures make it look really slim but the handles and legs stick out a lot so just be mindful it won't be neatly tucked away. The performance, however is great and I love having this piece of workout equipment at home. Especially now that gyms are really not all that safe with Covid.

  I personally am thankful for the people who left reviews saying that you do not need an IFIT membership. They're right, but you do need to know how to  Google and read help forums. If you are not comfortable doing this, then you will not be able to even use the treadmill unless you provide a credit card to NordicTrack.The treadmill works fine for me. I do walking. It does what I want from it.Assembly was mostly easy and clear instructions. You can tell they had to do a lot of re-work on the product after it left the assembly line, because there are a lot of instructions that say something like ""remove and discard these screws, and use these other ones we supplied."" I did about 90% of the assembly by myself. I needed help when it came to the headboard; I just didn't have a way to balance the headboard while working to attach it. If you can move it on your own (and yes, it is heavy. I mean really heavy. If you don't lift and move 100lbs+ regularly, don't expect to be able to move it on your own), you should be able to assemble most of it on your own.

I love the way the treadmill speed and incline will go up or down with the trainer - but you can also choose to do your own pace. I had a blast.

  You can't find a better treadmill for the price. The assembly is very complicated, it took my husband four hours to put it together. iFit is used to activate it but you do not have to purchase it, you don't even need to enter your credit card on the app. I'm not crazy over the iFit app for a few reasons, it's far too focused on the trainer and workout and not on the location, feel and experience. You are really paying to workout with the trainer, which means you would be following his pace, incline and time. Thus, should you want to slow down, you have to manually do so.The machine itself is great, I'm addicted to it. The folding mechanism isn't great but it works well enough. It's not huge, so it's not in the way really anyway. There are ten incline levels to the left and ten speeds to the right. Despite it's size, it is very sturdy. Me and my husband are pretty stout individuals and it stays put as you run. I've tested it up to the 6 speed and it holds together well. For some reason, I do feel like it is a bit faster than the time/speed marks. For example, in the gym I can typically do 3 miles in 36 minutes if I start at 4.9 and increase in two minute increments. On this machine I had to start off at 4.0, with the same increase increments and I barely finish 3 miles in 45 minutes. Either way, it's a really good workout.This treadmill is a very worthy investment during COVID-19 and I suggest it for anyone!

    Perfect for the family
  
",5.0,George B Rowell IV,"Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2019","









  
  
    
  This treadmill has proven perfect for the entire family (mom, dad, and 2 teens).It came quickly from Amazon and was delivered on time via Amazon freight.  Assembly was straight forward and took approx 30mins from start.The treadmill is sturdy for walking, hiking and running, and has plenty of incline (12deg) and speed for everyone.The best part, however, is the iFit.  I was a little dubious at first, but these workouts have proven a favorite not only for our family, but for out of town guests and family as well.  It is simply amazing that you can hike the Scottish highlands or run the Boston marathon in the comfort of your home.  Additionally, the machine keeps track of all your workouts so you can compare past performance.In sum...we are all very pleased with the NordicTrack.  Highly recommended!

  Day to day use is perfect.  Fantastic treadmill.  The only negative is the assembly.  It is not too bad but some bolts feel too tight after starting them.  They almost felt cross-threaded but were not.  It took my wife, daughter, and me about 4 hrs.  You must carefully read the directions because there are screw numbers and step numbers on the screw package.  The deck is completely assembled which is great.  Be sure to adjust the tracking per instructions.  To unlock from iFit without signing up, hold in the iFit button 30 seconds.  Worked for me.  Some say to press iFit on the screen, but this treadmill is not a touch screen.  Well worth the price!

  bought this treadmill for casual running and exercising. My kids love it as well. My oldest (12yo) runs on it to keep in shape for soccer season. If you are handy you can assemble it alone but I would recommend two people for a much easier assembly. after MUCH research i found this one to be the best value for the money spent. there are a lot of options but i didn't want to spend $$$ for a treadmill but i also didn't want to get something very cheap that may break easily. so far so good....

    Amazon Customer Service - Needs Improvement
  
",2.0,lizslink21,"Reviewed in the United States April 14, 2019","









  
  
    
  This is my first big purchase on Amazon and was a little hesitant after reading some reviews; however, I gave it a chance. The treadmill was delivered timely, kuddos! Assembly was included and the technician did a fine job. Upon assembly, it was discovered that the digital display is damaged from within. The treadmill motor and everything works so it's still usable. My low rating is for #1 being delivered a damaged product and #2 Amazon Customer Service. I've been bounced around and spoken to several different departments and representatives, each telling me different information about how to resolve my broken digital display. Initially, I chose a full refund which would require another technician to come out and disassemble the treadmill and pack it up..then I would need to schedule a pick-up time..all before receiving a refund and interest keeps on accruing on my credit card. Yes I'm aware I could pay cash but I like my Amazon Points! After much thought, I decided to have the broken display swapped out since everything else seems fine. Simple process right? Ha! I asked the Amazon rep what the process was three different times and he brushed me off stating ""please hold while I call the manufacturer"" and finally I pointed out to him that I've asked the same question three times and he's not answering it. I'm fine if someone doesn't know the answer...it really is okay BUT find someone who does..don't just steamroll the customer who is trying to understand the process in hopes that they will give up asking. REALLY?!?!? I'm told that I will receive a call to talk about my options tomorrow. When I asked about the options, they were different than the other three Amazon Reps told me prior. How frustrating for the customer and I've been super patient thru this process. If you only knew all the different things I've been told in such a short period of time, you would be super confused too! Do I think I'm really getting a call tomorrow to talk options? Nope. I'm pretty sure I'll need to call Amazon Customer Service AGAIN and go over everything AGAIN especially since the ""notes"" they are reading are selectively including only bits and pieces of the conversation. Would I order a large item from Amazon again? Nope. I should've gone with my instinct but I'll try anything once. My suggestion to Amazon, in situations such as this, do not put the burden on your customer to fix the problem. As I stated to the Amazon reps, I paid for a fully functioning treadmill, not a damaged one so the burden should not fall on the customer to fix it. Cross train the different departments so they are educated and empowered to respond to customer issues, rather than bounce your customer to multiple departments. There is a breakdown in knowledge, skills, and communication within Amazon's Customer Service Department.. easily fixed. For now, I guess I'm waiting for a call???

  With gyms closed due to the pandemic, and the weather less hospitable to outdoor activities, our family decided to bite the bullet and get a treadmill for our basement. So glad we went with this model. Its sturdy frame, pared-down screen and incline features are exactly the experience we were looking for, and at a very reasonable price. Not a day goes by without one of us on the machine. NOTE: AND THIS IS IMPOIRTANT--- YOU DO NOT HAVE TO REGISTER WITH IFIT!!! Luckily I followed the instructions of a previous purchaser (Push the iFit button for 30 seconds to skip the iFit registration process and start using the treadmill immediately.) The iFIT registration is a feature that will lock you into a membership, and it's not clear anywhere in the paperwork you get that you can bypass this registration (they ask for a credit card and you are locked into a several-month contract). Other than that irritating iFIT scam, the treadmill is a dream!!

  I live in the boondocks and when the treadmill arrived the packaging was in rough shape. After assembly, the treadmill would not run. I called the service number and the technician helped me troubleshoot the problem over the phone. She had the necessary parts FedEx'd to me and also offered an extended warranty at reduced cost. Once the new parts were installed it runs like a champ. I waited a few months to write a review to verify all was well.  It is a smooth running machine and I enjoy it much more than my previous-not NordicTrack-treadmill.

  My local gym has been closed since February due to the COVID-19 pandemic and I've been working from home since mid-March. Assembly was done by my brother since Amazon is not currently offering the service. He said it wasn't hard to do (he's a carpenter so putting things together comes easy for him).This machine is helping me to keep moving especially in the daytime. The speed is OK - actually faster than the treadmills at my local gym. Was not too keen on iFit at first after reading the reviews from people who felt pressured into using it to start up the treadmill. I'm starting to like it and may sign for the subscription after the 1 month trial ends.

  So far so good! My husband is great with putting things together so this wasnât too hard for him to do alone. The box was very heavy so the both of us had to bring it inside.Once it was set up i registered the warranty and i saw i had to use ifit to start the machine. Thankfully after all the review reading i realizes another helpful review mentioned how to bypass that. So if you donât want ifit and donât even want to be bothered with the 30 day free trial, HOLD DOWN THE BLUETOOTH button until the machine beeps and basically itâll bring you to the start of using the treadmill.Iâve only used it twice and i like it so far, canât complain about anything.

  Treadmill works, but the settings are all off. In English mode, the speeds act as though they are in Metric mode and vice versa. I spent over an hour on the phone with customer support and they told me that there is nothing wrong with the treadmill and the issue is that I just ""feel"" like the speeds are off. I have used a lot of treadmills (I still belong to a gym (for now) and use the treadmills there) and I know my running speed (I run *a lot*). The issue is that support's tests only test the display on the screen, but the issue I am experiencing is a disconnect between the displayed speed on the screen and the actual speed of the belt. I am quite irritated that they are not trying to fix the issue and basically blaming it on me.  I mean, I *can* use on the treadmill and get to a running speed, but the displayed MPH is so off that I have to guess what my speed needs to be on this machine. I have never had this ""guessing"" issue on any other treadmill.

  Love this treadmill. Works great for speed and elevation. Has tons of pre set workouts but I generally just manually adjust to custom fit my runs. The iFit subscription can be bypassed by holding the iFit icon for 30-45 seconds immediately after the first power on. Otherwise theyâll con you into a subscription. This is shady and underhanded but from what Iâve learned most all exercise equipment like this is in cahoots with iFit (come at me, Illuminati). Construction took a little while so be patient and follow the plans exactly (especially the part where it tells you not to torque down the bolts until later) and youâll be happy with the outcome.

    Good machine but some really annoying features....and/or lack of good features.
  
",4.0,B. Gateley,"Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  Firstly, this seems like a good, solid, smooth-working machine.  I was able to put it together by myself (although having a helper would have been nice at a few points) in an hour or so.  Love the pneumatic track lift.The annoyances started upon opening the box to find an attached sheet (picture shown) that says the treadmill is locked and will not start until you activate at ifit.com, which of course requires you subscribe to their services.  They offer a free month, but of course you have to give them your credit card anyway.  In my opinion, that's REALLY bad after I spent $600 to purchase it.  That's my main beef, but there are a few minor things that I think they could have and should have done:  A USB power outlet to keep your cell phone charged; allowing your cell phone to output audio through the treadmill speakers via bluetooth (it connects to it with bluetooth anyway, why not allow audio as well?); a separate volume control for the beeps and the audio (if connected via cable)...if you have your music playing pretty loudly the beeps are just ear-piercing.  Also, I used to have an older NordicTrack treadmill that allowed you to select a pre-programmed track, but then also use the up and down keys to adjust the overall speed of that track, it was great because you could dial it in to exactly the workout you wanted.  That feature no longer exists, you're just stuck with the pre-programmed tracks period....and NONE of them are geared towards a nice relaxing stroll, they are all aimed at people who are already in reasonably good shape and want a good brisk workout.  If you are an elderly person who decided he/she better get back in shape or someone who's doctor told him/her to lose some pounds and get in shape or else, you will have to stick with the manual mode, at least for a while.

  Donât get this system. They have horrible customer service. My treadmill stopped working after a year (light use). This product is supposed to have a 2 yr warranty, but beware, nothing will be replaced unless you spend $159 to call out a technician. Now, the technician arrived, gave a wrong diagnosis. I had to shell out another s***load of money to get a control board (which was bad according to the tech). The new board arrived after three weeks. I swapped it out with the âfaulty oneâ and guess what, the same issue persists. The system does not work. So, all that money is down the drain. Iâll be reaching out to my credit card company to challenge all these charges. Please stay away!!!!

  The reviews on this treadmill really made it hard to buy. It was a little difficult to put together but now I have had it a week and absolutely love it. It does not make any noises that it shouldnât and works perfectly. My husband and and I work out on it daily and are completely satisfied with our purchase.

  loved the huge variety of runs, walks, hikes etc.  always different.  sometimes they talk to much, however...  for example, during a 5K run, the trainer was constantly talking and as a result the camera was always on her.  Never saw much of the Halloween race.  Would have loved to see the costumes...  another example... sometimes  in a run, the trainer again never stops talking and is always in front.  No one wants to continually watch someones behind while running...customer service is atrocious.  emails, calls... never seem to work.  machine was bent and they sent a part to fix but that was it.. no instructions, no follow up?  If if comes to you wrong, I shouldn't have the responsibility to fix it.  They should send a repair person.  Always nice on the phone, but never any followup...  terrible customer service.  finally gave up.  Machine works but is unstable when cranked up and at high speeds but works for an old man like me at my lower speeds.

The pro they sent was very knowledgeable, and said he is setting up a lot of treadmills of this model, and never seen a damaged package. Sometimes not all parts are there, but typically he hadn't experienced any problems.4. ifit bypass - check. Just press 20 seconds on ifit button and the treadmill is ready to go.5. Noise level - check. As any treadmill there is a motor noise, but I can't say the treadmill is noisy - the noise level is very reasonable.It's been just several days, so if anything changes I'll update this review.

  Everything was fine for the first couple of weeks. It took about 2 hours to assemble and its very heavy. But it worked great up until the 3rd week, it stopped working. I called nordic and they sent replacement wires and contol board. They didnt help with replacing these, i had to do it on my own. They said it was eash and there are youtube videos i could watch for it. It was not as easy as they said and one of the screws was stripped, not my doing. I dont use power tools and this screw was already screwed in upon arrival. So i had to buy other tools just to get this screw out. It was a very frustrating process. I wish they could have fixed the issue for me ESPECIALLY because i only had it for 2 weeks.

  When assembling, be very attentive to where the wiring cable should be located. It must not run on top of the half-round bracket that holds the console/hand rail assembly because that sits on top of the bracket and will squish the wiring cable. Once connected the wiring cable is very difficult do disconnect, especially when the console has to be held aloft by a 2nd person while you're disconnecting and re-positioning the wiring cable. Otherwise, assembly was straightforward. I did need to move the treadmill belt a bit to the left because it was rubbing along one edge. It's a solid, well-functioning unit. Although it has several pre-programmed routines, I prefer the manual option. I recommend this item.

    Great Everyday Treadmill
  
",5.0,Justen,"Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  The screen size (14 in) is perfect and the picture is crystal clear - I worried about both of these before buying, but I was blown away by the screenâs clarity. Also, iFit has been great and a few updates have made it even better - youâre able to choose a ton of workouts (walking, running, hiking, HIIT, etc.) from various trainers. Choosing to run without an iFit trainer is also a great option - the Bluetooth speakers are decent quality and pretty loud and I usually either listen to music (which you can also play in the background of your iFit workout) or put my tablet on the console and watch something using the machineâs speakers.The treadmill itself is pretty quiet compared to an old Nordictrack I had and it feels a lot sturdier - no shaking or rattling around. The only complaint is perhaps my own fault as I opted to assemble it myself - there were only a few really difficult steps but the right side of the console is not as seamless as the left side, which is only slightly ascetically annoying.Overall, this treadmill has made early morning runs a lot easier and a lot more fun.

  This is an affordable treadmill that works great to workout at home. I use it in my garage. I am 240 lb and I have no issues sprinting in it. It is very sturdy and stylish. The only thing that I would change to make it perfect is to place the ON/OFF button in the actual display area. However, everything else is great. The display is very nice and it even has speakers built-in. Overall, this is probably one of the best treadmills that you are going to find at this price range.  Great value for the money. As far as the assembly goes, it wasn't too bad. I do recommend having a second person to help out with it. It makes it a lot easier and faster than if you do it on your own.

  It is a great treadmill. Very sturdy. The assembly part is a fun part. It took my husband 5 hours to assemble and get ready to use. But it is worth. I saw some comments about Ifit activation. If you want to skip activation part, just put the red button to the middle of handle first, and then tear off the Ifit sticker from the screen and hit and hold the Ifit button a few seconds. It is ready to use without activation through Ifit.

  This treadmill is great for walking and jogging. My ârace paceâ is 9 to 10 minute miles, so this is really all the treadmill I need.Assembly was a little finicky. I had to contact Nordic trac service about a faulty screw, I received a replacement in about 10 days. Total assembly took me maybe an hour. I watched a YouTube video which helped.Iâve been using the treadmill about 2-3 times weekly since January and it is still performing well. It was noisy for a couple days and suddenly quieter back down- I assume this was the belt rubbing a bit.Overall Iâm happy with my purchase. For less than a yearâs gym membership I can run at home to my heartâs content.

  I previously had the LifeSpan treadmill which I loved and ran on until it literally died under my feet after 10 years. Thought I would try something new, as NordicTrak has such a good rep. I really like this treadmill, works well, quick speed up and down and same with incline, something my prior one was a bit slow about.My biggest problem is with the preset programs. My LifeSpan had in the manual what each preset looked like including speeds and heights based on level. None of these have a way to view the whole rundown. If you go to a preset and wait, after a few seconds the bottom of the screen will list a speed and incline but is that for the first interval, the hardest interval or what?? And how come none are speed only or incline only? They all seem to be a combination of both, something I don't always want. I also can't make a customized program as I could with my own treadmill. This is my main complaint but otherwise I am happy with the quality of this treadmill.

  BACKGROUND: Avg runner that recently finished my first marathon, probably running 20-25 miles per week now with the majority of them being outside. I use the treadmill to sneak in a few miles while being somewhat accessible to family. I have not really tested the full functionality of this treadmill as I am currently doing low heart rate training so, not going faster than speed 5.FIRST IMPRESSION: Good. I paid for someone to assemble it so no comment on that part. I actually have it in my garage. It looks nice, doesn't take up a ton of space, ok screen size, STOP BUTTON DOESN'T WORK.  That is really the only issue for me. I end up just pulling out the safety stop every time... a bit annoying for a 1,000+ treadmill. Everything else seem to work well so I'm just rolling with it rather than dealing with customer service, part swapping, delays, and no treadmill.PROS: gets the job done, space saving, nice button lay outCONS: small screen size,  screen is vertically low meaning if you practice good running form who will not be able to look at the screen unless you are under 5ft, stop button doesn't work, speakers could be louder

    Solid hardware, Annoying software, Unit shipped with defective incline motor
  
",3.0,Matthew Gumabon,"Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  Solid hardware. Cushioning keeps noise level down and motor runs smooth. Online registration with iFit to activate the treadmill is actually NOT required. The treadmill is not an internet connected device, so it cannot check some database to see if you it has been registered online. You can easily bypass the initial activation required screen. When first turning on the treadmill, just hold down iFit button on console until the normal user interface appears. The treadmill is should then be completely usable.Assembly was straightforward enough, but It definitely goes smoother with at least 2 people. Required screws, washers and hex keys were provided and were sealed and labeled nicely. Be careful not to lose or strip any as no extras are provided. The only other tools youâll need that are not included are a larger bit size Phillips head screw driver and an adjustable wrench. Some screws, particularly those that secure the arm handles, will require a good amount of force to drive all the way in. Just be careful to not strip the screws in the process.My unitâs incline functionality seems to be dead or malfunctioning out of the box. Setting the incline value on the console does not do anything. Incline motor does not even make a noise to indicate a jam or broken motor. No matter what value is set, the console just sets it to max value 10, but the incline motor does not do anything. Incline is just stuck at minimum value (parallel to ground). I suspect this may be an issue with the onboard computer or internal wiring not communicating with the incline motor.Not a big deal for me since I prefer training without incline, but this kind of issue would be a serious headache for someone who makes heavy use of incline. This issue and the scammy iFit software is the only reason why I would not give this treadmill a 4 or 5.

I have used this treadmill twice a day since I purchased it. I am so glad I bought it because of the mixed reviews I was nervous to spend the money. Itâs not any louder then a treadmill at the gym. Sturdy. Well built. Itâs not a scam when you go to active your treadmill you just decline to put your credit card on file for the iFit. You still get the 30 day trial (which I think is kind of cool). Money well spent. I never write reviews but I read so many to make this choice on this specific treadmill I thought it was only fair.

  Good, sturdy treadmill, and great value for the money, but the manual is useless- spends more time telling you how to put it together than using it, and there is almost nothing in it about all the features this unit has.  One other thing, the display constantly cycles between time on the treadmill and distance.  I really don't give a flip about how long I'm on it, and I'm sure there are other people who just want the time.  Since I change elevations at specific distances or quit with the same parameters, it find this irritating.Motor went to boot hill about two years after I bought it, started making a loud rattling noise which became progressively worse.  No way to lubricate it, sealed unit.  Called Nordictrack for replacement and was told that they would send out a tech for about $160 to replace it for me.  Told the girl on the phone (she was nice) that an idiot could replace the motor- it's only four wires and two bolts, and in fact I had already removed the motor to verify that it was the part making the noise.  So they sent me the part- I installed it- and now I'm able to work out each morning without ear protection and a fire extinguisher handy.

  The delivery process was a fiasco. (I don't know if the problem came from Amazon or UPS.) After waiting three weeks, the product came with damage - it looked like it had lost a battle with a forklift.  The carton had 3-4 punctures, the walking belt was slightly torn, and three of four screw receptacles for the motor hood were broken.  I discussed the situation with an Amazon representative, who wanted me to repack it and ship it back and wait another three weeks for a replacement.  Finally he offered a substantial discount, so I decided to keep the machine (contingent upon proper performance).  My son and I got it assembled (which took a couple of hours), and it worked after I discovered I could activate it simply by pressing the iFIT button on the console.  After three weeks of use, the incline sensor failed, but a replacement was shipped within a few days.  Installation was very easy.  The treadmill has been working well since then.

  So far the treadmill works as advertised.  The base is the heaviest part and you will need help moving it into the house.  But it can be assembled by one person if needed.  I like that it automatically syncs with my Polar OH1 heart rate sensor.  I had to jump through a few hoops to get it to pair with my wireless headset but that is also working now.  That should be made easier, I am not sure why pairing to a headset is hidden from the user.  Not everyone in the house needs to listen to the coaches instructions.After a few months things are still working OK.  I like the iFit training better then expected.  So far I lost a few more pounds.  I was stuck at my current weight for a year or more, so the extra push was needed.Update:  With the last firmware update they added a Headphone connect option to the warm up screen.  so you no longer need to get into admin mode to connect a bluetooth headset.

I just do manual mode. There are some free guided runs but theyâre not in English haha. I like that it has a warm up and cool down. Buttons are responsive. I do run outdoors but itâs way too hot in Cali right now so I use this to do sprints before/after I lift weights. Could run for awhile on it though. Most Iâve done is 30 min.

  Delivered four days after ordering. But it has been inoperable since day one. They were helpful over the phone and tried troubleshooting, sent a new motor and reed switch, installed motor and waited couple of weeks for switch, installed  with no luck. The next call they said it must be the controller, waited couple of weeks for that, installed with no luck. Next call they finally agreed to send a tech with the next controller since the new one had gone up in smoke when powered on. Waited couple more weeks for controller, than another week of phone tag to get the tech. He installed controller and had no more luck than I did. Another controller was ordered and another tech came out. Installed another controller, swapped motors and nothing. Then he wiggled some wires coming down from the console and this caused the controller to go up in smoke again. When checking the wires he found three of them burned out. So now I have been waiting another 10 days for a console and controller with no information than in process. Almost three months and this thing has n to moved yet.

  I prefer running outdoors and needed a little push to be ""happy"" using a treadmill as I find them all incredibly boring. The iFit technology is so totally worth paying for if you're like me who needs incentive to get on this thing. Although I still prefer running outdoors, this treadmill has been a godsend as I log in miles in between meetings and run 5ks all over the world with some of their awesome coaches. If you're going to cheap out and not pay for iFit, that's fine as long as you don't mind running on treadmills in general. They do give you a year of free iFit to try out. I certainly plan on continuing that membership as I feel it is totally worth it. I believe there are workouts within the system itself without iFit, but I've yet to try those. The treadmill itself is awesome too. I just dust it often to make sure it's clean and that's it. I've had it for over three months and love it! I only wish that I bought one that had a decline too, and not just an incline. Still, go for it!

    Excellent Treadmill
  
",5.0,Alen Yen,"Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2021","









  
  
    
  I'm a daily runner training for 2 marathons a year and run roughly 160 miles per month. Needed to find a good enough treadmill that could accommodate speed work at 6:30 paces. Box came late which created a problem with the installation group. Opted to build it myself which was fairly easy to do. Solid treadmill and as good as anything I've used in the gym. Folding action is smooth and easy. Not crazy about the iFIT software and how long the machine takes to boot because of it, but this is still a 5 star because of the solid running UI and excellent quality of the machine. Had been worried that I should have gone with the Pro level, but this was excellent. At 5'6"" the smaller width is actually preferred. Highly recommend.

  Very satisfied with this purchase. I was honestly overwhelmed with all of the choices when searching for treadmills but I knew I wanted a quality brand and I didn't want to spend a lot of money. This fulfilled those requirements.It is a well built sturdy machine that does it's job. I was impressed with the purchase once it arrived based off of how much (little) I spent. I was able to put it together almost completely by myself, just needed a second hand at the end.I usually hate using treadmills because I am an outdoor runner but weather limits me in the winter, have had this around a month now and use it daily. I can easily mount my tablet and watch my shows while running.

  Awesome treadmill (looks, features, functionality) foe the price.Pros: interactive or manual mode, has Bluetooth and folds to save space.Cons: assembly, heavyI did not see the option to pay for assembly so I (very ânot handyâ) was tasked to put this together. All of the necessary tools were included with the product, but for some steps, (2) people are required and you will need a ratchet set to make things go faster (not supplied).I would suggest to be absolutely certain on where you choose to install this because moving it (although it does have rollers) will not be easy.All in all, I am pleased with the treadmill and very happy with the purchase.

  First of all let me warn you anyone who buys this, do not fall for the iFIT warning that you have to get in order for your machine to run. This is not true. Once you have your machine built and ready to plug-in go ahead and plug it in turn the switch on in the back, and be sure to add on the safety button to the front of the machine. After that press on the blue, or itâs blue on my machine anyway,, iFIT logo holding it down for 15 seconds, your machine is ready to use!!It takes two people to put together, although my husband did it by himself in 3 hours, he said it wouldâve been faster with help.Iâve not used it much since itâs only been an hour when I walked in and found heâd assembled the treadmill! Good luck! Itâs a beautiful machine!

  I purchased the NordicTrack brand for its reputation as a great quality company and product.  I also paid for the assembly of the item and installation as I wanted to start using it ASAP.  We received the item a few days after purchase which was great.  When the folks assembling it tried to put it together, the wrong parts were included.  We called NordicTrack and after a long wait, we were able to order the replacement parts that were due in 2 weeks.  That was 2 weeks ago.  Called again today, waited another long time only to hear it is another 2-3 weeks out.  I have a half assembled treadmill and a large box sitting in the middle of my basement for close to a month now and it looks like it will be another month.  Horrible quality (wrong parts) and service.  I can't comment on the experience with the machine yet for likely another month at least.  Super frustrating!

So far, I haven't tried the guided and coached training sessions - it is on my to do list.I really like the detailed tracking of the workouts via the iFIT app, already reached 736 miles, approaching 1000 miles.Due to the COVID-19 restrictions, I am more than glad and happy to have my own gym, being independent from the weather conditions. Very helpful, especially since my employer has allowed working from home ...My overall summary: Highly Recommended!

  The assembly is complex but instructions are clear. Thank goodness my husband is handy.I'm so grateful to have read about the workaround to iFit.  I did as instructed and the treadmill works great. I have back and foot issues so I wanted one that would be easy on joints. This seems to fit the bill--good shock absorption system. It doesn't have a lot of bells and whistles but I didn't need those and didn't want to pay for them!One little issue: sometimes when I turn it on, the incline starts rising on its own. I have to unplug it then plug it back in to reset. No biggie, just a little annoyance.

  Speed is completely incorrect. The actual speed was 1.0 and it was displaying 3.5 on the screen. The incline was also incorrect actual vs what it displayed on the screen. Heart rate as well. I was walking at a pretty fast pace and it displayed 60. HAHAHA!!! What a joke.It was a pain to even get it started. Trying to avoid all of the useless iFIT app nonsense. Overall, I have to research how to fix all these issues. You would expect it all to be calibrated from the start. Its also not very easy to move. And once you lift the bottom of the treadmill it sits at an odd angle. LASTLY, you can't even use the bluetooth speakers with your music from your phone. The bluetooth speakers are only for use with the iFIT app. LAME!!!!!The box arrived completely destroyed, luckily the treadmill itself was not damaged.

  The unit arrived and was assemmbled, which we paid for. It was fine until 30 minutes in when the display fried and the unit stopped. We thought it was the motherboard. A call to Nordic Track with a video of what was happening resulted in Nordic Track sending a new DISPLAY and saying it was ""easy to assemble"". It wasn't that easy. So after figuring it out and assembling it, voila - same deal. Yep. Motherboard. Nordic Track had not offered to do anything to assemble the display and clearly diagnosed the problem incorrectly anyway. They were only interested in ending the phone call. So this all resulted in a return and a really negative experience. Amazon was more or less OK - Nordic Track was a complete and utter joke.

  We just got this treadmill yesterday. Amazon delivered it with no problems. There was a big dent in the box, but everything was packaged so good, there was no damage to the actual treadmill.  Beware, it is HEAVY. You will definitely need two people to move it. It took a couple hours (with a pizza break) to put together. While tedious, we didnât have any problems.  Going off advise from another review, you can hold down the ifit button for about 10 seconds and it will âunlockâ the machine so you donât have to go through the register process.  So far, we are very pleased. For the price, you canât go wrong. I would definitely recommend this treadmill.

The Smart TV we purchased (TCL Roku) is not compatible)The manufacturer was very short sighted to think that just because the app is built into the console tablet, that their customers would not want to screen share to other devices.

    Impossible to assemble
  
",1.0,adam,"Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  My girlfriend is certain NordicTrack purposefully made it so hard to assemble so that you will give up and pay the extra hundred to have a professional come and do it. Her reasoning is that it's so bad that it can not be attributed to mere laziness on NordicTrack's part, but must be a product of conscious effort.Here are some of the highlights if you're foolish enough to attempt it:-You will need at least two people and six hours to complete.-You will need power tools as some of the screws are too big for their sockets and must be forced in.-There will be screws in corners that no screwdriver can get at. You will need a specialty tool for them.-You will on several occasions have to undo the work you just did and reassemble it a different way.I'm not kidding about that last one. See on step 5 it will say something like attach A to B, but what it won't say is that you need to first move A as far to the left as possible - much further than A should reasonably go. If you do it wrong, you won't notice anything until you get to step 8 at which point you will realize your mistake and begin to curse yourself, anyone standing nearby, and maybe a deity or two for good measure.Once you finally get it built it runs pretty fine. The only problem is the tread keeps slowly creeping to one side and rubbing against the edge. Surprisingly they actually predicted this problem, and there's a good YouTube video online that tells you how to adjust it back to the center. Still it's annoying to have to spend 15 minutes of doing this once or twice a week, which is what I've been doing.One last thing, before I bought this treadmill I bought a $200 treadmill that was (I soon realized) too small for a person of my weight. The only reason I bring this up is because that assembled perfectly as you would expect most things you purchase online would do. So it is perfectly possible to create this thing better. NordicTrack simply didn't want to. I would definitely not buy again, and suggest you don't either.

  Treadmill is great. It goes up to 10 MPH, which is well above what I need, and does an incline up to 10%( I think itâs 10%).My wife and I usually just use it for brisk walks with a high incline. We only use the manual controls and  never the pre programmed workouts.  Note that they try to get you to pay for an Ifit subscription but it is not required.Folding up is fairly heavy, but not hard, same with folding down.Setup was a bit time consuming and one of the screws wouldnât  go in until I used a drill( which the directions expressway said NOT to do).

  I'm in my 50s and decided to improve my cardio during this pandemic. This treadmill has been just what the doctor ordered now that I'm working out at home. Treadmill assembly was pretty straightforward. It's sturdy and pretty quiet at higher speeds. Only a few minor concerns. 1). The plastic motor cover sits pretty low on the belt causing the user to step on it now and again so you must train yourself to run further back on the belt. 2). EZ to fold up but sticks a little when trying to lower it. 3). Heart rate monitor is not very accurate but to be fair I've yet to find any fitness equipment of any kind to have an accurate HRM. IMO, a very good purchase.

When you turn it on, nordic tells you that you that you HAVE TO REGISTER the treadmill before it will unlock. This is a SCAM to try and get you to pay their monthly ifit fee. You dont have to do it. If you press the manual button on the treadmill, it should unlock the treadmill. You may have to hold it for a while. Holding ifit button didnt do it for me.  Holding the manual button did it for me. It is crappy thought that they dont tell you this but rather they tell you that ""product registration required"". Thats BS and misleading and a low thing done by the company for unsuspecting people.

  Iâve never experienced such a disregard for a customer care process and focus. Let me be clear, the people I finally got through too about multiple parts missing were nice and very helpful in one case. Two phone calls where I waited in excess of 45 minutes each. One for missing handrails which arrived separately by a few weeks apart and the second for the rubber handrail covers that took 30 minutes each to heat and stretch to fit. Unable to get them on fully, no surprise as they are no doubt added by machinery to the handles, I ended up cutting them short by 4 inches. The icing on the cake was when I completed the installation some 5 weeks after receiving it and proudly removed the clear plastic protective sheet on the console only to have it remove with it, chunks of the âsatin finishâ on the console. I realized I made a huge mistake buying my second and last NordicTrack product from Icon Fitness.

  Like many of us, the pandemic has caused some restraints with our normal life patterns such as going to the gym and enjoying the equipment that is readily available to us.  With that being said, we decided to purchase the Nordic Track T Series.  It was easy to assemble, my husband assembled it by himself.  The incline and speed features are easy to maneuver.  I read many reviews that indicated you must sign up for iFit to operate the unit, however this is not true.The bluetooth feature is easy to activate.  We are able to jog and exercise while watching our favorite television shows in our home gym.  The only reason why I didn't give the purchase a rating of 5 stars has more to do with our initial customer service experience.  The unit blew a fuse and stopped working.  We have a newer home so the surge protector was doing its job, the manual indicated that an ARC Adapter would help with this issue but it didn't give any other details regarding the same.We chatted on the vendor's website and the agent kept asking if we wanted to return the item after being on hold for over 20 minutes.  We explained that we didn't want to return, we simply needed information on the type of adapter needed to use the treadmill.  We were the told that we would have to be transferred to another department.  After being transferred and placed on another long hold, we received a message that they were closed.Frustrated, we called the toll free number and reached an agent who ran a diagnostic test over our phone and shipped the ARC Adapter within a week.  This representative was patient and resolved our complaint.So far, we love it!

It took a week to get a response. And that did not include an answer nor any assistance, only an inquiry for more information. We proceeded on. It takes a socket set to tighten the screws, which is not in the instructions. And we also took the advice of others about avoiding the scam of IFit membership. However, note that you need to use the key before pressing the IFit button. Ours squeaks but functions, so thatâs the good news. Looking forward to using it now!

  I love the nordictrack treadmill so much I could spend hours on it. It makes it easy for me to accomplish my fitness goals without gym membership which I probably won't follow through with. Assembly was easy with the instruction that came with it and it took my husband about an hour and a half to unbox and assemble. I have to give a big thumbs up to the seller because they exceeded my expectations with delivery. My treadmill came in a day earlier and the delivery guys called me when I was not home and even waited a few minutes for me to reroute and get back home. They were very polite and courteous. I am impressed with theirr service and the treadmill has been serving my entire family. I got the free month of ifit but like other reviewers said, you can use the treadmill without ifit. I just chose to use ifit for the extra challenge.

  I have had the treadmill for 2 days now and am very pleased with operation and features available.- Unpacking: took about an hour- Assembly: took 3 hours, worked alone even thought it said takes 2 people, was not difficult working alone- Start Up: a previous review indicated how to start without signing up for iFIT, which I did not want, pressing and holding the iFIT icon on the main screen for 20 seconds allowed me to start my treadmill without signing up- Operation: in manual mode - simple - which is what my wife and I were looking for, for the advanced user the features offered would provide that as well

  This treadmill is amazing!I am 6'4, 180lbs and I have no issues running on this treadmill.I was a little concerned because I am tall and have long legs and was worried about this treadmill not being long enough, but it is more than long enough for me to run! I typically run at 8.2MPH with the incline.I bought this treadmill because of Covid-19 and having to stay at home, I was nervous because I run and walk, frequently changing the speed and incline during my workout. This treadmill is amazing- truly good quality, very comperable to the commerical grade at the gym I was used to. From the shipping to the assembley to the quality of the product A++Also, you do not need the iFit App for the treadmill to work.

  Pros: sturdy machine and good motor that seems built to handle weight and demands of a person trying to get in shape at home. Display is easy to understand and use and has a lot of features that i hope to become better acquainted with (but i am perfectly happy running in manual mode at desired speed for time being)Cons: this was difficult to assemble. Instructions are fine but there are screws/bolts in awkward to reach places which adds significant time in assembly. There is really no details on parts that should have recommendations for ensuring are in proper order out of the box (rear belt roller and adjustments to make sure the belt is centered / at appropriate tightness). my machine makes noises when i first start running and I am completely unable to diagnose the issue. would have been good to include diagrams / illustrations of how to make sure your machine is finely tuned

  I bought this because I wanted to exercise at home due to COVID.  I wanted something that will last because it is quite big investment. Then I found this by NordicTrack, national brand with long history.The tread is very wide and long that it is very comfortable running long time on it. It has reclining and 10 different speed settings. I tried up to 8. I don't think I can keep with 9, even though I play tennis regularly.The best thing is I can run anytime I want, rain or shine, even after midnight.

  Edit: This saga gets worse as time progresses. I contacted the manufacturer to get the replacement part for the storage latch. I exchanged multiple emails and the manufacturerâs request grow and grow as I continue to provide them more information. After providing them a page of information, they want to know the part number of the item I need. I go to the user manual and give the part number per the manual. Well thatâs not sufficient.  Now they need a photo of the faulty part that is located under this 200 lb treadmill. Thatâs where I pushed back. Iâm not lifting this treadmill. Iâm not âprovingâ myself to a company that should have provided me with a working product to begin with. If this nonsense continues I will gladly load this treadmill up, all 200 lbs of it, place it in its original box and return it to Amazon. I absolutely do not need this level of nonsense in my life over a stupid treadmill. All I wanted was a product that worked correctly. Iâve now gotten myself into an interrogation over a storage latch and the demand to provide the manufacturer evidence of the defect. Zero stars is an appropriate review for this item due to being defective and having horrid customer service.What a mess. I felt like I received half correct parts and half incorrect parts because this was such a pain to put together. Screw holes didnât line up. The left handle was so odd that I canât even describe itâit was so screwed up that we had to trim about an inch of the rubber coating off just to get the pieces to fit together right. And when we were almost finished we had only the storage bar and clip to install and realized the part we received was broken. So it canât be folded until we get the correct, unbroken parts. This is one of those items where itâs apparent that each part is manufactured at a different location and without regard to whether it fits together as a whole. I was so exhausted after we were finished fighting with assembly that I didnât even have the energy to try it. Luckily it does work. But getting it haphazardly put together was a nightmare. Save your sanity and avoid this product or pay someone else to put it together.

  We have the Peloton bike and are huge fans of Peloton, hardware, exercise content and experience.  I am using my Nordic Track while watching Peloton classes on my iPad.  We considered and tested out the 2 more expensive peloton treadmill options.. and chose Nordic Track because it was immediately available and slightly more reasonable price wise.  Peloton had a 2-3 month wait at the time.My family use the treadmill weekly and get good exercise on it.  It's well made.  Sturdy.The heart rate monitor doesn't work well, so we don't use it.  The controls to adjust speed/incline are tough to see in dim lit room, but usable.  Nothing as well designed or user friendly as the Peloton.  Cheap plastic buttons, not dials and toggles.  The LED is nothing like the Peloton monitor.The treadmill works fine.  Works well.  But compared to other purchases in this price range, it's not even close quality or design wise.

  It took a long time to put it together and you will need a second person. It's great for inside walking and the incline gives an amazing workout. I like the iFit programs. There are several that offer strength training during the walk which was a nice twist to treadmill training. My only complaint is that is does squeak a lot when I jog. I've contacted customer service and like the others posted, they are slow to respond (if at all). It started squeaking a month after purchase. I followed suggestions on YouTube and the Company's website and it's still squeaking. Guess I will just have to live with it. Overall it's a good treadmill. I just wish customer service was more responsive in providing a solution for the squeaking which clearly affects a lot of their machines.

  Itâs a great value for getting a treadmill that has motorized incline, ifit capabilities, and came in 4-5 days.  Assembly was pretty straightforward and for even the novice person comes together easily.  Hold the ifit button down for 15 sec and you get around the requirement to use ifit.  Seems like decent quality but I removed a star because the belt doesnât seem tight enough and during assembly some of the plastic seemed thin and brittle and made me think itâs not going to last.  We shall see.  Otherwise this treadmill has features that you  cannot find at this price and thatâs  why I think the value is so high. Free prime shipping and delivered  it inside my garage just where I wanted it, that alone beats saving a few bucks at the store and having to bring it home myself.

  I've been using it for about 2 months. My husband and I run at least 30 min a day and we like it so far. The treadmill is big but not TOO big to take up a lot of space. We bought it during the quarantine and we couldn't get an expert to assemble it so we had to do it ourselves. It is fairly easy to assemble it as long as you have the right tools and you read the manual very carefully. I gave 4 starts for 2 reasons: First, they ask you to sign up for iFit in order to activate your machine (it's a trial so just make sure you cancel the trial) Sencond, sometimes when you turn on the treadmill, it starts to lift the belt all the way to the highest incline setting and then goes down itself, so you have to wait until it goes back to its original position. My husband and I don't mind it BUT it does happen and it shouldn't.The treadmill works well so far, I will make an updated review in a few months from now.

  Just put together NordicTrack Treadmill. After removing plastic cover from console, noticed grooved cosmetic blemish/abrasion on plastic at lower part of console down lower half of ""incline"" and over to ""start"" buttons. This will aggravate me daily, as is ""in my face"". Because grooved blemish seems to have been smoothed over and has no jagged edges, appears product left NordicTrack with knowledge of the cosmetic defect--causing me to think it's a normal business practice to send products that have ""cosmetic defects"" out the door to customers who are expecting an unblemished, new product s/he paid for. Disappointing. Have requested NordicTrack send out new, unblemished, console. About to lodge formal complaint to Amazon, too.

  It is a great treadmill with wide running surface and very quiet motor and soft impact - easy on the legs and joints.  Operation is very straightforward.  Auto incline works perfectly while you are running - has a little loud click when you initially set the incline but works smoothly after.  The pulse rate fluctuates inaccurately, and highly sensitive to where you place your hands.  It is a very heavy treadmill and not easy to move.  Assembly requires 2 people and has many moving parts to connect.  After starting, I hired pros from Amazon's resources to finish the job.  They were great, and completed the assembly in about 80 minutes.

  Living in a rural city it was a little difficult finding someone who could assemble the treadmill, my husband suggested calling a mover, they came and not only moved it to where I wanted it but also assembled it.  I use it every morning to work out, it's a lot better than the stair stepper I was using for a couple of years, higher heart rate, better workout in less time.  What can I say, I love it.After I finally found the programed workouts, I wanted to add to this review.  The workouts are great a different place every morning, however, they only run for around 52 minutes and I like to workout for an hour, so after 52 minutes I have to restart it to finish my workout and get the full hour I need.  If I could figure out how to program them so they would last a minimum of 1 hour I would put this back to a 5 star, for now I'm only rating it 4 stars.  Love it though.

  The treadmill arrived today.  I am about an hour and a half into assembling trying to figure out the directions.  I am finding parts that don't fit and a non-existent customer service for assembly help.  I am a mechanical person but find the instructions, yes I did read the instructions, difficult.  Based on the part fit and customer service being lacking I would buy from somewhere else.  This Nordic Trac isn't what they used to be.Well, it's together and works fine.  I followed the other comments to not subscribe to iFit and it runs with no problem.

  Assembly was not hard. Though having experience putting a treadmill together prior was helpful.  The shipper was great, I had paid for in house delivery.  Just arrived yesterday.  The only issue I am having thus far is when I purchased it,  it was suppose to include one year of ifit and also i purchased a two year warranty.  I finished registering with NordicTrack and when I went to activate the ifit it doesn't seem to recognize the one year membership.  Though this may be my lack of knowledge with how these things work.  Plan on contacting today and do more research.  I am sure I can get this resolved.

  I decided to leave only one star as this treadmill was not easy to put together. One of the tools it calls for you to use is an adjustable wrench and we had a hard time getting the specific bolts tightened as the holes didnât line up great. Also, it recommends two people when putting this item together. I would say itâs not recommended but a necessity for two people to assemble this item. I would recommend if available paying the extra and having onsite assembly and save yourself the headache of putting this thing together. You will be glad you saved at least 3-4 hours of your time!

  Great treadmill so far, weâve had it a little over a month. We were weary of buying a Nordic Track because they make it seem like you have to purchase a monthly iFit plan, but you donât. The treadmill will still work without purchasing a monthly plan- just bypass this by holding down the iFit button for thirty seconds when you turn it on for the first time. It was easy to assembly but it does require 2 people.

    Unreliable quality and terrible customer service
  
",1.0,LOKyrandia,"Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  The treadmill worked ok a bit over 10 months (look, right before warranty expires), then the front puller started to produce some metal abrasive noise. Submitted a maintenance ticket to them. Apparently NordicTrack outsourced all their customer/maintenance services to ICON fitness and, well, the ICON service is TERRIBLE! (It's so terrible that I am willing to repeat it another 3 times: TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE! TERRIBLE!) The maintenance ticket was completely ignored for about 3 weeks. Then I finally had to follow up since my warranty was about to expire. Their phone call never worked. You get different phone numbers from different places (NordicTrack website, ICON website, maintenance ticket email), and none of them work. The automatic phone system just hold you for 30 minutes and hangs up. I had to contact them with online chat. Thanks god at least that worked after a 30 minutes wait, and there was one good (and the only time they were good) representative who helped me troubleshoot and ordered the replacement part. Then it was another 3 weeks of wait and I still don't have my part delivered. No correspondence at all in the mean time. I went to their website and entered my order number for tracking; the response was empty (404 not found). I had to go for online chat again to check the order status (with another 20 minutes wait), and after hearing my question the representative just said ""your warranty expired so talk to another department with phone nuwber xxx-xxx-xxxx"" and immediately cut my chat session (of course it expired thanks to the long wait!). I had to reconnect and said the order was made when I was covered under warranty, so he checked the order number and told me it's ""in process"". I asked about the problem on the website for order status checking, and he said ""I don't know why it does not work for you"" and cut the chat session again. Very awful experience chatting with this guy.My take: the product is probably worth the price if you can get it fixed to make up for its unreliability. But with the terrible service, I would strongly recommend against buying it because the likelihood of you either end up with an unusable treadmill or have to go through a terrible customer service is quite non-trivial.

I love that I have two profiles on IFit so my husband and I can both keep track of our own progress.  The instructions can be a little tough to follow at some points, but I put it together alone as a small woman.  It was pretty easy but a bit heavy, as to be expected.  The screen is clear, the belt doesnât skip while I run, and it feels more expensive than it was.  Itâs a great treadmill which seems more expensive than it was.

Don't let your building buddy drop the panel on your head. 4. If you can't find the ground wire attachment, they pushed it up inside the panel area. Fish it out. 4. If you hold down the Ifit button for 10 seconds, you can bypass it. I love Ifit. I love the treadmill until the trainer makes you run at 7.5 for sprints....

I ended up having to put it together myself which was actually pretty easy for me to do alone, EXCEPT there is one part that absolutely requires 2 people, so make sure you have another person around when putting it together.Two complaints :1. never figured out how to use the heart rate handles, but I wear a separate monitor so doesnât bother me.2. The built in fan is useless for short people. Iâm 5â3 and canât feel it the way it is angled, which you canât adjust. Also, where I put my tablet covers it anyway, so no big loss for me. I just use other, more powerful fans around the treadmill.

No, they ended up sending me a part in the mail and expected me to fix it. Then about a month later I was running and it just stopped working! So I called Nordic track again and after disassembling it while on the phone they said ok we will send you another part and I asked if I would have to fix it again by myself and they said no we can send a tech out. Imagine if I never asked, which I didnât the first time! So now I have to wait 7-10 business days for a tech to call me then we will set an appointment.

After a week I found someone who could help me, though it was difficult with double masks worn to keep us both safe.  Many of the screws are difficult to get in because of the location and the angles.  It took the two of us (my friend is a handyman, so it should have been easy) over two hours after I had spent at least an hour getting the initial steps out of the way.  The location of the serial number is obscure before you have the entire unit assembled and can raise the treadmill easily.

",1.0,James Hatton,"Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  Based solely on the assembly experience, I would recommend no one expect to assemble this themselves.  We encountered every possible problem.  Some screws the wrong size for the holes.  Openings were misaligned.  Several bolt sites were inaccessible, making it impossible to use ratchet sets or even conventional channel locks.  We had to leave out two screws altogether in the plastic holders alongside the display panel because there were no pilot holes in the receiving surface.  Worst of all, one of the bolt holes was blocked by a metal spur so that we had to ream out the hole using a homemade tool.  All of this took more than three hours and required us to devise makeshift tools to accomplish the assembly.  This item might prove to be functionally excellent, but it was extremely poorly engineered and shoddily manufactured.  We would never buy it again.  So why did we keep it?  Because there was no feasible way to return a 200+-pound item.

  I am very upset at this product. Not only did it took nearly 3 hours to assemble (the parts wouldn't fit well and it was very confusing), but the machine doesn't work. So mad! I did the iFit membership, entered my login, connected to WiFi, then the screen just kept loading without going anywhere. Also, the conveyor belt isn't working. We tried to start the machine but nothing worked. Only the incline worked.We are so pissed we spent a fortune on this, hours assembling it, and it's still not working. It's such a hassle getting everything fixed... I'm chatting with a support tech right now with no end in sight. I would avoid buying this!!!  NordicTrack needs to rethink their product strategy and how so many customers have been complaining. They are probably wasting tons of $ and resources trying to fix customers issues.

  The treadmill itself seems like it should work fine, though I've yet to put it together.  The box was pretty heavily damaged when I received it. I opened it to find that the plastic rail down one side of the track was completely broken. The end piece on the same side was broken as well.  These look to be decorative and shouldn't affect the usability of the treadmill. I will be attempting to contact NordicTrack to see if I can get replacement parts.  I might've caught it at delivery if the delivery company hadn't dropped it off on a different day than was scheduled.

My husband and I had very little trouble putting it together.  The assembling of the wires from the control panel to the rest of the unit was a challenge not to pinch the wires but we took our time and it finally came together.  We have only use the treadmill for walking (no running) and it works great.  The speed and incline buttons are easy to use and very responsive.

  I really like that the incline is very smooth as it goes up and down during your workout. I REALLY love the iFit option, and use with with every workout. The trainer is able to control your treadmill during the workout to match what they do, but you can always change it manually. Overall, I think it was a good choice for me and I recommend it.  I DO wish it would be able to fold a little smaller, but no idea how they would do that. Also, the heartbeat monitor doesn't seem to work too well, but this was not a big deal to me as I use a wrist heartbeat tracker.

  I would give this 5 stars if they didn't try to trick you into signing up for an IFIT account. All the documentation says IN HUGE LETTERS that you have to sign up to unlock your new treadmill. NOT TRUE!!! After assembly just hold IFIT button down for 30 seconds to bypass this scam! Make sure treadmill safety key is in place or it won't work. Also, there are LOTS of tutorials on YOUTUBE that show you how this works. Otherwise a good machine, but lose the scam and let people sign up if they want...don't try and trick the into it!

  I got this last year in October and am using this very frequently since. This is a great treadmill for the price and absolutely worth the money for home workouts. The only thing I don't really like is the speaker output. It's very crappy and I can barely hear music when the treadmill is in use. Treadmill itself isn't too noisy, just the speaker output is bad.

The incline is comfortable and the front and side rails are nicely located (I've used treadmills that are difficult to comfortably hold onto). It's louder than I hoped and doesn't fold like I thought so it takes more space than I wanted. I didn't like that I had to register with the app (side note I didn't have to enter a CC for the ""after the free trial"") but I don't plan on using the videos available.

This screw was meant to lay flush and hold two pieces together. Instead thereâs an ugly flappy plastic piece. Overall very frustrating for a piece of equipment that cost $1,000+.

  The treadmill took some time to assemble but it's not ridiculously hard. Toward the end of assembling, it does help if you have one person to help you with attaching the monitor/controls and the folding mechanism. The free year of ifit is a great benefit and really is a $300+ value for a family membership. It makes exercising a lot more fun and interesting. I also like the larger screen size on this model. My friend has the previous model and the screen size on this model really makes a difference especially when using ifit.

  We have had this treadmill for 4 months now and we really like it. The box came pretty banged up but there wasn't anything wrong with any of the parts. A few days after we set it up and started using it, we noticed a loud squeak whenever it was stepped on, we contacted Nordic Track and their support team walked us through what could possibly be wrong. Turned out it was just a loose screw by the motor - an easy fix- but they were very nice and helpful as we tried to troubleshoot the problem.My wife uses this treadmill about every other day during our kids' nap time. She really likes it. It's pretty quiet for a treadmill and the ledge under the display screen is perfect for holding a phone or an iPad.Overall, if you're looking for something to run on during the winter months and don't want to spend an arm and a leg, this is a great purchase!

  This is the best pandemic purchase ever!!!!! I am so happy with my treadmill and LOVE IFit!  It's amazing!  The only thing I don't like, why I didn't give it 5 stars, was the screen takes several minutes to turn on and get to the workouts.  It's VERY slow.  Although, I still need to register the machine and could probably call the manufacturer to see if it needs a new one or if I'm doing something wrong.  Pretty minor overall.Ps.  If you're debating over the 5 inch or 10 inch screen, like I did, go with the 10 inch!!!! I can't imagine how tiny the IFit training workouts would look like on a little screen.  You WANT big.

  I purchased this treadmill about a year ago and have been fairly happy with it, aside from two major issues.NordicTrack ships this unit in an unusable 'locked' state.  They will not unlock it until you sign up for a trial of their $15/mo iFit service.  If you forget to cancel within 30 days, they will bill the next year in full ($180) to your credit card.The treadmill worked properly for 9 months then stopped running.  Still under warranty, NordicTrack replaced the control board, but they took approximately 3 months to do so.Given the forced sale of their iFit product and the failure of the unit within the first year, I can't give this product more than two stars.

  Pain to assemble, but the instructions are actually quite good and all the bits and bobs you need are nicely packaged and labeled with the number of the step to use them at. I liked the organization. Follow the instructions exactly i.e. donât tighten bolts until the instructions tell you to. For example, if you tighten the bolts at the bottom of the right and left uprights â which are the first things you put on â  it becomes impossible to attach the pulse crossbar later! So you have to go back and loosen the bolts so the upright poles are loose enough to wiggle back and forth and attach the crossbar to.All the complaints about the iFit âscamâ are valid â it is quite misleading; but if you call the customer service number, a recorded message tells you to hold down the iFit key for 30 secs. If you go to iFit.com/activate, you can enter a garbage name and email, skip the credit card, then on the next screen they tell you to download an app â ignore that â just scroll down to the small print where they give you an option to activate without an app â click that. THEN they FINALLY tell you how to hold down the iFit button for 30 secs. Sheesh!However the most important thing â donât forget to attach the red magnetic key before trying to activate the treadmill, otherwise it simply doesnât start! The activation instructions on the secret web page do mention the key, but the printed assembly instructions donât. It is obvious, but oops, I didnât attach in the key and the darn thing simply wouldnât activate. Glad I finally realized it before losing my mind!Itâs a decent treadmill overall. My kids love it too. Itâs fun to run on â I feel like Iâm at the gym.

",1.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  In multiple places when you open the box this treadmill tells you that you need to register the product online to use it. Initially I was okay with this thinking that it was a warranty thing or something. However, this means giving your credit card information to a secondary site and agreeing to a subscription service which you will then have to cancel. Or not as they surely hope. After further research this is apparently not true even though packaging throughout the machine tells you this multiple times. Had I known that the machine came with such predatory practices built in I would have not bought it.It is rather overly complicated to assemble and that's coming from someone that is mechanically inclined. The packaging is frustrating and there's more tape than you can imagine. Bolts are odd sizes that don't snugly fit quality wrenches and that's not confidence inspiring.It does not stand straight up when folded and the mechanism that holds it up feels flimsy.Again I cannot overstate my disappointment with the machine in the sense that it demands that you register for a paid subscription service to even be able to use the machine at all. The machine that you've spent a lot of money on. And although this is apparently a lie and there's a workaround that seems to make it worse considering the instructions DEMAND you to register. This coupled with a rather complicated assembly and so so operation gives you a disappointing product.I am very unhappy with this purchase and I will not consider a Nordictrack in the future.

  I read all the reviews and - getting past those about the fitness membership - I decided it sounded good enough to give a try. Unpacking it, my heart sank a little - it seemed kind of cheap and flimsy! We set it up per the instructions (which were a tiny bit more complicated than maybe they could have been), disabled the fitness membership (as the other reviewers recommended), and I hopped on. I couldnât believe that I was on a treadmill in my own home because it felt JUST LIKE the ones Iâm accustomed to at the gym. I got the less-expensive model, so it doesnât have the fancy display (or a fan), but the deck is solid and flexible just like those treadmills that are 3x the price. To combat the lack of fancy display I mounted an extra tv on the wall in front of it and plugged in a FireStick so I could access virtual running videos on YouTube. Many mornings I now run on Waikiki beach or the Golden Gate Bridge! Oh, and I set up a small fan in front of the treadmill to simulate those ocean breezes. This thing has been a lifesaver this winter helping me keep up the mileage when temps have been lower than ideal. Just for reference, Iâm a slightly better-than-average runner (9-ish minute miles, about 20 miles a week) - and this treadmill has been PERFECT.

  All in all, this is a great treadmill. I have zero complaints.

Unless you're specifically looking for something that this treadmill doesn't have, this treadmill is more than enough for most people.The year of free iFit is great. I thought it would be an afterthought, videos and whatnot seemed like they wouldn't be for me, but when you're actually doing a guided run/hike, it's pretty great. The treadmill automatically adjusting speed and incline based on the video is so awesome.My wife and I are probably 100+ miles in, and the treadmill is working great, zero complaints, definitely recommend.

  We purchased this product as a result of COVID-19 and being stuck at home with minimal activity. It is the perfect size, not too bulky and quality-made. What I liked most about this model is the 10 inch screen for the lower price. One thing I wish I knew prior to setting it up though, is that you need a strong internet connection for it to work. When first assembled and turned on, the screen was stuck on the iFit triangle logo. To fix the issue, perform a factory reset according to the manual. This is done by inserting a paperclip into the tiny hole at the top of the machine while another person flips the switch from off to reset. Once we did that and connected to a stronger WiFi, the product worked like GOLD!! I love the iFit feature, it keeps me entertained and inspired during my workout. Awesome treadmill.

  Most frustrating part of the purchase is having to deal with NordicTrack to get this device initialized and up and running.If I had known about having to give them personal information including a credit card just to make this machine active I certainly would have looked else where.  You have to sign up for their iFit program in order to get your treadmill to work then you you have to cancel iFit prior to your 30 day free trial.... They make it easy to sign up but MUCH MUCH MORE difficult to cancel your subscription.

  I was surprised at how easy the assembly was. I am 5'4 and put the entire machine together by myself. I recommend putting the standing bar at the bottom on first instead of waiting until the end. The machine can easily be flipped to the side to put it on. This process is just easier before putting on the arms of the machine, especially if you are doing it alone.Overall the machine is sturdy and the free membership to IFIT adds value. The screen is big and crystal clear.

    Well-built serviceable treadmill
  
",5.0,BobbysJack,"Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2019","









  
  
    
  I purchased this treadmill in July 2016 and have been using it regularly for three years.  I am a consistent runner and use this treadmill two - three times per week for most of the year. I prefer to be outside, but when I can't run outside, this treadmill does the trick. It is a sturdy, strong work horse. I run between 5.5 - 9 miles per hour for endurance, interval training and speed work (up to an hour-ish per session) and have found no issues with the machine. Changing speed and inclines is simple and quick. Set up was fairly easy but it did take two people. My husband and I assembled it ourselves, with a minimum number of bad words. No, this treadmill is not as ""soft"" as commercial versions, but it is very serviceable.  If you are looking for a well-built, workable treadmill, this one will be perfect.

  I purchased this treadmill because I'm not comfortable going to the gym anymore due to the pandemic. As a Type 1 diabetic with other health conditions that place me in the ""high risk"" category, I just can't risk it. So, I turned my third bedroom into an in-home gym with an elliptical, treadmill, and weights. This particular NordikTrack model (around $800) was steeply discounted as the newer version (around $1,200) recently came out. This is a substantial machine. Not the least bit flimsy or cheap feeling. I can't speak to the ease or difficulty of assembly as I hired someone to put it together for me, but the treadmill arrived in perfect condition (no cracks, dents, or scratches) and functions like a dream. Thanks to the reviews I read before making my purchase, I was able to bypass the iFit registration frustration others warned about. It's true; if you hold the iFit button for 30 seconds, you can bypass the iFit registration trap and immediately begin using your treadmill. Overall, I am very pleased with this purchase! This treadmill is well worth the money.

  My husband told me I was crazy to buy a treadmill. He said I would never use it. He was wrong. It gets used almost every day. (even on nice weather days, we run outside and inside). This treadmill came with the iFit membership for a year in which 5 people can be on the account and create their own file, selecting their own workouts. Training with an iFit trainer is so fun. My 12 year old is using it as well training to get his time shorter on his next real live 5K. The treadmill works well following the trainers in speed and incline. It has a 10% incline. It is easy to assemble as my 12 year old and I (a 53 year old woman) put it together ourselves. Easy to fold, but we don't really fold it because we use it so often. Getting it when I did at 40% off, free financing with Amazon credit card, and Prime delivery it was an overall win for us!

  We've had this tread for a few months now and are really happy our purchase. The machine itself is quite compact for storage purposes and very easy to fold and unfold. I prefer running outside but between really hot summers and snow in the winter, having a place to run indoors during those times is great (very much looking forward to using this winter). I particularly like the incline/speed buttons! I think as far as home compact treads go, this is one of the best options out there!

  I wasn't really sure that we would use a treadmill, but knew with the weather turning hot and humid it would be better than walking outside.  But, we use it almost every day;  especially with the Covid virus closing down our recreation centers.  Now we can walk and get our exercise while listening to music piped through the speakers or listening to the radio.  This machine seems to be holding up very well.  I had one slight problem, which will occur eventually â the belt eventually moved slightly.  One quick email and I got a prompt response with instructions on a simple fix.  I would definitely purchase a Nordic Track again if ever the need occurs.  But, this one will probably last a long time!

  We had our treadmill for over a month now and we can honestly say itâs a good machine. It was a little hard to assemble by yourself and needed two people to help lift the machine out of the box and hold up the control panel.The machine runs smoothly from slow to fast. The only issue we had is a clicking sound when you just sped up and activate the incline. But as long as we donât do both back to back, itâs fine.I use it for speed walking, hubby uses it for full on running. The delivery was simple and they came and delivered it into my room of choice for free.

    T 7.5S review after two weeks
  
",4.0,Richard Hayter,"Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was looking for a treadmill to run on as gyms were closed and to avoid people outside during these unusual times. I was expecting a decent treadmill, but my expectations have been exceeded with this treadmill.The treadmill was delivered into my garage and I assembled it in about three hours. I only needed help from my son to hold it in the folded up position as I installed the pole that keeps it up.  I did take some time making sure it was level, as my floor is not. The rear legs adjust out to adjust the rear height of the deck. The running mat did not need adjustment as it ran centered and does not slip.I'm a fairly experienced runner, and was in the middle of training for a marathon which of course is now cancelled. I'm now running about 25 miles a week on this treadmill, and about 25 outside in the course of a week. What has surprised me is how much I love iFit. There are an endless variety of instructor lead workouts as well as the ability to create your own maps anywhere in the world. It really does take the boredom out of treadmill running and by creating a schedule for the week, makes you accountable to finish them. I just completed the Boston marathon series which was broken down into five runs, each of 5-6 miles. Really enjoyable and I let iFit do the pacing and incline as it seemed just right to me.... challenging without being impossible. I also like the onboard fan - really works  well. Speakers are not great, but quite sufficient.Because of that, I wish I had spent $300 more and got the 10"" screen instead of the 7"". It would be totally worth it with the incredible iFit content.Negatives other than screen size - the HR sensors on the grip handles are woefully inaccurate, but not a big deal for me since I have my own HR monitors that sync with the treadmill. No downhill incline on this model, not something I ever thought I would have wanted, but lots of iFit workouts have downhill sections.In summary, I'm very happy with the $1099 price for this, but now wish had bought the next model up for a larger screen.

    Excellent Treadmill with a few imperfections
  
",4.0,G. Woodhill,"Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  In full transparency, I have been offered a treadmill accessory by ICON Fitness to write a positive review, however everything I am writing below is 100% authentic and accurate.The positives:This treadmill is high tech and works beautifully for everything I want to use it for. We use it in our home and it is amazing for walking and running both inclined and flat. It comes with a year of iFit membership which includes video workouts for both running and walking, and while I haven't used them yet, they are easy to access and the treadmill tracks my weight, workouts, and calories burned for all past workouts. I have even sprinted on the treadmill and it works flawlessly (and I am over 200 pounds).The 2 drawbacks to my experience with the treadmill are:1) When I first used the treadmill the belt would ""stick"" a little when I walked. After over an hour of troubleshooting on the phone I was told that the belt wasn't properly lubricated at the factory and that I would have to pay to buy their specific lubricant from NordicTrack (you are not allowed to use silicon based lubricants, which is EVERY SINGLE lubricant on the market). This seemed wrong to me. If the factory didn't properly lubricate the belt, I don't understand why I am now obligated to fix that problem by spending more money with the manufacturer. I was assured over the phone that there was no way around this and it was now my problem to fix.2) As cool as the digital screen is, there have been a small handful of times when I have turned on the treadmill and the software failed to load and I could not start the treadmill, even by pushing the manual start buttons. I was forced to shut it down and power it up again in order to get it to start. I worry about what happens if eventually the screen doesn't load and there is no way to start the treadmill. I would have been just as happy without the screen and the software, like the treadmills at the gym where you just press ""start"" and the belt starts. There is an upside to the bells and whistles, but I worry that some day there will also be a downside.That being said, the machine works beautifully and I am happy with my purchase.

  When I received this product, after assembly, I could not use ""my"" machine! For it was locked by the manufacturer. To unlock, I was instructed to go to a web site, once on the web site, I was given no choice to unlock or register, instead I was forced to enroll in an exercise program (which was advertised to be free for a month), but alas like all fly-by-night businesses they demanded my credit card number! Which I refused to do, I did not want such a valueless service. So I tried the numbers provided in the manual, and assembly instructions, also went to the internet under ""Nordictrack"" for more numbers. In one of the numbers, they told me the process to unlock the machine with out having to establish an IFIT account, that worked. All was well, until my console component had a defective finish, it worked well but looked bad. So I tried to contact Nordictrack and not IFIT for resolution of my defective product, at the end of days of fruitless attempts they all ended that in order to receive any service one has to have an IFIT account! I went back to Amazon for assistance, I can tell you that Amazon has an exceptional customer service staff, unlike the non existent Nordictrack, Amazon had difficulty getting them to contact me and wound up giving me a rebate on the machine. From here on, I will never buy another Nordictrack product, especially that now I know there is no support unless you pay for a valueless service (sure the first month free, but by the second wham you get hit because  you forgot to cancel it)

  I purchased this and scheduled a specific delivery date because i could be home, it was delivered early when no one was home leaving an expensive piece of equipment unattended for hours, fortunately it wasnât stolen. But when i arrived home the packaging was in tatters, it was clear that the moving company utilized to ship it had literally thrown it around, boards inserted for support were completely broken, and sticking out the bottom of the package. Fortunately upon inspection of the item the only damage the treadmill itself had incurred was a small crack on the bottom casing that seems to be purely cosmetic in nature.Assembling was another monster, this is a two person job. And while the instructions all call for a 3/8ths ratchet every bolt included is actually a 9/16ths so make sure to have that unusual size handy.Then you have to activate your own property through an app youâll have to download and it will keep trying to get you to sign up for their monthly service rather than actually activating the treadmill so that is a problem in and of itself.Once you get it up and running though it does work very well, and you can fold it single handed to reduce the area itâs taking up while not in use.

Incline goes to 10.0 with only point is that thereâs a crackling sound like thereâs something inside in it way.  But Iâve notice the conveyor belt is slightly off to the side.  I wasnât here during install and it never bothered me until I tried to put it on 10 incline without loud music in my ear.

I built the majority of it on my own (25 F) in about an hour but there was a few steps at the end where itâs impossible to do alone. I downloaded the IFit app which DID NOT require I input credit card information unless I wanted to sign up for a subscription. (I did not purchase a subscription) I am used to running on high end treadmills in a group fitness class and I was very impressed at the flexibility of the deck. It was soft in my knees and allowed me to run for a long period of time with NO shin/knee pain. Iâve only used it a few times and will update comment in future if needed.

  Fast shipping is a plus, the thing is huge and heavy so make sure if you have it delivered outside you have someone to help you bring it in. It took my husband several hours and a trip to the hardware store (one of the screws was the wrong type and wouldn't go in) to get it assembled. It runs well and has a good amount of space on the belt and seems pretty quite and very smooth. The second photo of our dog, he's short and long about 70lbs. Just put it together last night here's hoping we don't have anymore issues.

  We paid to have an expert assemble the treadmill for us, but it did not take them that long to put it together. The only problem we had was our treadmill was including the iFit membership but there was no information on our membership and we had to contact Nordictrack for support. They were excellent and hooked up our subscription by answering simple questions regarding our purchase through Amazon. We are loving our machine, works well, is efficient and the classes on the machine are great. I like that we can have multiple accounts so I can track my workouts separately from my husbandâs. Excellent treadmill that is not loud and works well.

  COVID-19 and the temporary closures of gyms, I was motivated to buy a treadmill.  I selected Nordic Track because of its high-quality equipment, selection of treadmills and long-standing reputation.  I was not disappointed.  I choose theT Series 6.5 Si because the Space Saver feature is perfect for me.  Now that I have my personal treadmill, I workout 4 to 5 times a week.  Whereas before I had to push myself to go to the gym 3 times a week, maybe.  When I use the Nordic Track It's running smoothly and it's reasonably quiet.  I'm happy with my purchase.

  Does what i expect it to do . . . . make me run.Only 4 stars because the machine console shakes while running.  Iâve tightened and retightened several times to see if thatâs the issue, could be an uneven garage floor.  Iâve used a level, treadmill mat, increased-decreased the leg height to ensure things are even, not sure, still shakes.  If using the console panel to hold phone, it makes it tough to watch a movie due to the shaking.  To overcome, I hang my phone from a shelf above treadmill to avoid the shake.Other than that, the machine is solid, feels good running on it.  You canât feel the shake while running, only the console shakes.  Been using it 30min a day at 7.0.  No signs of wear and tear so far.

  My sister has had her NordicTrack for years, so I thought this would be a great investment. The delivery company wouldn't bring it into the house (so don't believe the 'one threshold' claim). The box looked a bit rough, but I thought it would be packed pretty good. The installer arrived and unpacked everything. First, the motor hood was broken and keeps sliding off. He said that happens in shipping sometimes, but it shouldn't affect functionality.  The second issue would cause a problem. The upright wire was shredded. I'm notifying the company,so I'll keep you posted.Update: It's been two weeks since I was told new parts would be sent. I've heard absolutely nothing. I'd like to use this at some point...

  I purchased this treadmill during quarantine, so I wouldn't gain the quarantine 15. A big dislike, was that I did not have the option to have someone come in my home to assemble, but I understood since we were in the middle of COVID19.Be aware that in the box this weighs roughly 300 lbs, & there is ZERO way 2 women could lift & put in the house unless they're bodybuilders.I had to have my brother & his friends lift & put in the house, & it took 6 HOURS to assemble.The treadmill itself is really great quality, & i use it almost daily. But if you purchase this, opt for delivery & assembly. It was a nightmare to put it together.Also, the iFit membership is amazing. I honestly wouldn't use the treadmill without it. It's definitely worth the cost of membership, although the membership is complimentary the first year. :)

  I shopped for some time and finally landed on this treadmill.  I was a bit nervous given the great price - concerned it might be constructed cheaply.  That's not the case! It's built well and super sound - I run on it almost daily with no squeeks, wobbles or issues whatsoever.  It also comes with a 1-month iFit membership, which I expected to disregard.  However, after using a couple of times I actually signed up for a 1-year subscription.  It's a terrific value and has helped me work out more effectively and ultimately ensure results.  In short, this is one of the great values for a reliable, easy-to-assemble treadmill that you'll find anywhere.  Further, for a few extra bucks they delivered it to my workout room in my basement - best investment I ever made!  It's heavy!

  Delivery went smoothly. My husband and I assembled it in about an hour. It feels sturdy and the incline moves up and down smoothly. The speakers sound fine but Iâve been just proping my phone up on the ledge to watch tv with headphones. It seems like that this machine was at the perfect price point - nice enough where it feels solid and comfortable but not so expensive that it has all these features I donât really need. This price also got us a machine that is a bit longer and wider so my 6â2â husband feels comfortable walking without feeling like heâs going to fall off the end. Would definitely recommend.

  Purchased this a month ago and love it!I used to go to the gym daily, but due to Covid, I haven't been back since February. I started to run and walk outside, but the concrete was starting to do a number on me. I'm still not ready to venture back to the gym to use their treadmills, so I decided to get something for home.I did a lot of research on treadmills and finally decided that this was the one.NordicTrack is a name you can trust and they make a very sound and quality product. This unit also has a very impressive manufactures warranty. This treadmill is great for the price, especially if you compare the features to other treadmills in this price range and below.Lower price treadmills had two features that turned me off. First, was the width of the belt. Seems that lower priced treadmills had a 16"" wide belt or less. That made me concernned that my arms were going to hit the support bars. This treadmill has a 20"" wide belt with plenty of room to feel comfortable with either running or walking. The other issue that cheaper treadmills had were that their incline levels were manual. So before you ran, you had to physically lift the treadmill up and adjust the incline, which were usually 3 levels, and those levels did not provide an adequate incline. This treadmill has an electric generated incline with 10 levels and that is a far better option. It also has 10 speeds, which at this price level, is pretty impressive.Assembly took over three hours. There are videos on YouTube that help walk you through the process and are very helpful. Some of the screws did not fit, but eventually got them to fit. I assembled this by myself. Having two people helps, but you can do it with one person. Worst part was the very last part installing the hydraulic arm. Just use a chair to hold up the belt and rollers and you should be fine.Make sure you maintenance the belt and rollers with silicon, which can be found for purchase on Amazon. The more you use it, the more friction is going to affect the belt. Needs to be lubricated every few months. Not expensive.Only complaint is the display is a bit bright and bare bones. And like most people havd said,the subscrition to iFit seems fishy, but that can easily be bipassed by holding the iFit button for 10 seconds.Are the treadmills at the gym better? Yes, but they also cost thousands of dollars. And this treadmill does not feel cheap or inferior to those you would find at a gym. While running, its almost impossible to tell the difference. If you miss the feeling of running or walking on treadmills at the gym, this is what you need.I would definitely recommend buying this. No regrets, except wish I would have purchased it sooner.

  The set up drives me insane! I just want to get on the flipping treadmill and run. You have to wait forever for the screen to load and then it doesnât pick up the internet and then you have to continue without wifi. The actual treadmill, once you finally get it to where you can keep track of the laps and the time, isnât so terrible physically.  I think Iâve discovered I would rather have something simple. Iâve caught myself wanting to punch the screen a couple of times because I canât believe Iâve made this purchase. I would not suggest buying this if you just want to hop on and go because believe me you will get tired of it quickly. The loading process is just terrible. If you have to have the fancy screen which sucks and you want to attempt for the wifi to pick up then sure.

  I bought the treadmill shortly after the Covid-19 caused my gym to close. It arrived in the time stated.

I curse it every time I walk by it but I get up at 5 a.m. every damn day to do my walking. It has performed flawlessly and changes speed, incline etc. Without a hitch! Buyer beware: You DO NOT need to subscribe to the ifit BS. Read reviews to find the work around to that crap. All in all, very, very pleased with the treadmill even though I curse it regularly!

I use the incline function quite a bit and really appreciate the quality of this unit versus other ""home"" treadmills I've seen. I'm not into all the extra stuff it comes with for digitally linking accounts to a phone app etc., so I can't provide feedback on that interface, but I can attest that the unit itself is structurally sound and of high quality!

  Assemble - it was a little difficult to align the holes with the screws and to tighten it up.Folding - it is easy to fold up but tricky to unfold because of the area where you need to âstepâ on to release.We have this treadmill in front of our sliding door looking outdoors. Being it Atlanta, the weather can get too hot and pollen count high. The incline and speed is like your ânormalâ treadmill at the gym.We decided to do the iFit subscription and the synchronization from the app to the treadmill is great. I would recommend this subscription along with the product to enhance your workout.

  I did a lot of research before I selected this treadmill. I didn't want to spend a lot, but wanted a treadmill with at least a 20"" X 50"" walking/running surface. This one works well for me with a 20"" X 55"" surface.The treadmill arrived quickly but had several broken plastic pieces (side rail and associated parts, parts of the motor hood, and the base under the motor/belt drive). This is a very heavy item, but I think the packaging could be improved to help prevent damage on the sides and corners, which is where most of the damage to my treadmill occurred.I was able to order the broken parts within and hour and a half of delivery. It took 30-45 minutes to get the Icon Fitness customer service rep on the phone but once I did she was courteous and very helpful. The parts were delivered free.I assembled as much of the treadmill as I could while waiting on the replacement parts. The assembly instructions were very good and I only needed assistance with another person when installing the lift assist cylinder. It took me no more than an hour and a half to assemble. I like that the parts/screws/hardware was packaged with their part numbers and corresponded to the assembly steps in the instructions.My replacement parts arrived in three separate shipments which ultimately took a month to get all of them. I was able to begin using the treadmill after the second shipment of parts arrived.Startup was easy with the hints given by others to bypass Ifit.I have the 5 inch screen and it is perfectly fine. There are 20 workouts (5 each for calorie, intensity, incline, and speed). The speed and incline are controlled by the treadmill during the workout but you can override them to suit you or just make all settings in a manual mode. The incline is working well and can really make you work harder during your workout.I wish the warranty were a bit better on the motor which is why I did not give the treadmill 5 stars. There are other similarly priced treadmills with better motor warranties.But overall I think this is a very nice treadmill. I was able to get it at a very good price. If you ae considering it I suggest checking the price on Amazon each day and waiting for a sale.

  The treadmill is amazing! But one thing you should know is that if you plan on using it with bluetooth headphones(completely wireless) you won't be able to. I have the jabra elite 65t active and I bought them just to use them while I workout. But when I use them on this treadmill, it interferes with my headphones and I just hear static the whole time. I found out it does it with almost all types of bluetooth headphones that are completely wireless. So that's something to keep in mind, wired headphones work fine, but completely wireless will mess your ears up and won't be able to hear your music comfortably. Also, keep the pulse reader clean, it seems to be some cheap metal that gets rusty fast. The speakers on the treadmill are bad, don't even think about using them for music. Lol. Other than that The machine is amazing though, highly recommend it.

The treadmill never functioned properly and was even scuffed up (plastic motor cover) like it was a refurbished product though I bought brand new. The belt skipped so bad my husband almost hurt himself attempting to run on it. Icon fitness refused to send a replacement machine and only offered fixes like âletâs try having you lube it.â They finally agreed to replace a part after my second or third call on hold for hours. The part never arrived. When I talked with a rep I was told the past was in âquality control.âThankfully, Amazon customer service was awesome and agreed to take the treadmill back despite being past their return policy.I donât know why this piece of junk is Amazons top pick, but Iâd imagine it has more to do with a contract then people actually rating this treadmill 5 stars.Do not buy this treadmill.

  This is a nice treadmill.  It is basic with no bells and whistles.  It is not blue tooth compatible unless you buy the Ifit plan, but that is not a big deal for us.  There is no fan, which is also not a big deal for us.  We chose to pay to have it assembled and the assembly team arrived timely and were very nice.  They didn't try to sell us on the Ifit plan, they simply told us to hold the Ifit button down for 30 seconds and the treadmill would work.  We have used it a lot and we like the 20"" belt as opposed to a smaller one.  Very satisfied with the treadmill.

  3 STARS for misleading packaging disclaimers re: iFit. Treadmill arrived today, assembly instructions well written, straightforward. No real time spent on it yet, so cannot attest to overall quality (will review after time), but seems very solid for an entry level treadmill from a reputable company. THAT BEING SAID: There are MULTIPLE disclaimers on packaging indicating unit will NOT function until you register/sign up for an iFit plan. THIS IS MISLEADING/FALSE. TO BYPASS: Once assembled, power on unit>HOLD iFit logo on front panel DOWN for appx. 20-30 sec. This bypasses any need to register unnecessarily, and unit will function as intended. Again, the packaging would lead you to believe you MUST register with iFit. This is misleading and incorrect. Unusual that NordicTrack, a company with a very solid reputation would do this without informing consumer.

  This treadmill is a fine purchase. Donât bother paying for additional shipping options. We paid to have it delivered to the room of our choice and got it left at our door. Amazon would not refund our money. That aside the machine does the trick. Not a lot of bells and whistles but provides a smooth run. Iâve had it up past 9mph with no problems. We also bypassed the iFit program by calling the number on the treadmill and saying we didnât have internet access. My only complaint is that once you center the belt it moves with use and becomes off center. You just have to adjust it every so often, not terrible. Overall, pleased with the purchase. Does the trick when the weather is bad and I donât want to run outside.

  I got my treadmill in about 2 weeks before I broke my hand. Thankfully it is so easy to fold that i can do that with 1 hand! As for ifit, I have never found a program that makes me so engaged as the ifit app does. I don't even care to try to figure out how to use the machine without the app because there are so many places to explore and so many talented and knowledgeable trainers that keep me 100% engaged. I love being able to do a work out and then get so wrapped up in learning about the geology, history, and views of foreign countries and cities that all of a sudden the work out is done! I am currently doing the Iberian Beginner Running Series with Tommy Rivers Puzey and i can't recommend his program enough!The machine is nice and stable and I have had very minimal glitches with it. Mostly, it occasionally doesn't want to start the video right away and I have to close the app and reopen it. NBD.Very satisfied, very much worth the price.

  For the amount spent on this treadmill I feel like their should be a little more into it. It was heavy and a little annoying to put together as expected but the plastic and some parts feel too flexible/ flimsy youâd think it would be strong heavy duty plastic. Although once together it feels a little more sturdy. I really wish it was a little more tech advanced like with Bluetooth enable and able to have apps like YouTube. Itâs a little loud too while warm up walking but once running itâs not too annoying. I really like this treadmill but I think they over priced it a couple hundred.

    Great Sturdy Treadmill Is Easy To Assemble/Store/Use
  
",5.0,Jesse Ramirez III,"Reviewed in the United States November 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was looking for a treadmill that I would actually use not just as a clothes hanger, and I quickly realized the cheaper options were not going to cut it. I came across this model, and the description sounded perfect to me. Wide belt, automatic incline, easy assembly, free delivery, and hydraulic-assisted unfolding! The motor is quiet, and powerful enough for my needs (speed 6/10:00 miles), although I can take it up to speed 10. Customer service is great, as I already used them soon after my delivery. The hood cover broke during shipment/storage, and I called to see about a replacement. Both Amazon and Nordic Track were on top of it, and they shipped out a cover within a few days free of charge. One complaint is the display is a little hard to read if the lights are not bright enough. Sure you can read the time and distance, but if you want to change speed or incline, I have to really look hard. The other complaint is that with this kind of money spent on a treadmill, they couldn't even add a charging port for my phone. SMH. Great treadmill otherwise. Would buy it again.

    Assembly and set up issues
  
",3.0,Nasim Kholusi,"Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  Iâm giving this three stars due to several factors.One of the screws included in the assembly packet was a defective screw. Once the product was assembled it was still not very sturdy and it also was not level.  The process to get the machine activated and to use it without iFit is a headache.I wouldnât reccomend it but if you do go with this treadmill be sure to pay the extra for expert assembly to save you the headache. Also be aware of the hoops you have to jump through to activate and then deactivate iFit if you are not interested in a monthly premium workout program.

  Just got this machine yesterday. Assembly was relatively easy, and the machine itself runs smoothly. The major issue is with start up. Nordictrack wants you to sign up for its ifit service, which is $15 a month. My wife used it first and the treadmill easily paired to her phone. She was able to start up the machine and take off after just a few minutes. I went next and had a completely different experience. I downloaded the same app, but my screen looked completely different than hers. I also wasnât able to pair until my wife disconnected from it first. Even paired to the machine I could not get it to start.I went online to try and troubleshoot and Nordictrackâs website which indicated that something Was wrong with equipment and needed to replaced. Fortunately, my wife found on a review that if you hold down the ifit button for 20 secs the ifit system eventually shuts off. This is indicated by the light turning from blue to green. Once that happens the machine works exactly as it should.

  I've been a runner for 10+ year but I admit that running in high hear, bitter cold or heavy cold rain is not my thing. I was looking for a treadmill that won't break my budget and helps me keep going. A friend got this one and highly recommended it so I bought it. Best decision ever. My significant other installed it in an afternoon. We have been using it for the last 3 months regularly. He's mostly power-walking but I'm running, hiking, you name it. The IFit app keeps me entertained and gives me the opportunity to virtually travel to places where I only dream to go while I train. Highly recommended.

  It has been about 2 months since I've been using this nordictrack treadmill, so far so good. I like the folding technique as it is fairly easy to store when not in use. It runs smoothly and the incline is a nice touch. The only downfall would be the set-up process. It took me a couple of hours to setup but if I had someone else helping me it would of taken less time. Overall, a pretty nice product.

  Our brand new treadmill arrived with a bent frame. We didn't realize this until the treadmill was assembled and the base was off-center by several inches. We have contacted Nordicktrak and are supposedly going to be contacted by a technician to repair our brand new treadmill. It has been over a week. If it wasn't so large and already assembled, it would have been returned. I can't blame Nordicktrak. It was probably damaged in shipment. They do have our money, and I am still walking outside.

  While the treadmill is nice, the iFit application almost ruins it and their customer service doubles down. Cant even activate your treadmill unless you go through iFit for whatever reason which was an aggravating process in itself then be prepared for multiple emails a day. When simply asking to unsubscribe to the emails, I was informed they had to delete my whole account thus removing me from the free month. Then chat closed. iFit is a horrible experience.The Treadmill itself is pretty nice and gets the job done however. Its a shame they are linked with a company like iFit

  Do not order a NordicTrack unless you are prepared to do all the work on it yourself.  My belt wasn't adjusted properly on install.  I bought a 3 year maintenance plan that says it covers in-house work.  But they will refuse to honor that.  You are on your own.  One day you are going to have to change the belt.  You have to disassemble the whole Treadmill to do this.If you are an expert Treadmill technician then go for it.  Otherwise do not purchase a NordicTrack.

    A COMPLETE pain to put together
  
",3.0,Miko Spencer,"Reviewed in the United States May 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  An extreme hassle to put together, takes way longer than expected and not too many of the pieces/holes actually line up. Not all the told are included. Instructions get a little iffy. DO NOT toss any of the screws they tell you too until you are completely finished. (You will be asked to reuse some of them later on, I always keep mine just in case). Theres an additional wire on the base part of the treadmill and the screen that is not listed anywhere in the instructions or online. Do we connect this? Or not? Also weighs 250 pounds so I'd pay someone to deliver it and bring it in. Will take two people to put together (someone you trust and can politely feud with over the idiotic design of how to put this together). Not everything is tight and not all screws will go in. I would start with step 16/17 first as it has to do with the bottom on the treadmill. They want you to put the entire thing together AND THEN put the bar in on the bottom that holds it upright for its store away design. Don't be fooled, someone will have to manually hold it up as someone fenagles the putting together of the bar set up. It isn't fun. It's heavy and arduous.

",3.0,Branches,"Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased this treadmill to use during the winter months, given that gyms are closed. The treadmill is great when it works. Unfortunately, the treadmill console stopped working about 35 days after receiving it (just in time to not be able to return it). Nordic track customer service was unable to help and directed to me to a third party called ifit who determined I probably needed an entirely new console. The console will take 2-3 weeks to get here, and they did not guarantee it will work. The treadmill will not turn on at all. This means that after 35 days of owning a treadmill which I used maybe 10 times, I already cannot use the treadmill. Will update if there is any improvement with new console.

  So far, so good. Runs smooth and relatively quiet. We use it mainly for walking, but it also provides adequate performance for moderate running. Please note that it is a HEAVY piece of gear, and requires two people to lift, assemble, and/or move from one location to another. Youâll need quite a bit of clearance and space to store this away between uses. Otherwise, expect to add it to your home as a permanent piece of furniture.

  The assembly was a pain. When I got to the upper part of the treadmill the pulse bar would not align with the uprights. Little did I know that they added two right handle bars - instead of left and right handle bar. I would not understand why things were not aligned. I tried hard to make it match but it was impossible. After 1 hour of trying to align everything, I found out that is was a part error and I was given two identical handle bars. I had two cheap proform treadmills over 10 years. with no problems. I upgraded to a better brand, just two find out that Nordic Track does not know how to include the correct parts for their treadmills in the factory. Very Disappointing!!!! I called support but they don't work on Saturdays, of course! Stay clear of this sloppy company.

    Great Treadmill Despite Some Cheap Plastic
  
",5.0,Mike Helm,"Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2021","









  
  
    
  First off, pricing on this treadmill was a great deal. I have rated it 5 stars as 4.5 is not possible. I love how easy it is to fold up and drop down. I also put a lot of pressure on the locking strut without lifting the base any further to test how it would hold up if it was accidentally bumped; it didn't budge. You actually have to push the base up a little more to disengage the lock.Assembly was fairly straightforward and the instructions were very detailed. I marked it 4 stars under assembly as the box was not holding together very well once delivered and some of the plastic pieces are cheap/fragile. Navigating downstairs with a heavy treadmill no longer in its box proved difficult. The plastic cover for the motor incurred a little damage to 2 of the 5 internal screw hole locations. Luckily the nuts used are the little metal clips that are slid on. There was still about half the plastic for them to hold onto, so I was able to put the cover back on with no visible damage or issues. Other people may not be so lucky. So be careful with the plastic parts if you are assembling this yourself.As for actually using the treadmill, it is great. The incline action was a little louder than my wife expected, but doesn't bother you once you are listening to music. The speed adjusts quickly and we love the quick select options to adjust the speed even more quickly. Great for manual interval ""sprints"". If you want to bypass the iFit on this particular model, be sure the emergency cord is attached and then just hold down the iFit button for like 10-30 seconds.I highly recommend this treadmill for others than want quality without all the unnecessary bells and whistles of some others.

  Took a while to receive but fully met my expectations!  Only problem was that it came locked and the instructions stated the only way to unlock it was sign up for iFIT program which requires a credit card and includes automatic monthly renewal unless canceled by purchaser.  Fortunately I read reviews which explained how to bypass that by pressing the hidden switch underneath the iFIT logo.  Now works like a charm without the hassle of canceling the iFIT program or paying a monthly fee.

",1.0,Daniel,"Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  The treadmill comes preloaded with iFit (an ICON brand) which is effectively subscription ransomware. NordicTrack (another ICON brand) tries its best to make you think that you need to sign up for an iFit subscription before you can even use the treadmill. Luckily, other reviews on here pointed out you can hold the iFit button down for 30 seconds to clear the system and actually use it. I feel like I should make a trip to 1500 S 1000 W Logan, UT to have a little chat with them face-to-face. Regardless, I'll never buy anything associated with ICON ever again.

  Free 12 month iFit membership was what helped sell me on this product. So I bought it. Delivery came with a promo card for the 12-month membership. The promo card was declined as ineligible on the iFit website. I've reached out to Amazon and the manufacturer to fix this, and I've received nothing but triangulation and passing me to the other entity. Shouldn't be my job to fix this problem. I paid $1K for this, and now I'm spending my spare time trying to fix their problem. Figure it out or don't offer the service. Will likely return unless I get some help from someone soon.

  We are thrilled with our Nordic Track purchase! It was a big purchase for us and we've been thinking about for a few years. We are so glad we finally did it.I love the interactivity with iFit, the videos and trainers are a blast. I especially love being able to walk and see places all over the world when it is bitterly cold and cloudy outside here. Getting it into the house was a trick, and getting back where we needed it required some ingenuity, but it wasn't too hard. Make sure you get the delivery people to get it inside your door. We then opened the box and took the pieces to the room we wanted.We saw comments about not being able to use it without iFit, but I use it on manual mode often. A member of our family is working through long term illness so sometimes they need control over speed and incline. The manual mode is ideal for that.Again, we're super happy! If you want to walk or run inside, this is a great machine!

  Home gym for two adults and one pre-teen. It's been two months now. I run daily 2-3 miles. Hubby and son walk daily 1-2 miles. Nice and steady at a fast pace (my max 7). Great incline, but not as high as others. Speakers suck but that's not what I bought it for. I was more worried about loud squeaking noises (hasn't happened yet). Display is nice. ifit was nice to have, but I don't use it enough so it's been cancelled. The built-in intervals (without ifit) are awesome!! I put it together myself, but I would recommend that you have someone around to help. I would not hire someone to do it because it's really not that difficult.

  Delivered on time. Paid extra to have it delivered to a room. Put it together by myself, I felt like not tightening screws per instructions, was the key to get parts to fit...particularly by the console. Take care to not pinch the cords. Follow the directions! Read many reviews before buying this treadmill, and this was my third choice: first was a 1600.00 Bowflex, second was a 1100.00 Nautilus, then this one. Three hundred dollars off was too good to be true and the reviews were very helpful. Bluetooth works great, fan is ok, relatively quiet. Did not use iFit and probably wonât due to the negative comments. Added maintenance plan for 2 years.Overall I am very pleased. âExercisingâ patience helped me get a good deal.

  Excellent treadmill, fairly easy to assemble with some care and time. Product is extremely heavy which tells you that it has good bones. Not very easy to maneuver especially if you don't want anything to happen to your wood floors or heaven forbid linoleum flooring. Just take your time and be patient if you have to move it. Ideally you have a second person to assist you so as to ensure no damage. Overall, product is far better than anticipated. Works very well with multiple adjustments you'd expect from a high end treadmill. Which in my opinion this is.

",5.0,Amazon user 2015_WinC,"Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  If you are looking for a relatively compact, inexpensive and functional treadmill for your home gym, this is a great choice.  We have been using it for the last three months and it has been a great experience.  We use it on average 4 to 6 times a week for about an hour each time.  Some negative reviews mention the iFitness setup after installation, there is a way to bypass the iFitness app by holding down the ""iFitâ button for longer than 30 seconds.  I learned this by reading the reviews before purchase and it worked like a charm.  If you donât take the time to do your research online and read the reviews before buying a product like a treadmill, you should not be shopping online.  The speed and incline setup is very easy and straightforward from 1 to 10.  The cup holders are big and nice for me to put down a water bottle and a towel.  When I am running on it, it is very sturdy and doesnât shake.  It is just big enough to feel comfortable on it but not too big where it fits nicely in the basement corner.  You can fold it up if you need extra space when not using it â it is very easy to fold and unfold.  Personally I donât need all other frills that come with the treadmills that cost $1500+ such as a built-in fan or TV screen.  For the price of under $700, we have been very satisfied with this treadmill.

  Everything works so far. It's not the easiest thing in the world to build (some of those bolts are difficult to get in) also, you keep in mind that you will have a HUGE box and packing materials to deal with afterwards,  but most DIY'ers should have no issue. It's solid, not too noisy, no detectable smells,. I'd say it's very near the ""feel"" of the higher end ""professional/gym"" models which is quite amazing based on the significant price savings hereThe iFit was very unpleasant to have forced upon me but luckily you can hold the ifit button to bypass/decline it. I may or may not check it out but anything that is forced upon me by a manufacturer (cough, laptops, cough) has a bad headstart.I'll be back after a while to update my review, even if it's to say how good of a coat hanger it is (hopefully not that)

  Iâd really like to rate this 3.5 stars but I suppose Iâll round up because the machine works fantastic. Product was dropped off at my house with one end of the box flapping open. Box was very damaged. Luckily I didnât have any pieces missing. Base of the machine came with a crack in it so it doesnât seamlessly close on one side of the end where the motor is stored.Putting this together will require at least two people. If you arenât already someone who has a knack for assembling, I would definitely recommend getting someone who is. I consider myself great at assembly and even this has its moments of difficulty. Have a wrench on hand for sure!Despite the initial disappointment, the machine worked fantastic. I really lucked out considering how it arrived. Inclines all the way to its level 10, very slowly but it does. Ran a little bit at a 5.5 rate and had no problems. As far as loudness, I felt that it gave off a normal treadmill level of sound? If that makes sense? Didnât bother me, and if youâre listening to music with headphones it should not be a problem anyway. Easy to navigate electronic display. Looking forward to great workouts!

I'm 6 foot and ~220 pounds and have no problems with walking/jogging, very tall people may have problems with a full sprint. The treadmill is quiet and very sturdy with a clear display.Don't expect any fancy features or for the heart rate monitor to be even moderately accurate, just buy a smart watch and tablet with your savings over the expensive treadmills.Expect assembly to be 1-2 hours and there are steps that really need 2 people.Note: Bypass ifit setup by holding ifit button for 20-30 seconds (only the first time you setup), no big deal.

  After years of contemplating buying a treadmill but always deciding it wasn't worth the money since I had access to them at the gym, I started looking seriously a few months ago after several months of COVID lockdown kept gyms out of access, and even after they opened, I was leery of going into one. I had a tough time deciding on a treadmill. I was looking at budget treadmills in the 300-400 price range but every time I read a review it said things like ""belt too narrow"", ""not sturdy enough for running"". I didn't need anything with bells & whistles like a huge display or TV or speakers or fans. So I kept raising the price range until I found one that I was able to find the qualities I was looking for. I came upon the NordicTrack T Series 6.5S, and I love it so far! I like the spacious 20âx55â tread belt running surface, I like that it is sturdy. The speeds are 1-10 and most of the time I can't even go past 5.5 to 6 for my fast jogging. The panel has plenty of options to keep track of all kinds of stuff. I only use time, or distance,  I wanted something that could be folded up. This thing is HEAVY - I had to hire someone to put it together for me. Thanks to other reviewers, I was able to figure out how to bypass the iFit registration to activate. I have had this treadmill for over 3 months now and so far I am very happy with this purchase.  My only regret is that I paid $789 for it and have since see it list for around $600/-, a price that would have made this an even greater value.

Even though it has monthly fees it does the job well of having you connected, motivated with different workout options and reasonably priced. The only reason I give a 4 star is mainly due to the fact that it makes a creeky noise during the incline walk/run. Would have been nice to have a smaller display than digital numbers. Have found models with display after the purchase for about the same price but have long lead times for delivery.

  I purchased this treadmill and opted to assemble it myself to save the 100 bucks. The assembly was difficult. The treadmill comes with certain parts screwed together for shipping purposes I guess, but they're not permanent screws. The instructions neglect to mention to remove these screws until after you've assemble a part causing you to have to un-assemble that part, remove the screw, and re-assemble it, which is annoying and wastes time. Other than that, the assembly was going okay until I realized they forgot to send me a part. It was the bar that attaches the two handles and that the console screws into, so kind of a key component. It took three weeks to get through to ICON Fitness to get my replacement part ordered. Every time I tried to get in touch, they were experiencing longer than usual wait times. Even first thing in the morning. And when I would get through to somebody, they said they couldn't help me with my issue. Finally, I thought I had the part ordered, but a week passed, and I never received a confirmation email. So, I ordered the part again. A few days later, both parts showed up. No idea why the first part took so long to ship but the second one only took a few days. Seems inconsistent. But anyway.. neither part fit! Both were too short to reach from one handlebar to the other and if even they did, the treadmill wasn't built squarely, so the screw holes on the bar were nowhere near lining up with the holes in the handle bar.  So after much frustration with reaching customer service over three weeks, I got duplicate parts and neither fit. Waste of time. I sent this treadmill back and ordered a ProForm treadmill.

  Lots of pieces to put together and very heavy in the box (partially due to some of the heavy packing material).  However, once together it works well and it a great piece of workout equipment.  I don't use all of the features like the incline and the programming for different courses, but it seems well made.  I love the built in speakers where I can plug in my phone to hear music or watch a video much easier than having to have my earbuds in. I did have to purchase a compatible cord to connect it though as it does not come with it.  I was disappointed that one of the feet was damaged during shipping, but Nordic Track replaced it at no charge and it was able to get it on with no problem. I can honestly recommend this as a great treadmill.

  Bought this as a Christmas gift for my wife. We have both been using it. It works great! Love it! The box came in good shape. All the parts were undamaged. Assembly went perfectly. All the parts, hardware etc. are good quality. Holes all lined up perfectly. No complaints! The box is quite heavy. Two people to move it for sure.If someone got a damaged treadmill or something doesn't work, I can understand a bad review. Those things aside, this treadmill is everything it claims to be. I have assembled countless things over the years...this is well made!

  We don't know how we could have coped without the Nordic Treadmill during this coronavirus pandemic. With the closings of parks and some rainy days we are able to exercise anytime on any day. We constantly talk about how ordering this treadmill was the best/luckiest thing we've done to prepare (wink-wink) for this time in our life. The treadmill has been flawless and the iFit programs have taken it to a level we never imagined. Picture (literally) you are able to world travel during this time of isolation and being able to work out at the same time. Well, that's what you getâan assemblage of super trainers to lead you through exercise routines geared to your abilities with the backdrop of some of the most beautiful locations in the world. And the trainers are so knowledgeable about the history and culture of these locales, besides the techniques and conditioning needed to achieve your health-related training goals. My wife and I have found this to be invaluable. You also have the ability to develop your own routines. There is a website where you can adjust the speed, the intervals, the incline for any timed workout you want to create. And then when you are ready to workout it miraculously shows up in your favorites on the treadmill itself. It's like magic, well not really. Your treadmill needs to be connected to your home wifi for internet connection. But that's pretty much it. The only thing you have to do is to make exercise part of your daily routine. This Nordic Track treadmill has taken exercise to a new level of enjoyment.

    Nice Product But Not All Features Work - TERRIBLE SUPPORT
  
",3.0,S. Taylor,"Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  It's a nice, basic treadmill.  That said, it promises a lot of things that it doesn't deliver.  E.g., it claims that it integrates a heart rate monitor.  When you go to the instructions to find out more, it says ""consult the front cover of this manual for details"".  There's nothing on the front cover of the manual (or anywhere) about a heart rate monitor.  And so on, and so on.Dealing with support has been a nightmare.  First jump through a million hoops, a million forms asking me irrelevant questions (so they can market to me) and then once I finally did all of that I got told that they don't handle ""software issues"" and to call some other number.  Where I waited on hold forever and gave up.I really wanted to give this 5 stars because for its price it's a nice treadmill for what it is.

  So far the treadmills excellent I'm happy with it and the delivery was so cool thank you very much.... just one other thing about assembling the treadmill you do need the special tools like the mechanics use I don't know what they're called wrenches or you could buy that and Home Depot for about maybe $20 cycle little set and and it'll be much easier instead of just using like like pliers or you know little pools that you have any in your house plus it will be a little difficult to do it on your own but I did it on my own it took me about 4 hours but if it could get done but it's better if you have someone to help you some of the parts some of the treadmill is how can I save this you just need two people to help you figure it out you know so anyways good luck out there

My husband and I did a lot of research on a treadmill that would work well in our basement without my husband having to worry about his head being too close to the ceiling on incline (heâs 6â2). This tread fits the bill without losing any performance features of a more robust tread. Weâve been using it every day for the past few months and are very happy with it!

  I had gotten my hands on a RW500 (rowing machine) from Nordic Track and loved the ease and simplicity of the unit, I decided to also get their treadmill, and I was not disappointed. We have had commercial treadmills in the past, I did not want a big bulky unit and I also wanted the metrics and the interactive w/o's from the IFIT to see how I was doing and if I was improving or not.  The unit was easy to assemble, and its small size works great. I am not a fast runner the unit can go to a speed of 10 I have only had it up to 6. I typically run with the interactive programs or in manual mode with Zwift cannot say enough on how I enjoy the units from NordicTrack (Rower and the Treadmill)

  I like it very much. I haven't used the guided programs with instructors because I can't move that fast. But I have  used it manually with some of the trails on the screen, which is nice. I had back surgery and this was to help me get back on the mend. I needed to walk and I don't do cold. Now I have to wait for my next back surgery until after the Covid-19 thing is over before that happens, so the treadmill is just patiently waiting until I can get back on there. I hope the free I-Fit membership still works by the time I am able to use it, as I never used the card yet. Otherwise I think this treadmill will be great.

  Iâm very happy with this treadmill after a month. The only thing that doesnât work well or consistently for me is the heart rate monitor. I assembled this myself and it took me a full day working on and off because I kept making mistakes and needed to take breaks for my sanity, but I persisted and felt very accomplished when I was finally done.  I wish the tread was more cushy, but for the price this is a solid treadmill and I love the 0-10% incline option.  I only walk on the treadmill and the incline gives me the workout I need without having to run.  Itâs a bigger treadmill than I expected, but true to the size specifications.  My husband travels a lot so right now itâs on his side of the bed. Lastly, I held down the iFit button for 30 seconds like other reviewers have suggested and I was then not required to pay for iFit.  I use the treadmill without the iFit.

  I was looking for a decent low-cost treadmill and was a little concerned about the mixed reviews. I'm very happy I purchased, this fits my needs perfectly. Setup was straightforward and took me about an hour to put together with help from my wife. It was very simple as long as you follow the instructions, though I'd definitely recommend assembling in the location you'll be keeping the treadmill due to the weight.Deliver was also easy, it came through a separate freight company who were communicative throughout the process about selecting a date and time and contacting me when they were about an hour out from my location on the delivery date.While other people have talked about the need to use iFit, you can bypass this, but I actually decided to try it out and have continued using since. I like the preloaded workouts offered along with the ability to create my own and it's cheaper than a gym membership. Having that extra motivation knowing I'm trying to achieve a certain distance or duration helps me to keep pushing myself.I've been using it 3 times per week for 3 months now without any issues. It has a nice range of speeds, I'm not a sprinter by any means, and generally keep my runs in the 5-6 mph range. The incline function also works well.All in all, it's a great value for the price and the build quality compared to similarly priced machines is fantastic.

  The toughest part is the assembly. You have to read instructions carefully otherwise you will end up having to unscrew it again. Once installed I tested the treadmill and of course I heared some things off but this is the just the break down part. Once it was actually used it worked fine for me. At the time I purchased it the assembly was not available until 2 months but when checked again after ordering it, it was a lot sooner but I would have liked receiving the order and paying the assembling instead of taking a couple of days to assemble it when I had time. Overall the treadmill works perfectly fine so far, no problems but customer service is really slow, almost non existent.  That is the reason why I am only providing 3 stars. Though Amazon service did try their best. It is the product service that does not respond.

    Three catastrophic failures in less than a year
  
",1.0,Joshua Merris,"Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  In less than a year this treadmill has had three catastrophic failures.After about 8 months the belt control module died.  At that point the treadmill belt no longer moved.It took 2 months to get a replacement part, which was covered by the warranty.A week or so after replacing the module, the walking deck cracked down the middle...the actual wooden deck has a foot long crack caused by 8ish months of normal use.  Keep in mind, I weigh about 150 lbs, which obviously isnât pushing the upper limit of treadmillâs weight rating.  However, the walking board was also covered under the warranty, and took another month or so to arrive.That takes us up to the year warranty that comes with the treadmill.Everything worked well for about a month, until the motor started making a clicking noise.  Softly at first but over the next week it continued to grow louder.  Additionally, the treadmill could no longer maintain speed and would jerk randomly while in motion.  Finally, it completely died.  The entire treadmill went black, everything shut off and no amount of unplugging or resetting would get it to turn on.Since it was no longer covered by the warranty, and considering in less than 1 year, I had only been able to use the treadmill for about 9 months, I abandoned it.So, I have some additional thoughts that Iâll go into below, but if you donât care about my personal opinions/experiences with Nordictrack, the above list of problems should be enough to give you pause before spending money on this treadmill.Ok, so I have some additional thoughts related to, but not specific to my series of problems.  NordicTrack customer service is a joke.  Iâve seen other reviewers mention this, but you wonât be able to talk to anyone personally.  I sat on hold for 2 hours before hanging up.  I tried calling a few other times and sat on hold for 45 minutes before giving up...the point is, it doesnât matter when you call...or how long you wait, you wonât talk to anyone.  Itâs not worth your time to try.That being said, the online customer service was fine.  They responded relatively promptly and for what itâs worth, sent me the replacement parts I needed.  I do understand it isnât personally their fault that it took 2 months for a computer part and another month for the walking deck to ship.Keeping in mind the numerous calls and being on hold for as long as Iâd want to sit and wait...never personally talking to anyone throughout the entire multipart ordeal....the single most annoying part of my entire NordicTrack experience was receiving a call from NordicTrack trying to get me to renew my warranty!  All of the sudden when they want more of my money, they have people available to call and talk.  Amazing.  Needless to say, I didnât extend my warranty.Sadly, what this all means is that I wasted $1500 bucks and the only thing I got in return was a crummy, poorly made, 300lb clothes hanger.If itâs relevant to any other runners:  I usually run 40-45 miles a week..so, if youâre looking for a treadmill that will hold up, this is not that treadmill.TL;DR  Donât be like me.  Donât buy this poorly made treadmill.

  This took about 3 hours to assemble. Two of the pieces were not manufactured correctly so the thing would not go together properly without having to try to modify the piece. Once I got it assembled it was nice. The track seems to be a little loose even after tightening, and the built in heart monitor is definitely incorrect. Pros are that it came with a year of the iFit membership, its all touchscreen and that it is about $300 cheaper than the NordicTrack website

  As a 270 pound jogger I was afraid I'd beat this machine down. It stands up pretty well. It's not as solid as a commercial one as it will shake on my heavy steps.

Otherwise as a person is put stuff together before I felt confident assembling it. The bolts are staged together in vacuum seal with a number for which step they belong to which made it MUCH simpler to know what to use next.

  So after we got the treadmill all setup, went online and activated it, paid for the subscription. I started to mess around with it and it wouldnât incline. You could hear the motor trying to raise it up but it just wouldnât go. I looked through the manual and they said to try and calibrate the incline so I did and it then went up and down without issue. After I looked at it I noticed it was still inclined and never went back to 0 on the incline, it was stuck at 5. So after exhausting my knowledge I called Nordictrack and they said it sounds like a bad motor or a incline sensor so theyâll be sending me out a new one and I have to install it in 7-10 business days. So now this all happened within the first 2 hours of me having the treadmill and I was a little disappointed with their customer service that itâs going to take 7-10 business days for them to get me the new motor.All and all Iâve still worked out on the treadmill and I love the iFit app that controls the treadmill and your workouts, itâs a great addition to it. The treadmill seems to be build well and itâs very sturdy and overall Iâm happy with the treadmill just very bummed about it not working correctly out of the box.

  I just received my order today and did the set up myself. After finishing the set-up I followed the instruction to activate my treadmill and work on it. However, they are asking me to sign up for a monthly subscription of more than $16. I didn't sign up for that when I ordered the treadmill. Why should I pay every month for life for something I didn't ask for?  I don't need any trainer, I don't need your nutrition advice. I know what I want.  I wanted a treadmill  I didn't sign up for anything else and I won't. i just want to use MY treadmill they way I want, anytime I want. I have been using Amazon prime for many years and I haven't seen anything fishy and un-ethical like this one.  Very disappointed.

  The NordicTrack T Series treadmill has been excellent as I've canceled my gym membership due to COVID-19. The treadmill is heavy and assembly took about 2 hours so I recommend having 2 people as assistance was required. The grounding screw was defective but we had no issues with contacting NordicTrack and getting a replacement screw shipped. The belt can slip a bit at higher speeds, but just make sure to properly adjust the belt with the allen wrench. We did this using YouTube videos for assistance and it's working great. The treadmill isn't too bulky and fits nicely in our basement. It folds easily. I do recommend buying a treadmill mat.The absolute best feature of this treadmill is how it syncs to my iPad to use iFit. The treadmill came with a free 30-day iFit subscription and I was hooked. iFit has a wonderful library of workouts. I started with power walking and now I'm jogging for the duration of my workouts. With the iFit sync, trainers can control your speed and incline which tends to give me the extra push I need. This has helped to motivate me to keep consistent workouts at home. I'm enjoying this so much that I don't anticipate another gym membership post COVID.

  I'm in love with this treadmill. I've waited a long time to replace mine since it broke several years ago. After lots of research I decided on this one but I was skeptical about the iFit membership--thankfully the treadmill came with a year for free. After a month of actively using the treadmill and the iFit training, I will gladly pay for the membership yearly.The machine is very user friendly. It's very easy to fold up each day. I left the hydraulic arm to assist unfolding. It's convenient and saves space.The treadmill was delivered in a heavily damaged box with a small hole in the belt which was a minor set back. I called Nordictack customer service and after providing the serial and model numbers they were able to ship out a new belt that was received within seven business days. Unfortunately, due to COVID, there wasn't an option for a tech to replace it but my husband was handy enough.I'm overall extremely satisfied with my purchase and look forward to using it every day.

    NordicTrack T8.5S: Great Treadmill, Great Price
  
",5.0,David A. Gomez,"Reviewed in the United States June 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've had the 8.5S for a little over a month, and I think it's a solid machine.  I needed to replace my old ProForm CS, which after ONLY 18 years of use gave up.  I was looking for a foldable unit, and one that would fit in a tight space, about 38"" width available.  This one fit the bill, and had good reviews.The assembly took a bit, and does require two people at certain points, but generally speaking it wasn't too difficult.  Once up I created my iFit account-included in my price was a free one year membership.  I was a little skeptical of iFit, as my old CS had ""iFit"" probably v1.0, so 18 years ago that pretty much consisted of running dvd's through an attached computer.  Shockingly, things have changed a bit since then, and I can say I'm really enjoying the guided runs.  There's enough variety and skill levels that you can always find the type of walk/jog/run you want.As for the treadmill itself, very smooth belt, good controls for both incline and speed; the tablet screen is responsive, the speakers are loud enough to hear when you're running at a good pace.  Lots of good metrics are available through the screen, and the information on the tablet during the workout is easy to read, and all the controls are big and easy to read.  Ample storage areas on the treadmill.  The fan is nice, it does a nice job of circulating the air.  My knees have become less forgiving on certain outdoor terrains, and the deck on the 8.5S has provided enough cushioning to allow my to run without any major pain issues that I would normally have running outside.The bluetooth connectivity works fine, but I haven't really listened to my music much, as I'm running mostly with a guided run.All in all, I'm quite happy with the 8.5S, and I can only hope I get 18 years of runs out of it!  ð

  Aight well the treadmill is really good. I get on it as much as I can. The thing I am missing is pretty significant and just noticed it. So I would just set the manual setting and run or jog. Today I wanted to time myself. I go online and search for the setting to set a time or whatever and see that it keep telling me to go to ""set a goal"". I can read and don't see it ANYWHERE on my settings. So I look online to the one that I bought and it has it in the photos. Hey Amazon, can you explain that? I am missing the following buttons: Map, Train, Compete, Track, Set a goal and Lose Wt.My T 6.5S doesnt have those options.

My biggest concern was how this thing would hold up to that kind of workload with me being a big guy ( 6â2â 260lbs ). There was no need for concern as this thing looks and works exactly the same as it did when it was brand new. Older model different brands always required me to adjust the belt constantly.

  We bought this during the stay at home orders and I am so glad!  We love our new treadmill!  It's easy to use and I love traveling to different places all over the world via the iFit.  It makes it not seem like exercise as you get to travel all around the world as you exercise.  Which has been great during the pandemic as there's not much real life traveling going on....I love the large touch screen and the trainer John Peel is my favorite.  I also like that it automatically inclines to go along with what the trainer does.  If I were to purchase another in the future I think I would get one that has the decline feature too- just to make it that much more realistic as you jog up/down a hill for example.  I definitely look forward to exercising now.The only downfall was that we purchased it during the stay at home orders so had to assemble ourselves.  Which we did, but would have been nice to pay someone else to do it and probably would have taken them less time to do it! : )

  First time buying a treadmill. Bought a used one in good condition. Delivery guys didn't properly carry the item and dropped it once. The package had handrails missing, together with a damaged belt. Tracked out to Amazon techincal support. Best way is to register your product and bring up any missing parts and issues in a service ticket on the support website. Contacted nordickTrack support during working hours and they initially said one of the part was back ordered. Was about to return the product , but got the order passed for missing parts. Even got a replacement belt. Assembled everything myself.  Felt the product was very good at the price. Able to perform brisk walking and jogging,  belt needed adjustments initially. Satisfied with the purchase. Customer support was also good.

  I'm overall very satisfied with this purchase. I wanted to buy a treadmill so that I could go running inside (without a mask!) for both physical safety and COVID-related reasons. This is my first treadmill, so I don't know too much about different treadmill brands/features, but it's a great deal for the quality of treadmill, with many different incline and speed buttons and a nice screen display. It's not too loud when running on it and it has nice shock absorption, plus it has built-in speakers so you can plug in your phone to listen to music with an aux cord. I used the iFit app with the treadmill and really liked it, but unfortunately the subscription was so expensive that I stopped using it when the free trial ended. I will say that assembling the treadmill was not easy, and it took several hours, but I didn't want to pay an extra $90 for assembly. I did pay the extra $20 to get the treadmill box delivered to a particular room of the house, which I am very glad I did because it was extremely heavy. Overall I would highly recommend this treadmill for the price!

  I've had treadmills where when you run fast they feel like they're going to fall apart under your feet. A treadmill shouldn't be like a roller coaster though. We ordered the NordicTrack T Series around the holidays when it's too cold to run much where I live and it has been a wonderful treadmill. The only thing negative I have to say is that it took awhile to figure out how to use it without paying NordicTrack for a subscription.With four of us in the house, it seems like someone is always on the thing. Now that it's gotten warmer I kinda' miss watching the news while I run. But I do love getting outdoors. Unlike the kids who try and play video games on the thing... They wouldn't do that on a roller coaster, would they?!?!

They told us we have 55 days to send it back, meanwhile the manufacturer said they will send us a part for us to put it by ourselves.

  Nordic track was not only useless, but unfriendly.  One part was missing and NordicTrack would not even talk to me until I registered the treadmill... which I couldn't do since it had just arrived. (I needed Amazon to get through to NordicTrack) They wouldn't tell me how long it would take to get the part, but said it could take several weeks. I'm still waiting! I can not rate the treadmill since it can't be assembled til I get the part, but the customer support is HORRIBLE.ONE OTHER THING: I'm 75 years old, an the NORDIC TRACK ""customer service"" woman, had the nerve to  force me to give her the serial number of my partially assembled teeadmill which was located on the BOTTOM of the unit. I had to LIFT and HOLD up the track section (with my head and neck) and read her the numbers and at the same time, hold my phone. As a result, I injured my neck.Of course the ""helpful"" customer support woman suggested that I should have someone else HOLD UP the heavy track while I read her the numbers. (I was home alone!) And, as with all the other info I had given her along the way,  she would constantly repeat the info back to me to be sure it was correct, and invarably GOT IT WRONG almost every time!

It only has one screen and that shows you jogging around a track.My old treadmill had me running through a forest at least. The other work outs I can create on my own are interesting because you can go anywhere in the world but they stills - meaning you run as a camera clicks versus a fluid run. It's offsetting - not a big fan of it.All in all, this will get the job done - once I get my handrail fixed.

  Prior to the start of COVID-19 I had been going to the gym a minimum of 4 days a week.  When the gyms shut down I decided to purchase this treadmill for home.  Having a treadmill at home has been awesome and since I donât need to travel to the gym I have been able to spend a bit more time working out.  My favorite feature by far is how it is integrated with iFit.  I enjoy the variety of workouts and programs and complete at least 2 each time I hop on the treadmill.  I do wish the treadmill was quieter when inclining and declining.  Some guided programs have lots of inclines and declines integrated throughout the workout and this can make for a noisy workout.

The pre-loaded programs seem nice, but I cannot seem to establish their speed limits to match my needs/capabilities.  (It can make fast speed changes of 5MPH, which is quite dangerous.)  If this is something I can control, the documentation does not make it very clear.  I would really like to create my own programs, but that feature apparently does not exist.  I still like using this treadmill, but I have to make all elevation and speed changes manually.

  This product was extremely difficult to put together. Not for those who are older. Worst of all, this company stears you into a 30 day free trial for ifit in order to activate the treamill.Of course you have to give them a credit card in advance and cancel before 30 days. Still trying to figure how to cancel.

  I really enjoy this treadmill. We just wanted a reasonably-priced treadmill that you can run on and has an incline option. This product has both. I walk/run on it several times a week and have had no problems at all. Was not too difficult to assemble - just make sure you have someone helping you to speed it up. Not very noisy either - about the same you would hear at the gym. Overall, I am very happy we bought this treadmill.

  Been seeing a lot of negative reviews on this treadmill and it almost made me choose something else, but in the end this was the most cost effective option I found that had an incline. We had to get doorstop delivery because of the virus right now so it was a challenge to get it up the stairs with just me and my husband but we managed. Took an hour or so to put together, and was a process but not overtly difficult. I also liked the iFit idea when I ordered, and after using for a few weeks it's been really great. I like that it changes the speed and the incline for you during the class so you can just go without worrying about the adjustments. It also keeps it more interesting than just walking on the treadmill. The walking classes have been a very cool stress relief during the quarantine. I'm very glad that I went with this machine over a more basic walking treadmill. Didn't want to spend too much as I was worried that I wouldn't use it, might upgrade in the future but for now I just use an iPad to make up for the lack of screen. No regrets.

  Love my new NordicTrack treadmill and the iFit programs.  I would not characterize myself as a serious runner, just an average runner that walk/jogs/runs to keep in shape. I bought the treadmill so that I could walk or run whenever I want and not have to worry about the weather and so I could get my 10k steps in each day while Iâm working from home during Covid.  Iâm on the treadmill at least once a day sometimes twice.  The iFit programs make walking/running more enjoyable with the diverse intensity levels and locations that are brought to you by talented and engaging trainers that keep you motivated.

  The box was damaged upon arrival but the treadmill had no damage at all.  It took two delivery guys to drop it off in my living room.  I decided to tackle the assembly by myself.  It took about 2 hours but that is because I had to drag it down 1/2 flight of stairs and my arthritic hands using the dinky little allen wrench.  Other than struggling to tighten the screws on the  hand rails and the cross bar under the deck, it was easy to assemble. (I suggest getting an allen attachment for electric screw driver or a drill)  I used a pole to prop up the deck while I attached the hydraulic pole.  I held down the ifit button for about 14 seconds and that overrode the ""free trial"" that was supposedly mandatory.  It turned right on and the belt started right up.  I plan to walk/run on it tomorrow so I can't say whether or not is has good cushion.  By the looks/feel of it it's not that great but for the price I'll just invest in more cushioned running shoes. p.s.  I'm about 5'2"", 125# and I was able to maneuver it just where I wanted.  Good thing it was down stairs and not up.

  I am very pleased with this treadmill. It is sturdy, quiet and was easy to assemble. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good machine for a good price. The only issue I have is not so much with Amazon but the shipper they used in our area. They made several excuses as to why the machine was sitting an hour away from me and yet it took four days beyond the second due date for it to reach me. The box was busted in on one area and when opening the crate we found that the cover over the front of the belt was cracked right where the box had been damaged. We had the option of boxing it all back up and sending in back or taking a discount on the total charges. We feel Amazon's offer was adequate and accepted it as this issue would not affect the use of the machine. I don't know if I will order any other large items from Amazon if the same shipping company is used.

  I read many reviews before purchasing this treadmill. It runs very smoothly and is relatively quiet. But what you need to know: 1RST: you do need 2 people. After unpacking, it took 2 of us (an RN and a mechanical engineer) 90 minutes to put together, not counting clean up. Whoever said that they put it together alone must have been a body building contortionist. I don't see any other way. 2ND: the box is much larger than expected- have them deliver it where you want to set it up. 3RD: it does not fold up  flat. It props up in a lean, and sticks out about 3 feet from the console.  4RTH: a huge thank you to the reviewer that said that you do not need to sign up for ifit to use the machine.  Just hold down the ifit button until it unlocks. So, basically a good machine once it is set up. Like the wider tread.

  As a 6'4"", 215 lb runner, I was having a difficult time finding a treadmill that sits low enough that I could comfortably use in my basement, without sacrificing machine performance.  After doing my research and selecting this model, I couldn't be happier!  The box it arrives in is big and heavy - plan on having help getting it to the room you want it (I believe I paid for the delivery service to bring into my basement & that was worth every penny!).  Everything was packed well and arrived in good shape.  With the help of a YouTube video, I was easily able to assemble the treadmill by myself (likely not recommended, but certainly possible!).  The iFit videos are a great way to get lost in your workout whether it's a leisurely walk through a German Christmas market or interval runs through snow-covered mountains.  The treadmill itself is large enough to run with a full stride, the belt is among the quietest I've come across, and (unlike cheaper, lighter off-brands) provides a sturdy base that you can run confidently on!  It folds up nicely and has several places to hold any personal items you need nearby.  Would definitely recommend this & am very happy with my purchase!

  The treadmill arrived on time and was well packaged. Two delivery men placed the treadmill in my house where I asked.them to. The treadmill is VERY HEAVY, so I emphatically suggest putting it near where you expect to use it., or at least move the individual parts a couple at a time. If there are two of you putting it together, no problem. Hopefully, one of you is somewhat handy with reading directions and using hand tools. There is a hex wrench, but it is only good for starting the screws. You WILL need a better hex wrench because of torque needed to fasten the screws down. Also a correct Phillips screwdriver is needed. The instruction booklet is very good. Just slowly and carefully read the instructions. Don't RUSH the installation. I was missing one little star washer, no big deal as I always save extra hardware. Now the good part, the treadmill is very heavy and stable with all kinds of options on using it. I got it for my cardiovascular workout and not wanting to put a lot of pressure on my hips and knees. This treadmill is perfect for me. You can do a lot of different exercises on this unit if you really want to. I usually turn the radio on high,incline to 2 and speed to 3.0 mph for 30 minutes. Absolutely perfect for me!!! As a postscript, this unit isn't really meant for moving around.  (Did I mention it is VERY HEAVY). I also don't plan on lifting the deck up anytime soon. I did install by myself.

  They paint over the screws and bolts making them very hard to put in, stripped 2 trying. Assembly is very difficult with one person as well. However, once you get through that....it seems to be solid and nice. Delivery directions were a bit misleading with set-up being implied including demo and clean up but I found out that was not true...not sure why it was stated without a disclaimer but that is a separate issue. Product itself meets expectations.

I had to call 3 times to get the right parts because the piece kit it came with was incorrect and they kept send the wrong ones....BUT now thatâs itâs finally together and working I havenât had issues. Good machine. Probably wonât buy from them again though because their customer service was very poor in execution though they were nice when they spoke with me.

People will not but this if ifit is not resolved. Nordick track take notice. quality is great. I only have it for a month running. I just want a treadmill that works with no ""fancy"" subscriptions.

  After purchasing another treadmill that was a nightmare, my son recommended this treadmill.  It is bigger than the last one, but, it works wonderfully. the assembly took us a little longer than I thought it would, but my son and I took our time and made sure we did it correctly. It really wasn't hard at all, only issue was the display came already assembled and I had to assure myself we were doing it right before we continued. No adjustments had to be made, I just turned it on and it worked. I did take the advice of other reviewers to bypass the IFit, so that wasn't an issue, either. I don't think it is too loud, so this is a perfect fit for me!

  I was hesitant to purchase this treadmill because I wasnât sure just how much it relied on the iFit app subscription, but I needed something with the gyms closed, and outdoor temps of 110 or higher, so I decided to chance it on this treadmill because of the affordability and NordicTrack reputation.  The iFit app does offer a lot in terms of workouts/training, but is not necessary to use this treadmill. There are 20 built in workouts to choose from, or you can just run in manual mode. Any of those options still allow you to change speed and incline at any time. You can adjust the softness/fitness of the tread platform, and at 6â2â 190 lbs the platform is plenty long enough where I donât feel like I need to crowd the front for fear of coming off the back. Also no issues of the belt stalling, or stuttering, with any footstep landings.  The only cons I really have for this treadmill is that you canât input your height/weight setting, and you canât create custom workouts (other than manually adjusting on the fly while running in manual mode).

  Please note that before you are even allowed to turn this treadmill on you are FORCED to log into an ""Ifit.com"" website and enter your credit card number and sign up for an auto renewal monthly membership of $15/month.  There are warnings all over the treadmill and STOP and BEFORE FIRST USE you must ""activate"" your machine.  Meaning you have to log onto this website and ""activate"" your monthly subscription - you are allowed to cancel anytime but this is a ridiculous bait and switch tactic and entirely unacceptable.  I already paid for the treadmill - If I wanted the monthly subscription I would sign up; but forcing new purchasers to sign up before they can even turn on their treadmill (you need an activation code) you are forcing something on us we may not want.  If these were easy to return I would - and I suspect that's part of their reasoning - people are just going to do this b/c they don't want the hassle of returning a heavy treadmill.  Well you got what you wanted but I want to make clear every prospective purchaser - Beware of this forced requirement.  Buy at your own risk.

  After spending almost 2hrs to assemble this by myself, the last step requires you to ""activate"" the treadmill via iFIT.  Once on iFIT, you have to provide a credit card to proceed to the next step to activate the treadmill.  While the first month of iFIT service is free, it automatically enrolls you in a $15/month plan, unless you then go back into the site to unsubscribe.  After spending $650 and 2hrs to assemble a treadmill, do you really think someone wants to have to provide a credit card to turn the damn thing on?!

  I've been using this treadmill for about three months and have been very pleased. It's a great treadmill for squeezing in a quick workout. Many of the lower-priced treadmills I looked at were for walking only, so the fact that I could actually run on this one stood out. I haven't used this one at it's top speeds but it's been very capable and comfortable for easy and moderate runs. The ability to change the stiffness is a really nice feature. I've done a little bit with the iFit integration, but not sure if I will keep it. It feels a little small and cramped compared to the gym treadmills I've used, but I'm sure I would need hundreds more for that quality. This treadmill is a great value for the money.I highly recommend paying the little bit extra for professional assembly as well as the delivery upcharge to deliver to a specific room in your house.

I'm 6' 3"" tall and have never felt like I was running out of space. I'm also 250lbs and quite often run into ""slip"" issues on other treadmills where my weight would cause the treadmill to lose grip and slip beneath me. I have not had any issues with that so far. Assembly is a little difficult, but not too bad with the help of someone else. Make sure you read EVERY step though. I missed two covers (aesthetic only) and I didn't notice until the end.

  Buyer Beware! We had nothing but trouble with this treadmill since we received it. We paid for the professional installation, but from day one, there was a really loud squeak from back roller. I contacted Amazon and the rep suggested that it may have been a problem with the installation. The installer came back out and took a look and just confirmed that there was a loud squeak at the roller. Then, while my teenage son is running on the treadmill, it just cuts out and loses power. I called NordicTrack this time and they suggested that I get a professional electrician out to check that the treadmill is on a dedicated circut. I had an electrician come out and everything was set up the way it was supposed to. He even measured the amps for the treadmill and we had plenty of power to run it (20 amp). Four days later and now the belt just stops moving when you step on it. I finally had enough and just called Amazon. AMAZON OFFERED A COMPLETE REFUND ON BOTH THE TREADMILL AND ASSEMBLY. I really appreciated that, but I cannot recommend this machine to anyone. Now I have to find a way of disposing of this piece of junk. Probably have to pay to have it moved to the dump. Frustrating!  Love Amazon, but will never order or recommend any product from NordicTrack again.

I love the ledge it really holds my cell phone in place and the two side cup holders are square and flat at the bottoms. I use one for my water bottle and the other for the remotes to our TV and Roku. Great quality item. And, I loved that they offered a 3-year in home warranty I mean who wants to drag a treadmill to the shop for repairs and they'll replace it if they can't fix it...NICE!

  The treadmill is heavy, so make sure you take a help of another perosn to get it to where you want to have this installed. moving around in the same room is easy, but to a different floor level should be thought out prior to assembly.The assembly and set up was easy,with the help of the instructions. I wish there was a way to disassemble this without having to take the entire top portion apart, there could have been a better way to attach the wires connecting the controls. but its okay, managable. one of the cup holders was broken in shipping I guess, I called the customer care and they send a replacement. so its okay.the set up needs to be with IFIT log in, but it was easy, I dont usually use the ifit options, I have my own routine, so it doesnt matter. so far its working very well, no problems . overall quality product.

  This is a great treadmill, which we have had now for a couple of days.  We will see how it continues to function.  But it is a very sturdily built piece of equipment.  I have one main concern:  trying to get through to them to activate took nearly an hour on hold!  However, once I got through, the lady was very helpful.  We did not want to make use of the ability for the treadmill to be on line.  To get around this only takes pushing the small blue button, entitled ""IFit"", for about 30 to 60 seconds, until all zero's came up on the screen.  But it took me all that time on hold to find this out.  If you are not interested in using the internet connection, just go straight to the blue button.  It does take 2 to put together.  I highly recommend the treadmill itself.

  I've owned this treadmill since January thinking it was my new year's resolution to get fit. Since the whole Covid19 situation, this purchase makes more sense than ever. I've been running almost everyday for about 4-6 miles everytime. This treadmill is amazing for the price.  The ifit program is a great feature because there are all types of instructors that push you! The treadmill was fairly easy to put together.  You need atleast 2 people,  a wrench and alot of patience.  Took about 2 hours or so to assemble. I'm glad to have purchased this as I use it everyday. It beats going to the gym when I can run in the privacy of my home. I would highly recommend buying this product!

  I was looking for a quality treadmill to fit into a relatively low-ceilied basement (less than 9 feet high) that had a belt long and wide enough for somone 6 ft. 1. This NordicTrack fit the bill. The treadmill has a low belt (and a convenient fold-up storage feature), but is a comfortable width and length. I also appreciate that the treadmill can be set to a specific speed up to a tenth of a MPH. Assembly was easy (was able to do it with my husband at home). The treadmill was also a very, very reasonable price for the quality. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a starter treadmill, and who may have limited space for the equipment.

  When I received the item there was some cosmetic imperfections in the plastic engine cover which wasn't unexpected since I bought this via an Amazon Warehouse deal and this was disclosed. Unexpectedly, the incline motor was bad and was unresponsive to any input. Customer service took a couple of weeks to get back to me which brings the overall review down to 4 stars, but when they did, they sent the replacement products based on my explanation of the issue and had a local technician reach out to me and schedule the repair. After the repair was complete, it now works flawlessly on the incline. I understand things like this happen, and they stood by their warranty albeit with not overly fast service.Overall a great purchase for the home gym. I use it 2-3 times per week and it feels very sturdy and like it will last a long time.

  I've had this machine for nearly 3 months, and use it 3 to 4 times a week. I'm not a big guy at 215 lbs, just have a little spare tire from quarantine. Unfortunately, this machine louds croaks and groans several times during a workout when changing inclines. It is very noticeable and causes some anxiety when I start interval running or high-incline hiking. I'm just waiting for the support structures to crash down mid-workout and take me with it.The interface is pretty easy to use and understand. The iFit program is the greatest part of the workout though, since you can select a video and the program will adjust your speed and incline while you focus on the trainer and scenery (or tv).Would I buy this again? Maybe, if the price point were lower and more in line with quality of the machine I received. It is overpriced for the lack of quality.

  This has been a great purchase! The touch screen makes using iFit extremely easy to navigate, and the iFit program has been well worth it also. Putting it together took about an hour and half, but easy to follow directions of where everything goes. Also, super easy to fold to clean under or to push out of the way. The only issue that I've had is that it's not bluetooth compatible on the revision I bought, and the aux cord is for input only...so you can't jack in to hear the iFIT audio (I just run the app and the machine at the same time to hear the audio). Overall, it's been an a great purchase and couldn't be happier with it.

  Love my nordictrack. This has been a lifesaver during quarantines hot summer months with my gym being closed. My husband put it together by himself. It did take him a few hours but was successful. It does not have a huge footprint in the room we put it in, it doesnât take up too much space. The programs are amazing- you can go to a different country every day and exercise while learning something new and distracting yourself from the exercise. You can also use this as a regular treadmill without the programs. Overall, I would recommend this to anyone and everyone, it was SO worth the investment. I love it and use it every day.

",5.0,Dan Burns,"Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is a fantastic home treadmill that has all of the functions, speeds and features that I could ask for.  It was relatively easy for two of us to put together in about an hour (you definitely need two people). The hardest part was getting it from the front door to the basement because of how heavy it is.  My only complaint is the attempt to force us into signing up for an ifit membership.  There were big, bold notices on top of all of the paperwork and the treadmill itself saying it won't function until you register for an annual ifit membership, which I did not want to do.  Thankfully I read a lot of reviews ahead of time and learned that I could get around this loophole by holding down on the ifit button on the console for 15 seconds the first time I turned it on.  Thank goodness this worked because I would have been upset to have to register and pay for a membership that I didn't want AFTER spending hundreds of dollars on a new treadmill.  Hopefully NordicTrak will reverse this strong-arming practice with ifit for future customers.

  We received the treadmill in time and in good condition. Appreciate the packaging from Nordictrack.I gave a 3-star as I ran into some problems, and havent had the chance to start up the treadmill. My $600 investment has to wait for another week to experience the ROI!!1. The equipment is heavy, so you need 2 adults to help with the initial assembly.2. Strange that the pre-attached screw for grounding at the bottom of the Right handrail fits better than the one provided in the pack.3.  The equipment comes with some pre-attached screws. I am still not clear why screws are pre-attached when they anyway need to be discarded!! Maybe there is an engineering reason?4. While setting up the handrails, there are 2 sets of pre-attached screws on each handrail. I could remove 3 of them but the fourth one wont budge. Its seems to have got stuck in the body of the handrail or the threads are stuck. Unless I remove it, I cant fit the console with the screws provided in the hardware kit. I reached out to their Customer Service chat and after a few minutes of online conversation, they ordered a new Left handrail. I have to wait for 5-6 days for that part to arrive.So, eagerly waiting to receive the part and experience the treadmill!=====Phase 2: Received the part but was the wrong one !! I had an issue with the Left Handrail and after speaking with the Customer Service agent, she ordered the same part. However, ended up receiving the Left Upright. Anyway, I then ended up going to Home Depot and remove the screw with a power tool with their help.So far, the treadmill's been running well.

NO NO NO NO NO NO NO. Absolutely NO. When I pay for a product, it should not be locked out because of some ""Extra Optional"" feature. We bought this expecting to be able to start it up and go, but were locked out by the software. This is the most shady practice I have ever experienced in my life and will not be buying another Norditrac product.Aside from being a useless brick until you surrender your credit card information; after you do that, it does work well as a treadmill. Relatively low profile and has a good solid step.

  Pro- Good for home cardo.- The majority of the assembly instructions were clear.Con- I bought an extended warranty through amazon, and it took a long...long time to get my paperwork in the mail. I tried to contact ICON Fitness customer service but had a hard time getting ahold of someone. The majority of the time, no one was available, or I kept getting transferred. It was frustrating.- The belt kept moving to the right. Should have been already aligned. However, the good point is that there are instructions in the manual on how to align it.General Point- Good for an owned house or first-floor apartment. For higher levels without an elevator, it will be a real pain to carry or even have it carried up the stairs

  We purchased this after comparing to other makes and models. The NordicTrack T 6.5s is all we could ask for at this price point.I was able to assemble this completely by myself but would probably be better with one other person if possible.The one thing that was not in the instructions was getting the console out of the ""iFIT activation"" screen, which you cannot get past without holding the iFIT button on the console until the screen changes to manual mode.Nowhere was this in the instructions and I was lucky enough to come across the tip searching Google for ""4 beeps when any button pushed on NordicTrack T 6.5s console"".One thread had this tip buried in the comments.That was the only hiccup in the assembly and start up.Very pleased with this treadmill!

  First, when assembling, the drilled holes were too small for the screws. After an hour on hold for customer service, I was told ""just use all your body weight and really shove them in - I can send you new parts but they won't work either"". WHAT? Then, as we lifted the treadmill for the final steps of construction (every step was labored) the entire bottom metal bar is bent! It is where the metal is super thick, so I don't even know how that could have happened except maybe in the factory, it's much more than someone dropping the thing or anything. I am so frustrated!

  I'm very much in love with my new Norditrack treadmill. I use it everyday and I use the ifit programs that come with the machine. I just finished my 4th week running on the beaches of Costa Rica with ifit trainer Ana Maria. It was amazing, and the treadmill runs smoothly, mostly all the time with the exception of some skipping. Which is the reason for it not getting a full 5 stars, when the machine is at a higher speed over 5rpe then the belt skips. I keep meaning to call Norditrack about this issue because it should not be having this problem being so new. I got the warranty just in case. Aside from that its wonderful and I love it.

  This purchase has proven to be one of the worst Iâve ever done on Amazon. The treadmill never worked after assembly.

NordicTrack has very limited phone support (only 6 hours during the weekend) and nobody picks up phones. The only phone line attended is the sales line!The person who assembled the treadmill (hired by Nordic) said heâve seen many defected treadmills coming from factory but he is equipped only for assembly and canât do anything to fix the problem.Total nightmare.

  This Nordic Track T series treadmill performed as expected and better. First of all, right out of the box it seemed slightly overwhelming to put it together but with the simple installation instructions it made it simple and quick to put together. I did not have any problems. Took about 30 min. My family and I all love it and we have had it for a couple of months now. It has worked flawlessly.  Out of the box there was a small cut in the belt and I contacted customer service and they were really polite to work with and they quickly sent out a replacement part. As for the folding and storage it is surprisingly easy to fold up, even my 10 year old can do it. So far the product has been great, the customer service has been great and it has been fun for me and my family. I definitely recommend this product to anyone thinking of setting up an in home gym.

  I have had this treadmill for about 3 months now, and absolutely love it. It replaced my old Nordic track that I purchased in 2002 and used regularly for 18 years before I decided it was time for an upgrade (it is still working fine and I plan to donate it to charity!). The big selling point for me purchasing this particular treadmill was the sturdiness of the device and the online reviews that had nothing negative to say about it, plus the iFIT capability, to which I am now addicted. Due to COVID I miss the ability to travel, and with iFIT I've been able to visit and do hikes and walks from coast to coast as well as many foreign countries and exotic islands. In short, it's awesome. I am also thrilled that you do NOT have to be a runner to enjoy the iFIT products or this treadmill. With the ability to do a 12% incline, plus the variety of iFIT programs, I can walk and incline hike until my heart is content. I have nothing short of praise for this treadmill.

  I've maybe left one or two negative reviews in my entire adult life, and I wish I didn't have to leave this one. The only reason I went with this product was that similar treadmills from other brands contained toxic chemicals known to cause cancer and birth defects. (Probably the only good thing I can say about this treadmill.)Assembly is a nightmare. I'm guessing they expect you to pay for professional assembly. That's the only reason this could be so difficult. The assembly process is confusing and convoluted. Screw holes are not threaded and need to be tapped, screws are painted over and so do not fit easily. They did not include the hand rails and so I had to get in touch with Nordic Track and request the missing parts. When they arrived, half of the parts were still missing. And when I finally got it assembled, it seems the treadmill is locked and cannot be used without downloading an app. Thankfully, I found the hack to bypass this here on amazon. Started it up and the belt seems a bit loose. Wonderful.

  I really love this treadmill for working out BUT Iâm really disappointed that itâs not childproof for little kids. I have to keep my treadmill folded up because itâs in a tight space.. and itâs SO EASY for it to unfold. You literally just lightly kick the bar underneath it and the track starts to come down. Thatâs a little worrisome when you have a curious toddler who likes to touch everything, she could easily push that bar and it would come falling down on her so for now we have a temporary box around it when Iâm not using it for her safety. Iâm really surprised thereâs no way to lock it when itâs folded up :/

  I got this treadmill 4 months ago and it has been doing great for me. Assembly was pretty easy, the manufacturer seems to have thought out the assembly well. I'm able to fit on this treadmill in my basement (not full height, probably just shy of 7') with no issues, and I'm 6'2"".As far as using the treadmill, I have only experienced some minor creaking from the unit when it tries to increase the incline. I bought the extended warranty after the purchase, so I'm not too worried about this. Power wise, the speed seems very consistent and gets there quickly. I've had no issues of it slowing down on me while running, despite me being a bigger guy (6'2"", ~265 lbs). I've been using it several times per week as I'm trying to get back into shape to do some triathlons. I don't foresee me exhausting the 10 MPH speed maximum for quite some time.The iFit experience was OK, but not worth the 15$ a month to me. I used it during the free trial and enjoyed it, but did not continue.Overall I'm very happy with the treadmill and have recommended it to several friends.

You also have to buy an aux adapter to use bluetooth earbuds.  It also has no fan (or donut maker).  So it's basic, but does the job for a great deal!

  The NordicTrack NTL17915 T 6.5 S Treadmill replaces a 16 yr old Nordic Track model which provided excellent service until the motor finally failed.  Repair costs and difficulty finding replacement parts made purchase of a newer reasonably priced model a prudent decision.  For the first three months of usage, it has performed to expectations and although primary usage is for two senior citizens, it has plenty of bells and whistles for more strenuous workouts.  Technician assembled unit in under two hours, provided good instructions for initial usage, and cleaned up prior to departing.If I could be certain that it will perform to the level of my previous Nordic Track , and if warranty service (should it be necessary) is prompt and convenient, I would certainly up the rating to 5-star.

  This treadmill is great for $600, it has great support for your knees with the adjustable cushioning and you can customize and automate your workouts with the nify iFit app.My issue is with support.This treadmill worked great (almost daily use) but it stopped working after about 4 months. The display would blink and the motor stop within 10 seconds of starting a workout. I got in touch with their customer service guys and they were able to diagnose the issue within minutes. The console had fried, I needed a new one.They were to ship me the console and the upright wire. The wire arrived probably less than a week after I talked to them. The console has not arrived up to now. I have been in touch with their customer service to get an estimate when I can receive it, all they say is ""Out of stock"".Waiting 41 days for a part to arrive is insane. It might be OK with iFit, but if you have a plan to get fit, it definitely throws a wrench in your plans.

  The treadmill has good shock absorption and we love the free iFit trainer programs for one year, so much we will probably renew. If you don't want to use them or get the renewal, the treadmill can be used without those programs, despite the reviews. The heart rate monitors are placed in an inconvenient position so we don't use those at all, plus they don't seem very accurate when we have used them. The arms of the treadmill are also pretty short, but probably so it folds more compactly. Assembly was fairly simple, but there were some screws that didn't go in properly due to manufacturing of the screw holes.The one thing we're not happy at all with is that the display where all the speed and incline buttons started peeling almost immediately, trapping what looks like moisture inside (see photos). Not sure if we just have a defective layer on our display, but if not, it's very low quality.

  I bought this treadmill in April, it came half assembled, I only had to assemble the poles and controller (display). The instructions were clear and I was able to assemble it within less than 1.5hrs myself. Then I was excited to operate it, thanks to other reviewer who mentioned that iFit account is not required, so I long pressed the iFit icon next to the display and thats it, the treadmill is ready to use. Me and my wife have been using it for almost a month (everyday) and I really like it, I am yet to explore all the settings, but it does what is supposed to. As I work from home as everyone else due to pandemic, I often use it whenever I have meetings :-). I almost lost 4kgs in about 3 weeks (with some diet control too) and I am really happy about it.The treadmill is sturdy and it is not shaking much even when I run, not so noisy. I can easily jump to any speed and incline level directly without keep pressing the plus (+) icon. It has a wide holder that can hold the iPad Pro too. Overall, satisfied purchase!

  Purchased this for cold, rainy, inclement weather days. However, I use it as my sole source for running, even on sunny days!  Husband and 11 year old son set it up in an hour!!  Quiet, has all the bells and whistles I need, and very affordable. Large, smooth running board, easy to use controls, and love the 2 large storage spaces!

  Got my unit today and had professional installation. The unit works and I am surprised how smooth the belt ran compared to crappy treadmill my apartment gym have or previous treadmill I owned. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for huge burn marks on treadmill hood. It has huge scars on hood and it is down right ugly. It may be a bad luck and doesn't effect treadmill function but I don't think I can ignore this as it bothers me every time I try to use this treadmill. NordicTrack. Please send someone to replace hood or send me a part. >:(

  The treadmill console speed button function stopped after one month. Especially, if you're a fast runner, do not buy this treadmill. I'm only 170lbs and run at a fast pace. The treadmill is not sturdy when I run at over the speed of 8. Also, the warranty service is awful.  Generally, I don't leave negative feedback, but this treadmill is not worthy of money.

  After a couple of hours of assembly, I just wanted to see if the treadmill ran.  I flipped the power switch and... I'm locked out.  ""Go to ifit.com/activiate"".  I had to create an account, enter my credit card info, download an app, pair the treadmill to my phone, and then and only then could I run the flipping treadmill I spent hundreds on.Outrageous.  I then had to go through a lengthy cancellation process with 4 ""are you sure?"" screens to make sure I don't get charged every month for a service I didn't ever want.For all I know the actual treadmill works fine, but who cares.  I never would have bought this thing if I knew it came bundled with trashy business practices.

  Amazon didn't like my first review so I will try again to meet their guidelines. I was sent the wrong pieces needed to assemble this machine. NordicTrack customer service will take a large portion on your day and patience to remedy the situation.  They then offer to send part in 7-10 days but will expedite shipping if you complain. Quality of machine seems inferior to my old Sole treadmill.  Amazon customer service tech Leon was helpful and did a great job assisting. He gets 5 stars....Nordictrack gets a 2 before I even get it turned on.

Hold down the ifit button after it starts up and tells you to activate online.  the red key magnet needs to be in place.  You only need to do this once, then it is a normal treadmill after that.

  Excellent product, very high quality. Better quality than most treadmills I've used at the gym. Simple to adjust incline and speed. It syncs with iFit cardio which is a subscription service, but if you own an iPad I strongly encourage the use of the app as it is very immersive and fun. Using the app you won't have to do any manual adjustments at all. There are a ton of videos for all levels of training from beginner to experienced. My wife and I had so much fun we ran a combined 8 miles the day we set it up. The training videos are engaging and shot from a first hand view in locations all around the world from Italy, to France, to south america, beaches, cities, and mountains. As well as group training sessions. I never like running on treadmills because of the tedium. But these videos are a beautiful distraction and allow me to get a great 20 minute run in simply instead of having to leave my house and add travel time.Set up its easy if you follow instructions and take your time. It helps to have another person just because this is a sturdy piece of equipment and tough to maneuver before it's completely assembled.Con: You do need to activate it initially and put a card on file to use it. But you can cancel immediately. I didn't like this feature because if you don't have a card or easy internet access it would be frustrating for a person to setup. It's really my only complaint and it has nothing to do with the equipment.

  I purchased the T9.5 after reviewing several models in fitness stores.  I mainly exercise in front of the TV, though I bought the treadmill because of the large screen and the option to connect to ifit in the future.  There are many pre-loaded trails and programmed workouts that I use.  The treadmill is easy to choose an existing program or use it in manual mode.  My one comment is that it does take a minute to start the program each time the treadmill is used.  The ramp operation is smooth.  I am very happy overall with the treadmill and highly recommend Nordic track.  I had the treadmill was delivered and assembled as part of the purchase price.  Delivery was excellent: on time and placed it exactly where I wanted it.  The assembly crew was okay.  They were not experienced, but they figured it out.

  I only have the T 6.5 S for a couple of weeks. The assembly instructions are very clear as well as the parts are identified by construction step number. My only problem was thst in step 2 I imissed the installation of the covering boots and I had to dissambly the entire treadmill. The second assembly went very fast.This is a big treadmill and it will not pass thuogh standard home door without major manuvering by 2 strong individuals.It has the stard controls expected from a quality tradmill and a bluetooth connection. You will need your phone to activate the tradmill througj iFit. This for me was a major negative. Regardless what IFit has to offer I would much prefered to look for such application ruther than being forced down my throat.

This one shakes when you walk on it (the upper portion not the actual tread path) as it is made from thinner metal. Overall happy with the purchase.

  Bought this treadmill for the apartment when the building gym was shut down due to COVID. Itâs a good value for the price. Opted for the smaller screen (~5 inches) due to cost and availability. Has all the basics to get a good workout in. Accelerates quickly when changing speeds. May be a little more difficult to use if youâre a taller individual / have a longer stride  Paid for someone to assemble it and it took him < 1 hour. Overall good purchase and would recommend.

  Installation took a couple of hours only to figure out the incline does not work. That is in addition to the deceptive marketing content in the box about requiring an iFit account for this to work. It does not.Customer support was bad - no effort to dig into the issue - all they had to offer was I will send you a part that I think will solve the problem, but I am not sure. In addition, you have to open heavy equipment to install it (Even when I was within the warranty/had bought extra service package). Go fork yourself customer - and buy again.

  Iâve had this treadmill for 3 months. I get a lot of use out of it and it performs to expectation. However, I have 3 complaints.First, it apparently comes with a free 1 year subscription of their digital fitness program, but they still want me to enter my credit card. So I didnât end up using it.Second, I find it to be a bit pricey to not have built in fans on the main console like most treadmills, stair masters, etc nowadays do.Third, and this one is the one that actually really bothers me, the heart rate sensors absolutely unequivocally do not work. I can be at the end of a 6 mile run and the sensor reads 65bpm, which of course is poppycock. This part never worked properly.If that part is important to you, you might want to check to make sure that works right away and if it doesnât, call their customer support which frankly isnât something I ever did since I assembled it myself out of the box and didnât want to hassle with returning it (box was incredibly heavy).Overall, itâs a treadmill with a digital screen that has some cool features that I mostly never use, and it largely works as a home treadmill should.

The shock absorbers on the running platform are exceptionally strong for smooth running/walking use.  The IFIT additional add-on is an awesome bonus to the NordicTrack 6.5 SI.

  Assembly was fairly easy, although some steps took a little work.  Once assembled, the treadmill works great, and has been a lifesaver during this quarantine/lockdown.  Walking or running on it feels safe and secure.  Two large compartments are large enough for water bottle, towel, etc...  I also love the shelf which can be used for a tablet/phone so you can watch something while exercising.  Only small complaint is that the power switch is located on the front of the treadmill, at the bottom, right where the motor is. It's a slightly inconvenient location if the treadmill is placed near a wall.  Highly recommend a mat to put underneath, both to protect the floor and keep the treadmill stable.  Overall, very happy with the purchase.

  I'm really enjoying this treadmill. The belt is a perfect width (not too narrow) and the the length is great too.The  incline / speed ""one touch"" controls are my favorite part of this treadmill. I don't have to spend time pressing up or down buttons multiple times while running, I just press once on the # I want.I don't use the iFit app so I can't report on experience with that. When you first turn on the treadmill the screen will ask you to register with iFit. To bypass that, you just hold down the iFit button for about 20 seconds and then it takes you to the treadmill screen. You only have to do that once. The next time you turn on the treadmill it'll take you directly to the treadmill screen.Convenient shelf allows me to rest my phone comfortably so I can watch something on it, and and the cup holders allow me to keep water easily accessible.

You receive a complimentary free one year trial upon purchase! I can âgoâ on runs and hikes in global destinations like Hawaii or Thailand. They have engaging trainers and highly realistic scenes. There are so many virtual runs/hikes to choose from: from beginner walks and hikes to advanced/marathon runs, and everything in between. You can also download the iFIT app & simultaneously follow and track your progress on your smart phone. I always check in with the calendar on the touch screen; which helps me see, track, and monitor my goals. There treadmill track is also long which I LOVE! I am 5â8 and my boyfriend is 6â1..we each have a long stride while running, and we can run at fast paces easily and comfortably, with the longer length of the track. Assembly directions were clear and relatively easy for my boyfriend to assemble!

Thatâs the only reason they didnât get all 5 stars! It makes me look at Nordic track differently that they have to use sneaky gimmicks to get your info, (including for some people their credit card info.) But you can BYPASS the registration. Put the safety key in and press and hold the Ifit button. It works. Whatâs sad is the company does not offer this direction to those that arenât interested in Ifit.I used the amazon assemblers to put my treadmill together.. It took him 3 hours and I heard a lot of sighing. He did an excellent job, but I donât think it was easy..( probably cause the instructions say itâs a 2 person job and he came alone).

  I , alone, put this together. I am 46 yr old woman.  I carefully read the instructions, step by step, and it was VERY helpful that each step was also written on the screws/supply package. Because of this , I knew exactly what to do. It took me 2 hours to assemble.  It was also Very helpful to read other people's reviews on this , because when it came time to turn it on, I knew how to bypass the ifit membership.  This treadmill is built strong, running pad and motorization is great, and the computerized screen is great too.

  We got this treadmill a few months ago and have been very pleased overall.  Easy to assemble and quick to setup and start using.  We never tried the iFit feature / membership and emailed them to cancel it so we wouldn't be charged monthly.  No issues in regard to the iFIt membership at all (very easy to cancel).My wife and I each run on this a few times a week and have really enjoyed it while it is too cold/snowy to run outside.  It doesn't have a big TV screen so if we want to watch something there is a place for your phone or ipad.  We only give it four stars for a couple reasons: 1) we have ran on nicer/smoother/better treadmills 2) not sure the MPH is calibrated correctly (seems slow).  We bought it to run on when too cold outside so we were really looking for dependability and reliability.  Four months in and we're very pleased -- it has been really solid, allowed us to run, and no mechanical / computer issues whatsoever.  Great product at a good price!

  To use this treadmill you have to activate it on the IFIT website. This website is very deceptive. All it contains are misleading membership registrations (I joined by accident and had a very difficult time trying to cancel it). I tried contacting them by email through their website, but all I got was a message ""There is a problem with sending your email"". Like I said, shady.

I love how I didn't have to break the bank to have a reliable and sturdy treadmill that didn't feel like it was going to fall apart when you actually run. I also did the free trial of Ifit and liked how the app syncs with the treadmill (when the incline goes up on the app, the treadmill will move your incline up as well!).If you are looking for an affordable, sturdy, treadmill with a few bells and whistles, then this is definitely the one to get!

  Well I can't review this product because it's not yet assembled.  Half-way through the assembly, the technician discovered that there were two right handrails in the box - and no left handrail.

Pretty disappointing first impression of a $600 product...I definitely recommend paying the extra $20 to have the box delivered to the room where it will be assembled - the box is super big and heavy.

  So the treadmill when using it as a treadmill is great. If you're buying this for the smart integration though it's a hot mess. You are forced to sign up for a free trial that automatically renews at 15$/month unless you cancel and when cancelling you can't type your cancellation reason so their metrics show either ""not used enough"", ""too pricey"" or ""technical issues"". The treadmill IS great, especially if you just hold the ifit button for 30 seconds to completely skip the ""MANDATORY SETUP PROCESS"" it's great.

This checks all of those boxes so I am pleased with the treadmill itself. However, the assembly was a real pain. Many of the bolts are impossible to screw all the way in because of the angle or tools provided, and some holes don't exactly line up. There are some screws that come screwed in, that you have to take out and replace, which are extremely difficult to remove. The instructions specifically say not to use power tools, but it is impossible to remove or screw in some of the hardware with just a traditional wrench. We searched for assembly videos of this model online, and some people had different types of bolts/screws, so it might vary on the one that you receive.

  I'm happy with the treadmill but there is a catch. It's very sturdy and has all the features I want. Definitely great quality. However, I purchased the Amazon assembly options. The guy put it together in less than an hour however it looks a little crooked. The only thing this affects is being able to fold the treadmill. It doesn't fold properly. Other than that the treadmill works just fine.

  I needed a new treadmill right away and I found this and the price was right.  It looked similar to the Nordic Track that I already had.  The delivery was very good and my husband put it together that night.  It is not as heavy or sturdy as the Nordic Track I had before, but it is a good product at this price and does what I need it to do.  I do miss not having the fan on this one, which I had on my old one.  I would recommend this product.

",4.0,RR,"Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  After researching for a while and a few weeks of using it every day, this Nordictrack was a very good choice for about $600. Just make sure to carefully read the instructions during assembling and follow each step before moving to the next one. Easy manuals and pre-program workouts, also a free month of iFit training. You can press the iFit button for about 10 seconds to bypass the machine to use the manual workouts. You can register to iFit if you want and the credit card is optional. Theirs workouts are very engaging and challenging. ALWAYS CLIP THE KEY TO YOUR BODY FOR SAFETY. No many complaints at this moment, more updates later.

  Have had this product less than 7 months, am under warranty, and nothing but problems persist. The belt on the treadmill makes a salt shaking sound and sticky residue is left after every use.I have had to jump through numerous flaming hoops to try to get a service repair person out to fix (again, under watranty). At each attempt, I am met with some offshore tech support person who refuses to speak over the phone, bombards me with unreasonable email requests (e.g., requests for personal information, videos, pictures. Explanations for items I have already outlined). It is very clear their customer service department purposely gives you the runaround and makes it close to impossible for you to get the requisite service to which you are entitled under warranty.Overall miserable experience

  Fantastic so far! Came with a free year of iFit. Doubt Iâll pay for it next year as I mostly use manual mode. My 8 year old loves the trainer hikes though! Wish it was easier to browse and save a workout found on my phone - that could use some improvement. Quiet and sturdy. Fairly easy to put together. Wish the handles were longer and had the heart rate monitor on them as my arms seem to short to take my heart rate without hitting front of the belt. Would have been full 5 star rating if it had a built in fan.. missed that when purchasing!

  My first priority was that the track needs to be wide and inclination should be good. This machine satisfied both. I was able to run/walk comfortably with full incline.  Ifit is optional you can get past that and workout on your own - you do need to register first time though.  Folding option is good for space saving. Delivery was perfect and assembly instructions are good. Very cost-effective  when all the gyms are closed now. Awesome product.

It will erase the distance and calorie information.  2.  After pausing, it won't start when I hit the start button.  I have to remove the safety key, place it back on to start.

  Live in Texas - since the pandemic, I was walking 4 miles in the neighborhood but it got too hot!  My gym had reopened but I was very uncomfortable with the way people walked in with their masks on, but once they got upstairs, they were off.  People didn't wipe down machines.  I was very uncomfortable with the lackaidasical attitude of people there.  My son-in-law scoped out machines and recommended this one.  We ended up hiring someone from taskmaster to put it together but we love it!  I do go to the gym occasionally to do the elliptical but every time I go, I am dismayed by the utter disregard to the regulations posted by the club and the fact that none of the staff goes upstairs to the aerobic and weight area to enforce their rules.

  Wow this NordicTrack is worth every penny, not nosy at all, you can get a great work out. Listen if you want to bypass the ifit subscription make sure that your equipment is fully installed. I got anxious and I had it fully installed by 90 percent, with out the safety key. I tried to bypass by pressing down on the ifit but it wouldnât work. So I called customer service and they guide me.  The representative stated that the equipment needs to be fully installed,  the safety key needs to be on or it will not work. So I tried that method and boom it worked. So if you want to bypass the ifit you can hold down for 30 seconds AFTER YOUR EQUIPMENT IS FULLY INSTALLED. I refuse to add another bill to my budget even if itâs 15 dollars a month. You can manually use it without the subscription.

Assembly was pretty straightforward, with a couple of confusing steps. The recommended 3-D assembly app doesn't offer any guidance beyond what's in the assembly booklet. The machine works well and seems sturdy. Unless you sign on for the i-fit subscription, the console doesn't store your time/distance or any other data.

  EARLY REVIEW.The NordicTrack arrived yesterday.  After reading all the comments about shipping damage I was worried what shape it would be in on arrival. Sure enough the box had significant damage from what appears to be a forklift tine. There was also some secondary tearing/damage. That said, the device itself had no obvious damage so I accepted it from the shipper.Assembly was pretty straightforward with what may be the best set of instructions for assembly I have seen. The only hitch was getting the hydraulic lift into position. That took some work and expletives.Took it for a half-hour test drive and no problems emerged. If no issues arise I may come back and alter the rating upward. Nonetheless, the persistent reports of shipping damage should make one careful to inspect on delivery.

  We wanted a lightweight treadmill and this machine has been a great purchase! My wife and I each run on it daily and it seems able to handle the many miles with no problems so far. Assembly wasnât easy, but it took less than a couple hours. We didnât expect to love iFit but after the one-month trial, we were hooked and signed up for a year. The programs are really interactive and make you want to get in a workout.

  So happy I got a great price on a great treadmill. Have been using it to walk and jog and it is very good. You have to have the app to do a lot more with it, but it can do the basics on it's own. The app is free for a limited time and up to you if you need it longer. Definitely read the manual through or call to find out how you can work it without the app. I will have to do that myself soon.

  Zero starsâthe first one 1 purchased was damaged in transit and never made it to my homeâthe CSR told me they were having problems with it making it through shipmentâthe replacement arrived but even putting it together with a professional gym installer, it was terribly shakey and the bolts stripped just by our hands! It was even unbearable to try and disassemble for return/pick up. Also, please provide your delivery drivers with trucks that have on/off rampsâthey had to unload and eventually reload this extremely heavy item onto a truck bed that was 3 feet high!!!

    Nordictrack gives you the best run for your money
  
",5.0,Suresh Mohan,"Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  We had an older model of Nordictrack that gave us a good run for the money (twenty years). Thought it was time to get a newer model. So when a good deal came up on Amazon we jumped on it. The package was delivered on time, and up two flight of steps! The box was a bit battered and I was apprehensive, but everything inside was intact. Assembly took two people and two evenings, but was straightforward â we watched a couple of Youtube videos and those were very helpful.We didn't turn on iFit. Treadmill started up without it. The treadmill was whisper quiet. And it gave just the right amount of feedback when walking and running. No bounce, no creak. The controls were intuitive and simple. All family members are very happy with the experience and we use it every day. It has only been three months, we hope we wonât need to replace it for another twenty years!

  I really enjoy this treadmill! I share it with my mother-in-law, who uses it for 30 min walks 3 times a week, and my wife, who goes on moderate runs for about 15-20 min twice a week. I use it whenever I can about 2-3 times a week for 20-30 min runs. Don't have any troubles with it. Very easy to calibrate belt since it can move slightly to the left or right, my guess is because we all have different running forms. I enjoyed the iFit trial it's very cool to see different landscapes when you run. Don't think it's worth it to keep the membership though. HR sensor doesn't seem very accurate, but it's okay because we all have fitbits. All in all, good dependable treadmill!

  This is an update to my last review.Very disappointed in this thing. Literally my husband and I used this thing 4 times MAX and it's already broken. The belt, which is already on the treadmill came unaligned. We noticed that it was making a very loud scraping noise. Not much time afterwards, the belt completely folds! It's not even usable anymore. Definitely contacting them directly for at least a replacement. Not worth it!

  Came in damaged. Was a lot of work back-and-forth to get the free parts from Nordictrack. Now I have to disassemble and rebuild. Works good but donât like the iFit having to be activated to make work during the set up process. You should not have to activate a monthly subscription to activate a treadmill. I know itâs free for the month but still not right.

  This is perfect for our needs, it is still well made and with a good motor. All we really wanted it for was walking and changing the resistance when we were ready. We didn't need the video trainers, higher speeds, or any of the much more expensive features we would never use. The only negative is the shipping companies seem to have a penchant for mishandling treadmills. This one came in with the box destroyed, and several broken parts. It was a replacement for another one that arrived in even worse shape. We decided to let Nordictrack replace the parts, and kept this one as everything else was OK, and now that's it is restored, it is just what we were looking for.

  I was really nervous about this purchase because of the negative reviews.  However, Iâm loving it.  I didnât want to spend lots of money on a treadmill and this seemed to be an affordable and sturdy choice.  I didnât need a big screen and all the bells and whistles.  It  has all I need- one touch incline to 10, speed to 10, and distance and heart rate monitoring. At the end of the day,  itâs about the workout.  Iâm extremely happy with the choice.  I had the assembly done through Amazon and the guys were amazing and fast.  I guess I was lucky and didnât have any dents or scratches and all works well!  I say go for it, and get it assembled...itâs worth it!

    Great Treadmill for the Price.
  
",5.0,Steve kelton,"Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2019","









  
  
    
  For the price, this treadmill is worth every penny. I bought this for our home gym so that we donât have to run outside around the block during our HITT workouts (Florida Mosquitoes are terrible here).The package arrived on time. Our carrier called the day before and gave us a 3hr window of when he would show up, they showed up on the earlier side of it. The box wasnât damaged what so ever, the padding inside the box seems to ensure of that as well. We ordered just before Christmas on the 23rd and it arrived on the 29th, so we were worried of the ârush deliveriesâ getting sloppy. Definitely not the case. Assembly took me and my wife about 90min in total and we werenât in any rush. It comes with an Alan Wrench for most screws, but youâll need a Phillips Screwdriver and a wrench for a few of the connections. Other than that, if youâre competent and can follow instructions in order, the assembly shouldnât be hard at all.Once the treadmill was together itâs been pretty awesome. It vibrates a little bit when you really get running on it, but not too bad. Everything works great, the functions on it are great and very useful. It goes up to a 10 speed and also a 10 incline. It has an auxiliary connection to play music from if you choose to do that, obviously if you have an iphone7 or higher youâll need that adapter piece for it. For the price of this treadmill you really canât beat it. We opted to get the warranty on it, but hopefully we wonât need to use it. Better safe than sorry though. I read some reviews of people that got it damaged and couldnât return it because they didnât purchase the warranty. Thankfully that wasnât the case for us. We will get a lot of use out of this machine.

    Good mid-grade treadmill for home use
  
",4.0,Heather McGee,"Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  First, you DO NOT have to register for iFit to use the treadmill - thanks to another reviewer on this thread, you just hold down the blue iFit button for around 20-30 seconds and it will bypass the requirement to register and pay the monthly fee. Now, you will not be able to access the workouts, but if you just want to do your own workout, you don't need to pay the fee. The treadmill was easy to assemble - you really need two people  - it took my husband and I about an hour to set it up. It works great for what I need to do. On my first use, I ran 16 miles on it and it worked just fine - not as fancy as the gym treadmills, but a great price for a sturdy and reliable home treadmill for a decent price. I plan to use it for my very early morning runs or days when I don't want to go outside. I did purchase the three-year warranty for around $80 just in case, but great purchase so far.

  So far, this is the worst experience ever. We have had this treadmill for over a month and have not even been able to use it because it was broken when it arrived. Took forever to get a tech to come out. When he finally did we then continue to assemble it. And of course something else broke. When we called Nordic track they wanted to charge us for the part that broke. Ugh. If it ever gets fixed and assembled then I will hopefully be able to give a better review

  This treadmill is great so far. It has tons of options and the touch screen and iFIT make it seem really high end. My only couple of complaints are really nothing that should deter you from ordering this. However, for review purposes I'll list my minor dislikes anyway. Although this treadmill folds, it doesn't fold completely upright. It still sticks out quite a bit, making it a little bulkier than most foldable treadmills. My husband put this together in about 2 hours while I was at work, he said it wasn't too hard. Although, he did have a time getting the belt to line up perfectly, so that it did not rub the sides. My last annoyance is the plate that is directly in front of your feet when standing on the treadmill. It seems like it should be further back and it's slightly in the way. I think NordicTrack could easily re-position this in future models. These things are truly just personal dislikes. They would in no way cause me to re-think my purchase. I'm very happy with it overall.

  I am very happy with the NordicTrack treadmill.* It is large enough to walk and run comfortably, even with wide steps.* Incline feature feels real and incline range is big enough.* It was easy to assemble, but it takes at least two people to bring it up a flight of stairs as the main component was heavy even before assembly. After assembly, it is quite easy to put in upright position and move around with the wheels.* The trainer programs are awesome! It really gives a sense of completion in your workout. And you get to do all this tours around the world.* Sometimes my 2.4G network has issues, and the treadmill can't connect to the 5G network. I know that this is a problem of my network, but it would be nice to have the additional option.

  I like simple and easy to use treadmills and this one fits that to a T. The only thing itâs missing (for me) is a fan. My last treadmill had a built in fan and that was very handy. But the room I have it set up in has a ceiling fan, so that keeps me cool enough. The incline is quick and easy and the speed adjust really fast, which I like. The deck has a lot of cushion to it. I donât have any pain or aches in my knees or joints and I use it every single day. Iâm a heart patient, so I mainly use it for cardiovascular exercise (45 minutes - 1 hour power walking or light jogging). I donât miss a day of use. So far, so good with this treadmill. I absolutely love the customer service. They sent out a maintenance technician, just to make sure it was set up and the belt was aligned properly, because I wasnât sure about it once we assembled it. I was super appreciative of that.  Itâs a very well built and sturdy treadmill. I really like it.

  I received the machine and spent a fair amount of time setting it up (treadmill) only to find it doesn't ""unlock"" without activating an iFit subscription. This is like the old PC/Windows Apps bundle. I called amazon and there is a hack - press and hold the blue iFit button - on the console - for 10+ seconds and it will ""unlock"" and operate with full functionality.  If you want the iFit features, you can sign up but its not good business practice to force your customers into a subscription after they spent $700 (+) on the machine.

No problems with the unit or navigating the stairwell. The assembly tech came on another day. He was also timely, professional, and did assembly in about an hour-- well within the estimate to do the job. Assembly was perfect. The unit is used by two people primarily walking. It operates well, and quickly adjusts elevation and speed. The controls are easy to read. Haven't used the sound system yet. The shelf holds a book or Kindle. The unit is reasonably quiet. No problems to report. This unit is similar to treadmills I used at fitness centers, but the speed is limited to 10 mph, and elevation to 10% (15% on gym treadmills). This is plenty challenging to raise my heart rate and develop my leg muscles.  I would recommend this product to a home user.

  I went cheap and had to return the thing because it felt unsafe every step I took I felt like it was gonna stop and I was gonna break my ankle. I then bought this machine and it was double the cost of a cheap one but way better quality. I have had this for a few months and put many miles on it. You dont need the membership to use it. Its a great treadmill.

  Great size, not too loud! So I purchased based off of reviews. Was concerned with the ifit and it saying you need to activate to have treadmill work. I did what another reviewer suggested- hold the ifit button down for 15 seconds until the screen changes and you can bypass the ifit activation and need for monthly fee if you choose.Very satisfied with my purchase!I purchased the assembly for $44 and he had it done within 1 hour. My treadmill was delivered Friday and assembled by Sunday.

  I absolutely love this treadmill! I was worried the screen wouldn't be large enough but 10"" is perfect. The Ifit trainers make working out funand it fits well in my small spare room.I would recommend having someone help you put it together. I was able to do most of it myself but needed my husband to help hold it a couple times. I am NOT good at putting things together at all, but watched a YouTube video and was able to complete it in a couple hours.

  The first one we received, which was NEW, came broken. The replacement has similar issues (still made weird noise & assembly was not fitting) .

It had already been a couple months since we had purchased it and I was losing  money with our trainer. The replacement machine itself runs ok. I wish the fan was a bit stronger, and that the speakers were a bit louder. Takes some time for it to ""start"" (on screen). Serves its purpose.

  I have had this treadmill for 2 months now.  Itâs been great to have a safe place to get my walking in.  I did not put it together, my husband did.  It took him about 2ish hours to complete.  Itâs very well made and very easy to use.  The iFit program that came with it for a free month was great.  You do not have to continue the iFit membership to use the treadmill, but itâs a great program, the treadmill syncs to the workout.  If you are running/walking uphill the treadmill automatically adjusts to the terrain of the workout you choose.  I would recommend this Nordic Track because itâs a fairly good value and in 2020 itâs easier to stay inside and workout than to wear a mask outside!

My issue is that you HAVE to create a nordic account & sign up for ""free"" workout plan to get started.  Yes, you can opt out of the ""free"" trial but note that if you will be paying.  Opting out is not as easy as it should be, and honestly speaking it should NOT be a precondition to start using your track.Once you are past this hurdle though, you will love this nordic :)

    Machine Breaks Down

  I would not recommend buying this product if you plan on using it to run on a regular basis.I bought this machine at the beginning of 2018.  Within a month or about 15 uses, the control panel shorted out.  After several days of navigating through customer service and tech support, they sent a reset key and then eventually a replacement console panel (which I spent a couple hours installing) and the unit worked fine.I stopped using the treadmill when the weather got nice.  I resumed using the treadmill when 2019 started.  Within a month or about 15 uses, the console shorted out again.  This time, the treadmill and the replacement console were no longer under warranty.  Customer support offered to send a repairman ($150) to put in a new console ($300).  In summary, the repair would cost almost as much as buying a new unit and would most likely only last another month or two.  Did I want to buy a different Norditrack treadmill?  No thank you.I don't know why my treadmill console shorted out twice each time within one month of use.  I was running 3-5 miles daily, enough to break a sweat.  I suspect liquid may have entered the console through the speaker units.  Whatever the reason, the treadmill does not seem to handle regular use and would caution buyers against purchasing this unit if they plan to use it regularly.

Itâs nice that they have hikes and things to feel like I went outside. The app is AWFUL for picking workouts though. You canât filter and they are by location, not difficulty or time or even activity which just kills me.

As far as for exercise, the machine works well especially it can be integrated with iFit where I can use their exercises and see how others are doing. It gives me a sense motivation.  In terms of Amazon's delivery, it's horrible. It took over three weeks to get the package delivered and I am a prime scriber, supposedly two days or 7 days delivery.

  The arms that mount to the base of my treadmill are crooked. They should be at a 90-degree angle to the base, but they are at an 85-degree angle or so. They mount to the base with 4 bolts each, so this was not a setup error. This was a manufacturer error. When I fold the treadmill up, the right side rubs against the right arm, while the left side has a big space between the track and the arm. A good product overall, but I am disappointed the product is not as it should be.

  PROS: I am picky when it comes to treadmills (I've used many at various gyms and have owned two others), and I love this one! It's very stable and comfortable to run on, the screen is very clear, the touch screen works great, and the sound is good also. ifit is very fun, there are SO many different workouts you can do other than just running (HIIT, yoga, etc) which makes it a versatile machine.  So, i like that there is a lot of different things you can do with this treadmill, which makes it's fun to play with. I look forward to my workouts.CONS: My treadmill came with a broken fan. The fan is very important to me so this has been a major inconvenience. Fortunately, NordicTrack sent me a new fan (free of charge). It took 10 days to get here and I had to install it myself. UNFORTUNATELY, installing the fan myself wasn't an option. The directions were garbage and not for my model specifically, so I have to get a technician to come out and fix it for me. It will be another 3-5 business days until I hear from one to make an appointment. By the time this gets fixed, I will have lost 1 month of my ifit membersip.I was also disappointed that getting the ifit account setup has been difficult. The treadmill came with an activation code that is basically useless...you have to call ifit and they will get you setup. Not a huge inconvenience, but rather an annoyance. I will need to make another phone call to get my husbands account setup.ifit is great, but I do hope to see it improve to make browsing and scheduling workouts much more convenient.All in all, I would recommend this treadmill because it's great. It may take time to get it setup. Hopefully your luck is better than mine.

  Just to be clear, you are not really buying a treadmill so much as you are buying a kit which includes all of the parts required to build a treadmill yourself...it takes about five hours, and is NOT for people who are casual do-it-yourselfers.  Having an extra person on hand helps during certain parts as you will be required to lift and hold the treadmill while screwing in items under it.  Overall use is good and was as expected, but I really think they could have spend a few bucks to have some of this assembly done at the factory.

    If you're a runner, this not the best option
  
",3.0,Chris,"Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  What do I mean by ""runner""?  You'll know who you are.  Anything above 7 mph makes the treadmill rock back and forth, even after multiple adjustments, tightenings, and reallignments.  My water bottle basically rattles back and forth in the built in cup holder for my entire run.  It's not like the treadmill isn't sturdy, but it's not the same experience as a commercial grade treadmill you would find at a gym.Also - THIS TREADMILL CANNOT DISPLAY SPEED IN MINUTES PER MILE, ONLY MPH.  This should be a basic function of any treadmill, so it's really disappointing.  I know I can convert using math, it's just not what I want to do while I'm trying to get through a workout.

  I really love this treadmill, i only had it one week and I'm a fan, is very sturdy it has good workouts, it's very easy to fold and unfold it comes down by itself very strong treadmill, so far I haven't had any problems the only thing I can say is that the front console is missing some features that are shown on the picture, that's the reason why I'm only giving it 4 stars. But other than that it's a great treadmill, also the ifit feature can be override by simply pressing the ifit button for 30 seconds and it will setup to normal. I definitely recommend.

  When we decided to create a small exercise room at our home, I was very ""ify,"" wondering how sturdy a personal treadmill would be (if it wasn't commercial grade---the kind I would use at a professional gym).  I am SO pleased with this treadmill. Ironically, we bought my mom a treadmill about 1 year before, and we purchased a more expensive one for her. When I visited her last, I realized that without a doubt I prefer the one we bought---which cost about $200-$300 less.  It's sturdy, doesn't shake/vibrate when I am on it and feels great.

  The product arrived on time, neatly wrapped, with instructions for assembly.  The assembly took about two hours.  The product worked as advertised. The only mildly negative comment would be that the arms don't come far enough back for the jogger/ runner to grasp, at least in my opinion.  But the positives, especially fitting in a smaller space, are really positive!

    A sturdy, quiet and stable platform.
  
",4.0,John F.,"Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2019","









  
  
    
  This is the first treadmill I've ever owned and I'm glad I went with this brand. It's a solid, well built platform. The information screen and input buttons are conveniently located and easy to read. The added value option of the iFit program is an interesting plus. I have yet to use the iFit program myself as I'm recovering from open-heart surgery but the demos look interesting.As mentioned, I'm recovering from O-H surgery where a Mitral valve was repaired, a bypass graft was installed as well as having a hole between the right and left ventricles repaired. the local Cardiac rehab was going to charge me a co-pay of 50 bux a session with three sessions a week.That equals 150 a week x four weeks a month for three months for a total of 1800 bux. All that for three 30 minute sessions on a treadmill per week. Soooo... I decided to buy my own treadmill and save 1200 bux. Now, I don't have to get myself ready for the day and  drive over to rehab in inclement weather. I just grab my T-shirt, shorts and  running shoes and have at it. As mentioned before, the machine is quiet, built sturdy to last and a stable platform able to accommodate the beginning walker as well as a marathon runner wannabe.My only complaint thus far, is that the pulse meter readout is a bit flaky It flashes BPM in a somewhat erratic fashion. Being a heart patient, this was a feature I truly wanted/needed for my rehabilitation. Perhaps someone at support can walk me through a fix. We'll see. It was this issue that kept me from giving five stars instead of four.Regards,John F.

I wish I knew where the best walking areas are with the trainers for people my age.

Like I said,I am having a hard time finding many places to fit my level.There also is a great Scotland mountain with an older gentleman.

    Best affordable treadmill out there
  
",5.0,Tom Fuller,"Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  I did lots of research to find the top treadmills. This was by far the most affordable. Very easy to set up (extremely heavy though). Works very well. Smooth, quiet. My only concern was that you were forced to register for a $15/month subscription with iFit. Turns out, it is super cool - with walking or running routines with a coach, music, great sites, and it runs your treadmill.Another positive - the treadmill is very quiet. Using it does not disturb others in the house who want to sleep. It feels very sturdy and after using it for five months or so I'm very pleased with its features and performance.

Everything else is intact but what I don't understand is the fact that they package all the heavy stuff on top of the light material. Which in this case caused the board to crack. Contacted the company and after 1 months they finally got back to me. They told me they will send me a replacement part which I'm still waiting till this day. They take for ever to get in contact. The machine runs great. The assembly took some time. But its a good machine.  Hopefully if you get it it will be better packaged. Its the reason I'm giving it 3 stars.

  I would have given this treadmill 5 stars but I cannot stand when my feet hit the front while walking or running. Thatâs the only negative thing I have to say. Other than that, itâs a nice piece of equipment! The buttons are super responsive, and itâs wide/long enough that you donât feel like youâre going to fall off. I just received it today and my husband assembled it for me. I ran for over an hour and did 3 miles. I would buy it again.

  We shopped for a treadmill for a while and ultimately chose this due to price and amenities. I use it almost everyday however am a novice runner and love the ifit program it comes with. The touch screen tv is easy to use and swap back and forth to multiple accounts.The treadmill did start grinding though when it inclines and makes a squeak sound.  I was surprised bc itâs not that old. We need to call and get it serviced after the pandemic.Regarding ifit- there are so many programs to follow for both on and off the treadmill and for all fitness levels.  Thereâs supposed to be a live trainer/class feature but I canât find any information on it. Regardless this is a great machine for the money!

  This treadmill is very awesome. Our whole family loves to use it. It is a great warmup for workouts. The assembly is okay. As long as you follow the directions really well, it is pretty easy to assemble. We had a few troubles during the process, but we could still fix it. Overall the assembly is as great as the whole treadmill. I love that it has workouts that are designed to burn a number of calories because you can know how much calories you burned. Using it  is really easy. Everything works great and nothing is not working. The one thing that bothers me is that they tell you to download an app but you really don't need to. You just need to plug in the key and hold the iFit button for about ten seconds.  Overall the treadmill is GREAT. Everything works fine and I suggest anyone to buy it.

  I bought this treadmill after trying out the NordicTrack my daughter bought. This purchase also came just before the Covid19 shutdown of gyms occurred. It is a very sturdy product and is probably more than I need but will be used continuously by other family members when the weather keeps us indoors which is 6 months out of the year where I live. There are many choices on this machine for incline, speed and workouts for those who do more intense activity. And I don't plan on using it for laundry...LOL

  Bought this treadmill so I could stay active while I was quarantine-ing. I'm a big guy 6' 280lbs and I was a little concerned about it handling my weight. No such concerns after I got it unpacked and assembled. Solid frame and decking. Nice layout for the controls. I opted for this model because I didn't need the large fancy display that costs the extra $200. I just needed a tread mill that will go. No problems with the belt sticking which can be a problem for bigger guys. Fairly easy to assemble. Been on it for a month now with no issues, using it any where from 30  minutes to an hour and a half a day. Incline is nice, goes to 10% which is more than enough. Treadmill doesn't move. Currently on a tile floor and hasn't slipped a bit. Easily lifts up with piston system and comes down slowly and under control with same piston, will not crash down. Easily worth the price paid.

I would have given it 5 stars if the panel was more advanced but I use it with the Peloton app instead of IFit and it is perfect for that. Do not sign up for iFit unless you really want to.

  I bought this treadmill after looking at other similarly priced treadmills. Of the others at this price point, this one had overall the best reviews and features that I was looking for. I was looking for a treadmill that could go at least up to 10 mph, and 10 elevation grades with quick buttons on the interface for each level. I usually do HIIT sprints and wanted something that was easily transitional from high to low speeds, along with elevation gradient increase. This had all of these, and is also very sturdy given me sprinting at 10mph (5'8"" 175lbs). Overall decently priced for what you get. The only thing that was a little bit difficult was assembly which I did alone. While not impossible, It's definitely not easy. Additionally one of the screws they sent was wrong, but I contacted customer service and they sent me another one in the mail.

  I really liked this treadmill (T 6.5 s) and thought I was buying quality. Until yesterday when the track motor stopped functioning. I did not buy the extended warranty, I never do when I think I'm buying a quality product. A call to Nordictrack and I learned that a service call is $150 just to determine the problem. The repairman does not stock parts so the second service call to actually fix the darn thing is another $60 plus the cost of any parts which could be 100s of dollars, I don't know. All this for a $600 price (delivered) treadmill. It only lasted 18 months of fairly light use.VERY SORRY I BOUGHT THIS PIECE OF JUNK AND WILL NOT THROW GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD.

  I had a rough start with the treadmill. Upon assembly it appeared as if the console (crossbar) was not a fit for the rest of the treadmill body as it seemed a few inches too short. I saw another review stating something similar and was very disappointed. Amazon support was super responsive and was ready to ship me another unit. Meanwhile I got in touch with NordicTrack (through the online form), and they were super responsive as well. Within a couple of days I was FaceTiming with Kay Lynne, an extremely helpful employee who walked me through the finer points of the assembly. In short, it was critical to loosen some key screws before connecting the crossbar (and console). After that, the assembly went smoothly!The treadmill works great and it's sturdy, the price is great. I disabled iFit by pressing the iFit button for ca. 20 seconds (make sure the magnetic key is attached while you do this).

  I love this treadmill.  We have had it for about 2 months.  I was able to assemble nearly all of it by myself, in about an hour.  We used the free iFit membership for one month, but decided that the included features (pre-programmed workouts, and space for an iPad to watch other videos or listen to music) were enough for us.  I run on it nearly every day, and have had no issues- the convenience of having the treadmill during winter cannot be overstated.  The screen is bright and easy to read, and it is very easy to switch speeds or inclines.  The interface with iFit was also great when we used it, and I'd recommend it for those who want that extra motivation or to change up the workouts / scenery / coaching each time.The only downside is that there is no pace info (miles per minute) on the display, but through time I've learned what the speeds (in mph) are for my goal paces.

  For one, the iFit thing in general is a scam.  If I didn't see the workaround in other reviews, I wouldn't have been able to start up my treadmill in the first place since it didn't come with a card and a code.  I even made an iFit account before I discovered that and had to confirm my cancellation about fifteen times before it finally let me.  I got in a good half mile run to test the waters and it was nice and quiet despite being on the highest possible settings.  I turned it on the next morning only for the display to light up and go out entirely.  I tried turning it off and back on.  I even tried unplugging it while in the off position, then turning it back on, but nothing.  I literally got half a mile's worth of use before running into my first major problem.

  It's great for me (80 yrs old).  Just wanted it for slow to medium walking when it's too hot or cold outside.  It's great for that.  Since it was relatively inexpensive and I had someone to assemble it for me (took him 3 1/2 hrs),  I bought it.  And I'm not sorry.  I wouldn't recommend it for a young athlete who wants to run very fast.  It can go fast, my grandson tried it.  But it shakes a lot at high speeds.

The treadmill itself is super sturdy, I love being able to get off the sofa and walk two feet and be able to work out while I'm still able to watch TV. It's super quiet as I keep opposite hours of the house and it doesn't wait anyone up when I turn it on. I, actually, like the iFit feature on it; but you don't have to have it in order for the machine to work. Please see other posts about bypassing that option.

There is a weird screeching sound that comes and goes, so hopefully that's not a sign of issues to come, but aside from that my only complaint is how slow it is to get the unit from a point of powered off to the point where I can start running.  It takes a while to boot up from pressing the power button, then I have to press ""continue without signing in"", then ""manual start"", and by the time I'm actually running it usually burns about 2 or 3 minutes of my lunch break.  I could just leave it powered on between uses, however, the display remains on and I imagine that over time that may wear it down so I'd prefer to leave it off.

  I ordered this to use during the winter so I could keep on a regular exercise schedule.  I did utilize Amazon's service to bring it in and set up.

I just like to walk for a substantial timeframe either reading or watching TV while doing so.  This machine allows me to do all of that without having to spend money on a gym and going outside in the winter at 5:00 am.  Also with the COVID-19 stay at home,  I was still able to walk everyday.  Don't plan on using the machine for heavy duty running as it is definitely not built for that, but for walking or a light run, it works well.

We love this...havenât been to the gym because of covid so this is a really, really good machine for home use. It is pretty sturdy & is handling my 4â 11â, 100 lbs walk/run on it while also handling my boyfriendâs 6â, 185 lbs of running on it. Itâs only been a few months so weâll see how long it lasts. We got it for $800 total...a good price for a machine this size. Delivery was a bit rough..box was broken up a bit & I was worried it was damaged but the packaging held up. No marks etc.

  I had paid extra for to-room delivery of the package because as a 59 yo who is 5 months out of open heart surgery, wrestling a 287lb box up 14 stair is ill-advised. Unfortunately, a series of failures to communicate from the delivery side meant that the package had to sit in my entryway for a week until I could arrange for help.Once the package was in the room, it only took me about 6 hours to unpack and assemble the treadmill, since long experience has taught me to triple check my understanding and performance of the instructions.Once assembled, I had trouble starting the unit until I realized that I didn't have the safety key engaged ;-) Once that was done, everything started working fine and 5 weeks later I'm very pleased with treadmill!

  This is a really good treadmill. We purchased it because with Covid, going to the gym is no longer possible. So, we brought the gym home to us! We love the iFit features:10 inch screen, the library of walks and hikes and the variety of different trainer. It keeps it fresh every day! If you are going to put it together yourself, you will need two people at some point, because it can be very heavy. But, all in all the directions were very clear and it was very easy to put together as long as you follow those directions. We have had to call the service number for a couple of parts that needed to be replaced due to damage during shipping, but the service was excellent and the parts were replaced very quickly. We are very happy with this purchase! Highly recommended!

  This treadmill was purchased in response to quarantine orders due to COVID-19.  It's a good name, it was a great price and had the features we needed.  For us, it works as expected.  However, I would not recommend using the treadmill for anything under 1.5 MPH.  At that pace, the treadmill is jerky, and only gets worse as you slow down.  So, if you are ok going 1.5MPH or faster and can do your own cool-down, it works well.

  Plastered all of the treadmill and instructions is that you must go to ifit.com/activate just to turn the thing on.  Of course, there is nothing telling you prior to purchase about this. You cant turn the thing on until you register and buy a membership!  So anyhow, I spent a half hour waiting for customer support gave me a work around.  (hold the ifit button down for 20-30 seconds with the key in) The real issue is that everything to this point is requiring you to give them your credit card to sign up for automated billing.  There is no opt out or any indication of the instructions above anywhere in the documentation.  This is a horrible way to do business.  I'd be OK with opting in but they chose not to do that instead wasting my time and yours if you buy it.

  I would have given this over all 4  or 5 stars but it came very damaged due to shipping. Not packed well and box had several holes. Then upon opening a few of the plastic parts were broken or cracked. The speaker has a gash at top. None of these effect performance so I am contacting NT to see about replacement parts for broken pieces. Assembly was not real intuitive. Over all plastic pieces are very flimsy compared to my older NT. However actual workout performance is good. I havenât tried speaker yet and will not be using ifit so I bypassed it when activating. They should tell you off the bat you can bypass by simply starting, put in safety clip, then hold down ifit button until it beeps and sets track.

  The only issue I had was the delivery.  It looked like it had been through a war and back when I got the box.  But luckily the packing to keep everything safe worked really well.  The box was extremely beat up though.  We were able to assemble with no problem though.  She works like a dream.  I really enjoy using this treadmill.  There is a work around if you don't want to use the iFit option....  Luckily someone posted it earlier.  The speakers could be a bit louder to be heard over the treadmill itself.  I would advise using head phones to help being able to hear what you're using to entertain yourself in your workout.  I would get a better clip for the magnet.  The clip that's on there is a bit cheaply made and cumbersome to put on your clothing.

  We ordered and had the NordicTrack T Series 6.5SI during the COVID-19 outbreak so it was delivered to our door. We were not able to get assistance with putting it together, much less getting it up our stairs. The package is very heavy so beware. The treadmill itself was not terribly difficult. It took us about 4 hours to put together.After assembly everything was a breeze. The treadmill is very sturdy and feels like a high quality machine. It runs very smooth and is respectably quite. I would also mention that it comes with a 10 inch tablet screen that is much bigger than in the pictures. We were torn between this model and the next step, the 8.5 with a 14inch screen and a built in fan. But for us, casual walkers/runners looking to be more healthy; it was perfect!

  I love this. I bought it because my gym closed because of covid-19. Itâs comfortable, but not like the ones at my gym. It seems like it runs faster than the speed it displays. Either way, at this time, I feel lucky to have a treadmill that is not gym quality, but definitely better than most. The iFit app is free for the year and I really enjoy it. Buy the extra protection plan if you workout daily. Itâs well worth it.

  Bought this treadmill last weekend. There was issues with shipping since the first one apparently got lost so another one was ordered. Once it arrived and opened it, it was really annoying to see scratches on the treadmill. If it comes new it should come new. Also find it irritating how 4 days after purchasing it, they drop the price almost $200 dollars on it which is very annoying. Overall decent treadmill, I did not sign up for the ifit thing. Even though it has signs all over it saying you have to register on the site itâs all lies. One you hold down the blue button for 30 seconds after turning it on and pressing start, the tredmill works. Find it interesting how they try to make you purchase the ifit thing or else your tredmill wonât work is all a lie.

  My wife and I (both in mid 60's) had it assembled in about two hours.  Once assembled it's pretty heavy and awkward to move, so put it together close to where you'll use it. Seems solid and stable. My only complaints would be that the motor is pretty whiny,  and it's hard to get a good pulse reading without constantly re-gripping the contacts. If it holds up it'll be worth the money.

  Assembly was cumbersome, but once it is put together it functioned fine. Some of the plastic external (aesthetic) components didnât quite align, but that could have been my fault. It can take a minute or two to boot up if you turned it off. It jerks a bit when the tread starts moving. When running on treadmills, I normally just his âstartâ and then set a speed and go, but on this treadmill you have to cancel out of the automatic âwarm upâ that it has as a default. Not a big deal, just a couple of extra seconds and steps at the beginning that I would prefer to avoid.

My wife mainly walks on it for an hour straight and she gets a good workout with it especially at full incline. It's a great investment towards our health and fitness. You get a gym feel workout right at home for your own convenience and it doesn't run down your wallet too with the power consumption which is a huge plus. It stores up pretty nicely as well so it won't take up a lot of space. I was pleasantly surprised at how quiet it runs too.If you're thinking of buying this, don't hesitate with this treadmill.

  The machine did not work after several hours of assembling (quite a few screws not fit well).  Very disappointed especially a brand new machine. Then we called the technical support and was told that the problem could be the motor. The technician ordered us a new motor. About two weeks later we received the motor and installed it (which also took us couple hours replacing the motor). The machine still not working and we called the technical support again and this time was told it might be the control board problem. As far as today we are still waiting for the control board to be delivered and hope the problem can be fixed. We ordered the treadmill around Christmas and expected it being a great gift, never thought it is a defect.

  I absolutely love this treadmill.  The assembly was pretty straightforward.  The parts (aka nuts and bolts) were packaged individually and labeled according to which step they are used, which takes the guessing out of everything.  The most difficult part was putting the hydraulic piece that holds it upright, so I recommend having a second person to help.  As far as ease of use, it was very easy to set up a profile on iFit and this purchase included a one-year subscription.  There are several workouts to select.  I prefer running, and I have been able to run in places I would never really be able to go and see the area and with trainer-led workouts, they have so much knowledge about fitness and well-being, but also the areas where they run.  I would highly recommend this treadmill.

  Iâve had my treadmill for almost a year. So far so good.  I typically run on speeds 4-5 mph and I havenât had issues there. Iâve encountered two issues this far.  I used the incline twice.  During the usage it was fine. The next time I went to use it after the incline, the treadmill would continually incline and decline on its own for about 5 minutes.  My second issue happens occasionally.  An hour into my runs, the treadmill belt  sometimes feels as though it pauses. It doesnât happen all of the time but enough that Iâve  noticed. I live in an apt so my favorite thing is that the treadmill is pretty quiet.

  I had to pay someone to put this together for me because my assembly skills are nonexistent. It took the guy over 2 hours so I would say it does require some elbow grease. It works well but there is literally no cushion on this treadmill. I am used to the treadmill at my boutique gym that is very bouncy which was great for my bad knees and weak shins. Since this machine is like running on concrete, it aggrevated my shins like crazy. I had to order some different shoes to specifically use when on this treadmill. Once I did that, I've not had issues so I would still recommend this machine. And I agree with other reviews that you can easily bypass the iFit subscription and use it in manual mode.

  My only regret is that I waited so long to finally get this. You need 2 people to put it together for sure. There were some curse words and threats of moving out, but we made it. I never thought I'd subscribe to iFit but with membership included I am able to try it out. I love it and will likely pay for membership. Treadmill is great. Worth paying extra for the bigger screen. Love that I can bluetooth my music over the speakers.

",3.0,Kris E.,"Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  The machine seems solid, but one of the main reasons I bought this particular one was for the interactive online workouts; however, when I entered my code from the card in the box, I was told that the membership had already been redeemed and I could not activate.  I contacted support via their chat system and then was told that they were unavailable until Monday (this was on a Saturday).  Monday came and went with no response.  Just reached out again via the same system and again it says that they are offline (even though I am within the hours that they say they are available).  Anyway, if the online experience is a big part of what you're looking for, look at something else as I now have to decide if I want to go through the hassle of returning this thing.

  I bought this treadmill for runs during the winter. It took about 3 hours for me and my dad to set it up, you need two people to set it up yourself. It's easy to fold up but it's a little heavy but that's to be expected because it's a treadmill not a yoga mat. I would recommend this treadmill to anyone who is going to use it for running or walking. I didn't do the ifit subscription so I can't talk about that but if you want a treadmill to run on without all the bells and whistles this is the treadmill for you!

  For those sifting through all the contradicting Q&A: no, this treadmill is not made in Utah (USA). It's made in China.The instruction manual can be rather vague sometimes.The activation process was annoying. Why do I need to activate something that I should be able to just plug in and go, especially after spending all that money? They make you sign up with ifit.com which wants your credit card. The website is flakey and hard to navigate on Chrome for Android and you have to manually cancel a subscription in order to avoid monthly billing.I really regret buying this.

  Purchased this treadmill about 3 months ago as a replacement/upgrade for a much older unit.  Two mid-distance runners/hikers (avg. 5 miles per day each) use this machine on a daily basis and it is holding up very well.  The treadmill itself is very sturdy and has proven to be easy to fold when needed to save space in the home gym.  The tablet/iFit features are very useful and the different programs help to break the monotony when distance training.The assembly was a bit of a bear but nothing too strenuous; it did require two people for some steps.Overall no complaints, well worth the price (especially considering the included 1 year iFit membership).  Would definitely purchase again.

  Once I built this I noticed none of the buttons worked except the speed controls. I read other reviews that said you could bypass the iFit, but the Bluetooth button you need to hold to bypass wasn't responding. I figured this was just that the iFit was locking the treadmill so I signed up for iFit reluctantly. After that my phone connected to the treadmill and unlocked it, but still the buttons other than the speed ones did not work. So I think I received a faulty control board. Was such a pain to work through the iFit that I would not buy EVER again even if the buttons did work as intended.... One of the most deceptive marketing techniques ever and should be illegal.

  I'm now on day three of the assembly process. Besides poorly diagrammed and worded directions, there seems to be a major quality issue. Most of the predrilled holes will not accepted the screws and bolts supplied. The shipping box said it was made in China, which could explain the problem, or it could be poor engineering by the company.It certainly doesn't appear to be usable if I complete the assembly given its current state of wobbliness. I have been a purchaser of NorticTrack products in the past but this unit and its poor construction is a deterrent to future purchases. Now on to customer service. I hope that wasn't outsourced to China. More details to follow. I'm hopeful customer service will come through.

I did quite a bit of research looking for the best treadmill at the best price and I am not disappointed.  I have especially enjoyed ifit - the exercise app that comes installed on the NordicTrack.  I have gone running all over the world with a variety of coaches.  It really helps take the grind out of a long run on a treadmill.  So far the NordicTrack has functioned flawlessly.

    Buyer Beware: No Expert Assembly!

  I would have rated this treadmill much higher but I did not receive the expert assembly that I selected when I made my purchase. Thankfully it was a free option because if I paid for the expert assembly and didn't receive it I would be pretty livid. And luckily my husband was able to assemble it for me. This beast of a treadmill weighs 200lbs and can be tricky, (we had to take a door off the hinges to fit it in a particular room) so make sure you have at least two able-bodied people around to assemble it and do not count on the expert assembly. With that being said, the treadmill is great quality and perfect for my needs. It also has this pretty neat hydraulic mechanism that allows it to easily unfold from the upright position. You just press on the bar underneath and it sort of slowly falls into place. And it appears to be able to take a beating as well. My husband is a little over 200lbs and he ran on it at it's top speed of 10 and it was able to handle it just fine. My only gripe about it is that it's very large so if space is limited this may be an issue for you, even when folded up and the speakers are very basic. Best to use earbuds if music is important to you during your workout.

  Living in a climate where fifteen minutes is the difference between sunshine and pouring rain means that a treadmill is a must for working out and the NordicTrack 6.5Si delivers. It connects easily with both iPad and Android phone via bluetooth for guided runs by iFit trainers, and has both the speed and incline to make a self-guided workout a challenge.I took a star off of my review due to issues with the HR monitor bar. I've never experienced a treadmill on which the HR monitor bar actually worked, so this isn't an outlier, nor should it be a deal breaker, but the bar on the 6.5Si will read a HR out of the moisture in the air in the room. It has not once reflected an accurate HR either being held or just left alone.

  There's nothing fancy about this treadmill, but it works great for basic running/walking.  We did not sign up for any of the iFit features.

The only complaint is the heart rate monitor is a little touchy, meaning you have to have your hands positioned just right to get a reading.  It doesn't bother us much.The one thing I love is the ease of lifting the track up and down for storage.  It's very simple and light.  Assembly is possible with one person, but it gets a little challenging on a couple parts.If you're looking for a simple, no frills treadmill, I highly recommend this one.

  After researching and reading reviews I settled on this Nordictrack treadmill for my home gym. I have had it about a month now and I love it! Both my daughter and I use it daily and it works great! I absolutely love the iFit classes and trainers. Iâm so glad I bought this treadmill. We did pay extra for in room delivery and install which was also well worth it our installer was very quick professional and helpful.

  This treadmill is very high quality especially given the low price we paid. It was much better than I was expecting. When I was researching I found the price range for treadmills all over the board. Some treadmills run into the thousands and didn't seem to have features that were worth the extra  money at least to us. We just wanted a basic treadmill but this is so much more. The installed programs have some challenging options which my family uses. I prefer to use my own manual settings. Either way gives a very good workout. We are very happy with our purchase.

  This is the first time I am writing a review on any product I purchased. I am writing this because I am extremely disappointed with this purchase.  Non of the screws that came with it are of right size. It has been 3 weeks and I have not been able to assemble it yet. When I started assembling, I realized one of the screws was defective. I requested a replacement, which I got in about 10 days but they ended up sending a wrong one. After complaining I received a right size one after about 5 days. Then I proceed the next step of assembling. Then I realized that another set of screws were also not right. Now they are sending me the whole set of new screws. Terrible product and terrible customer service.

  For the money, this treadmill is a great investment.  I've had it for about 4 months, and I have had no issues with how the treadmill performs.  It isn't fancy (no video screen, etc. - but if you just watch Netflix on your phone anyway, who cares?), but it is very sturdy.  It is more than adequate for a moderate exerciser like myself.  I'm not putting 10 miles per day on it, but for 30 min. runs a few times a week, it seems like it will stand the test of time.On the negative side - it is VERY heavy (probably why it's so sturdy), and it wasn't super-easy to put together.  Assembly may require 2 people, and I would not recommend moving this beast up or down stairs upon delivery (or purchase the option where someone will set it up for you).  Aside from that, for the price, it's a great deal.

  Exceeded expectations. This has a smooth consistent feel when walking across it. It also comes with a lot of workouts to choose from. It's also comes with a built in touch screen that allows me to easily choose what route I want to go and what workout I want to complete. This is very cushioned because of the Flexselect cushioning system which I really lov. But the great thing about the flexselect system you can choose your cushioning level so if you do not want cushioning you can select no cushioning to make it feel like your outdoor running. It also fold up saving space.

I will admit, it did have a crack in it on the side from shipping but I am honestly so happy with the treadmill. It is steady and firm. There is a huge front piece with controls and handles but it is the perfect size treadmill to fit in a small place at the same time. It was the only good treadmill I have found that had the wide running belt. I hate narrow ones where my feet touches the sides!

  This product is not suitable and was a waste of money.After assembly the incline feature did not function. The manufacturer was insistent that I not contact Amazon for a replacement and instead proceeded to send a new part for me to install, which did not work. After a second contact they sent another replacement part for the entire incline motor, which did not work. They did not offer to send a technician and their customer service is not satisfactory. As this is an expensive piece of equipment I am continuing to try to troubleshoot and I am giving NordicTrack until the end of the month to provide a workable treadmill. If they can fix this issue I will possibly update my review. Until that time BUYER BEWARE.

And if I want to challenge myself I can push it to speed level 10 which is more then enough for me. For average runner, this machine is perfect.. cons - the only minor issue I have with this product is, the belt keeps sliding to left edge. You can adjust that with Allen key which I did but after some use it does that again.

",1.0,Heather Noland,"Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2019","









  
  
    
  This treadmill seems to work well enough and, as expected, was very difficult to assemble. Before use you have to sign up with a service called iFit, wherein you are required to start a free trial and provide credit card information. Beware that once you select ""start trial"" you give iFit permissions to automatically bill your account once the trial has expired. All this was very frustrating because I was not able to immediately cancel my membership. I went through the motions on their website and app just to have the page freeze before finalizing the cancellation. I wasn't able to continue with ending the membership until I spoke with a representative during iFit's business hours. These types of transactions are very sketchy. Had I known this is what I'd be facing after a long day of assembly, I would have purchased a different piece of equipment.

  I had high expectations for this treadmill. I had thoroughly researched a few of them and I decided to go with this NordicTrack because of the generally positive reviews.Unfortunately, my unboxing experience was quite unpleasant at first. Even though we applied extra care when removing the items from the box, we could hear some broken lose pieces falling from the belt back down to the box as we were lifting it.The first impression, therefore, was that it felt âcheapâ. The right side bar (foot rest next to the belt itself) was shattered in various locations, causing it to completely unatach from the belt. The screws that kept it together tore apart. This also caused the front âshellâ that covers the motor to detach on the right side of the belt. So yeah, things felt a little lose.With some patience I applied some super glue to the little pieces that could be reattached, but it wasnât feasible to do so with all the pieces. Iâll have to see how to continue it fix those issues.We still went ahead and finished assembling- good news is that the treadmill did turn on!! That was one huge worry we had given all the hard work we put in to asssemble it.The attached pictures are just some of the broken pieces.It is a little noisy, but I think I could live with that.Now itâs there. Already set up. Now Iâm afraid to use it because of the lingering fear itâll continue to break. Kind of an unhappy customer here...

  Assembly was not as involved as anticipated, it was rather simple. The machine is heavy, well built with a sleek design.Also surprising is how quiet it runs, maybe I was just use to my old machine being loud, this motor purrs in comparison.If you are looking for a quality treadmill with a good price this should work for you. I rarely exceed 4.5 mph so I can not attest to the running performance, but from what I have seen this should do well.

It runs smoothly and looks like it will be a great addition for our light cardio (walking for my lovely bride and jogging for me).

It took me and my husband about 2 hours to assemble, lots of screwing but follow the manual and its pretty smooth, needs atleast two people to assemble. We have been using it for walking and light running and its been good so far. I am happy with the purchase.

  I  was hesitant about buying this but decided to take a risk anyway. Somebody assembled it for me and it was worth it since I would never have been able to. If you press down on the iFit button for 30 seconds, you don't have to activate the treadmill but I'm sure you knew that from the other comments.I can walk and run  8 mph without a problem. It is noisy when I run but it's not a huge problem since I listen to music. I wish there was a pause button instead of just slowing down . Overall, I can walk and run on it just fine and it will come in handy during the winter when its too cold to go out.

  Very reasonably priced and good quality for the price.  Assembling instructions are clear, though it is an involved process.  Easily foldable and overall a good size for running (I run 5-6 miles a day on it).  Because it has a smaller motor than the elite models, it can be loud at times, but keeping the belt lubricated helps, and the price is worth it.  It's very comfortable to run on, and you can change how much give the running deck has with the shocks on the sides.  Overall, I would highly recommend!

  Overall a quiet treadmill.  Very smooth and does give you a good workout.  Also has a good ""shoulder"" to place your iPad or Fire to watch a video while working out.  I wish the side arms were longer.  You really need to be running/jogging quite far from the display to prevent your feet from banging on to the front of the treadmill.  Big disadvantage if you want to hold on to the side arms while walking.  Not an issue if you are jogging or walking.  Wish they had a USB port for charging.  How difficult is that?  The 3.5 mm audio adapter never got used.  I rather have in-ear headphones while I am jogging!

  We were hesitant to buy a treadmill in the first place. We worried we would use for a short while, and then it would collect dust. This has not been the case, however. My wife and I use the machine every day between the two of us now. The machine is solid, and the incline feature is probably the best part. We are not runners, so walking at an incline was a great way for us to burn more calories in a manageable way. I also have enjoyed the 1 free year of iFit. The guided workouts help me stay motivated to keep exercising. Every month weâve seen progress in our fitness and now I am able to run 2-3 miles, which for me is a huge accomplishment. As long as the machine continues to hold up, we are very satisfied with this purchase and would recommend to others.

  The treadmill came with a cable loose internally, I would not have minded attempting to repair it but seems to have no way of opening the inside of the console. The treadmill in its ânewâ condition came with one of its core functions (the Start/Stop buttons) to not work at all. The plate where these buttons are located is loose as well, leading me to find the disconnected ribbon cable thatâs meant to connect to the main console, it shouldâve at least given us a way to remove the back rather than to close off the whole thing, only way to stop it now is to remove the key.

  Since the gym is still closed, and I love running, this treadmill helps a lot.  I ran outdoor and indoor.  And easy to assemble, and saving a lot of spaces (I have a small exercise area) and I love that it tracks my progress every day.Good stuff!! Good Products!

    Good value, but...

  I really want to like this treadmill. I got mad right after the install because it wanted me to suscribe online to a fitness membership. I looked online and found a video on how to bypass that feature. At low speeds, the motor doesnât run smooth. Once youâre above 4mph, it gets better. Other than that, itâs a really good value when comparing it to other treadmills in the same price range. Install is pretty straightforward. Only issue there was mounting the bar that holds the monitor/button board. You have to loose the âvertical legsâ where itâs screwed onto.

  The only negative comment I have on putting this treadmill together is that not all of the screw/bolt holes were bored and had to do some of that myself. I am thankful for having access to those boring tools, otherwise it would have been a lot harder for install. Otherwise the instructions were clear, all of the tools were included and I am very happy with the purchase.

  The belt is plenty big to walk or run. The power incline is great and there are several challenging workouts to keep me working hard. It said the unit was locked until I signed up for ifit but this isnât true all you have to do is hold the ifit button for 30 seconds and it unlocks the treadmill for regular use.  Iâm 6 ft 240 lbs and there is no issue with the weight or stride length. All around a good buy

  Â Really like this treadmill and it seems like a solid product thus far. However, be prepared for a lame experience if you need to have their support help you.  Reported an issue (see attatched video) and was told I'd hear back from a tech in 3 to 5 business days...its been 3 more emails and over a month later with no further replies from them.  (The video shows what happens when you go past level 8 incline and come back down). Would have given this a 5 if it wasn't for my support experience.

  The product arrived in the box, but it is locked with an activation code necessary to start using.

There is no customer support, It is absolutely impossible to contact a human for resolution, all answers are computer generated and the phone number is endless hold, so It looks like it has to be returned. If you buy this be sure to check that the card with the code on it is included before assembling. This is beyond frustrating

  My husband and I are in our 70s. We used to go to the gym several times a week to use their treadmills but the pandemic put an end to that. We decided to purchase a NordicTrack treadmill for personal use and we're glad we did.Our T Series treadmill is quiet and consistent. It's big enough to feel sturdy and small enough to fit comfortably in our finished basement. We had it professionally installed and we use it daily. It's held up well so far and every indication is that it will continue to do so for many years to come.

",1.0,Buyer's Remorse,"Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2019","









  
  
    
  To be clear, this was not a treadmill I bought, it was a paperweight.  If you buy the treadmill and an IFIT membership, then you have a treadmill.  It is the same if you bought a car, but you can't turn it on unless you goht a service like OnStar.  Any comments that suggest you can start up or in anyway use the treadmill without first getting an IFIT membership are incorrect.  You have to register, give them your credit card, etc.  Also to be clear, you can't contact them with a question until you first register with IFIT.  I tried the phone number in the front of the NordicTrack owners manual and was told by the computer that they didn't recognize my phone number as being registered with IFIT so they couldn't take my call (both companies are owned by ICON.)

A few minor issues were that it was very heavy and took me and my husband to lift the box, it took my husband about 3 hours to put together and it was not easy, missing a small cosmetic part but Amazon gave me a partial refund if I would keep it which I was fine with, plastic protective lining separated (most likely from being in a hot warehouse and truck) and it left some residue on the screen.

  I am impressed with all elements of this treadmill purchase.  Quality of the machine, features and functionality, price, and affordable white-glove delivery.  I strongly recommend the affordable optional 'room of your selection delivery' as the box is extremely heavy even for two adults.  Assembly takes a little time, but is easily self performed.  This is a great value and I strongly recommend it.

  My husband and I needed to get exercise indoors. We were skeptical of buying a treadmill again. This one comes with a screen and iFit workouts with trainers. We went on 15 Grand Canyon hikes, hikes in Costa Rica and the Alps And took tours of many cities. I am convinced that this machine saved my sanity. It is easy to use, quiet and sturdy. I use it 1-2 times a day and do not get bored : )

  Over all a nice treadmill, easy to fold up but not as easy to move back toward a wall even with the wheels.  If you dont join IFit and just do manual sessions you can't save your statistics.  I usually read on my tablet however there is no USB hub to keep it charged. Fairly large can't move it to another room unless you take it apart.

  Cannot operate until you log-in with ifit.com, the website is extremely unfriendly. Tried to register my treadmill for the warranty, but I needed an invitation code to register, never received the code when I purchased the treadmill. Had to call the customer service phone number, line was busy and left number for call back.  Was called in in approx 3 hours, then placed on hold again for approx 10 minutes.  I finally talked with a customer service rep, Phyliss.  She was extremely helpful and had my treadmill up and running within five minutes and she then register my treadmill for me. Customer service is hard to reach, but when you do they are very helpful.  Can't say enough about Phyliss.

  Fantastic treadmill! More than my husband and I wanted to pay but well worth it. He did the assembly and said it took a while considering he was one person doing it all, but the instructions were straightforward. It was also easy to move on the wheels but it can be heavy, and itâs important to be careful. We live in an apartment and everything was closed for Covid, and we donât live in a safe area to just go out and run around so it was a great investment. Has 10 speed And incline levels and also programmed workouts to try.

  Love this treadmill, great machine for the price. It stays quiet while I am running at speeds usually around 8mph, and is overall a solid way to get a run and workout in. A bit disappointed the speakers are aux in only and no Bluetooth and not very loud, but I just use other speakers in my workout room.The track is a great width and length is good too, at times I wish it was a bit longer but itâs much better than other options.Itâs easy to fold but I never really do it. Assembly was ok.. not hard but takes a bit of time.

  Nice unit took a little while to install but got it done.  I did not like having to give my credit card number to activate the Ifit to enable the unit to work. Don't believe the dot that follows you around the track is 1/4 mile which I would prefer and it doesn't tell what speed per mile you are exercising at a particular pace as my older Nordictrack had which is important to me. Other than that it is a nice unit.

  This treadmill works exactly as I was hoping. I have COPD and need to do a non stressful workout,so being able to set it to different speeds and grades at the push of a button is awesome. The assembly was a little tough for me to do myself due to lifting and breathing issues. Took about 4 hours to assemble because of breaks in between. I would recommend having someone strong and mechanically inclined to put it together. It is well built for the long haul and that being said its really heavy. I have been using it everyday for the last 2 weeks or so and am glad I decided on a quality machine.

  We live in Arizona, where it's often too hot to go for a nice long walk. This Nordic Track is perfect for us, as we can jump on and walk for as long as we want at any time of day. We're not dedicated athletes - this is a great treadmill for simply walking, with sufficient variety of speeds and inclines to keep us happy. The only drawback has been a constant sprinkling of tiny black bits, apparently from the walking belt, that shower the mat at the end of the device. We checked the alignment and then spoke with customer service, who said the problem should clear itself up. We hope so! And meanwhile, we very much enjoy the treadmill and are glad to have made the purchase.

  The treadmill is great for the price. It doesnât have a bunch of high-tech elements to it, but I didnât want those anyway. This is a relatively basic machine for those who want that. My only complaint at this point is that the front of it seems to be a bit elevated (even with the incline at 0), so if I run past a certain MPH, I almost immediately get shin splints. My boyfriend has experienced the same thing. So we arenât able to full out run, but we are able to walk and jog just fine. Overall, a very good treadmill.

  This is one of best treadmills. It is very sturdy and well made. You can bypass the ifit, no need to pay for the program. I use the treadmill with out it. The incline works well, and it is a space saver. It and can be easily folded. It has small wheels to allow moving it. I am so happy we purchased it. I would recommend this treadmill.

  Ordered this for getting into daily walking and this treadmill is great. The integrated iFit is a nice feature as well since it makes working out much more enjoyable and interesting!  This isnât the top of the line machine by any means, but for someone getting back into walking and light running this certainly is a solid machine. I use it primarily for walking and hiking (through iFit) and put over 100 miles on it in the first two months. Assembly wasnât too difficult, however you definitely need to use the included instructions instead of trying to download the manual as I tried to do since there is a slight difference in parts. Also, having another person to help with moving the machine during assembly is recommended. Overall, I would purchase this machine again!

  My treadmill broke after only a few days.  I was able to reach Cust Svc after many tries.  They facetimed the motor and sent me a replacement part.  After 7-10 business days, I received the part and installed it, but this didn't fix the fact that the belt wouldn't run and the incline went up and down continuously and on its own.  I have been on hold with customer service multiple times for over 30 each and have yet to talk to a human.  I am currently awaiting Amazon's intervention.  In the end, I have had the treadmill since July but have only been able to use it for 2-3 weeks.

After giving them all the information including my credit card, they indicated that my unit was activated. I went to my unit and I get the same message.

I tried to call them (yes, on Friday when the treadmill arrived, but ifit is closed the entire weekend). Regardless, may not have been easy to get it going. And then, I read the magic review: hold down the ifit symbol on the machine for 30 seconds, and the machine starts!I would not wanted that ifit membership anyway. Perhaps that is why they want to force you into it, without even informing you! As the other reviewer said, that should be illegal.I will now use the machine, but start off with a bad taste in the mouth about Nordic Track.

I was not able to use it for FOUR MONTHS due to it not shipping with all of the parts required for assembly. Icon was beyond useless and not helpful in the slightest bit. It took at least 15 phone calls and 20 follow up emails and a ton of patience to receive the parts needed to finally use the machine. Once finally assembled, it works fine. Great machine for the price, but I would strongly consider ordering from a different manufacturer to specifically avoid dealing with Icon again.

  I really like the product, I had to assemble it myself so it took my about 3 hours but everything works great on it and I use the membership workout videos and I like it a lot. Only issue is that I am about 260lbs so the belt does slip once in a while when I run but itâs not very often and not enough to bother me, just breaks my rhythm for a split sec, other than that it works great.

  Excellent treadmill, it so hard to find a treadmill that has powered incline and a decent belt width and length. It was fairly simple to put together, The only hard part was moving the darn thing to it's intended spot, the item description says it weighs 193 lbs but it felt much heavier than that, it took 3 guys to move it up the stairs.

  I really like this treadmill. Although I was able to assemble it myself it did take some time to put together. I am glad I got the larger touch screen as it helps when doing the Ifit workouts. Speaking of Ifit, be careful. The enclosed year membership is supposed to be a family membership. Mine showed up on my machine as a single. I spent 30 minutes on hold waiting for Ifit customer service. Once I was able to speak to someone they changed it to a family membership. Not sure if this was truly a mistake or not but they took care of it and away we go!

  I've bought this treadmill around the end of November 2018 and have used it most days, both running and walking, at all levels and it has been running very smoothly so far.  Of course, I weigh 112 pounds, so someone who weighs more may have a different experience.  I wish the arms were longer and the incline higher but for the home and price they're both good.  Unfortunately, Amazon only sent one person to deliver it, which was a problem and they guy, without asking me first, grabbed my neighbor to come into my house to help.  It was not his fault that he didn't have another person, but this was very uncomfortable for me AND my neighbor.  The assembly instructions were pretty clear and if you follow them closely you should have no problem.  I am a 54-year-old female.  I needed help one time when I was attaching the parts underneath and had to have someone hold the base up while I did this, but very doable with two people at the last part and some strength is required.  Overall, I'm very happy with this treadmill.

Dealing with ""iFit"" to get the treadmill unlocked for first usage was a complete pain and was way more complicated than it needed to be. After using treadmill a few times the belt slipped a bit to the right. Support was great at walking me through how to even it back out and since there have been no issues.

  My husband and I did a lot of research on a treadmill before purchasing. We ended up going with this one because it fit our needs. Weâve had it for a few months now and it is great! We use it probably 4-6 times per week between the both of us and it has held up great. We did purchase a mat to go underneath it because we put it on a carpeted floor and it doesnât move at all. It goes up to 10mph and 10 incline. I usually jog at about 6-7mph and so far so good!As others have said with the iFit membership, you just have to hold down the iFit button when you first turn it on and it wonât ask for you to sign up again. No extra expenses at all. I would definitely recommend! Itâs a great value for the price.

  I love the treadmill and the iFit membership is great! So many options available to make working out fun. My biggest negative is that the Amazon installer who assembled the treadmill put the belt on slightly crooked. I thought it would be ok by adjusting the belt using the hex tool as stated in the manual, however, less than 4 months from purchasing the treadmill, the belt ripped on one side and I have to replace the belt. I wish I would have known better and had the installer straighten the belt.

  I was so torn between this treadmill and the Horizon T101 and honestly I decided on this one because of the free delivery and assembly through Amazon. I am so glad I did. The delivery and assembly was painless and quick. There were 3 staff who delivered and they were very knowledgeable on the assembly and even use of the treadmill. They had everything working perfectly and I even tested before they left.The treadmill itself has been perfect and a very smooth walk. I especially use the ledge/shelf for holding the iPad while I walk. My only complaint would be that itâs very heavy to roll for storage.

  The item was delivered pretty banged up. It took 8 hrs for assembly. The threads on bolts and screws were messed up that required a screwing in with a high torque drill bit. Anyways got it done. Big issue is that the belt DOES NOT STAY centered. It loses alignment after each use. I have followed the manufactures direction to center the belt, but still not resolved. Reading reviews here explains that this is a known issue. My bad for not researching before ordering. I am hoping to get a company tech fix the issue. If this is not resolved in the next 30 days, I will return.

  So far, this very expensive treadmill is a useless multihundred pound piece of junk. NordicTrack has diagnosed the issue as ""probably the control board"" so they want to send me a new one and see if that fixes it. This will apparently take 3-4 weeks to be shipped to me at which point a technician will then contact me and take another 2 weeks to schedule an appointment to come and install it and MAYBE then it work. Or maybe then I have to see if Amazon will send a replacement and get this hunk of garbage out of my house. Who knows. Either way, I would suggest this treadmill isn't worth the money ;)

  After coronavirus hit I knew that I needed a treadmill to stay healthy and going to the gym wasn't an option. This treadmill had the best reviews for its price and I totally agree. It does take two people to assemble but the instructions for clear and straight forward and moving it around the house was easy as well (we couldn't decide where to put it at first). It folds up and locks into place for safety and despite its size it packs a punch. I love that it has a decent incline and it goes up to speed 10.If you are looking for a treadmill that does a little bit of everything and is a 5/5 quality, this is it!

We had it assembled by an Amazon contractor who was quite professional and knowledgeable.  The assembler told me he had assembled well over 100 of this model.

Two delivery guys wanted to leave the tredmill in the lobby, because 3 flights of stairs was too much.  My husband had to help one delivery guy bring tredmill to our condo.

  We have had this unit for several months and it's been flawless. We live in Florida and needed an indoor way to exercise. My wife and I use it for walking at various elevations and both enjoy it. We haven't used the pre programmed workouts or other features except for the ipod speakers which are OK. Better to use headphones.Everything in the unit seems well constructed and it's a very good price/ value deal.We bought the assembly through Amazon at a sale price and it was really worthwhile. Prompt efficient service.Our unit came with a cracked plastic base cover pointed out by our assembly guy. I called Amazon and got a very fair adjustment so we went ahead with the assembly.

  I have already lost 2 lbs in the first 5 days of using it so you can burn 500 calories in about 45 minutes each day.I had trouble assembling it but I undid the bottom screws, so that the handle was moveable then I put he console on and tightened every bolt. This is the only way it would fit so do not tighten the bottom all the way until you have secured the top console.

  This treadmill doesnât read your heart rate accurately. When taking mine during a two mile jog I will get 50-70 BPM, which I know is false. I will then have to retake two to three times to get an actual believable hear rate reading. Both my wife and I have experienced this issue, and itâs rather frustrating considering the cost of this unit.

  Due to COVID I had to put the treadmill together myself. Iâll be honest, Iâm not a screw driving and hammer guy.  After 2 1/2 hour this thing was up and almost ready to go.  To start you need to activate online with Norder track (iFit).  Yup a account with debt info and everything.  I didnât it and everything worked.  Iâve used it about 10 time and no problems so far.  Iâm satisfied.

  Great treadmill. This is my first experience with treadmills, so I don't have anything to compare it with. But it does everything we need. We can walk or run at different inclines and speeds. There are built in programs that we can use, but we could also connect to iFit to gain a bunch of others (for a fee). Either way this was a great buy and is still being used.

  My brand new machine arrived with a damaged motor. I spent about 45 minutes online trying to troubleshoot the issue on the Nordic track website to no avail. Then I called customer support. The menu to get to a human is long and cumbersome. If you do not have your model and serial number the electronic system hangs up on you. I reached a customer service rep only to be disconnected and have to dial in through the menu all over again. It took another hour of my time to sort through it with the mobile App allowing customer care to see the machine, circuit board, and motor to determine that it was an issue with a bad motor. Customer care could really use some improvements.

  This NordicTrack treadmill T6.5 is a fantastic replacement for my old ProForm treadmill.  I had that one for 16 years!  Hopefully the NordicTrack will last just as long.  It's extremely quiet, and smooth.  Much quieter than I was expecting. I had some problems with the console, but after contact CS, they sent out a replacement for the console.  Great customer service.  It took a little longer to resolve than I had hoped, but most likely due to the pandemic.  All in all, if you're considering a treadmill, NordicTrack is the way to go.

  The treadmill may be just fine. But a company that holds your product hostage until you give your credit card should be ashamed. I have long heard the name NordicTrack and assumed it to be a reputable company. Guess i was very wrong. I would return it if I didn't already spend the time to assemble it.  When you first turn it on it is disabled. To enable it you must get an app ($15/month) in order to activate. Oh yes you can cancel before the month is over. You MUST enter your credit card to continue. Amazon say you get a year free. You only get 1 month.  I'm sure the app gives additional features. Let me choose then if I want them. Don't force me.

The things wrong with my machine is the speed buttons do not work correctly. For example 7mph shows as 11.2mph on the screen. The heart rate monitor is WAY off. also adjusting the belt is a pain in the neck. There are no notches or labeling and it is in a very awkward spot to adjust. Making it an inexact science to tighten or loosen the belt because you could tighten one side of the belt more than the other.

  So after a week of extensive research on 'best at home treadmills for first time buyers', this is the one I chose. For the price and delivery convenience it is amazing. It will take a couple of hours to put together tho as there are quite a but of screws and wires to thread.

    My First Treadmill

  Got into running this summer and didn't want snow or ice to disrupt my training this winter. I've been running on this when the weather prevents me from going outside now for two months. I wanted a basic treadmill--no LED touchscreens or other bells & whistles--and this fit the bill. It was easy enough to put together with a little help and has worked great! No problems what so ever. My only complaint is that it only reports your speed in mph, whereas minute per mile would be preferred.

  Whatâs not to like? My gym has been closed for six months with no end in sight. I was afraid I would not be able to get a treadmill but Amazon came through again. Itâs been a life saver.It did take a little extra effort to set it up. I did mine in the driveway as you need a lot of room to spread things out.

  Great treadmill for the price I paid for it. Itâs a ton quieter than my old Pro Form treadmill. I like the preset speeds on the right of the control panel where you can hit the presets 1-10 and the treadmill will automatically take you to that speed in miles per hour. I did try out the iFit and personally didnât care for it. I prefer streaming the Peloton app on my TV for their treadmill classes and then control my treadmill manually. Also a plus are the large cup holders where I can put my water, phone, tv remote, etc.

  This is perfect for me. It is sturdy and well made. The belt is plenty wide and long enough. I just walk on it with an incline so I am not sure about running but it fits my need perfectly. You don't have to buy the monthly subscription to get it to work even though it says you do. You just have to hold the iFit button down for like 15 seconds and it activates the treadmill. It is really heavy so it was worth the extra fee to have someone bring it upstairs for me. I highly recommend this.

  The pulse bars do not work. When I called the company the woman who answered the phone stated ""They never work. You can try to get a reading by taking 3 readings and select the third reading as your heart rate"". When I do that my rate is about 120 so that isn't accurate either. When she heard the horrible noise the motor made randomly she ordered a new motor shipped to us. We call a repair person per her instructions when it arrived. His response to the pulse issue was ""Oh they never work on any treadmill - not even the expensive ones"".The motor was quiet when he was here so he didn't replace the motor.We like the Nordic Track other than the pulse meter not working so will just do without it.

I have to walk/run away from the screen to accommodate my stride and then cannot reach the screen controls.  Since I have to walk away from the screeen the handrails are also too short and cannot be used.  Also the controls are very low for a tall person.  You cannot set the time in manual mode to count down or enter youre weight for an accurate calorie count.  Definately disappointed for the price.

  I have had treadmill for 3 months and seems to be working well.  I use it 4-5 times a week running 3 miles and has plenty of room on belt for running.  It takes about an 1 hour to set up and you will need another person to help.  The only draw back was I scheduled a date for delivery and waited around all day for the delivery but it was never delivered.  I had to reschedule another delivery date so it was a waste of a day waiting around.  I would recommend calling the morning of the delivery to make sure its on schedule.

  This treadmill is great. My wife and I have had it for a few weeks, we both use it a few times a week as well as our german shepherd. The treadmill is simple to use and has great speed and incline options. ALSO, my wife and I assembled it ourselves, it took us about two hours from unboxing to fully assembled. Assembly does require two people (for certain steps) and I'd like to note that we are inexperienced with assembling treadmills. We gambled by opting out of the ""expert assembly"" but it ended up being doable.

    Very bad product by nordictrack
  
",1.0,Miguel,"Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2019","









  
  
    
  After reading the reviews, I erroneously chose to ignore the bad reviews. Nordictrack is selling an inferior product and cannot back it up.  The product arrived defective and remained put of order in spite of several attempts by nordictrack to correct the problem. The electrical and mechanical system (the heart of the threadmill) were not in working order. Norditract shipped the parts the first time and they arrived defective. Then, after insisting on a technician to come and fix it,  they shipped the parts again but the technician never showed up even after contacting me once and promising he was going to track the parts and he was going to set up a time once the parts arrived.  I finally called Amazin to return it and they tried to charge me a restocking fee.

  The best purchase I have ever made! I had been shopping for treadmills for over a month. Was looking for something that was gym quality but under $1000. This is an awesome treadmill for the price point. Very heavy duty and doesnât shake when you run. You are able to bypass ifit without purchasing a membership by holding down the button for 30 seconds as others had mentioned. Looking forward to getting back into running everyday!Delivery was also on time and drivers called 40 minutes before they arrived which was convenient. Chose to assemble myself which took about an hour and a half nothing crazy!

  Incline doesn't work out of the box (ticket open/pending), hopefully they can fix it else not sure how to ship this treadmill back. Another negative is that it requires 30 day subscription to ifit before first use, the units display is locked until subscription is activated (credit card info required), also if you dont cancel before 30 days its $15 a month automatically. As for putting it together there were some screws pre-attached on step 8 (page 13) that were almost impossible to take out in order to attach the pulse crowbar.

  On my goodness. It took so long to assemble. The treadmill is great but it took two of us a long time to put it together. Had I known how hard it would be I would have purchased a different company. I have always really liked the brand but l still have the groundwork that we were never able to get screwed in. We are both good at working together and always get things done quickly with very little frustration but not this time. I usually don't give bad reviews but this about did me in

  Knocked it down to 4 Stars only because of the iFit App.  The treadmill works beautifully as expected and I like the Bluetooth capability, but I do feel very ""limited"" to having to use iFit as my workout application.  It is frustrating having to logon to iFit every single time I want to use the treadmill -- I am not allowed to use it in manual mode without selecting 'manual' through the iFit App.  The technicians at iFit are extremely slow (1 week +) to respond to emails and it was impossible to reach them by phone or online chat.

  This is a really great home treadmill. It seems pretty well made and it is super easy to use. Besides myself, my German Shepard love running on it too. Regarding the iFit feature, if you do not want to use it, you can easily turn it off and you do not have to worry about it. If you have a small budget but want a study reliable treadmill, go for this model. I highly recommend it.

  I regret not paying for the expert assembly. But I did it, it was hard and nothing was forgotten or damaged I. The process, but you need way more tools then a simple Phillips head and wrench- you need multipleSized bits ( do not use power tools) and ratchets, there are some frustrating angles and some agility if youâre doing it by yourself.Can seem to get the full iFit access so I donât think that was worth it, and it doesnât have a great app.But 5 Stars for the treadmill part!

  The treadmill arrived on time and was set up.  Then the person setting it up informs me that I can't use it until i sign up for iFIt.  And to sign up for iFit I need to go on my computer and and give them my credit card number.  They tell me that I have one ""free"" month of iFit.  It doesn't matter that I don't want and don't use it.  After the month they started billing my credit card monthly, even though I don't want iFit and am not using it.  They continue billing after I told them stop.  I still have not been able to have them stop billing me.  Pretty shady and deceitful practices.

  It's a solid treadmill.  Fairly well built.  A bit louder than my liking, but you get what you pay for.  One issue I can confirm (I've seen other comments on this as well): The heartrate sensor grips are useless.  The heart rate jumps around all over the place between 70  and 170 BPM.  Doesn't come close to matching my very accurate chest strap monitor.  Why even include this feature if it doesn't work?

Working out with a trainer right on the screen makes running on this a much more pleasant experience that I actually look forward to.

  We installed it and turned it on but it just wouldn't move. It was marking the time and the speed as if we were on it but nothing was happening as of moving. We called Amazon they were very nice and they will have someone come in to box it and return it for us. I am not sure if we will buy again Nordic. Make sure to always buy the insurance.

  This treadmill was 48 hours passed its factory warranty. I contacted Nordictrac and explained the safety issue with the torn belt that flipped during running. This is dangerous and must be defective. They would not honor the warranty plus the warranty starts of the date of purchase not the time you actually receive the treadmill. Then they try to upsell an extended warranty package. I had a Proform treadmill for 20 years before this one.  Never a problem. Still worked when I decided to buy this one. I replaced the track and belt 1x.  Buy Proform. ...not Nordictrac.  See my photos

  it took quite some time for my husband to assemble it, and it worked well, however, every time we use it, there is black dust coming off from the running pad, it scattered around the tread mill, especially at the end, and also on the shoe. I do not know whether the black dust is toxic or not and I am worried that we breath in the black dust. I contacted the amazon technical support and he has no idea about the black dust and he is very nice to offer refund or replacement even though the return window has passed. However, it is impossible for us to put the current back to the original box and I had to give up,  I am planning to give a call to the manufacture.

  The only thing I don't like about this machine is that you have to subscribe to the IFit program to use all it's features.  We press the speed & height and walk....but we can't adjust anything else per person's needs (weight) but we don't really care this time... We will use it till it breaks & get something better next time.

  This is my second Nordic Trac Treadmill. I had my old Nordic Trac for 20+ years of dependable daily service. It was time to step up. I wanted something that provided a video display and the ability to access ifit  trainers. Since I would only buy Nordic Trac, I purchased the 6.5si. It is of the same or better quality as my previous treadmill. My wife and I love our 6.6si. Being able to use it with the ifit trainers is a lot of fun. The quality of the Nordic Trac is second to none and my wife and I are very happy with our purchase and highly recommend it.

It did take 2 hrs to put together but the instructions were clear. The only problem as you can see from my picture is the shipping company cracked the cover. They might want to change shipping companies. Iâm not going to worry about getting it fixed as itâs only cosmetic. Iâm giving it 5 stars because the treadmill does everything I wanted.

  The treadmill worked fine for us, until it completely and suddenly failed.  After waiting for phone Customer Service to pick up over 20 minutes, I hung up and began calling gym equipment repair companies.  We feel ripped off by Icon/Nordic Track.  The fancy features were never important or used.  We wanted to walk and/or run and be able to set and track the speed, time, etc.  I am told when the screen fails, it will cost almost $1,000 and when the electronic board fails, it will cost as much as the machine.  This one is now junk to us and so is the manufacturer.  Not for serious exercisers.

  I bought this to replace a 30 year old treadmill that gave up the ghost. The wider belt is great as I ""wander"" a little as I walk. Very smooth operation. My only complaint is the GIGANTIC console; way to big for an in home unit. It could be 1/3 the size and still get all the controls on it comfortably. Assembly was not a problem as I'm mechanically minded. Just take your time, read twice and do it once. Took me about 2 1/2 hours to assemble.

Make sure you find a level location in your house.My only notes are:When putting this together does require a second person but only for a few steps so keep that in mind or have a stool or chair ready to assist you. The fan doesnât reach you very well when running unless you are fairly close to the console so you donât get much air during sprints.

  I bought this on Cyber Monday, and it was a great value. So far I'm loving this compared to my last treadmill. It runs smoothly and is comfortable for running or jogging. The incline is smooth as well. The only negative I've seen so far is the fold up option is really awkward and sticks out. I don't feel safe with anyone walking around it while it's folded, so I always leave it down. Mine did come with a crack on the plastic along the side of the running belt that I assume occurred during shipping, but Amazon was great about replacing the whole machine. However, I did have to wait about two extra weeks to get the delivery scheduled.

We use it in our garage, no trouble with the breaker tripping as other have commented. The noise level is average for a treadmill.

  First treadmill that I've purchased but it works well. Putting it together took some time but wasn't too bad. It's hard to move around just because it's so heavy. Even with the wheels it's difficult to push to where you want it. We should have thought about where we wanted it beforehand so the delivery guys could have put it there.The machine is easy to use though and works well. Lots of nice features.

  Do not buy this product.  Sadly I been away for work and Iâm no longer able to return this product, the only way to use this product is to download/register to ifit, which is a monthly subscription.Once you download the app, you have to have Bluetooth enable on your device for the treadmill to connect.If it wasnât for having to have a monthly subscription to ifit, I would recommend this product, but having to spend over $700 for this machine then  $15 a month just to use it. Both worth it.

The only issue we had was with the heart monitor which does not seem accurate at all. Since I have a Fitbit, we can let this slide and did not even attempt to fix it.

The treadmill itself is outstanding; however I really enjoy the way it works with the iFit app. That app really sold me on using the treadmill and how seamlessly the speed and inclines are controlled via the training programs on iFit. I also think it makes a lot of sense to purchase the extended warranty - for $149 and a 4 year peace of mind, I don't really see any downside.

  My primary concerned based on other reviews was that the motor would be noisy. That depends entirely on the speed.  If you want it as a walking treadmill, you will definitely hear your footfalls much louder.  You could whisper above the motor, no problem.  If you are a casual runner and want to take it to say 6 miles an hour (that's pretty much a 30 minute 5K) it's quiet.  You can sort of hear it, but not a lot.  If you are a pro athlete and want to take it to 10 miles an hour, first off, respect, and second off, you will hear noise about the equivalent to a car engine on the highway.The iFit attachment, which I recommend, doesn't come with it.  You need to buy it, and the subscription, separately.  It enables you to download a series of training programs via WiFi including what may be the world's easiest C25K program.  They call it Beginner 5K.  It's 4 times a week for 12 weeks. It starts with you casually strolling along on the treadmill for half a mile in 15 minute (think the average walking pace of a senior citizen) but it ends with you running uphill at about 5 miles an hour (at that rate you could finish a 5K in roughly 40 minutes) and there are no sudden transitions.  It just creeps up the incline a little, then the speed, and soon the fast pace of the old level is the resting pace of the new, but it feels like a resting pace.  You build fitness gradually.  The treadmill has some pre-programmed routes and workouts built in, and the site has a great many more.  My only complaint is there is no way to preview the list before subscribing, to know if it's worth it.  Set up for that was a bit of a pain, more so than I'd expected.I found the left speaker a little weaker than the right, but that could be an audio trick used by Zombies, Run!  Otherwise, the sound system is nice.  It plugs in via a standard audio cable, not Blutooth in an era where standard audio cables are going out of fashion.  There are adapters if that becomes an issue.  There are holders for water and phone, etc, and a nice ledge for an ipad.I like the cushioning, and it is adjustable.  I like how easy it is to fold up.  Mind, assemble this where you mean to keep it.  You're not going to fold it and stuff it in a closet.  It's way too heavy for that. Installation takes two people, especially at the end when you have to hold the bottom unit up to install the hydraulic lift.  I needed to check a video for that part.The off switch is to take the little key off the panel.  You can use the reset button on the bottom, if you've set it up to be conveniently accessible, but it takes a lot longer to come back from that.  It actually takes longer to come back from that, than from shutting of the surge protector it's plugged into, which makes me think it is doing some sort of reset processing.  It definitely needs a surge protected, and I recommend the NordicTrack brand for this, just to be safe.Overall, I'd say this is a high quality treadmill at a reasonable price.

  Great for intermediate runners and those wanting to keep active during winter. Would be best for lighter runners as the belt/motor can slip when heavier runners step (over 200lbs).

Heart rate sensors and distance tracking can be spotty, but give a fairly accurate reading under most circumstances. Overall this is a good machine that serves it's purpose with the added feature of mobility and storage space.

  This treadmill has been great since the pandemic started. Iâve logged a little over 500 miles walking while working and running since weâve got it. It is quiet enough when set to walk that my wife doesnât wake up and we live in a studio. The overall support has been good on the knees and shins so far and I would highly recommend.

  We have owned a couple treadmills in the past that were more money.  This Nordic Track is as nice or nicer than the other ones.  Very solid, doesn't move, and  pretty quiet.  Getting it up stairs to our second floor was a bear,  trust me you will need help, but after we got it there assembly was easy.  The only thing that really doesn't work very well are the hand grips that are suppose to show your heart beats, which to me is no big deal.  Overall we are very happy with this machine.

  I must like Nordic Track because this is my forth one in a row since 1994.  If I had known about this scam I would have not bought this one.  I'm eighty years old so I won't have a chance to switch brands.  I feel like taking it to the dump along with the old one. If you experiment you will find you can beat the scammers by holding down the IFIT button until it activates without the scammers. I am amazed Nordic Track allows their customers to be abused like this.

  I just spent a couple hours on the phone with my bank and amazon. Seems as though no one knew anything about the equal pay promotion that both companies attached their name too, and was literally a button on the item I purchased on the Amazon page. Extremely frustrated with Amazon, a complete meltdown in efficiency and competency. I am now without the large amount of money this thing cost; the small amount each month was manageable. Really frustrated with a lack of answers and accountability. Really didn't want to post anything because it felt like a private matter since it involved my financial situation, but the frustration too real.

I got  3 year warranty but hope iI don't need it .This s a great product for under 1000. not sure I will need the gym to open or at least I will keep working out at home when I cant get there. Surprisingly high quality for the money.

  Even though I like how you can unfold it I find the other problems with it our weigh the good in the product. The work out hurts my knees and back and everyone in the house can hear it when I use it. The assembly was very difficult by one person and moving it to another room is so difficult that it has to be assembled in the room you are going to use it in.

I think this practice is illegal product tying, and is pretty despicable.  Sa e yourself some trouble, hold the ifit button for 30 seconds--it unlocks the treadmill without registration.

  We were limited on space in our workout room so went with this smaller treadmill than others. The smaller size doesn't limit the speed or durability of the machine. My wife was worried that she wouldn't be able to run on it but the length is perfect for her and I've been able to do so as well. We have no regrets so far. It fits the space, holds up well, and gives you a good workout. Would buy again.

  The system requires you to go the ifit to activate. Bad move because it requires a credit card.!!!! Once the free period is up the charges start unless you cancel. To get around ifit , turn you machine on and hold the ifit button until the screen changes. Then you are home free. Frustrating that Nordictrack does not include this information in the manual.

  Assembling the product was a bit challenging but the YouTube videos really helped. It would have been helpful if Nordic track could provide all the instruments ( screw driver, spanner etc) for setting up the machine.  The treadmill has all the basic features required. No complaints. A must have for all who are looking for a good tread mill at home.

  This treadmill does everything that it advertises.  It is terrific for me because I have Lupus and cannot go out in the sun, so this is a way to be able to exercise inside.  I have paid for gym memberships many times, but it was getting to the gym that hindered me.  Now that we have this in our home, I can keep a regulated routine.  My husband also loves this, he walks about 4 miles every other day.  We live in SWFL, so the heat can become unbearable.  He is able to walk around his schedule.  Most importantly is the quality of this treadmill.  This treadmill is nicer than most at the gyms that I have been to, and for the membership fees, you can easily have your own in your home.  I highly recommend this!  I would have the expert assembly done, after reading the reviews we decided to have this assembled professionally, and it was completed in a very timely manner.  Thank you, Amazon, NordicTrack, and Icon Health and Fitness!

  We've had this since March, and has been a very good purchase.  The assembly wasn't hard, and working around the iFIT program wasn't that tough to do - it is made to seem more required than it is.  The only thing I would knock is that when mine folds up, it brushes up against one of the arms on the console.  Over time, that might create a little wear, but it's a minor problem.

  I wanted a treadmill at home so that I would exercise more consistently. It arrived quickly after purchase, and the assembly that I purchased through Amazon went smoothly. This treadmill is exactly as advertised in the listing. It has all the features that I need and is the right size for my space. It seems durable and has worked well so far. I look forward to using it for years to come.

",1.0,Brad,"Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  Canât say enough bad things about the assembly process.  I am fairly mechanically inclined, but whether it is bolts not threading properly, impossible angles to tighten bolts, or needing to push the uprights together to get the cross bar to fit.  This is NOT an easy to assemble product.  Would not recommend.  Our box did have a fair amount of damage upon delivery, but everything inside looked fine, maybe something bent that we didnât notice, Iâm not sure.  Either way has been a terrible experience to assemble.

  We get a great workout every day, especially during this COVID-19 confinement era. I love the tilt ability and the ability to make micro adjustments to how fast I want to go. It's solid and sturdy, was easy to assemble and easy to update the software. No issues at all!

  Works great, easy to set up. I have to create my own workouts. The automatic ones don't seem to offer much diversity and I haven't figured out how to adjust them or even if they can be adjusted. The idea seems to be to get you to purchase another electronic trainer device that allows for adjustment and has a variety of choices. The speed control doesn't do much for me. When I push 3, it starts at 4.8 miles per hour. I end up using the manual adjustment which works fine. I'm almost afraid to push the other numbers for fear of what might happen. That said, all the basic functionality works fine. I've got an Alexa, but not an MP3 player, so I let her play music and haven't tried the on board speakers. I start my workout at 4.5 miles per hour and 0 incline. After the first song I go to 5 mph and 2 degree incline. After each succeeding song, I go up two degrees until I reach ten. I stay there through 10 songs at 5 mph, and then come down to 9, 7, 5 and so on. It takes about an hour. It's easy to vary speed and incline to build an interesting workout. My songs vary in length from 2 minutes to 8 minutes, so using them to time my workout gives me some variety. When I was building up, I'd drop back to less incline until I caught my breath, increased speed for a song, and then increased incline again. I'm doing manually what fancy workouts would do. I have issues with balance so I tend to hold onto the handles. I'm very happy with the system. It folds up easily and comes back down easily once you figure out that you have to lift a little, push with your foot and then drop the bed. It's cushioned on shocks so it lifts and lowers pretty much by itself.

Luckily I completed assembly and am using it with the broken panel otherwise it would just be sitting for a month. The biggest complaint is the screen is very dim and not backlit however, I'm not sure if this is because of the damage or just the design. I'll update once fixed.

  Good solid product at a reasonable price.  My only issue was having to sign up for the online classes to get the product started.  I cancelled right away, so it cost me nothing and once you initialize the treadmill, you don't need the online classes to control anything.  You can do it manually yourself.Everything is easy to control.  Supports my 235 lbs.  It is heavy and difficult to get upstairs.

  Product arrived in great shape, not even carton damage.  Delivered fast.Took about 1.5 hours to assemble.  I was able to assemble myself using the enclosed instructions.I use this treadmill daily for 4 mile runs and occasional 10 milers.  Incline is smooth and works great to randomize hills.

  This treadmill arrived exactly on the day it was promised and packaging in good condition. Setup was easy, I did it single-handedly until the last step where I did have some help. I use it every day and couldnât be happier with the model and the iFit program.

  Waste 2 hours to unpack and assemble, then found out a bolt hole on the left arm has bad thread, so all my effort wasted, because Iâm not able to continue. I sincerely hope they could do a better QC job. I canât give a comprehensive review since I simply canât use it.

",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2018","









  
  
    
  When I ordered this treadmill from Amazon, they let me choose the delivery date and time slot.  Everything went as planned.  They called me the day before delivery and then about half an hour before delivery, and they were right on time.  Two men delivered it and they put it in my office exactly where I asked, so delivery was great!  And the package was in pristine condition.My husband put this together in one afternoon.  He only occasionally asked someone to hold this or that, but it's pretty much a one-man job.  You have to know it must have been easy, because he's not one with mechanical aptitude.  Instruction sheets tend to fluster him, but he had no trouble with this machine.This is set to be my husband's treadmill.  He's not interested in the bells and whistles.  He just wants to run.  His only complaint is that the display does not show time and distance together.  It toggles back and forth constantly.I like the treadmill because this sits in my office and it's not as loud as some of the other treadmills we've had here in the past.  Yes, I've walked on it, too (running isn't for me).  I don't care to use the iFIT app or anything like that, so I can't tell you how that goes, but the treadmill runs fine.  The belt doesn't slip and there's plenty of cushioning with each step.

  Cons: The calorie counter is SOOOO wrong. It reads more than double what you actually burn. When you increase the incline, the top of the treadmill doesn't move up so it's hard to hold on if you're used to that. The preinstalled programs suck.Pros: Everything else is great!

  I purchased this product in Mar 18, and register the product the company site. But, I didn't use much until recently, and latelyI used the this product lightly but regularly, 10~15min every morning, for last 1 month.And, I recently noticed regular noise while I was running.  And, I inspected the product, and found the knobs under the cover that screws can be tighten against were all broken but one.  I believed  the  loose cover made noise. However, even without cover, the noise continued. With further inspection, I found the the plastic cover behind the motor was cracked as well.Imagine how uncomfortable it will be to make the cracking sound under you while running. I stopped running because of the noise.Well, I submitted the support request on their designated site, but No Response.  I called their customer service on Friday, 11/16, only receiving the message ""no agent is available for the training for the better service"".  It sounds joking!!Not Durable Product! No Customer Support!Please do not even consider the product.

  I've had my treadmill for 4 months now. I do love it. It came with a pretty damaged box which was the evident cause of a crack in a non-functional piece (only there for looks). That same plastic piece that was cracked is apparently also put on via 2-sided tape and it often pops up on one side.  This doesn't affect the function of the treadmill but it does get on my nerves. Apparently not enough to simply apply another piece though. I opted to leave it alone (the damage)  so I can't speak to customer service. My husband put It together in roughly an hour but he's blessed with a bright mind and alot of common sense. I did have to help hold some heavy parts while he bolted them together. That said,  it's a 2-person job to put it together.  It is louder than I would like.  My husband can't sleep in the next room while I'm on it. I don't have any trouble hearing my show or music which I stream on my tablet.  That leads me to mention the terrible speakers! They are just that... terrible.Honestly,  they are absolutely shameful! I will never make any attempt to use them again.  If that's an important feature to you, keep looking. This is not the treadmill for you!  It serves no function here. Max volume is not even remotely audible to any degree of clarity while the treadmill is running, even at a slow pace.  This is, in my opinion,  the biggest negative on this treadmill.  Back to the positive....I walk and run and the transition between speeds is both easy and smooth.  The incline is fantastic albeit slow. There are lots of programs but I'm a simple girl but a bit of a control freak so I tend to stay in manual mode.  The machine is moveable with its 2 wheels but it's very large,  very heavy,  and quite cumbersome to move in and out of rooms. It is quite easy, however, to lift it and lower it for the space-saving feature. The price was great for the features. And at the end of the day,  I get my cardio in every day in the comfort of my home and it didn't break the bank.  All in all, I'm satisfied with the purchase.  Good luck to you!

  Got this to upgrade from a gold's gym treadmill that was noisy and kept breaking down. I've had it for about 6 weeks and have not a single problem.  I use it everyday as does my wife so it gets lots of use.  She loves the iFit options.  Great treadmill.

  This is actually my 2nd Nordic Track. I waited almost a week to review it because I wanted to be sure it was working correctly.The first one arrived promptly and was assembled correctly however, while the machine worked well and I loved it, the belt kept sliding to one side and it left a fine black dust on everything. My husband readjusted the belt with the tool provided but the next day it went back again. I was afraid the belt was degrading and would eventually break. Also every time I used it I had to sweep and dust the room. Kudos to AMAZON, truly an amazing company. One word to them and promptly, the same day, another machine was on it's way and both times the shipping and assembly costs were refunded within hours not days. All through the process, Amazon kept in touch to assure me that things were going smoothly and I would be satisfied. And I am. I'm not a fitness Guru, I'm just a senior citizen trying to stay in shape.  The extra programs are great but honestly I don't use them. I adjust the speed and incline to my own tolerance not a preset program. Best thing is the cushioning. My old treadmill did not have it. Feels like you are walking on a cloud

  I canât believe I got this for $449.00 on a daily deal. Immediately after the complimentary expert assembly, I got on for a test run. This machine runs smooth and fairly quiet, weâre talking quieter than a vacuum cleaner, probably as loud as an idling newer model automobile. The bells and whistles are all within reach and it appears to be able to withstand my purposes of running to get back into shape. I used to run regularly, now, I plan on jumping on the treadmill to run at regular intervals again. Iâm confident this machine will take the miles. I also want to add the review of this model on TreadmillReviews.net is very misleading and unfairly discouraging for runners shopping for this treadmill. That review site states that this machine is not designed for runners. In my estimation, a 3 time marathon runner and a 3 time half marathon runner, along with countless other charity runs, they are wrong. The top speed is 10 mph. That equals a 6 minute mile. That, in and of itself, is fast enough, to not only compete in an elite marathon event, but it's good enough to win. Come on now, you have the presence of mind to say this machine is not designed for runners. I totally disagree. You will be running once the speed gets up to around 3 mph... I guess the top 7 speeds are for really fast walkers.UPDATE: About one month into ownership I experienced a motor failure. This was apparently due to Amazon selling an older model. I called NordicTrack and was immediately sent a new motor which was fairly easy to install ( note, take a picture of the wired connections before taking the old motor out). Since then this machine has performed flawlessly now for 5-6 months. I am loving the steady runs and my wife and kids hop on to get some exercise as well.

I know a few scratches should not matter, but it does. I would not have purchased this in the store without having received a break on the price. May send this back.

  I bought a used one from Amazon Warehouse. One of the front leg/stubs was broken off and missing. It was screwed in. Those screws were snapped off in the base. I tried to buy a new model with the free installation. The system kept giving me trouble with the code. Scheduling wouldn't work in the app, so I had to get on my computer to do everything. I've been very unhappy with this process. I'm debating buying the T 6.7 for the same price from a competitor. This was for my wife. She was so excited to get this for Mother's Day and was extremely disappointed when I told her it wouldn't work right. I would have already paid the extra 130$ for a new model from Amazon, but the code wouldn't work. I'm fed up and totally don't need this.

  After waiting 6 days to receive my Nordic treadmill, I waited another 5 days to have it assembled only to find out it had been damaged in the factory. Now I have a pile of junk laying in my kitchen floor that resembles a disassembled treadmill. Amazon says they will exchange it but no communication as to when.

  This treadmill worked properly for about 1 week after I received it. Initially, I had issues with the belt staying aligned. It also sporadically stops working in the middle of workouts. I've reached out to Nordictrack 4 times and have received no response. I would not recommend this product.

  I'm giving it three stars because it performs its primary function - you can run up to 10 mph and get an  incline up to 10 ""whatevers"", if you weigh less than 300 lbs. Great. And the price was pretty good. All extra features are garbage.The heart rate monitor is absolutely useless. Speakers are not loud enough to get any sound across when running above 6 mph. There's no built-in cooling period after a run. (This can probably be fixed with a $0.01 software upgrade by the manufacturer.) Calorie counter doesn't take a runner's weight into an account. The dashboard buttons are useless without the iFit subscription. You can still count time, distance, and speed, but that's pretty much it.

  Love the treadmill--it's nicer than i expected and works perfectly. The DELIVERY AND ASSEMBLY HOWEVER WERE A NIGHTMARE. Amazon uses outside parties to assemble--unbeknownst to me. I set up the delivery time and date, with THREE back up times and STILL i was screwed over until some super awesome sweet guy decided to be kind and help me out on his way home. So. Treadmill= GREAT buy, super happy with the purchase. Delivery=on time. Assembly= SUCKED. Until the nice dude came along. Thanks, nice dude, you're the best.

  It's difficult to give this treadmill a 5 star review for one simple reason, iFit. iFit is a horrible program that is confusing and not intuitive in any way. It will fight you at every step. The treadmill is great. Excellent quality, but the control panel is a complete joke. Several times I have touched the wrong button and messed it up so that if you press the 3mph button it goes 4.3 mph?? And press the 4mph button and you get 6.8?? Then after several minutes of trying to reset the unit it will go back to being able to press the 4mph and getting 4mph...but I still don't know why or how...and I was an IT GUY!!!!! I have had two iFit compatible units now and I will not spend another dime on anything associated with iFit.

  We are enjoying this treadmill! The price was excellent and it is perfect for us. We wanted a way to exercise when it is too cold or hot to head outside for our walks.  Even our teens are enjoying it. The book rack is perfect for setting a tablet on to watcha show while exercising. It seems just as nice as the one at my former gym. Glad we bought it!

  This treadmill was such a disappointment.  We thought we were getting a great deal on the Black Friday sale, based on the price and reviews of the treadmill.  After putting it together, which didn't take too long, the first thing we noticed was that the control panel was much lower than our Horizon treadmill we were replacing. The lower height made the view of an iPad or book an uncomfortable distance to read while walking (I'm only 5'4"").  Our major complaint was the inconsistent speed/drag felt while walking at lower than 3 mph.  We called NordicTrack and they sent a lube kit which didn't work.  My husband also tightened the tork adjustment with no luck.So, we packed up the treadmill thinking we got a lemon and asked for a replacement.  I do love Amazon's return policy.  The new treadmill was delivered today with a crack on the front panel.  We will return and NOT try another one.

  I was happy to see that Amazon now offers Nordic Track products since my experience with them through the years has been great! We are extremely happy with our T 6.6 S Treadmill and found it the perfect product to help us improve our cardiac and general health. The system was delivered extremely quickly, needed two of us to easily set it up, but was assembled quickly, and it worked immediately. We found that we needed to place a surge protector in our electrical line from the wall to the Nordic Track to protect from surges and ARCs that might trip the breaker, so we acquired an Isobar Premium Surge Suppressor and arc /noise filter available from Amazon to supply the added protection and as suggested in the manual. Great and inexpensive product from Amazon. We continue to love Nordic Track and Amazon!

    Definitely a 5 star treadmill...BUT...
  
",5.0,Biggles,"Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2016","









  
  
    
  I almost downgraded this machine for one reason...We have to use a package forwarding service because we live out-of-country. So, it's a bit of a crapshoot to buy things since a product might have a defect, shipping problems, etc. Unfortunately, one other reason is when a manufacturer doesn't do a basic package check before a box is sealed and shipped, as was the case for us.First the good...--The machine is awesome! I did a pretty major search for treadmills w/an incline and a few extra features that wouldn't break the bank. This definitely filled the bill.--It was great to use my MP3 player and have music loud enough to hear, but soft enough not to bring out the wrath of the neighbors. For me, any distraction while walking, such as TV or music, helps. While we haven't yet signed up for Ifit, that's next. I have no doubt it will be another bennie.--I was surprised at how basic the assembly was. I'm totally useless at figuring out putting things together, but even someone as non-mechanical as I am could do it. Everything was labeled, listed in order, and placed on a sealed piece of cardboard that it made it nearly idiot-proof (I say that because there's always that one person...).--The packing was very well done. A great deal of care and shipping materials were used to protect everything.Now, the not-so-good:Inside the box, there was a yellow sheet for lubrication instructions. It told us what to use (included applicator and lube) and how to do it. Well, the sheet was the only thing included. While someone may say that we probably threw them out, nope. Hubby broke down the entire package before we began (all parts separated so that we knew what they were, putting the waste aside, etc, etc). Then, I went back over all of the packing material a second time before we boxed it all up for the garbage. Yes, we really did that since it's too easy to misplace a part if you're not careful. While this is EXTREMELY annoying, I finally decided I didn't want to downgrade a 5 star machine over some packing wonk's one star check-off performance.

  Don't buy! They will ship you a defective model that will not work. Electric wiring is not working. When you call them, they will conveniently ship you the wire to re-attach with a step by step detailed video (shocking)... so it's a problem they consistently have. Replacing wire is not easy... it's a very long process. They were very quick to tell us on the phone that we may have ""pinched"" the wire. That's why it's not working. We just got done replacing the electrical wiring that required us to in-install the whole thing and it's still not working. It's a piece of crap. I will be returning this and gettin something else. Don't waste your money.

  We're loving this treadmill.  Putting it together took a while, but wasn't hard--just time consuming.  Treadmill runs great and is exactly what we needed.  The max speed is 10 MPH, which is fine for us, as we are not fast runners. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles that other models might have, but the price is great and the quality is exactly what we were looking for.  I recommend this model.

Still in process of building it but we were disappointed when we removed the track part and found this crack. Hopefully that's our only problem.

I love the ease of putting it away when not in use and then a simple push on the foot symbol to bring it back down again.  Great for the ladies!  It is a beast to put together, other reviews said 2 hours and I would agree with that.  Solid steel construction.

The directions are great and well laid out. I like using it and everything works great. The only thing is the belt pulls to the left even though I have adjusted it 2 times. Other wise I would give it 5 stars. Over all I am very pleased with my treadmill and so glad I can exercise now and don't have to go outside when it is 16 degrees or less outT. Sullivan

    Basic Treadmill, Don't Expect Much More
  
",4.0,Patrick A.,"Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2016","









  
  
    
  WARNING: Other reviews have stated that the delivery people will take the treadmill downstairs. This is not my experience. The company that delivered my treadmill only sent one person to do the job. He couldn't even get the package up the front steps because it was so heavy, and he refused to help get it down the stairs. If you are going to buy a heavy item from Amazon, don't assume that the delivery people will deliver it anywhere besides the front door.Pros:-Easy to assemble. It took two people about 1.5 to 2 hours.-Hydraulic arm enables the bottom section of the treadmill to lift up, saving space if necessary.Cons:-The belt moves inconsistently at speeds below 2.5mph. It feels jittery, like it's having trouble moving.-The build in speakers deliver low quality audio, and the max volume is not that great. It's difficult to hear podcasts or videos over the sound of the treadmill. Music listeners shouldn't have any issues with volume.-The build-in software have an additional monthly charge.-Heartrate monitor is inaccurate.

  I am not able to give a five star review as yet. It was just delivered yesterday.. However, I will say that it seems fairly quiet and operates smoothly. It was delivered a day before it was scheduled to be delivered. All very nice. However, it was not as easy to put together as I had read in some reviews, one claiming to have ut it together by himself in an hour! NO WAY!. It definitely takes two people. I had a friend helping me who is one of those who can fix or build anything and it took us about 2 hours to put the treadmill together. It is a BIG treadmill. It is solidly built. I didn't like the fact that it did not come with the means to lubricate it. I just purchased lubricating packets. Not sure if I am supposed to wait until I use the lubricant or go ahead and use it and worry about lubrication later. No biggee I guess. The incline works well and all and all it seems to be a good quality treadmill. Will know more after a couple of weeks of use.

  Sadly I cannot recommend this treadmill due to the fact it arrived damaged & when we called Nordic track (we purchased the extended warranty) rather than expedite a simple replacement part they said âback order, no idea when it will be available, call Amazon to RETURN â What???? I put it together already, Iâm using a damaged treadmill that I paid $600 plus for. Not good.

  Absolutely great for the price. My only issue, if any, is with the sound system. It is really poor quality. I can get better quality from my android phone.The customer service at Nordic Track is sad. I had our unit professionally installed. But two weeks in, it started squeaking really badly. No troubleshooting guide on Nordictrack site - I could not even find the model number. Then, 60 minutes into a web chat with the service folks, it was obvious that they were hopelessly clueless. Eventually, some youtube-ing later, we decided to find all metal on metal contacts and WD40 them one by one. We found the problem contact. And now it is a dream to run on. Hip hip hurray, husband - thank you. And absolutely NO thanks to the Nordictrack service agents. Hopefully they will hold up their end of the warranty contract when something really goes wrong. Fingers crossed!

  I am 66 years old and overweight - like 40 lbs worth. I've been a little weary of starting up exercising again but I have to say this treadmill is a dream. I've had a couple of others in the last few decades and this is the best one yet.I walked 2 miles this morning and feel great. This machine is smooth as silk -no swollen knees, no backache- just feeling good. I started with just one mile a day and will go up to at least 3 miles a day. I love the incline variety and even the cup holders are better.

    extra information about treadmill
  
",4.0,katydid,"Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2017","









  
  
    
  buyers check your breaker panel if you are setting this up in a bedroom. i really wish amazon or Nordic Trac would have given this information in the description. i have had my treadmill for 10 days and have yet to use it because of waiting for electrician to tell me it wont run on a GFI breaker and i will need an ARC filter. In order to get Nordic trac to talk to you be aware that you must have your treadmill registered!!  use the smart phone sticker on the display. i tried to do it on my computer and could not get it done. but the smart phone way was easy. Fyi, the housing code where i live requires the gfi breakers on bedrooms as a safety device. according to the licensed electrician i paid $75 bucks to, if i move the treadmill to the living room it would probably work. :(

    Great product and easy assembly
  
",5.0,J. Pastor,"Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2016","









  
  
    
  So far so good and can't beat the price! Best suggestion is to assemble yourself. Nordic Track knows what they're doing and doesn't deliver a treadmill in 50 pieces. It helps to have someone assisting to hold things together but for the most part I did it myself and do not consider myself very handy. The instructions provided are matched with illustrations and step by step pairing with the screws needed. We originally added the service provider to assemble and it was going to cost over $100 (initially it was $75 but they emailed after saying with the complexity that they needed to charge more). Even after that they weren't very accommodating to availability and then tried to change the appointment the day before. I requested to keep the time scheduled since I adjusted my schedule to be home and their suggestion was to contact Amazon and get a different service. Glad I canceled since it really was very easy.As far as the actual treadmill goes.... it has a ton of functionality and options for settings and types of workout. It's very easy to use and I would say it is better than most you see in gyms. Haven't had the chance to REALLY break it in but will update if there are any warnings that need to go out. This is just for our makeshift gym in our basement and will be a great addition. Good luck and enjoy!

  The treadmill is awesome. I'd give it 5 stars but the assembly was a nightmare. The instructions were fine but there were 4 screws that were in the uprights that had to come out before you could screw the arms on. It seemed to me that they were put in to tread the holes but they were only started and not driven in at all as if someone forgot to do it. Getting them out was easy but putting the arms on and threading in the new screws was near impossible.Could have just been a fluke. Everything else is fine and the treadmill is used everyday and works great.

  Overall a good product. The controls are straight forward (although a bit on the basic side) and it feels very steady.  It is VERY heavy so had to pay a little extra to have delivery guys take it upstairs where I needed it. A little pricey for the features and a little louder than I expected but I like it. Only downside I really don't like is that it occasionally pops the fuse breaker at my house. That may be a problem with my house but this seems to be the only thing that does that.

    Do not buy it for the features.
  
",3.0,Renee,"Reviewed in the United States October 27, 2016","









  
  
    
  I ordered this treadmill back in March of 2016 and have been using it regularly so far. The main reason I chose to purchase this model is because it has a higher weight limit, allowing all of the members of my household to use it instead of just me. That is honestly the only reason I would purchase this model. Here are the reasons I am not really impressed: -I have found the heart rate monitor has no idea what my heart rate actually is. Usually my heart rate is high (resting is in the 80s, but when I run it is in the 180s), this monitor says that after running a few miles my heart rate is in the 60 to 80 range.-The speaker also seems to get louder at random times for just a moment or two before going back to normal. The speaker only goes up to 16, which with some devices I find to be extremely quiet. Sometimes I just leave my tablet unhooked to it because the tablet speaker gets louder anyway.-About two months ago the treadmill began to squeak and I can't figure out why. The belt does not need lubricant and it squeaks on and off. If it is changing the incline the noise stops, after a minute or two it comes back. It usually squeaks every step, but sometimes it randomly stops and I think it fixed its self. Then it will start back up for no reason. I am honestly baffled as to what is causing this noise and have no idea how to fix it.All in all, I would only buy this if you require a higher weight limit (this machine is limited to 300 pounds where most cheaper units are 250 pounds). The other features on it seem to be vastly lacking.

    Very sturdy, very heavy treadmill but well built.
  
",5.0,Junior M.,"Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2016","









  
  
    
  It's a great treadmill for the price. The construction is very sturdy and the electronics are sufficient for customizing your own workout. It was well packed in the box and it's VERY HEAVY. The delivery guys said it felt like it weighs a lot more than 200 pounds. I can see why it had to be delivered by common carrier. It took me about 2 hours to put it together and that was a workout in itself. The instructions were very clear and the hardware was shrink wrapped and numbered according to the steps in the assembly manual. The hardware includes the key but you will need a phillips screwdriver and some wire cutters to clip the zip ties from some of the packing material, and there will be a lot of packing material. The unit doesn't look that big in the video but it's really HUGE, so it's not really suitable if you have a small apartment. There are some design issues that can be improved. The display and stands could be improved to allow it to collapse or removed for easier storage. The unit only has 2 wheels and if you're moving it in one direction then only one person is required, but to move it in the opposite direction you'll need help. It you look at the end of the video, it shows the model lifting the base with no effort. What is not shown is that the reason it's so easy is due to the gas charged strut like you see on the hoods and trunks of cars. Moving the base to the ground is very easy and the strut will ease it to the ground with no hands.The base is extremely heavy without the strut. I estimate that about 95% of the total weight is in the base which is at least 200 pounds. The weight alone gives the impression that it is a really solid piece of equipment on par with commercial models. The instructions don't go anywhere near a workout routine. You will have to do your own research based on your own fitness level and goals. It is compatible with iFit but that's an expensive endeavor. Once assembly is done then you are on your own in regards to a suitable workout routine. As far as the electronics, there are no input parameters for gender, height, weight, age, and fitness level, so I don't know how the calorie burner could possibly be anywhere near accurate. Considering that other more expensive NordicTrack models this one is very good for the price.

I now have a TV with my treadmill soo I donât use the speakers, and never got the iFit to work like I was hoping, but for a just a good treadmill with incline I love it!Review from 2016:  Overall I enjoy this treadmill so far. The right side plastic cover at the bottom of the treadmill was broken when it arrived at my house, but the treadmill works great besides this cosmetic fracture. It has instructions regarding how to lubricate the belt, but it doesn't come with the applicator and lubricant to perform this. It also doesn't have the best instructions, and I have yet been able to figure out how to connect my IPad - IFit program to work with the treadmill. I know it is possible, and I plan to search YouTube for clear directions.The only true complaint I have about this treadmill is that the speakers are very quiet. When I am walking I am able to hear the music, but when I am running and have the music turned up all the way, I can barely hear it. I prefer louder music and better speakers, as the belt is about equivalently loud to the speakers when running. I have enjoyed several runs on it so far, and am pleased. I hope that this treadmill lasts me a couple years.

  LCD screen has broken twice, loses the pixelation and becomes unreadable.  Frustrating as the mechanics of the machine were good.  Used at least once per day for 2 hours.  Nordictrack says I have it in the wrong place, my garage.

  This is a negative review.I wish I hadn't bought it sight unseen. It is poorly designed in the following ways.  I am a 5'8 woman with fairly long arms. However the short stubby hand bars on the side are too short for comfort.  My hands have to be resting on the outer edge of the bars and even then the tips of my sneakers hit the edge on the protective cover over the belt.  Thus every time my sneaker hits the cover there is a clatter. If you are running you have to step back in order not to hit the protective cover.  When you step back you are out of range for grasping the side bars.  This is a potentially dangerous situation. In addition the hand bars are not designed for easy grasping, they are short, thick, tapered, and smooth.Another design flaw is that when holding the cross bar where  you place your hands to have information transmitted  regarding heart rate etc. it requires that you stand fairly close to the front of the machine, thus more clatter when your sneaker hits the protective cover.  My husband has the same difficulty with both situations I have described.I am appalled that a company with a reputation for quality and design slipped up this way. Given the cost of the machine it is even more reprehensible. Unfortunately Nordic Track is not shown in most sports stores store anymore, according to the company representative I talked with.What I like about the machine is it is sturdy, the belt is wide and it is quiet.

  Overall good quality looks nice.  Compact when folded up.  Fits in my office were some other units would've been much too large.  Technology plugin/features are dated.  Motor seems a little underpowered, belt will slow and speed up ever so slightly with each step.  This makes a slightly annoying sound.

  This is a beautiful, solid piece of machinery. It is relatively quiet for a treadmill (not silent, but not loud either.)  This Nordic Track T 6.5 may not be the latest model, but it is close. I have been comparing treadmills for months now in search of the right one, and this is by far the nicest machine I have seen for the price. It's worth every penny. The 25 year warranty on the motor and lifetime warranty on the frame is incredible. I like this every bit as much as I like the commercial at my local gym. I have only had mine up and running for a week, but it already feels like part of me. The controls are intuitive and flexible.The incline is so easy to operate, and the speed controls change effortlessly.  So far, so good!

  The treadmill is functioning as expected.  I've only had it a couple weeks and everything works as advertised, but the delivery service left me angry.  Since they give a 12 hour window, 9am to 9pm, I had my elderly mother stay at the house to sign for the delivery.  She opened the door and said to put the box just inside the door, as the shipping rules stated they were only responsible to bring the box inside the threshold of the house.  They flat our refused to bring the package into the house then lied and said they were not allowed to enter.  When she asked again to bring it in they were rude to her and, as she put it, ""yelled at her"" for asking.  Keep in mind this package is very large and nearly 200 lbs.  I wish I had been there to defend her from this lazy, bullying behavior but I have a feeling they would not have acted like that for me nor would I put up with it.  Its sad to see employees taking advantage of elderly people because they know they are more timid and less likely to argue.

  So far I have been pretty impressed with this product.  I spent a lot of time going between this one and a newer, spiffier model, and decided to forego some of the bells and whistles to save myself some money, hoping I was not also sacrificing quality.  When the product arrived, Amazon delivered within 20 minutes of their top-end estimate, which was REALLY nice.  This is heavy (somewhere around 200lbs), especially on the end with the motor, so I would definitely recommend two people to carry it and to assemble it. My husband and I were able to unbox, move the pieces from our garage and into the house, and assemble within an hour.  Everything worked great when we turned it on without any hiccups.  This is not exciting in its digital display or it's programming options, but it's not total bare-bones, either.  I am usually watching something on my ipad while running so I don't care much about the lack of a screen to capture my attention, but the speakers on this unit are definitely lacking in output.  I end up just using my bluetooth speaker and set it next to the machine instead of using the jack.  I am a recreational runner, usually running 3 miles or doing moderate sprint work/intervals.  For myself, this machine most definitely meets my needs and I am very happy with it.  I haven't purchased the optional IFIT or whatever it is to use with it and just boop the buttons manually and don't do much with the included program options.  It's a comfortable run and that makes me happy.

I was lucky, my box delivered without any damage. I read some information before I bought it.1) If your weight 150lbs, buy treadmill with bigger capacity, 50-60 lbs more than your weight.2) Than more you weight and you will run on this treadmill, than more HP you need.3) Look careful for capacity,how many pounds treadmill can handle.

Controls are geared toward subscription to IFIT.com $99 a year, this is a little disappointing. Feels strong and stable, speakers are low sound.

    Extremely Happy With Our Nordic Track Treadmill!

  My husband and I bought the Nordic Track Treadmill on a lightning deal that was 200 dollars less than Amazon's price, so we got a fantastic deal. The machine, itself, is awesome. We are starting slow, but this has many features that will be well-used as we improve and re-do our goals. We trusted the name of Nordic Track and did some research on this particular machine; it is highly rated and just a great machine! We highly recommend this for beginners, as well as runners. We are just walking slowly now, as we haven't exercised in a long time. We also like the fact that we don't have to depend on weather conditions to walk either. It is our ideal treadmill machine!

  Bought as an early mother's day present for myself.  It arrived today.  My husband and I assembled it in less than 2 hours.  The entire family has already tried it out and it was a perfect fit for our family.  Runs quietly for the size of the machine.  A fan placed next to it supplied the only feature it was missing!  And I love the bar that makes raising and lowering it so much easier because it is one heavy machine.  I hope we have many years to come to enjoy this product.

  I was in pulmonary therapy for a while  and once it stopped I noticed a difference in my breathing and lung function. So I decided to purchase a treadmill. I didn't want the best machine out there and I sure didn't want a cheap one. I came across this one being middle of the price range and being a brand name I have hear of, I decided to buy it. It was delivered buy a guy in a truck and in my case I had to help unload it and bring it in the house. Remember I have lung problems and I'm trying to help carry a 200 pound machine up a bunch of stares to get to my door. So have someone available to help you out. The idea was to put the treadmill in an upstairs second bedroom.....yeah not happing. Now I have a treadmill in my living room. Thinking this really is not a bad idea because I have no excuses for not using it. My lung function has increased, I can now walk faster than 1.5 mph and I have lost 30 pounds. Not bad for buying this back in august of this year. Like others have said it did not come with lube but, there is a sheet that says it don't need it. I highly recommend this treadmill.

    RATING ON DELIVERY AND PURCHASED ASSEMBLY ONLY (Assembly notes included)
  
",1.0,Diane C,"Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2016","









  
  
    
  First, on DELIVERY.  They showed up when scheduled and called ahead.  All good.  Unfortunately, they do not bring the box inside of the house.  I had my mother (80 years old) wait for delivery.  I assumed they would at least carry it inside of the door.  Nope.  They are only required to leave it at the door, outside of the house.  Thankfully, an incentive can still be used to get help (read not a free delivery).Second, on PURCHASED ASSEMBLY.  My appointment was Thursday morning between 8 and 11.  I wake up to an email from the company that they have rescheduled for between 2 and 5.  Well, how convenient for them!  Fortunately, I was able to move my personal schedule around to accommodate the new time.  As it turns out, that was unnecessary.  They never showed or called.  I spoke with Amazon Customer Service who said they would work on getting someone in.  No emails, no calls.  I go online and see that my rescheduled appointment was made without consulting me for a week later than initially scheduled.  That didn't work for me.So, I ASSEMBLED MYSELF.  Let's do introductions...  I am a moderately fit single woman.  I grew up trailing my father around the house fixing things, and have a tool bench.VERY TOUGH ALONE I managed to assemble this myself, but would highly recommend having a second set of hands.  I was able to use pieces of wood to lever things in upright fashion, but it would be safer to have someone hold things in place.PIECES AND INSTRUCTIONS ARE GOOD AND EASY TO FOLLOW.  A couple of pertinent notes.When installing the HANDRAIL (step 6 in my version), there are 2 bolts in them.  These get in the way.  They tell you to remove them later (step 8 in my version).  They should tell you in step 6.The CROSSRAIL was attached to the console in my shipment.  It is a little confusing when looking at the instructions and not finding a separate piece.  You can just pluck it out of the console.The LATCH CROSSBAR can be put on upside down (guess how I figured this out! ;).  There is a sticker to show which side goes toward the belt, but you need to make sure that the holes are toward the ground to attach it to the STORAGE LATCH.Hope this helps!  The machine itself is relatively easy to assemble and based on a quick start and test looks great.  I will add more on performance later, but thought this was critical to know when ordering.  It took me 2.5-3 hours while multitasking (coffee and conference calls).

    Great Machine, Don't Pay for Assembly
  
",4.0,Lipstikstain,"Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2016","









  
  
    
  The treadmill is an excellent piece of equipment!!  However, if you're considering paying for the service provided by Amazon to assemble the treadmill, DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.  First, Sonny's Handyman Service was scheduled to arrive between a certain time and NEVER showed up.  After realizing Sonny's Handyman service would not be following through on their commitment, I decided to diagnose the challenge assembling the treadmill myself.  I am NOT mechanically inclined, yet I was able to assemble the treadmill within 1 hour.  Again, GREAT piece of equipment.  And AGAIN, don't waste your money paying for assembly, especially if its through Sonny's Handyman Service.

    Nice Treadmill with Lots of Great Features
  
",5.0,DJ,"Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2016","









  
  
    
  First of all, the box is HEAVY (almost 200 lb.), so make sure the carrier places it where you can assemble it.  Once assembled, it is easy to move.  Assembly took me approximately 2 hours (I was in no rush).  Read the instruction manual before beginning and you will have no problems.  Follow the suggestions regarding how to remove the packaging.  I did not attempt to move the treadmill until it was completely assembled.  It will take 2 people to complete the final step or two.Once assembled, the treadmill is easy to use, quiet and has many different built in programs for you to use.  Controls are easy to use and clearly marked.  The belt and motor are quiet and the heart rate monitor is accurate.  The built-n programs are easily adjusted to suit your needs.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with this treadmill

    Criminal Company

  This company is as slimy as they come as referenced by hundreds of reviews on this Facebook page alone. We bought a NordicTrack Treadmill 4 years ago, we like it when it works but has broken several times and is under warranty. On our latest issue we called NoridcTrack as we have before and the representative asked if we could video chat so he could examine the problem more closely. We complied, he instructed me to start taking certain part of the treadmill apart so he could look at  the components, I foolishly complied  even though I had  no obligation to take my tools to a product under warranty.After about a half hour the representative realized out treadmill was in the garage. Yes-itâs in the back room of a temperature controlled garage in as area set up as a gym. He immediately canceled our warranty based on âUnsuitable environmental conditions.â What an invasion of privacy after we agreeâd to a video chat. He refused to let me talk to a supervisor or send someone out to reassemble the now dismantled machine that now doesnât work at all based on his instructions. He then discontinued the phone call. This company is for profit only, be warned.

  We just received our treadmill Saturday morning and so far, so good. It took about 2 hours for my husband and I to get it in the house and then to assemble it. The instructions were clear and easy to follow.I played around with the treadmill that afternoon to take it for a test run. The horse power is pretty impressive for such a cheap model. It's fairly quite and the display is easy to read and navigate. I don't know that I'll get to serious into the different training modes, but it does have tons of options. I ran on it at 5.5 mph for a mile and a half at different inclines and it was totally on par with the treadmills I use at the gym.We haven't tried the speakers yet because we need an auxiliary cord to plug in our phones.  The two compartments on either side of the display are great for holding your phone, bottle of water and a towel. While I haven't tried to move the treadmill into the upright folded position, it looked simple enough when my husband did it, but the track portion is fairly heavy.I'll update my review again if we have any problems.

  Just a total mess trying to get this delivered.  First one was broken in transit and Amazon Customer Service made it right.After setting it up, the track stuck periodically.  It needed lubricant and enclosed in the box instructed the customer to call directly to NordiTrac if this problem occurs.  Called the number and met THE worst customer service representative.  He refused to listen (kept talking over us), refused to send the lubricant (because he insisted the item was pre-lubed) and even refused to connect us with his manager-yes, it was that bad.My wife is he most kind, sweet and understanding Georgia Southern woman.

    Nordick Track trades product quality/customer satisfaction for short-term profit
  
",1.0,Paul Hostettler,"Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2019","









  
  
    
  Earnestly, I'd give about a 2 and a half star rating, but who reads 2-3 star reviews when trying to figure out what's objectively wrong?Issues:1. So Nordick Track is a household name-brand, and they've decided to capitalize on that getting rid of the sturdy metal frames that established their brand and convert to cheap, flimsy made-in-China plastics. I assembled it out of the box and found the plastic frame pieces all warped and ill-fitting with random corners and edges popping out. Customer Support did get around to sending out a technician (due to other issues) who professionally assembled it with newly mailed replacement plastic frame pieces... and there's still unjoined corners that stick out and look like garbage. Congratulations on saving a few dollars on materials while sacrificing product quality NT.2. My heart rate monitor will not work, and Nordick Track says it's a feature, not a bug. Giving me readings of 44 (bradycardia), then 10 seconds later 163 (tachycardia), then back down to the 60's, then who knows where. Either my treadmill is malfunctioning or I need a pacemaker. If NT had advertise it as a random number generator, I wouldn't have a complaint, but they very clearly brag how their smart system utilizes your heart rate and other metrics to science, but garbage in, garbage out. I contacted them multiple times, they tried replacing the heart rate bar, that didn't work, they did the math on shipping a new console, decided that was too expensive, tried to buy me off with a chest strap heart monitor (wat?), then ultimately decided to piss on me and tell me it's raining. ""You can't expect medical grade accuracy,"" that was their line. So my heartrate is somewhere between 44 and 163, well thanks, that covers just about the range of survivable human heart rates, thanks NT. It's bull**** and insulting. Nordic Track did their best to convince me they're incapable of designing a functioning treadmill instead of paying to ship a replacement console, but I'm not as stupid as they clearly think I am.3. You'll notice the absence of a convenient tray for a book or a tablet present in earlier models, they even designed their heart rate bar to be rounded to ensure anything you try and rest  on it ends up falling to the ground (so, smart phones, tablets, enjoy shattered screens.) Now why would they possibly do that? Previous versions had it? Could it be that they're moving to a subscription model for their iFit content? Maybe they want to make it difficult for you to provide your own jogging distraction material so they can sell you theirs at $468 a year. Sure they give you a year free, what better way to get you hooked on their product. It's a cynical cash-grab, taking away functionality to breed dependence.Somewhere, corporate efficiency experts are advising companies to cut corners, convert to plastics, out-source labor, engage in shady micro-transactions, and otherwise squeeze every last dollar out of their cow-like consumer base. If we as consumers want to be treated any better, we have to hold them accountable, change the mathematics and demonstrate that their are consequences for underestimating your customers. Otherwise, shoddy, valueless products will be the future. Millenials are a lot of things, and willing to see through corporate exploitation, finding offense with crooked business practices, adjusting their spending preferences accordingly, and communicating their dissatisfaction to other potential consumers within their peer group numbers among them.*sigh*As for objective strengths, it hasn't broken yet (I've had it for a few months now, so that isn't saying much), it feels good to run on, the fan is strong, my children love the music selection, iFit programming is legitimately engaging and productive for quality workouts.A feature I would like to see would be a boom arm in the console that can raise, lower, tilt the embedded tablet. Only having one small screen at a fixed distance and angle is very limiting (although, an excellent impetus to have people pay $1,000 more dollars for the larger embedded tablet that probably costs $20 more in fabrication costs, sorry, I can't stop myself)At the end of the day, it comes down to what $1,400 means to you. If it's nothing to you, chump change, and you just want a cheap, enjoyable play treadmill you have very few expectations of? Go for it. If $1,400 means a lot to you, and you think such a sum qualifies as an investment for your future, be prepared to be very disappointed.

  We owned a Nordic track earlier which we used for 6 yrs and so my expectations from this treadmill were higher. Firstly the assembly and taking it to basement was an issue. Amazon by default did not put in the basement and neither did the assembly guys. took couple of phone calls to sort it out.Next on the product - the treadmill in itself is nice except for two main issues. The front potion has a huge slab of nordic track which gets in the way of walking, I happen to hit on it when I am walking holding the sides. Secondly there is no fan. I wish I knew that before I bought the product.

  I ordered the white glove delivery service, which included assembly of the treadmill.  After they left, I reviewed the user's manual and found MULTIPLE assembly errors.  Some that may be potential safety hazards.  I discovered multiple screws missing, star washers not installed, screws over torqued, and the plastic housing overlapped and not properly seated.  MOST IMPORTANTLY, the power cord was not fully placed inside the right support arm and the wire was pinched between the frame and the bottom metal base.  It does not appear that the ground wire was properly attached.  My wife and I have unplugged the unit due to a concern for potential fire hazard or electrical issue(s).I was going to dissemble the unit myself and assemble correctly, however I discovered that the ""Patch screws"" used to attach the crossbar to the left and right uprights had been completely stripped.  The manual states in several places not to use power tools for assembly.  A power drill was used throughout the assembly process by the delivery personnel.  The ""Patch screws""  will need to be cut for removal.  Not certain what else is missing or improperly instaled, as I could not disassemble the unit.Before unplugging, attempted to use the treadmill, but found it to be VERY unstable.  Not certain if that is due to the inept installation or the unit itself.  The other unit we had started smoothly.  This treadmill JERKS abruptly when it starts and stops.  Concerned about wrenching my back and/or knees.  Also discovered that you CAN NOT access the (50) preinstalled programs.  A complaint has been sent to customer service and waiting for a response.  We are requesting a replacement.  DO NOT use the NordicTrack website or their ""white glove"" delivery service at $259.00.  Amazon is much cheaper.  Amazon lists a (4) hour assembly time for their service.  The delivery people from Ryder were in and out in 30 minutes.

  I ordered a NordicTrack treadmill as a family Christmas present on 11/19... still waiting for it two days after Christmas. On hold with customer service AGAIN trying to track it down.  The good news is, if they finally set up a delivery date for me I will then be transferred to another department who will hopefully be able to tell me why an unauthorized charge for Nordic Track of $56 hit my account a week or so ago.  I assume it is for the iFit subscription that is supposed to be free for the first year.  Tried sorting that out before (you have to deal with a separate department from shipping), but after an hour on hold I gave up.My latest call with the NordicTrack shipping department as I type this is currently one hour and twelve minutes long.  They are going to send an EMAIL to the shipping company that has the treadmill, and can expect a response back within TWO DAYS. And the rep I'm speaking with doesn't have the ability to call me back, so if I don't hear anything back I can expect to spend another hour or so on hold to go through this all over again (this is one of MANY calls I've made). By the time I get this treadmill it will probably be warm enough to run outside again.If unauthorized charges, shipping hell, and absolutely horrible customer service are your thing, this product is for you.  Otherwise, check out the many other options available from better providers.

  I like the treadmill but I don't like that they constantly try to force you to sign up for iFit. Basically, if you're not going to utilize the iFit membership, don't buy this treadmill. After almost 2 years of happy (and free) use, they just released a software update (September 2020) that elimnates any/all free basic content. This includes basic workouts that have pre-programmed distances, elevation, and speed changes. I could have purchased a WAY cheaper analog treadmill that has all these functions! To be fair, they still have some free content with their trainers chirping at you the whole time, but I don't need that. I'm just asking for a pre-programmed workout with elevation and speed changes.I'm torn between burying my rage deep deep down and just continuing to work out on this thing OR dragging it to the curb and putting a ""FREE"" sign on it just out of spite.PS - iFit and NordicTrack could care less. Unless you sign up for their $15/month membership, they already have your money from the purchase of the treadmill and you can pound sand. Welcome to customer service in 2020. :)

  For this price I think it was great! I researched for about two months, looking for a treadmill that was within my price range and had everything i wanted: automatic incline, good for long legs, touch screen, not too loud, foldable.  Iâm 7 1/2 months pregnant and put it together myself. Iâm 5â9 and the length of the track is great. I waited a few weeks to write this review after setup/use to make sure it was honest. The package upon initial arrival was heavy. Luckily the delivery guy brought it inside my house (small front stairs) without paying that extra $40 fee that they charge to bring it inside and not leave it on the front step (you can usually just give the delivery people a cash tip and theyâll do it without the fee). The package itself was a bit torn or holes in some places. I didnât take off any stars for that because thatâs a delivery problem not Nordicâs. My treadmill wasnât broken or cracked like other reviews. It took me like three hours to put together. I used a tall chair for the parts that it said to use another person to hold certain parts while you screw in. Took off one star during this because one bolt in the front wouldnât screw in. The pre made whole was too big. They also didnât include the tool needed to tighten the front bolts. I have a standard tool box that didnât come with the wrench size needed and I had to order it off amazon. I followed the given manufacturer manual to assemble and also followed along with a YouTube video from a professional that gave me tips and tricks, highly recommended.The iFit was included free for a year which I actually enjoy. I set it up before I turned on the treadmill. I love the programs and the ability to run with a trainer. This system is constantly updating itself and bug fixes which is nice. It records all your runs and progress too. Iâm not a marathon runner by any means, I just enjoy the daily 30 minute run so it works for me. The treadmill isnât very loud. My infant daughter canât hear it down the hall when i run in the mornings. The manual does suggest a surge protector so I would definitely pick one of those up before the treadmill comes. The treadmill also comes with âspringsâ that help create a bounce while you run. You wouldnât notice it at all if they werenât bright orange. However; Iâm in love with them. My knees and hips usually hurt from running longer runs or too many days in a row. This seriously takes that away! Itâs awesome. Youâre not constantly coming down on hard surfaces like cement. I think of it like shocks for a Jeep.I ordered this treadmill off the Nordic site because after some googling I found coupons and they offered better iFit membership deals. I also sprung for the model with the bigger touch screen. Totally worth it. It took over a month to get to me after ordering, which wasnât an issue after reading other reviews and mentally preparing for that. Donât expect it within a week.This is just my personal opinion so if youâre some professional runner and think my opinion is garbage, donât be a snob and comment. *insert nobody cares gif*

I would absolutely recommend this treadmill for low to moderate in-home workouts! For reference, we use our treadmill (2 people) for brisk walking, jogging and running/strength training almost daily.

  So despite deciding not to buy this product, I simply couldn't find anything comparable for the price. Especially not with the trusted brand name. so even though I hated the nonsense they were doing with the ifit, I ordered it anyway. So minus one star because of the iFit controversy, it's amazing how much work they've went to to convince you you can't use this thing without iFit. Seriously, a giant stop sign 8 in across right on the front of the machine that says ""stop, your machine is locked, you must register with iFit"" See the picture. A total lieSo if you're wondering if the other people are correct, they are, you do not need ifit. Place the magnetic safety turn off switch in place, hold down the iFit button for 30 seconds. Machine never asks again, works perfectly. What's funny is, I wanted to try ifit. DummiesOkay, minus second star because of assembly. Yeah I knew it would be a complicated assembly, and that's fine. But I do expect things to fit better. I guess that's just the price we pay for still relying on China to build our products, and yes I know, that will never change. So just remember not to tighten things up until you've got all the screws started other than alignment things it really doesn't go together too bad.If I haven't changed this rating, the equipment works fine.

    Warning: iFit not necessary to activate!
  
",1.0,Ellen S. Martin,"Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  While the treadmill seems like a sturdy piece of exercise equipment and so far seems to run well, we were disgusted by NordicTrack force feeding the iFit subscription and extended warranty to the consumer.  First, it is not necessary to activate the treadmill using iFit, but NordicTrack says nothing about that in their directions, preferring to push the iFit subscription instead by claiming that the user must go through the activation process using iFit, which, after the free month costs $15 a month.  We had to find out via the internet how to activate without iFit.  After spending $600 dollars for the equipment, why should we have to pay to activate it?  Second, in order to simply register the treadmill, you have to bypass their extended warranty offers, which cost money.  It is not intuitive as to where you go to simply register for the basic warranty.  You have to poke around the website to figure out how to register without giving them your credit card! Both of these things are, to my mind, scamming the consumer.  The equipment seem sturdy, moves well, etc, but NordicTrack is not doing themselves any favors by pushing the iFit activation the way they do.  It certainly did not set well with us.

  Very nice for home use. Glad I happened to get this coincidentally right before the state quarantine lock down so weâve gotten a lot of use out of it. Read the manual when you put it together to learn the basic maintenance of it. It seems like a lot of the negative reviews stem from operator error of people not knowing how to fix minor things (like belt alignment) and that causes them a lot of headaches that can be avoided by reading the booklet that comes with it

    Wrong Parts in the box?
  
",1.0,JB,"Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  Delivery was good. I started unpacking this behemoth and putting it together with the wife. We assembled the arms with ease and went to attach the console crossbar...Its 2-3 inches too short.Its not wide enough. I would assume it was packaged with the wrong console. You can't even bend the bars inwards to attach the console (pro-tip: They are metal). So after hours trying to get a hold of Nordictrack we finally spoke to a human. They told my wife she got the wrong department and to call the same number we just called 3 times then hung up on her.  When she called back they were closed.SO....We called Amazon and they are replacing the unit. We tore up the box because its really heavy so we are unsure of how to return it? Hopefully the replacement will be properly engineered and fit together.....I will post again when it is delivered. PS: If you made a video on how to put this together, please do not skip steps so the audience doesn't have to see you wrestle a piece in or screw a screw. Its actually helpful to watch you put it together!!! That's why you made the video right? Took me forever to find a video wherein a person set the piece in question on the arms... and it fit perfectly in the video! So thnx for that.

    Quantum Jump Over My 2004 Treadmill
  
",5.0,James in LaGrange,"Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  I purchased this to replace a treadmill purchased in 2004 and that I heavily used until it wore out.  I ordered the Amazon assembly service when it arrived and highly recommend that service.  Two technicians put it together in 1 hour and it worked perfectly on startup.  I am impressed by the clarity and color of the touch screen that opens when I turn the system on.  It offers a quick-entry workout video program that changes each day and displays images actually recorded at sites all over the world. The belt incline raises and lowers according to the terrain being displayed.  There are also many additional videos available with more different workout scenarios that are impressive in their detail and interest.  An example: a workout with a ""partner"" on the sidewalk along the Seine River in Paris; the workout winds in and out of other runners, pedestrians, sidewalk cafes--a constantly changing scene of visual and audio activity as though I were actually there doing the workout.  This is a fantastic improvement over my old treadmill that only displayed  an oval track and provided no visual stimulation at all. I highly recommend this product.

  Bought the T57 4 years ago. Within a year of buying it, had to get a new motor. The new one was  also faulty and it would shut off after one hour and 40 minutes every damn time.  It was also super noisy!  Less than a year after that, it needed a new Display board.  Now here it is four years later and the motor went out again. I am 62 years old so I am not an avid super athlete you know! They've got some serious problems to figure out. It would be nice to find  A way to contact them by email to discuss my complaints and hope for a miracle whereby they could send me a 50% off coupon if I were to ever buy again. I was on the phone with them earlier today  and on hold for a good hour.

  This review is for the T65 Si updated series. IT IS AWESOME! Was delivered in a timely manner. They called the night before to make sure someone would be home. Helped my husband drag it in the house, ( thank God the box has handles.) It is heavy because of the motor. Everything was in the box, parts tools including the i fit code card for the free 1 yr membership, easy set up online. Itâll ask for your credit card, but will not charge it. Thankfully nothing was damaged, was packed very well. It only took my husband an hr to assemble the treadmill. Average instructions. Very solid machine. We are very very impressed with the console. The 10â HD screen is just as big as my iPad! Touch screen features are very cool. Several classes to choose from on the i fit. Love how the incline and speed automatically adjust with the instructorâs workout pace. Speakers are really not that bad. You can adjust volumes separately on both the instructor and the music in the background at the same time, which is another cool feature. Not a real noisy machine. Am satisfied with the comfort level walking on the belt. This treadmill with the added i fit personal training and wide HD screen has definitely revolutionized the walking/jogging experience! Helps put motivation with disciple in your workout. All in all a very solid, stylish and fun treadmill, was worth paying a little more. Hope this review helps, it took my husband and I a few days of reading reviews to help us decide on the right one. And we did a lot of comparisons as well. We are very happy with our purchase.

  Flex Select.After months of using the treadmill, I love it, except . . .They tout the Flex Select feature. Unfortunately no where do they tell you how to make it softer, or firmer.Called Nordic Trac. They put you into new sales. That persons says they have no idea. I don't know about you, but I would think that customer service would know that, since it's a feature. They refer you to iFit (my favorite scam with Nordic Track).iFit didn't recognize my registration and said they'd only talk to me if I registered the unit. One of the things you need is the serial number. I have no idea where that's at. Ditto, other information.Great. They're selling you a feature, but don't tell you how to use it.

  Great treadmill. Quiet, but that is subjective so check this out: My 12 year old ProForm was so loud I couldn't hear the TV at full volume, with this I can hear fine at 80/100. So, I still have it on the loud side but it is a huge treadmill, I don't know how quiet it's going to get. Assembly wasn't a big deal. The deck was alligned and lubricated from the factory. I was a little turned off that I to register it and download the app to get it to work. You only have to use the app once to activate it. After that it works like any other treadmill. There might be a way to use it without downloading the app first but I couldn't figure it out.I was deciding between the Horizons T101, which I had seen in person, and this, which I had not. I really happy I went with this one.

  I shopped for quite awhile before I finally decided on this treadmill. I just got it last week and I've been on it every day since I got it. It seems very sturdy, is a good size without being too small or too big and is not noisy at all. I have no idea how easy it is to assemble because I paid extra to have them assemble it. I'm not a runner so I don't know what it would be like to run on but so far it's perfect for me just for walking. The only complaint I have about it is when you pause it to go to the bathroom or whatever, you can't re-start it without the clock and distance starting all over but that's not a big deal for me. I just remember how much time I had on it before I get off it. As others have said, to start it without subscribing to I-fit just push the I-fit button for 30 seconds and it will start. NOWHERE does it say this. I found this out from these reviews. So far I am very satisfied.

  Iâm GRATEFUL to previous reviewers who tipped me on how to bypass iFit by pressing the app button down for about 30 seconds. Otherwise, I would have believed all the WARNING signs plastered all over the packaging.  What a SCAM.  Very deceptive, Nordictrack. I thought you were better than that. This may scar your reputation and, frankly, I hope it does. I donât like feeling forced to buy something I simply donât need. I may eventually purchase the iFit module but only when IâM ready.It took my boyfriend an hour to assemble and he said itâs a well built machine. Everything fit as expected.  Iâm pleased so far. Iâve only had it 3 days, so I hope my sentiments are the same at least a year from now.It does squeak and itâs disappointing you canât connect your music via Bluetooth. However, reviewers didnât care for the speakers so Iâm using my AirPods instead.  Despite the highest set volume, I can still hear a little of the squeak.  Thatâs a little annoying.The belt is fantastic! My running shoes donât slip, itâs nice and wide as well as long - Iâm really leggy for someone whoâs only 5â6â.  Aside from the intermittent squeaking, itâs a great platform.Iâm a bit disappointed with the user manual. My console is not the one that is in the manual so Iâm going to have to figure out some of the buttons and features on my own.  I donât know if the console is for an older model or newer model. Iâd hate to think I got an older design. $600 is not small beans.Overall, I am pleased so far.  Iâll remember to update my review in a few months. Hopefully, nothing changes.

  Took about an hour to assemble. Seems to work fine but beware! What they donât tell you is that the iFit subscription isnât a perk, it is a requirement or else the treadmill wonât work. It wonât even work unless the phone is paired with it.  Luckily there is a fix. To get around this, press and hold the iFit button until it resets and then you will be able to use it like a regular treadmill.  You will NOT find the direction to override this anywhere in the instructions. Very  unprofessional for a company with this amount of a presence in the fitness community to scam customers into an unnecessary subscription when they have already spent $600 on this treadmill. I wonât return this because it took too long to assemble, but I will not be buying from preform again.

I hesitated to register for Ifit because i really see no sense in watching someone doing my workouts and paying a yearly fee on top of the hefty price of the machine itself.At first it worked quite nicely to override it and start a manual workout. However a day ago this option was no longer possible and all it allowed you to do is to register for Ifit or increase/decrease the incline.So i ended up basically with a large black brick that is completely useless for 1200 bucks.For me this is enough pain to return the item, and if that is not possible start a class action suite against this company.DO NOT BUY IT!I could not belive

  I've been loyal to the NordicTrack brand for the last 18 years. In that time, I've had two Treadmills (currently an Elite 7700), two Ellipticals (currently an Elite 14.9), and one Upright Bike (GX 4.6 Pro). Except for the no-maintenance/easy-to-assemble bike, I've always had service contracts on my equipment. Why wouldn't I? They're mechanical. Anything mechanical is going to need maintenance and eventually repair. The service contracts I've purchased that are backed by ICON Fitness have ensured that I don't have a huge repair bill when I least want it, and that I don't have to go without my equipment for an extended period of time. And I always enjoy the certified repair people that ICON sends out. I always learn from them. And, at all my homes in those 18 years - Colorado, Michigan, Wisconsin and now back in Colorado - all the service folks have been great to work with. Having the service contract also means I don't have to go out and buy new equipment. Which is good for me because I don't always like the newer versions being offered. I was able to keep my first NordicTrack treadmill for 13 years and that's the one I liked the most. Upon reflection, I'd say the service contract has greatly influenced my loyalty and overall satisfaction.

  Overall I really like the t7.5 S. A few things I think could use improvement.1. Fan is useless. Even at full blast. I'm waiting for a clip-on fan to be delivered.2. The side foot rails seem narrow and I have very small feet. If you have large feet I think you'd either have your feet hanging off or be stepping on the belt.3. The 7"" screen really is small due to black bars in the screen and that the stats appear in a thick bar across the top. I wish I'd sprung for the upgraded model for a larger screen. Or Nordic Track should give you a larger screen. It's not a cheap machine.4. Some of the components feel a little cheap. If you tripped on the front belt cover it feels like it would break.I had no problem with iFit as some other reviewers mentioned and really like the workouts. My only feedback is that there isn't as much to choose from as I had anticipated so I wonder if I'll get bored at some point or if they cycle new ones in regularly.

  The treadmill itself offers a great workout but I do not choose to use the iFit programming. My husband got it for me as a gift so I can exercise indoors and avoid gym fees. It does not take up too much space and is foldable. Amazon provided a technician to assemble the treadmill, which was very helpful. However, the iFit subscription requirement is a downer, so that removes one star. After assembly, we could not use the treadmill until we registered and activated an iFit account. They took our credit card info. We understood we were ordering a 30-day trial of the iFit program, which I never used. Then about a month later I received a âcongratulationsâ email notifying me about my âpurchaseâ of an iFit program subscription. It was a one-year fee of $180 plus tax, which I had not received advance notice of. When I emailed their customer service to attempt to cancel the subscription and get a refund, they said they could only refund a portion (about half) of the amount since I had agreed to their terms earlier. I am very disappointed in this process. It should be an option and not a requirement and consumers should be warned in advance of the additional costs! I also took one star off because I am unable to pause my workout for a couple of minutes (such as when needing to go answer the phone, etc.) and pick up where I left off on the distance, timer, and progress of my workout. I have to start all over each time. I have the treadmill on a mat on carpet and there seems to be too much bounce when I am working out. Other than that, it is a good machine.

Now they refuse to enter my house to pick up this defective machine, despite the fact that they entered my house to deliver and set it up. DO NOT BUY NORDICTRACK. HORRIBLE COMPANY. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE.

  Everything arrived in solid condition. Instructions were fairly straight forward, but really glad I read other reviews warning about the ifit.com registration. Terrible business practice to try and trick your customer into registering for your product, what would make MORE SENSE is to automatically give the customer 30 days free trial without asking for any credit card information...AND THEN, if the customer likes it, he/she can pay for a subscription service. Besides that though, everything seems good.

    Fits My Basic Needs Very Well

  I was looking for a very basic treadmill, to use once in a while- particularly during the winter months.  This is a fine machine for my needs. My needs include brisk to moderate walking 1-3 miles at a go, to sometimes a low jog. I don't really care about any of the exercise settings, though my husband does.  My only gripe- I wish it wasn't so loud.  It's not horribly loud, but I can hear it mildly on the main floor when my husband is walking on it in the open basement.  Nonetheless I would definitely recommend the product so far and possibly buy through Nordic Track instead of Amazon; when I ordered through Nordic Track, I got a ""free"" fourth year warranty included by the representative, instead of the three year that was promoted.  Also- I went ahead and paid for the installation through Nordic Track; well worth the money, in my opinion.

  Okay, Nordic Track, is made by a company, that make treadmills for other people.  First. You don't need those fancy features, the are useless. A place to put your book is all you need.  These things are made for people who don't use them. If you are going to stuble about, at low speed, three times a week it's fine. If you're going to use it five times a week, so it will actually be usefull, it break. Two. You need something with a four horse power motor, and four inch rollers, if your going to use it all. That cost about four thousand bucks, and it will still be needed to repaired, so unless your near a repair station, don't order it.

  Super disappointed in iFit and Nordic Trac. I recently downloaded the iFit ap to use with my Nordic Trac C700 treadmill. The ap told me my treadmill needed an update. I started it and it stopped mid update. Then my treadmill wouldnt turn on. I called Nordic Trac and they told me itâs a common issue with the ap and treadmill, my console got fried and I need to buy a new console for $171! They said because I am outside of the one year warranty I have to pay for their ap frying my console! No way!!! If itâs a common issue that they know about they should fix it! My treadmill worked perfect till I tried to use the iFit ap. Iâm so disappointed that the company wonât replace the console because itâs in issue they knew about. I never would have downloaded the ap if I knew I could fry my console. #nordictrack #ifit

    iFit benefits pros and cons

  This review is more about the iFit applicationFirst the iFit PRO's- The graphics are fabulous- The trainers are also fabulous (Some celebrities show up to)- There is a wide range of workouts for the treadmill- everything from easy hikes to endurance runs... up hill and down hill- if you don't feel like running you don't need to follow the trainer, put it on zero incline and 2.5 speed for an easy walk- Great for the grand parents- You can play your own music or listen to theirs or listen to the trainer or not at all or listen to all 3 each has there own volume controlCONS- It is a subscription service ... I like working out with the trainers so I pay for it; but if you don't want it, there is a manual process and it works- iFit requires an internet WiFi connection- if your WiFi Connection drops, there is no way to get back to the middle of your workout, you would think a programmer could fix that in a couple of hours- Some of the trainers can be a little intimidating when they say keep it up and the machine is going faster then what the trainer is doing (That is when I do not follow the trainer and slow my machine down)- It shows your work out compared to others and you can swear that some person put the treadmill on the fastest highest steepest setting and then jumped off to get their name at the top of the list

  Purchased it from Sears (with a *3 yr Extended Service Plan) on 10/2015.By 01/2016 the FIRST motor finally went. I called NordicTrack and they immediately placed an order for a new motor that I had to install. No problem. It was pretty straight forward.By 09/2016 the SECOND motor went. This time I insisted that they send a technician to install it. He came and replaced it and I was, once again, a power walking madman.Fast forward to today.Motor number THREE has gone. I called to their delight and found out that not only is the treadmill getting a new motor it is also getting:ASSY,LUBE,WLK BELT,D&C,W/RI; WALKING PLATFORM;WALKING BELT;MOTOR BELT;CONTROLLER.All for a grand total of $0.00Moral of the story is to get a gym membership or an Extended Service Plan when purchasing exercise equipment.*Service plan ends 10/2018.
