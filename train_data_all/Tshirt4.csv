    Budget Shirt
  
",3.0,로테군,"Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2021","









  
  
    
  I actually needed a green shirt for a photography session, and the hue that was needed were some of the selection of this brand. Upon buying the shirt, and used it for the session the quality was average at best. The thin nature of the shirt meant that with repeated washing or wear it would tear. I'm somewhat used to more ""thicker"" shirts as I wouldn't buy this thin style of shirt again.

    Gildan White G2000 not made like the Gray G2000 'T' shirts.
  
",1.0,da klein,"Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  Since the Stay-At-Home deal some of us have gained a little weight, so, to keep up with my body type I purchased a bunch of  Gray G2000 'T' shirts. These gray shirts looked and fit great even after machine washing. I decided to buy a bunch of white G2000 'T' shirts to tie-dye. The Gildan White G2000 aren't made like the Gray G2000 'T' shirts.  The gray were a heavier grade cotton, with better stitching et cetera.  So, I thought that I'd get some of the same type in White.  I was extremely disappointed in the quality of the shirts that I received, not only were they of cheaper quality cotton, synthetic thread was used to stitch to shirt which shows up like a spot light (when tie-dyed)because (of course) synthetic thread will not take up Procion MX dye.  If the shirt description states 100% cotton the shirt should be 100% cotton, otherwise the description should state that the shirt stitching is synthetic and not 100% cotton. There should be no difference in quality of materials between the 2 colors of shirts but there was. The difference in a tie-dye between a quality white shirt and the Gilda G2000 is night and day. I feel 'sullied and unclean' for having used the White G2000 'T' shirts. One can be sure that I will no longer use the Gildan product even to clean the floor.So, no i'm not happy with this product at all. Each time I wear one of these shirts i'll be reminded of my disappointment when I see the sleeve, neck and tail stitching.

  When these arrived they seemed awfully stiff.  After washing some of the stiffness disappeared but some remains after 4-5 washings.  Happily they don't feel stiff/scratchy once on.  The fabric is heavier than I expected so they are warmer than expected; I just have to remember not to use them on a warm day.

  One of the shirts arrived a little dirty looking for some reason but I washed them before wearing. They are dark black and didn’t fade or shrink in the wash on both delicate/normal cycles with cold water. I was them often. The fabric is nice and durable, I’m sure they’ll last me awhile.I am a female but I prefer men’s tshirts. In women’s and unisex shirts I’m a Medium size so I ordered a Small. They fit me pretty snug on the arms (I have big arms), but the rest of the shirt fit okay. I will order a Medium next time.I would say they are pretty good quality for the price. Would buy again. I suggest ordering your unisex shirt size.

  Washed it once just a tad bit if shrinkage. I'll know after a few more washes. All I can say is I'm happy I been searching for plain shirts for years. Stumbled across reviews online saying these shirts were good. I enjoy them. I do sweat alot when working though and the sweat really feels weird when it's on the shirt. The sleeve length is perfect. Match happier. Don't buy fruit of the loom or Hanes. These are so much better.

After a few cycles through a washer/dryer the quality becomes unbelievably terrible. The shirts are cheaply manufactured from cheap materials.

  The T-shirts I normally order went way up in price so decided to give these a shot.  I bought a two pack, black, 3XL.  This is a t-shirt that fits well!  Material quality is excellent.  Heavy, but not too heavy of material.  I did wait to write a review until I washed them one time.  I wanted to make sure they did not shrink up too much.  They fit perfect after a wash as well. I will be buying more today.  Highly recommended.

  Headline says it all. If you're looking for a cheap shirt to work in or exercise in or use (like me) to print something on for fun (it was a white elephant gift), then this is your shirt. It's not soft. It's moderately thick and heavy. The crew neck is a little too high for my taste. It served its purpose, but it's not a shirt I'd ever recommend for wearing. It's just a cheap shirt. 3/5 stars isn't because it's bad, just because it's quite average. It doesn't try to sell itself for anything more than it is, or anything less.

  These T's were too short for my husband to wear on his long torso. Also, the cotton was scratchy, not soft, which he would have been able to live with if they fit, but in this case it was just adding insult to injury. Because I put them in a box under the Christmas tree, we didn't discover the fit issue until after I was outside the return window. We just had to give them away. Ugh. If you order, size up.

  As a t-shirt to wear casually, the shirts are fine.  However, they do not work well under a button up shirt as the sleeves are too long.  I've bought Gilden before in a size larger and they shrank just the right amount.  The current ones do not shrink as the others did.  I have to buy as size larger to allow for shrinkage to get just the right size and these didn't do that.

    Solid value T-shirts
  
",5.0,Solomon Kane,"Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2018","









  
  
    
  I recommend these T-shirts. I am 5'8"" and 140"", I do not like tight T-shirts so I bought a large. I am happy with it, although I am sure that a medium would have worked.I will compare the Gilden T-shirt with the Fruit of the Loom Platinum that you will see at Wal-Mart.Pro - The Gilden appears to be better built and the sizing was consistent on the two T-shirts that came in the package. The neck was smaller, without being tight. I am guessing that fabric around the neck will not wrinkle up, unlike many Fruit of the Looms. There were no loose threads, unlike many Fruit of the Loom.  Gilden has heavier fabric, which is better most of the year where I live (east Tennessee). I do not want a see-through T-shirt. Also, no one who sees me would want me wearing a see-through T-shirt.Con - The Fruit of the Loom is much softer after a first washing. I washed the Gildan T-shirt in warm water with two minutes in the dryer on Energy-Saving. Gilden has a tag which is not as good as Fruit of the Loom (no tag). I cut the tag out without any problem and now the Gilden is fine. Gilden is slightly more expensive but both brands are inexpensive.Neutral - Neither brand bleeds color. I have only washed the Gilden one time so I do not know whether it will fade. My Fruit of the Loom T-shirts fade but it takes many washes for that to occur.I hope that this review is helpful to you.Update - June 2, 2020. The Gildan T-shirts that I bought previously held up reasonably well for the money. They did not shrink. They did not fade. However, they did not get softer.  Washing was on warm and drying was three minutes on energy saver.I purchased some more Gildans to replace the ones that wore out.  I have not washed them yet. I bought Galapagos Blue and Orange in Large size. Both are 100% cotton. The necks seem smaller than the Fruit of the Loom Platinums that I own. I like that because I have a small head so I don't need a big neck. I am still 5'8"" and 140 pounds and the Large is comfortable for me. A medium would probably fit me better; however,  I like a looser-fitting T-shirt.I will let you know how well the new Gildans do after washing in warm water and drying for three minutes on energy saving heat.Notably, I have some old Fruit of the Loom T-shirts (like ten years or more) which are reasonably thick, reasonably soft, and still going strong after all this time. I wish that I had bought more of them.June 10, 2020 - After one wash in warm water and three minutes in the dryer, the new Gildans did not shrink or fade. Also, the necks did not stretch. However, the T-shirts did not become softer. Therefore, three out of the four results were good and one result was neutral.September 20, 2020 - After multiple washings in warm water and three minutes in the dryer on ""energy saving"", the verdict is the same. Good - the T-shirts did not shrink or fade and the necks did not stretch. Bad - The T-shirts did not get any softer. One other note - the tags on the T-shirts would be very annoying to wear so I cut the tags out.November 22, 2020 - The first thing to go bad on these T-shirts has been that the necks have stretched slightly. The stretching was not terrible but it is noticeable (at least to me). Nevertheless, I would give the T-shirts 4.5 stars. They do seem a little but softer or maybe I am getting more used to them.  They do not feel scratchy to me. They have not faded or shrunk. I definitely like them much better than the ultra-thin Fruit of the Loom Platinum.November 28, 2020 -  I have purchased only Large-size Gildan T-shirts. I am very happy that the sizing has been very consistent. Gildan has much better quality control than Fruit of the Loom.March 11, 2021 - I have revised the rating to a five stars. The T-shirts have gotten soft after probably 10 - 12 washings. The necks have stretched slightly but not very much. I am picky about that so I may notice that more than most people would. I dry the T-shirts by putting them in the dryer on energy saving setting for three minutes and then laying them on a bamboo drying rack. I do NOT dry them by putting them on hangers. The T-shirts still look great with no fading. I wear them frequently and enjoy the various colors.

  Used to be, ages ago before online shopping, that the big brands (Hanes, Fruit of the Loom) always made reliable t-shirts.  Lately, not so much the case, and it seems to be more difficult to just find a comfortable, quality t-shirt that isn't overpriced.  I rely on these for sleeping, along with a comfy pair of shorts, but my aged t-shirts, from Champion, are wearing out, and I can't find those anymore.So, looking at t-shirts I've liked, that I've bought at sporting events or motorsports events, I noticed a lot of them were Gildan shirts, and all of them were comfortable and durable and fit well.  That's what led me to a search for that brand, and I found these.Ordered them up, and, for an affordable price, they are terrific, and just like the ones for which I pay twenty five bucks or more, when buying emblazoned with a logo or whatever at an event kiosk, so, yup, the same outstanding shirts, just far less pricey.  Now that I've tried these, I'm going to order up some more, and finally retire my old worn out t-shirts that have served me so well all these years.A great find!

  I've worn large tee shirts for most of my adult life, but as I got older I moved up to wearing X-large. Recently, I decided to get healthy and lose some weight. As a result I've had to buy new clothes. I bought Gildan's large tee shirts because I had a good experience with their X-large tee shirts. Much to my dismay the size of the tee shirts seems to vary by color. The large red tee shirt fits me (168 lbs, 5ft. 8 in.) pretty much the same way as my old X-large tee shirts, whereas the dark heather (purchased from Wal-Mart) fits as expected. I'm not sure if it is a quality control issue or differences due to where the item(s) were manufactured. In any case, as they say, let the buyer beware.

  This is the 3rd time I've ordered a 2-pack of these.I did one order in 4x and the other 2 in 5x and either would have been fine. (6'1-295). I've seen regular t-shirts with thin material that shrinks cost three times as much for 4x-5x sizes.These shirts are way better quality than I would have expected, barely shrunk after washing, and fit great. I need something comfortable for work and would have paid more if I had to but it was nice that I didn't

  These shirts seem to be decent quality, although the fabric isn't as soft as I expected.  Unfortunately I won't be able to wear them, because they seem to be about 1 size too small.  I ordered ""large"" which is the size I wear in virtually every other shirt I have (including some Lands End t-shirts I just bought).  So these will just sit in the drawer.

  These t-s are the best heavy- (but not too heavy!) weight all cotton shirts I have ever found, and you cannot beat the price. Nice heft, they are nonetheless soft, hang well and don't cling, yet are classically, perfectly cut. These things launder really well, too. They hold the heft forever; I have one of these t's that is a good 10 years old and it has held the color and body ever since. Perfect when you need an opaque, full coverage, heavier t that breathes well. Genuinely worth it at double + the price.

  ***UPDATE 6/19/2019***I've only had the shirts for about 6 months and both have shrunk and faded significantly. The neck collars have rolled up. I bought these Gildan Dry-blend shirts and the fit is much better, perfect thickness on the shirt itself: (https://www.amazon.com/Gildan-DryBlend-Workwear-T-Shirts-XX-Large/dp/B07CX3XMFT/ref=pd_yo_rr_rp_2/141-5517899-8468140?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=B07CX3XMFT&pd_rd_r=51dfdb89-fe12-47f6-bec1-66f0dbc9851e&pd_rd_w=p22dQ&pd_rd_wg=Jt0Xi&pf_rd_p=5b2bffa6-877f-4dbd-a411-9578bf4fd009&pf_rd_r=8EMXACPZBHN110PMNXFN&psc=1&refRID=8EMXACPZBHN110PMNXFN).

Even the Gildan shirts that I got in a multi pack lasted much longer. If you're a bigger man looking for long lasting undershirts, get the Dryblend shirts or 5 pack instead.Original Review:If you ever used Stafford undershirts from JCPenney then you'll love these! I've searched everywhere for years for black midweight undershirts close to the ones JCPenney used to sell. And I am so glad I gave these from Gildan a shot! The fit is perfect and the shirts aren't see through. They do a good job of hiding your skin! I bought a multipack of undershirts from Gildan but these are definitely thicker! They also last quite a while! No issues with armpit seams tearing of hems rolling up. Great for self-conscious Big & Tall men! I will definitely be ordering more!

  My husband actually has T-shirts older than our college-age grandson.  Some looked as if he was present and against the wall at the Valentine's Day Massacre.  I've slowly been trashing them as he brings them to be laundered and I was looking to replace some of his around-the house T-shirts.  He likes them reasonably soft and medium weight.  I sent off for a set of two of these and he really likes them.  He wore them one right after the other, and the second they had went thru wash and dry cycle, he put them on again.  Which made it appear that he'd been wearing the same shirt (after second wash) for six days.  So, I sent off for 4 more in different colors and he actually scooped up the package and thanked me for getting them for him. He has never thanked me for buying him clothes!  Do soak them in the sink in cold water to make sure the dye is not going to run first.  So far shrinkage was minimum, but I am glad that I purchased on size up.  This isn't dress wear, but these T-shirts are really nice and he wears them almost everywhere he goes.  The colors are great and they look pretty darn good.

  Finally found a nice basic tee made with medium-heavy weight cotton that has some body to it, far better than the tee shirts in stores made of super thin, flimsy fabric, that look like they'll fall apart after a couple of washings. These tee are made with good material, good construction, they have a good fit, and they hold their own shape fairly well.The only con I have is how the sleeves are sewn in at a slight downward angle (compared to my older tee shirts, in which the sleeves are sewn in at more of a right angle to the body of the shirt); this makes the sleeves somewhat restrictive of arm movement as you reach up or out with your arms.But overall, this is a good tee, and I'll be buying more of them, at least until I find some with a better sleeve design.

  I have purchased and worn Gildan cotton tee shirts for many years, decades really. These are disappointing. For specificity, I note these particular shirts were manufactured in Nicaragua, unlike Gildan shirts that I am happy with that were made in other countries.I won't make the mistake of buying Gildan shirts anymore unless I can inspect the garments in person first.I purchased shirts in 3 different colors through two separate orders. I have the same reaction to all shirts in all colors.FABRIC IS A BIT STIFF (award 4 stars): First the good things: Fabric quality is pretty good, though a bit stiffer-feeling than other Gildan tees I currently own. Take off 1 star for stiffness.GOOD STITCHING (award 5 stars): All the sewing and stitching seem to be well executed.VIBRANT COLOR( award 5 stars): The color is vibrant and seems durable after several washings already.UNCOMFORTABLE TAGS IN BACK OF NECK (award 2 stars): The fabric tags at the back of the neck are irritating. I removed them from every shirt. Plus, they are long skinny tags sewn in along one short side, so they always stick up out the back of the neck if not removed.SLEEVE AND WAIST HEMS ROLL UP (award 1 star): The hems on the sleeves and the waist roll up and stay up. They are hard to roll down. The more the shirts are laundered, the worse the rolling and staying rolled becomes. This makes the shirts a real chore to tuck in and unkempt looking at the sleeves when wearing.

  These are the most uncomfortable t-shirts I've ever worn. Imagine wearing a paper bag. I usually wear triblend shirts for work because they are light and extremely comfortable. Maybe it's my fault for thinking 'ultra cotton' meant ultra soft. I would have accepted moderately soft even. They went straight to donation bin. Thankfully they were not expensive.

  Certainly cannot complain about the price, but after decades wearing JCPenney's Stafford premium heavyweight cotton T's, these Gildan Men's Ultra Cotton Adult T-Shirts still are a disappointment.  Penny's was out of stock, so I ordered the Gildans.  They were flagged ""#1 Best Seller,"" but they are certainly not #1 best.  Made of a lightweight cotton fabric, after washing they are noticeably smaller. Also, the laundered seams shrunk and puckered in places, so they do not fit nice. I should have ordered the large size to end up with medium. Perhaps they will survive ten washings.

  With just one wash in warm water and then drying in a warm dryer this shirt shrank so much that it was too short, too tight in the chest, and too tight at the arms.  This is a poor product due to its problems with overall quality.  Most shirts, even 100% cotton don't normally shrink this much unless the cotton is poorly processed.

  Actually one of the better shirts I bought. I definitely recommend purchasing one size up from what you normally wear. I’m a former body builder so I’ve got broad shoulders, a big chest and normally wear a 2X but purchased a 3X per reviews from others recommending to do so. Fits generally good overall. Not the softest shirt I ever owned but I’ve had worse. The shirt is comfortable and not too thick and bulky like other shirts. I’ve got experience with these shirts and after a few washes they get more comfortable over time and last. I wear these shirts often and they’re comfortable to wear out on the town, doing yard work or just laying around the house in.

  I'm a pretty thick on the waist right now, so it's more tight for me around the midsection as a result. This shirt seems to fit better on fit people. If you're looking for it to be loose on the midsection, consider going up a size.I've washed this shirt 2-3 times and it seems to be keeping its shape and size, so that's nice.

  These are the cheap but sturdy t shirts we buy at Michaels for my son to wear while working on his car. Motor oil and grease don't show of course on black t shirts. I ordered from Amazon after not being able to get the size I needed from Michael's. The shipment came in quickly enough. The shirts feel heavy and are well sewn. I don't see any defects. The only con I see is that after washing in cold water with mild detergent, these shirts had a chemical odor. I don't know if it could be the dyeing process or what but the smell is quite strong. It reminds me of ant poison. After washing a second time in warm water and an odor removing liquid, I was able to get a diminished smell. We are going to toss these after my son works on changing his motor oil or work on his engine. I will probably try another order to see if this is just an odd occurance, since I do not see anyone else complaining.

  The shirt color was what I needed more. The quality over all has been really good. They just stain super easy and even with dawn dish soap the stains don't come out. I bought them for my job where I'm unpacking boxes and moving and shifting things. So, the stains are not from food or anything of that nature. Oh well, they were right for the money and work for the job.Also, didn't realize they came as a 2 pack. So, ordered one, thinking one shirt, but there were 2 in the pack. That was very cool.

  My husband is really hard on his work clothes, and I was tired of spending $$ on more expensive work tee shirts that turn into grease rags down the line. Enter these shirts: simple, great quality (MUCH sturdier fabric than I expected), and if they get destroyed by grease/hydraulic fluid/whatever, I’m not going to be too bummed about it. My husband is 6’ and 180lbs with a little bit of a Dad Bod, and the large was a little tighter than most of his same sized shirts so we will size up next time.

  Size 2XL waist and chest are a just little on the loose side for my 40-inch waist and 47-inch chest.  Buts shoulders are very wide with seams that drop down my arms 2+ inches.  And the sleeve holes are a little larger than other t-shirts I have, including some older Gildan Ultra Cotton.  I'd say these would fit well on someone with a 48-50-inch chest, broad shoulders, and big biceps!  If you're between an XL and 2XL, get this shirt in size XL.  I think an XL would fit me perfectly across the shoulders, but might be a little tight across my waist and chest.  What I do like is the heavy cotton material and sleeve length, which is much better than the t-shirts now being sold in stores made of thin, clingy, man-made fabrics with ultra-short sleeves.

  Ok I ordered a set of these shirts because finding 100% cotton shirts is getting harder in the village I live in.  I read the description and ordered a solid color which should be 100% cotton.  After I got them, washed them and wore the first shirt I knew they were not cotton... nope they are 10% polyester.  I cannot stand the way plastic feels nor do I care for how it does not breathe, hence why I look for pure cotton.My advice would be skip this gamble and buy from someone that sells only 100% pure cotton shirts, not this color based content, seriously, different colors have different amounts of cotton and plastic?

  The quality is really lacking (I’ve noticed a decline in product quality over the years).  After sever uses this product starts to come apart at the seams, many loose hanging threads, over stretched neck line (collar).  Again like so many other brands, the tee shirt sleeve are not long enough, the overall tee shirt quickly loses its fresh, new appearance and becomes another old “around the house” work shirt.  I guess in today’s market there are very few true quality products available to the general consumer.  My suggestion is to compare prices and take a chance on the competitors product, it may surprise you in being better quality at a cheaper price.  Brand named definitely don’t mean better products these days, it means they can command top dollar for equal or less equal product quality.

  While it isn't necessarily true that you get what you pay for, this is definitely one of those cases. This T-shirts are cheap, in more than one way. The fabric is 100% cotton, but a coarse, rough cotton, and the cut is slightly awkward. The fabric is not especially thin, probably a little thicker than most shirts I've worn, but the seams fold over themselves more than most shirts. Overall lower in quality than the bulk Gildan shirts I've worn.However, it's not uncomfortable, and the sizing or the shape isn't abnormal enough that it looks weird on me. Despite its flaws, it should considered decent as a value T-shirt, and is certainly acceptable for many people; however, those looking for good quality should consider more expensive options.(Size purchased: medium; on a male height 5'9, weight 160 lb, fit is as expected)

  These are decent all cotton t shirts that for some reason remind me of the way Hanes used to fit.  They are a little loose in the arms, but tighter up in the shoulders so they don't feel quite right.  I am 6' 1"" and about 215 with broad shoulders and this tends to be an issue for me, so I've tried a lot of different T shirts.At this point I prefer the synthetic cotton blends as they tend to hold their size better after washing.  Being all cotton, these wear like the t's I used to buy 10 years ago, and have the same issues after washing.  I gave these a shot because of the price, and because my current favorite, Next Level, is a little tight in the guns for my liking.

I have a suggestion --blame your Primo World Companies for bastardizing the products we have grown to expect. These in fact are closer to t-shirt-thin-burlap than what you would call t-shirt-thin-cotton. Yeah, 2/$8.51 should not elicit much expectation. Well, I really did expect to find those mothlike patches of no-fabric here and there. Not to worry, just a natural part of the disintegration process, I say. So don't blame me, Gildan.

  I was looking to replace some red heathered Mossimo Athletic Fit T-Shirts that I really liked, which apparently they no longer make. Compared to those, the sleeves on these just don't fit nicely; the ends are to wide and they flop around a bit instead of following the curve of the arm. The color is much brighter than the picture which looks to me almost maroon. I got the Antique Cherry Red, and I guess the red does indeed look like a bright artificial cherry red lipstick, with black specs. The threading is in a lighter shade of red, and the overall effect is just blech. Unlike the picture, this also has a white tag on the inside back of the collar, which the Mossimo shirts don't (they have a tagless label). I always have to remove such tags, which sometimes damages the shirt. I ended up returning the 2-pack.

  These Gildan T-shirts are just the right fit for me. And, being a little on the ""hefty"" side, that's not an easy task.I buy the 3X sizes and they're just right: not too tight, not too big. I would describe them as a little loose-fitting on me, but I prefer that. So, if you like a tight fit and you're in between sizes, you may want to opt for the smaller size. Otherwise, they fit just fine. During this pandemic, I've spent more time than I care to admit in ""PJs"" as I now work from home, and I like these shirts so much that I've repurchased them several times in different colors. I really like that you can get so many different color combinations.As for strength of materials, of all these shirts I've purchased (probably over 20), I've never had a shirt rip or tear. I'd definitely recommend these T-shirts. They do the job and at a reasonable price.

  These shirts work well as both undershirts and t-shirts. The material is decently heavy and not see-through, and the fit is not too tight / loose / otherwise unflattering. When worn as an undershirt, they don't feel heavy or suffocating. On top of that, these are inexpensive and available in a number of colors. There is a tag in the back, which is designed to be torn off IIRC, but it hasn't bothered me at all. So far I haven't noticed any shrinkage from laundry.I have also tried the Gildan DryBlend t-shirts. The material on the DryBlends is some kind of synthetic blend which is lighter. It's also a bit transparent, so more suitable as an undershirt and less as a t-shirt. Overall, I would say that I prefer the Ultra Cottons over the DryBlends for both usages. The quality of both seems to be good though.

  I haven't washed these shirts yet, so I cannot comment on their softness yet.  However, upon wearing them right out of the package, I would say that they are slightly scratchy feeling and not super-soft as advertised.  I expect, nevertheless, that after they are washed with fabric softener (perhaps even without) that they will be very soft.  One thing is for certain:  they are very well constructed.  I'm not unhappy even though they do not have the silky smooth texture I was expecting right out of the package.  I am exprcted a better feeling once they have been washed.

Color how ever was my problem on this last one when on my screen looked like a clear set of one blue and one red shirt. What I got however was clearly one blue and one  VERY pink shirt. I pulled up the product on another computer to confirm it is not a monitor issue. The shirt I got is not one that could look red or pink based on lighting....its is full on pink. The shade of the blue one was also off but not as significant. The shirt is sold as ""Heliconia"" which is pink however the shift pictured was red. Lesson learned. Nothing against pink but it doesn't look great on me and is not what I wanted.  Other than the color ( which us a significant issue) there is no other complaints on the shirts.

  First off, I was looking to replace 6 t shirts. I found these and they were an OK price. Pretty good reviews. The material is a bit stiff, but I have noticed that the more you wash them, the softer they are getting.Second, the ends curl up something terrible. I have never had t shirts that curl like them. I just dont think there is enough fabric at the ends to make them not curl.Update: after 6 months, I am disappointed in these. They have done nothing but curl on the sleeves and bottoms. It is irritating. I am going to scrap these and go with some better quality teesOther then the t shirt curl, these are not bad. I think they may run a bit small, or maybe they just shrank a little

  I used to get St Johns Bay colored t shirts at Penneys which I wear as overshirts in the summer.  There are two things I consider musts:  No pocket (uncomfortable and useless) and 100% cotton.  But lately they seem to only have 60% cotton 40% synthetic.  It's easy to get 100% cotton white t shirts in the underwear department, why don't they use the same material for colored t shirts?  I have no idea.I have quite a few of the ones from Penneys but not all the colors I would like.  So I got a couple of 2 packs of these to give them a try.  Note that if you want 100% cotton you have to be careful to choose the colors that are indicated as being 100% cotton and not synthetic blend.They do have labels, but not too big a deal just cut them off as other people have suggested.  What concerned me more is that the cloth feels more coarse than that of the t shirts I am used to.  The whole reason I only get 100% cotton is that I am especially sensitive to discomfort in my clothing. (it's hell if I get a little fragment of a piece of popcorn under my t shirt)But I was pleasantly surprised that these are virtually as comfortable as the all cotton T shirts I already have that use what I guess is a higher thread count material.  In addition, the neck fits perfectly.  The Penneys ones fit pretty well, but some didn't quite feel like a perfect fit.  Another point- they will probably get even a bit softer after they have been washed a few times.  But one washing (I always wash new clothes before wearing) is enough for these to be comfortable.As to shrinkage that some customers mentioned.  I got medium just like the ones I got from Penneys.  They may be just a tad bit tighter coming out of the dryer.  However, pretty close to the same.  I don't find shirts comfortable if they are tight to my skin, so with T shirts, when I put one on, I always stretch it a bit with my hands so they don't hug my stomach or arms.  After doing this, the shirt fit just fine.  And they should be even better after I lose a few pounds which I have got to do.The other good thing about these is that they are cheap.  They are fairly light weight but to me that's a plus since I get them to wear in the hot season of the year.So, bottom line, for me these are keepers.  I will probably buy another 1 or 2 two-packs.I was going to give these 4 stars but I am so picky and these meet so many of my finicky requirements that I figure they've earned 5 stars.

  I really like these T shirts. I followed other commenter’s advice and ordered a size up = 3XL. I am a big guy and was worried that washing would shrink a 2XL. (6ft, 3 inches, 240 lb). These have now been through the wash / dry cycle many times and still look and fit great. Recommended.
