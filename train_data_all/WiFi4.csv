    Wifi slowed way down
  
",1.0 ,DR,"Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2021","









  
  
    
  I tried. Moved it to three different locations in my house and tested it longer than the allowable window for returns, unfortunately. It was definitely easy to set up, but as soon as I set it up each time my kids were yelling at me about lagging Zoom classes and video games, and I found my phone burning through data because it couldn't find wifi in my own house. Maybe it was just a dud, but I'm giving up and looking elsewhere.

  Because of the shelter in place order, both  my husband and I had to stay and work from home. I had to improvise a second office upstairs and the WiFi signal was weak up there. After doing a lot of research and reading reviews, I decided to get this WiFi extender. I knew this situation was going to be temporarily so I didn't want to spend $200 on something I will not use as often long term. I am so glad I got this one. Price is great and it works great as well.PROSGreat price.Very easy to install.Very easy to follow instructions.Great signal.CONS.Really haven't found any yet.

    Not thrilled with this route extender

  The set up of the route extender was not that bad. Was aggravates me about this item is that it knocks my iMac totally off the router signal. My laptop is getting a signal but it is not any better than before. My Roku keeps requesting a WIFI log in when I use it. As soon as I unplug this router extender, everything is working just fine with the exception of the slow internet speed (the reason that I purchased the extender). I thought it was my imagination. I plugged it in and got it to sync with my router just fine, but the same issues occurred again. Returning it.  I work from home and am an online student. I don't have time to play around with this struggle.

  This extender was okay for what we were using it for which was extending our Wi Fi from one room to another. We were having trouble with the built-in router on the cable modem reaching our living room which is only about 20 feet from the router to the computer. We purchased this extender so that we could get a better signal. It worked satisfactory for about 8 months. Now our computers are telling us that the extender is using an older security standard that might not be secure and won't allow the computer to connect. The original router still works and we can connect to it but not the extender. We expected the extender to last more than a few months.

    NO Drops or Poor Signal
  
",5.0 ,M. Scott,"Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  I'm retired and one hobby I have is online poker.  The problem I have is that often I was shown to have a poor signal and then dropped during the game.  I have only had this for 6 days but I have yet to be dropped or even once had a poor signal.  That is amazing to me.  This was not an expensive unit but it did have good reviews.  I didn't have much faith that it would work but I was wrong.  I'm not tech savvy either but all I had to do was press the button on top of the modem and then the one on the unit.  I'm old and a skeptic but either this is the best thing that I have bought in awhile or it is one heck of a coincidence.

  This made the Wi-Fi I had worst.  I followed all the directions, then i connected to the ""Wi-Fi clone"" the internet speed this Wi-Fi clone had was super slow. It loaded a few videos but not without a agonising wait. The hole process of buying it, getting it, then testing it, then finally returning it just felt like a huge waste of time.Keep in mind I had a Ethernet cable connected to it, and both lights were blue. It had direct Wi-Fi yet it still failed. Big thumbs down from me!

  I am thoroughly impressed with this WiFi extender. I’ve used extenders in the past with success but this one takes the cake. I wanted to stick with TP link since I have an Acher C5400X router already. We moved into a new house with a large detached garage roughly 50 yards away from the house. The router is in the center of the house and I have plenty of coverage. But I have spotty 2.4ghz coverage out in the garage.I bought this extender because it was TP link and to help extend my 2.4 signal. It worked better than imagined.1 - it was super easy to setup. I used the tether app and it basically sync my C5400X and the extender. 3 clicks and it was done.2 - I actually placed the extender on the back wall of the garage as a test. The extender picked up an excellent 2.4ghz signal! How??? IDK, but it does. So I left it there. I normally place an extender between the location and the router, but in this case I put the extender at least 50 yards away from the router in a totally different building and the extender got an excellent signal.3 - the tether app is extremely useful. You can use it to test the location of the extender. So basically it will run a signal quality test between the extender and the router. You can also manage the devices connected got the extender and a host of other tools and resources.I’m very please with this extender. I get 100mbps which way too much for my needs. All I really needed it for was to run my Roku in the garage lol. Well my Roku hasn’t buffered since I installed that extender.Pro tip - clone the name of your 2.4ghz SSID. That way you devices will seamlessly float between your main router and extender without you having to reconnect your devices to the extender when in range.

    Whole house wifi
  
",1.0 ,Rose N,"Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2019","









  
  
    
  I purchased this extender so my whole house would have wifi. It worked perfectly fine while we had frontier communications, but frontier was a horrible communication company, my TV only worked 24 days out of 46 and waited 14 days between techs trying to figure out why it kept dropping my signal. So I changed cable company and my husband has been trying for two days to get the extender to connect to the new company. He has been on the phone with a tech that wanted to sell him a product; he's been the company website chatting with a tech, and it's still not working. I would really like a refund and be able to purchase some other product.

  I have a multi-level dwelling and like probably everybody else in a multi-level dwelling, I have reception problems with my wi-fi net at the far ends of the router's range. No more! These babies really juice up the signal! I had another range extender a couple of years back and I never got it working and the tech support web page had been hacked and gave a bogus overseas phone number whose operators tried to engage me in a scam that could have had serious consequences for me and the manufacturer didn't even care when I informed them of the problem. Anyway, the off shoot of that drama meant that I just tried to live with the problem of barely adequate range. Then I saw these TP-Link devices and they were cheap enough to give them a try. Most of the users were reporting good success with them. Well, those ""Five Star"" guys were right. These things work and even a moderately tech savy (classification used loosely) guy like me can have them running in less than ten minutes. Consider me an ADVOCATE!

  So i intentionally waited before posting a review to see how this will work. It has now been a month and this is as great and works as perfectly as almost everyone states. I do feel bad for those that cannot connect right out of the box as it took me literally about 15sec to connect. Press button on router, pressed button on range extender, waited for them to connect and done. My wifi router is located in family room but i now have full bars in all the upstairs area in a single family home. Now for the first week or so it seemed like it would randomly lose signal. I kept seeing my wifi signal on tablets go from 5 bars to 1 randomly. I did have to unplug the extender and reconnect at various times to find the signal.  But after about two weeks it has been working perfectly all the time. Maybe i'm an air head for thinking machines need to get used to each other but has been two weeks now where i have full wifi signal at all times. Anything i am connecting from laptop to tv has full signal. And at this price i can't imagine anything else being better. My wife and i laughed that by some mysterious mystery about a week after this purchase we got an ad from our internet provider for their own range extender for the low low LOW price of $8 a month or purchase for $120. Thank god for amazon and for this product.

  I had trouble with my wifi stability for the longest time before purchasing this extender. I used USB WiFi adapters and a PCIE WiFi card to no avail. I couldn't use ethernet due to my distance from the router either.I took a shot at this, not expecting it to do much. Not only did it cut out my in-game connection issues, but my internet speed improved significantly. I personally use the Ethernet option to connect to my PC, which is extremely simple to set up through the app. I am super satisfied with this purchase, and I'm just glad that this was able to provide me a solution for a reasonable price. Dorm wifi is notoriously bad, but this gets the job done and then goes the extra mile.

  yes, i bought this given how very reasonable the price is compared to the other ""name brand"" wi-fi extenders out there. At the time of this review it was $15.99. I saw 40k reviews on it and thought, ""well, 40k and 4 star rating cant be all bad"", so i made the plunge even though i have more expensive ones in my cart ready for purchase. Bought it, received it and plugged it in and it pretty much set itself up.The Wi-fi is in my office next to the garage and i placed this booster dead center from where the TV and Xbox in the basement and where the signal originates from on the second floor. all of the sudden i can stream HD movies and kids can jump on multiplayer games with no hiccups. The speeds are not as fast in the basement, but that was expected. Doing some basic speed tests on the booster, it drops roughly 15% if you are connected to it....but hey, im totally cool with that now that my deep dark no-wi-fi basement now has internet service.

",5.0 ,Corrado,"Reviewed in the United States August 9, 2016","









  
  
    
  It worked right out of the box, using the WPS button on my router. I then re-positioned the extender in the family room near the sliding doors that lead to my backyard patio, and now I have very good coverage in all my backyard/patio area. Previously, I had poor coverage just walking outside the sliding doors and NO coverage AT ALL in most of the patio area (the router is on the opposite side of the house, behind 4 walls).The speed is decent: about 15Mbps when sitting by the extender and 10Mbps in the farthest section of the patio (about 30ft away from the door).The standard (un-extended) home network delivers 100/120Mbps when you're sitting by the main router and about 40Mbps when sitting where I placed the extender. Some may argue that an output of 10-15Mbps out of an input of 40Mbps is a bad value, but you need to consider that this is an extender so your ""child"" network will always be slower than the ""parent"" Wi-Fi, due to the double hop that your data transfers need to do to reach your router/ISP.You buy this device if you need to extend your coverage, not to boost the speed on an area with low (but stable) coverage.I'm pretty happy so far, I'm looking forward for video and TV streaming when I'm relaxing in the hot tub!

  This has worked perfectly and is super easy to set up and manage with my iPhone!I had a couple dead zones in my rental house that caused the wifi to be awful.  Now with this, I can use wifi everywhere again!  There are a couple of downsides to any Range Extender, if you're gaming on a console or PC, you might have a higher ping or slightly more lag, but I have been able to play most of my games now without problem.  Sometimes webpages are a bit tough to load sometimes, but once they do, the speed is fast.The best part about this is that if it's set up according to the directions, your devices will seamlessly switch between your main router and your extender.Pros:-Kills dead zones-Seamless transition-Easy set up and maintenance (doesn't need very much at all)-FastCons:-Can sometimes add lag to webpages and gaming (as any extender would)

  Honestly this doesn't really work for me and I'm running out if options. I live in a trailer so my house is practically a straight line. My mother and I both work from home but we work on conplete oposite ends of the house. She needs to keep the router in her room because our Comcast was given by the company so obviously, we cant move it. This is why i decided to buy this extender.It had good reviews, so I decided it was the best for me since I'm on a budget and it was easy to install. It worked well for 2 days, then all of a sudden it stopped working. My pc started disconnecting from it randomly, my Xbox has trouble connecting....nothing was working. I cant even play on my Xbox in the comfort of my own room because this stupid thing doesn't work most of the time. It actually pains me to say that these connection problems have made me almost put down my xbox entirely.I havent played for a month and this is because for me to have a decent play session I would have to take all of my consoles, chairs and monitors out of my room and play in the dining room. That's what i have to do to get reliable connection now.If you want my honest to God review, this thing is terrible, spend your money elsewhere. If you're looking for something cheap, just save up until you can spend a little more cash for something worth your time. Do NOT get lured in by all the reviews saying ""oh it's easy to install"" don't let them fool you like they fooled me. Save your money and get a better one.

  I used the app to install since written directions were poorly written. The app confirms it is properly located but I can see absolutely no  improvement as far as distance is concerned. Actually it interferes with my wf-fi! If I am in the garage I get better reception by  turning off the extender link. Often I get NO signal at all when I use the .ext option but turn is off and my connection is restored.  Very inconsistent results but, for sure, NO improvement in my reception. Generally better off without it. Product support was unprofessional and TWICE failed to call me back at the time they promised and then failed to call back at all as promised. Wasting my money is bad enough but wasting so much of my time is insulting. Not worth packing up to return is so I till probably just toss it in the garbage and eat the deal. They have had far more than  a fair change to make good. CAVEAT EMPTOR!

  There is another review on here that says ""This product did not work at all! No difference whatsoever!"".  And that was my INITIAL thought also.  Then I realized that it wasn't set up correctly.  Even though I had a solid blue connection light, and I was able to get sync with my router, it didn't make any difference in signal.  Then I realized that it wasn't really set up correctly.Quick Check - if you see ""TP Link Extender - No Internet Access"" on your list of access points, then you didn't set it up correctly.  That was my situation.  I needed to pull the instructions and go to ""OPTION 2"" of set up instructions.  Five minutes later, it was working correctly, and the TP Link Extender was gone; replaced with ""myWIFIname_Extender"".When I walked into the room with the dead spot, I connected to the ""_Extender"" access point and immediately had full coverage.  In my case, it is transmitting through 3 concrete walls, and about 50 feet.  Our routers couldn't provide a four-bar signal in this room.  With the extender, we no longer have drop outs or poor signal.So it really is an easy product to install -- IF you take your time and read the instructions correctly. :)

  I've been in IT for decades and while this is not my specialty, I've dealt with wifi stuff like this a number of times.

It's probably 75 feet away now. Setup was as simple as could be, press a button on the wifi then the router, wait a few and move the repeater to its new location.One thing to note, it took seconds to connect when next to the router, but a few minutes when it was far. Not a big deal, but at first I thought it didn't reach.As long as it lasts, would definitely buy again. It is in the location the original wifi was located (verizon home wifi), with the original relocated. The reception is definitely better than what the wifi broadcast.

  We live in a three story home and the router being in the basement means that the third floor and opposite sections of the home were without reliable wireless (thanks Verizon Fios 😠).Anyhow, with this nifty little gadget, we now have great wireless coverage in the home. We had previously been unable to use our Amazon Firestick on the main floor, away from the router, but we’ve now placed it on a different floor and it works great.Setup was super easy, too. Just pressed the button and synced it with the Verizon router that we have. Easy peasy

  I live in a really old building with patch reception so didn't really have much hope in this working so great.  So far so good and I love it.  I have it set up nearly 50ft away from the router (It's a big space so that's the best I could do with half way away) and even being separated by an elevator shaft it still manages to work.  In devices I was getting 0 signal from I now have full bars.  Setup was fairly simple but because the original signal is so weak I had to use the plug in method to activate/register the extender.  It works brilliantly but every once in awhile may cut out briefly for a bit.  I noticed that is reduced to nearly none if when I get up in the morning I shut down and restart the router altogether and freshen the signal.  Sometimes if I'm being lazy I'll just unplug the extender for a few seconds and plug back in and everything works back to normal again.  This little device is much more powerful than expected so it defintely deserves my 5 stars.

  The TP-Link Range Extender model RE 200 was easy to set up following the provided instructions to sync it with my router using the sync button on the TP-Link and the sync button on the router.  I had to repeat the syncing procedure twice, which the instructions advised could happen, but both 2.4GB and 5GB bands connected on the second try.  (The well-written, clear instructions described three ways to sync with a router.  I did not try the other two.)  Following the instructions on placement in my home after syncing, it connected to my basement router on both 2.4GB and 5GB bands from the second outlet I plugged it into on the floor above.  had I tried the second location first, it would have connected on the first try.  The device caused static on an FM radio plugged into the outlet I chose, so I plugged in the radio elsewhere in the room, eliminating the static.  I plugged it into an outlet in the back wall of my house to optimize its reach to my back yard patio.  It expanded my WiFi range from the basement router enough to cover my patio with a signal strong enough for all uses but live video chat.  Incidentally, it improved my signal strength to devices on my second floor, a welcome improvement, though not why I bought it.I had meant to buy the newer RE220, which Amazon listed for the same price, and was surprised to receive the RE200.  Probably my error.  I returned the RE200 and bought the RE220, which has a greater range.  I now get my best WiFi signal by keeping my devices logged into the WiFi extender rather than into the router, and it's great to enjoy a video chat and all less demanding WiFi activity from my back yard.

  This is the lowest rating I have ever given on a product, and I feel badly doing so but the reason I am giving only 3 stars is due to the lack of features that I feel really should be included in the software.  It is easy to set up, and works pretty well from what I can tell so far, but the one major disappointment is forcing me to use the same password on the extended network as I am using on the main router connection.  I don't like that.  I like to assign a different password to the extended network as that is the network I share with any friends or family that come over.  That way I am not allowing for anyone to know the password to the main router and therefor restricting access to it.  We all have that geek friend that thinks he/she can set things up better than you can - and this normally is not an issue for me as I said I don't normally give out that password.  Now I am forced to - and it makes no sense.  This is the first extender I have ever used that didn't allow for a different password and it really kind of breaks the product for me.  I went to the TPLink sight and updated the firmware without issue hoping the functionality would have been included but nope.  My only hope is that ddwrt is compatible on this little guy because the performance really is pretty good.

  Although this device is super easy to set up and it worked great for the 1st couple months.  Now it constantly drops the WiFi signal.  Kids are complaining that they cannot use WiFi and essentially the device is NOT performing it's intended task...boost signal.  Huge disappointment. Here's the deal: if you use the super easy WPS configuration, it defaults to an old firmware which does not work.  I was loosing 50% of my bandwidth after the signal boost. After 2.5hrs with TP-Link tech support the process is lengthy and complicated.  You have to unzip the firmware file, follow a ridiculous sequence of steps to configure...

  I don’t like it. Where the issue with that thing is? Easy to explain, easy to understand.No problem connecting the extender to my WiFi network. Even nice you can choose bridge mode or its own ssid. Works both ways. That was the good part which I rated with 5 stars.It connects to the main network over 2.4ghz channel, 20 MHz wide. Can’t be changed, plus if you are using an extender you can’t vary h with the channel widens anyway because of interference. Duh.Everyone connecting to the extreme are using that channel and overcoming it in seconds and the extender is becoming useless because of it.If you are going to use the extender for only a single device or even two not high traffic devices, you wanna buy it.

  We have ours in our garage. The 5ghz signal does not reach the garage in any usable way. The 2.4 reaches the garage at about 55%. So, our RE200 is in 'high speed mode.' That is to say, it grabs the 2.4 signal and extends it on 5ghz band exclusively. We routinely get on the extended 5ghz SSID 25-30 mbs on our download. That may seem slow, but for 2.4 bandwith, that's just 'ok.' If you are in the room with the main router on 2.4 ghz, you may punch up to 40 mbs. Pros: - Options in advanced mode to receive on one band, extend on the other (thus, not losing much bandwith) - Extends reasonably well. - Small footprint - Signal covers a room or two Cons: - No DFS 5ghz channels. - No more firmware support. - No 'router' mode where you can extend a wired connection to create a hotspot. This little unit does some things very specifically and does them decently well. If you are in an area of high traffic on the original 5ghz band's 8 channels, you could be in for a bit of interference and congestion. I recommend configuring it in high speed mode to get as much bandwith as possible out of it. Don't expect massive coverage especially on 5ghz, due to having internal antennas, the best use for the RE200 is to augment a corner of your place that's on the fringe of the signal. Ours i s in the garage and covers that area in addition to the driveway and front porch. By the time your are in the house, the RE200 becomes very weak. Summation: if 20-35mbs download is good enough from the extender, at a cheap price, it's a viable option. If you have a 250mbs package and want that full speed into other parts of your property. I'd look at another option that supports an access point mode that you can get your full bandwith

  These did not work at all for us. I bought two of them, and for two specific reasons. 1) to extend wifi to my son’s room (xbox) and 2) to extend wifi to a wireless security camera on the side of our house.My son not only received an even weaker signal on his xbox, he had problems logging on to anything at all. We unplugged the extenders and sure enough, he got right on. So basically it seemed like the extender was just sucking up the wifi and not actually dispersing any at all or extending it at all.Same situation with the second, i tested the wifi strength in the camera with and without the extender, and with it, it was at percentages lower than without it. So at least for us, these are useless. Id rather spend more $. And for reference, this is a 1900 sq foot 2 story house. Im not trying to run wifi to the “west wing” of a mansion 😂

  Bought this for a good friend having issues with his internet. He had a few minor issues setting it up but is not that different from other routers and repeaters, so I just helped him after he struggled a bit.  The signal strength is not the greatest but is not bad either. The router is in my friend’s basement and he used this one to extend the signal to the garage. He originally placed the repeater directly over the router in the ground floor. However, the signal strength was about the same he was getting from the router but with a minor speed drop. I moved the repeater to the room adjacent to the garage, the signal was too far from the repeater. I moved the repeater within the same room to the wall closer to the router, success. The signal is good through most of the garage. Speed wise, I observed a speed drop of about 10% (from 20mbps to 18mbps), which for a WIFI repeater is not bad. All and all, good repeater.If my review helped you in any way, please let me know by clicking the ""helpful"" button below.  Any questions you may have, feel free to ask… Thank you!

Updating the firmware when new versions come out has not helped this issue. It will sometimes also totally stop broadcasting a signal which requires me to unplug it in order to reset it. I am finally tossing in the towel and looking for a better, reliable range extender.

  It connects to your wifi network and broadcasts it's own. It is simple to set up and configure. Although, if you have a network with static IP addresses or anything advanced, this isn't for you. If you use basic settings and DHCP for everything, it should help extend a wifi network to you with better signal but at the cost of download speeds.In my speed tests, downloading large files from an ethernet connected server, I got about 15MB/sec download when connected to the TP-Link. I got 28MB/sec when connected directly to my main wifi router, even with a much lower signal strength.  When I put the TP-Link into it's ""high speed"" mode, my download speeds were cut in half to about 7MB/sec.I would recommend powerlink networking over this for speed and reliability.

  My Asus RT-N66U router never had great range. Weak to no WIFI signal on the second floor. I added a Liftmaster garage door opener to a detached garage with a WIFI function but couldn't connect due to the weak signal.I was inclined to buy a new and better router, but thought to try this range extended first. So far, a couple months later, it's working great, beyond my expectations.One fellow showed a picture of his turning brown (the plastic body) from excessive heat. Mine so far is warm to the touch.....but not hot. Based on his experience, I will keep an eye on it. The lower portion of the plastic body of my older Sonicare toothbrushes turned a little brown too.With my positive result, I'll keep my Asus router until it breaks as this ""fix"" is working fine.

  It does extend the range of my WiFi so that I can get in my front bedroom that has trouble picking it up from the router. Sometimes it needs to be reset and other times it will pick up what appears to be my wireless printer so I’ll have to turn the printer off to make sure it’s repeating my router signal. Very small print on the device that’s hard for me to see. Easy to plug in and set up though. Many videos on YouTube to show you how. Good device that does a nice job especially for the price.

    Easiest range extender I've ever used.
  
",5.0 ,Jeremy,"Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  I got the AC750 to replace my old Netgear n300. I have moderate to busy wifi usage in my home I would guess. 2 Fire tv's, 2 phones, laptop, 5 Echoes, a few smart switches, some plugs, a dozen or so smart bulbs, cameras, Nest, etc. Having a 1 gig connection with a router in the basement meant my little single band extender was bottle necking hard trying to handle my upstairs. This gets my 5* for 2 reasons.1st: The set up was shockingly easy. I already had my router set how I wanted it. I used the wps method to clone my networks. Instructions could not have been clearer and simpler. I plugged it in, pushed 2 buttons, watched the LED's do exactly what the instructions said they would, and that was it...done...I was floored.2nd: The performance. Instantly a noticeable difference. Most of my devices instantly recognized the ""new"" networks. A couple didn't (switches and cameras mostly). I manually connect the ones that didn't and they were up and running a moment later. This uses beam forming for a faster response for deligating data between both channels and avoiding bottle necking. Not quite as fast as newer MU-MIMO tech but still very precise and comes at a fraction of the price. And the Tether app that comes with it lets me see if anything needs to be tweaked for the best overall performance.If you are hardcore tournament gaming, need massive up and down handling to work from home, or have a basketball team all trying to watch their favorite streams all at once then you probably want to drop $100+ on the biggest and baddest. For what I need in an extender this exceeds my expectations.

  This would not set up easily. I followed the directions using the downloadable app, and it took several tries before our Xbox was able to see the new _ext WiFi signal. It worked for a couple of hours, then the signal disappeared. I did everything I did in the beginning, repeatedly, to no avail. Called customer support, who to their credit answered the phone within a few minutes, and on New Years Day. But the woman had a strong accent and did not speak English well, and I did not speak her language and had trouble understanding her. She walked me through several steps and eventually told me the serviceable range of the repeater is LESS THAN THAT OF MY MODEM, which is a standard Comcast-supplied modem with a range of 100’. The repeater must be located within 15’ of the modem, and the signal travels 60’. So, a 75’ range. 25’ less than the modem itself! Why make such a weak repeater to begin with?

  UPDATE:  This is an update after more than a month of having this in my home.  I downgraded my review to 2 stars and here's why:  I am having a lot of issues with this thing maintaining 5G connection with my router.  It continuously drops out which then causes everything downstairs connected to it, to lose connection.  There is no reason why this should be losing its wifi connection, it is only about 10 feet from my router, nearly directly downstairs.  I actually moved it closer to my router and I'm still having these problems.  I may just get rid of it because the bottom line is it is causing more problems than it solves.  Most of my major devices downstairs do a better job of staying connected to my router even though the signal strength is low.  The only thing I will lose my getting rid of this is the extended range, but it isn't much anyway.  Maybe I will try a different brand...Be warned: during setup if you change the name of the wifi network for this device, you will essentially be creating a DIFFERENT wifi network in your home.  This is not what I expected and probably not what you are expecting.  I thought that this just extended the range of your current network, well...not exactly.  You are actually creating another network with this device, and like I said if you call it something different, you will have to select that network to connect to it.  Therefore you are much better off leaving the network name the same.  That way it shows up as the same network name on your devices that you connect, they will just show whichever has the strongest signal.  The directions that are included don't specifically explain this and they probably should.Besides that:It was very easy to setup, only took a few minutes and if you use the connect buttons on your router and this, it will literally take seconds.  Once it is setup it can be moved from plug to plug and will automatically and quickly re-connect.You can hide it pretty much anywhere, it kind of looks like a nice plug in air freshener.

  This review is for the TP-Link TL-WA855RE 300 Mbps Wi-Fi Range Extender (I notice many reviews under this listing are for other products.). Background:  we have a large area to cover. I bought the Nighthawk router to give us the best possible signal, but there are still areas where coverage could improve.The TP Link WiFi extender was easy to install. (I gave 1 star because it doesn’t work, but installation was easy enough.) I plugged it in 3 ft from my router, paired it with the WPS button on the router and the WPS button on the extender. After going through the expected indicator light changes described in the instructions, I got a steady blue signal indicating successful pairing. I then moved the extender to three separate locations in the house, each time getting the successful pairing steady blue indicator. I shut off my cellular data on my phone, and using the Speedtest app on an IOS device, check the signal with/without the TP-Link WiFi extender, on both 2.4G and 5G bands.  There was zero indication of any improved signal.I then ran through the pairing sequence again to ensure the WiFI extender was properly paired with the router. Then I tested the signal with and without the WiFi extender. Again, there was no indication of any improvement.Some reviews indicated that there would be a duplicate virtual WiFi network rebroadcast by the WiFi extender, and this would be visible as (yournamednetwork).ext.  The instructions (which are brief) did not suggest this would be the case with this iteration of the device. I searched for new network connections with the .ext extension, there were none.This device is simple to set up, the form factor is not obtrusive, it’s easy to visually check the network status. If it actually worked, I would love it. But after many tests and even running through setup again, I found no indication that this improved my WiFi signal.

  I have a 2 story house with a very frustrating WiFi signal up on the second floor (router is on the 1st floor) I have moved the router 3 or 4 times to different area of the home with no success of getting decent signal through out the home. I have had at&t out here 3 or 4 times to rectify the situation and all they do is slap another router in and then leave me to pay someone to set back up all the network perimeters we need set here as we have a home office that is more delicate than the usual home network setup as they don’t support the network setup we require.  I asked them numerous times If there is something I can add onto our router to boost the signal and they always told me NO, they kept saying their new router should have no problem reaching through out your house, and even suggested I don’t buy an add on!Well I have had enough so I purchased this very inexpensive product thinking what can I lose? if it doesn’t work at least I didn’t waste a bunch of money like they told me not to do.So I just plugged this in by WPS setup (very easy) and then found a solid place to plug it in on the second floor where I get strong signal and BAM! I now have signal in one of my rooms I could never get signal in no matter where I put our original router! If this just solved my problem I will be making a formal complaint to at&t. I am tired of so called professionals not knowing what the h*** their talking about.Now this is a little early to say it has fixed all my problems and will update this post if this little jewel has any problems with my office network setup. But if it continues to work so easily, so quickly without any future problems I would say buy this as quick as you can as I just had one of the easiest, quickest, setups with 100 percent results on a 20 dollar piece of equipment I have ever had. I hope this was my answer to my frustration for 3 years now!

  I bought this hoping to get better signal upstairs, and it actually made it worse.

After about 35 min of trying to get it linked, I ended up with less signal.  (See pics) ok so maybe the extender isnt close enough to the router.  So I sit in my front room(not where the router is), link to my standard wifi, I get 118mbps. So I know where I'm at has great signal.  I put the extender in that room.  Sitting in the same spot, where I just got 118, I link to the extender, and I get 17mbps.  So out of curiosity I bring it upstairs, I got 14mbps where I used to get 17. This just wasted an hour of my time.Oh and as far as customer service line. I waited on hold for 18 minutes, just to have them tell me, i won't get a speed increase in my dead zones I'll just get a connection.  Which makes no sense at all.

  The description says it's good for 800sqft. This means that the signal will reliably travel about 16 feet from the antenna and they aren't lying. The speed is also pathetic. Standing next to the extender, I get about 20mbps connected to it. In the same location connected to the router I get over 100mbps. This is with the latest firmware, of course. Before I updated it I could only get about 5mbps. Setup is easy, though, so I guess that's a plus. If you only need to get a signal around a corner I guess this will work.

  I purchased this WiFi extender after installing Blink security cameras around my home and realizing the WiFi wasn’t strong enough to provide a signal on the outside walls of my house. This was one of the cheapest extenders available, so I thought I’d give it a try. I plugged it up in an outlet in my garage and began the installation. To begin, you need to download the device’s app onto your phone. It gives you the option of setting up directly on a website too, but I chose the app option. It was easy to download the app via a QR code they provided. The app walks you thru the installation process step-by-step. From start to finish (unboxing to operational) the setup process took me 8 minutes.After it was installed, my WiFi signal was full strength throughout my house, in my garage, and around the perimeter of my home where all my cameras were installed. Cameras that received no signal previously are now fully operational with no issues. This is definitely worth the money to ensure no weak signals or breaks in signals, especially if you rely on it for something as important as your home security system.

  A lot of reviews complained that this is just a ""repeater"", but this is exactly what the purpose is supposed to be.  If you need something different, you should not be looking at something in this price range.  This product works exactly as it describes - it connects to your existing WiFi and broadcasts another network, which by default is the same name with -EXT added to the end.  You can change the name if you want to as well.  You can also run a wire to this extender, and make it work at a location where you have no WiFi or weak signal.I used mine in the default manner, to connect a Smart Oil Gauge that had trouble connecting to my WiFi router.  Now I have no issues and it connects reliably.  Definitely worth the inexpensive price to make things work.  I plan to use this only for ""utility"" like IOT devices, no phones, computers, etc.

    Exactly the features you need and nothing you don't
  
",5.0 ,Bob Jenkins,"Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2019","









  
  
    
  Short version: When used appropriately, this is a great device at a great price. Simple installation options and useful features. Stronger wireless transceivers than my Netgear cable modem/router. The key here is a lot if not most people don't know how or when to use these devices...so I'll try to help with that below.Long version: Let's assume you're buying this for your home to extend existing WiFi coverage. Before you do anything, conduct an analysis of existing networks in your area and what frequencies and channels they are using. On 2.4GHz, channel 1, 6, and 11 do not overlap. Ideally, you want to be using one of these channels without anyone else nearby using it so go ahead and reconfigure your router to meet that criteria. There aren't any overlapping channels on 5GHz and it may be used less by your neighbors so that could be worth pursuing for you as well. Next, try moving your WiFi router around to find the ideal spot to cover the entire house. If your router has external antenna(s), you can try using a more directional antenna if you think that'll help and your router has connections for it or reorienting existing antennas. If you find a perfect configuration with this that works everywhere in the home, run a new cable to that location for your Internet if necessary and you're done and didn't need this device.Now on to tips for setting up this device. Use a different SSID than your existing one by appending something like ""_EXT"". This will help you troubleshoot any issues in the future and help get you on the right network at the right times. Do upgrade the firmware on it after initial setup. Keep in mind, no affordable repeater seamlessly bounces you to whichever device has the best signal at any given second. That is handled by the client, i.e. your phone, laptop, etc. and it's not always perfect. I haven't tried it, but I think this device can be wired to your router. That is the best way to use this, but may not be required depending on your situation. If extending it using only WiFi, put it somewhere that has decent signal already and will reach to where you're lacking signal.The Power schedule and LED on/off schedules are nice touches. It increased my coverage and bandwidth 5x where I needed it to after an easy 5-10 minute setup including getting the firmware and applying it. I am a former networking professional. I didn't go in to extreme detail because this is a review, not a blog...research anything I mentioned where you have questions and the info is out there. Or have a buddy help you with it or a company that does residential on-site work and don't let them bill you more than an hour and a trip charge.

  I have to jiggle the setup process several times because the OneMesh thing they have with the router (OneMesh integrates the extenders and the main router seamlessly) is awesome but doesn’t play well with security systems that use the WiFi.I also have a router filter that has to be configured.With all those things, it still works it just isn’t super intuitive and easy.If you have iPhones and computers and don’t have a router filter or security system, this works really really well with a TP router. I have the Archer A-7/ A7 or 1750 TP-Link router.Everyone’s situation will be different but I think the signal extension works great, but not as far as I initially expected.  I was hoping for 60ft more of strong signal and got 30. It works for what I need just had hoped to get more. House material and placement have a lot to do with that.I’m happy with it overall.

  This extender is fantastic if you need a little extra boost in your signal. We have a router in the living room and our office is pretty far away so we put this in the office. We always have full bars on our desktop computer with this and it's never faltered. Strangely we even get a quality signal from our extender when our actual WiFi signal is weak  on occasion so I sometimes connect to it instead from far away. It also has an Ethernet connection just in case which I like. I have also moved this around to see how it reconnects and we normally have no problem just plugging it back in and pressing the button to reboot. It is however a little difficult to initially connect to your router, but if you read the instructions thoroughly it will work for you!

  I own a number of TP products so have been pleased with their performance. I've had an issue with wifi upstairs as my router is in the basement.Style: the unit is sleek and relatively sikish so I don't feel bad having it out in the open since there are no ugly antennas. The plugs are non grounded so if you have older outlets without a ground plug, no fear as there is no additional 3rd pin.Setup:  I'll start by saying that setup is  breeze. If you have wps then it's a simple button click to pair. My router did not, since it's ancient, but the extender came with very clear, easy to follow instructions which allowed me to set up in about 10 minutes tops via a quick website login.Range: most important is the range. This worked fansastically. With the router in the basement I was never able to get wifi outside in the backyard or strong service upstairs. With the additional of the extender I am able to get wifi a good way into the backyard for phones, comps, etc. So it passes the range and speed test.Networks: this will offer both 2.4 and 5ghz networks despite whether you have both neworks offered with your router (though also has disable options for eithe.) In other words, my ancient router only has a 2.4 ghz signal and this extender will take that signal and then broadcasts the same network in 5ghz. Alternatively, during setup if your router already has a 5ghz signal, it will ask you to select that network. My suspicion is that if it is acting as a 5ghz extender of a 2.4ghz network it'll have to convert back to 2.4 at some point since the router is the main hub to the modem. That said, not 100% here but it does offer great 5ghz options as wellWired connectivity: did not use this feature but also offers wired connectivity for devices such as Xbox which need a wired port. In other words it'll draw signal from the wifi and create a wired port to plug your device. A neat feature.Device modes: there are two modes, one of which will act as a range extender which simply is a booster of signal and repeater. Using this keeps your wifi network name and password and all your devices won't know anything changed. So no need to change your passwords or re log in. The second option is using the device to create a second network, which, while I didn't use this setting, would imply that a new password and network would be set up (potentially for guests), but use your old network behind the scenes to connect.  That said, no connection issues on the booster and extender feature.Website/app: easy to navigate, easy to use features and good design. Also offers tether app to control and manage the device from your mobile device so very convenient ad well. Will leave it at thisOverall: very happy with the purchase and wound highly recommend to anyone looking for extender or booster.

  I'll admit I've only had this for one day, but what a day it's been. I'd previously gone about 12 days with limited to no wifi in my room. For context, my room is the farthest room back in the house, and it's on the second floor; our router and modem are located on the first floor, close to the front of the house, where the ethernet port is located. Though my other two roommates, whose rooms are closer to the front, were able to get full wifi without this extender, i just couldn't. I spent a grand total of ten minutes (not even, honestly) installing the extender yesterday, and since then, it's been lightspeed fast in my room. I missed this. If this somehow stops working properly, I'll update this review, because it's only been one day, but wow this is nice.

  My wifi coverage on my patio was hit or miss. I would often get cell phone calls dropped when talking on the patio. (I use wifi calling at home because Verizon coverage SUCKS here in my urban neighborhood - verified by Verizon who told me to use wifi calling). I thought adding this wifi range extender was just the solution I needed. I continue to get dropped calls and spotty service on the patio after installing the range extender inside the patio door.UPDATE - After writing the review above, I decided to check in depth as to why the coverage was so bad. I unplugged the extender and checked the wifi coverage without it at the patio door inside the house. It was one bar out of three. I moved the extender closer to my router where I have two bars of coverage. (Obviously in the room with the router is three out of three bars.) Plugging the extender into the outlet where I had two bars of coverage, increased the coverage to three bars. I walked to the patio door and still have three bars of coverage. Outside on the patio it now shows between two and three bars, where before it was between zero and one. This is what the instructions say to do - don't put your wifi extender right by the place where you need coverage, but put it between the location where coverage is needed and the wifi router. This worked for me and I'm increasing the rating from 2 stars to 5 stars.

  I have an L-shaped brick rancher. Our office with the router is at the far end of the L. There is a brick 3-season room at the center. The bedrooms are in the other wing of the house. In the end bedrooms I kept dropping wifi to my phone. No probs with installation of the extender, but no matter where I placed it, I would get the red LED and sometimes it would go green. In the bedrooms I would only get wifi for a few minutes at a time. Not worth the frustration. The signal is much better without the extender. So I have removed it. The cause of this problem may be all the brick in the house...not sure.

  We purchased this wifi extender to be able to stream HD video (Netflix,  Prime Video, etc.) to TV's at the other end of our house. Setup was fairly straightforward, but there were a few setbacks. The first attempt was using the app recommended by the seller. It had connection issues. A call to tech support resulted in being put into a queue for 'the next avaiable' person.  So while waiting we went to our laptop and did the setup there without issues.  Never did speak to support. The extender supports both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. Once setup, we were  able to connect the Roku's at the remote TV's and stream away. Happy with the extender. Setup was less than trivial, but not bad once we were able to connect to the extender.

  It has worked great for about 6 hours now. My router is downstairs and had worked great upstairs with full bars on my phone for over a year. Suddenly even with full bars or almost full it often doesn’t work and I’ll get msgs on my phone saying I have no internet. I purchased this extender because the reviews are good and it’s so affordable. Prices in local stores are about $70 up. Initially it didn’t work for about a week. Set up was easy, I got the two lights on on the extender and I could connect to the extension with my devices but there was no internet. This was confirmed by connecting my laptop to the extender with the cable and using the Tether app which showed no connection from the router but that the router was working. A restart of my router worked instantly and the wifi speed has been great upstairs. Tomorrow morning I will try outside to see how much signal I get out there.

  So I had this product for about a month now and I used it so that I can plug my computer in upstairs and have it tethered to the downstairs router and a bit of wifi boost is always a plus. HOWEVER while the tether part worked wonderfully, it created issues with all my wireless equipment upstairs. It never wanted to release any devices that linked to it so now instead of extending the wifi through out the house, it made all the devices connect to it instead of my downstairs router and thus making the wifi incredibly slow! If you have a smart house (smart bulbs plugs, alexa, etc) do not buy as it will slow the network down to point my google home kept glitching itself out.Tl:dr: only worth it to use as a wireless router, not worth it for wifi tether

  We have some guests coming in a couple of weeks from another state that's going to be camping on our property. What's a Wi-Fi extender so that they could actually have internet access if they needed while they were chanting from the tent Outback. The picture represents approximately 100 to 125 feet of distance from the Wi-Fi extender. I think for the price that is an excellent value since our current louder only gives us about 50 seat maybe 40 feet and radius from the house actually not radius but circumference from the central location of the router. We live in a tiny house which is a metal pole building so that may prohibit some of the distance of the router signal. However I'm sitting typing this review at the range of I'm going to say at least 125'.  I will be trying out Wi-Fi projector to see how it operates with the Wi-Fi extender so stay tuned I may update this review.

  While this extender is only shown as Good"" above, it works fine for me. I set it up in my shop 200 feet from my WiFi router. I have a very slow internet connection (10mps down). This extender not only picks up the signal but allows me to watch videos and stream music in the shop. When I run a speed test in the shop, it's 1 mbs down, the UDP transmission compensates for the slowness and with only very minor lag.

It really has to be named to something else which created a new network which sucks. Don’t buy it.I bought this thing to add an extender for my existing Google Wifi network. I didn't want to buy another Google Wifi device for my network because it's another $100.  I bought this at a fraction of the cost because it had free returns.

  I found the set up to be very easy. Press two buttons and wait for the light to stop blinking and then login to the extended network. I tried it in all kinds of different places around the house and in every single case except for one the Wi-Fi signal from my router was much stronger than the Wi-Fi signal from the extender. The only time that they were similar was when they were in the same room. I finally went to the room where my office is to test it the two signals. As you can see (photos) the higher one is with my router and the lower one is when I connect to the extender. The router basically makes my signal worse and I’m better off without it. I’m very disappointed. I know it was only $20, but if it makes my signal 1/3 of what I could get without it what’s the point? I’ve already arranged to returned it. Maybe it will work for you? Are you feeling lucky?

  I am not one to leave reviews, but after seeing how this little guy works, I headed straight here to leave one.My son upgraded his computer to a nice gaming setup, and because of our home layout (we rent, so not much we can do about it) our modem/router is on one side of the house and he is on the other.  Needless to say, constant lag and spotty connection.  I was prepared to ask the landlord if I could pay to have a line installed on the other side of the house when a friend recommended this.It is easy to set up, with multiple ways to do so.  I used the WPS option, which literally involved pushing a button on the router and then one on the device.  In 5 minutes, it was ready to go.  Moved it to a halfway point between the router and his room and within another 5 minutes, this little dude was showing full signal strength and was fully functional.Check the bedroom computer and he's at full signal as well.  I expected it to make a difference,  but this far exceeded my expectations.Easy to set up, effective signal boosting - this item is worth every penny.

  Like most Wifi devices, it takes a little to get it on your wifi network.  Like bluetooth headphones, it has to do this without a display or way to ""see"" what its doing while you do this.  This device was easy to connect with the WPS option on it and my router. It immediately came up on my phone and tablet and uses the same password as the primary router you are connecting it to.  The signal is very strong. The only drawback is that it now extends off of my property and out to the street, so a hacker driving by will now have a strong signal to try to get into my network. My main router is in the back of the house, but my bedroom is in the front, so its a risk-reward issue. Plus I have good security on my network.  So it was exactly what I was expecting, and worked just the way I wanted. Very pleased.

  The TP-Link N300 was super simple to set up, assuming you have a WPS button. Plugin the extender close to the router, hit the WAP button on the router and then on the extender, wait for the blue light to be steady and it's programmed. Now go put it where you need your signal extended and plug it back in and you're done. It will create a new wireless name (""original_EXT"") that you'll need to connect to.I have a metal shop that is 50' from the house. I didn't have any signal inside the shop. I put the extender in the garage (closest point to the shop) and now I can get 1-2 bars in the shop. My download speed is about 25% of the speed from my home router but that is sufficient for my needs.

  Spotty signal problem.  Router located in FR on shelving  and using a laptop in LR which was located on an ""L"" path of 40' and then a 20' right.  Signal was spotty on any given day and web pages would crash.  Bought extender knowing it will divide bandwidth in 1/2.  Plugged tp-link into power bar near router and pressed WPS button on both router and extender.  5 minutes later both bands were lit.  Unplugged it and moved it 40' to an outlet and within 3 minutes I had 3 green lights and laptop appears to be happy.  N.B.  The laptop is a yoga2 ultrabook with Win10 and in the FR a speed test running on battery would score 140/11.85 & in the LR 44/11.42.  The extender trades off speed and yet its location is far from perfect with a grand piano adjacent.  It appears the router delivers a bit more than 1/2 to the extender and the extender delivers roughly 1/2 to the laptop.  Or a 1/3rd, 1/3rd of bandwidth available.  Roughly.  The upload speeds are not diminished in any way.  Remember to use WPS right out of the box adjacent to the router and then re-locate and think line of sight for optimal performance.

  The documentation, app and web interface is extremely lacking.  It works once you are able to get into the configuration, that alone is a nightmare. The Tether app tells you to 'connect' through the web interface and go back to the app. Well, the web interface doesn't work on a phone. You create a password then it tells you to login with the password you just created and it just keeps prompting you for the password over and over again. The app tells you that you are not connected. The way I got around this was to connect to the device through my PC's wifi and use a regular desktop browser.  - There is ZERO documentation on the Access Point feature. 3 hours and numerous factory resets later it is in place and working fine.

  This is a great little product. It works fairly well, though it has issues where a strong signal must be maintained like with gaming or wifi calling.  Also, it uses a dedicated channel and so my wifi will often switch between this and the other channel when a channel is lost, but then not connect back, despite being very weak even when I return to the room with my main router. Then I'm left with a very weak signal and must manually switch back. I'm sure they would make it all one network if that was easy, but it is probably impossible. Still a nice product.

  I bought 2 of these at once a while back when they were on sale and for the first week or so of using one of them it worked fine but, then as time went on it started randomly losing connection and then after a while it would reboot itself or start working again on it's own.  This has been a random thing for the past 3 weeks.  Then I decide last weekend to open the other new one and set it up to replace the first one that wasn't working reliably.  The second one is not acting right during the setup process for some reason.  The first one set up super easily and I was impressed with how easy it was to set it up manually simply by using a laptop connecting to it over wi-fi.  Super easy to connect it to the wireless router and then create the extended network and easy to update the firmware.  I have reset this second one several times trying to get it to where I can just update the firmware which I hope will resolve what ever issue it has but, I can't get it to cooperate.  I ran out of time this past weekend and will mess with it some more this next weekend but, I don't hold out much hope.  So my words of advice are to spend a bit more money for a more reliable wi-fi extender.

  I needed an extender to boost the signal to one of my Blink XT2 cameras.  First I tried an extender from NETGEAR at the whopping price of $169.  After two frustrating days of repeated setup it would drop the backhaul signal within 10 minutes of moving to the desired in- range location.  I returned it to the retail store completely frustrated.  I found the TP-Link RE 200 bundled with a WYZE camera at an unbeatable low price.  I added to my cart with very low expectations.  Setup was a breeze.  I held my breath and moved it to the garage.  The location function in the app showed it was in an excellent location.  I used the high speed option to use the 5ghz connection as the backhaul for the 2.4ghz channel.  Along came a firmware update which I reluctantly installed thinking this extender is working so well I don’t want to mess it up.  It has run flawlessly in my garage.  Not once has it lost the signal from the router.  The signal to the camera is now five bars instead of one.  My car easily connects to it for navigation updates. My iPhone connects when located closer than the router.  Even my Ring doorbell has a strong connection reporting a RSSI of -34. All using one network SSID.  I’m considering buying another one for an Ethernet connection required where I can’t run cable

  So I’ve had WiFi extenders before anybody even knew they were a thing. Not a brag just saying I’ve had years of experience with them. The early ones could be a hassle to get it connected to your WiFi but when they did oooh doggies boy did they amplify the signal.  So TPLink has taken care of one issue but added another all while skimping on the whole reason to buy the thing: amplified WiFi coverage.  I get worried so to be brief: they simplified connecting your router to the unit. They made that very easy.  The extra issue they’ve added is one of the ways they made it easy was to use their tether app. It connects quickly and lets you monitor who all is connected. The problem is you have to agree to a privacy policy that would choke a horse but you can always use another method to connect and not use the app.  As for WiFi coverage I need this  because I’m in a guest house with the router in the main house. In the past the other WiFi extenders I have used in the same house with the same router I was able to connect them in the middle of the house no problem allowing them to amplify the WiFi everywhere. Although this unit was able to connect to the router and get set up where I normally keep it it, when it came time to use it I could not get the solid red light (too far from router) to turn off and turn solid blue (close enough to router) until I took it outside and had to run an extension cord to the garage for it to work. So yes it extends the WiFi but only to half of the house I could get a signal from the main router from anyway. Not as strong a signal but I could still connect.  Overall I’ll trade the easy set up for a real WiFi extenders that can latch onto a weak router signal, pump that baby up and blast it across the house.  This is the equivalent of low water pressure in your shower. Yeah it gets you wet but barely and not in the places you need it to.

  it is only a 2.4ghz band which if you don't know the 2.4 is range and a 5ghz is for speed. My samsung tv usually disconnects from the internet the next day and its a pain to enter the pass. So I use this extender downstairs with a ethernet cable connecting the tv with this extender to keep it connect to the tv. While the modern is upstairs usually downstairs has slowing connection speeds. So, I can also connect to the extender that is downstairs with my devices to get the best internet.  Pretty good device to extend the internet range. If you want to extend for gaming get a dual 5ghz and connect it with an ethernet cable with your pc and it should work if the internet connection isn't reaching that far.

That was a big part of the problem, also to just go ahead and reboot your router. I think that would be much better than messing around with the guesswork.The actual setup was pretty easy.It does seem to have made my internet somewhat faster. At least on my iPad.

  Instructions are pretty straightforward and easy to understand. I tried the 3 different ways to pair it to my home modem, using my cellphone was the easiest and fastest way to connect for me. Make sure to rename your device because the instructions will not tell you to rename it.  Moved it to an area to cover my weak WIFI spot in my home. Connected 2 devices in that room and connection was easy and no issues.  Two days later my devices are not working and can't use the WIFI. They are connected to the extender but ""there is a problem with connection"", I easily fixed this problem by unplugging the extender. My 2 devices are connected again. But this issue keeps happening every few days. I'm okay with that but last time it happened I can't connect no matter how many times I unplug it. I even reset the device and then going through the whole thing of setting it up all over again.  This temporarily fixed the issue and the same issue kept happening every few days. I can't take this because my devices that connect to the extender are WIFI cameras and they are pretty much useless if they can't connect.

  I was obviously looking to extend my ISP provided Wi-Fi signal to help with some outdoor security cameras I installed.  The extender is on the main floor of my home about 20' away from my router.Pros: very simply to setup. It helps my Wi-Fi to reach the exterior camera that was struggling to detect my router.Cons: doesn't recover from a power blip well. Has to be unplugged/plugged back in and of course only when you notice.  Another exterior camera that is roughly 20' away with nearly line of sight, isn't able to detect a strong signal so the range of the extender seems pretty limited which is an obvious bummer considering its purpose.Overall, I was able to accomplish my purpose but based on other reviews, was hoping for a much stronger signal at greater distances.  Would recommend if trying to extend a signal in an open space but am skeptical it would function well through multiple walls/floors of a home.

By the time I got to the outside room, it was mostly gone.  I tried different outlets, as it is suggested, and to no avail.  I did return it, and that was pretty easy, just took some time out of the day.  But the return process was over all pretty easy.

  Bought this to extend my signal in my bedroom and my backyard.  Setup was very easy.  The app makes that process go quick.  It defaults to create an extended secondary WiFi network not for instance my main WiFi SSID is micasa and after setup it created micasa_ext.  So that means if you want to connect you’d have to select that SSID from any device associated to your original.  Not very useful right?  But I thought maybe I can balance my devices and help speed.  For instance all kids devices go to the EXT signal.Here’s the bottom line, whether EXT or if I make the device broadcast the same SSID as my main router the speed sucks.  Like really bad.  Netflix buffers, pages take long.  It’s like you can see in your mind nytimes.com jump from your phone through this device, think, then go to my other router, then my internet router and out to the world and then come back.  It’s slow.  It’s bad.  I wish I could return it and get my money back.  But I just don’t have the energy.$18 down the hole.  I wouldn’t suggest this.  You get what you pay for.  If you have internet speeds slower than 15 mbps you probably won’t see a difference.  Otherwise invest in something more expensive with a reputable name brand.

  I was extremely surprise at how easy this thing was to set up, you have three different options: By pressing the WPS button, using the app (I personally recommend using this method), or via a browser. It's super easy to install, I think anyone could do it.As for the wifi signal, don't expect this to be as fast as your router. Using this will also create a lot of latency, so loading things make acutally take longer even though you may have a faster download speed. I totally DO NOT recommend this for gamers, the ping you get with this is unbearable. However, for the average user who needs a better connection somewhere in their house, I totally recommend this. There are a few things you should keep in mind though1. - It is only up to 300mbps, so if you are paying for anything more, you won't be achieving full potential, even though I have 600mbps and the most I got with this thing was 50mbps (with a ethernet connection from the plug into my computer).2. - It only emits a 2.4Ghz signal: If you did not know there are two frequencies Wi-Fi operates at, there's 2.4, and 5.0 . 5.0 is much faster but does not travel as far or as efficiently, and 2.4 is much slower but has a much larger range. So again, if you need anything more than 20-30mbps this is not the product for you. For the average Joe, who just needs to browse his email or maybe watch a video or to, this works great for any dead zones of your house.All in all, I would recommend this to anyone who doesnt need blazing fast speeds or good ping/latency and just wants to patch up any dead zones of your house.

My streams are flawless. It has his work cut out for it since we have about 10 devices in the room for it to magnify the signal. But it does it beautifully with its dual capacity. The indicator lights give you an idea on how well the unit is operating. It syncs up with your router with just a press of a button. Once all the indicator lights have litten up then the extender is ready for relocation. Once you get to your location just simply plug it in and it does the rest.

Of the 3 we bought, this was the cheapest, the easiest to set up, and extends further than it claims. We use a nighthawk router and the extender is about 50ft away through a brick wall and through a aluminum sided garage wall.  It supplies WiFi to 3 cameras.  The furthest camera in the alley is 50ft away from the extender all on the outside of the aluminum sided garage again.If that sounds even remotely like your situation, I say do it.

  Setup went well.  No complaints.One disappointment:  I had expected the extender to function anywhere that I had a usable WIFI signal to work with.  I had thought I could place it in a weaker area of our house (two or three bars) and have it boost the signal to a full four bars.  This is not the case.  To be fully functional (both lights steady blue), the extender must be in a very strong (four bar) area of my primary router - perhaps within 20-25 feet.  This limits the useful range.  Also, confusing, is that beyond the four bar range of the primary router, a steady blue and red light state may be present.  And in this steady blue and red state, the extender still seems to function.  This may usefully extend the range of the extender, but the instructions do not discuss blue and red lights.  What does steady blue and red mean?  I do not have the tools to determine if this blue and red state is fully functional, so I am placing the extender in the blue-blue range.  A little farther from the primary router (one or two bars), the signal light goes out completely.  Three states: Blue-blue, all is good, blue-red ??, and blue only, does not function.Otherwise, the extender seems to solve my problem.

  I have the TP-Link | N300 WiFi Range Extender for my computer. This is working great after having 2 days of trying think why there was no difference in reception with it versus using my router without it.  I suggest watching the video on their website FIRST before installing the product.  My mistake was I entered the same name for the extender as for the router.  So the device acted as though just router was available.  I did use their chat service 4 times but you end up getting disconnected from them when you have reconnect to the router.  Anyway, had I watched the video first then read the direction not vice-versa, I would not have made the mistakes.  Now it works great!  I use this for my All-in-One computer that only as a 2.4 GHz 801.11b/n capabilities.  I did reset my Wi-Fi router to 801.11n to help give a little more speed.  I am averaging 20.Mbps download with anywhere from 6.5 - 11 upload speeds.  Can now watch HD movies without any hiccups along the way.  I had to place my extender on my desk behind my computer.

  This was incredibly easy to set up.  Simply plugging it in close to my router, and hitting the WPS button first on the router, then the button on top of this extender.  Once the light goes to solid, you simply need to move it to the outlet you wish to help extend throughout your house.Connecting to the extender is easy, as it has my typical router name on it, plus the letters ""EXT"".  I had no issues connecting my Smart TV, laptop, and phone to the extender.  I also have no issues with  connection while using.This is a great affordable option for extending your signal, should you have some dead zones in your house.

  Tried in three different configurations:1. Plugged it into a wall half way between router and ""dead spot"" (devices far from router)... degraded connectivity by ~40%2. Plugged it into a wall right next to the router... degraded connectivity by ~75%3. Plugged into a wall directly near the devices in the ""Dead spot"" and ran an ethernet into the device. This resulted in killing all wifi in our entire house, regardless of whether we used the extender or the original router. The connection was at 0.1 mb/s or would not connect at all.Complete failure, don't waste your money.

  Wi-Fi network not secure in Windows 10Applies to: Windows 10You might see a notification that tells you that you’re connected to a Wi-Fi network that’s not secure because it uses an older security standard. For example, this can occur if you connect to a Wi-Fi network that uses WEP or TKIP for security. These security standards are older and have known flaws.To fix this issue, do one or more of the following:  If there’s another Wi-Fi network that’s in range that you recognize and trust, disconnect from your current Wi-Fi network, then connect to the other one. For more info, see Connect to a Wi-Fi network in Windows 10.  If you’re connecting to your home Wi-Fi network, consider changing the type of security that your router or access point uses. You can do this by signing in to your router using the software for it, and then changing the security type for your home Wi-Fi network. For more info, see the documentation for your router or Setting up a wireless network.  If you have an older router or access point, you could also consider getting a newer router that supports the latest security standards and improvements.Will update review if I end up getting help that causes these things (we bought 2) to function properly.

  It was easy to setup and really did extend the range well, WHEN CONNECTED.  I finally setup a simple test case to eliminate potential blockage and any doubt about range. I am sitting in my family room with the extender in the same room.  The router is within 20 feet, nothing but a couple sheet rock walls in between.  About half the time I cannot connect.  I keep getting the no internet connection.  In every case, I unplug it and get connected immediately.  Kept restarting and it works for a while but devices that almost never have a connection problem are not connecting.  It is great to get a signal boost, but it does not mean much when your connection reliability is in the cellar.

",2.0 ,C.Bat,"Reviewed in the United States November 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  First of all, as some others have said, this does not “boost” your Wifi signal; it allows you to create a second point of connectivity, which means a different network you’re going to have to long into with your devices. It’ll take your existing login and add “_ext” to it, but you have to connect each device to that alternate network. That being said, smart TVs (at least the Vizio I have) will not connect to it. That was the entire reason for my purchase was to connect my smart tv and also my PlayStation to it for streaming and gaming. Neither device will connect. My phone connects to it, but I don’t have any existing issues with my phone. The only reason I gave this two stars is due to the fact it would work to create WiFi from a wired connection if someone didn’t have WiFi already. The setup is easy enough, but I was alerted on my phone that the connection is not secure even with an app password they make you create. I got a couple warnings on my phone about security risks from an unsecure network. As you can see in the photos, it says weak security.

  I'll update my review should anything change. Received this item two days ago, set it up for the first time last night. Set up was reasonably straight forward and easy, the instructions give you three methods, I used the app. And I think the device is working, the app says there's a connection, and I am connected to this new ""extended"" wifi network. I just don't think that to this point it's giving me a very good signal. In fact, I think my normal non extended wifi network works better than this new one. So, that sort of defeats the purpose of the item, as I purchased it to improve the lackluster signal I receive in the back of my house where my bedroom is located. Again, I want to be fair and I'll update this should the signal improve, but so far it's not great.

  I wasn't sure if this was going to work. But I've used this brand before in the past. And their products haven't failed me yet. The cost was really low and it was returnable so I gave it a try. I'm so glad that I did! The rest of the house my speeds are great. The problem room was my bedroom. Every device when used in the bedroom the signal strength was 25 Mbps. Very weak and slow. Streaming on my smart TV would buffer and lag. Now after using the extender my speeds have more than tripled to 76 Mbps! I didn't think it was possible so for a week I kept testing it to be sure. And each time the numbers were consistently up. The instructions were clear and connecting was a breeze. Took me about 10 mins for the entire process. I plugged mines up in a surge protector that is hidden under my shoe rack. Works great and still going strong!

  I’m really really hoping and praying that writing this review isn’t going to jinx me , which is typically what happens with me and routers. I bought this extender because my router is on the back side of ‘my 2200 sq/f house & my security cameras were finicky being outside on the opposite side of the house. This solved the problem, plus the rooms in the dead zone finally get a signal, so my guest room streaming stick doesn’t buffer like crazy anymore.One down side is that it’s basically a separate network so depending on where you’re at in the house you’ll need to manually change to the nearest network. Frankly I just don’t use this network for personal use, as I’m rarely on that side of the house so it’s not a big deal to me, but if you’re looking for a repeater rather than an extender, then this isn’t the right product for you. However for the price I am very pleased.

There is no warranty, they just tie you up on the phone for hours with people that probably make a dollar an hour wo you give up. Never, Never Never againI had given this rave reviews until 4 months in, then. it failed. Ok things break, but now to get service.OMG as they say. First of all, you need to register you device to get service. So I go to register and it tells me my serial number does not exist. After searching online, I find this is a regular problem with TP link. So the get this cleared up they tall you to call. Forget about calling them. Very long waitSo I tried a chat. The chat process does everything they can to avoid you chatting. but after several things I did, I got through. Then the person you chatting with must be having 10 conversations going on at once as there is about a 4 minute wait between answers.So now they want a picture of my product showing the serial number and proof of purchase. Hey, no problem right. But I get it done. And now I am told, they put my serial number in, but I have to go back and register it before I can start the return process. Well, that took 1 hour. I can imagine what the return process is going to be. So I think for 20 bucks, I will eat it and avoid TP link products for ever. You should too.,Update. I had time to register my product and now I tried to return it. 53 minutes on the phone with a tech support person doing all kinds of stuff for them and still not working. Now instead of letting me return it, I have to wait as they are escalating this to a higher tier support person and they will get back to me. This is a joke and so is TP Link.

  I bought this WiFi extender to help get a stronger signal to the upstairs level of my 2 story townhouse. The WiFi router is literally right underneath the new extender upstairs. I barely managed to get 12 Mbps when I run a speedtest with my phone practically touching the extender antenna. Change or plans, I decided to keep this extender downstairs, run an Ethernet cable from my WiFi router to the new location for the extender so it can receive high speed up to that point and the rest is wifi to my kids rooms above the extender. For reference, my WiFi router speedtest shows 175-190Mbps, at the extender with my phone literally right there, and it's hard wired to my router, I hit a max of 54Mbps.Short of it is, does it work? Yes.Is it as fast as claimed (100Mbps)? No.I can't imagine how it can ever hit 100Mbps considering that with my setup, it should be able to hit that speed easily, since it's literally hardwired to my router with Cat 5 cable, but it can't. When I measure the speed upstairs in my kids rooms, I'm hitting max 17-20Mbps.If you're not using a gaming consul and simply streaming music and such on Alexa, then no problem. I have no other experience with extenders to compare. All I have are my speed measurements and my expectation was it should hit 100Mbps.

  This pretty much did the opposite of what it's supposed to do!  I tried moving it to a few different locations in the house but with the exact same results.  Setup was easy, but that doesn't really matter when it cuts your speed in half.I moved into a two story home where the hookup for internet in my office turns out to be non-functional.  I may have it replaced down the road, but on the second story of a house it's expensive.  I thought this would be the perfect solution as I'm having to run my PC off of wifi when I'm used to using it hard-wired.  The location where I had to plug up the modem is downstairs and opposite part of the home from the office - go figure.  I'm paying for 150mbps, and get about that when I try hardwiring my laptop onto the modem directly.  But my desktop in the office gets 30mbps on a good day which is awful.  It's not my PC as I've tested this with other devices with the same results.After looking at several of these extenders I thought this one would be great to try as the cost is so much lower than most; now I know why!  I got it hooked up and was super excited to try it out - ran a speed test and came up with under 15mbps!  I then unplugged it and put the PC back onto wifi connection with the modem and right back up to around 30mbps.  Tried a few different spots in the house with exact same results.  Going to spring for a more expensive one in a different brand now that I've returned it.

  Set-up on these devices is pretty straight-forward.  I managed to extend my wifi using one unit on the top floor, then drop a second unit downstairs to extend the first unit.  After a week's worth of use, I no longer had internet connectivity.  Reboot.  Ahh... there's the internet.  No useful info in logs as to why the devices went autistic.  Nothing helpful on the support site either.Firmware doesn't match the support articles (dated 2018) so that's no help when you're trouble shooting as complete menu options referencing the ""solution""  no longer exist in the current firmware.NAS devices don't stay ""online"" requiring several seconds to reconnect every few seconds making streaming impossible.  Don't see what anyone would use these for as I can't think of a use scenario when I require intermittent or random connectivity cycles.Yeah.  These are garbage and utterly worth the sub-$20 price.  Will be pitching these into the trash where they belong and looking for another option.  Preferably, one that works as advertised.[update]Well, devices no longer issue IP's which is kind of what they're made for.  New devices connecting to the TP-link  just hang indefinitely.  Plus it seems like there's a limit (single digits) to the number of devices you can attach.  Every time I boot an extender, it's a random event to see which of the six NAS devices won't make it onto the network.Seriously.  Save your money.  Or, go out to the back yard and scoop up a small handful of dog droppings and plug your devices into that;  it's more honest that way and you'll maintain the functionality.

  I followed all the instructions, connected with the app, then went to plug it in to where I wanted it to boost from. At first, I couldn't connect to the extender. I reset it and tried to reconnect several times. It kept defaulting to the extension name on the wireless signal list, so I'm not confident that resetting it actually cleared the data out on it. When I finally thought I had it all figured out, I tried to connect to it again and the option for the extender vanished from my wifi connections list. I looked for comments with similar problems and the manufacturer says that the names merge, so it will just look like my regular wifi connection. I was running a connectivity app the whole time and saw no improvement over my connection, EXCEPT when I pulled the extender out of the wall and it bumped my connectivity up a smidge.

  This was an Amazon Warehous purchase, so of course, it came without any instructions. Still, using wps setup should have been easy. It wasn't. At first I couldn't get the wps button to illuminate, so I finally did a reset and tried again. Still no luck. I finally did get it to illuminate after a few more tries, but it refsed to link to my router. Finally, I tried holding thereset button while powering up the unit, and that was the magic combination. Got it linked , moved it to the area I needed a stronger signal in, and now all is good. I should note that I did go online to look up the manual for the unit, but, quite frankly, TPLinks instructions rather stink, despite being rater long. Ther ""quick steup"" is actually of no help at all,and trying to access setting on the extender is not at all intuitive or explained well. But, hey! I got it working anyway.

  I know. I know. I should have known better. It's so inexpensive. But my wifi works really well all over my house with the exception of the far corner of the den where I had (foolishly) moved my work desk. So, I thought a tiny boost to get it a few more feet wouldn't warrant an expensive fix. I was wrong. This product literally does nothing. Sure, all the devices can jump on it but that's where it ends. Doesn't work. Useless. And I'm so annoyed at myself for buying yet another piece of plastic, destined for the dump. Don't be like me. Spend a little money. Don't believe the effusive positive reviews. Don't flirt with the ""useless junk"" shame spiral. Help Mother Earth out. Get something that works and lasts.

    It works to boost download speed
  
",4.0 ,Amoy Y.,"Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have done multiple tests in terms of the download speed as the followings: 1. The signal or speed is approx 40% of the router if sitting beside.  2. Setting in the midway is not working or useless since router is even more powerful then the unit. 3. After I moved the unit as far as from router but as closer as to laptop (as long as the signal stays in blue rather than red), the extender increased speed from 10 MB (without unit) to 25 MB (with unit) in comparison to my router at 50 MB download speed. So I would say it worked out but depending on how you use it and how much you expected it.

  For testing purpose, I connected directly to the wifi signal and later connected through this range extender within close range to the wifi router and tested the download speeds both ways. When connected directly, I had around 50mbps and when connected through this device it was 10mbps. The box says up to 300mbps. So the one I got is not working up to mark. Returning the device.Also, the device only supports 2.4GHz networks only. If you have two bands like I do 2.4GHz and 5GHz, you can only extend the 2.4GHz one. The setup was very easy with their Tether app. It was cheap but does not meet my needs as it was throttling the download speeds.

  This only works on the 2.4 GHz band. When I installed this it uses the exact same SSID as my Verizon router's SSID. As a result, my network of Nest thermostats, cameras and smoke/ detectors became confused and would go offline periodically. My Netgear extender establishes SSIDs that are based on the Verizon router SSID with an extension added to the SSID so that when I scan my WiFi network I can distinguish among the various 2.4 and 5 GHz WiFi signals and set the Nest deices (or any other wireless device) to whatever signal I want.

  Tried the setup numerous times and could never get it to work as an extender to my wifi. I ended up having to set it up as an additional network which is a real pain. What ends up happening is my phone hops on this network which is only 2G and leaves my 5G network. Unfortunately, I have to manually go back to 5G when coming back to the other side of the house. It is much slower than my main connection. I wish it would just extend my network rather than being an additional one. Oh well, it was cheap and it does provide an extra signal in the back part of my house.

  This came as an add on to the MyQ WiFi garage door opener.  I wasn't even sure I would need it, but the price is right. I first tried linking this up to my WiFi system via the app, option #2 on the install list, and it didn't really want to link up properly.  Took it inside and just plugged it in by the router and did it that way.  Took a couple of tries anyway, but did finally get linked up.  When I moved it back out to the garage for the MyQ it took a couple of minutes to reconnect to the WiFi when plugged back in, but then it was linked up and running strong.  Seems to be adding a pretty good signal out in the garage so it's working good so far.  Only one day so I can't attest to the durability.

Doing zoom meetings, conferences etc. Mind you, he has an office area upstairs. I would not be able to get a glass of ice or try to start dinner etc, without getting (be quiet) looks! 😡.  So I asked one day why aren’t you upstairs?? He said he would loose WiFi sometimes and it would drop him out of meetings unexpectedly. So.... I had to do some researching in order to keep my sanity and save my marriage!  This device has been AMAZING!! My husband was very skeptical because it was only $20. But let me say, he is EXTREMELY HAPPY with it! He has been using it for a week now and has had NO issues at all! He has told all his coworkers and friends about this WiFi extender. Thank you thank you for such a great product at a very reasonable price!! 😄

Main router gives 100MBPS but the extender’s 5GHZ gives 4-5MBPS!2. The range extender doesn’t increase the range as expected. Devices 10 feet from the extender shows just one bar.Overall, I am not that happy with this device. May be I got a defective one, not sure. But point #1 is a big disappointment. I won’t be able to return due to lockdowns. But would not recommend this.

  I was being disappointed by sluggish respionsiveness of my Ring doorbell.  Though my router is on the same floor as the doorbell and perhaps 30 feet away, there are a number of intervening walls.  Per the Ring diagnostics, my RSSI value was -65 (a measure of received signal strenth: the less negative the better).  This isn't 'terrible' but I decided to take the chance on improving it by purchasing this unit for $19.99.  It was very simple to set up and I was able to plug it into an outlet about six feet from the doorbell (and separated only by a glass pane).  At first I saw no change at all.  But checking it today (several days after the installatiion) the RSSI is now -28, which is considerably better.  Most importantly, accessing the Ring doorbell via my iPhone app seems to be a LOT more responsive.  So, at this point I am very happy with this purchase (especially since the Ring WiFi extender is $49.99).

  I have to admit I bought this without really understanding how it works. I started using a back bedroom as my office but I’ve been disappointed with a very poor WiFi signal in that room. I bought this device to boost the signal but the only place to leave it plugged in is this back bedroom.The directions say to plug it in somewhere between the “dead zone” and the router.  But I had no place in between for permanent installation. I followed the directions for setting it up first by the router (easy!) and them temporarily halfway to my back bedroom. But, reasoning that the signal in my back bedroom is weak, but not dead, I decided to try the device in there.TaaDaa!!! It worked. I’ve now got a great signal for steaming in the back bedroom. Very happy. Set up was a breeze. I’m pleased with my purchase. I would buy another one if needed.

So prior to arrival I went on line and down loaded the instructions for set up and reviewed how to setup the product.  When the product arrived, I plugged it into a power source near my router, pushed the WSP button on the router and then on the product and waited about 10 seconds for both lights on the extender to turn solid blue.  Then I moved the product to the new location upstairs, plugged it into the wall socket, waited about 10 seconds and it was connected.  The TV, computers and music devises all showed significant improvement due to the enhanced WIFI reception.So after all that, I would highly recommend this product.  It works very well and the setup couldn't have been easier.

   Very happy with this product! I have a 3,000 sq ft home and our router is located near the middle of the house on the second floor. My office is at the far end of the house on the first floor and I was only getting about 2 bars of wifi signal. I needed a better connection for online virtual work meetings, and this extender boosted my wifi signal to full bars.Super easy to install. Plug it in, push the wps security button on the back of all wifi routers, push the button on the extender... and DONE!The extender creates a new network name to log into by using your existing network name and adding ""_EXT"" to it. Mine is ""Netgear28_EXT"" for example and it uses the same password as my main ""Netgear28"" signal.This isn't as nice as a mesh wifi network, where it automatically switches to the network in your house with the best signal, allowing you to roam without switching signals. I have to specifically log into the _EXT network when I go out to my office on the other end of the house.But for 20 bucks, this was an awesome solution! Mesh wifi is a couple hundred dollars and up.Does exactly what it says it will. I may eventually buy a second one, but upgrade to the dual band option. This one does not broadcast the faster 5ghz signal from my router, but 2.4ghz works fine for Zoom meetings. If you're into gaming, you may want the 5ghz signal.

  Even a top quality Wifi unit can use an assist...With the wifi router at on end of the house and our TV/ entertainment system at the other end - and on the lower floor...even with a Dir-TV hook-up the wifi connection appeared weak, slow (or was being ramped down by the provider?). I'd like to think that the house is well constructed and insulated. Leaves me to ask - why when the TV/ entertainment system & Dir-TV connection was 1st hooked up did the wifi channels load almost immediately but now...during the day, when every one in the neighborhood's at work - why are the wifi channels timing out before the show loads..? It wasn't too long before the same thing happened in the evening.It's frustrating. (Rhetorical questions.)Personally, I was always thinking of purchasing a wifi booster. Again, is there a wifi router package that manufactured that sales the main router with (multiple?) wifi boosters?So, to the review: The TP Link RE-200 had good reviews both on and off Amzn. The price listed on Amzn was better than what the local merchants are asking for the same unit.TP Link set-up was simple and it was easy to integrate the unit with our main wifi router. The TP Link can be relocated (to another electrical wall outlet) after initially set it up is completed. We chose to place the TP Link at the opposite end of the house from where the main wifi router is installed and on the same floor. (The TP Link is located approximately, directly above the TV/ entertainment system. After changing the wifi login settings on our TV/ entertainment system to connect to the TP Link - we were able to enjoy our 'non-cable' shows. The show loading speed is never immediate but is quicker than it has been. Although there is no need for another wifi-booster - we'd purchase this unit again for it's ease of setup and price.

  Once properly connected, this extender really did improve signals to parts of the house with weak Wifi. However, setup was not that easy. I am not a techie but have learned a lot since buying this device. First of all, it connected flawlessly per the instructions but in the process knocked out our ROKU Express thereby eliminating our video streaming capabilities of Netflix. Several resets of the device did nothing and TP Link Customer service was of no help, eager to deflect questions to their DIY tutorials rather than provide trouble shooting advice. If you have the patience to read their FAQs and other instruction material, you can get these devices working properly.Lessons learned- aged dual band routers at least mine can present connectivity issues for this extender to operate correctly. As in our case, conflict did occur and it take some fine tune adjustments on the extender settings to get the two bands correctly segregated and aligned to devices that use a 2.4Ghz signal versus 5.0 GHz signal. Once this is all figured out, the extender works great and really enhances the signal.The placement of the Ethernet jack on the unit could be better, as it is on the top of the unit, partially creating an obstruction limiting use of the second electrical receptacle. The Ethernet would be better served on the left or right side not on the top of the unit.All in all this is a good extender but its got its quirks but does work well once correctly setup.

  I'm always wary about 'wifi extenders', but I had an issue where I put in a new Netgear cable modem that sacrificed wifi for speed. See, the modem is in the garage, and a hardline runs through the house to the wifi router that serves the house. Well, the house except the garage....So I have the cable in the garage but no signal, and no option to hard-wire it without running 50 ft of ethernet cable, and figured I'd give this a try. It's just on the other side of the garage door, and the download speed is approx. 10x faster now, upload is 3-4x faster, according to various speed tests. A must-buy if you have out-of-range devices.Only potential drawback would be the re-named network, but honestly that's probably easier for devices to manage automatically now than it was even in recent memory.

  I purchased this extender some time ago.  I unpackaged it and follow the instructions carefully setting it up.  I am not a technology person, but thought it was working fine.  Not long ago I upgraded my AT&T WiF.  The technician from AT&T checked 'all' of my WiFi enabled devices and found that the extender was not working.  Later I went to the TP Link website and closely followed the instructions, however, while setting the extender up I could go only so far and it would not complete the set up.  I went to TP Link's online chat and informed the person the issue I was having.  I was asked for my phone number and was told tech support would be calling me in a few minutes.  After just a few minutes I received the call from TP Link's tech support.  Ultimately, he wanted to access my computer which I reluctantly agreed to knowing I had no important info. on 'this' computer. The technician explained everything he was doing as it was done which was essentially the same thing(s) I did from their web site.  After several attempts he told me I needed to have a different tech support person talk me through the set up, however, it was going to cost me $99.99 for a six month support policy.  I told him I was not interested in this policy and I took back control of my computer and I hung up.  I feel I should NOT have to pay for something to work after purchasing it.  Based on this I give it one star.  It is totally useless to me and to be told it was going to cost to set it up was ridiculous.  I might add that I have other TP Link products and have had no issues.

I thought this would be great.But a speedtest.net check with the same laptop in the same spot and switching between the original and original_EXT SSID dropped the internet speed from 30Mbps/30Mpbs to about 4Mbps/6Mbps.IMO this is maybe good for extending the range to get some barebones reception but at severe cost of throughput degradation.I guess it makes sense since it has to receive and repeat i.e. rebroadcast and this constant switching introduces significant enough latency to drop the speeds to useless speeds for things like video streaming or any real work. It's workable for emails/light browsing but otherwise practically useless.

  I wanted a WiFi extender that would give the family better access on our screened porch and around the yard. This device is adequate to the purpose, giving us three bars in those previously weak areas. This device is N rather than AC speed, like our main router. but for email, browsing, and most apps, it’s fine. Not for hi-def video streaming, however, but not a lot of that going on outdoors, so no biggie. I tried to set it up on a Mac, but was unsuccessful. I don’t think they tested it that well on MacOS, or the documentation wasn’t correct. Fortunately my wife has a Windows 10 laptop, and I was able to set it up as documented for Windows. For the price, this is a good, not great, product.

  I try to use wired whenever I can however my video doorbell is only wireless and happens to be outside in front of a brick wall, not the best for WiFi signal. The connection to the doorbell was spotty and would take forever to come up when the doorbell was rang (typically over a minute, sometimes even 2). I bought this hoping to fix that issue, I plugged it into the closest plug to my front door and connected it to my WiFi. I set this up by plugging my laptop into the ethernet port on it, you could also download their app but I didn't want another app on my phone. Setup was pretty straight forward and walked you through it. I changed some settings, mainly not having it change the SSID. By default it wants to add an _EXT to it's SSID, but I didn't want to have to go to my other devices and choose which ones to connect to this extender. By keeping the SSID and password the same my devices would just connect to the one that has the stronger signal, either my router or this extender. Once I got that all set up, I rebooted my doorbell and it automatically connected to the extender since it had a much stronger signal. I tested the doorbell and was able to get it to come up within about 10 to 20 seconds, significantly faster than before without this extender. So in the end this solved my slow issue and I can use my doorbell as it was intended. Another use for this would be if you have a device that is only wired you can plug that device into the ethernet port on this extender and have it connect to your WiFi that way. Either way you use it this thing is great.

  My workshop is a concrete building located about 40 feet behind our house. To see the WiFi it needed to be set by the window on an extension cable and gets a solid blue led for signal. Now my Duet WiFi controller for the 3d Printer and be ran from inside the house as well as the Octoprint for the other printer. Before that neither worked unless I moved them to the window. This allows me to run them from the other side of the workshop where they fit better.You can set up this device with the exact same SSID as your router so it will allow any device already recognized by your router to use it with no additional setup.

  Update, 12/30/2020:I get frequent drop offs  or other issues where it'll be like I have no internet even if the device is showing multiple bars of signal strength. Rebooting doesnt always help and is tedious.I was already unhappy with how much the device throttles down internet speed but this is a different issue. The device is barely useable now and I have gone back to connecting to my main wifi.This item easily bridged the gap and solved a problem I had in my home relative to my smart phone.My router is in the first floor north side of my home. Which means when I'm on the second floor south side of my home, I barely get a signal and forget about having a signal on the patio upstairs or downstairs.I plug the TP-Link upstairs and now I have at least 4 bars of signal everywhere.The one considerable downside is that data speed reduces quite a bit when using this. For my purposes, I don't need a lot but I know that my wifi speeds are a lot faster without the TP-link. For example on my 5G wifi network, I may get 81 mbps. On the TP-Link network, I get about 18 mpbs (which is about 2.5-3mbs per sec). That's quite a drop but still adequate for all of my uses. However, this item is supposed to be able to delivery up 300 mbps. So there's something wrong here.

Plug the device near your existing router, login to default (unprotected) wifi, connect to your home wifi and get ***_EXT network created, relocate the extender to another location.It is very nice to have signal strength indicator directly on the device - so you can try it in different locations around your house.

  I read the reviews, they were all over the place so I decided to try this item. I have been using my computer on my front porch and my router is at the back of my modest sized old home... I thought it would be a fast and stable connection, however there are many times that my skype/zoom/meet/gotowebinar, etc. loaded very slowly, buffered and I received messages saying my internet was unstable. maybe it's the thick plaster walls, but anyhow, I happened upon this product and even though there were mixed reviews, I bought it... I am moderately tech savvy, not an expert by any stretch of the imagination, but can follow directions and troubleshoot to a small degree. You don't need to be any kind of expert to set this up and get it going... You do need to be able to plug it in near your router, push a button on the router and then within two minutes push the only button on this device and look for blinking and then solid lights...  Before I ordered it, I did check my router to make sure it has a WPS button, because if it doesn't then you might have to do some of the fancy installation processes. If the router has this WPS button, you should be able to do the easy setup... plug in, push router button, push device button, wait for solid light, unplug, put in outlet halfway to dead zone, open computer and connect to your network _ext...My connection on my porch is solid now on two computers and my phone...Woo Hoo for under $20.00!!!

  I decided it might be nice to get a WiFi Extender for our house to improve the WiFi signal upstairs, with the whole family working and doing school from home right now due to the Covid 19 lockdown.  This one had good reviews and was pretty inexpensive so I decided to try it.  Set up was ridiculously easy and literally took about 2 minutes.  Unboxed it, plugged it in near my xfinity router and hit the power button.  Waited a few seconds until power light stopped blinking, then hit the WPS button on my router.  Pushed the WPS button for a second or two on the extender and waited a few seconds for the light to stop blinking and turn solid.  Took it upstairs and plugged it in and checked on my laptop for my network name with the _ext next to it.  Connected to the _ext network.  Typed in my password (same as my regular network) and done.  It just took longer to type that than it did to completely set up this extender!  Incredibly simple and painless.Works like a charm and definitely extended the range of my WiFi signal.  I get a much stronger signal up on our third floor now (router is in the basement family room).  I walked around and compared the signal from my regular network to the _ext network and found I could connect to the _ext network outdoors in the yard and in places where I couldn't get a signal from my regular network.The only reason I give this 4 stars vs. 5 is that I ran a bunch of speed tests comparing the regular network from my router to the _ext network from the extender.  My tests showed download and upload speeds were only about 1/2 as fast from the extended network connection as they were from the regular network connection.  I found this to consistently be the case in various rooms around my house where I could get signals from both the router and the extender.  For example:  My download speed from my wired connection to the router in my home office downstairs averages about 370 Mbps.  Using Wifi on the main floor on my laptop it's about 35 - 50 Mbps on average from the regular network.  Using the _ext network connection from the extender on my laptop in the same location it's about 16 - 20 Mbps.  That said, I did get a signal from the extender and speed of at least 12 Mbps in places where I could not get any signal at all from my router alone.Conclusion - the extender provides greater range, but slower download / upload speeds than my router alone (but still adequate speed for my needs).  Since what I was looking for was greater range for my network, I am quite satisfied with this purchase and it was well worth the $20 I paid.  I definitely recommend it.I did not rate Tech Support for this product since it was so easy to use that I had no need for Tech Support.

  this extender solved my problem with no signals in certain parts of my house. I have a 2 story with at least 12 different devices that use WiFi. It was getting to a point where I could not use certain devices because of poor signal. I wasn’t sure if I needed an extender or a booster.This device was not too expensive so I thought I’d give it a shot. It’s easy to setup and I plugged it in upstairs. It creates an extension of your current WiFi connection and I was able to connect my upstairs devices to it. Have had it for a month now and no issues or dropped Skype calls. I work from home full time and constantly had issues with my skype conference calls. None since I got this extender.

  I purchased this product because my wi-fi signal to my Ring Pro Doorbell was not strong enough and I felt that my Received Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) was not up to par on my standards. This extender was easy to set up, especially if you get their app called Tether. From there you can set it up on your network and manage what devices you want to keep that were previously were connected. Before purchasing this, my RSSI level to my Ring Pro doorbell was around 68-74, which is fairly high. After installing this, my RSSI dropped and hovers to around 42-48, which is significantly lower.What I will say is that positioning matters! I tried it in almost all the outlets I thought would be beneficial and was able to find one place to keep a consistent lower RSSI level. And they do instruct that you want to place the extender half way to where your dead zone area is. Great product.

Unfortunately it's signal isn't always the greatest and a lot of my electronics were connecting to it and had very poor signal. So, I renamed it as ""ext"" and only have my cameras linked to it.It does what I needed it to do and it was a great price.All in all, if you need an extender - I'd totally suggest this one!

  I have a network extender (netgear) in the rear of the property that works beautifully for that quadrant, but I needed something for the front by the garage, so I order this. I finally got around to installing it while I was cleaning (it was with my “get-to” projects). After I wrapped for the night, I turned on my ps4 and had no internet connection (hard wired lan). I noticed my wifi had no internet also. My main network (2.4ghz) was gone from the wifi list and only the 5g and other network extender and this device were showing up, but nothing had internet. I restarted the network and still nothing. I unplugged this device, since it was the only thing that was new to my network setup and my internet connectivity came back along with my main 2.4. It’s sad to say, but this device “somehow” took out my internet. I don’t want to install it again to try to disprove my theory. I’ll just stick with devices I trust from now on.

TP-Link AC750 Dual Band WiFi Range Extender, Extends WiFi to Smart Home & Alexa Devices (RE200)









  
  
    
  Product works great on extending both 2.4G and 5G HZ wifi, once being setup.The way to setup 2.4Ghz wifi was relatively straightforward, especially through ""WPS"" -- by pushing the 'WPS' button on the extender first, and then pushing the 'WPS' button on the router within 2 minutes --, which unfortunately did not work for 5G hz in my case.My problem was, the extender was not able to detect 5Ghz wifi signal, being broadcasted from my Verizon FiOS router, and being picked up by other devices, such as laptop, iPhone and iPad, without problem. No luck with the manual setup process through ""wifi setup page"" on the web UI either -- the 5G hz SSID was not listed on the ""wireless settings"" tab.After spending some time on Google, searching through 5G wifi signal specs, I finally found out the root cause -- the incompatible signal channel.The channel setting on the FiOS router was ""Automatic"", and the actual channel being used was in fact one of the ""DFS"" channels, no problem for cell phones and laptops, but obviously not being recognized by the extender. So, I changed the channel number to ""48"" and after the router rebooted, the extender was able to pickup the 5Ghz signal easily. I suppose, other lower channels, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44 and 46, should also work, but I did not try.I hope this trick would be helpful to other users with similar problem.

Well, forget that it keep blinking and then no light. Ok, went to step 2, tether. Now I'm worried, WTF, tether. Go through all the steps and no go. That's it I'm done.

  Waited for a month before reviewing this product to give it a fair test. Router is on the first floor and upstairs TV Roku wasn't getting enough wifi signal to keep up. The setup for this product is extremely simple using the WPS button - just push two buttons and it is working. There is an iPhone app TP-Link Tether you can use to monitor the device. You probably want to change it's name as it sets itself to the same name and password as the router, so if your router network is called Mary you might want to name this MaryExtender1. Then go to your device and have it connect to MaryExtender1.In my case it improved the signal to the Roku from 3/5 bars to 4/5 bars. This was enough for it to operate properly in high definition and without pausing to download. So it is fair to say it works. On the other hand, wifi networks and devices do not seem to be robust and the network capability will degrade from time to time for unknown reasons. In that case restarting the router and this device seems to help sometimes.  Other times who knows. This extender is very simple and inexpensive and it works.  It is worth a try. However, it may not permanently ""fix"" the problems with your wifi...and maybe no extender can.

    N300 Did the Trick Wonderfully
  
",5.0 ,Scott Rauch,"Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  N300 did exactly what I hoped it would do!Our wireless router is on one side of our 40-foot long three-story house, with my computer (upon which I am writing this-here review) on the opposite side of the house on the third floor (so, as far as you can get from the router, and still be in the house). I had irritatingly slow internet access, and FREQUENT dropped connections.I installed the WiFi extender on the same floor as the router, but on the opposite side of the house (40 feet away from the router) in direct line-of-sight of the router, under a buffet. So, if it had eyes, the extender could literally see the router. All the extender had to do was send its signal straight up about 16 feet, through two floors.That did the trick, and now I get fast internet with no drop-outs. It's great!

  So, I have been having issues with my internet for a while now. My computer couldn't seem to remain connected to the internet for anything more than 10 to 20 seconds. As anyone who is a university student knows, accessing the Googlesphere is incredibly important in order to provide quality analysis. So having a computer who couldn't stay connected to the interwebz was causing me no end of frustration. Naturally, my first call is to my ISP as they provided the router in 2014 (I KNOW!!!! The ancient thing was BEGGING for a retirement!). They came and replaced the router this past Thursday but the problem only became worse! And there was a quiz! Thankfully I aced the quiz and ordered the range extender first thing this morning. The setup was very easy if you know how to do technology stuff. The unit itself is nice and small with NO WIRES! Due to it's size, I am easily able to hide it behind a storage rack and still have the quality signal I expect from my internet.

  I bought this due to the weak signal I was getting in my living room. The router is in the closet of my master bedroom which is about 50’ from the living room. I was getting very weak signal on my Roku which made steaming terrible. The signal would be so weak that When I watched basketball games it would be blurry and freeze on me. This solved that issue! The Roku device would show weak signal and now it show excellent signal. Basketball games are so much clearer now. The I just installed the TP-Link N300 and it took about 5 mins total. First you plug the WiFi extender to a receptacle near the router. Then you press the WPS button on the router and press the WPS button on the WiFi extender and wait till the blue light stops blinking and stays solid blue. Relocate the WiFi extender between the router and dead zone area, wait till the blue light stays solid blue. Now you look for the WiFi network which is the same name as your existing WiFi but with _EXT. It uses the same password. I would recommend buying this if you are having weak wifi signal around the house.

  In the hopes that I could get my crappy internet to be more steady in the back of my apartment, this works well enough for that purpose. I think. When we first plugged it in, it made everything go super fast. Later in the day, we suffered from a snow storm which always seems to muck things up. Yesterday was no different. I've not noticed any difference today, but there's a foot of snow on the ground and much on the wires as well. I didn't lose signal on my smart tv last night, but I did have to disconnect my phone from the wifi in the house as it was NOT moving well when connected to the extension. We will see if it gets better when the snow is melting.

  I don't often give reviews, but his little thing is amazing.  I have a WiFi security camera mounted on an outbuilding that barely worked due to the weak signal at it's location.  I would get an updated view every 5 to 10 seconds and trying to pan or tilt was painful, to say the least.  I didn't have a ""halfway"" location to install this at as recommended,  so I put it up in the same outbuilding as the camera and hoped for the best.  The result is that the distant camera now performs as well as the camera on the other side of the wall from my WiFi router and the camera settings page shows a full strength signal rather than the one bar it showed before.  Setup was very easy even though I needed to use the Web Browser method shown in the instructions because my WiFi access point does not have a WPS button, but it worked first try.  Very happy with this device.  One caveat to mention though, is to make sure you differentiate the signal from this device with a unique name such as adding -ext to your wireless SSID name.  I didn't the first time and just named it the same as my wireless network.  When I went to connect the camera I couldn't tell which access point I was connecting to, as the both had the same name.  ( Did this in the house so the signals were both strong).  I went back and added -ext to the name and it became obvious which was which.  I now have glitch free streaming of the video to my monitor and the pan and tilt functions are instantaneous.  Highly recommended.

  My router is upstairs and there has always been a major drop-off or even a complete loss of Wi-Fi signal down stairs and out on the back patio, so I theorized that placing one of these extenders down stairs in the living room and just inside the patio door might help with that. Well while it isn't effective in boosting the signal in the house (actually weaker) it is apparently helping out on the patio which is what it is intended for, so this device seems to be doing what I bought it to do.With several speed tests going back and forth with this and my regular Wi-Fi network I can see a consistent 5-10 mbps increase using the extender and while that's not blowing my socks off at least I don't loose signal completely and that a nice improvement.

  UPDATE |  OCT 2020The signal has improved over time. It is much faster and steady now. Sometimes it still falls and becomes slow, but most of the time the signal is pretty good and around the same speed of the original router. I.did nothing to change this it must have been an upgradenor something. At first I almost threw it in the garbage but let connected in th living room for the use of the guests and weeks later it all seems to improve. Now, most of the time, it is working really well.Changed the rating to 4 stars.Original review:Way too slowwwwItem came in pristine conditions, very easy to install and manage, but the signal is way too slow. From around 20mbps that gives me the router, the repeater only gives me max 1.5mbps, that's the best I could get out of it.Read through the HELP section on the original TP Link website, but nothing worked.Now I have internet in some parts of my house that were completly 'dark', but the speeds sometimes becomes pretty unusable. Can only hope for a future upgrade that could solve this issue. I could understand that the signal wouldn't be as strong as the original, even half of it or less, but less than 10%....it doesn't makes any sense. By the moment it is only there conected sucking electricity.I bought this to give signal to a couple of IoT cameras that I have installed were the original internet signal did not have any reach, but it is almost pointless. The signal is strong, but has no quality at all.

  Consider me ""mind blown"".  I setup the range extender in my house on the 2nd level to support my sons PC, he was having lag issues on minecraft.  I wasn't expecting to much from this item, just hoping to boost the signal in the 1500 square foot house from the main floor to the second floor.  To my surprise not only did the TP-Link boost the signal to the 2nd floor as desired but it also increased my signal strength in the basement on my primary PC.  Now, when I say increased I mean INCREASED!!!!, talking going from 3mbs to 44mbs (download speeds).  This was a huge surprise to me and I am ecstatic about this product.  I would recommend this item to anyone who has a weak signal from their primary router.  Never thought I would get more from a range extender then I do my wireless router.  Great product.

  Horrible!!!!!!! Don’t buy it... I mean it’s cheap and works, sometimes... it’s constantly losing signal from the main router... also this is supposed to be a “range extender” maybe for like 20 feet... I’ve moved this around and it still doesn’t pick up the signal very well... I constantly have to unplug it and plug it back up just to get it to sync... the app that it has works well... tech support is horrible as well.. and I’m very tech savvy... I guess that’s why it’s so cheap... if you need it to go through a wall or something it works but you’ll have issues... just not worth the money even though it’s cheap or the effort... find another product so you won’t be constantly messing with this thing.. I want to set it and forget it except when I need to fix something or the power goes out or something like thy but nope... literally EVERYDAY reboot... in me picture the thing is les then 20 feet away from the main router that reaches hundred of yards... this thing still has a weak signal... my phone and all my other devices picks up the signal when this thing won’t... and no mines not defective it’s just cheap and doesn’t work well at all...

  I can't give 5 stars because I ran into some weird issues with my Xfinity XB6 and XFi pod mesh setup.  I have some cameras that need a dedicated 2.4 signal as they were getting ""confused"" with the dual band 2.4/5 of the mesh network.Support was fantastic and after I contacted them they emailed me regularly with suggestions and to see where I was at.  You can't beat that.  They wanted to get things working.There is a firmware update to allow you to control the DHCP service ""better"".The device would connect to my network, but nothing connected to them could get out to the internet.For some reason it was acting as a DHCP sever even though it was off.  Even with the firmware update still could not get things working.  I would suggest you update the firmware before you add any devices and redo the setup.I tried two units thinking maybe the first was wonky (it can happen), but ran into weirder issues when I attempted the second one.  It caused the Xfinity router to freak out.  It stopped issues IPV4 addresses to my devices.  Wired devices could no longer connect unless I manually configured the network settings on the wired adapters.  Wifi was on getting ipv6 address and not all of my 2.4 devices liked that.I had to do a hard reset of my router and after that I was able to get my network back up with all my devices.Also I was able to get my picky cameras online.So I no longer need these and returned them.  I thanked support (email).If I have any future needs for network devices (switches mostly) I am going to go through them.  I have flipped between Netgear and DLink for my devices over the years.  And when I have to reach out to support then, they were sort of a pain.  They may be better now, but I am goin with TP-Link because of how receptive their were to help with what is an older device (of sorts).  Thank you TP-Link!

  This extender drops WiFi non stop. It rarely connects and has weak signal. The install was not fast or easy and you will need an app to run these. The app also didn’t work well. It wouldn’t load the extenders and did not give accurate readings of their signals. We ended up buying 3 to help with signal in our single story home and returned one but we’re stuck with the others as we passed return date. Went with a different brand WiFi extender for the same price and what an amazing difference. I couldn’t recommend this extender as it did not do what it was intended for, which was to extend the WiFi and stay connected. Pay a couple bucks more or go with a different brand if you need a reliable WiFi extender.

  [EDITED 9-7-2017]I've played with more settings. For those interested in technical details, I realized the DHCP Server settings defaults to 1 minute leases for connected devices. I think this was causing problems for my devices and reconfigured it manually (had to enter Gateway and DNS settings) to give out leases for 2880 minutes, which was the maximum time limit allowed.It is working as expected now, providing connection speeds of 1MB/sec, half of my true internet speed at the router. For this small success I upgrade my rating to 3 stars, but it has still been a long and arduous journey to get this thing working![ORIGINAL REVIEW]I've been using the product for about a year now, and it has consistently underperformed. Setup went well, I just followed the instructions and used suggested settings. I have about 2 MB/s download speeds from my ISP that comes through my router, the TP-Link has a good connection displaying a green light, multiple different devices connect (desktop, laptop, smartphone) and all have strong strength signal, yet ALL devices are experiencing slow speeds as bad as 1 KB/s per second... I have tried rebooting the extender, resetting its settings, repositioning its antenna, reducing the number of connected devices, updating firmware, changing IP settings to be statically set for my router, and moving the router so that it is closer to the extender.This TP-Link extender *always* underperforms and often provides a 2,000x slower connection than my true internet speeds :(I give it >1 star for technically doing what it is supposed to, it does extend the network, it just does a very bad job of it.

",3.0 ,Ross Gates,"Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2018","









  
  
    
  I purchased to use as a Wireless Access Point (meaning the RE200 is connected to my Internet Router via ethernet cable).  Once it was properly configured (much trial & error), it works great for this purpose; and I am not restricted to using it only at my house ... can be plugged into a router anywhere you need it.  I am only rating 3 stars because the instructions for Access Point setup urgently need improvement; and I found their documentation to be misleading ... the manufacturer needs to rewrite the instructions (I build robots for a living ... but could not figure it out).For use as an Access Point, the following setup steps are what finally worked for me based on advice from the 3rd Techical Support person I spoke to on the telephone:1) Plug the RE200 into AC receptacle; and then plug an ethernet cable from a laptop computer (not your router) to the ethernet port on the RE200.2) Once this is done, open a tab on your browser and go to 192.168.0.254.  This will open their setup webpage.3) The first thing to do at this point is create an administrator password, hit enter, and then immediately click on the mode button in the upper right corner and select Access Point ... this will reboot the RE200 and open the correct configuration steps on their webpage for setting up passwords and other parameters pertaining to this application of the product.4) Once you are finished with the online set up, you will save and click finish (wait for the changes to load and reach 100%).  Now the the RE200 is ready to plug into your router and use as a wired Access Point.5) If you need to go back and change passwords, simply plug the RE200 into your laptop as described above.  When finished, save settings and plug the RE200 back into your router.There has been much controversy and disagreement among buyers of this item about whether or not it can work as an Access Point ... I assure it can ... but it took 3 calls to their Technical Support and much wasted time to accomplish.  Sad ... that a good product with excellent packaging and great warranty does not have better instructions. I hope you find this review helpful; however, please understand that I do not work for TP-Link and do not consider myself part of their Technical Support Team ... I am simply trying to provide some useful advice to other consumers.  If my advice does not work for you, call their technical support Toll Free:1-866-225-8139

  I have Ethernet run throughout my house, and frankly I hate using wifi due to EMI considerations mostly, so the majority of my internet devices are all hardwired to my home network. However, I still need wireless access for portable devices like phones and tablets. This device fits the bill for an access point perfectly. My only complaint is that the Ethernet port is only 100Mbps rather than Gigabit, but as my WAN connections is only 50Mbps I can live with it. This device replaced a defunct 1st generation Apple Airport express, and I have to admit it works much better with a significantly stronger signal than the AE. Using a wifi analyzer standing about 10' away from each device, I found the TP-Link N300 has about 10dB greater signal strength than the Apple AE. For $18 I am completely satisfied with this product.

After purchasing the mesh internet system I have now the extender no longer disconnects from the internet but is still useless because my mesh system reaches further than it does. Basically what I’m saying is don’t waste your money on this WiFi extender or any WiFi extender and buy a mesh internet system which will save you the time and frustration.Update 07/13/2020As of now the extender is useless they have taken away the ability to use it on their app. Shows up as an unsupported device and will not connect to the internet.

  Useless. We bought this because wifi speed is 150Mbps in the router room, but drops to 15 one room over (11 feet away) and by the living room (20 ft away) it’s down to 1.5. Comcast couldn’t diagnose anything remotely (all looked fine) and can’t send a tech right now so figured I’d try an extender.This just makes it worse. Bedroom drops to 5 instead of 15, and living room goes down to a pathetic 200Kbps. Multiple tests yield the same result.We also can’t get it to connect to our 5G network, which is more powerful but even more affected by walls. It just doesn’t show up at all. Other reviews made it seem like 5G would work but it doesn’t.Sending it back.

  45 WiFi devices are connected in a 2100sf 2story home through TP-Link CR1900 cablemodem/router. Sporadic connections to some of the devices forced me to investigate WiFi extenders and mesh systems. I started with 2 Tp-Link RE200 extenders. They helped but not enough. Added a TP-Link RE450 which i centrally located on lower floor directly below the modem/router. This was a MAJOR improvement but still had some weak/dead spots in the house. Thus, I just added a 3rd RE200 lower floor far corner which seems to have solved the issue.My ISP is Cox Cable delivering 120Mbps. Using 3 of the RE200 units to extend WiFi and connect to 3 Android TV Boxes using Ethernet cables, Speedtest app says I am getting from 46 to 74Mbps at the 3 RE200s which is more than enough to deliver HD TV shows via CBS All Access app without ANY buffering.MESH SYSTEMS. Prior to relying on the TP-Link extenders, I tried Linksys Velop and Tenda 3 piece units. Neither of them ever delivered more than 25Mbps via WiFi or using their Ethernet connections so both those systems were returned for refunds. Unless something changes negatively, I'm sticking with TP-Link Extenders (which cost about 1/3 the total price of Linksys and are 100% easier to install (simply plug & play).12/24/2018 UPDATE: The 3rd RE200 I added says V2.1 on back. My existing 2 RE200's say V1.0 on back. Since receiving the 3rd TP-Link RE200 I noticed erratic behavior. It would go from having the strongest Ethernet signal to having ZERO signal, despite showing the same green lights on the front. Thus, I am returning the defective VersIon 2.1 device. BOTTOM LINE: I've yet to discover any factory in any industry with 100% Quality Control and my other 2 TP-Link extenders have been totally reliable so I've only removed 1 star for this defective device encounter.

  Does exactly what it says and after 1 day it does it well.  I've extended my WiFi signal (ATT 2Wire modem/router) to my entire basement with this device.  Currently my ATT router is single band so that's all I really get to use now but will be adding a dual band router soon.My signal is very strong in the house and I've very pleased with the device overall.Setup though was not simple for my experience using the web browser.  Following the directions I was easily able to connect to either the _2.4Ghz or _5Ghz signal after plugging it in.  But the internal setup page was an awful experience.  Took many refreshes to get to the first page and start the process.  It first let me get up to the 5Ghz scan and then stopped responding.  Multiple refreshes were needed to start over.  I spent a good 20 stubborn minutes refreshing and getting to various states of the setup process.  Used 2 different laptops during this process trying to get the webpage setup to work.  Finally gave up and used the WPS button and it setup the device within a minute (after I turned WPS on in the modem/router setups .. ATT defaults it to off).  So I'd recommend going WPS based on my experience.  I am not a novice at all (PC & technical support for 20+ years) so I could see how worse this would be to someone with little to no PC knowledge.  May have just been bad luck with my specific device since I see others had no problem with the web page setup at all.I would still highly recommend this device for someone needing to extend their WiFi coverage.

  This thing took almost an hour to set up. I used all three methods of trying to connect it, and none of them were working for various reasons. It would appear to be connected, but that little blue light...that [CENSORED] little blue light... just would not come on and stay on, because it wasn't actually connected. One method just wouldn't work. Another claimed I was using the wrong password. The third just gave me the middle finger or something. I was JUST about to throw it all back in the box and give up when the blue light (grrrrrrrrrrrrr) finally blinked once, twice, thrice...no...no...it stayed on that last time. I tried connecting my laptop. Success! And it has been working ever since. So now I can watch...cat videos...in my bedroom any time I want without all the buffering and interruptions. Best of all, I don't have to storm into my internet provider's office and raise holy heck because their signal is so weak. I just hope this thing never goes down, because I don't know if I have the patience to go thru all that again.

It struggled to get reception and on some devices couldn't. But then I had the brilliant idea of finding a name product I have had good experience with and a price-range so it was worth the try. Bottom line is I'm extremely happy with what I got. As long as you are not going thru block walls.. My guess is that might limit the signal. Otherwise it's wonderful and does the range it states.

  Great price. Install was super easy. Pressed the WPS button on main router and on this and I was done.The issue is speed reduction. The speed on my main router on download is 220mps.  The speed coming out of the extender is 20mps right next it. That is one tenth the speed.Further away, the speed at the spot i needed coverage on is 5mps. The coverage is good, it has full bars but much lower speed. Now, for me this is still ok for what i need, but keep in mind if you need lots of bandwith.Usually extenders will reduce speed by about half but one tenth is really slow imo.

I like that when plugged into an outlet, the second receptacle is still usable. Setup took about 10 minutes with the easy to follow instructions in the box. Once that I was done I switched my TV and ROKU to use the SSID of the extender.  My ROKU used to detect my signal strength as Fair and now shows it's as Excellent.

  The ""plug and play"" instructions will not work if you have an XFinity router model XB6-T (current/new router as of 2020). It initially appeared to set up and connect, but we still had our dead-zone issue. I called XFinity customer service and explained the situation that we purchased the TP-Link WiFi Extender and we were not able to ""extend"" the WiFi to our dead zone. I also explained that the TP-Link states that this Extender is comparable with ANY WiFI router. After going through all of the set-up instructions with XFinity, she came back and stated that this extender will not work with our router and we needed to purchase their xFi pod extender via their website which is $119 for 1 pod... wow. I am not into proprietary devices and did not accept this answer and decided to contact TP-Link for support. They were SO helpful and although it was a little more complex than ""plug and play"" they were able to walk me through setting up the extender and we now have WiFi access in our dead zone - saving me $100 in not having to buy XFinity's little money-making pod!

  I really like this wifi extender for the fact that it is EXTREMELY simple to install (took me less than a minute). You literally plug it in next to your router, press the WPS button on the router, and then the WPS button on the device, and wait for the signal light to light up (which took mere seconds). You can then unplug it and move it around to various outlets to try and get the best signal for the device you want to use it on. It even has an indicator light that will come on if it's plugged in too far from the router to get a signal.That being said, I was using this hoping to get more than one bar of signal in my basement bedroom, and now I sometimes will get a whole 2 bars, but that's it. I don't blame this on the device, however. I think concrete walls definitely don't help in letting the signal travel far, no matter how expensive of an extender I get. I would recommend this extender, just not for basements with concrete walls. It just isn't very effective.So, in summary:Pros:-EXTREMELY easy to set up and figure out how to use- seems very durable and high quality for the priceCons:- doesn't work well in basements with concrete walls (which is somewhat to be expected)

  I'm very pleased with the TP-Link N300 unit. The installation is very simple - just plug it in, press the WPS button on your router and then also the one on the top of the unit. After a minute or two, the signal light will stop blinking and become solid. The one that I have has two blue lights rather than green as earlier models, but it works the same. My laptop computer is used in a room that is over 100 feet and three walls away from the router. The unit is mounted on an electrical outlet in a stairway near the room where the computer sits. Whereas formerly I was getting less than 15 mbps, now I'm seeing 72 mbps and the signal is very stable. Considering the modest price, it has fixed a problem that was very annoying to me for a long time. What's not to like? I recommend this unit.

  I needed some coverage in my basement office for a printer that was regularly losing connection from the router in my living room.  I have a fios quantum router but wifi signals don't go thru steel and concrete well if at all.  I tried to use the wps feature but to be honest the pc way is just as easy and allows you to set it up right in front of you.  This one for the $$ seems to be just fine and it copies your ssid name so you don't have to change networks like other extenders.  You will have to assign a diff name to a second one if you want more than one of these otherwise the new one could search for the extender rather than the modem.  The ethernet port on the bottom is a nice feature as well.  It also has power management features if you choose to have it cycle down when not in use but I have it for my printer so I just leave it on all the time.  Seems great for the price I paid. And I like the internal antenna too, it looks much cleaner.

  Bought it (TP-LInk AC750/RE200) last year based on high ratings on Amazon. 3 years warranty offered was a plus.My home network works great powered by a triband Linksys router. All bands works fine and very stable. To cover some dead spots in the house, got this. Installation was easy and soon I had extended network on 2.4 and 5 GHz bands. First few days, worked great. Signal strength increased and I got good speed in previous dead spots. Then started having intermittent connection issues on 5 GHz band. Signal strength would be great, but would get ""Connected, no internet"" error. Checking the device, IP was not allocated. Unplug/replug would restore service. Contacted technical support. They couldn't find much. Since issue was really intermittent, I didn't pursue further.Few months later, it has become unstable on all bands. I have to constantly unplug/replug to get service. Sometimes when devices are connected, it would drop signal for few minutes on all bands and then reconnect automatically. Other times, it would display ""Connected, no internet"" error on devices. Did some troubleshooting. The ""system logs"" don't tell much. Figuring the extender is having issues in DHCP interaction with router, I gave static IP address to TP-Link extender. That didn't help. Slowly, I started give static IP addresses to my devices as well. That didn't help either.Contacted the technical support. Its overseas. The 24 hours live agent chat  doesn't work. It says, I am first one in queue but no one responds. Emails take a day process due to time difference. The first level of support gave me a new firmware to try. It didn't help. Then I was sent to advanced technical engineer. He gave me the same firmware to try. I flagged that to support and since then they have gone AWOL. Multiple follow-up emails have been unresponsive.With work from home in place, a stable network is critical. Have been many instances in the middle of meetings my connection would drop. Would waste minutes and rejoining the meeting after rebooting TP-Link extender.Unfortunately, the return period is over otherwise would have sent back.Cutting my losses and throwing this in trash. Will either get a new extender or go for mesh network.

  This item is marketed as a ""Range Extender"". However, as a ""Range Extender"" being a single band and all, this never fulfilled my requirements in terms of bandwidth delivered to a number of clients (also it was inconsistent). One of the other option I tried was as a wireless bridge, and it performed inconsistently as a bridge to support a 5-port 10/100 Ethernet switch. However, most recently I've deployed this as an AP, and it has been great! I've hooked it up to a powerline adapter TP-Link's own TL-PA8010p, and with the about 100Mbps that adapter is able to deliver, this so called ""Range Extender"" in AP mode, delivers the full N300 bandwidth that it's capable of, with great range, serving about 10 clients.

  I'll preface this by explaining the layout of my house. We recently bought a 2000sqft ranch with finished basement. The front of the house is the living room and kitchen. The back half of the house is our kids bedrooms. And our master was an addition to the back of the house, thru the smaller bedroom. This is where we keep our modem and router since our game systems and desktop are hardwired. One of our kids bedrooms is in the finished basement, that runs under the living room and kitchen and also has cinder block on either side. Bcuz of this, the living room, kitchen, and basement bedroom have TERRIBLE wifi connection. I couldn't even use my Google home in the kitchen bcuz it couldn't find our wifi. For a few months we've just been dealing with it, but now that my kids are all on virtual learning its just not cutting it. So we got this wifi extender. I set it up using the directions and recommended app. Then relocated to the livingroom, on the wall between it and the kitchen. And immediately we had full connection in the living room, kitchen, AND basement!! 4 bars in all rooms. It was only $20, so I didn't have high hopes. But I seriously can't believe its such a great signal at such an affordable price. Very very pleased.

  I have had problems with this extender from the beginning. I wish I would have returned it right away, but ended up not really needing it until after Amazon's return date.When I started using it I had problems, so I contacted customer support. I was on a chat with their tech support (India accent?) and allowed them to access my computer remotely. I got a sales pitch about how much unauthorized activity was on my Wi-Fi, and they could clean up my computer for $119.99. I said all I want was my Wi-Fi extender to work, when she said yes it will work but your Wi Fi overall will also work much better. He said it would take about an hour, I would not have to pay if I did not want to, but they would assure me that everything would work fine. After 40 minutes I got a phone call from someone else who was the ""technician who has been working on my computer"" (Hispanic accent) and paying $120 for services was no longer an option. He pretty well demanded payment, so I used my PayPal account. He wanted me to use a charge card and give him a charge card number. I wouldn't do it. That did not make him happy either. ThenThen he requested that I login to my email and when I did he typed a email ""from me"" to ""support@globalcaresolutions""  to authorize payment to ""which Macro Web Solutions"" of 128.70.  I would not allow the email to go through. I ended up with a charge on my account to a company called ""FastSpring""  The whole thing was very sketchy.I contacted the head of cyber security at my place of employment and found that what they were recommending was not necessary, and if I wanted to deny access to my Wi-Fi / extender, all I had to do was change my password. Any ""unauthorized activity"" listed was probably guests of our kids using the Wi-fi. I bought into their scare tactics.The Wi-Fi extender worked for a little over a week, now it shuts down randomly. I unplug it and plug it back in and it will work for about 20 hours and then quit again. I tried going back through customer support online chat and they said they do not accept returns or refunds.Stay away from this company.

  If you are at all tech-savvy, this is super easy to set up. The WPS button on your router allows for instant set-up.It's a cute little device.The internet speed isn't as fast as the main router, but it's fine for office use. Video games or multiple video streams might be a problem. This device will not speed up your existing network. I haven't noticed any latency issues with video calls.Note: this ""extends"" your existing wi-fi network by creating another local network with a different name (name of your wifi network plus ""-EXT""). So you have to set your devices to use the new wifi network in the spaces served by the extender. It's not a deal-breaker for me, but I had thought this would just ""boost"" my existing wi-fi network.This works great for a home office where you are working throughout the day on wifi, as your device will continue to use the extended network throughout the day. It wouldn't work as well if you roam throughout the house all day, as you would frequently need to adjust which wifi network your device is on.

  Once you get the range extender up and running it does as expected. The biggest gotcha with setting up this device is the firmware. On my device it was many months out of date. This caused me to have major problems attaching the unit to my network so it could be extended. I tried all three recommendations for setup with the old firmware and was not able to get the unit to get out to the internet, a common issue reported on these units. When I updated the firmware I was able to use the tether app to get the unit on my network and get out to the internet. The url based gui and the options with in are sparse but adequate for many folks.  Also if your looking to extend  5 GHz this is not the device for you.

Our internet provider said we’d have to upgrade $20/mo for the “premium” plan which allows for more devices on 5G. Instead we bought this! Installation was easy to follow. We placed it in the hallway upstairs (router is downstairs) and it works wonders. Super fast streaming on all devices and works well with multiple devices. Save the headache and order one of these!

  I have one corner of my house where the WiFi signal drops a little - in my boys room. They do Xbox gaming, watching videos, etc so I just wanted to extend the signal so it wouldn’t drop out. I was able to set up the tplink extender in a matter of minutes, but the issue arose when I started testing the speed. Near my original router, I get speeds of 300mbps+, and speeds range from 160 to 200ish back in my boys’ room. When using the tplink extender, speeds never passed 16mbps - no matter how close I was to the router (the box says 300mbps Wi-Fi). I’d be happy with even half the WiFi speed if the signal was going to be constant, but getting 1/10th the speed is not acceptable.

What's the speed result

From Main router

And from extender.
2020-05-30 21:41:16

I am getting a speed of 15mbps from the router and only 10mbps or lower from the extender. However I am getting full bars from the extender and single bars from the router
2020-05-30 21:42:38

That's correct

The extender seems to decrease the signal while increasing the bars displayed

Because our extender can't boost the speed

Only the signals

That's correct because when you move the extender to another location the speed will deducted due to "" Wireless Interferance ""
2020-05-30 21:45:25

I am in a remote corner of the house. Why should the signal from the extender be lower than the signal originating from the router? I bought the device because the signal in this area is insufficient

What exactly do you mean when you say ""signal""

How far are they connected from each other?
2020-05-30 21:47:39

Router is downstairs (20ft) from the extender...device is another 20 ft from there in a bedroom. In the bedroom, the device gets a stronger signal from the original router than from the extender
2020-05-30 21:48:50

Okay

So which means your connection was fine

The extender only extend the range but not speed.
2020-05-30 21:49:55

Shoukd the extender be decreasing the speed?

Yes

That's correct
2020-05-30 21:52:00

So...despite buying this product I should expect a reduced signal than I already am getting?

Correct
2020-05-30 21:53:16

It may increased the range and signal but speed was not.

So why did I buy this product?

To Extend network and have a nother Wi-Fi name.

My device is at the end of the routers range and keeps cutting out. My intent was for this device to address that. However the signal is worse through your product than without it.

  We use my dad's house across the road but didn't want to shell out nearly $100 / month for WIFI. Bought a wireless bridge kit, but the router is in the back of the house 50 feet away and didn't want to crawl under the house to run an ethernet cable for the bridge. Decided to try this, since it has an ethernet port. Using the tether app, easily connected it to the main router, then hooked up the wireless bridge to the range extender. Works almost perfectly, and keeps nearly half the original wifi speed. I did have to reset it once (unplug, plug back in) otherwise no issues.

I almost purchased other extenders in the $50 to $120 range! My place isn’t large, so this price point is perfect. I’m not sure how far the signal travels but do know that I was notified that the location I chose was a little bit too close.

  First of all, I should have returned this extender the moment I realized that no matter what I did the extender just did not deliver on its promises. It's likely either a bad one or just a cheap one. Who knows... But I don't get the good reviews then.Although I bought it a year ago, it was used barely for a month and only because I still thought I was doing something wrong.Buyers beware that I only was able to get just over 30Mbps out of this thing, no matter where I placed the device. And I tried 5 different spots in the house. My router's speed is over 150Mbps.30Mbps is also not that bad if one uses it specifically for a dedicated device. Here comes an interesting part.In one of the rooms with the signal problem I have a Fire TV stick that I use for streaming. Get this: with the signal status ""Fair"" from my router vs ""Very Good"" from the extender, my router outperforms the extender anyway. It's as if the extender could not ""sustain"" the signal. It says 30Mbps, but the delivery is as if it was, oh I don't know, maybe like about 5Mbps. And it's the same story no matter where I placed this extender. I tried using WPS configuration, then I tried browser based configuration. It did not matter. The results are always the same: 30 Mbps per speed tests, but my Fire TV Stick, while streaming anything, was constantly interrupting and I would get a ""waiting for a good signal"" spinning wheel.I contacted the support recently, diligently took screenshots of everything that was happening, and the response was: ""our range extender is just a product for network expansion. It will provide significant wifi signal strength and extend the wireless network to further areas, but it is unable to improve the wifi speed. So that is the reason why in the room with the signal problem you will get strong wifi signal from the extender but the speed is similar to the router's wifi speed in that room."" This reply from then ignored everything I described to them which pretty much the same thing I wrote here. They did not get that for some reason the extender's speed keeps capping at 30Mbps and that it has a problem transmitting the signal that yo-yo-s between 0 to 30.So, in the end, $18 wasted, no biggie, but I am now not certain other extender don't have the same problem.

  July 2019-Updated from 3 to 4 starsPurchased 2nd during Prime Deals ($11)After about 1 month of use, I noticed that the 1st extender seemed to erase or override the router signal for several of the devices set further away from the modem/router (showing no signal or connected with problems).  So I got a 2nd extender to keep closer to the router and with a bit of creativity set up a manual IP address for each device separate from the router. I recommend two different passwords for admin access so you know which device is which and don't forget to change/create a password for the router. I have restricted which devices can use which signal and this has seemed to make a difference with wifi strength consistency. I have not had to reset either of the extenders yet. If anyone has any thoughts on security/ privacy risk associated with using these extenders with the router or ways to improve security please comment.June 28-I paid $16 so thought it was worth a try. Compared to Belkin the customer service for this is terrible. I used other comments/reviews on amazon to finally get it set up.1st: I have a dual router, so this little guy only works on the 2.4 so don't bother looking for the 5.2nd: Plug into the wall as close to router as you can, and look at your router settings to find out what the ip address is so you can use that ip address to access the settings on the extender and enter password protection for the extender.3rd: I renamed the extension so I could see/select which wifi signal is stronger.4th: Unplug and move to location were the extender light is not red but as close to the areas you need the wifi signal boosted.Functionally this little extender had made a huge impact on my iphone wireless. For some reason the last OS update made my wifi unstable. This extender has resolved the issue for the most part. For the upstairs it seems to have improved the signal strength, however I have signal issues with the fire tv. I have yet to need to reset it and it has been about a week. Hopefully it will keep working.

  1) Setup more difficult than expected. Pressing TPS button on router changed my existing wifi password, as well as giving it to the new _Ext device, with no word to me about what that new password was. Had to query my original router, edit the password back to normal there, then manually do the setup on the new wifi device. If in doubt, I recommend doing the manual setup from the start.2) Device needed to be unexpectedly close to the original wifi router: out the office door, down the stairs, directly across the small family room, about 40' as crow flies. Even 10' further, at other side of fireplace in family room, would not work.3) Amplification (as shown in bandwidthplace.com upload and download tests) was good only in the family room itself. It was actually poorer than the original in the adjoining dining room, where we'd most wanted it. This was 50' from original router, only 30' from the extension; the original had twice the bandwidth as the extension.

  TP-Link N300 WiFi Range Extender seems to be a very well made product as well as being easy to setup and us.Pros:* Ease of Configuration.  The quick installation guide simple to follow.  It has 3 methods of installation to chose from: (1) via wPS button, (2) via Web Browser, (3) via Tether App* Setup complete in less than 5 minutes*Signal strength from device is very good*Able to lock onto weak primary WIFI signal to be able to extend range significantly.* Sustains multiple video channels being played on multiple devices at same time.* Additional configuration settings available via Web Browser login to TP Link device.* Ability to ""copy"" or duplicate the SID of primary WIFI device to create an always on effect no matter where you're at in our campus network* Reliable WIFI extension... I've yet to experience any issues with my WIFI via this range extender* It Works and Simple to USE.Cons:* 3 Methods of installation... choice can be confusing for some.  It's not evident to average person which route to take.  The simplest is via WPS button (Method 1).* No additional information manual about functions available to manage via web browser* GNU General Public License booklet... SO WHAT, does anyone even read this stuff.  Save the tree and include a link in the Quick Installation guide and have it electronically available.I've use multiple devices to achieve WIFI range extension in the past.  Most with success, but none have been so quick and easy AND reliable.  I'm actually using this device to extend range of a ""private"" campus network that I manage. It enables a classroom access to an otherwise unusable WIFI network and where Ethernet cable is not able to be run at the current time.Would I recommend? YES, without hesitation.  It does exactly what it is designed to do.I even bought a second for my house.

  This wifi extension is constantly dropping out while all the lights are on, and there is no problem with the settings or firmware. It will simply say ""connected, no internet"", and this happens at least a dozen times a day. I finally had to put it on a WeMo switch so I could remotely reset it, that way it works without me having to get up in the middle of the night while trying to watch Netflix. I have contacted customer service, they have provided speedy replies, but essentially just ask you to repeat the same troubleshooting procedure over and over again.

  I got this to extend Wifi service into a back bedroom and main dining area, as it had great reviews. After using the WPS feature on my router to pair it to the unit (as per the manual), the lights did what the manual said they would do. I plug the extender into a wall socket that has line of sight with both the router and the devices that need wifi, in an L shape configuration. The devices that need wifi are at 48-56% connection strength, with the extender plugged in, or not. Both lights are on solid blue on the extender, which the manual states means it is working. So obviously, something is wrong. I they try method #2 in the manual, yet none of my 3 devices I tried were able to locate the extender's network. I reset the extender, and still it isn't broadcasting a network. So I gave up. It's  sunday, in a long holiday weekend, and there is a Category 5 hurricane about 100 miles off shore. Maybe I will try tech support next week.

  This thing works so incredibly well and it was so simple to set up I’m kicking myself for not buying one sooner. I had an entire section in my house that had spotty Wi-Fi at best. You would literally have to turn the Wi-Fi off on your cell phone or the pages would never load up for example. Now all the pages load up with lightning speed and there’s no more buffering on the Roku that’s in the guest bedroom. This thing was kindergarten simple to set up. Literally plug it in push one button on each end of the set up and wait for the solid lights. Then you move it to a permanent location wait for the solid lights and you’re GTG. Most important thing do not forget to find your new EXT and login with your old password. I hope this thing lasts because otherwise I can’t find anything negative about it whatsoever.

  Worst piece of tech I’ve purchased in years.I like it’s design. I even like the app available to help properly configure it. I want to like the device. But it won’t stay connected for more than 10 minutes at a time. And when it reconnects after several minutes, the app tells me I should move it further away from my main router because it has a “strong” signal.Well, I agree I SHOULD be able to move it further than 15’ from my main router. Especially considering I can see my main router from the location of the extender. I mean, there’s not a single wall between the two. And yet, as I’ve been typing this, the extender has been offline, back online, offline again, and back online. And when I DO move it further from my main router, as suggested by “Tether,” the configuration app, it will drop offline immediately and stay offline for hours, days, or seemingly indefinitely. I have spent HOURS unplugging and plugging it, resetting it, reconfiguring it, etc., and each time it is just as unreliable as the time before.Currently, there is only one client device to which I need this extender to provide a connection: my Ring Pro video doorbell, located about five feet from (and on the other side of a wall from) the extender.When I checked the Ring app a moment ago, I found that I’m missing the last two days of footage from the doorbell camera.Amazing.Please read other reviews before you purchase this product. This is my experience and it seems to be vastly different from that of most others who have purchased it. Compare your situation to those of Amazon shoppers who were pleased with the performance of this device. Or maybe just note that there are more highly rated extenders available in the same price range and consider one of those.When making your decision, just remember that, in the end, an unreliable range extender may cause you far more frustration than the wifi deadzone it’s meant to bring to life.Full disclosure - as I continued writing this review, the extender seemed to maintain its network connection the whole time. mayne its not as terrible as I’ve made it out to be. But — all things considered, over the four months I’ve owned it, it has been nothing, if not consistently unreliable.

  I paired mine utilizing the WPS connection method.  As noted in the instructions, I had to repeat the process to achieve 2.4 and 5.0 GHz connections.  I stumbled a bit on this as the first attempt went smoothly, however it seemed I had to fuss a bit to get the 2nd band to connect.  The upside to this is, it configures the device with the same SSIDs/Passwords.I then moved the repeater to the garage, which is about 25 feet from the router (source).  The 2.4 GHz signal is rock solid, however the 5.0 is right on the edge.  Sometimes it is red, sometimes it is green.  It's understandable given the higher frequency band is more sensitive to obstacles.  Even with that, the 5.0 GHz is working well.  I was getting about 50 MBPS on the download, which is quite sufficient for my needs.

  Nice product! As others said, it is indeed easy to setup and configure as there are detailed instructions. It boosted the signal pretty good both for a PC and mobile phone. I took one star off as there is no information about the manufacturer or the website where a firmware upgrade file can be downloaded. The manual says download ""from our website"", but none is provided, that's odd! When I searched by the device name, ""WF8500"", I found only a closely related (by item name) Samsung washing machine and Epson printer in top results... When I attempted to go to slopehill.com (the Amazon seller ""slopehill""), this web address was not valid (actually listed for sale), so it must be not the manufacturer name. No clue from the item itself, its box, enclosed instructions or description on its Amazon web page. Fortunately, a firmware upgrade is optional step, and the WiFi signal was boosted already. There was a couple of other minor issues. 1) The Installation Guide says that before starting, check if there's anything missing in the package, and contact your dealer of purchase to claim for missing items: 1xWiteless-N Repeater, 1x RJ-45 Networking Cable, 1x Quick Installation Guide. RJ-45 cable was not included, but I don't see on the Amazon product description page. This option (using a a cable) is optional, and you can configure a new network wirelessly, or use your own RJ-45 cable, but the Guide seems outdated as is. Ok, the repeater is cheap already, fair enough :-) 2) There is a ""USB charging interface"" on the Repeater from both the Amazon product page and Installation Guide, but it's function is not described. I presume it is not required for charging the device, but possibly provides an option to connect to a USB port to power this Repeater if there is no AC outlet? 3) The Amazon product description listed 2 other features - ""Guest Mode"" and ""Fast Charge"", but these are not addressed in the Quick Installation Guide (and no website address as I mentioned above).Within our apartment we lose signal in one of the back bedrooms which just happens to be the master bedroom.  This obviously creates issues if we want to watch YouTube while laying in bed which is why I wanted to get a Wifi extender to see if we could boost the signal.  Upon plugging the booster in and running a speed test we saw great improvements in both upload and download speeds in that room. Purchased this wifi extender to help get a stronger connection for our skybell wireless doorbell. We were getting laggy videos and slow alerts when we had a recorded video. My husband purchased this wifi repeater to hopefully get the skybell functioning at at least 85-90% for better videos and faster alerts. My husband was able to set up the repeater as an extender very easily. The instructions are easy to follow and within 30 minutes we had it completely set up and plugged into the outlet nearest the skybell, we are now getting 92%. We tested the videos and alerts and all are working as the should. Before getting this extender we were thinking of returning the skybell. This extender was what we needed to complete the doorbell upgrade at a great price. I recommend this repeater to anyone needing an extender or access point to add to their existing wireless network. You won't be disappointed.

  I am a TP-Link guy.  My whole house has become TP-Link over the past two years based upon the quality and stability of their products.  My TP-Link Archer C9 router came with the ability to use the Tether app to manage the router.  This Range Extender replaced a Belkin I had and this Range Extender is also managed through the Tether app.I have TP-Link smart plugs, smart bulbs and smart switches and I use the TP-Link ""Kasa"" app to manage those items (I note that some newer range extenders are listed in the Kasa app as well).  So while I need two apps to manage everything I dont usually go between them as they serve two different sets of functions.Specific to this Range Extender the setup was easy (ish) - once I connected my device (chromebook) to the Range Extender and set my password I was able to set the 'host' networks (2.4ghz and 5ghz).  I had originally tried using my phone but the chrome browser on my phone didnt let me set my password.  From there I plugged and un-plugged the range extender and using the Tether app checked the signal levels (using Location Assistant) until I found a good place.  Through the Tether app I know which devices connect through the Range Extender and which go through the primary router.Of the many smart home hardware/software manufacturers I find TP-Link to provide an overall more stable and secure product (I work for a fortune 50 company in software Security and evaluate such things professionally).  They continue to invest in the product line and are adding features (and security patches) at a reasonable rate.

  This review is on 2 purchases that arrived at the same time. I ordered both to compare.#1 Netgear AC-750 WiFi extender#2 T-P AC 750 Wifi ExtenderBoth about same priceNetgear 1st. Connected with WPS button, but could only connect to 2G only. Had to dig out the laptop to set it up with each band, 2G & 5G. Pretty straight forward, took around 10 minutes. I mounted in garage 75 feet away from home router. I'm using FIOS by Frontier, 150/150 on 5G. It does 50/50 on 2G.Up and running so its time for speed test. I tested both bands 5 times to get an average. 2G was 40 down, 30 up. 5G was 120 down 100 up.TP-Link AC750.WPS took 5 minutes to marry up. I did the double WPS but didn't get the 5G band. Had to go to website & set it up manually with passwords. No big deal, still an easy process. Time to test speed. Unplugged Netgear & put TP in same wall plug. Tested again like above, both bands 5 times for average. 10 down, 15 up on 2G. 40 down and 35 up on 5G.The Netgear outperformed the TP by almost 4 times the speed. My purchase was to speed up reaction time to 2 ISP cameras. Scrolling thru both cameras, the Netgear extender made the reaction time much faster.Both extenders were mounted 10 feet under the cameras, so the signal strength was 100% on both.Every situation is different, that's why I bought 2 different brands to test. I'll put the TP in the bedroom so the wife can have it. I'm sticking with the Netgear for performance....

  We hooked this up back in my wife's office that has a few walls between her desktop and the router.  She had pretty low speed back there at about 15 mps.  On WIFI, this bumped it up to about 20 mps, which is hardly worth the effort.  That said, it was close enough to run an ethernet cable to it and it bumped it to 80 mps.  Still not close to the 150 mps that is available in the rest of the house, but she's thrilled and it's all she needs, so I'm happy too.I tried hooking up a second one elsewhere in the house but both signals had the same name and so there was no switching, and often the phones and tablets would catch the weakest of the signals.

  We had a weak signal (which meant slow internet speeds) in one of the rooms furthest from the WiFi router, so we purchased one of these WiFi range extenders.Set-up was more complicated than it should have been, as the ""one-touch set-up"" didn't work, but logging into the WiFi extender using a web-browser and following the instructions was pretty straightforward.  TP-Link also offer an app, but I didn't try it.The signal is now strong in all areas of the house, and I have no issues with internet speeds.  It creates another WiFi signal that you need to connect to separately, but that wasn't a problem.  This only worked with the 2.4GHz signal, which is fine for us, but might be an issue for others.

  This AC750 dual band network extender works well and made it possible to stream TV to my Sony, which is situated in a dead spot.  The product works well and I have ordered a second one.  I think it is a workable alternative to the far more costly mesh systems.But  I was surprised to find so many reviewers remarking on its ""easy installation.""  It took me two days of patient experimentation and troubleshooting to actually  get it going.As a first step, I would recommend that you locate the tiny Reset pinhole next to the ethernet socket.  You can reset the device by jamming an opened paperclip into this hole and holding pressure until the status lights trill.  The reset returns the extender to its innocent, fresh start, just-out-of-the box condition, erasing any failed attempts to get the thing programmed and running. I  probably reset it 6 or 7 times altogether.You can establish communication with the device via a computer or a portable device.  There is an app called ""Tether"" that will run on your iPhone or iPad.  I installed Tether on my iPad and found that it could not ""see"" the AC750. There is no fallback other than a Reset of the AC750, which I tried.  It had no effect.  I then moved to a Dell Laptop, which worked much better.  It was able to find the AC750 and communicate with it.  But if you feel your way through the installation process without the Tether app, you may find you have made subtle mistakes that keep the system from working.  After a long period of online chat with a well meaning support tech, I realized he knew less that I did about the AC750.  Back to experimentation.  The installation via the Dell laptop went nowhere.  Finally, as a last resort, I went back to my iPad and the tether app.  By some miracle, one the second or third attempt, Tether actually discovered the existence of the AC750.  From that point the installation was pretty easy.  Only one more reset and I was home.Once you get through the installation the device is impressive.  Before the installation of the extender, at my TV, I was reading download speeds of 11 to 15 Mbps.  After I installed the AC750 I could get pretty consistent  results in the range 33 to 39 Mbps. More important, it became possible at last to stream TV.  Lessons: learn to Reset. Try to use theTether app -- if you can get it to work, it does a quick and accurate installation.  And don't give iup. Keep trying this and that. Eventually the thing will work.

  This range extender actually works great!  Installation was simple, you do not have to use the one touch WPS button unless you want to.  A lot of us have our own network name (SSID) and password.  Power it on, wait for the solid blue and then plug an ethernet cable in from the TPLink to your computer and type in the command. (its on your installation sheet).  Follow the simple instructions and you are up and running in 3 minutes.  Be sure you know your network name and password ahead of time, makes life easier.  After you get the 2 solid blue lights, unplug and install it in a electrical outlet approximately halfway between your HOME ROUTER and the ""dead spot"" in your home.  Numerous speed tests convinced me this is working great, 1mbps before and 16 mbps after installation!  I now have wifi in my backyard for streaming music and sports radio!  10 star rating for a product well under 20 bucks!

  I have a weird problem that inspired me to buy the TP Link N300. I have three active Surface Devices, A OG SurfaceBook, a SurfaceBook 2 and a Surface Studio that are setup in an area of the house that's not the best for WIFI reception. Regardless of this, the OG SurfaceBook and the SurfaceBook 2 connect to WIFI without problems, a high speed 5GHZ FIOS connection, and the connection is stable even if the signal strength isn't the best. The Studio though is the absolute worst when it comes to WIFI reception. Some days it connects fine and will run reliably for days. Then there are times when the Surface Studio will lose WIFI connection requiring repairing the connection through Windows 10. Sometimes, it's so bad that the Studio will lose connection again 30 seconds after WIFI has been reestablished, repeating this cycle for days. This is annoying to say the least. Initially I thought maybe Verizon was jerking us around with shotty service, but after putting the OG SurfaceBook and Book 2 as well as a Nintendo Switch through a series of WIFI tests over the course of a week or so, it was clear that the problem was specifically with the Surface Studio as every other device was able to maintain connection even though the signal strength wasn't the best.Consulting with other Surface Studio users, as well as some Surface Pro users, it seems they were having the same problem with WIFI. Microsoft doesn't seem to care because the solutions they've provided that I've tried, including typing code in a command line, didn't work so that left me to address the only sensible option. Move the Studio closer to the router (which isn't feasible due to my current set up) or extend the WIFI signal so the Studio isn't struggling to maintain connection.TP - Link N300 to the rescue!So, while browsing the news feed a few days ago, I saw that Amazon was having a sale on WIFI extenders. Great timing! Exactly what I needed. The reviews for the N300 were awesome so I decided to buy two because they were so cheap. They arrived and setup was super easy, another win! But then I hit a snag. The N300 is only a 2.4GHZ extender. I needed a 5GHZ extender. Suckage...😭😭😭Not quite what I needed but good enough for now...Since I've already committed, I decided to test drive the N300 with the Surface Studio and it's working great. Signal strength is much better (as I type this), no loss in connection. Of course download speeds are going to take a bit of a hit at 2.4GHZ but that's not the manufacturer's fault, that's my fault for not reading the device description more thoroughly.Conclusion - It works and setup is easy5* - if you are still using 2.4GHZ and need a WIFI extender with easy set up, you absolutely can't go wrong here. I used the Browser method to setup the N300 to avoid monkeying around with the FIOS router or a mobile app and it's been great. But if you're strictly using a 5GHZ WIFI connection then I can not recommend this device because it doesn't support 5GHZ connections. I had to re-enable 2.4GHZ on the FIOS router at home because Verizon in what passes for wisdom, disabled 2.4 GHZ some time ago as if no devices use it anymore (Protip: some still do, exclusively). Fortunately, re-enabling 2.4GHZ so long ago makes the N300 viable to me today when it would not have been otherwise.

",5.0 ,Matt,"Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2019","









  
  
    
  I ran a hard line cat6 from my router in my office across my house via the attic into my master bedroom where this unit is plugged in. It took just a bit of online searching to find out I needed to go into the device settings and change it to Access Point Mode in order to make use of my hardline, which was super simple once I found the instructions. You just go into the management page which the instructions direct you to, and there is a button on the top right that says ""mode"". You click this and select the option ""access point"" instead of ""range extender"" and it reboots the extender.  That is all there is to it to make use of a hardline and create a signal as if you were sitting right next to your router! You do have to create a new network name and password. After researching, my understanding is that you can make it the same as your current wifi login name and password and the device will ""somewhat"" switch on its own, but creating a new network name and logging in manually is the guaranteed way to keep a strong signal.  Try them both and see what works for you, I named this one ""Master"" and manually connect to it whenever I am in bed or our master bath. Takes a few seconds and guarantees max signal. We always had trouble with the signal in our bedroom and master bathroom, this fixed that COMPLETELY for 16 bucks and 1 wire. Awesome! I mainly wanted to post about my experience with the hardline because most people just use this in Range Extender mode (extending the range of existing wifi without any hardline). Figured this review may help someone out that intends to use it wired like I am.

  Seems to be working well for its intended purposes. One thing I didn't realize immediately was that do to the nature of how extenders operate, they run at 50% of whatever your good signal regular wifi gets.  So our internet is 60mbps, so the extended network pulls as perfectly solid 30mbps down connection. For the user on the extended network this is totally fine and perfectly fast for all kinds of tasks so works great here.Extender is basically at one end of the house and the router is at the other, both on the same wall, on the same floor, and with direct line of sight. Intended user is on the floor above, and then on the exact opposite wall parallel to these devices. Signal is excellent! No issues at all, I found the setup very easy and away we go.Without the extender we were getting 2-5mbps down with very low signal, and bad consistency in speed. With maybe occasional spikes to 15 mbps.With the extender, as mentioned its a solid 30mbps with perfect signal. Given our internet speeds the extender is operation 100% perfectly.All for a super low reasonabele price. Very happy so far~

    Does NOT ""extend"" your existing Wi-Fi SSID
  
",2.0 ,Ben S.,"Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2019","









  
  
    
  We just recently setup our spare bedroom as an office, and the Wi-Fi coverage was not great. We got this range extender thinking it would mesh with our existing network. The setup guide actually tells you there are two methods to set it up in extender mode: 1) Copy the existing Wi-Fi SSID, or 2) Create a new SSID to broadcast (i.e. (1) Main Wi-Fi Name: ""WiFi-abcd"", Extender Name: ""WiFi-abcd"" vs. (2) Main Wi-Fi Name: ""WiFi-abcd"", Extender Name: ""WiFi-abcd_EXT""). Although we were able to ""see"" the improved signal strength, we started to have daily issues with all of our Wi-Fi dropping out intermittently in both the main and extended network coverages. Sometimes our devices would still be ""connected,"" but have the 'little or no connection to the internet' warning. It isn't our ISP either because the connection issue disappears when we use a wired connection. I tried optimizing our Wi-Fi in a congested neighborhood, and I discovered that nobody was on the 2.4Ghz channel 8. When I set our main Wi-Fi to broadcast on that channel I discovered the extender started broadcasting on that channel as well. It was only then that I realized there was probably some destructive interference going because the two Wi-Fi radios were broadcasting the SAME SSID ON THE SAME CHANNEL FREQUENCY. I looked through all of TP-Link's settings and documentation, and there is nowhere that you can change the extended network's broadcast channel. The only setting I found is if you switch it to AP mode, but that won't work for us because it is a distance problem not a 'we don't have an existing Wi-Fi network' problem.I just can't believe the creators of a Wi-Fi extender RADIO didn't consider the basic lesson about DESTRUCTIVE INTERFERENCE that every electrical engineer learns on like day 2...We have had moderate improvement by switching the extender to broadcast a completely separate SSID (i.e. option 2 above - ""WiFi-abcd_EXT""), but it was NEVER our intention to have to create two separate Wi-Fi networks that we have to setup TWICE on every device.

  Works well but not quite what I was expecting.  So this device does not really extend your range of WiFi it makes a new connection.For the simple explanation if you have devices like TV, computer etc that will stay in location where the extender is then it works fine, as you can connect direct to this instead of the router.For detailed read below:For example if your using both 2.4 and 5 and say you have them named A and B for the ssid on your router this device is making a new dual connection so you would have now 4 visable connections so now you would see ABCD.Yes you can keep the naming the same and essentially program the extender with the same name and same password, but by doing so I was getting reduced signal because sometimes my devices would connect to the extender and then sometimes to the router.

  I almost got sucked into buying a razzy--and expensive--wifi extender unit. I realized, I don't need dual band coverage, I just need a wifi signal in my detached garage so I don't waste precious dolla bills listening to podcasts over cellular data. My garage is about 30 feet from the house. I plugged the unit into a socket near the backdoor in the house and, voila, wifi in the garage. It's really at the max though, and I have to keep my phone near the front of the garage to ensure coverage, but for 19 bucks, it's way cheaper than going over my allotted gigs of data every month. Well worth it for a fast and dirty solution.

  I bought this to go in my new house, as it is two stories with pretty thick walls and I have a somewhat cruddy modem/router combo (SBG6580, I believe) that I got on sale and worked well enough at my old house. Unfortunately, while my computer is only around the corner, the ""line of sight"" to it from the router goes through two exterior walls and my signal was horrible. The upstairs barely got reception.I set this up using the WPS first, and it worked quite easily. I just waited for the unit to boot up (30 seconds or so), hit the button on it and it flashed, then I hit the WPS button on my modem and the unit cloned my wireless setup.After I could tell it was working, I decided that I wanted to be able to tell if I was on my main router or the extender network, so I cleared the unit (held down the button for 10 seconds or something like that) and then plugged into it using an Ethernet cable and set it up manually. This was also very easy, with a simple interface that worked without any issue. It automatically recommends the custom name of <your network>_EXT which I decided to use.When I'm most places downstairs, the main router seems to have the best signal, though occasionally it's the extender. When I'm upstairs, I get full signal at all corners of the house.Just a note: this does NOT require any powerline hardware. I originally bought this along with the TP-LINK powerline adaptors, thinking it was going to broadcast the powerline signal wirelessly. Instead this is a simple repeater/amp that doesn't require any other hardware (aside from having a functioning wireless router, of course)

  UPDATE 9/25/19- Changed to 1 star. This product has been randomly disconnecting from my wireless connection for the past few months. Considering I bought this to use for wireless surveillance cameras, this means that routinely I have an error from my app stating that the base station is offline because the extender needs to be unplugged and plugged back in. While I’m at home, this proves to be an annoyance. When I’m out of town, this is unacceptable and makes an expensive security system useless. Will have to move base station next to modem, which negates the whole reason I bought this item. Return window closed, frustrating.Original: Purchased this product because my router is in a room far away from some wireless cameras I have, and this allowed me to run a cat5 from the camera router to this extender in a room closer to the cameras and increased their ready times in my viewing app.This product also had the added bonus of increasing my overall internet speeds on all devices. One of the pictures I uploaded is of my home network and the faster speed one is when I connected to the 5g extender and ran the same speed test on the same site. I would recommend grabbing this if you're trying to extend your range but also if you want to see a small increase in your speeds.

  I've had odd problems with wifi signal in my bedroom. It's about 20 feet away from the router however I get intermittent wifi and needed a solution for this. This extender seemed cheap and would resolve my issue. Install is really simple and got it hooked up in a couple minutes. As far as speed, I have FIOS Gigabit internet so I'm accustomed to 500Mbps+ speeds. While this one is rated for up to 300Mbps speed, I get no where near that speed with this extender. After a couple Speedtest connection tests, the best I got was 30Mbps. In most cases this wouldn't be acceptable. Speeds are dismally slow compared to what I should be getting. However, I have stable wifi connection in my bedroom now so I guess that's the biggest benefit here. Rather than having the internet cut out every minute or so, this extender gives me a stable connection throughout the day. While the speeds are abysmal, I at least have connection now.

Next I connected my windows tablet and set it up through the website (of course no windows app).  When I got to the last page there was no next button because the webpage wouldn't format to my having my tablet on a higher scaling setting, ok not that big of a deal just sloppy web programming.  So after that the TPlink reboots.  I can see it on my wifi list for a few seconds then it disappears.  I downloaded a wifi analyzer and it seems the TPlink signal goes ""out of range"" for several minutes, then it might go into range for a few seconds, and so on.  So I can't connect to it at all.  I'm assuming it's a hardware issue, but it only does it after it's setup, before it's setup it seems to have a good signal.

  I bought this to give a stronger WiFi signal for my SENS8 upstairs (back of the house from the router). Before installing the WiFi extender upstairs, my SENS8 would constantly drop the WiFi signal and not work to monitor the side gate and back door of my house. After installing this WiFi extender upstairs, my SENS8 has a solid connection all the time now.An added bonus of having the WiFi extender upstairs is now my Netflix doesn’t drop when I try to watch tv in bed.There are 3 ways to hook up the extender to the WiFi—the first and easiest way didn’t work for me, so I had to use the website way. Neither of them were complicated, and I appreciated the fact that they include instructions for 3 ways. Once connected, it was easy to relocate to a place in my house to extend the signal.I’ve seen a lot of reviews of people complaining the signal is not boosting the WiFi—it doesn’t do that. It’s best use is for technology that is far from the router, that occasionally loses signal due to its distance from the router. Think of it this way: the extender just allows for the signal to reach technology farther from the router than normally possible without it.

I really, really tried to make it work and hate leaving bad reviews as I always assume user error may be a variable but this was a fail due to the product. Sorry but I leave reviews as a great company mitigates risk by identifying issues and addressing them to eliminate deficiencies in a product or process. I’m rooting for y’all.

  I have a smallish apartment, 1200 sq. ft. But it is long with one bend in the hallway. I called the manufacturer to see if this extender would serve my purpose. The rep said it would. Unfortunately it has not. It works intermittently and but mostly not at all. There is no obstacles between my router and the extender but there is a sharp bend into the furthest room where I need the extender to reach. My walls are made of regular drywall. There are some large appliances in there that may be a problem. I'm not sure. Regardless, I do not seem to be able to return the extender. I don't know if the return widow has closed or what.

  I actually ended up returning this item. I purchased it to remedy dead spots in my wifi reception throughout my small 2 bedroom apartment. Not only did it not resolve that issue, but it created a whole new problem. First of all, let me be clear, I DO fully understand that this item is NOT intended to increase internet speeds. I did not expect, nor did I need it to do that! HOWEVER, it is NOT supposed to cause my existing ultra-high speed internet to slow to a snails pace. However, that is EXACTLY what it did. And I confirmed this multiple times, using three different independent speed test applications.  The one positive that I can say is that Amazon has absolutely AMAZING customer service and return/refund process! I was able to take the item, in its original box (no other packaging required) to my local UPS store, where they packaged it up for me (at no cost to me) and they took it from there. I live approximately 10 minutes from this UPS store and BEFORE I even got back home, my full refund had been issued and had already been credited to my my bank account. Wow, Amazon! Just WOW! I was NOT expecting that! I expected it to take several days to a week! So, the product = sucksAmazon customer service = ROCKS!!!

  One side of our house had a pretty weak wifi signal. Earlier I had installed another brand of wifi signal extender that gave us a signal, but a dodgy signal, in that part of the house. My spouse had an apple ipad that was really difficult to use in that part of the house. So I saw the TP-Link 300 wifi extender - I am pretty sure it was on sale. So I ordered one.I unplugged the other extender and plugged in the TP-Link. It works so much better than the one it replaced. Every once in a while it gets a 'hick-up' and needs to be reset, but it has pretty much resolved the weak signal issues. Easy to install and easy to set up.

  This is the first time I have used a WIFi extender.  All I had to do is plug it in click button (I forgot the name) that the instructions told me to press on my router and wait 2 minutes and hold down the button for one second on the extender.  The blue light went from blinking to steady and the instructions said if that happens it worked.  I found the name on my PC settings (I didn't change the name from my original wifi and the signal strength was great.)  I am typing this review from a part of my house that I normally would never get a signal from.  Very happy with the results.

  After doing some internet research, and watching a couple of YouTube videos, I figured out how to set up the TP-Link, and I'm glad I did.  I live in a 3K square feet house and the last 1K feet, located in the back where the master bedroom lives, along with a Roku and a Sony TV, showed a download speed of between 4-6 Mbps depending on the time of day.  After installing the TP-Link, and setting up the equipment to connect at 5GHZ,  I was getting a download speed of 18-25 Mbps.  The improvement in streaming services was immediately noticeable, as was my iPhone wireless connection while sitting on my back deck drinking my morning coffee.  I've had this product now for months, and there hasn't been one occasion where the wireless dropped off or the speed dropped below 18 Mbps.  The bottom line: highly recommended, with the caveat of doing your research before attempting setup.  It will save you a lot of heartaches.

  In My situation, wifi signal before was too weak, like less than one bar. 5min YouTube video -> 15min waiting.With this, No worries about signal anymore.Pro.1.It is not extending same wifi signal range. It catches the current wifi signal, amplify and making a ""new"" wifi <- Which is great for me.  I shared main wifi router with other roommates. I don't want to share my weak-one-little-amplified signal to another.2. I cannot access the wifi router so I'm not available to check my router has a WPS button or not. But this machine doesn't require any physical interaction with the main router. You can setup thru internet browser.

  Update: After 7 days using the TP-Link N300 WiFi Extender, I have to reduce my rating from 5 to 2 stars.I have tested the unit intensively, in different time windows and different days. I measured the download speed frequently and switched between different routers.The unit has a big flaw. Although the WIFI download speed is increased about 30% but it behaves very strange.After every click on a new website link, it has a delay of 2-4 seconds before the first elements of the website is displayed. It even causes the same delay on the WIFI of connected router.I am going to return the TP-Link N300 WiFi Extender.Today I received the TP-Link N300 WiFi Extender. I used the installation via web browser; it was very easy.So far it works well. Compering to the direct WIFI connection of the router, the speed through the Extender is increased about 30%.

  Had to hard reset the device and plug my laptop into the rj45 port to complete setup, since the mobile app kept finding the device but repeatedly failed to complete setup. I tried the app setup via 2 phones and 1 tablet before going to the laptop. Considering I have several TP Link smart outlets, I expected the repeater to work w/out issue.Signal strength received from my router to the repeater is strong, and only about 30-40 ft apart. I got it because the walls can sometimes cause issues.Even though this says it supports 300mbps, something as simple as casting to a roku only 3ft from the repeater via youtube tv results in video degradation to the point you can't read simple scores from a football game displayed on the screen.Switching the roku connection back to the primary router immediately fixes the issue even though it had weaker signal.When I connect my phone to the repeater, it often will not get web connectivity even though the reception level is 100%.No, I haven't done any speed testing, it's a $13 device that kinda works for basics like web surfing on my phone, when it decides to show connectivity.

Actually the signal is VERY GOOD once I figured the whole thing out.  The 3 stars is up from #1 as it still took me several hours of trial and error for me to figure out.I was unable to sign on using the extender address EXT.  It sinced up with my router just fine.  When talking to tech support they identified the problem but it was going to cost 5X the cost of the equipment for them to get into my computer to clear out the problem items in my system. Rated a #1 at this point.

  With all the technology and routers and modems and updates and bugs that I don't even try to keep up with any more, buying this wifi extender proved that it doesn't have to be complicated!  I live in a small house, but my existing router signal has to go thru walls, thus reducing the signal strength to only 1-2 bars when I'm in the livingroom.  Hard to use my tablet and phone sometimes.  Took a chance, and am SO HAPPY with this product!  I plugged it in to the wall in the livingroom, hit the button, then went to the router 2 rooms away and hit the button.  Voila!  All I had to know was my ROUTER PASSPHRASE/WORD in order to link the tv, tablet and phone to the extender.  That's it!  Now I have ALL BARS and no delays at all in the livingroom.  :-)

  I tried using this to boost 2g signal in back of house, but all it did was wreak havoc on my iPhone 10 and caused it to keep forgetting my hidden real 2g and 5g networks.  Since this device would not let me hid the SSID, I am guessing my phone kept trying to connect to it instead of the real networks had programmed into it.  So even when not in back of house, my phone would forget it could connect to the real network.  Also my smart devices in my house started going bonkers too, and disconnecting from real network requiring me to re-program them the proper network, like my thermostat.Overall I was pretty dis-satisfied with this... and OMG, it is slower than a snail.  I could occasionally get 20Mbps, but no where near the 300Mbps that is advertised.  I have super high speed XFinity network, so I am used to blazing fast wi-fi, but this device in my house peaked out around 20Mbps, NOT 300Mbps.

  I'm rating this 5 stars, but please note that I have only had this thing set up for an hour at this point. I'll come back and adjust my review if my opinion changes.First, the initial impressions.1. The box is small. It's a little larger than a light bulb box that would hold a single light bulb.2. The box is shrink wrapped. Ugh. Minor inconvenience, and minor amount of non-recyclable material. (Suggestion to TP Link: Don't shrink wrap it!)3. The device is TINY! It's the size of a stinking night light! (I'll include a picture of it plugged in.)4. You take it out of the box, and plug it in.5. You turn on your computer, select the temporary WIFI network ""TP_LINK_something_or_other"", open a browser, type in an address, and 2 minutes later you're all set up.I purchased this to add WIFI to an outdoor area that wasn't getting any signal from inside the house. Now, I have ""all the bars"" sitting outside. Exactly what I wanted as a result, and surprisingly painless to get set up and working.Pros:1. Small2. Easy to set up3. Seems fast4. All packaging is easily recyclable (except for the stupid shrink wrap)5. The box design is honestly and obviously brilliant! (not that you care, because you just take it apart and recycle it)6. I checked signal strength using the WiFi Scanner program. Everything looked great.Cons:1. The setup process could have been slightly more automated using the automated WIFI login feature (like the first time you go to Starbucks), so you didn't have to type in a URL (very minor)2. Shrink wrap (very minor)So at this point, I'm very happy.

  Bought this to extend the signal to an area far from the router. Located it halfway and it worked great. Very easy to setup. This was a inexpensive solution as opposed to the cable companies $130 a piece device, although the cable company techs said it wouldn't work with their equipment. That was wrong. The only negative is it's a single band (2.4G) as opposed to having both 2.4 and 5G which is only about $10 more. As far as I know, 2.4G has a longer range but is slower as more items in your home use that band. 5G is faster and even though the location I bought the extender for shows a full strength signal, the 5G signal is faster showing only 2 bars.

  Our new home has a few WiFi “dead zones” upstairs, as our modem and router were downstairs in the living room. This extender works very well to solve that issue!

The upstairs now has a much stronger signal and we are able to connect all our devices to stream as needed.The only negative is the fact that now something additional has to be plugged into the wall, and it’s not very discrete, however I am willing to sacrifice having an additional thing plugged in for the usability that this provides.

It worked for a few hours and then the one device attached to it showed poor signal strength.I attempted to connect the extender a 4th time following instructions for reset and it connected but lost signal after 1 hour.At this point if I can not rely on it to maintain signal it is pointless to have the device.

  At first I didn’t understand how to connect it but then I saw there’s a WPS button on top and also on the router there’s a WPS button when you press both it will have two minutes to connect then there is a TP link app that you connect your extender to the router with the WIFI settings then any device that you will be connecting to the extender you change that devices WiFi to the extender. It definitely works because my room is at the back of a house where there’s metal in a wall my movies and everything used to disconnect and buffer since using the extender the movies play because the extender is halfway between me and the router.

  This is a life saver. Great product for large houses or multi-level townhouses. This thing actually seems to have better range than my router at times. The only annoyance is that it's a separate broadcast so you have to switch between networks. It doesn't extend the current wi-fi network, it creates a new one with the same credentials, so if you are in range of both and move around, you might be on a weak signal. Just be mindful of this, it's not a big annoyance, and I still recommend it especially for the price point relative to others.

  This was really easy to set up with WPS - I bought two, with the primary function as range extenders for our upstairs and out in the garage where I had noticed some slightly weaker signals (love FiOS but the modem leaves a bit to be desired).The main thing is to just be a bit patient during setup and let it work as intended - it does, just trust the process. I'm glad to not have to download another app and just have this work seamlessly.It also just looks really nice. Form follows function, but nicely, with an attractive profile and compact size. Almost worth buying for that alone.

  The product is fine.  The problem I (and MANY MANY MANY) others had was that the device was losing communication with my router.  It would happen at least once per 24 hours, but more often a couple times per day, so any devices connected through this range extender would not be able to use the internet until this thing was powercycled.  So digging on the internet for a lot of my time, I found a work-around and finally what seemed like a solution.  The work around, according to multiple articles, was to run a constant ping to the extender in intervals of 2.5 seconds or shorter.  I didnt do that.  Iam on day 3 now of it working without interruption.  I had to search their site, download the 12/2019 US firmware, log into the device with a laptop that was connected to it, and manually install the firmware patch.  You cannot just run a firmware update without downloading it first.  Pretty inconvenient!Now I am not all complaints.  It works well when it is working, and the issue now seems resolved.  I got it for around $20 and it came pretty fast during quarantine.  I hope this helps people who have it or another of their products and are experiencing the same type of issues.  I will probably research and purchase a different brand in the future if I need something like this again.

  Using the WPS method product install went smoothly. HOWEVER, my HSI service dropped by 50% or less when any of my devices connected to it. For example, speed tests, when connected device directly to my HSI modem,  provided by the vendor, is 50mps up/down. When I connect to the extender it drops to 25mps, or less, up/down. I spent a couple of hours researching the issue, trying to determine if it was an extender configuration issue, results, negative. Reached out to their support, person was not helpful; extent of help was ""reboot you modem""; which I had done before reaching out to their support.  BOTTOM Line; returning product.

  Update: dropping to 4 stars, because it tends to need to be restarted at least weekly or it stops working. Definitely still better than other options I've tried though.My house is brick, which has given me a lot of issues in getting wifi from one side of the house (where the router is) to the other side. I tried other wifi extenders in the past and had a lot of issues setting them up, and had given up on getting one to work. However, adding outdoor security cameras meant really needing to have wifi on the far side of the house, so I read some reviews and wound up here.Setup is a breeze. Seriously, this thing was ready to go in 10 minutes. After that, I plugged it in on an outlet I thought would work and set things up.Now my wifi easily blankets the house, it even works when I'm out at the grill! What a great purchase, effortlessly extended my wifi for a really reasonable price. Wish I did this a long time ago.

  The price is good but the product it’s just ok, (the old saying you get what you pay for definitely holds true)I have this extender in my kitchen window (I had to use an extension cord otherwise I would not have a strong enough signal).My router is in my living room. The WiFi extender is approximately 25 ft from my router and still has trouble working. When I open my shades in the morning the WiFi extender will occasionally fall down from the top of the window. I had to position it here because it’s the only place in my house (1040 sqft) that is the closest to my garage (where I have WiFi cameras).My garage cameras often fail to work because the WiFi signal is too weak.Save your money and buy something else more powerful! I sure wish I did.

  I say that because of TP-Link support... The unit worked great for 1 day and then went out. This is connected to a TV in the Sunroom and I don't feel like running ethernet to it. I contacted Support a few days later because it is not a TV that is used a lot during the day time. I got the run around of you to need to unplug it and plug it back in again. I told them it is not serving out the DHCP address to the unit anymore. Well, we need to get to the GUI. I can't log in on my phone, laptop (wired or wireless), tablet. Then back to resetting the unit... Waste of 3 hours... I may change my review if I get another one, or I just may hack an old router to do the same and get more ports out of it rather than 1. If you get one make sure its not ver. 1.0 that is what I had and it is junk!

Plug it in close to the router first then follow the PC option to connect on laptop or desktop cause cell might not be good enough After connection is successful, take it to desired dead zone and it will coonect automatically. I got Spectrum internet. With 200mbps speed. And that's what I get on my living room now. Real happy with it. Every house is different and have more or less obstacles to get the signal to the wifi extender but this one is worth the try. DO NOT GET THE ""RENEWED"" ones. More likely won't work according to reviews.

  We live in a log cabin and we were having issues with WiFi in certain areas of our home. Our tech guy recommended this brand of WiFi extenders. I won’t lie, was extremely apprehensive about this working.Initially ordered 2 extenders, one for Floor #1 and Floor #3. The tech guy figured out the weak area and the best place for placement of each upon his visit.When they arrived we followed directions and plugged in. Expecting mediocre at best... WRONG! It was an instant change and as long as our Internet is working these guys do their job, perfectly!Since first purchase I’ve ordered 3 more. One for floor #2 on the other end of house from where Internet box is, garage and shop. The shop is approximately 700 feet from our residence and it works perfectly. My husband is able to accept payments without coming to the house to process payment!You can’t go wrong with investing in these WiFi extenders. They most certainly do their job at an affordable price. Super simple to install. Customer service is the very good, as per tech guy.

",5.0 ,John Saxon,"Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2017","









  
  
    
  There's a bit of important information that nobody really wants you to know, and that is that wireless range extenders cut the speed of your internet in half or even worse. This is inherent in the deal since the extender has to use at least half the bandwidth to communicate with the base that it's receiving from. I wanted to set this up as a wired ""access point"" so that the speed would not be cut. After a couple of hours of frustration I finally figured out how to do this (the instructions, of course, are quite vague). You must log in to the extender with your computer's browser; you may have to tune in to the extender's wireless network instead of your own wireless network. Then, after setting up a new password you just change the ""mode"" to ""access point."" Then the extender will reboot, but here's the confusing part - you're done. Now just place the thing where it's going to sit and connect it via ethernet to your router. You will now have a new wireless network called TP-LINK_WA855RE. I guess you can change this to some other name; I'm not sure if it can have the same name as your base wireless network. At this point I'm reluctant to mess with it.I assume that setting the thing up as a wireless extender is very easy as well, but as I said, you will lose a lot of speed. I would not recommend this option if you're trying to stream video, etc.

  Several months ago we purchased a new Dell Inspiron 3671 desk top to replace our 7 year old model that was on its last legs.  So far the new Dell has been fine except for one minor issue.  Everytime it went to sleep mode when it woke up it was not connected to the wireless wifi in our home and we repeatedly had to power the modem off and on in order to get it to work.  I eventually called Dell and the tech tried to correct the problem but his conclusion was my wifi signal was not strong enough.  Told the tech we never had this problem with our old Dell desktop but he couldn't come up with any explanation except the network adapter was not as receptive to wireless signals as my old model.He suggested getting a wifi range extender since I was three rooms over from the DSL modem.  Based on the price and recommendations I purchased the tp-link range extender.  In setting it up today I found the instructions easy to follow and used Method three to connect via a Web Browser as I could not find a WPS button on my existing modem.  I located the extender about eight feet from my computer which now shows a much stronger wifi signal available.  Accessed the new extension network (.ext) and so far is working great.  Have brought computer in and out of sleep mode several times and it hooks right up to the network.  Extender is small but solidly built.  Based on my brief usage so far I would highly recommend this if you are having weak wifi issues.

  Slightly lower rating due to iOS weak security issue.To fully resolve the iOS “weak security” problem with the following steps:1. Validate that the primary router configuration is set to WPA2 AES only (not auto).2. In iOS, forget any network connections created related to the TL-WA855RE.3. Upgrade the TL-WA855RE to the most recent firmware. - full instructions are on the TP-Link support website.4. Withe the TL-WA855RE still plugged in, use the reset button and wait for it to fully restart.5. Download and use the Tether app and connect to the default network TP-Link_Extender.6. Follow all instructions in the Tether app to complete the setup process as normal. This will establish the connection to the main router and name the extender’s SSID.Once all above steps are complete, the iOS connection to the range extender’s SSID will no longer show the “weak security” warning message.Connections to the TL-WA855RE are now secure.

I needed to connect my office phone to an ethernet jack but did not want to run a 50 ft cable from the modem in my living room across the room and into my bedroom where I have my workstation set up. I found a different version of this device on a big box electronics store website, showed it to the manager at my company (small company) who handles ordering office equipment, and he purchased one here on Amazon. It took literally 2 minutes to set this up and get it connected to my WiFi, plug in my phone's ethernet jack, and be able to get a dial tone. The signal is great - my connection is just as good, if not better, than my internet connection at my office was. Was an excellent alternative to running a long cable across my apartment. I ended up buying one for my son because he was having issues with gaming on his computer and this gave him the ability to connect his computer directly to the ethernet port. No issues at all. Very happy with this purchase. Well worth the money spent.

  It worked REALLY well the first few times, I even suggested it to a friend who also bought it.  About the fourth time it started going ""wonky"" - some nights it would work and some it just wouldn't.  But now it will NEVER work - every single night for the past week or more it just says ""No internet, connected"".  What the heck is the point of that? If I had known I was just renting the use of an extender for a week or so rather than using a semipermanent solution I wouldn't have considered it such a deal.  A wi-fi extender with ""no internet"" is useless.  I'm better off with the one bar I had cutting off on me all the time than nothing at all.

  For some reason, the WPS Button didn't work which would have been the easy way. Problem with my modem? The Tether App was going well until login to the extended network. The app doesn't provide an ""enter"" button and for some strange reason, my Motorola G7 smartphone keyboard doesn't either. Bad design in both but I fault the Tether App because in all the various things I've done with the smartphone its lack of an enter key has never been a problem. Frustrating because I ran out of time and had to try again the next day. Using a web browser didn't connect at first so I connected with an ethernet cable and setup was completed quickly. Not much I can do about my not-so-smart phone, so tp-link, please fix the Tether App.

  We purchased this to get WiFi in another building in the back yard.  We use Spectrum’s WiFi. Outside we would get one bar from our AP but inside it would drop to nothing.  After installing we get max signal and 50mbps in the secondary building.  Now the cool part is you can shut off the leds on the device so it doesn’t make an annoying glow at night.  We have a long house 40’ x 70’.  Wireless AP is in the back and propane tank monitor (Tank Utility) is in the dome in the ground.  About 100’ away from AP.  Purchased another TP link and put in front bedroom.  Now tank monitor is working correctly for our generator LP tank.  Plus I get WiFi in front yard for listening to music while cutting grass! (Bonus!). This works for 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz WiFi.  I keep the SSID name the same so my devices don’t have to have the new SSID added to them.

  The unit seems to be of good quality, but I could not get it to connect to my 5 year old Frontier router.  Tried the method by pushing the WSP buttons and it couldn't connect.  Then logged directly into the network, registered it, and added the new network.  I could log in to the .EXT network, but the device could NOT establish a connection with my router.Tried using the online troubleshooter and it was no help, then tried calling customer service and gave up after being on hold for 20 minutes.Not sure if my router is just too old or if the device is defective.  Router is a Netgear ADSL2 D2200D.UPDATE:  After 2 hours of trying to work with Frontier, finally got them to update the router and  was able to get the range extender to communicate with the router.  It indeed boosted my signal and worked as advertised.  Added a star but still not 5 stars due to their confusing directions and impossibility in talking with customer service.

    All Plaster House and Extremely Weak WiFi

  I bought this because I have a lot of WiFi enabled items and extremely weak WiFi with low speeds. I also have a house with all plaster walls, some double thick, and those metal grates in the corners behind the plaster. My signal prior was fine, sometimes it would work, sometimes not, it seemed to depend on the way the wind was blowing outside (haha).I added this in one area of my house and it boosted the WiFi way out to my garage and down the street which was cool. However, my devices that were split right between both router and booster, were having connectivity issues and I could tell they were jumping. So I moved my booster to be in between device and router, and my signals are great. No connection issues, everything works all the time now. Wife is happier as well.Installation is as easy as plugging it into the wall and pushing a couple buttons, now I can unplug and replug anywhere in my house for better internet. It's great!

  There are 2 huge problems with this.1. It does not extend your wifi, it creates a second wifi with a different name and password. You have to change back and forth.2. It is significantly slower than stated. I have 300 Mbps in my house, and this gets 5 at best. I have tested this at a distance of about 10 feet from my router, and still have the same results.I had to get all my devices to “forget” this network because they would automatically switch to this network and slow to a crawl. So this is not being used at all in my house now.

  This is such a great little gadget. We have a two car detached garage and I could only get one bar on my Wifi signal if I stood in just the right spot and held my tablet just the right way when I was out there in my shop and needed to look something up or wanted to stream some music. Needless to say that was annoying. I set this Wifi extender up and plugged it into an outlet that was close to the garage and facing towards a window and now I can easily get 2 or 3 bars consistently. If you're not getting good results try a few different outlets. I originally had mine plugged into what I thought would be the best outlet, because it was the closest outlet in the whole house to the garage but that wall was a cinderblock wall and the signal had trouble getting through even though it was only about 10 feet from the garage.

  Cut the cord about 6 months ago and since then streaming and signal has been atrocious.  Spoke to cable rep inferring the signal sent out has been weakened since my cutting.  He assured me not and began to run some diagnostic checks on my equipment.  Hooked my laptop to and ethernet connection, switched devices to 5G network where possible  and lastly on his recommendation picked up an Extender (signal booster, amplifier), hence this review.  Went inexpensive not knowing if an Extender would work so I selected TP Link/N300 solely on the reviews both quantity and ratings..  It took all of 5 minutes to sync and set up...very simple instructions.  Originally saw no difference until I realized the Extender sets up a new network (yours plus the EXT suffix) and you have to switch your device to that new network.  Voile, signal went from fair to excellent and it was that simple.  Easy streaming, no buffering and didn't have to spend anymore than $15.  Give it a shot there is a very good chance this will help if you are experiencing the same problems as I was.

  I bought this hoping to provide a stronger network for my Ring camera. (Camera is only 20 feet from the router but is outside so has poor signal). The extender is about 8 feet from the Ring camera but provided no improvement in signal strength over the original network. Sometimes I can see the live Ring camera feed; sometimes I can't.Instructions with the extender didn't match my router (WPS button) so the quick setup didn't work for me- I had to download the Tether app and create an account which I didn't like. The app worked ok, though it still took many many tries for it to find ""see"" the extender.

  This does increase the strength of the wifi signal but the speeds are terrible.  I wanted to add a little more oomph to the wifi in a basement room.  My laptop got around 30-50mbps connected to the network as is, where my phone got about 20mbps.I put this extender in and the wifi signal is 1 to 2 bars higher however the speeds are atrocious.  I'm lucky if I get above 10mbps down.  See attached photos, 36mbps down when connected to original router.  8.9mbps when connected to the TPLink Extender.  Unacceptable.The only use I could see having for this is when I need a wired connection for an older device (like when setting up a linux install before wifi drivers).I am going to look at another model and see if I get the same performance, I plan on returning this.

  My Centurylink modem/router was not connecting to my printer in another room.  This printer had always connected okay before neighbors moving in next door started broadcasting their WiFi. I decided to try this little extender. It connected as noted in the setup.  BUT...my printer would not connect.  I downloaded the “Tether” application and was able to program the PIN from my router, into the Link hardware to get my printer to connect.I am beginning to think my modem/router was not working correctly using the WPS push button setup.  It took awhile messing around with the Tether software to get it to work, and I’m a retired software engineer.  This could be a problem for buyers not knowledgeable with networking.

  I received the model with the latest firmware and version number.Setup was a breeze, followed the instructions and it connected to my network just fine.Unfortunately, as far as doing what it's supposed to do, it works like crap. Constantly drops the connection, has to be rest constantly; one of our laptops, for instance, every day at some point it just loses connection and you have to go unplug this thing, plug it back in, wait for it to recycle, then reconnect the wireless, and 50% of the time I have to do this more than once in order to get Internet connectivity back.Signal is strong, I can connect to this unit great from multiple devices, it just doesn't *do* anything, I have no Internet connectivity. I'd like to be able to check the status with the app or through the support website, but seeing as I can't keep it connected long enough to actually read a webpage without having to go do the whole plug thing .... I can't figure out what the problem is.The Xbox (we use it for streaming) - once connected, I can stay connected. But if I turn off the Xbox, and then go back later to turn it on and watch something, there's a 50% chance I have to go unplug this and the router and then reconnect and all that.The laptop - Drops the connection every 15 minutes it seems. Dozens of times (and I'm sitting right next to the repeater!). Sometimes I can just disconnect and reconnect my wireless, but most of the time I have to go unplug/reset the repeater.The phone - the phone seems to be the only thing that doesn't seem to have an issue with this, but I'm not really on the phone that much so I might just be not using it enough to notice any shortcomings.Yeah, I know it's not the biggest hassle in the world, but the whole point of getting this was to extend my range so I could use things. If I spend all my time resetting the darn thing, and running up and down the stairs to keep resetting my router, what's the point? I'll just go sit closer to the router and not bother using this.Super disappointed. The tech support looks nice but if I can't stay connected I can't use the tech support.

  I bought this WiFi extender based on Wirecutter reviews which praised it for its signal strength and ease to install. I never found out about the strength because I could never get the extender installed properly—or at least securely—even after a 30 minute call with Tech Support. First, extender was difficult to set up since there was no WPA button on our router (which is a new/current one). When I finally got it working via my computer, I then moved it from the second floor router to the appropriate spot to replace an older and now broken extender that brought WiFi to the first floor of our house. But no matter what I did—even talking to Tech Support—the extender did not offer a secure WiFi network, to the point that my iPhone even refused to recognize it. I tried several things, talked more than 30 minutes with Tech Support before I just gave up and returned it to Amazon. Returned to my 6-year-old extender which continued to work OK until a thunder storm when it then died. So finally replaced with a more updated version of old extender (Securifi’s Almond) and was the simplest thing to set up ever...and works better than ever.

The internet shows I was watchin using TV Cast were freezing while buffering. AS soon as I received it and  follow the instructions and placed it half way between the wireless router in the middle of the downstairs. I tested it and seems to help where I was not getting as much buffering. The signals to my computers and Bluetooth upstairs and smart TV seems to increase a little. However, a few days later in watching an Internet TV show the same thing happened. Freeze of the video and buffering for a long time. That's when I realize that the range of this repeater is not strong enough and I should have bought a more expensive product. Maybe their business is for you to buy more than one and spread them all over the house.TP-Link Dual Band Wi-Fi range Extender a big disappointment.

  This wifi extender is easy to set-up and only takes less than a few minutes.  Its a basic plastic housing with 2 antennas and has light indicators to let you know when the signal is connected and strong.  I needed it to boost the signal downstairs in the TV room where I have a smart TV, firebox and Xbox.  I currently use a Verizon FIOS G1100 router.  I pressed the connect button on the router, then found the closest outlet to the router to plug in the wifi extender.  Once plugged in, I pressed the connect button on it.  It then took about 30 seconds to get all blue lights indication connectivity.  Then unplugged it and took it about 40ft away downstairs and plugged it in (no need to repeat the previous steps) halfway between the router and my TV room.  When setting up the wifi on your device, just look for your normal router name + EXT and put it the same password  Now I have full strength in what was once an unstable area.  Its been going strong for about a week without issue.  Most could use a wifi extender so at this price point, for what you get, it's a no-brainer.

No pedí un cambio o garantía xq soy de Costa Rica y el devolverlo me resulta más caro y claramente no me van a dar soporte de esta forma.Pero el que funciona a la perfección no ha dado ni 1 solo problema, y la red se distribuye supeer bien a lo largo de toda la casa.

    Consistently reduces available bandwidth - updated
  
",1.0 ,The Fishers,"Reviewed in the United States August 25, 2019","









  
  
    
  *** update ***I got a higher priced wifi extender that did the same thing as this one. I got more bandwidth simply connecting straight to my router. I now suspect the problem was periods of low bandwidth from my cable provider that led to our smart TVs sometimes not getting enough data to support an enjoyable watching show. Fair enough. Now I'll have to get on the cable provider if/when that happens again.-- original posting ---It was straight forward enough to get the ranger extender connected to my router, move to a location half way in between my router and the target devices, and then connect my devices to the ranger extender. However, the bandwidth available from the range extender is consistently less, sometimes 50% less, of the bandwidth available from simply re-connecting my devices to my main router. I played around with moving the range extender to different locations, I restarted my home router, etc. All to no avail. The whole idea of the product is to boost the signal strength for devices farther away from the router, and this product does not do that. OK, it is a cheap device compared to others, so I'm returning this one and will try a different brand.

  Due to Covid, had to relocate my computer at home. No longer on the same floor as the router so I had to switch from hard wired to the router to a wireless connection. I am in I.T. and spend a good portion of my week on video conferences and use remote resources via VPN...SQL, SharePoint, HelpDesk, File Shares etc. Cannot tell I am on wireless. Was nervous at first, but glad I bought this instead of running cable. Had it set up in 10 seconds. Literally plug it in, push the WPS on the router, push the WPS on the Extender and BAM! all hooked up. Plugged a switch into the extender and 3 computers into the switch. ( We moved all the computers to the basement 'Office', My work Computer, My Personal and my wife's personal PC. All up and running with no slow downs.

    Check your dual band WiFi router first, you may not need this.
  
",5.0 ,Erin,"Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2019","









  
  
    
  If you have a dual band 2.4 and 5 GHz WiFi router you may find yourself at the threshold between the range of 2.4 and 5 GHz which will cause your device to either switch back and forth or hang on to a poor 5 GHz signal rather than switch to a stronger 2.4 GHz signal.  I didn’t figure all of this out until after I purchased this device only to find it didn’t fix my issue.  My devices continued to hang on to the weak 5GHz even over the strong 2.4 GHz being broadcast by this range extender.  Disabling 5 GHz on the original router was really all I needed.I will say this is an excellent value if you really need it.  It was easy to setup and is easy to manage. The range is good too.  Though I don’t really need it, I’ll keep the extender installed in the bedroom to maximize performance.

  This device is limited in its ability, but it is priced accordingly. Be sure you understand what it can and can't do before buying - you may need a different model.It advertises up to 800 square feet of coverage. I didn't do the math before I bought it, so I ended up having to relocate it in order to accomplish my needs. Fortunately, I was able to find a suitable location.For those who don't feel like doing the math, I'll share it here. Since we're talking radio waves, a circle is the most accurate measurement. 800 square feet is a circle with a diameter of roughly 32 feet. Sounds good until you realize that the device is the center of the circle. Translation - you can get a usable signal up to 16 feet from the unit in any direction. Farther away than that, don't expect a reliable connection.It will also cost you some speed. I lose about 30% measured 5 feet away compared to my native Wifi signal at the same location. This is the reason for 4 stars instead of 5. Otherwise, it does exactly what it says it will do.I needed it to give the security camera at the opposite end of the house from my router (50+ feet) a reliable network connection, and for this it is perfect.

    Absolutely Awful -- Worse Connection With It Than Without It
  
",1.0 ,Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2019","









  
  
    
  The positive reviews here blow me away because this extender absolutely sucks. First, it has virtually no range when it comes to the 5.0 connection (as opposed to the 2.4), and  will not connect to the Internet using the 5.0 band at all, even though it shows that it's connected to the router. Second, it actually creates a poorer connection than I was getting without it. I have a TV with a Roku stick in my upstairs media room (my router is downstairs on the other side of the house), and when I don't use this extender, I get a ""fair"" Roku connection, which works, and with the extender, I get a ""poor"" connection. Moreover, the advertising for the product is misleading because the supposed ultra-fast mode doesn't work at all. I've wasted 7 hours of my life today trying to get the thing to work in an acceptable fashion, and it will not. Moreover, the ""reset"" button doesn't completely reset the unit once it's been configured, so that you can attempt to configure things better. I am returning mine pronto, and good riddance. I will try a different model.

  I bought this wifi extender hoping to boost my wifi signal so I would have better performance in my home office.  I have had ongoing problems with the signal dropping, but blamed my Internet rather than this device.  I have had to reset the extender multiple times, which is a pain in the patootie.  I recently upgraded my modem and router, but still had issues with the signal dropping.  It wasn't until I had another family member connecting directly to my wifi (with no issues) at the same time that I was going through the extender (with ongoing problems) that I realized the problem was with the extender's inability to maintain a connection with my home's wifi network.

  UPDATE:  Product DOES WORK NOW AND WELL.  Seem the error was due to ""Purchasers"" incorrect set up.  LOL.  My mistake even stumped customer service.  Anyways, setup is complete and I am pleased to report that the blue signal light is constant.  Reason for the 4 stars is I haven't tried to distance for the signal range yet.  But all in all, worth the money.  Sorry TP Link.I purchased 3 of the extenders. Two for gifts and one or me.  I am waiting to see if the other two work before sending mine and/or the others back.  I went online and chatted for information on setting up the extender since, I could not do so by the instructions that were provided in the package.  I also called twice and spoke directly with techs that ""tried"" to help me install.  After, over an  hour of technical support via telephone, I decided that I would post this review.  Customer service was quick to respond to my call but after many attempts could not resolve the issue.  It appears that during the initial setup, I was not able to create a password to finish the setup process.  What appeared was a ""sign in"" page for a password that had already been established.  Unable to resolve after many attempts, I think it was in my best interest to return the item.  As I stated before, I will wait to see the other two extenders I purchased have the same issue before deciding to them as well.  I gave 2 stars because of the courteous customer service persons.

  I’m very disappointed in this product. I was so happy with how easy it was to set up with WPS function, however the delight ended there. Product worked okay for a few hours then my tv and phone both lost internet connection. They were both still connected to the extension but the extension had no internet signal. I have moved the device to every available outlet even though the device gave me no indication of needing to be moved (there’s a red light for that) and that never helped. Second day using device I had to hard reset it and set it up again. Device seemed to work for a while again until the signal was lost. So I moved it once more. After many tests, downloading the app, attempting to update firmware (device was already updated to latest) the connection finally came back...for a while, only to drop out again. Basically I’m tired of the amount of work it takes to get this “effortless” device to work consistently so I’m going to have to return and go for another brand.

Did I mention that we are an internet heavy home?  I don't understand why such an extreme difference, especially when 5 other people and a myriad of devices are using the primary connection and I'm the only one using this one.

The WiFi reaches but on a 200 mps speed (we tested the speed upstairs) I was seeing 1 mbps (while everyone was asleep).I used the TP Link app and had this thing set up in under 5 mins.  Now my speed is up to 18 (with everyone awake and multiple devices connected).  For the price this little device packs a punch and I couldn’t be more excited.  My phone actually works and I can actually game without a fight for internet.  I paid less than 20$ and it was so worth it.**Edit.  That speed test was connected to the ORIGINAL WIFI.  I actually had slower speeds when connected to the extended WiFi, but the strength was 100% versus 84%.  I might play with the location of the extender a bit to see if I can’t get the speeds up more.

  With a slowish (15mbps) broadband speed, this range extender worked great for the age old 802.11N standard that my also cheap TP-link router worked with. Using it with another TP-link router and keeping the SSID the same as the host seemed to offer the best speeds/consistency for the phones in my household.Buyer beware: This uses the old N standard (soon to be called WIFI 4), the 5th generation standard (AC), is soon to be obsolete to the newest wifi 6/AX standard. Before buying something like this, you may want to look into simply buying a new router to try fixing your problems.

  This does make it possible for me to get wifi in more parts of my home, but it has incredibly low bandwidth and so has been virtually useless for me. My current top speed from my router is 450 mbps, but even if I put it in this extender in the same room as my router and connect to it with a computer in that room, the top download speed is around 10-15 mbps. When I move the extender slightly further away so that I can use it to get wifi in other parts of my home, the download speed can drop to 3-5 mbps.

  After reading reviews about this WiFi repeater, I'm so glad I decided to purchase it. It performs as advertised and holds up to the high standard that I'm used to from TP-Link products. All the necessary instructions are included with the product, and setup was a breeze.  I set up directly from my router's gateway rather than the app. The product itself is roughly palm-sized, and is designed thoughtfully to not cover up the outlet above it when plugged in.I live in an old row house in a crowded neighborhood, so between other WiFi signals around me and physical barriers of various materials, there was a ton of interference between my router in the living room and my office in the back of the house. This little repeater is set up about halfway between the two and I've gone from laggy, pixelated video calls to perfect clarity.

  Very useful and fast. The default configuration and placement I used initially did not help as much as I would have liked but thanks to the options for splitting the bands 2.4 Ghz and 5 Ghz bands and some playing around with the location, I now get the speed on mobile devices I am paying my ISP for. The only issue that prevents me from giving it 5 stars is that the advanced options instructions were a little confusing even for a nerd so it may take some trial and error.NOTE: I use an Apple Airport as my main WiFi router and this worked perfectly with it and had no issues. If you are somewhat technically included, just follow the directions to fill in the ""dark"" spots in your WiFi coverage. Excellent price for what it has done for our household.

  Product looks nice, the app is nice and easy to use.  I have tried all three connection options (pushing WPS button on my home router, via the iPhone app, and also through the browser on my laptop).  The extender does not connect to my home router at all.  Everything works, but it will not connect.  Frustrating as I am doing everything according to the directions, plus I have owned two extenders prior to this one.  Also, the video has some slightly different directions than the direction on the app and the paper that comes with the box.  For example, you need to set a password for the extender itself when setting up via the app.  The password MUST be the same password as your home router's password.  The paper directions and app directions mention none of this.  But it mentions on the video.  I am not sure why companies are not consistent with their operating procedures, but this is an example of one.  I am writing this after I have purchased a different extender (other than TP-Link) and it took 3 minutes to set up and is working just fine.  Sometimes you have to learn the hard way I guess.

For example, if your home WiFi network is called HOMEWiFi, the extender creates HOMEWiFi.ext. Then you can dedicate specific devices to just that extension.

  To start, you need to install an app or use WPS to connect to network. Another route they dont mention in the manual is to connect it with an ethernet cable to a router, find an IP and log into the extender by IP. Most higher end extenders allow you to connect ethernet to your computer and connect by default http. After that the setup was easy.Wanted to use it as a bridge. It works well for watching youtube videos on 2 computers but is not good for upstreaming. It can't steadily support one HD surveillance camera. The signal strength is good but lots of missing frames and it drops connection every 5-10 mins connection, in my case its over 10 second timeouts.Seems it does some kind of MAC masking so if you have managed network with static/manual IPs expect collisions and inconsistencies.And lastly, it gets really hot.So if you are looking to extend your ""Karen_Home_WiFi"" then you have a winner, otherwise get a better one

  Overview:I've never used a wifi extender before and wanted to first see how they worked without breaking the bank on some $50 gizmo. $20 seemed like a fair amount to do a trial run on.The Problem:My wifi covers my house fairly, but the house was built in the 50's and has plaster walls, so sometimes the signal sucks in the furthest parts of the house. Backyard? Forget it, barely any service, and super choppy.Hypothesis:I wanted an extender that was discreet, that I could put at the edge of the house that would extend the wifi coverage completely throughout the backyard.Results:$20 WELL SPENT! Super easy to setup. (I downloaded the app and just went through setup, 4mins in and out). I installed it at the furthest edge of the house and BOOM. Now not only do I have full coverage throughout  the backyard but I also have a strong signal anytime my main wifi drops out inside the house.CONS:the only con is that it doesnt have 5ghz coverage. It's using your 2ghz signal. BUT, I dont think most people utilize 5ghz anyway to be honest. Most every device you use, uses 2ghz so unless your a super techy person it shouldn't bother you.FINAL THOUGHTS:Tots recommend it. Granted it's the  first day, so i'll have to see how long the product lasts, but sooo farrr sooooo goooood.

I got this wifi extender because the only time anyone could get wifi is if you were home alone or no one else was using. The wifi only reached the living room. I bought this and put it in one of the hallways where wifi does not reach and let me tell you it’s amazing. It was an easy install literally took probably less than 5 minutes. One thing that I felt like i didn’t read or I just missed it that I would recommend us getting the app in your phone that comes with this device. You can shut it off to minimize electricity use and control how wide the range it. Also be able to tell how strong the signal is.

  I got this for my parents place because they have their wifi router on one side of their house and garage is on the other side and my dad wants to put up some outdoor cameras.  The ROUTER signal is very fringe outside by the garage, about mid 70's decibels.  I tried to put the extender in the middle of the house and the router signal was stronger than the extender signal on the close side of the garage.  So I moved the extender to the wall that is on the opposite is side of the house of the router and 15 feet away from the near side of the garage.  The near side of the garage then got about 10 decibels better with the extender than the router.  Then when I went to the far side of the garage and tested that, the router had slightly better signal than the extender.  So bottom line is it can boost the signal, but not far, it's range is very weak.  It'd probably be good for an outdoor patio area that has weak signal and you can plug the extender into the wall that's right inside the area you are trying to boost.

  We recently switched over to AT&T internet and I am very unhappy with them and their service. My husband is pretty mad too as he can’t use his xbox on the other side of the house. They were supposed to give us an air tie which is just their brand extender. After being promised one they tried to tell me I had to pay $50 for it and wait a week to have an installer bring it to us. After a few curse words and hanging up I bought this instead. Much cheaper and came in 2 days with my prime. It was super easy to connect. Works really good in our living room with nearly all of our devices. My husband still has a few issues on ocassion with his xbox but he’s also comparing it to when it was hard wired with our last internet provider so I can’t be sure. Overall I’m super happy with this and glad it worked so I can still tell AT&T to screw themselves lol.

  After about 4 hours of debugging, my conclusion was that it's DHCP was broken. I could connect to the internet if I self-assigned an IP on my computer but not with auto-assigned IPs. About 80% of the time it would assign a 169.254.x.x address, which according to support means that it failed. The rest of the time it would assign 192.168.0.x where x was always >100 for some reason, but internet wouldn't work. I spent 2 hours with tech support on chat and the only suggestion I got was to try rebooting it and my router, which I'd already done. They said the escalated the issue and contacted me by email to say I'd get further support within 1 business day, but 3 business days went by. I don't want to spend any more time with this product or brand, so I returned it and bought a Netgear

  I ordered two of these. I was ""hoping"" the second unit would go through the first unit to create a longer distance. This did NOT work for me. From what I can see, each extension unit has to have its own path back to the original wireless modem and not through another extender in order to work. You make make a wifi triangle or wifi modem in the middle then go left and right from there but it won't go dot to dot into the distance ( second unit past the first unit ). Also the simple button push for enrollment did not work for me. I had to use the computer browser enrollment instructions to get it to work.  Also note that if I'm downstairs I have to tell my devices to look at the extender and not the upstairs wifi signal. So if you're existing wifi name might be "" ABCDEFG "", you will see the extender as "" ABCDEFG-EXT "" on your available wifi connections list. Also the tech support person I spoke to must be in  Mumbai, India. I could not understand her at all. So be prepared to fight with this on your own if you get stuck. But now it works fine once I got it figured out.

  I bought this to extend wifi into my backyard from an upstairs window.

Not only that but it seems to have strengthened my my regular Ubiquity wifi network inside my house, an unexpected bonus.Setup:  it took me 3 tries to get it past the red setup LED.  First, DO NOT use your smartphone for setup, as clever as it seems.  That just didn't work.  Second attempt was from my Windows laptop, which turned had its own wifi issues, so no go that time.  After resetting the TP-Link, the third attempt was on an iMac desktop, and it went very smoothly, just following on screen directions took under 5 minutes.  Unplugged the device and moved it to the back of the house, plugged into the end of an extension cord, placed in window sill, and BAM! dream of backyard wifi realized.  For $18 bucks?

  This is probably the simplest install I’ve had in a long while. Device arrived on time, simply pressed WPS button on router, then button on device and moved it to the edge of solid signal and it has easily doubled the range of strong WiFi signal.This was for my garage to have good signal for a smart switch AC and a Nest Protect smoke detector as I wouldn’t be able to hear a beeping but that app alerts my phone. I used to have one bar of WiFi and even then i would get better speeds if I turned it off instead, and now I have full bars on my WiFi signal while out in my shop. Great product for the price!

  So I was hoping this would solve my wifi issues downstairs in the basement.  The router sits on the upstairs opposite side of the house.  Using the app and connecting it was easy.  It mimics your router SSID and adds '_EXT' to it.I think the limitations of the single band showed.  It struggled with pulling 11mbps down and 2 up.  I do Skype calls for work and it was really choppy.On the flip side I bought a power line adapter and then hooked that up to the extender and changed it to an access point and now it gets 16/5 really solidly.  I think the communication to and from the router and back out on the same band causes a lot of lag so losing that first leg of travel helps a ton.If I had to do it over I would have opted for the $10 more dual band model.  As it is now it's fine for my son to use for his remote learning.

  I was in the beginning a bit skeptical about this product. In all honest truth, I purchased it because it was being sold in an Amazon Deal. I've been having issues of slow connectivity in my basement. My router is in the main floor and although I am able to connect from the basement, the connection isn't what you can call reliable. I used the WPS method of connecting to the router (mainly because I didn’t want to create “ANOTHER” username-password account with TP) and it worked like magic. I was having some issues at first but it was because my router wasn’t setup to accept WPS connections. I was unaware of that until I logged into the router. My suggestion is to ensure that the WPS tool is enabled in your router before you try setting up the extender. Once I had the extender connected and after was moved to basement I was amazed at the speed and quality of the connection. It prompted me to write a review. :-)

  This is a rather popular and highly rated device on Amazon. That's why I chose it. I have noticed NO IMPROVEMENT other than constantly needing to RECONNECT the darn thing to my router. One would think it would always sync back up to my home's WiFi after an initial sync. But every time you look at the lights, there's a RED one on. Also, a suggestion for the manufacturer: Use green/red for the connection and another light (blue) for the Power. Currently, it's red/blue and power is blue too; so, from a distance, a quick glance at the device is not useful. I have to go right up to the unit an see what's happening. Regardless, when it's hooked (blue blue) it doesn't seem to be effective for us.

  I had two very specific objectives when shopping for a range extender - I wanted to get the necessary ""three bars"" for WiFi on my Blink XT2 camera, and I wanted to spend as little money as possible.  This little device has accomplished both objectives.We have dual-band gigabyte WiFi service in our home, but getting an adequate 2.4 GHz signal from our second floor router to just outside our front door had been a bit of a challenge.  After using this product for a few weeks, I am quite happy with it.  It does what it is supposed to - extending the range of our system for the camera.  It isn't particularly fast, compared to closer, more direct 5GHz and 2.4GHz connections with our router, but I am satisfied and happy.  If your needs are greater or different than mine, there are more powerful, higher end alternatives out there from TP-Link and others.My Blink camera is working fine again.  There have been no stability problems with the extender so far, and it was a snap to install with the WPS button.

  Goal was to extend wifi to garage to listen to internet radio/music. Thought that should be easy. Extender would not connect to home network using Netgear router. Followed directions to push wps and extender button to connect. Led light on extender indicates no connection however it completely removed and replaced our home network with its own. This left us with no internet connection. Once internet connection was reestablished - attempted again to use alternate directions but gave up out of frustration.

  it is only a 2.4ghz band which if you don't know the 2.4 is range and a 5ghz is for speed. My samsung tv usually disconnects from the internet the next day and its a pain to enter the pass. So I use this extender downstairs with a ethernet cable connecting the tv with this extender to keep it connect to the tv. While the modern is upstairs usually downstairs has slowing connection speeds. So, I can also connect to the extender that is downstairs with my devices to get the best internet.  Pretty good device to extend the internet range. If you want to extend for gaming get a dual 5ghz and connect it with an ethernet cable with your pc and it should work if the internet connection isn't reaching that far.

  I already owned one of these and my son had a horrible time getting it connected, but once he did, it has worked well. I could not get this one to connect either, I spent hours trying everything in the QUICK SET-UP.  I used the online chat and learned the unit sent did not have current firmware loaded.  I got new firmware emailed to me which I had to download and load.  I spoke with the phone support person for over 1 1/2 hours.  He finally said my product was defective and needed to be returned.  He sent me to a website to make a warranty account, which would tell me where to send it to, but first it required I contact technical support again (4th time).  Customer Service is not their strong point.They called and emailed me the following day after writing this review.  They escalated this issue and this Tech walked me through the set-up without any issues.  I didn't have to download anything or go through all the steps the first person did. It is up and running.  I'm happy to have it working. The second Tech (Ed) was friendly and knowledgeable.

  For setup, I don't have the specific button on my Belkin router so I had to resort to the second option of using the app. After signing in the app, the process was pretty much automatic by following the steps. I believe I have seen stronger wifi signal and my Skype conversation appeared more fluid after installing the extender. I have my wifi router upstairs and it seems to be improving my situation in my dining room temp office. I am cautiously optimistic.

    Just What I Needed For Better Reception
  
",5.0 ,Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  I live in a 2000 sq. ft. condo with two bedrooms separated by the kitchen and living room. With my router in one of the bedrooms, the second bedroom's reception was very poor. Connections were slow and sometimes they would drop off. The TP Link connector was offered by Amazon at a good price with mostly good recommendations, so I got it. My master bedroom's reception went from very poor to good - excellent. My connections are quicker and no more dropped internet connection.I found the easiest way to install it was with their app loaded to my iPhone. The process is almost identical to installing an Echo device.  We live in a well constructed building with solid wood doors and insulation between interior walls. If it works for me, it should for you.

    It just works!
  
",5.0 ,Matt,"Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2016","









  
  
    
  After many failed attempts at a DIY range extender with DD-WRT, I decided to pick one of these up. I figured for the price, it would be worth having a ""Wife approved"" solution. This was by far the easiest extender setup I've ever experienced. I've become quite a fan of TP-Link. There's really not too much to this thing once you get it setup the first time. After that, it just works. I've had months of up-time, and by the time you would have a problem, you've probably power-cycled due to your crappy ISP anyway.I believe there is one model below this one, but I purchased this one because it best matched the specifications of my router, the TP-Link TL-WDR4300.One of my favorite features is the ethernet port on the bottom of the unit. What a brilliant idea. I didn't think I would use it, but now that I have it, I use it constantly. I have this down by my TV connected to a switch to bring Internet to my Blu-Ray, XBox, and MythTV DVR. I highly recommend this product if you're in a situation like mine.

    HAD TO RETURN IT
  
",2.0 ,TonyM,"Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this item because I live in a 2-story house and my router is downstairs right in the center of our place. My ISP is Xfinity and Im using a ""MOTOROLA MG7315 8x4 Cable Modem Plus N450 Single Band Wi-Fi Gigabit Router with Power Boost, 343 Mbps Maximum DOCSIS 3.0"" that I bought off Amazon. This past week the WiFi has been HORRIBLE upstairs, I pay for a 100 MBPS plan and am getting about 10-15MBPS upstairs in my room. So, I bought this in hopes that it would strengthen the signal upstairs and at least give me some boost since I'm working from home.NOPE. I installed it (which was SUPER EASY) and had it working within 2 mins. However, with my laptop next to the router I was pulling 50-70MBPS straight from my regular router. I switch over to this extender (It creates a network with your home wifi's name and adds ""-plus"" to the name)...My download speeds across three individual tests on 3 different laptops were 4-8MBPS NEXT TO MY HOME ROUTER. Upstairs it wouldn't go above 5MBPS....So now im returning it.

    FINALLY! WIFI everywhere!

  This is by far the best WIFI extender I have ever used. I have a multi level house and wifi is challenging. Full signal in some parts of the house and in others,..there is none. I have tried MANY MANY wifi units similar to this. I'm very tech savvy and pride myself in figuring stuff out with out directions. However, that is very different with some wifi extenders. They are complicated to set up and do not work good at all. I had good luck with the TP-Link light sockets with the echo and setup was a breeze. So I decided to take one more shot at yet another wifi extender. Choosing the TP-Link in hopes it would work just as good. I really don't understand these other reviews that state how hard it is to set up. This wifi extender is truly easy to set up. This is what i did,....Quick instructions right on the side of the box. Plug in the TP-Link, close to your router, the green light flashes, press the WPS button on your router, then press the signal button on the extender. The green light flashes, goes solid green, goes solid red then after 5-10 seconds the light stays solid green. The unit is now paired with your router. Now, Unplug the extender, walk to a midway point in your house close to the dead spot and plug it back in. It will blink green again, then solid green, then solid red, 5-10 seconds it turns solid green. Open any device you want to use for wifi, go to wifi settings and find your wifi name. Except the word _EXT will be after the device name. So if your normal wifi is GOOBER616 for example. It would now show as GOOBER616_EXT, Choose the Ext one and enter your normal password for wifi, and BOOM, FULL wifi signal. I now have wifi in every room in the house. If you plug the unit in and the light stays on solid yellow? Then move it to another socket closer to the router. Hope this helps anyone who has or has had a problem.

    and this one seemed great for the price

  I don't typically write Amazon reviews, but I feel this warrants one. My modem and router are kept downstairs, and my upstairs study is an almost complete dead zone, I'm lucky to get above 1-4 Mbps, while other rooms get 20-25 Mbps. I researched wifi range extenders, and this one seemed great for the price. It arrived a day earlier than planned, and after 5 minutes pairing it with my network, it was plugged in and working perfectly. My computers now average about 22-24 Mbps in my study, which has a huge effect on my productivity and general enthusiasm for life. A few notes:It does not have a cord, it plugs directly into an outlet like a nightlightIt automatically creates a new network named yournetwork + ""_EXT""It's smaller than I thought, about the size of 3 stacked packs of post-it notesIf you use your internet everyday for school or work, slow speeds speeds can be detrimental. This completely fixed the issue for me. The most $20 has every improved my life. Other more expensive models probably have some features this doesn't, but if you just want to fix dead zones for not much money, this is the answer.

  Oh man, I am over the moon about this product. My bedroom is the basement of the house, so the wifi just barely reached, and has a very weak signal. This extender is a life saver.It took maybe 2 minutes to set up, the hardest part was getting it out of the box! It amplifies the signal perfectly, and I find that it actually makes my wifi faster, as less people are using it!HouseWifi is my normal wifi signal in my room and the HouseWifi_EXT is the extenders wifi signal in my room. Look at the difference!I will be convincing my family to buy these for the farther parts of the house. In love!!

    Works with Ring Doorbell
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Rachie Poo,2018年7月30日 在美国审核,"









  
  
    
  I needed a WiFi extended to provide a better Wifi signal to my Ring Doorbell. Unfortunately, the location of my router was too far from the Ring and the signal had to travel through too many walls, including the external brick wall. Because of the weak signal, I was having trouble answering rings and getting live views on my phone.I originally looked into purchasing the Ring brand Wifi extended, but it was 50 bucks and it was ONLY for Ring products. I thought it would help to have a Wifi extender to connect to all my other devices, so I scoured Amazon to find a cheaper one.I am technologically literate in many areas, but connectivity and networks are NOT one of those areas. I was concerned that I would have to hire a techy person to come help me, but surprisingly, it was very easy to set up and connect with my current AT&T Uverse router.I did run into a bit of a problem, as my Ring Doorbell was still showing a weak signal. I fiddled around with the Ring and realized that this extended had created a new network for me to connect to - it was my network name with ""-EXT"" at the end. I reconnected the Ring to THAT network - my password was the same and everything - and NOW my Ring Doorbell works PERFECT!This extender is great and does exactly what I need.I also noticed on the box that there is a phone number to call for 24/7 tech support, which is very handy to have!I highly recommend it if you just need a boost in signal to reach certain devices or reach devices that are too far away from your router.

  I live in a large apartment, the modem is in my bedroom and the signal in the living room is strong enough to be reliable so use an extender.  When the one I have had for a few years died, I ordered this one to take its place.  There were many to choose from, but I chose this one because TP-LINK is a brand I trust.The extender was easy to install  and was soon up and running.  I now have a very strong signal in the living room and throughout the apartment.Based on my  experience, I recommend this extender.

  The extender DOES NOT keep me connected to the network.  Every time I turn on my LG Smart TV, there's no connection, or I get an error message stating the password is incorrect.  I then have to unplug the extender, restart the router, then plug the extender back in for it to connect again.  EVERY DAY I have to do this.  First, I thought it was the TV -called LG customer service and completed the instructions they gave, but the problem continued. I later realized it was the extender and not the TV.  Now I'm purchasing a Netgear - I pray works better than this one.

  All I can say is WOW! I live in up in the hills of Kentucky in a Holler so my other houses our not right next door they are a good 1/10 of a mile away at least. My father lives under me and he uses my internet connection on wifi and he does not get a good connection maybe 1-2 bars. So when he got an amazon fire tv which we use for Playstation Vue, Netflix, and Hulu he would be able to watch but it would stop here and there because of the low signal strength. We decided to try this out and see if it would solve the problem and it did not only could I see my modem at full strength but I could see three other modems two of them at full strength and one at 60-80% went up and down. To let you know one house close to me is 1/10 a mile the one that is farthest is 1/4 a mile and at 1/4 a mile I still got a 60-80% signal from them. If you want to extend your range I would recommend this product it is amazing.

  There is a problem with my TP Link N300 Range Extender. It constantly disconnects from my main router and kicks all the devices connected to it off as well. Every day I have to unplug the range extender and plug it back into the outlet for it to work again, but this problem occurs every day so it's not a permanent fix. I hope I didn't get a defective unit.
