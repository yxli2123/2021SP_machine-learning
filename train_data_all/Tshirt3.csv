  I generally wouldn't bother writing a review for plain, white T-shirts but I was pleasantly surprised that these were a bit thicker and nicer material than I was expecting.  We have other versions of this T-shirt bought at a box store and the material isn't the same.  So here I am writing a review for plain, white T-shirts.  These are nice.  Not sure why they would be different, but they are.

",5.0,Philip from Minneapolis,"Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2021","









  
  
    
  The last few years, I've been disappointed with the Hanes t-shirts I bought--apparently, due to increased price of cotton--so they thinned down the fabric; and also painted the label on (what the heck is wrong with a standard label?  It shows me instantly which side of the t-shirt I have).  But these latest t-shirts are great, thicker fabric, fits fine, regular old label again.

    Super weird fit
  
",1.0,Alex W.,"Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2018","









  
  
    
  Super weird fit. I bought these for the gym and I got XL so I can reach above head without uncovering my out of shape belly. Well if you're looking for a square fit with arms that are cut way too low and taper weird, then you might like these. The sleeves start so low on the side and taper in a way that makes all this extra material bunch up under my arm. Right in the sweaty part. It's bizarre. Also, they are square after they shrink. Def not long enough for how wide they are. Not to mention that as soon as I start to sweat, they get all saggy and look terrible. I don't write reviews that often, but these were so bad, I felt compelled to.

    Decent, cheap cotton shirts, but nothing special
  
",3.0,pen_name,"Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2021","









  
  
    
  Not the original ComfortSoft line, but still good 100% cotton shirts. Made in Haiti. Tear-away tag is a non-issue, despite former shirts being tagless. They do attract some lint, but nothing substantial. There is nothing wrong with them, especially considering the price. They appear to be genuine Hanes - I found them here after seeing stores near me no longer carried them. Perhaps this is why.

  My husband needed black undershirts and they're cheaper online than in stores. My husband always wears Hanes white undershirts.The only problem with these shirts is they're really thick.  I would want my undershirt to be thinner since it's an UNDERSHIRT.  I didn't want layers to keep my husband balmy at work.  Other than that, they're fine.

    Layers with style
  
",5.0,Robert G. Leroe,"Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2021","









  
  
    
  Here in New England, wearing layers of clothing is essential, but white t-shirts stand out and (in my opinion) look unsightly under an open-necked shirt.  These shirts by Haynes are perfect: they fit good, give extra warmth, and look terrific.  They are a deep, rich, stylish dark grey which go nicely with every color.  They complement what you're wearing.  There's a tag in the back which doesn't bother me in the least, but I hear some people don't like tags.  I really don't see how you could go wrong with these t-shirts; they're ideal.

  The shirts are very durable and fit great. I am about 5’9 170lbs and they fit perfect. Not too tight or too loose. I wouldn’t say they are “really soft” they have a more durable feel. Most shirts that are really soft usually feel cheaply made. These do not. Definitely recommend if you are just looking for a simple black shirt.

The quality is bad and just gets worse with each wear and wash, but given how price, I feel I can't really complain. Just know what you are getting into with the price, something that will last for a short/quick fix, but shouldn't be sought as a long time fix to a work shirt issue.

    Good T-shirts, lesson learned
  
",4.0,Ron G,"Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  Update:  I learned a valuable lesson from my first purchase.  If the t-shirts are 100% cotton, you should go up one size.  They are going to shrink down a size in the dryer even at the lowest setting.  I had to get rid of all my 100% cotton mediums and buy a large.  If the shirts are a cotton-poly mix, they won’t shrink as much and you’ll probably be ok with your regular size.  I hope this info helps. I like Hanes t-shirts in general and decided to give these a shot.  No name packaging was a little suspect, but the t-shirts appeared to be decent quality, not too thin or too thick.  I wash all my tees and underwear first before wearing.  What I’ve learned over the years is not to machine dry these t-shirts if you want them to maintain their shape and especially length.  I wash them, gently pull them length wise and hang dry them.  Works like a charm.  If you must dry them, you must use the lowest possible setting which I believe the delicate option and not for too long either.  Hope that info helps.

  The shirts will work but they are scratchy even after 5 or 6 washings.  I know for sure what Haines T's are supposed to be like and these aren't them.  You can tell right away by the very lightly printed inside brand stamp that something is wrong.  Perhaps you will get the proper product when you order, but check when they arrive and return if not right.

  Last year I bought 3 of these T's at a local merchant, size L and they fit perfectly, exactly the way I like them.  When I saw them at Amazon at a good price, I decided to buy this 4 pack.  Though the description of the product and the label on the product are exactly the same as what I purchased last year, the fit is entirely different.  The latest T's are too big, too long, sleeves are longer, a much less athletic looking fit, which is what I really like about the ones I got last year.  So, I'm not very satisfied with this product and will probably relegate them to the hanging around the house but never wearing out set of T's I have.  I'd return them, but I washed them in hot water hoping they'd shrink up, but they didn't, not enough anyway.  I generally like Hanes products, but the sizing inconsistency is a pain.  I'd rather spend more and get something I can be sure of.  Will not buy this brand again.

  I purchased these because I could no longer find them at the store where I first purchased them. The shirts I purchased(about a year ago) were soft and had some weight to them. Additionally, they fit great. This morning I put on my fist one from the new package and knew immediately that something was different. The shirt is much thinner and isn't as soft. And, you guessed it, it didn't fit as well. So, I'm thinking that either these are poor quality knock offs(If so, Amazon should take note) or Hanes just decided to put profits in front of customer satisfaction and give us a lesser quality item, in which case Hanes loses a customer forever. Either way, I'm pretty disappointed. Buyer Beware.

  If you are like me, you probably grab a three pack of tee shirts when you are shopping at a Walmart. For years those tees were reliable and cheap. They fit the bill. Well, have you seen them lately? What on earth has happened to the quality of tee shirts? They have become so thin and they shrink after the first wash. That disappointment led me to the Hanes Men's ComfortSoft Short Sleeve T-Shirt. These Hanes tees are a good mid-weight cotton and they did not shrink after washing. The color selection is fabulous and to my surprise, the dark grey tees I purchased did not fade too badly. After the fourth wash they are still quite vibrant.  This is probably more than you need to know about me and tee shirts, but I was so pleased to find good quality shirts again that I wanted to share.

  The problem is that although this is marked a comfort t shirt, it's the ""Heavyweight"" version, which is more of a ruff material and the sleeve circumference is larger. The Comfort t that I ordered several weeks before this was what I was expecting, they are soft and fit better IMO. This review is for the ones ordered from, ""Under Moments"" and the soft comfortable ones were ordered from, ""Wonder Discounts"". Both are advertised as the same exact shirt and are both Prime eligible. I kept them because they were on sale.

  I typically wear a 2X shirt as I am 6'3"" and have a couple extra pounds.  I ordered these as shirts to wear around the house or doing yard work.  They are even a bit larger than I expected, but not in length. The length was very disappointing. It seems like shirt manufacturers don't take length into consideration.  While a bit disappointing, they will still serve much of their intended ""casual around the house"" purposes.

  I really like the Hanes ComfortSoft t-shirts I bought at local retailers.  They're 100% cotton, very thin and lightweight and perfect for wearing and working in a hot climate.  Since local stores are often out of stock,  I ordered these from Amazon, and received two packages of tees that have a red Hanes tag (my others were always tagless), and no description of the materials used or any style name.  Just ""Hanes"" and made in El Salvador.  They're thicker than I wanted, but most importantly, they're cut tight and obviously have a lot of spandex in them.  They're stretchy and clingy.  Really uncomfortable.  Not at all what I ordered.

  I bought a set of these shirts for daily use at home and also for the gym.  These shirts are very comfortable, I usually use them after taking a shower at night and wear them while sleeping.  It feels smooth to the skin making sleep more comfortable.  Then in the morning, I will still use them for the gym, it's cool and sweat absorbent, then toss then to the laundry after workouts.  Since I got the dark colored ones, washing them are so easy, as no need to bleach.  The size fits exactly, I use XL size from Nike, adidas, and under armor.  If you want a simple no print shirt for everyday use, these shirts are highly recommendable.

But, sadly, and to my disappointment, there was no way he was wearing them anywhere except under sweatshirts and hoodies. They are so thin they are see through. The collar stretched out after a couple of washes, so he couldn't wear them under the right button down. The hem on the sleeves and at the waist was crooked and the seams were poorly sewn. No joke, it's that bad. I've always gotten Hanes for my boys but we're going with Jockey now, or something else...I hate to even think of him wearing those t-shirts at all, even under his hoodies. I want him to toss them. Forget even giving them to Goodwill or Jesus's House, that would be terrible. However, one redeeming factor, they were delivered pronto via Prime...

  These t-shirts are rather lightweight, but they are very comfortable and work well for me as an undershirt, or as an alternative to going topless while working out. Because they are so light, they dry quickly. Speaking of which, they will shrink substantially as others have noted, so I recommend washing them in cold water and keeping an eye on them in the dryer.One other thing is that the Washed Heather Gray picture above depicts a pocket t-shirt - this in not the case. They are a light gray with no pocket and somewhat different from the black. I believe the black is 100% cotton, while the gray is 75% cotton/25% polyester - this is probably why the black feels a little more comfortable to me.I only recently purchased both the black and gray and can't speak to their longevity, but and at around three bucks a shirt it's a pretty good deal.

  These shirts are not tagless.  I assumed they would be as most are now. Also, they were not in Hanes packaging.  I received four shirts folded into a  shipping bag.  They were to be part of a gift so I don’t know how they fit but they do not feel soft they have more of a scratchy feel and I will not be giving them to anyone.  The only reason I gave three stars is because I got what I ordered- four white shirts and they were shipped timely. Not good quality.

  Ok read all the negative stuff bought with skepticism but as luck would have it I am pleasantly surprised and the shirts are very comfortable and fit me great. I normally wear medium but lately mediums are not really the same as before so I washed the Large in Hot Water and had minimal shrinkage now a perfect fit just in between a Medium and A LARGE. I would say a cold wash there would probably be little to no shrinkage as I first washed in cold. They have tags which doesn't bother me but makes identification easier in my mishmesh stack of Black T Shirts. Over all very satisfied just ordered 4 more on Amazon Prime Wardrobe. Good Luck...

  I have worn Hanes ComfortSoft tees for years and these are not them. First off, these have tags and ComfortSoft are all tagless. The shirts are well made and of a good quality material, but they aren't the soft, combed cotton like material of a ComfortSoft shirt. They arrived in a clear plastic, unmarked bag (inside the Amazon shipping bag of course), with no indication on the bags or shirt tags that these are ComfortSoft. I wish they were softer, but I will keep them as they fit well and are of a sturdy material. I thought the price was too good to be true for ComfortSoft shirts, guess I was right.

  In June 2019, I bought a set of four white Hanes t shirts from this seller and was happy with them, so now in June 2020, I decided to order more in a different color.  The pretty colors are quite a bit more expensive and my needs are more for casual activities around the house or yard work or casual errands in the car, so was looking for colors comparable in price to the white t's and wound up ordering the light blue ones.  They seem pretty much the same, with the exception that the light blue shirts were made in Haiti and the white ones were made in the Dominican Republic.  Both are 100% cotton.  Both colors came with really cheap annoying plastic tags on the back of the neck.....the good news is that they are really easy just to tear or pull off.  I washed them in mild warm water in my washer and then dried them in a ""warm but not hot setting"" in the dryer and they shrunk about 4 or 5 inches in length and a couple inches around the waist and chest.  I am 5'9"" tall and weigh 210 lbs.  I bought XL and before washing, they came down to my mid thighs, maybe 9 or10 inches below my waist.....after washing and drying, they shrunk to around 4 to 5 inches below my waist.  All in all, they seem to fit my body type as well as to be expected.

I will say that this listing is very confusing with so many of the “same” shirt having so many variations. The black is tagless, the blue and charcoal have “tear off tags” (we will have to see how well that works!)

The neck collar is wide. I bought whit and charcoal. The charcoal ones have washing instructions printed inside the back and a stiff scratchy white tag. The White tees have two tags, very stiff and scratchy, one has Hanes on it and the other washing instructions. These are far too heavy for Hanes shirt. Knockoff copies.

    Charcoal heather fits true to size, because it's not 100% cotton
  
",5.0,Patrick Madigan,"Reviewed in the United States December 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  I went up a size, due to the many reviews suggesting this.  But the Charcoal Heather shirts are made of a cotton-poly blend, so they are true-to-size.  The shirts were huge when I got them, and after many washings they are still pretty big.  But they are holding up well.The info printed on the shirt is black-on-gray, so I can't determine if the cotton-poly blend is 90/10, 50/50, etc.  The shirts are comfy, just a bit scratchy.If I ordered them again, I would get then in 100% cotton (so it would be some other color), in which case going up a size would probably still be a good idea.

",1.0,stevens,"Reviewed in the United States September 23, 2018","









  
  
    
  I used to like Hanes brand in the past, but their quality is just under decline in the past few years. This T-Shirt is simply dreadful, and I should thought twice when I saw the price tag. For those who are looking for a comfort T-Shirt that does not ""scratch"" your skin, you should avoid Hanes in any possible way. The T-Shirt does not feel like 100% cotton at all... more like polyester. I compared that with all my other 100% cotton T-shirt, this one is just not feeling right at all.

  I got a pack of these grey hounds and let me tell ya, I like em! With Hanes you can’t go wrong with the soft quality. The shirts fit well and for a sweaty Betty like me it’s an extra plus that with their comfort comes breathability. I would recommend these for those summer walks or when you’re in need of an undershirt but don’t want to look like you just hopped out of the shower as a consequence. 10/10 shirts!

  Product is nothing like advertised or expected. Colors were supposed to be grey, navy, black and a green color....I received 2 black and 2 grey. Quality is also lacking. I buy Hanes tshirts for my husband regularly and although these came in Hanes packaging, they are coarse and stiff and the neckline is completely different. Don't bother.

    Poor Quality and Too Many Labels
  
",2.0,Boxersbear,"Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was really disappointed in these t-shirts. In the past I always considered Hanes to be a company that sold good quality underwear but I guess like everything else that's no longer true. The third time I wore one of these T-shirts a hole developed in the armpit area. Also I don't mind a label on the collar but this also has an annoying label on the side near the waist as well. Too much and definitely not necessary. I doubt I'll buy anymore clothing site unseen again.

  225lbs 5'11, fits me nice as a nice thick undershirt. I like to use these to exercise as it soaks up a lot of sweat. Protects my black shirts from the stains my antiperspirant gives when I wear them under my work shirts. Also an excellent value when I bought them, around $12. Best part is that the collar seems to be holding up. Usually undershirts stretch way out and wrinkle but these are looking fairly professional so far about a month in with heavy use + constant cleaning. I feel a slight wrinkle on the one I'm wearing now but it's still right on my neck which is what I want. Got to cover up my chest hair at all costs for a professional look!

  The reviews are unfortunately true. I read many reviews that the shirts didn't seem authentic since they came in a simple clear bag (with no brand logo, etc). I thought maybe those customers purchased from unauthorized sellers selling inauthentic items so I was 100% to purchase from the ""Amazon.com"" seller.My shirts still arrived in a simple clear plastic bag. No brand, no logo, nothing. (Picture 1).The shirts themselves are very thin. You can see right through them in picture 2. This picture has no zoom of any kind, just nothing but bright light on the other side. The shirts are also not ""super comfortable"".. they just feel like plain, old, regular tee shirts.. nothing extra soft or special about them.Lastly, the material content on the shirts are completely different than the Amazon listing. The listing showed ""100% cotton"", which is why I bought them. Unfortunately, the shirts are actually 50% cotton/50% polyester. (Last picture).If you want a regular, rough tee that is cheap, this is your shirt!! For those of you looking for something more substantial, this isn't the tee for you.

    Terrific price on 100% cotton T-shirts
  
",5.0,Abraham B,"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was apprehensive about buying these because they have the tag on them. But Hanes must use special thread because the tags don't scratch at all. I most appreciate that these T-shirts have NO POLYESTER or other synthetics in them. They're also a very thick, quality weave. Since I wear a T-shirt for one day before tossing it in the laundry, these have already gotten quite a few washes, dry-wrings, and (usually) line dries. They've held up very nicely. There's no piling yet--not even in the high-friction underarms region. And they're so comfortable I leave them on when I get home from work until bedtime.I didn't used to pay attention to the fabric mix of my T-shirts until, annoyed, I realized I kept having to replace them often. Sure enough, they were either mixed (poly/cotton) or even all poly. Never again.. Another benefit of pure cotton is it washes very easily and releases dirt quickly. Poly-mix T-shirts (at least mine) never come out fully clean.These Hanes T-shirts have earned their way into our household staples and I'm sure I'll be buying quite a lot more--especially given the unbeatable price.

  I ordered from these guys 2 months ago and a few days ago with the only difference being from a size M to L and I got entirely different pack that doesn't even come in hanes packaging and it has a tag unlike the previous order. Poor quality cotton, itchy and very firm to the point where your body doesn't look normal in it because of its straightness and unwillingness to conform to the movment of the body. This was also the case for the first purchase from then when i bought the medium pack but it came really tight and going from medium to large feels like going up 2-3 sizes. Terrible buy, definitely going to return it.

",1.0,Martha Clements,"Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2021","









  
  
    
  These tee shirts are unacceptable.  They were supposed to be Hanes Tees. I received 4 off brand t-shirts that are as rough and stiff as a board even after two washings in a perfectly good washing machine and tumbled on gentle in a dryer with soften sheets.  The tees bore no tags or imprint in the back neck as all good products do especially Hanes who are only first quality.  I advise anyone contemplating buying tee shirts on Amazon to be aware and make sure the tee shirts you order are brand name and a known product.  Very disappointed.  My man will not wear them.  I hope Amazon can intervene and take the seller off the sales list on site. I'd hate for others to be disappointed as I am.

  Nothing close to ""ComfortSoft"" at all as stated. Even after several washes and dry, these shirts are still itchy and uncomfortable and if you are wearing it during warm days you will sweat in them and it will become itchy on your skin. I wear this as my undershirt for work while wearing my uniform-issued short sleeve button down shirt and I'm already sweating within minutes. I had 3 older versions of Hanes ComfortSoft Ts  just like these ones before and they were very soft and not itchy to wear. The material was perfect and not too thick or too thin. These newer ones here are just ridiculously too thick and itchy.

  As other reviewers have stated, these do not say ""ComfortSoft"" and are not tagless. They may be Hane's and they may be 100% cotton, but they are just low quality t-shirts. I ordered this item in early 2018 and they were tagless, said ""Comfortsoft"", and were fairly comfortable for a t-shirt; the last 2 times ordering, I received shirts with tags that said ""Hane's"", but did not say ""Comfortsoft"" and were not quite as comfortable. Regarding cotton content - there are different grades of cotton; an item could be 100% cotton and still be scratchy or it could be a very high quality cotton fiber and be silky smooth. These are just cheap, basic T-shirts. I need them for work and I am not expecting them to last forever anyway (last package of 4 lasted about 6 months and that package was supplementing the other 4 I already had). My speculation is that this is a T-shirt made by Hanes in bulk for Amazon to hit a certain price point (about $3.50 each retail). Amazon does need to modify the description if they are not ComfortSoft else we are wading into false advertising territory.

  This is more about the listing than the shirts. I bought three different colors and each was different. One was thick, 100% cotton, second was thin, 90% cotton, while the third was 50% cotton/ 50% polyester. Even though the banner in the middle of the page says ""100% Cotton"". And from reading reviews, even with the same color, the shirts you receive may be different depending on where they are sourced. This is ridiculous and Amazon should put a stop to it.

When you order them from amazon they will ship in economy style packaging which equates to 4 shirts, loosely laid together in one unmarked thin plastic bag which is A-Okay with me, i'm sure it cuts cost and lowers price.

  My husband bought both Large and Medium.  He is 5'9"" and slim figured. He typically wears a large. But at first when he tried them on the large size it looked too big for him. He looked a little frumpy and disproportion. Then he tried on the medium size one and it was just a tad to tight on him making it uncomfortable to wear. We then figured it out that the length of the Large T-shirt was the problem for the large sized one - it was about 2 1/2 inches too long. He liked the material and the fit of the T-shirt. So I had them sewn up to match his regular preferred length.  He sprayed his own decal on them and enjoys wearing them now. They did not shrink after I washed them and dried them on high heat. The material is thicker (old school) than the new modern type T-shirts.
