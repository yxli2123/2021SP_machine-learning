After 2weeks they're dead and its frustrating to constantly replace them. The other amazon white batteries were the best but thsese are garbage.

  I recently purchased 3 sets of the 12 D cell battery packs for my outdoor motion detector lights.  Upon receiving the batteries, which were packaged very well, I tested each battery with a volt meter before installing them in the lights.  All batteries had a charge of between 1.61 and 1.62 volts.  These batteries are rated at 1.5 volts, so all were above the listed voltage.  How they hold up is another question that I will answer after some time has passed.

  These batteries seemed like a great buy until I needed them during Hurricane Irma and they couldn't power the battery-operated fan I wanted to lend to my neighbor whose power was out.I bought these batteries in May 2017, and while they worked in a flashlight they did not work in the battery-operated fan. At first I assumed that the problem was with the fan. Then this week I bought other batteries and tried the fan and it worked. I double checked and the Amazon batteries still did not work in the fan.So, if I could return these I would. Don't count on them powering much other than a basic flashlight.

  I purchased these batteries to power my baby’s toy. These batteries seem to work great. Based on the reviews, I was a bit worried about purchasing a bunch of batteries that could be duds. Then I looked at the reviews more in detail and realized that most of the bad reviews were from a few years ago. Amazon must have fixed their issues since then.Some things I noted are that:1. These are not rechargeable. If you want rechargeable batteries, you should purchase the amazon basics rechargeable batteries.2. There’s not much of a price difference between these Amazon basics batteries (12 pack) and the Energizer Max D (12 pack). At the time of this writing, there’s only a 50 cent difference (Amazon Basics - $14.49, Energizer Max ($15). If you want a brand name, you may as well go for Energizer Max.3. A Duracell 8 pack ($13.98) is only approximately 50 cents less than the Amazon Basics 12 pack ($14.49).Overall, these batteries work fine. If you don’t need a brand name batteries, you should just purchase these.

    Arrive with good charge and sized right, maybe old stock
  
",4.0,Bryan,"Reviewed in the United States November 20, 2018","









  
  
    
  I put these on the voltmeter and got 1.62 V reading on each of 3 I tested.  I compared them to two other new/unused D cells, the Duracell Coppertop (assembled in US) and the Rayovac Fusion, both of which tested at 1.61V.  The Amazon cell and the other two were all nearly exactly (within 2/10 of a mm) the same length and diameter.  The expiration dates on the Amazon cells were Oct 2022; the expiration dates on the Duracell and Rayovac cells were Mar 2027 and Nov 2025, respectively, and I've had those cells for about a year.  Maybe Amazon puts more realistic expiration dates on their cells, or maybe they ship older stock, who knows.  The packaging of the Amazon cells was very solid...two rows of 6 cells, each row shrink-wrapped, and a cardboard divider between the pos & neg terminals as the two rows lay lengthwise in the box.  The packaging makes them great to use for long-term emergency storage, especially if the expiration dates are usually further out like the competition...unless those dates are all BS anyway.  The voltmeter doesn't lie.  I would not trust these to leave in a device long term...I assume they would leak like every other Chinese alkaline battery I have ever used.  I wish Energizer Ultimate Lithium made D cells...their AA and AAA non-rechargables are bulletproof and the gold standard in non-rechargeable cells.

P.S. to all potential hurricane sufferers:  You probably know this but don't store your hurricane lanterns, portable fans, radios, seasonal big flashlights et cetera with the batteries in them:  They'll die, leak, or both.

  We seem to go through batteries SO fast with all the toys and electronics that my kids and husband have.  I feel like I was always running out and buying more batteries and they seemed SO expensive.  We decided to try out the AamazonBasics batteries because they are cheaper than purchasing in the store...and because they are delivered to my front door and I don't have to remember to grab them at the grocery store or make a special trip out to get batteries.  So far we've been really impressed with these batteries.  I was afraid that they would be like the super cheap ones you can get at the dollar store and not really have much life to them and have to replace them even more frequently.  We've been using them in several well-loved (read used all the dang time!) toys as well as some electronic devices and we haven't had any issues with them not having a good life span to them.  We will definitely purchase these again when our supply gets low - thanks for an affordable, easy option to the seemingly never-ending need for batteries!

  I have had nothing but problems with these batteries from day one. I don't know if it is the batteries or the charger but they have never held a full charge. I complained about the charger and the seller was kind enough to send me a new charger but the same  ""error"" keeps appearing to the point that I never know if my batteries are charged or not. They are also very hot to the touch when I take them out of the charger.  I thought I was doing the right thing for the environment by using rechargeable batteries but it looks like I will have to go back to using regular batteries. I am very disappointed and would never recommend these batteries to anyone.

  batteries i recieved had an exparation date of 2024, this order was fufilled by amazon so there batteries have been in their warehouse for years aparently, I tend to use them up quickly so i dont care about the exparatioin date and they always provide the power and value i expect for the price but i am continualy dissapointed when i recieve amazon betteries because the exparation dates are nowhere near 10 years out, must are set to expire within 3 or 4 years of purchase in my experience.  when i purchase a box of duracells with the 10 year shelf life claim they are always reasonably new manufectured with exparation dates far off in the future, maybe ive just had bad luck but amazon continues to ship me batteries that are acouple years from exparation every time i order them, like i said i use them up quickly so its not to much of an issue to me but if your purchasing to keep on the shelf for a long time amazon batteries def arent for you.

  I really wanted to like the Amazon version for batteries. They are SO much more affordable than the other name brands in the market, but there is definitely a reason for that. They don't last anywhere near as long as their competitors. So in this case you are really getting what you pay for. They are so much lower in price because you will go through them so much more quickly than the other brands.

  Really hoping that these were going to be close to as good as name brands.  Was on a hunting trip and running sets of 3 D cells in Streamlight lanterns.  All three lanterns were running low and swapped out batteries for all three at the same time.  One lantern got a set of Energizers that had been laying around for about 5 years, one got a set of Duracells that had been around for about the same length of time, and the third lantern got a set of the Amazon basics that were less than a year old.Within two days the lantern with the Amazon basics was already showing the first level of depletion (green light -> orange light -> red light -> blinking red light).  Within another evening of use it was to the red light.  Both of the other sets were still on green the whole time.

  My first impression is that they are good batteries.  I purchased several sizes (AA, AAA, D etc) and have used them in kids toys and flashlights. Battery life seems good, nothing has failed so far.  Based upon other reviews I checked them over and all seem to be manufactured correctly - these look different from older reviews so I'm thinking they are ""new and improved.""The area for improvement is the packaging. I know, minor detail.  While I like the cardboard sleeve that they come in, the batteries themselves are shrink wrapped in plastic into groups of ~4 (depends on size).  The sleeve is fragile and now I just have a pile of loose batteries (a mix of shrink wrapped and loose ones).  It would be nice if the cardboard sleeve served as something to store / organize / dispense them, like Pez candy.  The bottom edge of the box needs to open - not the side.  Duck tape to the rescue.So far, yes I'd buy them again. Although I still use name-branded 9V in the fire-alarms.

  I have bought many types of AmazonBasics batteries because they are significantly cheaper than others.  In  most of my experiences the batteries have held up well and I'm satisfied with them.What I'm not sure of is whether or not these batteries are cheaper because they have less capacity (measured in mAh) which is kind of important to know.  You can't compare apples to apples unless you know how much you're going to get out of a battery.  So these batteries may look like a better deal than the name brand batteries because they are so cheap, but if they have 10x less mAh, then you're not getting a deal.  Do these batteries have 10x less capacity than Energizer or other brands??  I don't know ... because Amazon doesn't put that information in the description.  I mean, mAh capacity and the price are really the only two primary metrics people need to know to compare most batteries.  It's like buying a light bulb and not knowing if it's supposed to last 10 hours or 50,000 hours.  For such basic information as that I know it's not an oversight; Amazon has decided not to be forthcoming about it so it's certainly perceived as something they want to hide.With that concern in mind, my personal uses for batteries don't require a lot of power.  For TV remotes, air pumps, etc the AmazonBasics batteries seem to last long enough to be worth it.  I did notice that these batteries didn't seem to last long in a simple strand of LED lights we used for Christmas decorations.  I think it lasted for about 3 weeks even though we only turned the lights on during nighttime hours.  I would assume those little LED lights use almost no energy but that's the only example I have where the battery life seemed shorter than expected.Conclusion: For heavier activity I would probably buy batteries that I knew had longer life.  For simple around-the-house usage these work just fine.

Winters in the upper midwest get cold, but these batteries kept the lights going brightly every night for 6 hours, for a month and still have juice in them.  I removed them from the lights and packed them away until next Christmas.

  I have used these batteries in a mag lite flashlight & they're still working & I'm currently using them in my motion detecting trashcan. I've had to replace them before 6 months passed but the 4 that are in it now are still going. However the motion sensor stopped working about a week ago & the only thing I can attribute it to is the batteries. When I first installed a set the trashcan wouldn't open on it's own. After rearranging the batteries it started working,this was day one mind you. Now here we are months later & the can will not open via sensing any motion. It will only work if I use the open & close buttons. Until I try another brand to see if it will work,these batteries are the only constant in prior sensor issues as well as the current issues I will continue to believe it could be the batteries. I will change this review if another set of batteries made by another company doesn't change the current status of my trashcan lid.

  Welp, never thought I would say this because I have always been a durracel battery girl but Amazon Batteries are the BEST batteries I have ever bought.  No leaking, they last so much longer than other batteries, like weeks longer.  Im honestly shocked at how good these are.  Buy them, try them and you will see the battery life is much longer.  My Luminara Candles that go 5 hours a day automatically still have the original Amazon batteries in them now for the past 2 months.  I have some other candles that go 6 hours on 18 off and they just quit after 3 months.  I never seen batteries last like this since the 1990's before crap was being made in China.

  Good value batteries.  I usually grab my batteries from Costco, but even though Costco is just about a mile away from my house, I hate the crowd in the parking lot and the crowds and lines inside.  So, I opted to just buy these with my Prime membership and had it on my porch the next day or so.  They look, feel, and work like regular D batteries.  I haven't noticed the difference in this brand compared to any other brand.  I really like the packaging - it was a lot easier to open.  The box holds the batteries well and can be used to keep the batteries in it until they are all gone.  Not like the plastic, sharp, hard-to-open plastic that many batteries come in and that you have to throw away.I can't attest to the amount of power or how long it lasts for.  I don't have anything to compare it to nor do I feel like wasting time and money trying to figure it out.  If it is noticeably less or more, then I'll say so.  Other than that, I would buy these again because of the convenience of receiving it as well as the nice box the batteries can stay stored in.

This is not as problem for man devices, but at least on one device i have, it is. The batteries go on fine, but are very difficult to remove. I need a screwdriver to pry the first one out.

  Bought five different types of batteries and the D, C, and 9volt did not have the full five year shelf life remaining.  That's the problem.  Paid for five years and didn't get it.  Also the comparison of batteries compared your batteries with all the ten year shelf life batteries... NOT a true comparison at all... In fact misleading... Like comparing a five year old car to a ten year old car... Bad product comparison and not what was paid for.  Wasn't worth it to have to pay shipping to return batteries in order to get an exchange.

  These batteries are an excellent value for my money...I expect them to last a long time...I have no idea what motion detection means so gave that an OK..I read a long time ago, that the brand of the battery didn't matter much when purchasing them.  I have been purchasing this brand in different sizes for the last year or so, and I believe that is true.Will update my review in case anything changes.  These were ordered through Prime and delivered to my door.  The trip to the nearest store is 40 minutes one way.

  Good quality batteries.  The power output and longevity of these batteries in my equipment seem comparable to the Rayovac and Duracell alkaline cells I use, and I haven't had a single rupture or leak.  Out all the cells I've used so far, every one performed well, without a single dud.  For the money, I think these are the best D-Cells out there - and I've tried a LOT.  Here's my results of real-world usage (most favorite, to least favorite):AmazonBasics - Good power output, average longevity, consistently low price.Rayovac - Good power output, great longevity, varied price (I find good deals every few weeks).  Never seem to leak.Ikea - Average power output (flickers a little), fair longevity, usually the lowest price.Maxell - Good power output, great longevity, good price, but one in every few dozen eventually leaks.Duracell - Good power output, great longevity, varied price, but one in every few dozen eventually leaks.Sunbeam - Average power output, fair longevity, consistently low price, but prone to leakage.Energizer - Inconsistent power output (some flicker a lot, some don't), average longevity, can be expensive, and seem VERY prone to leakage.As such, I now use the AmazonBasics in all of my everyday-use D-cell flashlights, lanterns, and motion sensors.  I save the Rayovacs for stuff I keep in storage, and in my emergency kits.  I'm currently storing a few AmazonBasics to test them for leakage, and - thus far - I haven't had a single one leak.  I'll update my review, as I use them further.

  We have countless battery operated devices around the house, so we go through batteries like they’re going out of style. I've always used the big name brands and obviously they are never cheap, even on sale. I'd never tried these, but I buy basically everything on Amazon, so figured why not batteries.  Considering they’re at least 25% cheaper than the lowest known brand, even if they didn’t last quite as long it’s worth it.  After using them in half a dozen different devices, it turns out they last as long as popular brand batteries. They way they’re packaged makes them so easy to organize and store.  Now I have them in AAA, AA and D.  It’s the only brand I’ll buy!

  Any parent of a toddler goes through an insane amount of batteries.  We thought Amazon batteries would be a great alternative to more expensive name brands.  Unfortunately, Amazon batteries die twice as fast as name brand batteries (if not faster), not only making them more expensive but producing twice the waste and recycling.  Hope Amazon gets its act together.  Until then, we will stick with Duracell or Energizer...

  When I first got them they didn't work! Then I realized it's because it was so cold outside. After they warmed up they have worked just like batteries should!

  Used to buy ""dollar store"" as I thought I was saving money, but they don't last and tend to leak. Bought a bundle price and saved money and know I can trust Amazon batteries to last.
