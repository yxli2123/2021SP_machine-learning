    Great Product

  So I normally use my Ninja Foodie which is really expensive! So I did a comparison between the 2 and this Air fryer cooks exactly the same as my foodie. Same cook temp, time and everything.  I do like the look of this one better and it has replaced my foodie on the counter lol I love the ease of use of the buttons and the display looks very nice and clean. I love the basket release button its not come loose on me at all so far  It's also square and fits food better inside than the foodie does. It also fits a lot better on my counter. It's very easy to clean and easy to check on food during cooking and The food tastes great! This actually seems to cook a tad hotter than my ninja so I can probably even do less time on meals. I love the reheat button! My kids love how reheated pizza comes out in it. Ribs come out amazing in here! I baked them and then added bbq sauce and air fryed about 10 minutes!! I would definitely recommend this air fryer. Will update if I find any complaints after longer use.

  I‚Äôve been wanting an air fryer for a long time and I finally made the plunge. This air fryer got some many 5 star reviews I had to get it. The basket is huge and fits a lot. First time trying it and we made wings! Tip: if you want crispy wings shake some baking powder on them. They came out super crispy compared to my first batch. Highly recommend this airfryer! It‚Äôs quite, easy to clean, and cooks amazing!! A must buy!

    Great unit for the price
  
",5.0,Isle of Glass,"Reviewed in the United States September 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  While I am generally going to praise this unit, please do know that it is a lower priced unit with a lot of plastic.  I found this out by accidentally letting the drawer bang on the granite counter, resulting in plastic clips which hold the front cover together breaking off.  HOWEVER, the unit still functions (looks like it has a loose bumper) and Amazon has offered to replace the unit even though I said it was my fault and was inquiring about a replacement drawer (foolish me).Soooo.... for the price this unit cooks great, has great capacity and is easy to use and easy to clean.  This is our first air fryer and it works better than expected.  Don't expect deep fryer results, but expect most of the way there with much more healthy results.My adult aged son is a picky eater, doesn't cook much, but he loves fried foods.  He's taken to the air fryer very quickly and makes his own mozzarella sticks, fried tofu and more.  That's the result we wanted!

  ¬†I have a ninja air fryer, but I needed 2 air fryers. Buying another ninja is expensive ($400$). So I relied on our old friend amazon cutting the store lines and expensive brands.Wish I would have bought this instead of splurging that much on a ninja. It‚Äôs smaller but it does the same. Crispy fries and Crispy chicken. On top of the air fryer it guides you with the proper temperature for each food group. No more guessing. Will buy some for Christmas gifts. Hope this helps you save money and time as it did for me.

  My wife loves this machine she hasn,t cooked with  anything else since xmas easy clean easy to use awsome flavor a must have. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is that it advertises 110 free recipes included, but it doesnt.i tried to reach out to the company using  the email address giving to me on the instruction  booklets and it says not a valid e-mail address, so I looked online and found a company  email address but no response.but that doesnt take away from the product it works awsome.UPDATE I know alot of people are complaining about not being able to find the 110 recipes believe me it was a pain in the A but I hope this helps on the description  look real close for application pdf it,s really small u will need to download a pdf reader I use Adobe acrobat  reader in ur play store it s free after u install the pdf reader press application pdf and waka theres ur 110 recipes comfee promised good luck

    First time air fryer - takes trial and error.
  
",4.0,DownundaOne,"Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  Only used it about 10 times so far. I have over/under cooked a few things.  I have so far found that baking Pillsbury grands took a little more time than online recipes (lower heat as well). Apparently it takes very little oil spray to brown (mine overbrowned and undercooked in the middle). French fries after a couple of tries came out well. This is a basic (cheap) model. I did not want to blow a lot of money on something that I did not know if I would like. The only downside I see is that the timer is a dial and apart from 10 min intervals it's hard to get accurate (is t 12 or 13 on the deal). For the money it's worth it. When done correctly the food does taste good.

  I‚Äôm blown away by the tastiness of the food coming out the air frier.  Also saves time compared to using an oven!  Cuts time to cook in almost half!  It cooks fried food great, tastes basically like a real deep fry with a lot less calories, quicker  and a lot easier clean up.  It also can bake and reheat items really well!  Things like eggo waffles or pancakes come out great.I haven‚Äôt tried the dehydrate function but it‚Äôs also advertised as doing that.Other reviews mentioned problems with the basket?  I have experienced none of those issues.  There‚Äôs a button that has a flap that is used to control that function.  And it‚Äôs very easy to NOT PRESS , especially because it is protected by a plastic cover...So all in all, it cooks great and I didn‚Äôt have any problems other reviewers mentioned.  Very happy with my purchase

  So, my friends are all super in love with their air fryers.  I‚Äôm less impressed.  It turned a frozen burrito into a hard block.  It only cooked one side of the grilled cheese, and took a while doing it.  I will admit, that it reheats takeout fries like a dream!  And mr loves it for his tots.  I just expected to like it more/ use it more.  I‚Äôm going to try baked potatoes next, I think.  The girls said they loved them in it.  We‚Äôll see.  I imagine as I get used to it, it‚Äôll probably be good.  My niece loves theirs, and uses it all the time.  I‚Äôm probably just weird.  Nothing new there.

",4.0,Bree-,"Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2021","









  
  
    
  I like mostly everything about this air fryer. It's my new favorite appliance. It makes the crispiest fried chicken and it's great for cooking single servings or enough for 2. The only thing I didn't like was the numbers and all of the lettering completely wiped off after the first use. Overall a great product but now I have to guess the temperature I'm cooking my food at.

",5.0,Shannon,"Reviewed in the United States August 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  I ordered this to use as a dehydrator to make backpacking meals. Works like a charm! The basket is large enough to hold a decent amount of whatever I'm dehydrating and the machine dehydrates evenly and thoroughly when shaken well in the middle of the dehydrating cycle. I haven't used it to cook with yet since my intention was to use it as a dehydrator but based on my experience so far, this machine should work exceptionally well for cooking too.

It still has an instruction book to show how to cook the raw food such as fish , chicken and vegetables. You can become good at cook even you don't like to cook before. It makes your kitchen clean, oilless and more safety. It is a must have machine in the kitchen.

  This is a very popular kitchenware. I bought the air fryer cuz my friends recommended it to me. And I am very satisfied with that so far. My son likes fried meat and French fries. It is much easier for me to use the air fryer than the stove. And save a lot time on cleaning and cooking.  I only need to put the seasoned meat in the fryer and set the time, then I can do the other job while I am waiting.

  It is easy to set the cook time and temperature. I used 380 F for 25 min to cook the chicken wings, they are much crispier on the outside than the one cooked by the oven. I think it has a coated anti-stick layer inside, and it is very easy to clean by just resining with soap water. Nice air fryer for 50 bucks.

    The Glue Smells.
  
",1.0,Glen C.,"Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  This fryer works well.  It does its job but the container that the basket fits in is glued together with a devil of a glue that will stink up the inside of your entire home.  It reeks and after heating the thing up for an hour on high, washing it, and sticking it outside, it still stinks.  Now winter is coming up.  If you are in a cold climate where you wont keep the door open then this fryer is a bad choice.  If you want a cheap fryer that works and you have no sense of smell then go for it.Update Edit:  I can't get rid of the very strong glue smell after trying for a few weeks.  I will send it back and I am changing my rating from 3 stars to 1 star.  Too bad because if I could get rid of the smell it would be fine but that isn't happening.

",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2021","









  
  
    
  This is my first air fryer, so I don‚Äôt yet have much experience in using them. Based on my experience for a few weeks, I can say the following with certainty:-It cooks faster than an oven when cooking precooked items, like chicken tenders or precut fries.-It sounds about as loud as a microwave. You can definitely hear the flow of air.-It is easy to clean as it leaves very little mess behind. (It‚Äôs hot air, after all.)-You can‚Äôt layer too many things on top of one another without having an open airway available. Piling chicken breasts on top of one another and trying to fit in as many as possible isn‚Äôt going to work.The device itself is simple and effective. You have two analog dials, one for a timer, and one for temperature. The timer dial can be moved backwards (with some resistance) without seemingly damaging the unit. There are no displays, only two LED lights.I‚Äôd say this is a nice beginner unit into the world of air frying, and great for one to two people max. I strongly believe that you would need a bigger fryer for anymore than two people. Based on its price, size, and ease of use, I‚Äôd recommend this air fryer to anyone curious about trying one out.

    Good Electric Air Fryer
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  I owned a little air fryer (1.2 qt) and I am always happy with it. But recently the coating of the basket starts to peel off. I realize it is time to have a new one.The 3.7 QT air fryer is much bigger than I thought. I was amazed by a huge package from Amazon.Key features:(1) Dimension of the air fryer: Height 11.5'' * diameter 8.5''(2) Dimension of the basket (for food): Height 6.5'' * diameter 8.5''(3) Two knobs: one for time and the other for temperature(4) 1400 W (very powerful!)(5) 3.7 QT (very big, more than enough for a two people family)I like the most is the design of the basket can be released from the drawer (see the third photo), so I can wash them separately and much more easily.The second favorite feature is that the air fryer is very powerful and warm food quickly. I used it to warm the fried chicken. It worked amazingly! The chicken get hot quickly and the surface is super crispy.As the manual recommends, the first time I used, I let the air fryer run by itself for 10 minutes + 400 F. There was a strange plastic smell. But the smell is gone in my second and third usages.

",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is a great air fryer. So far I made french fries and it worked well every time. I also heated frozen fried chicken strips with great results. What I liked most about this air fryer is that the frying basket can be detached from the housing, unlike the other air fryer I reviewed before this one. This gives me the chance of unloading the cooked food with ease. Little oil or drips etc. at the bottom of the housing aren't getting mixed with the food when unloading. I also liked that there are foods and cooking times information on the top of the air fryer for quick reference. The only thing that I didn't like about this air fryer is the controls. I wish the controls were digital just like the other air fryer I reviewed. Nonetheless, overall this is a good air fryer and I would recommend it.

  Good quality. Easy to start-up and use. Pretty clear functions. Just set up your temperature and timer and it will start rolling.The food comes out crispy from the outside and tender from the inside if you choose your right temperature.Heats up pretty quickly and evenly. You may need to open the basket and turn over the food inside for better results.The 3.7QT is VERY small, I would definitely recommend that you take the bigger size especially if you're a family.The price for the smaller size could actually get you a bigger decent airfryer from another brand. But it's still good.Easy to clean. Be gentle when you clean it as you can scratch the inside easily. Handwash only.Overall it's a good product and works just fine. Recommended.

  I had a Chefman air fryer that I use on a regular basis. This Comfee 3.7Qt air fryer is now my favorite. Here is the review.The good:- The detachable non-stick basket is so easy to use. Unlike most air fryer (including the Chefman one) I have seen, which use a plate to create a space on the bottom, this Comfee air fryer use a detachable basket which is so easy to use. This is definitely my favorite feature.- The analogy controller is intuitive to use and allow me to quickly find the temperature and time I want to set. They work much better than digital controller which I have to register multiple clicks in order to use it.- 1400W cooks fast and reliably.- 3.7Q is not big but good for my family.Other thoughts:I do miss the preset button for digital control but I can live with that.

  This Comfee air fryer is a very basic model.  It doesn't have any digital controls or screens like the more expensive models.  It just has a dial for the temperature, and a dial for the time.  But for most foods that you might want to cook in it, that's fine.  It works as well as other air fryers I have used for simple foods like french fries or fish sticks.  The capacity is only 3.7 quarts, so it's a bit small compared to most other models I have seen.  But it's still large enough to fix a meal for 2 people.

  Not a top of the line air fryer, but it is nice for the price. The timing dial is a drawback as it is hard to adjust for precise times. A digital timer would be a nice improvement. The suggested recipe times are okay, but after getting under cooked fries I learned that you have to adjust the times to suit the situation. Frozen fries definitely take longer than recommended. Also, be sure to shake up your basket as all the heat emanates from the top of the frier. Will take a while to get used to using.

  This airfryer's basket is big enough to fit 2 lbs. of chicken wings (as pictured). And damned good wings they are! This is the first dish I cooked in this airfryer, received yesterday. It is almost a no brainer to operate, just load the basket with your favorite food, push it in, push the button and that was it. For these wings, I turned them at around 5 minutes left. They came out delicious. Even got an approval from my wife. My next tests will include baked potatoes, small whole chicken and char-siu chicken and pork, not all of the same time of course. What a time saver. There are all kind of options for whatever dish you want to cook.The reason I gave it 4 stars is you can not just put the basket in the dish washer. Not a big deal, they are easy enough to be washed by hand, but for a lazy person as I am, that one more chore to do after having a good meal.

  I ordered this and then returned it without opening it, I thought it would be too small, and after I read the reviews- after ordering, I was suspect since the reviews were mixed in with 2 models, plus: Chinese! I then ordered another that was SO gigantic! A 6.9qt. It was very un-user-friendly and when I washed it, it already looked pitted! Or at the very least, like it was starting to. After one use. Again, it was a huge Chinese one that the buttons had a mind of their own. Now this one: extremely easy to set, as in: that k you. It set the machine to exactly what I wanted, no fighting with it! Per the pic, I have lotsa ribs in there. Probably too many. It seems to cook better in the rear of the machine, my ribs are 158-182! I'm assuming this might be used error! I was going off a Keto cookbook recipe. So my first thoughts are: extremely easy to set and use. Seems like it will be easy to clean, we'll see. I'm actually thrilled with it. I might hit broil on these, can't seem to get some of them cooked evenly! Otherwise, I'm thrilled and sorry to Amazon for ordering this one, not opening it, ordering it again! I love Amazon! Will update after I cook a few more things in it! Glad I have a meat thermometer! Can get that on Amazon too! - and this is a real review from a real person!

    This air fryer is more than a fryer
  
",5.0,Wise Little Hoots,"Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  My old air fryer crashed on me so it was time to try a new one.  There's so many on the market so it's hard to pick one. I think I'm pretty happy with my choice though.  While my other air fryer had specific settings for different foods it was just an air fryer. This one is so much more. There are multiple settings like air fry, toast, bake and even dehydrate! I used it for regular heating of frozen foods and used to toast option to heat up and melt the cheese on my fajitas last night.  It's very powerful,  tells you when to shake the basket half way through and the basket insert is as deep as the entire casing 6qt, which is nice because my old one had just a grill liner for the bottom and was the first thing to break. Overall I'm happy with my purchase so far.

    COMFEE really nice.
  
",5.0,Patricia,"Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have had the COMFEE air fryer 5.8 qt for a little more than 2 months. Wanted to give it good use before giving my review on this product. I've made fries (frozen and fresh made), lamb chops, biscuits, baked potatoes (sweet, and white).I've made chicken wings (hot, sticky, lemon pepper, and plain fried) made from scratch pot pies, fruit pies, even did Field Roast brand vegan burgers. All came out nicely and flavorful. Made all kinds of chicken, fish, and veggies dishes, season kale chips  All came out very flavorful, eye appealing good.I got this just to see what all the rave was, about air fryers. It was inexpensive, and it has the lowest temp and longest time cycle for dehydration (for an air fryer)than some of the others I looked at, and they were more pricey.I read the instruction booklet which tells you what to expect and prepare for first time use. I preferred to soak it (basket and basket casing) which are washable. I didn't want to run the fryer for a few minutes as they suggested ( its burning off the chemical smell creating a white smoking, releasing the smell in the house. Soaking in white vinegar and hot water will alleviate that and no smelling up the house. MAKE SURE YOU WASH THESE PARTS WITH HOT SOAPY WATER, RINSE, THEN SOAK IN VINEGAR SOLUTION (about 10- 15 mins)I'm pleased with this purchase. Would suggest you get an air fryer accessories kit which helps out a lot making clean up easier.You can cook up enough for 2-3 people.After using this for a while you will be able to work time and temp for preparing your food. No preheat button but is very easy to do if you choose to. Air fry has alert to shake feature.The noise is no louder than a micro wave.This does not heat up my kitchen like a conventional oven or counter top convection oven and that's a plus for me. When summer comes I will be using this, its quick with much less heat.If your thinking about getting a Airfryer but don't have a lot of space or want to spend a lot right now I would say try this to get a feel of what these fryers are able to do. Simply good,  easy prepared, fresh foods made quick.I'm glad I got this one.

  Was alright when we first got this, but it‚Äôs small.  You can only do 2 burgers at a time as opposed to the 4 we could do in our previous fryer. The big ding against this one is the fact that the inter tray separates without even pressing the release button. Several times I have pulled the tray out to turn the burgers and the bottom falls away sending the grease flying across the floor and up the cabinets :/  Luckily we got the protection plan so I‚Äôll try to get a new one and see if it‚Äôs the same or just a defect in this one case.

  I must have gotten a dud since there are so many good reviews.  The timer did not work and I could hardly turn the dial.  Every time I took out the basket to stir I would have to turn the timer off.  Also, I don‚Äôt think it heated properly because I could not get my fresh sweet potato fries to cook and I must have tried for 40 minutes.

  I like this little unit...well it's not really little but it does do a good job! I've air fried a number of things in it including wings, drumsticks, prefrozen packaged food and appetizers, french fries, and even hot dogs. They have all come out great!I do recommend that when air frying, you open it up every five minutes and toss/shake the food around quickly. It allows the air to circulate to all parts of your food. You get a better overall ""fry"" when you do this.It is also relatively easy to clean after use. I usually rinse out any residual oil and then take the main container with perforated food container and fill with water and dishwashing soap. I scrub out both....they are non-stick coated so it's pretty easy. After rinsing, I just shove the unit back into the main housing and turn the heat to about 300 for about 5 minutes to dry it out and it's good to go whenever you need it!As you can see from the pictures, there are recommendations for fryer temps and cooking times. I use the temps recommended but I have found that cooking times are usually a bit longer than is indicated. So just don't blindly follow the information printed on the top....it is only a recommendation. Cooking times will vary depending on the amount of food you place in the unit to cook as well as if you shake/toss the food every five minutes or so. Other than that, this is a great little unit. Everything is analog to all you have is a dial for temp and time. There are no LEDs or special programming functions....just turn it on and it works! I recommend it for anyone that wants a simple air fryer and doesn't have need for a bunch of bells and whistles.

    Great fryer. Delicate parts.
  
",4.0,,"Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  This was my first time using an air fryer, so I can't compare it against any others. For a beginner, this fryer is simple to use & easy to clean.The fryer has two knobs, one that's a wind-up kind of timer, and the other sets the temperature. Neither of them are digital, so it's a bit difficult to tell exactly how long the timer was set for and if the temperature is at the correct setting. Additionally, there are unequal gradients between the listed temps, i.e. it goes from 180¬∞ to 210¬∞ to 250¬∞. Unless you're using 400¬∞ (max), it's hard to ascertain what the exact temperature is set to.The fryer has a thermostat - the heating element turns on and off as needed to maintain the proper temp. There's a light indicator which shows if it's presently heating or not.The machine is smart and automatically turns off when the basket is taken out in middle of frying. (That'll hopefully prevent any fried finger accidents.) It then restarts as soon as you put the basket back in. As another safety measure, the basket can't be removed from the fryer without pushing the safety button release on the handle. It's useful for preventing accidents and for child safety reasons. Just be careful to release the button so that the drawer and basket are attached when you remove them together, so they don't fall apart and splatter when one removes their food.The food has come out great so far. As expected, the food is only as good as the cook.The basket isn't made of the sturdiest materials. The basket fell on the floor at one point (cleaning) & afterwards, the locking mechanism didn't click into place. The fryer still works, but the safety lock no longer works right. I just hope it won't affect the frying process.Tl;Dr: great fryer for beginners. Easy to clean, easy to use.

My son eats a lot of frozen food like chicken nuggets and fish sticks. I usually cook it up on a mini oven but I decided to get rid of it and start using the air fryer. The bag on the air fryer said 360 degrees for 3 to 4 minutes. Teh instruction book to this air fryer said to add 3 minutes of ""prep"" time if it's not already. So I put it in for 6 minutes 10 fish sticks. The picture shows how it came out. Of course, it was cooked and it wasn't cold inside but it wasn't crispy. So my son was not happy about it. So we put it in again for another 10 minutes. Again, my son said it was only crispy a little on one side. He said he liked the oven better. In the end, he ate it but the timing on it didn't match what I thought it should be.  When I try it again with other food, I'll come back and edit this review. But for now I did want to explain that first try.I do also want to mention putting this together. it was as simple as it get. They had an instruction book inside that had visual and it was super explicit. You could put it together without reading anything becaause really nothng to do! ha! But you do have to know there is a button on the handle where you have to press it and lift at the same time to get the inner part out. Ohterwise, everything is self explanatory.So you you need to put the food in the basket and then put it in the machine all the way. It will not work if it's not in all the way. Do not put any oil or anything in it. HOWEVER, my sister said if you sprintz just a tiny oil on the food, it makes it more crispy!Then you just set the temperature. On top of the machine, it actually even gives suggested time!After that, to turn it on, you actually just set the time. The time goes to 60 minutes (one hour). The tick marks are at every 5 minutes. So it is very hard to estimate like 3 minutes or numbers that are not divisible by 5. But it really is okay if you just round it.It didn't super dirty or anything but you do need to clean it. The basket that comes out is super easy to clean. Just run it through hot water or so. But inside the machine, it does get dirty too and you will need to get a cloth and wet it and clean it. The whole bottom part DOES come out though also.Overall for now, I think I do like it because 1. its so easy to use, 2. easy to clean, 3. healthy. But I am not sure about the crispiness yet. As I try other foods, I'll report back if I learn something new.I hope this has helped someone!

  My wife and I have an air fryer we've enjoyed greatly for a year or so, and we decided to give my mom one for Christmas.  Got her this one and we're very happy with it.  At 3.7 quarts it's a little smaller than our 5 quart fryer, but mom lives alone and doesn't need as much capacity as our family of four does.  The unit seems well made and is easy to understand and use.  Mom cooked a whole chicken in it (the fairly large bird just fit in the basket) as her first dish, and it turned out great.  Cleanup is so easy too.  Not a bad thing that the unit looks very handsome too.  I like the silver finish on it much more than the white plastic finish on ours.  Great unit all around and we're very happy with it.

  Very happy with this air fryer.  It is easy to operate, and the results are great.  Easy temperature control, timer, everything is straightforward and simple.  Non stick surface is a breeze to clean up.  No oil required, so much more healthy with no effort.  Foods cook quickly and evenly.  Making your own french fries, buffalo wings, chicken nuggets is so easy.  Chicken breasts come out perfectly.  Comes with a a few recipes and all the settings you need to get started.  There are endless recipes online to expand your menu once you get used to it.  Good quality at a very reasonable price.  Fun and functional.

  This is the only air fryer I have ever used, so I have nothing to compare it to. It had a slight chemical smell to it when I opened it, which persisted after I washed it the first time. The smell didn‚Äôt affect the taste of the food. You unfortunately can‚Äôt get precise cook time or temperature due to the way the dials are labeled. I had to estimate since the recipe called for 8 minutes, but it turned out okay.  Overall, it was very easy to use and clean, and it will allow me to make healthier versions of meals I enjoy.

  I gifted this to my stepson for Christmas. He recently got his first apartment so this was perfect for him, I helped him figure it out. It had just enough space for him to do his chicken nuggets, fries and all the easy stuff he needed after work! It‚Äôs quick and easy for him to figure out. It‚Äôs also easy for him to clean, that‚Äôs another thing he liked about it. We liked the slick design too, looks great on the countertop.

  What could be the big deal about an air fryer? It is the right size and it cooks the food well enough. The basket part sits so close down to the base that all the oil that drains from the basket into the base still touches the bottom of the basket. It makes cleaning annoying and I never feel like the food is as oil-free as I have with other air fryers.The basket also does not slide easily out of the base. In addition the timing now has to turn off by itself. If I am finished earlier and want to turn it off, the unit does not shut off until the timing has run down. Considering it is only a few weeks old I can only assume the quality of the materials is not great.

  It is a very simple unit that produces very good results. There are no extra gadgets that come with the unit but that reflects in the price. It is a product that feels very sturdy. So far we have only used it for a relatively short period of time but have been very pleased with the results.  As far as the durability only time will tell there  ( my unit is only a month old). All in all at this point I would say I can fully recommend the product as a good value and good working product.
