    Smoking & Electrical Burning, Stops Working, NO REFUNDS!!!
  
",1.0,beancounter,"Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2018","









  
  
    
  Our son used his two times, and on the third time, it smoked, smelling of electrical burning, and stopped working. Luckily, he had not fallen asleep and turned the power off immediately. After contacting the seller to request a refund/return/exchange, the seller closed the request with a pat message about ""the purchase being in the final stages so they're unable to process a cancellation.""  They did not address the issues presented, nor the refund request, leading one to believe that they knew they had a defective product, but could still keep the money. Sadly, they weren't wrong. Another reviewer stated that neither the first nor the second player she received some time ago worked.  Amazon cannot support a refund through their claim process as the item arrived ""intact.""  We now have no turntable & no money, but do feel blessed to still have our family and home safe. Interestingly, I was required to choose a star in order to provide a review.  I would give ZERO stars to this product and to the seller, as they must know by now that this product is defective and catches on fire.

    What’s the one thing you want from your record player? Squeaks.

   After about 10 hours of use, it started squeaking like crazy. Loud comical squeaks... like I have all sorts of things in my home that turn, rotate, and have electric motors. None of them squeak. But this sounds like a fart every rotation.Update: I took it apart and discovered a small piece of plastic that had wedged itself into the turning mechanism. I was able to put it back together, but I had to look up tutorials on how to get the belt back on. A slightly complicated repair for something the size of a fingernail. It works fine now, but still keeping the 1 Star review because of the hassle of having to fix a practically new record player.

   I love it the sound quality is pretty good to my standards. Ships fast. Volume is great. To future buyers be careful with the tonearm on any turntable. Always use the life and lower feature as well as the arm lock. And there is no slip mat so make sure you have one before playing records. There is also a replacement needle. And don’t touch the groves of the records so they’ll stay clean

    Why I DO NOT RECOMMEND you get this
  
",1.0,Phenomenon007,"Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2018","









  
  
    
  As is usual with most items on Amazon, as soon as negative reviews creep up, the item is reposted and the score is somewhat ""reset"".  Wish Amazon would fix this, but hey, they're making money so they obviously don't care.Record players are not usually made for travel use (or cheap for this case) because of the heft the arm a record player requires in order to have sufficient and tune-able weight on a record.  This is important because if enough weight is not placed on the arm, then you get skipping.  What can you do?  You can ghetto rig it by taping a penny or quarter at the top of the tip and see if this rectifies it.  If it fixes it, then it means you have a cheap record player.  AKA A Victrola record player.  Don't get this.  Just get a real one.  This might be worth it when it drops to $20, but not any more than that.

  I was hoping to love this turntable. But, I should have remembered that with electronics, we get what we pay for. It arrived in very flimsy box, no outer box for protection. The inside of the turntable had cardboard shavings of some sort throughout. It looked like it had been in a wood shop.I packaged it back up and returned it. I have purchased another brand, Audio Technica, that doesn't have the retro look I was hoping for, but the quality is what I was looking for.I would not recommend this unit to anyone.

  I'd like to start this off by saying I am not very educated on records or Bluetooth. I purchased this because I love all things vintage and I've been dying to play my Mary Poppins and Sound of Music records. I was a bit hesitant to purchase this record player because so many reviews mentioned the speakers being weak and needing to purchase a seperate Bluetooth speaker. So I decided to purchase it from a store in case I was disappointed with the speakers and wanted to return it. I bought this record player 2 days ago and have played 10 different records on it so far. I am completely satisfied with my purchase! I have a 4 bedroom ranch and with the volume all the way up I can hear music in every room! I'm sure if I had my loud family over for the holidays we would be able to hear the music no problem. Also, even being 24 I'm terrible when it comes to technology so I was nervous first setting up this player. It was so easy to do and I was able to listen to music in 5 minutes of opening the box. This record player completely filled my needs and exceeded my expectations. 5 stars!!!

  Absolutely disgusted, and disappointed.  I have purchased other “modern” record players, and found there to be poor quality sound, and even worse components.  Yet I had hoped that a record player with the name of “Victrola” behind it-  an absolutely  legendary name , in the phonograph industry-  would be the exception....  My hopes are for naught.  The speakers are horrific, and the 78 speed is too fast, and something that is all too common in electronic devices-  the headphone jack does not work properly.  If I had a dollar for every time this had happened when I have purchased electronics with headphone jacks, I could put myself through school and learn in-depth electronics, and create my own jacks, that actually work.  Do not purchase this record player, or any other modern (lower price) record player- especially the “retro” looking nostalgia types.  They are junk.  I want my money back “Victrola”.

    Great Record Player
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States September 11, 2018","









  
  
    
  This is not the highest quality record player you can buy, but it's still real good. This is a nice, inexpensive little turntable that is more than enough for those of us with small home collection of vinyl albums. I chose pink because it was the cheapest color at the time of purchase. It has built-in speakers, which was a requirement for me. But it also has an output so that you can play it through external speakers. This can't be connected to computer like some record players, but it is portable and very nice looking. It has three speeds and it will automatically stop playing once it reaches the end of a record, which is really, really nice. The built-in speakers aren't the greatest quality, and they don't get as loud as I'd like, but they're still good and more than acceptable. It comes with a back-up replacement needle, which is really cool. The biggest complaint is that the record hangs off the side, and it's designed in a way that you can't directly place the record onto the player. If you tried to place it directly down, it would bump into the needle arm. So when you place records on the player, you have to kind of angle it to go underneath the needle arm. But this is just a minor inconvenience at most. I would still recommend this player as it is great quality and relatively inexpensive.

   It’s much lighter than I expected, but it was packed in plastic bags and styrofoam so it was well protected in the box. Everything has a nice feel to it meaning it doesn’t feel cheap and the lid is lined with “velvet” and the “Victrola” is raised...nice little touch. I was a little surprised it wasn’t in a cardboard shipping box as it was just the regular manufacturer’s box like you’d buy it in at a store. However, it was in perfect condition. It set up and ran very easy. The only thing I’d change is better speakers, but they’re as good as I expect for this price and I planned on using Bluetooth speakers anyway. I’d also change the auto stop function so that the arm returns to the stand, but at least it has auto stop so you can be doing other things while listening to your music and not worry about the needle bumping the label repeatedly until you can get to it. I love the look and it works great. I think it’s a great deal for less than $50.

   First off before I write this review let me just say I did a lot of research on this kind of record player and even a few of my own experiments so i would consider what i found to be pretty credible. I wish someone wrote a review like this for me when I was considering buying it.#1 Is this a good record player for beginners or people who only want a few records to play for the aesthetic? Absolutely. The sound quality is meh, but I mean what do you expect for $40. It plays the records no problems, and the bluetooth is great for just whenever.Now here is how you can upgrade your setup with minimal spending. Get an RCA to mini jack cable. Plug that into a speaker you already have or if in my case you have a practice amp cause you play an instrument, get a mini jack to 1/4 converter and plug it into the amp! It works great!#2 Will this ruin my records?No. It will not. I made a little scale and using pennies weighed out the tracking force to be around 5g. Now compared to $200 record players that track at 3g this seems like a lot. But be aware, when records were made, they were made to withstand up to 7 or 8g of tracking force cause lots of old players tracked at around 5 or 6g. Now tracking heavier like this will yes, wear them out faster, but it will NOT ruin them! The needle is also a diamond, so the needle is pretty decent actually.Now you can actually fix the tracking force on this thing. Get a small scale, like the kind to bake with, put your tone arm on it, get some pennies and nickels and start stacking them at the back of the tone are where the counterweight should be. One your tone arm reads at about 3.5-4g. Take those coins, tape them together, and tape them to the back of that tone arm. Maybe even go for around 4-4.5g because in my experience these cheap ones skip very easily.#3 Is it portable?Absolutely not. You need to plug it into an outlet, and it could totally break with some throwing around. Also the lid is completely useless.I took the lid off by unscrewing the screws on the back hinges. The lid is NOT big enough even when open to run 12"" vinyls. The edge is right under your record, like millimeters under, and if you have ANY warping, at all it will hit the edge and cause it to skip. This is likely the problem a lot of people have when it skips and just don't know it. Just take the lid off its useless.#4 Does it skip? Does it sound weird?No, not at all. I had it skip on me once, and after replaying that section it never did it again. Probably was just my fault since i accidentally tapped the vinyl I was playing when getting it out of the sleeve. Also I tested the wow and flutter using a phone app. Let me tell you that it is BAD, like the wow and flutter is REALLY HIGH. But, even so, I didnt notice ANY sort of distortion in the sound. It might be worse when playing above 33rpm but at least for 33, its fine.#5 Is it worth the price?100% as long as you know what your getting. I didn't expect this player to be good or even great. Its okay at best and I'm fine with that cause its $40. If you are looking for a very nice player that delivers great sound quality, dont get this. If you want to really get into vinyl, dont get this. If you want to experience the most you can from your records, dont get this. If you want to just play a couple of records for cheap and have them in your room cause its cool and aesthetic, go ahead, im doin it for that exact reason.(Also, I purchased an amazon return and found no problems with it. Dont be afraid to purchase a used one for less, you can always return it if it is actually broken, but it will probably work anyway)

  I purchased this product for my daughter whom had lost most of her possessions in a move.  We wanted to replace her record player but didn't want to spend a ton of money.  The reviews were ok so we decided to drop the 50 dollars for this player.  The color is super vibrant.  The player itself is a pretty good.  It has blue tooth capability.  Which is pretty great.  The sound through the speakers is fine for what it is.  It is not the best player but for the money it works well.  We can hear it fairly well in the bedroom.  The packaging was TERRIBLE.  They just shipped in the original box, I would of liked to have seen it packaged a bit  better with some wrap around it inside another box.  I didn't expect it to work to be honest.  The box looked beat up a bit.  But in the end it works and over all happy with the product.I give this a 4 Star.* 1 star (Nope, DO NOT LIKE IT AT ALL!): I would either return or throw away this product. It was a waste of my money and not functional. I will never order again.** 2 star (Think twice before buying - don't like it): I'm not a fan of this item and I won't order it again, but it has at least one positive quality.*** 3 star (It’s ok): This item has both positive and negative qualities. It may work for some people, but I wouldn't go out of my way to purchase or recommend it.**** 4 star (I like it): This item arrived and functions as advertised. I would change a few things about this (including pricing), but is a good product overall. I would use this item.***** 5 star (I love it!): This item is AWESOME. I will use it and recommend it to others! I just LOVE it! It works as advertised and is an all-around great product.All of my reviews are written with the hope of helping other Amazon customers make the right buying decisions for themselves. To help increase awareness of a particular product it might be positive or negative, but in the end it is honest. Thank you for reading my review. I hope it has helped you.

  We have had issues with both the units we purchased. this is Victrolas answer to our units skipping right out of the box.

So diamond needle or any other type of needles are compatible with our turntables.If the unit still does not work, please have the unit returned to the retailer for a replacement/exchange.Regards,SamCustomer SupportVICTROLA1 Channel Drive, Port Washington, NY 11050Support: +1(877) 483-2497 (toll free)So I figured i would give these a try. the sound improved and the records DID NOT skip.

  I spent 3 weeks looking at reviews, unboxings, opinion pieces. I got exactly what I wanted for the best price. If you're willing to spend $400 on a pair of audiophile headphones, this isn't for you. If you are cool with the sound quality coming off your phone but louder this is for you.Pros: The top of the case doesn't run on your records. It's cheap compared to every other record player with the same damn components. It has auto stop, Bluetooth, line-in.Cons: the reason it sounds ""bad"" is because the case is open, use a smaller record and close the lid and you'll hear the difference...or just get some cheap ass speakers if you really care that much.PS: the reason everyone complains about these suitcase record players and they say they sound bad is because they know nothing about RECORDS they don't know that dust gets on them and they get charged with static.. just wash the damn things you fools and stop putting your finger all over them, they'll sound miles better.

    Why Vinyl Is STILL BETTER Than Digital
  
",5.0,MooreNoLess,"Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2017","









  
  
    
  Measuring about the size of a small 10 to 14-inch laptop PC, but 5 inches deep, this is the perfect portable and stowaway companion for my 40-plus years of LPs. Yes, it also sounds just right through the two small front facing stereo speakers. This Victrola is also a bigger eargasm when using my larger stereo speakers or extra-bass headphones. To use my medium sized Bluetooth speakers, I will soon buy a RCA cable Bluetooth transmitter for the turntable's RCA output connector on the back.The build and sound quality reminds me so much like the portable album and ""45"" players we had for pop-up parties at school or hang-outs at a girlfriend's house. Yet, it's almost as light as my small laptop PC. This was truly a great buy that I will get a lot of regular use from playing all my ""33s"" and ""45s"" again, and buying some current artists on vinyl. Even my Dad's surviving ""78s"" also sound awesome, but are rough on the easily replaceable stylus.Trust this for certain, uncompressed analog audio sounds much fuller and impressive than the compressed digital sound we've gotten used to over the last 25 years. Don't believe it? Well, you'll hear the same distinct similarities that those mostly ""old head"" jurors heard and knew when listening to the Blurred Lines song (Pharrell and Thicke) while clearly remembering the sounds from Marvin Gayes' worldwide 1977 hit and party jam, Got to Give It Up. ""Old head"" ears (like me) are more attuned to hearing a much fuller spectrum of sounds, ranges and rhythms than people who have only listened to compressed digitized music. Simply, it just sounds more full, real and live.Even the price on this 3-speed stereo turntable was under $50 perfect. It's well worth buying for all those middle and subtle sounds I've been missing in my music and comedy albums. Buy this Victrola portable record player, and FINALLY get your 21st century musical head and ears right --- at a low cost. Your mind, body, soul and ears will thank you.

  My most recent purchase was the second player I had ordered. The first player did not work straight out of the box. No phono, no line-in, no Bluetooth, no sound. Nothing. I purchased another one and it actually played for about 30 minutes before it stopped working too. I thought it had perhaps come with a faulty AC adapter but I tried another one and still, nothing.Wait. I thought I heard some static coming from those speakers! Great! Nope. Never mind. It stopped working again. Ugh.I love the look and the portability but I am a bit of a utilitarian. I don’t want to carry around a neat little box for no discernible reason. It needs to have some sort of function and unfortunately it’s not heavy enough to use as a door stop.

  I wasn't expecting much as far as the built in speakers, as I expected it is poor quality, but when you plug in your own speakers the quality doesn't get much better.

   Like that its compact and comes with adapter to play 45's.  Red and white rca outputs in back. I'll plug into a mixer then the skies the limit once I get the replacement. Plugged a bluetooth transmitter into headphone jack then paired with Amazon Echo. Be sure to play last song till the end on all size records as 'auto off' feature can be defective as shown in video.  Built in Bluetooth is a receiver not a transmitter and worked perfectly.  Built in speakers worked perfectly.  ALL manufacturers sometimes produce lemons.

  First one came and didn't work at all.  So we returned and ordered another.  The next one worked for about 3 days, then the arm stopped working properly.  Now the arm won't electronically move.  You have to manually move it and set in on the record, which is dangerous because you could accidentally scratch the record that way.  So we are returning the second one, because we are afraid if we keep it we will scratch our records and worse, something else will go wrong with the player after the window to return it closes.  To say I am disappointed is an understatement.  I love all things British and bought the British flag design, and it's been since the late 80's/early 90's since I operated a record player.  The thrill of putting on a record was unsurpassed, for the whole day I used it.  I now have to use my husband's record player and not have my own.  Really mad about this purchase, it's cheap and crappy.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING UNLESS YOU ENJOY RETURNING THINGS MULTIPLE TIMES!!

  This 3 Speed Victrola portable record player arrived in a box that was not taped shut. That was my first clue that this could to be a ""return"" that got sent out as good merchandise. I hope! When I opened the box the power supply cord was tossed loosely on top of the player with the twist tie undone, the cord was not even nicely wrapped up! I took the player out of the box and removed the Styrofoam protectors and undid the latch and open the player to discover that the plastic needle protector that was so suppose to be on the needle (to be removed before playing a record) was missing, another clued that this could be a return that got passed on to me! Then I discovered that the drive belt was lose and hanging out from beneath the turntable! Okay, I figured that I could reattach it around the turntable and then around the drive shaft and I did so and was successful. Next I connected the power supply and turned the power knob, the turntable spun! So I obtained one of my old LP's and placed it on the turntable and settled the needle down gently upon it (using the needle arm control) and the record started off fine, the sound was perfect and then the sound stopped! I turned the player off and then turned it on again, still no sound coming from the speakers. Well, I'm not that disappointed because anytime you purchase electronics from Amazon, it's going to be a gamble. So, I will be returning this item as usual.

  I'm happy with this little record player, it's exactly what I expected. It's not high-end, the speakers aren't the best, but its imperfections add to the vintage sounding experience I wanted from a record player. Plays my old records fine (vintage Beatles, Elvis, etc), as well as my new. It has jacks on the back that I'm sure would allow me to hook it up to my stereo if I decide to go for a bigger sound at some point.The turn table has a wobble to it, but I don't ever remember owning one that didn't. Arm seems weighted fine, no need to tape a penny to it like the one I had back in the day.

  Listen, if you wanna buy your youngster their first turntable so they can occasionally put one or two records on just for the novelty then this is the one for you. If your serious about music and like to hear the mids, bass and treble in crystal clear, awesome quality, skip this for sure! I bought this after reading some obviously paid reviews thinking I could plug in some computer speakers with a sub woofer and get some awesome sound, I was dead wrong. The horrible noise that comes out of this thing would be compatible to listening to a 8kbps MP3 playing through an old Nokia cellphone but much louder and tinnier. :(I'm dead-serious, if you buy this thing, DO NOT expect any sort of quality audio from it. Speakers won't save it, changing the stylus won't help, cleaning all of your records like a nut won't help... It's like a little novelty toy turntable and that's it. It looks awesome, super portable and neat to look at but sounds like absolute trash. After 2 days I returned it and spent my money on an Audio Technica LP60X. About 2000x better, sounds amazing, has better features and you can plug anything into it. Works like a charm! Spend the extra $50 and save yourself the trouble. You'll thank me later.

  Do not buy this!! I don’t have much experience with record players but I know enough to know that the sound quality is 100% garbage. It sounds as if the needle is scratching the records, and the speakers are busted. Not only is the sound bad, if you look at the record being played, you’ll see it’s actually warping your vinyl. This is the worst purchase I’ve ever made and will be retuning it. Update: I returned this item on the 14th of this month and never received my refund. When I contacted Amazon, they said they had refunded me and tried to pass the blame to my bank. The refund has still not been received nearly two weeks later.

  I was hopeful. With a mix of good and bad reviews, I was hopeful that maybe for some it just wasn't up to their standard and they were expecting a quality similar to a $200+ turntable.Once I opened this up and had a look at it, I quickly realized why this is a $40-$60 turntable.The entire top panel that contains the nobs and switches is a cheap looking plastic. This includes the platter, luckily there are soft rubber parts of the platter to keep the record in place. All of this was sort of expected for the price.After placing a record on and lowering the needle, the most shocking thing about this product forced its way into my ears... The sound of this product is A B S O L U T E L Y horrible. Some reviews mention no bass, but i wasnt expecting NO bass at all. The sound from this sound like the cheapest speakers they could have possibly placed in this. Theyre like the type of speakers that would be on a fast food kids meal toy.I dont know if I got a bad egg, but I cannot believe that anyone thinks that this is good quality sound unless they've been paid or reimbursed to review the product, or have never used anything other than cheap speakers.I honestly believe i could go find better sounding speakers at the dollar store.This of course is not the end of the world. I just grabbed another bluetooth speaker that I had and plugged in an aux chord and that resolved the speaker issue.In addition to the cheap speakers, the platter wobbles quite a bit. And on top of that, one of the rubber spots on the platter was lower than the others, making the record wobble even more. So the sound of the music was very unstable and was very warped sounding.I managed to partially resolve this by placing a few pieces of electrical tape on top of the lower rubber piece.For anyone looking for a beginner record player. This would be it. But dont expect miracles.Will be returning to hopefully get a better version of this product and will update my rating if it is indeed betted.

Long story short, ended up taking it apart and finding the speakers not even plugged in. But wait, it gets better. The rubber band like belt that turns the table wasn’t even on. There was electrical plugs not even plugged in. After a little messing with it, finally got it to work. Speakers suck, but you can always buy new ones. Works fine now.

   Decent record player. Definitely not high quality speakers. Kind of tingy with absolutely no bass. All treble. That was disappointing. If I turn it up louder it just gets worse. The quality I paid for I guess though. Besides being cheaply made it looks cool and does what it’s supposed to. I showed some of the features in my video as far as stopping a song, volume, and speeding up the record.

It is really cute, but the sound is pretty bad from the getgo.  Then after the third use, the speed started messing up and began warping the records.  Fortunately, I was within the 30 day return period and sent it back.  It's disappointing because she was so excited when it arrived.

  This is my first time owning a turntable, born in the late 80s. I don’t know what I was thinking purchasing something with included speakers - a huge mistake. Even cleaning and deep cleaning a new vinyl didn’t stop it from skipping every 15 seconds. It’s not very loud and the sound is crappy. I am not an audiophile, but I should’ve known bare minimum money would produce a bare minimum product. This is only for people that want a device to just listen to the songs, not get lost in the songs. Clearly I need separate speakers for that. Yeah it’s more money but???? If I’m gonna invest money at all.. it won’t be for this piece of crap.

  I had taken my wife for a date night away from the kids, and the place we stayed at had a similar record player (Crosley Cruiser).  We enjoyed it so much, I decided to get this to surprise her.  The first time I used it, it skipped terribly on a new vinyl, causing some permanent damage to the beginning of it.  Bummer.  When I calmed down, I decided to change out the needle with the extra one included with the player.  Viola!  It then played to my expectations, which were not too high.  The sound is a bit tinny, but that is actually what makes it more endearing, along with the retro look.  I contacted Victrola via email, and the same day they said they were sending out a replacement needle for the one that was originally installed.  I don't plan to use the bluetooth function, so I can't attest to that, but I did hook it up to a soundbar successfully using rca cables.  Overall, if you don't plan to start a huge collection and if you aren't concerned about top notch sound, you won't find better for the price.  And if you like to open some wine and have a romantic evening at home every once in awhile, this thing is great.

  So very disappointed to have to give this one star. First of all, I had to wait 2 months for it to arrive. When it got here, I was so excited! It is absolutely adorable, the color was perfect, and it was just what I wanted. Except that it doesn't play a record for more than 30 seconds before it starts skipping. I tried it in several different locations -  hoping maybe it just needed a REALLY flat surface...didn't matter. The sound quality from what I could tell seems ok. I had read a bunch of reviews, both good and bad, and thought there were so many great reviews, I'd risk it. Unfortunately, I got one that seems to have the same skipping issue as a lot of other folks. I'm not saying don't order it (if mine had worked, I'd be giving it at least 4 stars) just buyer beware that yours might be one of the ones that don't work. Sending it back.

  I loved the idea of this product. I bought this for my 4 year old for Christmas.  It was and still is his favorite thing.  Seeing his love for vinyl records and music in general is one of my favorite experiences in life.  I could never return it for that reason alone.That being said, from a technical standpoint, the build quality is really bad. Right out of the box, I noticed that the turntable itself isn't mounted properly on its base. Almost like it's warped or something. The tone arm is super loose and makes it a bit tough to position it where you want it.At the end of the day, it's a gift that my 4 year old loves more than anything.  However, if I'd known that the build quality was going to be so poor before I bought it, I would have passed for something better.

   Let’s start with the number one issue with this record player: the speakers on it suck. They suck bad. They sound awful and I was so disappointed when I first played it because I thought vinyl was supposed to sound good. However, that being said, the record player is excellent if you connect it to a good speaker system. And for the price, I don’t think you can expect much more. I’ll tell you why I decided to keep it, because it’s damn cute.I got the one with the British flag cover and it’s a-dor-a-ble!  I mean I really wanted a retro looking record player and this is spot on. Once I connected it to my Kikburn speaker via an auxiliary cable (not included) I was thrilled.In the end I ended up connecting it to a block rocker max system that I wasn’t getting much use out of except for parties and I’m very happy with the results.I’m a little concerned that you cannot close the cover while playing you records because I have young kids and I’m nervous that they will bump in to it while playing, but I do think it would add considerable bulk to the unit, so I’m not sure I’d actually choose to change that.The auto stop feature is great and pretty much necessary. It’s a bit pointless that it has the option to turn it off because I don’t see why you’d ever want to turn it off.The soft needle drop function is also very convenient and makes playing records extremely easy for anyone.And again, the look of it is just so darn cute, I can’t bring myself to return it for one that say, has a cover or a better speaker etc. Over all for the price I think it’s great. I’m very happy with it, but just know you absolutely will need external speakers to go with your adorable record player.

  This little record player is fantastic and has returned me to the joys of collecting and playing vinyl LPs. It is sturdy, has a small footprint and very simple to use. Highly portable but I have mine in one place and have connected  nicer speakers via the RCA jacks on the back. It comes with pretty good dynamic range speakers built into the cabinet but you are not going to get the full sounds that you probably want unless you hook up other speakers and a sub woofer. I bought the Logictec Z323 system for mine and I now feel like I have the best stereo system I could ever want. Rich, warm sound and thanks to the huge number of cheap, old LPs out there, I have access to music that either never made it to CDs or is too expensive.

NOW, Victrola does make one that allows you to play your records on an external bluetooth speaker unlike this one. I purchased another so I sent this back.

",1.0,B Fam,"Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  We bought this for a teenager that was super excited about getting into the retro vinyl vibe. Super excited when she opened it until we played our first record...Initially, we thought we had purchased records that were warped, as the newer vinyl (Harry Styles in particular...sorry Harry🤓) kept skipping, but found the culprit after a lot of googling, which revealed similar complaints about this record player: improper weight and balance to the tone arm (for those like me that aren't audiophiles, translation: the needle isn't pressing down hard enough to hold in the record groove, so it skips in certain spots). As I did more research, this seems to be more of an issue with newer records in particular-maybe due to the way they are produced. Several of the newer records we bought actually could be seen wobbling slightly up and down on the player as it turned (I now see that in several video reviews). If you really like the look and are determined to buy this, the ""fix"" is to add a small amount of weight above the needle. We added a penny right above the needle to test (apparently this was a fix in the old days when records skipped) and YEAH!!! immediately eliminated skipping on all records for us. The new issue: you are now potentially adding too much weight and therefore wearing out your record faster (as well as a penny that may fall off ocassionally. Bottom line, I would suggest passing on this and look for a record player that has a better balanced arm, or better yet, spend a little extra money and buy a player with an adjustable tone arm (which you set to a specific gram weight to hold the needle down). Rock on Harry!

  This summer I enlisted the help of my two granddaughters ages 10 and 13 to help me catalog a large amount of records left to me by my deceased mother and father. Among the records were 33's from the 60's 70's and 80's and 78's from the 50'ss and older. The girls were completely amazed with the ""giant CD's"". When they wanted to hear them I no longer had anything to play them on. As I told them things about the Artists I knew and the times I had grown up in we found most songs on the internet so they could hear the records they were cataloging. How thrilled they were to hear the long  ago songs and the voices of the dead that will forever live. I had offered to pay them for the hours of work they were doing to help me on the project and instead they wanted this  record player and a few of the Albums. I was all too happy to oblige them. It arrived in perfect shape and on time. The kids were so excited to hear the first album played...It was the Sound of Music. It has continued to work well. Note..On newer Albums purchased today the ""Vinyl"" is a little different and you may need to put a coin on the tone arm to make it a little heavier so it doesn't skip. There has been no trouble at all with the olderalbums.

   If you rarely play records or are not much of Vinyl collector, then sure it's probably alright. It comes with everything you need to turn on and play records. And it's as portable as a record player can be.But the record player is poorly designed and records will wobble quote a bit. If you buy a lot of records, you'll eventually come across a record that skips a lot or the sound sounds warped, even though the record is fine.So a good record player for the rare Vinyl listener, or someone who wants to see if it's something that will even gain their interest.But if you want to build a Vinyl collection, and keep your records in the best shape, you'll probably need to buy a more costly record player. Or look into and buy attachments that will help protect the records or get them to play better on this one, if that is even a possibility.So I'd only recommend it if you really want the portablility, or of you just want something cheap and affordable, and aren't worried about potential warping or damage to a Vinyl over time due to poor design of this player.

However, upon receiving it: the unit was not only faulty, it also damaged two irreplaceable records of mine! I was so furious, I immediately asked for a return. At this point I was just looking for something that would be a reliable backup for the time being and after I fix my Sony.Pros: this thing is reliable as hellIt has a ton of very intuitive featuresThe arm is manually operated (no more auto arm failures!)And it has an auto stop feature.All of the cables are replaceable! I use gold RCA cables for sound qualityIt’s portable!Cons:the needles it comes with aren’t great but they’re just as good as AudioTechnica’s needles. I was able to find an elliptical needle that’s compatible on a bidding website for under $12 and the sound quality is even better than units costing 4x as much.PS: it looks way more classy and timeless in person than it does in the pictures (I got the black version)So, whether you’re a beginner or an enthusiast, I highly recommend this item. And I highly recommend getting an elliptical needle to replace the stock one!Also, you will want to cut out some felt to put on the turntable under your records, just to be safe.

  Love this record player, it looks great in a room pretty enough to be decor and it sounds great. I’ve received so many compliments from friends and neighbors who all want to buy there own. Speaking of price it’s such good quality for such a low price It’s really easy to use, the bluetooth works great i love being able to play Pandora from my phone when I don’t want to listen to one of my records I also enjoy playing podcasts on it while I cook dinner. It’s portablility is another great feature we like to sit on our back deck and listen to music while watchin the sunset. The white/gold is beautiful the gold really stands out and goes with my decor vintage decor it doesn’t look cheap at all only downfall is that the inside is like a velvet and I know its going to get dirty from any lil speck of dust and idk how I plan on cleaning it when it does, it’s nice to be able to close the lid to keep that from happening it came with a couple small marks n spots on it being that it’s white u can see very detail and I notice everything I definitely would not buy white again. I think the player gets loud enough I can hear it very well in other rooms but my husbands would prefer to get some other speakers for when we want it even louder

Seller Refund was quick, seller has yet to even send a return label after months of asking for one so I basically got a free paper weight!Cons- took weeks to arrive. Sound quality is terrible -ran mine Via the rca jacks into my surround sound and also the actual built in speakers are absolutely horrible. Still have it in box in garage after I got refund from seller. No return label sent so it’s now Taking up precious space.

  I bought this as a gift for my niece for Christmas. Since I wanted to leave some sort of review I took it out of the box to check for functionality and repacked it to wrap for her. The record player comes very well packaged and has many layers of styrofoam to keep it from breaking. The needle inside is also very well protected with wrappings. The power came on and it appeared to function just fine. It also comes with a handle that makes it super east to carry around from place to place.I have since asked my niece if she liked the sound and she said it works and sounds great, and loves playing her records on it. She hasn’t used the Bluetooth option yet, not even sure she ever will, but I guess it’s a nice feature for those that will use it.

   I have zero experience with records or record players. I love everything retro, and I got sick of buying all my music digital (even if it’s convenient!) so I thought why not try out a record player? This was the right price and a pretty color, so I went for it and picked up an Amy Winehouse album at my local Half Price Books. I’m blown away! I had it running in less than 5 minutes and the sound is awesome, no extra speakers needed (I’m just listening to it in my living room). I absolutely recommend for anyone new to vinyl albums. I’ve attached a video and a picture to give you a nice view :)Edit: the turntable on this is wobbly. It's not an even turn, I can notice that the records are unevenly spinning when I view it from the side where I sit on my couch. It doesn't appear to affect the music (that I'm aware of, I don't know what's normal vinyl variance and what isn't) but it's really annoying to see and I'm knocking off a star for it.

    The Day The Music Died

  Our teenage daughter (who is really an 80s child at heart) loved the cool designs of the Victrola Record Player.  Unfortunately this record player seems to be a very poor quality.  We bought our first one at Kohl""s and it was this year's Christmas present.  After opening it we realized it was missing its needle.  We bought replacement needles on Amazon and tried again.  With the new needle in place we spun a record. OMG! The speakers were horrible.  They played very softly and the volume knob did nothing.  We returned it to Kohl's.After getting home, we went on Amazon Smile (everybody should shop via Smile and support a charity such as The Multiple System Atrophy Coalition)).  The reviews on the Victrola were among the best so we decided to give it another try, assuming the first one from Kohl's was a dud.The new vintage Victrola Record Player arrived quickly. Our daughter was so excited. We unpackaged it and checked the needle. It was there! We put on a record and turned it on.  The music came on at a nice sound level. The first verse was perfect.  But then...... the record started skipping.  We tried a brand new record. More skipping. We could not get a record to play well.  We turned it off and the music died.Two busts and we were done.  We returned it hassle free and bought a different brand (similar style). The new record player sounds great and the same records that skipped on the Victrola Record Player play perfectly on our new brand.Maybe we just got two duds, but we just don't trust the quality and are glad we moved on.

  Nice while it lasted, but after a few months, with very little use, it simply will not turn on.  In fact I was using it, turned it off for a bit while I was doing something else, came back and turned it on - nothing.  I do have an electronics background - the power supply is fine and power is making it to the main board but that's it, there is no power making it to the platter control board.  There are no obvious signs of any shorts or burnt out components and since everything besides the capacitors are sub-miniature components any further home repair is not an option.You get what you pay for and this appears to be a hit or miss product - you'll either get one that keeps working or you'll get one that dies shortly after arrival.  Go ahead, spin the wheel!!  No, I would not recommend this product.PS:  Due to other reviews mentioning problems with the electronics I highly recommend you DO NOT leave this plugged in when not in use.

    Faulty AC/DC adapter but simple fix with possibility of battery portability!
  
",3.0,TX Jeeper,"Reviewed in the United States March 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  It's a mixed bag... If you're industrious and patient this record player offers great bang for your buck. If you are looking for something perfect, this isn't it... but keep in mind additional cost doesn't necessarily mean better quality.BAD:1. Quality- Like others have mentioned the AC/DC adapters that come with these record players seem to have a very high failure rate. My adapter failed after 10 mins of use, so it seems if you received a bad unit you'll know pretty quickly. The seller/mfg seems to stand behind the failure and my replacement is in route to me at this moment, BUT I'm sure it can be frustrating to many expecting initial problem-free use.2. Sound - With only 10 watts of power and small speakers you're not going to blow anyone away with a ""wall of sound"" but it performs adequately with realistic expectations.Input - Not horrible, but worth noting this for devices already sending powered audio. If you're hoping to plug in an unpowered mic you are likely going to be disappointed.THE GOOD:1. Simplicity - If a there was a ""best-case scenario"" component to fail on this product -  the AC/DC adapter is it. The record player is powered by a 5V/1A AC/DC power supply that is plugs into the back via a 5.4MM X 10MM barrel plug. The plug is center positive, which is typical. These can easily be found as part of a universal AC/DC set. I keep a couple spare universal AC/DC adapters on hand for just such occurrence.  The low power requirements needed to run this player and generic power plug make it a great candidate for using portable power. I WAS SUCCESSFUL powering the device reliably using a portable cellphone battery backup. TO DO THIS- you need a battery that's rated to produce 2.1A or more (although 2.1A is more than player needs, battery amperage rating is theoretical max) and a USB cable (NOT INCLUDED) that has USB A (male) on one end and the barrel power tip on the other. Amazon DOES sell these and I would highly recommend this since you could also use a standard USB phone/tablet AC adapter in a pinch. A PC or Laptop WILL NOT provide adequate power via USB.2. Portability - Device is pretty light. Easily carried by adult or child. The possibility using portable power make the portability option even better.3. Value -  For the price it's hard to go wrong... essentially 3 devices in 1... Record player, BT Speaker, wired speaker.

  I love this record player and would give it a much better rating, except that it arrived without the 45 adapter.

  Was looking for an inexpensive, portable turntable with ability to hook up to bluetooth and other speakers. The VST was cute (black velvet, old timey look) and portable (easy to tote briefcase style). Also nice to have LP/45/78 options. Was excited until actually played some LPs, a couple of 45s and even an old 79.  The sound quality is very tinny (compared to older standalone turntables owned over time) - whether this is speaker or needle quality or both is conjecture. Although noted as ""bluetooth"" cannot be connected to wireless BT speaker. Tried regular BOSE small speakers which increased volume but accented poor sound quality; the headphone jack was loose internally so the speaker connection came and went. Wanted to really like this item but think for the price the quality was disappointing.

  This thing skips over the most minor dust particles and it’s really really annoying, especially considering you can’t close it with the record inside which means while you play the record more dust or hair has a chance of falling on it and makes it skip a ton. I’ve wiped every record down before playing and they still skip if there’s even one hint of dust. The bluetooth part is nice but definitely not worth the price if you’re trying to just play records. Complete waste of money.

    A 33 record rubs against the case and slows the record down
  
",3.0,Deena Ramthun,"Reviewed in the United States October 30, 2018","









  
  
    
  The look of it is really cute. Looks great on our dining room table. The PROBLEM is this:When you put on a standard 33 record, the way the top case sits, the record rubs against the velvet insides of the case. Because of this rub the record slows down and sounds a little distorted.We managed to fix it by putting the 45 converter piece UNDER the 33 to lift it up a little bit. That lead to the slight issue of the piece slipping and losing traction under the weight of the 33 record,  so we put a little piece of double sided tape under the piece so it held its traction. So now it technically works, but we had to make our own workaround.

That is fine as I wasn't planning on hooking up additional speakers anyway. It arrived and the packaging wasn't just damaged, it was open with no tape to hold it closed whatsoever. Weird. Also, not just the output cord was missing. The power cord is missing, the extra needle is missing and there was no paperwork (instructions\warranty) at all. Luckily, I had a power cord from something else that works. The record player operates fine. The sound is what is expected from an inexpensive unit. However, it is annoying that the accessories are missing. Them being included is what made this seem like a great bargain. Without them, not so much.

Thanks for that Amazon, but I now have to figure out how to get my ""free"" player to work. I ordered an after market power supply for it and it worked perfectly. I am happy with the player, it works great, and I can now listen to my classic recordings the way they were meant to be heard. The built-in speakers aren't anything to write home about though. Please connect it via RCA plugs to your music system or get some powered speakers. I didn't rate the Bluetooth capability on this because I haven't tested it, and will probably not use it anyway. Is this for ""beginners?"" maybe, but it works exactly like the classic record players of old, so if you're a younger person and have never used one, read up on it and/or get an older fella like me to help you.

",3.0,B. Robinson,"Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  Out of the box, this record player was limited in the records it could play. I attempted to play records by Amy Winehouse, Radiohead, and Ariana Grande, but all of them skipped horribly. I was able to play a few classic albums (Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart Band and Kind of Blue) as well as an album by a now defunct local band. When looking through reviews, I found that some people had to replace the needle to something higher quality than the one that comes with the player and that fixed the issues. I ordered some new tips and now the records are all playing without skipping. They are pretty easy to replace. The sound quality from the player is horrible, but i expected that and i have been using my own speaker. The playback is dynamic though at times it distorts a tiny but with some records, especially at louder parts. It really is only a tiny but distorted,  if I were an audiophile I would probably hate it but it's not enough to bother an amateur like myself.  But honestly I got what I expected:  a cute but practical decoration that would hold me off as far as records go until I can find a higher quality player that adds to my home's aesthetic.As far as appearance goes, I got the light blue player and it looks exactly like it did in the picture. It is a cute addition to my home office that helps the space feel more relaxing and provides a nice color pop to the room.

  Bought this as my very first Vinyl Record Player Experience. I guess that I just expected too much for the price.The build of the item itself is plastic, so it is lightweight, as expected and is rather convenient for portability. The tonearm and needle are rather flimsy and the plate that you lay the records on is also made of a cheap plastic.I did however expect it to work with integrated or removable batteries, considering that it does have a suitcase form factor to allow it to be more portable. You are forced to use the included power supply.Now regarding to the main functions of the device: The Included Speakers are BAD, and I mean really bad. There is no depth in them, whatsoever and the overall distortion makes it impossible to enjoy.The player suffered from frequent skipping, which initially seemed to be the LP's fault, but after playing back a few more records, it became clear that the tonearm and needle are too light to apply the needed force to avoid such a problem. I stopped using this product immediately after realizing this.To set the icing on the cake, it died on me a few weeks ago... I guess I'll be switching to Sony's newest PS-LX310BT Belt Drive Turntable that is much better built and has a great minimalist design. They're pros when it comes to the good old Record Players and Vinyls!RESUMED: Save up some more cash and go with something that cost $200 or more. Anything else just isn't worth it.

  Want to make  your LPs sound terrible? Then this is your device. Streaming MP3 through your iPhone's mono speaker sounds better.When a quality entry level stand-alone record player costs $150, what do you think you'll get for $40 when the device also packages in a headphone amp, tiny little speakers, and Bluetooth? You get a real crappy sounding, warbly sounding record player with horrible, horrible, all-treble, no-bass sound. Oddly, MP3 streamed into the device via Bluetooth sounds way better than the LPs which points to something horribly wrong with the record player portion of the unit I received.

  I ordered this as I've had a much larger, higher-quality RCA cabinet in the past that my dad sold out from under me. Finally was able to get back into vinyl after years of wanting too, so I picked this little player up as a good starter. Victrola has always been a bit of a budget player, so this fits their usual build.It's very much a basic, starter player. It does have Bluetooth, which is a nice feature. The headphone and line in/out with RCA hookups were a nice touch. Once I finally manage to find the same cabinet I had before, I'll likely move on from this one. But it makes a decent bookshelf player. The speakers are tinny, but aren't awful for their size. Would recommend Singing Wood speakers with RCA if you're on a budget, and RCA vintage wood housed speakers if you're willing to do some leg work and Edifier/Bose if you have enough to shell out. Even with the tinny speakers; it still flat out beats MP3 quality.For some reason, the player works just fine with all of my LPs, except for my new copy of David Bowie's ""No Plan."" I checked and the vinyl is pressed flat, not any thicker or thinner than Bon Iver, Flogging Molly, etc. Taped two pennies to the top of the needle for a little extra weight and that did the trick. Otherwise, without the additional weight ""No Plan"" keeps skipping.Purchased some additional replacement needles and will grab a cleaning kit in a bit. Works like a dream with the wooden over-ear Victrola Bluetooth headphones. Would recommend using them with their headphone jack if you want the best sound quality.

  I ordered one of these players. When it came the UPS box was fine, but the Victrola box inside had a huge hole in it. However the packaging inside the Victrola box looked okay so I went with it. At first every record I played skipped. This was my first record player so I thought it was the records and not the player that was the problem. There were tears, I was so heartbroken. The player came with an extra needle, so after every record constantly skipped I tried the other needle. That helped, but the records still skipped some of the time. I finally taped a penny to the top of the arm where the needle was and the records stopped skipping. But I thought the record player shouldn't need all of these changes to work right, so I asked for a replacement from Amazon. Worst case scenario, I'd send the new one back and live with my ""penny player"". The new player came in a different box, no damage to the box. The new player works perfectly. No new needle needed, no pennies either. And every record plays perfectly now with no skipping. The second player is a nice one, easy to use and understand and the sound is excellent. I find myself listening to records all of the time now, and can see myself falling down the vinyl rabbit hole. I look forward someday to having a corner of my home with a beautiful sound system in it including a record player. I registered my first player (the damaged one) with Victrola, and they sent me a free needle as a welcome gift. That was nice. They seem like a quality company. First record player aside, I give the product four stars. I'm happy with it.

  This is one of the most textbook cases of false advertising I've ever seen. Had I read the reviews before purchasing I wouldn't have bought this. Came with no power cord, and when I finally went out and bought a replacement cord of the exact type and plugged it in, the player started making unholy screeching noises and reeked of burnt plastic until unplugged, then completely stopped working. This was all in the span of a day. :( Very disappointed since I had been looking forward to receiving the package for weeks.

  My mom LOVED this record player! She has collected records for years and my siblings and I grew up listening to records... since then she no longer had one so I was happy to get her this one for Christmas and she was thrilled and played it right away. Being a modern woman she also uses Bluetooth now so she was surprised she could do both on this beautiful record player. This has now taken center stage in her bedroom and she uses it every day.

   I just got this delivered today. The kids and I opened it immediately. We love it. Of course they didn’t know what it was...but once I showed it to them and played a record on it, they thought it was pretty cool. The overall product is great. It has a nice look to it. It is very easy to operate. The sound quality is pretty good. It turns up loud and it plays music just as loud if not louder than music plays on my phone and tablets. So I’m satisfied with that. The sound is clear and it’s just fun to be able to pull out records from my childhood and play for my kids. Great record player for the price. It’s cute to look at and doesn’t take up a lot of space.

  I bought this for the tune of $27.00 for a like new item, and pink camo was the cheapest, so I decided to man up and not pay more for red, or green. The lift arm has a nice glide over feature, and sit on a crib separate from the record plate. I used a mat to create more space for some of my wobblier records. The simple interface ON is also the volume knob, you have a second for phono, line in, and Bluetooth. I tested the Bluetooth this works with my computer, but I don't own by choice a cellphone so can't advise you on that item. This player has a brighter tone, that at first I was like where is the bass, but then you hear the full range of instruments and / or vocals all at the same time. Victrola is a name you can get behind, as the style, price, form, tone, and overall sound is really good. Originally I noticed significantly less lower tones, but more middle and upper tones, and I thought because my other mono system used one really large speaker. You would then naturally get lower tones, however when using my over the ear headphones, I notices the same sound, more high and mid-tones. So I am not sure this has anything to do with the speaker system, as the sound very bass heavy when plugging them into the computer. I tested all sorts of music on this player, Classical a Golden Tone record that really had dynamics. 80's,70's,60's music, techno, classic country, pop, rock, electronic, singer song writer. I would like to hear what 80's rap sounds like on this machine, everything you put on this sounds nice, and you can hear it at low volume, far away from the unit. What played the best Brazil 66, Naked Eye's, Strauss Waltz, Heart.

  I like the suitcase design and the flexibility to play 78, 33 & 45 records. The auto stop feature is nice. The speakers aren’t to the quality I would want but I knew that before I bought it and have a Bose blue tooth speaker. My biggest complaint has to do with the blue tooth capability. I thought I would be able to connect my speaker to the record player wirelessly. Turns out the blue tooth only works as an input to the players speakers not as an output to an external speaker making the blue tooth function useless (being that the I would never want to use the speakers in the player). But since I will rarely move the player and can plug in the nose speaker manually it is a minor complaint. Overall I am please with it and would buy it again.

  It took me a year to get into vinyl because I was afraid that I wouldn't get the right products or I wouldn't be prepared to have a collection. While this was true and it was expensive to get started, I have found that this record player is perfectly suitable for people just starting out and even more so for people who aren't concerned with collecting and keeping quality on records.If you just want to experience vinyl at a cheaper price this works just fine. There is some concern that it is damaging my records, but I've also found that people who talk about vinyl's tend to have very personalized ideas of what constitutes good record maintenance and I'm just fixing my process myself as I go along. I will say that something about it seems to be off balance? Sometimes a record just wont play right without adjustments. Otherwise it works fine.

  I haven't had a record player in about 30 years, so I was looking forward to digging my old vinyl out of the closet without spending a ton of money on an expensive player. I'm not so disappointed in this one that I intend to return it, but it does leave a lot to be desired.Likes: The sound quality is very good considering the price and considering that it has tiny speakers. The whole player is smaller than I thought it would be. It's very compact, and it plays my records well. The rotation on my unit is smooth, not wobbly as others have reported.Dislikes: There are two modes of powering on the turntable. In the first, the turntable comes on whenever the stylus is moved from its holder toward the edge of the record. Unfortunately, in that mode, the table is supposed to turn off when the record is finished playing. My unit turns off with about 30 seconds of music left -- extremely annoying. Imagine pulling the power cord out of the wall and hearing the music slooow down and stop.In the second mode, the table keeps turning no matter what. That means you can't walk off and forget it with a record playing, or you'll come back to a worn-out needle.I guess I was expecting the type of record player we had back before compact disks -- one that would mechanically return the stylus to its holder when the record finished. No such luck, and I'm disappointed that I have to pay so much attention to turning the unit on and off. Oh, well, you get what you pay for. At least I have something to play my records on, even if I do have to get up at the end of each 45 and fiddle with the player.

  I’ve been an amazon prime customer for around 8 or so years. Maybe even 10. I’ve never returned something before, until now. This thing is utter garbage. I’m new to the vinyl scene, and thought this would be a good entry-level buy. I was wrong. I got it yesterday, but didn’t have any vinyls yet, 2 of which arrived today.The vinyls I received are brand new. Not used. They have no scratches. I cleaned them beforehand. Pop one in and first thing I notice is it’s constantly slipping. One of the albums I ordered is a 3 disc vinyl, the other a one disc. I tried all four discs to make sure it wasn’t the vinyl records themselves, it wasn’t. They all were skipping constantly. Frustrated I turned to google. After some investigating I found out this is a common problem with this turntable. I read it you continue to use it it will lead to the needle actually scratching and permanently destroying your vinyls and possibly even warp them.To say I’m beyond disappoint is an understatement. I’m really hoping the my vinyls aren’t damaged already. I ordered another turntable, but it won’t arrive until Thursday due to Coronavirus and the extended delivery times for nonessential items. Guess I’ll find out then if the vinyls were permanently damaged by this poorly conceived product.In the end, imo, it’s worth paying the extra fifty to a hundred bucks to get a better low end entry level beginner turntable. When it comes to this monstrosity—JUST DON’T DO IT. It’s not worth the gamble.

  I bought this while searching for a STACK record player like my wonderful old Sears SILVERTONE 1957 record player that could play 16's, 45's, 33's and 78's, had great speakers and was portable!!  It is still working somewhat, but I felt it was ready to go after all these years. I bought this record player until I find a GOOD STACK record player.  Other than only playing ONE record at a time, the BIG problem is the dumb cover!!!  It does not close completely when playing 33's, and my CATS started to ""ride"" the record, so I had to move it into my closed-off sewing room. I DO NOT care at all about the blue tooth, and found it does NOT work! Also the record speed numbers are VERY hard to read and should be in RED.  I knew it would not play STACKS, but did think the cover closed. NO>>>I AM NOT PLEASED, but am keeping it because I cannot find what I really want at the moment. I'll just wait until GOOD STACK record players come out again to buy another. Well, it was cheap and does part of the job for right now. I sure hope to find a great stack player later with a large top that I can move from room to room as I did my old one. I have NO interest in ""blue tooth"", but I am INTERESTED in quality. This is not a bad player for a newbie or someone without cats, but it sure is time-consuming to change records constantly when doing housework!!

  If you're looking to play records and don't particularly care too much for good sound quality, then this turntable is for you. Don't let self-proclaimed turntable 'experts' steer you away from this novelty purchase, or make you feel bad for already owning one. This is a perfect novelty record player that plenty of newcomers can enjoy to start off their journey into this side of the music world. In the end, records are meant to be played. Enjoy them while you can.My recommendations:-Purchase a diamond needle to replace the stock one it comes with. Don't worry, it's easily replaceable. The needle it comes with is very low-quality and has a high chance to skip and sound 'hissy'.-If you plan on wanting good sound out of this thing, purchase some powered speakers. That partially ruins the 'portability' gimmick, but not by much.How's it feel?-It feels well constructed. It doesn't feel luxurious, mind you, but it also doesn't feel extremely cheap.How's the setup?-Easy. It's all set up and good to go, right out of the box. Practically plug-and-play.Hows the sound quality?-Bad. Lol. It's very 'tinny' and lacks depth. Bass is imperceptible. Mids and highs sound okay. The same can be said no matter if you're using the speakers or the headphone output. That's what should be expected at this price range. It can get very loud however, which is a good thing. It can fill a medium room with its loudness.How's the bluetooth?-Fine. Works as it should. Easy to connect. No problems so far.How's the portability?Good. It's got the body of a suitcase! Perfectly portable in that regard. One complaint I have however, is the fact that it doesn't have some sort of battery it runs off of. It *needs* to be plugged in. So its portability is only useful if you've got an outlet to plug it into.

The design of the mechanism itself is simple to use and seems to work really well with both the smaller 45s and the larger standard sized records that we tried with it. It has settings for 3 different types of records. The sound quality for both the actual records and the Bluetooth option were excellent, but is not overly bassy. The volume is more than loud enough to enjoy listening to in the same room or from another. Overall we had SUCH a nice time listening to old records and making new memories with this Victrola, and I highly recommend this product for folks of all ages looking for an affordable and easy way to listen to their records!

The music doesnt get thin, and you dont lose the base layers of the music when you turn the volume up, it is all equalized extremely well.It's cute, it looks very vintage, it plays very nicely and smoothly, and I love the lowering lever on the arm, because I am notorious for dragging the needle on my records and I'm glad it's VERY precise now.I'm buying one for my mum and brother, and I will never purchase another record player if it isn't a Victrola.

  So, as a young boy and then teenager, this type of record player was the go-to device everyone had. When I plugged this one in, at first, I was a little disappointed in the sound. But after trying a few other 45's, it seemed better. I had forgotten that 45 pressings can vary from label to label when it comes to sound.  I then tried a 33 size and the sound was even better. Don't expect great quality sound, but DO expect ease of use and a quality built product. It's handy to just pull out and put on something you haven't heard for years. I did so, and the record jolted me back 65 years to the last time I heard the song!  And it was great to hear it again.  Note, this was the SECOND one I tried. The first one was dead on arrival and I have to send it back. So glad this second one worked well.  Very well-priced, decent product; just not deluxe sound or bass.

  So for the price, I guess it's ok. I've read some horror stories about how eventually this player will wear down your vinyl, so I was wary of that. The purple color with the rose gold hardware is very cute. The speakers are kind of terrible, but that's to be expected. My main problem was with the sound quality, even when connected to nicer speakers.I hooked this up to my soundbar and listened to a record. The sound was kind of rough and wobbly. I then played the same record on a vintage turntable and it sounded 10 times better, removing all the noise and strengthening the overall sound. Then I played it on an Audio-Technica turntable and again, the sound was even better. I decided it was worth a little more money to get a turntable that sounds better and has less of a chance of wrecking my records. Admittedly I'm not super concerned about damage over time to my records, since I don't buy expensive vinyl and mostly purchase from thrift stores, but it was still something to consider.The sound just doesn't compare. If you really don't care about sound quality, record longevity, or just want something that will play records and look cute and vintage, by all means grab one of these. The price is good for a trendy piece of home decor.

  Growing up, my family acquired a pretty hefty cache of LPs. Aside from the usual arsenal everyone acquired in the 70s and early-mid 80s, at one point, my elementary school closed down, and the principal decided to give away the entire music library of the school (considerable) to anyone who wanted it. For no reason other than the sheer joy of taking something from the school, I hauled away armload after armload of records which have sat in my mom's basement for about 40 years, well preserved but also unlistened-to. A few weeks ago I was on the phone with her and she lamented the fact she no longer had a record-player, because she had a yen to listen to old records. I immediately went into Amazon and had this player sent to her house. I am pleased to announce she loves it. She loves the bright color of the case, loves that it is portable and can be played anywhere in the house (unlike the hefty systems of the past), and tells me the sound quality is quite good. She even noted that it reminds he strongly of the players she herself grew up with, so there's a nostalgia factor.All in all I think that this was a great buy. I haven't yet had a chance to try it out for myself but moms was happy and since she spent the first 40-odd years of her life listening to LPs and 45s, I think her standards have to be respected. I will add a report of my own the next time I visit, but for now I give this five stars. It does the job it is supposed to do, and for a very reasonable price.

  The sound quality coming out of this when playing a record is phenomenal!That being said, using the speakers via Bluetooth connection is absolutely worthless.  Playing music directly from my phone's speaker is indescribably louder than playing via Bluetooth through the record player's speakers, even at full volume.  I thought the Bluetooth feature was to transfer the record's sound to another device, which would be awesome, though obviously unlikely.

  I had jumped off the vinyl train several years ago, but lately I got some 7"" singles that have songs I can't find elsewhere, and decided I should probably get a turntable so I could actually hear them. If you are looking for something to occasionally play old records on, and don't care that much about superb sound quality, this is a decent choice. It plays just fine, but the speakers GREATLY limit the bass. If you are an audiophile and really care about great sound quality, be prepared to dish out a lot more money (and if you're buying new records, you should be able to afford that). So, for a 'beginner',or someone who just wants to pull out a record every so often, this is a nice affordable choice (the one I got was just a little over $30).

  Great product especially for the price. Very pleased with condition since it was well protected. Works flawlessly without any problems. The sound from the speakers are clear from using records. When using bluetooth (BT as it's abbreviated on device) it doesn't sound as great as it should so that could improve a tad bit. Maybe adding more bass into the speakers will make it improve better. As a whole, it worth the value.

  When I was 25, some idiot my husband (at the time) knew and apparently owed money to broke into our house and stole my entire record collection that I had been building since I was 12. I never got any of the records back, and I divorced the loser husband, but for many years, I went without records. Eventually I had cassettes, and then CDs, and then computers/phone playlists. But I never forgot all those records, and they were such a HUGE part of some of my best memories, and a whole soundtrack to my life that was missing, so that I began to wish I had those records again. I just wanted an easy to use record player that didn't take up too much space, didn't cost too much, and was nice looking. This one checked all the boxes. It sounds decent, although I did end  up buying external speakers for it but I could have done without them, I just wanted to be able to turn my music up a little more if I choose to do that. I think it's beautiful, and the wood feels good. Everything was there and worked perfectly. I am completely satisfied, and really looking forward to building my record collection back. It looks like I can't afford any of the many, many albums I had originally, they are apparently collector's items now and most of them have prices in the triple digits these days instead of the handful of dollars I paid for them back in the day. But I love music and I am building up a new collection, now. It's having a major healing effect. I am thankful for this record player starting all of that.

  I was concerned because of many of the negative reviews on here, but I really like the Victrola portable suitcase record player. First of all, the sound is great. I have played vinyl records and songs from my phone using the Bluetooth feature, and the sound is actually pretty loud. The speakers don't sound tinny. The only downside is that there's not too much bass, but you could hook up more high quality speakers, but I don't feel the need to do so. This record player's sound quality is much better than a Jensen record player I had a while back.I also like that there is a knob to switch between Bluetooth, Line In, and Phonograph. The light even changes color to indicate which mode you're on. My phone easily connected to the record player via Bluetooth, and the sound quality is excellent.Lastly, the look of the record player is really great. The material doesn't feel cheap, and the turquoise color really pops. The suitcase look is very vintage. I highly recommend this record player.

  I got this record as a Christmas present and if I wrote my review on day 1, I would have been raving about it. It looks adorable, it was easy to set up for a beginner and for the first few days worked just fine. However, I started to notice my record skipping, in parts sounding like it’s on slo-mo and instead of looking flat as it spun..would look like it was on a wave.Naturally, I thought it was the record I purchased so I brought it back to the shop. When they tested the record on their record player, the three above-mentioned issues were resolved. The store owner asked me if I had a Victrola or Crosley record player with built-in speakers. He explained that this happens commonly with these record players and that often, they do a number on the records themselves. What a disappointment. Also, FYI: (this has nothing to do with the rating, purely an FYI) The volume is fit for a medium to large room, it won’t fill a floor of your home with music and definitely not a house full of guests.

  I received some records and wanted a player with built in speakers and this was perfect!  It worked well for the 3 times I played it and when i went to use it again nothing happened!  I had set it up in its home so I hadn't moved it I just plugged it back in.  It seemed not to get power and when I tried a different adapter it lasted for like 30 seconds.  I really enjoyed this while it worked so I'm taking a chance on a replacement and if that fails its a total return.Update May 6 2020They didn't replace the item they fixed the one I had and sent it back in the box I sent but didn't reseal it.

  My husband and I inherited a huge box of vinyl records but had no way to play them. Ordered this Victrola and couldn't be happier!! I was eagerly awaiting delivery and had this bad boy unboxed, and opened playing records in under 10 minutes! The packaging was done with care to protect the player during shipping. The instructions were super easy to read and understand. I literally have had it in my possession for less than 30 minutes so I have yet to try out any of the other features like bluetooth connectivity, but honestly i don't plan on using it for that. So, if you are looking for a great portable record player with easy operating instructions this is the one for you! I love it!! It even came with an extra replacement needle, and a built in 45 RPM adaptor. It has 3 speed capabilities and an auto stop option.

  This is my second record player from Victoria.  The first was a Christmas gift, and I excitedly put on a brand new record...and it skipped.  I tried an old record...skipped.  It skipped on every record I tried.So, I returned it.  I ordered a DIFFERENT record player, it was so shoddy, and felt so cheap that I returned THAT one.  But, at least it played my records in full.Then I started researching.  I’m not enthusiastic enough to spend over $100, so I started searching for “best record players under $100” and this one was the TOP of multiple lists.  I figured my first one was a fluke, so I tried again. And SURPRISE, I have the exact same issue.  And even when it does play, the static is wild, and if I turn the volume up too high the sound starts to distort.

The sound quality was ok, however, I have a portable Bluetooth speaker at home that has better sound quality and output that I paid half the price for. She stopped using the record player because it skipped constantly (even after we replaced the little end piece) and uses it strictly for the speaker to play music from her phone.

  The Bluetooth function does NOT allow you to play a record through an external bluetooth speaker. You can only use the record player's speakers to INPUT music from an external source, and the record player's sound quality is lower than a typical iPhone. Not knowing this, after unpacking unit, I switched it to Bluetooth and paired with my iPhone. The turntable stopped and music from my iPhone playlist began (faintly) playing through the record player.  Thought it was broken until I read another review from a few days ago and realized that you CANNOT USE THIS to transmit music FROM the record player TO an external bluetooth speaker. (might work with AUX cord, haven't tried).  The product description (obliquely) says so but I didn't catch this before buying.  I will keep it as it's cute and only purchased to play some very old childhood records that have sentimental value only.

  I bought this refurbished by the seller, which came out to be essentially like new. The sound quality on the phonograph is alright. It plays records in a lofi sound quality, but it's still perfectly fine listening to it. If you're into listening to your records in the highest quality possible, you already aren't looking to buy this. This product is aimed at people who simply want to have an inexpensive way to listen to records, or even to get into the hobby.The build quality is alright. I'm not taking it traveling, so I'm not to worried about it holding up to force. Mine was pretty tough to get to the insides for tinkering. I had to take a razor blade to split the seams enough to lift the wooden panel up. The tonearm on mine came down pretty fast, which threw me off since the same model I replaced with this had its tonearm take a comfortably slow lowering to records. I had to add Elmer's glue to the tonearm mechanism to get it to ease on the speed, and now it falls much softer.What really surprised me about this player was the Bluetooth functionality. It's an okay phonograph, but a surprisingly amazing sounding Bluetooth speaker. With the lid closed, I was shocked how good music sounded from its built in speakers. The speakers don't really do records justice, but with Spotify and YouTube connected to it through it from my phone, it's a full, high quality sound. The size of the entire case really helps give it that quality sound. When the lid is opened, it still sound fine, but not as good as it is closed.I paid around $20 for mine, and at that price I think it's fair. Don't pay much more for it though, you can get better players than this.

If you buy new records, maybe you'll get a song or two that plays properly, but the rest of your album will skip. Any new record is doing this for me. I am passed the return window so Amazon agreed to return, but were charging me a restock fee. On a $50 unit.. it's not worth it.

The item itself is a tad flimsy on the inside. Don’t push or pull anything too hard or it will probably break. As far as the look - it’s lovely. If this is something you’re buying for decoration, then it’s probably a good fit. The color is nice and the record player buckles up well. I don’t use headphones but there is also an AUX and headphone jack in case you want to connect it to other speakers or your headphones. But honestly, I bought this thing in hopes it could make it’s own decent sound. So I will be asking for a return as the quality of sound and music is not good. Also, the speed goes up and down during the songs. So it will play super fast and then super slow randomly. 🙄

This makes a great player for anyone who doesn't care about audiophile sound quality so this makes a really cool gift for like 90% of people. I've bought 3 so far; one for me and two for gifts to family members. The Bluetooth function is great as it allows it to be used to play music from your phone (Hard to carry 15 vinyls to a picnic). All in all, this makes a great record player for its price and makes a wonderful gift to anyone who maybe wants to play records but maybe doesn't want to shell out 90 plus bucks for a full blown stereo compatible player. My grandpa and mom loved these as gifts because they love the nostalgia of records but also don't know how to set up and hook up a stereo and speakers for a full player.

It’s all high end and extremely harsh to listen to. When using Bluetooth, the sound is passable with the external speakers. But do not buy this for playing records. It’s awful. If I could return mine I would, but it’s long past the return date.

   Review of: ""Victrola Vintage 3-Speed Bluetooth Suitcase Turntable with Speakers, Black.""This is a very reasonable priced portable plug-and-play system that allows you to play your LP's in 33/45/78 RPMs.  The case is sturdy and light and the arm and needle are very sensitive.  The sound quality is fantastic for a system this size and you have the option to line in using an AUX cord or use Bluetooth with the system to play music or sound.  I am very impressed by this system.  After having sold my multi-component Onkyo sound system and massive speakers years ago to include my turntable I can once again play my vinyl.  It is wonderful.  The sound and features of this small system rank high.  Five stars.

  The sound that is produced is not in stereo. I thought I could connect external speakers but the outputs aren’t working. Bluetooth doesn’t allow you to connect to a Bluetooth speaker, but does allow you to play music through the record player, and sounds wonderfully mono. I was so excited to get this and I’m very disappointed.

  For the price this is a Surprisingly good record player.I purchased it for my teen who is interested in playing old vinyl records.With Auto-off mode, the table stops spinning too soon before a record is over. This is more annoying when spinning 45 size records. With the auto-off feature disabled, records do reach the end. So that’s a workaround.The sound from the small speakers is also Surprisingly good. Taking the sound out of the earphone jack into a Portable, more robust speaker works well too.It’s a belt driven turntable without the ability to adjust the speed. But, it’s a great entry level turntable for a teen wanting to experience music the old fashioned way.Mine is enjoying playing the full albums and reading the liner notes and lyrics.... the way it should be.

  I'll just say flat-out that I am pleasantly surprised at how good my unit sounds. For the price, I certainly expected worse. I have been listening to Miles Davis - Kind of Blue for the last couple hours, and my Klipsch's are making this thing sing. It really does sound quite good, and for what this cost, I have absolutely 0 complaints on that end of things. As far as the built-in speakers, I only heard them for a minute before hooking the player into a much larger separate system, but from what I did hear, the built-in speakers were adequate, thought certainly not outstanding. If you have a separate system of decent or higher quality to plug this into, I strongly recommend you do that if you mainly plan to listen to it at home.The only thing that caused me to dock a star is that the unit I received does have an immediately noticeable amount of wobble on the platter. This is not affecting the sound quality and it still appears to be operating within spec, but the leveling of the platter is still something that certainly could be done better. But again, for the price you're paying here, you really can't go expecting perfection. Overall, this is great first foray into vinyl, and I never thought I'd enjoy it as much as I am.

  It's cute, it's very basic, and it plays LPs. So it does what it says it'll do. Four stars because the sound isn't great but honestly I didn't expect it to be. I think you could connect it to a stereo but tbh I don't listen to albums like in the old days, one after another after another. It's fun to pop an album on from the 70s or 60s and listen to it then flip it over and listen to the other side. One gets used to endless streams of music with all the digital stuff we have nowadays but there's something satisfying about playing an LP you used to play ages ago.Oh and the needle drops quite lightly on the album, not fast like one might expect on a cheaper turntable like this.

  Pros: Great for beginners like meEasy to use and very portableA price practically anyone can affordGreat color choicesCons: cheap feeling plastics on the insideBuilt in speakers suckYou need to hookup speakers to get good soundThe Bluetooth is pretty much pointless because i cant use it with a Bluetooth speaker and the record wont spin in Bluetooth mode anywaysWith all that being said the cheap plastics can be expected at this price point so I’ll let that pass but I don’t get the point if having a Bluetooth mode if you cant play the music through a Bluetooth speaker plus the record only spins when its in phono mode so even if you could pair it to a speaker it would be pointless anyways, that being the main reason i only gave it 4 stars. But for the price this is an amazing record player. I bought a mini amplifier and i used some old bookshelf speakers that i had and I hooked them up to the record player and it sounds great and is the perfect little setup (as seen in the attached picture)

  Turntable seemed very easy to set up.  Once an album was played, you immediately hear poor tinny sound quality for the internal speakers.  Doubting the internal, I connected external speakers to the RCA jacks.  Same tinny result.  So I decided to connect to Bluetooth with my iPhone.  That made a difference.  This leads me to believe they are using a cheap stylus and cartridge.  I have asked tech support if there is a higher quality stylus and cartridge that can be used on the player.  I have yet to hear back from them, it has been almost a week.

    Great Gift Idea
  
",5.0,Susan Heavens,"Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2017","









  
  
    
  Our unit worked as expected out of the box. The turntable rotates completely flat, the needle arm picks up well with the lifter and drops very quietly onto the record.  At the end of the tracks it stops the turntable with the needle in the center of the record.  The sound is quite loud enough for a single room very similar to the original units that we played in the 60/70's.  Certainly not HiFi but considering the tiny speakers it's very good, more treble than base.  Plugging in the RCA or Headphone outputs to another speaker system gives better sound with more bass.  Note that the Bluetooth is only a receiver and so you'll need to plug in a BT Transmitter into the RCA or headphone jacks if you want to play records via BT to another BT speaker system.The black case looks nice and ""retro"" on top of our wooden stereo cabinet and we like the idea that we can shut the case and keep the dust out or just snap closed the latch and pick it up like a mini suitcase and take it with us to someplace else.  Great value for the money, a good ""novelty"" gift for someone who has a stash of old 33 records that they haven't listened to for 40 years!

    Decent record player for those new to vinyl, may need to modify
  
",4.0,Caleb,"Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  This isn't a bad record player, it has decent sound quality and does what it was made to do. It is a pretty good starter or budget player for listeners branching out or getting back into vinyl. That said it does have its own issues. Out of the box this record player would skip on older vinyls and there was a strange scratch noise when I played any of my collection. After a few minutes of scrutiny using an inherited scratched record (something I keep for diagnostic tests for any new player), I found that the skip was because the arm didn't lower enough to maintain contact with the vinyl. The fix was a rubber disc that I had left over from a broken record player. The rubber disc raised the record high enough to maintain needle contact even on slightly warped records. The second issue of the scratching noise turned out to be caused by a plastic guard at the base of the arm. This small piece of plastic would rub at the edge of the vinyls while spinning producing the scratch noise. That fix was simply using a fine fingernail emery board (800/10000 grit) to remove just enough material to put a stop to the noise but not impede the function of the plastic guard. After those simple fixes I had no problems with the record player.

  I purchased this record player, and all it did was skip. I tried several different records and had the same results. I cleaned the records, made sure the needle was good etc. I finally called the technical support number where I was told that any records purchased after the year 2000 will not work properly on this player (there is nothing about this mentioned on the product details page). Support said I could put a penny or nickle on the arm base to see if that helps. I did not spend $50 to rig it to work. I expect a working product or to have been told up front what works and what doesn't so I wouldn't have to waste my time to purchase. Please do not waste time or money on this!

  Will be returning this player. It was enticing at first with its cute color and design but the proof is in the pudding and this player is not worth the money.

On a side note, I suppose foolishness on my part but I thought that the bluetooth feature would allow me to play records through my nice marshall speaker. Nope! You can however a connect your phone to the crappy speakers of the record player, so if you want your music to sound like sharing one ear bud with three people than its a great feature.

I don’t know very much about sound quality and which speakers are the best to purchase , but I assumed that a well known brand like Victrola would make a decent product.

  I bought this unit thinking it would be cool to take my vinyl collection with me sometimes. I was hoping to share the listening experience of old music, as I have records from the 1920's. When I got the item, I unpackaged it right away. It was exactly what was pictured. It looked great.Excited to try it out, I play one of my vintage Christmas records on it. This was a regular 33 vinyl record. So, nothing special, and did not require the special stylus for the 78 records. OH BOY, I thought while shaking my head in disappointment. The sound was HORRIBLE.......absolutely HORRIBLE. I have 5$ Bluetooth speakers that sounds better than this.The description for this product states ""Additional features include a custom tuned Pre-Amp for improved audio clarity and bass performance"". The was not the case. The custom tuned pre-Amp has the high tones up way too far. So much that the speakers peak. There is absolutely no bass tones. The mids are muffled.I figured I would try to connect it to a Bluetooth speaker, thinking the quality would be better. NOPE.....it was the same.....absolute garbage..... Trust me, my Bluetooth speaker is high quality. I took it a step further and plugged in some high quality in ear headphones that I use as a musician. They have 5 drivers in each ear. So the sound should be amazing.......NOPE.....again, complete GARBAGE.Secondly, I would like to add, that the stylus on this player can be harsh on your records. looking at an independent review, they advise not to use this unit for everyday use, as it will wear out the grooves in your records. What good is a record player if you cannot use it to play your records as much as you want?On the tech side of things, most records are made or vinyl. A 33-vinyl record has a groove that is 0.7 mils wide. A 78 has a groove that is 0.3 mils wide. If you use the wider stylus in an old 78 record you will ruin it. The stylus on this product is metal......that's right, metal. What happens when you place metal on plastic? Kiss the record good bye. Most stylus back in the day were made of diamonds or sapphires. They would fit in the groove exactly and produce a high-quality sound. Over time a record will break down, that's normal. But using the wrong stylus, you will accelerate the breakdown. Oh, and you cannot change out or upgrade the stylus. The cartage and stylus is sold as one unit and only fits this unit. No other aftermarket parts will fit.Stop!!!!!, and do yourself a favor, look for other record players with better quality. As for me, I'm not going to ruin my collection because of a low-quality product. GARBAGE......

  There is no method of balancing the tone arm. This POS bounces like a cheap stripper in a North Florida bikini bar. The best you can do is tape two nickles to the tone arm and that slows down the rotation. IT has refused to respond so I have a record player with a couple of nickles.

  Worst purchase I've made. I bought this in March for my daughter, but because of the pandemic it was in storage until she moved out in the fall. When she finally opened it, it did not work at all. Since I was past the return deadline, I tried working directly with the manufacturer. They sent me a new cord which turned on the power, but only produced a high-pitch whining sound. VERY disappointed that they would not follow up. We're out the full cost with no option i know of except throwing it in the trash. Such a disappointment!

  I love this victrola record player. I'm so happy to be able to play my record collection now. It's a beautiful player and it works great. The sound is OK, but you can add speakers if you want to. Bluetooth speakers will work if they have an Auxilary input. The player does not send Bluetooth signals but will receive (like from your phone). Extra Note :the Autostop works perfect with albums (big records) but stops a little too soon with some 45s (small records). But there is an off/on switch for this, so put it off while playing 45s. It seems to be well made and I'm very happy with it. It comes with an extra needle and if you register it on Victrola.com/registration with the model number and serial number, they will even send you another replacement needle as a gift. (at least they are doing that at the moment lol) it's always good to have backups.

  If I had written this review when I first received this turntable, the review would have been glowing.It was a Warehouse bargain but the only noted damage was to the box.I've been using this for a little over a month, a few hours a week when I work from my home office, and it has already stopped working. It will no longer turn on.I'm so disappointed. This was a birthday present to myself so that I could enjoy the vinyl records I've been collecting for years without having to fire up our big stereo system. There should have been way more than a month of service for the price I paid. It's worth spending a little extra to get a nicer, more recognized brand.It's so unfortunate that I'm out of the return window and stuck with just a little red suitcase.

  I love the design and the functionality of this as a speaker, but as a record player, it is terrible. Most of my records don't play without skipping, and it is especially true with records that are newer releases or have any coloring to the vinyl. But even older vinyl has issues, too. I do not own a single record that plays without skipping on this machine.  But all is not lost - it does work really well as a speaker, and it is usually very easy to connect to devices via Bluetooth. But I didn't buy this to use as a speaker - I bought it as a record player, and it absolutely FAILS at that!

  The record player I used previously has issues playing some of my heavier weighted records, but this player handles the heavy records very easily! In addition to that, I hadn't noticed (when I purchased the player) the little switch or lever that moves the tone arm over the record and slowly drops it into place! That was a nice surprise since I always have issues dropping the needle accidentally. The color of the suitcase is just as advertised. The speakers are good quality, but can have some unpleasant fuzz when the sound is turned too loud or a particularly intense part of the record is playing. The music coming out of the speakers is soft and creates a nice ambiance in my room. I would definitely purchase this player again and recommend it to those looking to purchase one. Regardless if you're a a novice or experienced record listener, this player will satisfy! It comes with a replacement needle, power cord, and 45 adapter.

  This is really, really not a quality record player.  I understand why people are drawn to it.  The case is really nice-looking in a vintage way, and it's cool to think that you're tapping into the long history of Victrola.  The sound is OK for what it is, when it works.Unfortunately, that name is all this player has to do with Victrola.  The player uses a needle and turntable assembly that is very, very cheap and low quality and is used in almost *all* portable suitcase players.  (There are videos out about this if you look around.)  Mine worked fine for about two months, and then decided to stop spinning records at the right speeds.  If you have any experience with record players you can tell how flimsy it is when you use it.  Also, this doesn't have Bluetooth connectivity in the sense that you can use a Bluetooth speaker with the player - it means that you can use the speakers on the player with one of your other devices like a phone or a laptop.If you want something portable, there are much more reputable companies out there making much better players in the low $100s.

So I ordered the product a second time because I like the way it looks and really wanted to play my records. When the product arrived today, the second time, it was not in a protective box, just the actual product box with a bunch of packaging tape on it which was clearly covering up a huge hole in the box. When I opened the box the product looked fine, it actually looked cool. I read the directions and plugged it in, and turned it on...the “on” light came on but when i went to put the tone arm on the record the turn table wouldn’t spin at all. There was nothing plugged into the aux in/out so that wasn’t the problem and the belt was on fine. I assume it is a motor issue. Anyhow Im sending it back now.

  I've always wanted one of these small record players, so after seeing the very reasonable price on this one I decided to try it out. The sound is amazing for the size of the speakers, and the slight crackle just adds another layer of vintage to whatever you're listening to. It's very easy to use, and the color is stunning. Overall, it's a fantastic little record player and I could recommend it to anyone who's never owned a record player and doesn't really know how to operate one. And it's super easy to find vintage records at antique shops for cheap, which just makes the whole deal even better.

   This is my first record player and I couldn’t be happier. The speakers have nice sound for the size and price of the unit. The unit feels fairly sturdy as well and I never noticed in tininess and am someone who often finds themselves annoyed by audio equipment in this price range. Obviously if you have some good speakers you’ll want to use those over the built in speakers but if you want something portable to use around the house or just to see if records are for you this is a good place to start and has a headphone out for pc speakers as well as the red and whites for traditional speakers.

Great time and we'll be going through some of those old ABBA, BEATLES< SHA-NA-NA, Joni Mitchel, James Taylor and more.

",3.0,Danny,"Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  It looks BEAUTIFUL. Very easy to use. Sound quality is not at all what I thought it would be. I’ve bought Victrolas in the past and was therefore expecting it to sound clear, rich, and full. When I used it it sounded very tinny, muddled, and gravelly...as if someone threw sand into the speaker. Hopefully you have a better experience than I. I thought I would be able to connect it to an external speaker (my Alexa) via Bluetooth so I could hear the vinyl quality but through different speakers...nope. The record player itself acts as an external speaker (though I recommend against it given the sound quality) and you cannot connect to BT and play your record at the same time.

  This is a good buy for under $40 if you aren’t overly concerned with audio quality.  However, I think most of us who buy this expecting it to be able to connect to Bluetooth speakers are disappointed.  The speakers are really poor.  The Bluetooth functions do not allow you to play the phonograph over Bluetooth speakers as I believe most would expect.  Rather, the phonograph acts as a Bluetooth speaker...and a poor one.

  This product looks really nice, but that's about it. As previously mentioned, the arm has no counterweight, so it will put too much pressure on the needle and scratch up your records. The turntable is made of thin plastic and extremely flimsy, my thicker 33s were extremely wobbly on it, which could lead to damaging your records. The sound was pretty bad, I'm not sure of the speaker quality was the problem or the cheap setup was the culprit for it, but the sound was fuzzy. The bluetooth does not allow you to play vinyl on other speakers, it allows you to use the record player speakers to play music from other devices, such as your phone, this is disappointing.This thing is a nice decoration, but the low quality will end up ruining your records.

  This should be purchased for children only. It does not have quality sound. The speakers are very tinmy, and there’s only one port for an additional speaker.  We knew this before purchase, but to reiterate, it is Bluetooth only in the sense that the Tenny speakers will broadcast whatever you have playing on your phone or other device, not the reverse. It’s a cheap little thing,  I guess you get what you pay for.  It turns records and functions even though Amazon did not pack it within another box. The original packaging was beat all to hell, but the thing works anyway.

  First off, my 13 year-old loves this.  It's her first experience with records and she doesn't seem to notice or care about the awful, tinny, distorted, low-fi sound.  I did plug it into an external powered computer speaker which helps some.  So I guess this is OK as a starter turntable for a kid, but if you care even remotely (and I mean even the slightest) about sound quality, skip this model.  It sounds about as good as a 1970's AM transistor radio.  It does look cute though.

  As soon as I got this turntable, it wasn’t working. I tried a bunch of different records (old, new, different sizes, etc.) and no matter what, it was skipping constantly. There is no way to balance the arm on the player, so I tried doing it myself with coins and small weights. Still skipping. I tried changing the needle with the replacement they sent. Still skipping. I contacted customer support for Victrola and their advice to me was to attempt to balance the arms myself (as I had already tried). Their advice is to tamper with their product in order for it to work. They sold a product that literally will not do the bare minimum (play music) without tampering with it using fishing weights I had to buy separately. They also told me it’s not compatible with 150/180 gram records. I could not find that information anywhere in the product description before buying it. This is false advertising. I’m waiting to hear back again from customer service about this. Hopefully they will attempt to refund or replace the product but I’m not sure they will considering they’re already sneaky enough to sell a brand new product that is useless.

  arrived fast and was in great condition! this was my first record player and the original needle it came with made the records skip, luckily they provide a backup with it and that needle works just fine!. As for the speakers there are alot of mixed reviews, for a portable speaker they are pretty good, about as good as a mid grade phone or a 15$ Bluetooth speaker from Walmart. if you are an audiophile looking for really good quality sound you need to have some of your own separate speakers to hook this up to. It has stereo plug ins on the back and I have it hooked up to an amp and it sounds great! if you don't care too much about sound quality and just want a cheap small record player I would definitely recommend this! The records wobble a little which I have heard is normal and doesn't affect the sound. for the average person this player is perfect but if you are looking for something high end that will be stationary in your room then you will need to spend way more than 40$. personally I love it and use it all the time, the colors are very pretty too! Perfect for a first time record player and would make a fantastic gift for anyone who enjoys listening to records!

  At first, I was a little disappointed with the overall sound quality the product produced. It's akin to listen to music thru your phone without any headphones... sounded ok, but unbalanced with little to no bass. I didn't really mind too much, considering how much I spent on the product. BUT while listening to my 4th record, the speakers stopped producing adequate volume in the middle of a song. I didn't pick it up, move it, hit it or shake it... the volumed just cut almost completely out. I have it turned up all the way and I can barley hear anything. I can obviously only speak from my own experience, but I think you might be able to find something a little better for the same price.

  This earns 5 stars because of what you get for the price. To start with the bad: the sound sucks, everything about it feels cheap.The good: it’s a less than a $50 record player, it has built in speakers (bad speakers, but speakers none the less), plays 3 different speeds, rca or 3.5mm output, and it’s compact. I have mine connected to a Vizio soundbar set up (rca), and it sounds just fine.For the money, this thing is amazing! As good as a $300+ record player? No, definitely not. If you have $300 for a good record player and another $300 for the necessary sound system, do that (all seriousness, do it, your records and ears will thank you). But if you want a cheap and compact way to play your records, this is the way to go.

  If you think your going to have great sound quality or be able to connect this record player to wireless Bluetooth Speakers, you are sadly mistaken. I thought the same thing... You have to connect some good quality speakers to the rear connecting ports. The small speakers in the front do play the music and sound decent, but they are not the greatest.

  It was very easy to set this record player up, and within minutes, we were listening to music.  The sound produced by the built-in speakers is pretty clear, and although some of the previous reviews recommend a slip mat, this doesn't seem necessary because the turntable has small rubber spots that hold the record in place.  We also didn't have any issues regarding the records skipping as some of the other reviews pointed out.  One thing to note is that the record player does seem very fragile, and needs to be handled with considerable care.  In my opinion, this is definitely not something for children.  However, even though it doesn't compare to my $250 Gemini turntable (I wouldn't expect it to), it's a cool, relatively compact device to put in a place that your traditional record player set-up may not fit.

  Cheap way to spin your old vinyl.  I got a great deal on it as I ordered the camouflage record player. It was about half the price of the nicer looking colors.  Mine arrived in perfect condition.  The unit is well built from canvas covered ""wood"" with steel corner protection.  When I played my first couple records on it, it skipped a little bit. I solved that by putting a small weight on top of the needle - maybe an ounce or two (couple nuts).  Sound is tinny and no bass from the built in speakers.  It is acceptable for some.  Other than that, it played very well.  Extremely portable and easy to set up.I'm going to hook it up to my big stereo system so that should take care of the audio quality.

I will say if you are looking for a compact personal player to enjoy your records, I think this one is a good choice and I'm very happy with my purchase.

  Great value.  Amazing features incl stylus lift, auto stop.  speakers are a bit small & tinny, as expected, but output jacks allow bookshelf adders.  Easy to use.  Very pleased.  Book doesn't ID all the shipping protection.  Most are obvious, but note:. The arm has a hold-down clip, and the stylus has a removeable cover.  Only diappointment is no bass/treble control (didn't expect an equalizer at this price)

  Although the sound quality was great for the price of the item, it is pure crap other than that. The turntable was wobbly in play causing my records/LPs to skip. No there was nothing wrong with my LPs, any record that I put on the turntable they skipped or repeated the same section. I would not waste my time or money, just a poor quality record player.

  This is very deceiving. You are not able to use the Bluetooth function to hear your album on good speakers, BUT, you can connect another device to ""vintage speaker"" that shows up on the Bluetooth list and play music from your device with the speakers on the record player. When I bought it, I thought the album would play through my Bose speakers via Bluetooth. So...this was disappointing to say the least. I think you can line in an external speaker though. It plays very nicely and the speakers on it are sufficient for our 11 year old to use for her introduction to record albums.

  Let’s cut to the chase. The speakers are horrible if you want sonic range and depth, but that doesn’t mean this product is useless. You didn’t really expect Bose quality speakers for the price, did you? Ah but that’s where this product can be saved. Go buy some Bose or JBL portable speaker and then you can line out from the record player to the speaker to have some quality. Let record player do it’s job and spin the vinyl and get some real portable speakers for the sound - it’s only way to save the music. You will then be happy with this product if you were aiming for the whole portable “I’m gonna subject my friends to neutral milk hotel on their back deck gathering” record player thing.If you however want a record player for your home and you are serious about playing vinyl on a regular basis, go get a real turntable with a quality tone-arm that as the counter weight and anti-skate features. Your records deserve better on the home front. Happy spinning 😎

  I was really excited to buy this product because my brother got me my first vinyl for Christmas. I didn't do much research before looking on Amazon, but I knew since it was my first record player I wanted something on the cheaper side. I found this one and the reviews were good, so I wanted to give it a try. Setting it up was easy to follow and the color is very pretty. I was really delighted at first, but then the sound quality got really weird. There was a buzzing sound, and that sound was still apparent when I turned the volume down. Then, it skipped! I was really disappointed and did some research on how to fix this. I found that I needed to adjust the anti-skate control. Well this cheap record player doesn't have that. I thought maybe there was some dirt or dust stuck in the record so I invested in the Boundless Record Brush (I recommend). Nope, both problems were still there. Honestly, even if it is your first record player, buy something a little more expensive. It's cheap for a reason.

  I was so excited about this product. It is so cute and the perfect size, comes with built in speakers. The product description sounded great. However does not come with a platter mat or a slipmat. The arm is lightweight. I have not been able to use it without it skipping immediately. I think this is because of the cheap, lightweight arm. All of my records are brand new and I haven’t been able to play a single one. I recommend paying more for a better product that includes everything you need up front because in buying the platter mat and the slipmat, I ended up paying an additional $40 and still it doesn’t play.

  We have not been able to use it yet - we've spent more than an hour very carefully trying to fit the black cartridge holder into its slot in the arm. As received, this part, with the red stylus installed, was hanging loose from the arm, inside a small plastic bag. (During the struggle to install it, the red plastic piece that holds the needle popped out, and is presently safely waiting for us to get the black carrier popped into its slot in the end of the arm.) Very careful examination using  bright lights and a magnifier show that the black plastic slot tin the end of the arm, that the black needle carrier block is supposed to fit into, is ever so slightly too small to receive the piece. We have tried applying a small bit of force to pop it in, but so far to no avail. I am happy to write a good review if and when this issue is resolved. Right now I am taking a break. Super frustrating.

  We grandparents purchased this turntable for a 4yo granddaughter. It is much too delicate for her. This statement is actually a compliment. The quality is excellent but delicate. A 4yo needs guidance in how to lift and set the delicate arm. This player seems way better than its inexpensive price. The player has ports for external speakers and headphones. I've downgraded the sound quality because the two included stereo speakers are too small for full 20-20,000 Hz reproduction, but fine for portable listening. Except for the two small speakers, the platter, needle, arm, lift are near professional quality.

  This is designed to play older vinyls. Most vinyl now is 180 grams. This junk has a super light arm so to even attempt to play modern records, you have to tape a penny to the arm. If you're lucky, they play through the first time. But have no fear-by the 5th play through, the record will start skipping. If you aren't lucky, this will just damage your records.So, if you only have records from the 80s or before you should be fine. But if you're living in this century and half your records are the heavy-duty new ones, enough not listening to half your collection.

Pro tip lol when trying to connect to this device via Bluetooth, you have to be ready to pair it right away. If you miss the window turn the device to Phono or away from Bluetooth and then back and you should see it show up in your Bluetooth scan. The speakers are not very loud but they are crisp. Vinyl should sound very nice through this. You also have a Mic input as well as RCA out in the back of the unit so you should be able to pump this through your home audio system.

    4 problems with this HORRIBLE record player

   I got this Record player especially for the color and rose gold detailing and that’s literally the only thing I still like about it...other than that bad buy for a beginners player; I purchased this one specifically twice in row first time had to return it since it had horrible skipping defect, that actually ruined my brand new vinyl. The second time same problem, on top of a nasty dent on the back side since it was delivered to me in just the old/used looking victrola package box with a sticker label on the front. I don’t understand why amazon would ever do that but anyway, overall really upset that I had such a bad experience both times, and wish I didn’t have to return it because I love the color.

  This is an awesome little turntable, but guess what?  The sound isn't that great, whoa!!  Yea because the speakers are like 2"" wide!  I can't believe some reviews are complaining about ""no bass""!! LOL, yeah because the speakers are like 2"" wide!!  Geez!  For $35 what did you expect?!  Anyway, great little turntable, sound is decent, hopefully it will last a while :-)  P.S. the speakers are like 2"" wide!!  lol....

  Yes, this is definitely an entry level record player. For some reason I thought the sound would be decent enough but, like everyone had said, you get what you pay for. The player has a nice look to it but this is essentially a toy. I'm no audio snob but I need my records to sound close to what I listened to as a kid.  I'm trying out the AT 60.

  I bought this record player for my partner for his Christmas, and he absolutely loved it!  The record player is easy to use, and also has support for Bluetooth, and auxillary.  However, you'll definitely want to use external speakers for this player as the sound quality isn't the best.After two weeks of using the record player, it stopped working ... We were able to get a replacement shipment quickly.  We haven't had any issues with the new record player since.Overall, this is a great product if you are buying it as a gift for someone who wants to start a record collection.  If you're purchasing this for audiophiles, you may want to consider a product with better quality.

  I was satisfied with purchase but after a few months the record player would no longer turn on. The company told me it was probably a bad power supply and they sent me a new power supply. I have written them multiple times to inform them that this did not fix the problem. They do not bother to respond. My one year warranty ends Dec 2020, I assume they are just waiting to say my warranty has expired. Very disappointed in Victrola.  They do not stand by behind their warranty.

  Gifted this to my dad, broke within 3 days. Reached out to Victrola support, they said hold the product and we will ship you another power adapter to ensure the power is working. After 3 weeks I get the adapter during which I was no longer for amazon refund. Tested with the new adapter, the issue was not the adapter but the power unit within the device. I responded back with this and they just ignored my 3 attempts to reach out for next steps to either give me a refund or ship another device.Waste of my time and money.

  So disappointed in what we received. There was no packing material inside the box so our product was bouncing around. The merchandise box was opened and ripped. No instructions no Manuel and missing parts. Did not turn on and was hot after 30 minutes plugged in and us trying to figure out how to turn it on. It should turn on when we turned it to ON but it did nothing, no light turned on. It was for my son and he researched watching videos and searching Manuel’s.

It comes in a suitcase, compact enough to have all of the things you need to play a record.

",2.0,Todd Kalk,"Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  Purchased this item for portability and easy, affordable access to playing vinyl records that I'm quickly amassing from thrift stores and estate sales.  Price was very attractive and Victrola brand is legendary, so thought I couldn't go wrong.  Novelty British flag design was an added plus.Received incorrect style of the item (no British flag rather, a solid, black velvet case) - but nevertheless gave it a spin.  5 of the 10 records I played skipped horribly - particularly on the first half of each side.  I suspect it has something to do with the design - 33 1/3 LP records actually extend out beyond the record platform and cabinet, so I think lack of stability underneath the vinyl is an issue - and results in needle kicking up - particularly if there is a slight warp to the record (which many vintage records have).  Returned the item and purchased another Victrola model (VTA-65) that has better support underneath LP's and so far have had no issues with skipping.  All the records that skipped on this model didn't on the VTA-65.

  I was a bit worried ordering this because the reviews are somewhat all over the place but was very relieved to find it works fantastically. Looks good, sounds good, also works with Bluetooth very easily- only things I can say for some of the reviews saying there was no proper sound is possibly getting a defective one or maybe they didn't take off the protective piece over the stylus (or needle) also make sure your records are dust free as bits of dust can create pops and crackles. Oh I forgot to mention this thing can go pretty dang loud and thats awesome.

",4.0,Kimberly,"Reviewed in the United States March 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this for my niece for Christmas, along with a few records, to pass along the vinyl bug. It worked - maybe too well! I definitely created a monster who will need to be fed with new records and musical equipment for the rest of her life. Yay?The price point should tell you that this is no Technics 1200, but if you're looking for a fun gift, a record player for someone just getting started with vinyl, or a supplemental player for yourself (that's also highly portable), you won't go wrong here. There are an abundance of great colors and designs to choose from, and the Bluetooth option is nice. You can also supplement the sound with additional speakers if you'd like, or use your headphones or earbuds. As always, you get what you pay for, but this is a decent value for the low price. One quick caveat:  consider buying a decently sturdy slipmat (the felt, fabric, or cork piece that sits underneath the vinyl on most turntables) to use with this player - it doesn't come with one. I was lucky that I already had backups on hand to include with my niece's gift, because I was uncomfortable with putting vinyl directly on plastic. A slightly thicker slipmat seemed to provide the most stability to balance out the lower-cost components with which these turntables are made. Happy listening!

This is a plug and play machine, no exterior speaker needed though you can plug them in. It also gives you an aux port to listen via headphones to get the full vinyl sound.

   It arrived on time, I assembled it in about 30 seconds, and right away it worked exactly as described. For beginners just getting started with listening to records, or people who simply want to listen to a few records without spending much, this is a great deal.There are a few reviews complaining about the audio quality, and all I can think is “what did you expect for this price?” The sound quality is pretty good—certainly good enough for me to enjoy some old used classical music records like the one I attached here. If you want the sound quality to be *great* you’ll just have to plug in your headphones or spend more more money on high-end speakers. For the price, I really don’t know how you can beat this.

  Not the worst record player out there for someone who is just starting off, but the problems with it will quickly make you upgrade. The sound quality is very tinny, which can be really nice on things like swing music to really give a retro feel, but when you’ve just paid over $40 on an album you really want, then the sound is a problem. Worse is the skipping. Since there is no counterweight on the tone arm, this thing has a really bad tendency to skip. I had one 180 gram record play in about ten seconds because the tone arm skipped over the whole thing. If you do end up getting this, be ready with a quarter to place on the tone arm and glue or tape it in place, otherwise you’ll be resetting it over and over again.Honestly, it’s best to just save up and get something nicer.

Only issue was that I did not see anything in the instructions about removing the cover from the needle before attempting to play a record. Unpack it, put an album on, remove the needle cover (White) release the tone arm, lift the lever to the back of the player next to the tone arm, gently move tone arm over to album, lower with lever and relax while you listen to some good ole Elvis.

  I bought this for my grandfather for Christmas. I made sure it worked before wrapping it in the Christmas paper. The sound quality seemed to be quite well, though I haven't any idea how old records are supposed to sound. My grandfather has a large collection of old records he can no longer play because they no longer produce the needle for his old record player. I quite love the fact that Victrola includes an extra needle in the packaging. I didn't rate the quality of the bluetooth because I hadn't tried it.

  It's beautiful very 50's-esque. The sound quality is okay since the volume differentiates between the bluetooth and actual vinyls. It has the perfect aesthetic for listening to anything and everything from T-Swizzle to my boys Da Zombies. Totally fab, would def get again so mine can have a buddy. I would for suresies play two records at the same time and make the devil's music come to life but don't @ me because i'm all about my homie Jesus because #catholicism. Anyways... haven't traveled with it but i'm sure it would be ever so delightful. I once saw a video where a girl had like a portfolio in which she would put all her records in and I think you need one of those if you want to travel with it you know for convenience purposes. Yeah... I think she had some pretty banging records, including the original 1950 Disney Cinderella's Soundtrack which we all know is a banger. She also has some 45s which are the little records, I haven't tried one but it has the little piece for it so I'm sure it works, fingers crossed lol #haventtried #willtry #needtogetone #thinkingaboutit #butter

  Really pleased with this. I bought this for my art studio space in our attic. It's perfect for that purpose. Keep in mind that it is a suitcase record player and the speakers are what one would expect for a suitcase record player; not a wide range but a decent sound. If you're looking for a more dynamic sound, and lots of bass, then I would suggest finding some auxiliary speakers at the Goodwill and hooking them up. The mechanics feel solid. The tone arm has some weight to it. Bluetooth mode works seamlessly.Pleased as punch with this. I would buy it again in a heartbeat.

  To anyone who thinks this is going to sound like crap, you are correct. All small record players like this sounded like crap back in the day or they wouldn’t have invented digital sound. It’s still decent to listen to; but that’s not the goal. It LOOKS very nice and it has that staticky, tinny, vintage sound vibe of old vinyl records, so it hits all the marks for a VINTAGE record player.

",4.0,Steven Bear,"Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  For the price you do get a decent product. The onboard speakers adequately produce a vinyl sound but do not have a wide range to carry full high, mid, and low db clarity. The tone arm and stylus head are lightweight and will occasionally ""float"" across your vinyl. This sounds like you're missing/skipping through the song. I do have a fix for this though!!! Place a penny or nickel on the stylus head. This adds the extra weight needed to keep the needle in the groove and greatly increases clarity and accuracy while playing a vinyl.

  This is not for audiophiles. BUT, it works good enough for everyone else. The sound quality is good, crisp, and what I expected. The platter is smaller than a 12"", so I suggest getting a 7"" slip mat for better grip on the vinyl.  The speakers are not great, so don't crank it up, it will only blow out the sound. Headphones are great or Bluetooth or audio jacks; it's a tight unit.  Perfect as a first turntable. Do make sure to use the lock down clip and the pick up/lower lever.  Makes it last longer.

  This Victrola Turntable is a simple, yet usable purchase for both the avid record collector and the casual vinyl listener. The turntable is easy to use, and comes with detailed and understandable directions. It is bluetooth enabled, for the times when you'd rather listen to a song thats on your phone or tablet. As the description notes, it is portable - so you can turn it off, snap the top closed, and take it wherever an outlet is (with it's handy handle). This also makes it super convenient for storing, if you don't always have space for a turntable. It would easily fit under most beds, or stashed in the closet. HOWEVER, do not worry - just because this model is simple, and storable -- it still packs the same punch of nostalgia. The sound quality is good, and the table can be turned up loud enough to rock out to your favorite classics! I would recommend this item!

",2.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had high hopes for this player because the other reviews looked good, maybe the bad ones are buried idk, but this record player was a let down. I tried playing vinyls that were brand new and they skipped soooo much. I couldn't even listen to it, it was horrible. I thought maybe just the vinyls were bad so I put on a vinyl that I've had for a while and know for a FACT is in good condition with no scratches and it did the same thing. AVOID!!! Do yourself a favor and just find a record store near you, most of them sell record payers. Urban Outfitters also sells two brands that I've found to be pretty good - Boytone and Crosly. But avoid Victrola, don't waste the $$.

  The sound quality is pretty bad. By bad I mean I will never listen to it which defeats the whole purpose. I was pretty wary about buying it but read that other people hook it up to a different speaker&since we have a couple around the house I gave it a go. BUT, no matter what my boyfriend and I try, we cannot get it to connect to anything else! Read the instructions 100 times. I should have just returned it but didn’t want to go through the process.

  We wanted a record player for our young son, so we didn't need something with amazing sound quality. Just something simple & fun that WORKS, and this fits the bill. The sound quality is mediocre through the small speakers, but the player itself seems to work well (except one of our records with smoother grooves does skip). Definitely recommended considering the price point. And our son loves it.

  If you are looking for retro this record player is it. Right out of the box I plugged this in with my daughter and was very disappointed when I saw the speaker plug in the back thinking this was the only way to hear sound. Low and behold this is just an additional way. The sound reminds me of records playing back in the day. This is a great affordable piece of nostalgia and I do not regret this purchase.

  It's been fun to have the Victrola to play old records that we had in the house.Pros:It's easy to use and understand.It's fun to use.Cons:The sound quality is not great.The Bluetooth connectivity is to play music from your cellphone through the Victrola, and not to pair it with a better sounding speaker.I had to connect it with an aux cord to a speaker using the headphones jack to have better quality. For some reason, a little-sounding-music still comes out from the Victrola when connected to the aux cord, but nothing that affects the overall sound.I would recommend it if you are not looking for the best quality, but more to have some fun and rediscover old records.

  It's obviously cheap, so there's no question that it's not going to produce top notch sound. But the sound is TERRIBLE, even with external speakers hooked up to it. So if you're at all interested in quality sound, steer clear from this thing.It DOES look kinda cool and trendy when there's a record on it, but because of the heavy arm on the player due to cheap parts, it'll do more damage to your vinyl and cause more distortion. So either use it with records you don't give a damn about or put your microwave plate on this instead and let that spin.If you just want something to display in a room as a decoration piece, this is PERFECT!

After contacting the manufacturer for advice we ended up returning this piece of junk. It's very poorly-made - cheap, light plastics throughout. It looks nice, but isn't worth it.

The built in speakers work well but you don't get a lot of volume.  It sounds great on my speaker and I have a vintage look in the room.  Its an excellent purchase for those new to vinyl.

  As soon as I took it out of the box, I loved the white and rose gold color. I knew it wasn’t the most expensive record player but I expected it to work. The record wobbles ( I was told this is common with free standing/floating), but the needle just skips across the whole record! I then bought a cork underlay non skip mat. Still wobbly, still won’t play the record. I’m at a loss.

  I bought this record player for the portability factor and the brand. It’s overall a nice little record player. The original needle had a defect and caused poor sound quality. Switched it out with the spare one it came with and it seems ok now. The speakers are by no means high quality. Do not expect great sound like you do with a radio or car system. But they do sound ok for enjoying a record and that’s all you have. What is disappointing is when you hook up external speakers you can still hear sound out of the record player speakers. But overall it’s not too bad for the price.

  This is the first record player I have bought. My boyfriend had a bunch of vinyls with the plan to sell them so I got this to test them out, make sure they played.

I could turn the power knob and hear it click like it was trying to turn on but nothing else would happen. I read in the reviews that the power adapter could be replaced to possibly fix that problem but that didn't work for me. A new adapter didn't make any difference.

I am happy and it is good for a kids record player.ORIGINAL REVIEW: Stopped working after 55 days with no abuse to the player in the least bit. Of course it was outside the return window so now I'm stuck with poop. It also has a Bluetooth but you would think that it would be so you could connect to a better speaker. It's actually the opposite. You can connect your phone and whatnot via Bluetooth to play through the speakers. Why on Earth anyone would want to use these speakers other than for the record player itself I'll never understand. The speakers suck and not much better than your phone speaker. Find a better player and spend a little more if you have to.

  This is a really nice record player. The sound quality is what it is for the size of the speakers so don't expect hi-fi sound. However, there are a stereo pair RCA phono jacks output on the back of the player that you can connected to an external sound system for much better quality sound. You can also use the player as a bluetooth pass-thru. It's a very nice looking player that comes with a spare needle good for 50 hours according to the documentation. Unfortunately we decided to return it because my son thinks dealing with records is too much hassle.

  This thing would be the ""pop, crackle and skip"" of turntable cereals. I ordered despite the reviews hoping Id be one of the lucky folks to get one that functions well, and at best I got something half-decent. It pops, crackles and skips like nobody's business. It's definitely a ""you get what you pay for"" situation, but I suppose it does fine as an introduction to turntables, if you're ignorant to this sort of thing. At the very least now I know what to look for in reviews. Wouldn't recommend this one, although it's got some fine portability to it. It's quite small and very light, definitely not a pain to carry around at all. Downside is that it needs a powerplug to work, so you're kind of limited where you can set it up. Overall it's...decent for the price, so if you're looking for something to just get you into the scene without having to shart out big dollars, this would be the one.

The bluetooth is nice also.  Overall, super satisfied with it!

  Lots of options for output, none of which are particularly high quality. Yes, some of that does have to do with the vinyl, but the sound coming from any of the speaker options is tin can like. I'll experiment with some other options to improve the range adjustments and so forth, but let's just say it's not going to sound like your old sound system from the 70's.

  I really need to send this back. The needle does not stay on the record. It is not weighted properly. It's in a cute case and the concept of transporting it easily in its compact case is wonderful. However, it does not work. The turntable and needle may fall apart in the transport. Not a good choice unless you plan to keep it in one place. Not durable enough for a child under 12.

  This record player works amazingly, especially for the price. But the most useful thing about it is the size in weight. When the package first arrived i doubted the fact that the package was correct because of how light it was. Then when opening it seems to be too small to hold a regular sized vinyl, but i was proven wrong in both aspects.

  I wish I would have dived into the reviews a little more before I purchased.  I was looking for something at a reasonable price to play my 80’s vinyl collection.  What a disappointment, almost all my records seem to skip to the point it makes the music just not notable to listen to and the sound itself yikes!!! No bass built in at all, sounds like your listening to AM radio.  Very bad sound quality.  Wish I hadn’t purchased it but I’m too lazy to take time and box up to return for $50.

  This is my first record player. I don't know the technical stuff associated with record players yet, so I went for cute and cheap with the pink turntable. The sound quality isn't very good, but I love that you can hook up external speakers to it. The unit is actually very light and I'm pretty careful when moving it around. For the cost, I am happy with it although it will not serve as a long term record player I think.

  I love this record player, it's very stylish and portable, and also easy to plug in and get set up. The sound quality for records is excellent; for Bluetooth it is less so, but that doesn't matter to me a lot as I wasn't planning on using it as a speaker. Setup was so easy it almost didn't require a manual, but it comes with one, and both the box and case for the player were undamaged and clean. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a reliable, cute, and crisp- sounding player at a relatively low cost.

  This is a great product for an inexpensive player and will provide hours of entertainment. It will produce plenty of volume for a large room.  I had to send my first one back after only about 6 hours of playtime, as the turntable would not stop turning, obviously as it should.  Other than that, we have enjoyed it very much.  I have yet to put as much time into the replacement to see if it will have the same issue.

  My ""USA Flag"" turntable was delivered today and I have nothing but good things to say about it. First, it was packaged firmly and safely. And within 5 minutes of taking it out of the packaging, I was spinning my vinyl LP's. This turntable is so user friendly, and the speakers sound just fine. The bluetooth works perfectly and for the price being under $50, you cannot go wrong. I started collecting vinyl LP's again so I can re-live the memories of my younger years. And so far, Van Morrison, Bob Dylan, Elton John, and Creedence Clearwater Revival still sound AWESOME!👍🎵

  This phonograph is  a good deal for the price.  Nice for my daughter who has gotten interested in playing actual records.  My only complaint is that the item showed up on our front porch with no outer Amazon shipping box.  It was like someone purchasing the item in its box and putting it on our front porch.  First of all, the box was beat up and even open at the top.  Second, it was supposed to be a birthday surprise!  I cannot remember ever getting anything from Amazon in its original box and no other box to protect and conceal the item.  The phonograph seems to work all right, but I am disappointed in the shipping method.

  Makes for a cute decoration but unless you’re just spinning some old dinky records you got at a yard sale for five dollars you need to invest in a better player. This model has no counterweight, no antiskate and a very small platter (since it hangs off the side the disk will end up bending as it’s spun) so your records WILL be damaged- this is a guarantee. If that isn’t enough because there isn’t a counterweight the sound will be warbled and skipping. Audio-Technica has a good one for a hundred bucks, just use theirs.

  Great little turntable!  Some of my favorite vinyl is in 78 format and the fact that the Victoria had this speed setting was a big driver for me.  I also really like that it's a self contained, easily transportable unit.  The integrated Bluetooth was a nice, modern technology touch to this retro device.  The price point is excellent too.

  This is not a good record player. No matter what record you get this turntable will not play it correctly because the actually turntable that turns and plays the vinyl is smaller than the vinyl causing it to wobble. And since vinyls have grooves in order to play the music the vinyl will just skip or have a warp sound to it. I do not recommend buying this unit.

  I didn't expect the best sound quality out of this product based on the price, but I thought the bluetooth and AUX options would allow me to play the albums through another speaker. That isn't the case so there isn't a way to expand the sound of albums leaving me with these two sad speakers. :-( On a good note, it looks really cute sitting on our bar and gives me a feeling of nostalgia.

    Sound Quality is a bit weak without your own speaker set up
  
",4.0,Luigi Vampa,"Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2019","









  
  
    
  First off, I love this record player. I purchased the bright red color and it looks awesome.That being said, the sound quality of this record player without any kind of external speaker set up is just okay.I think it's fine for a record like The Times They Are A-Changin' by Bob Dylan, but for rock and roll records, in which bass is essential, the bass is barely audible. I would advise anyone who wishes to purchase this record player to also purchase an external sound system that you can connect to this record player to give your records more volume and power. Other than that it is a great buy and I have had no problems with it whatsoever (since I do have an external speaker system).

  Based on the reviews for this item, I expected a bit more. The sound quality of this record player is equivalent to the sound quality of my 3 year old son's Disney record player. Also, my record player came with tears on both corners of the top part of the record player. I don't recommend this record player to anyone with a refined ear for sound.

  I ordered it during black friday and even at that price it wasn't worth it for me. It skipped old records and a brand new out of a packaging too. It seemed to work better for the 2nd or 3rd songs, but the 1st song was horrible. It's very flimsy and I guess you get what you pay for. Returning ASAP and getting something else.

  The product per say was fine.  It was the fact that I ordered my Granddaughter the Flag one and received a plain black one.  I gave it to her as a Birthday present so instead of taking it out of the box first I let her unwrap.  The disappointment as she was expecting a flag one was very sad to me but she said she would just keep it as she wanted to listen to her album.  She is a a very patriotic person and this was upsetting to me!!

   It's a great record player, clear & crisp 👌 with the right sound system. The speakers aren't bad if you owned a studio or used it in a small area. However you want this to be in you living room, I suggest buying a sound system using an aux cord. The Bluetooth connection was confusing.

  It has been so fun to finally play records from the '60s that I have had in storage for so long.  Playing some of the children's records, comedy albums, and classical recordings that our family enjoyed so often in those years has brought back many great memories of simpler times when we would gather together around a record player. This Victrola copy even looks like the vintage one we had and the sound is authentic.  Such a great buy!!

  We were a little bit nervous after reading some of the reviews, but it seemed to be the best option for the price we wanted. While we were first setting it up we had trouble with the table; it was wobbly and would only turn a few times. BUT we found a small round piece under (top right of the part that spins) which was inhibiting it from turning all the way. After removing that part and placing it in the indent where it belongs, it worked great!! Haven't tried the bluetooth aspect yet. But with the record we've used so far it sounds great and was all we hoped for!! Hoping that continues.

  I purchased this for the BT features, which really isn't a feature at all.  Read the specs carefully as I got scammed.  I would be really upset but the record player plays on the phono settings - with average or adequate sound.If I'm wrong, please tell me how to connect my wireless speakers without the need for a RCA cord - which, by the way, doesn't work for me either.  I have a UE Boom, that I can't use.  Very unfortunate.

  Not the best out there, but definitely the best for people just getting into vinyl records. Sound quality is great until you get to a medium-loud quality. It depends a lot on how clean the vinyl you have is and the quality of it. It works without issues, is fairly straightforward, and has line in + Bluetooth in + aux/headphone out + RCA out features. Really great device for $40.  If you plan to get into serious or light vinyl collecting, I recommend you start out with one like this, then gift it to someone else and get a fancier one if and when your collection has grown. Anybody who buys this will be satisfied considering the player costs about as much two new vinyls.

  Great choice for a beginner on a budget. My 13 year old bought this herself and teaching herself. Yes the speakers are weak, but who cares! If you want better, pay more for a higher quality one. This serves or purpose excellently. She can take to get friends house, grandparents house, tech others the basics and super easily! Those bad reviews think they should get a Mercedes by investing $100. Have the correct expectations going in, this is budget friendly record player. Excellent for beginners and novices.

  If you are even considering buying a record player I'd like to take a moment here to thank you for helping to keep vinyl and physical music alive. This player works perfectly. I LOVE the color. Great quality. This is the cheapest, great quality one I found. At first I ordered one from Best Buy around Christmas time and they really disappointed me with telling me they were out of stock AFTER I had waited forever. So then I came on Amazon and found this one. I think Crosley is the most popular brand people are buying now, but this is exactly the same and cheaper. PLUS my grandmother said ""Victrola"" was the name on her record player back when they came out, apparently.

We tested those records on my husband's record player and there in no skip in the vinyl.  We changed the needle, and the records continue to skip.  I've tried reaching out to the manufacturer, and I'm hoping they'll work with us to make this right.  Of course the box was tossed in the recycling with the rest of the holiday trash.

  Ok, you’re not going to be mixing & scratching at the techno clubs with this, or kickstarting your DJ career...but if you want a solid entry level turntable to enjoy your collection of 300+ albums that have gone unplayed for 17 years, then yes, you’ll love it. Nice Bluetooth speaker so you can play your current playlists too. Again though, you’re not going to be turnin the party out with this thing.

  There is a design flaw with this product.

I removed the screws and disconnected the top to solve the problem. After reading reviews, many people are complaining about their music sounding distorted, and I wonder if this would fix their issue.

Here’s the problem: I hooked it up to some external speakers using both the red/white line out and the headphone jack and both still sounded terrible. If you dont care about audio quality, this is the turntable for you.

   I love it. This is good for beginners like me. You can also turn on the bluetooth for speakers. It is easy to operate and there are a lot of colors to pick. I think the quality is perfect for its price. The only thing that I don’t like is the quality sound of the speaker. Honestly, it’s not the best quality but as what I’ve said it’s okay because it’s not that expensive. I played Imagine Dragons and Coldplay vinyl and expecting my Taylor Swift vinyl in September.

  It's a super cheap turntable so you can't expect too much. The pros are its portable, lightweight, and plays through Bluetooth and aux cord as well as records.  The cons are its cheap plastic feel, the sound is nearly all treble, and parts like the needle seem easily breakable.  For its price though I'd say it's worth it.

  I'm new to collecting and playing vinyl, so I guess I underestimated how much a good turntable costs. $50 simply isn't enough for quality sound. The sound quality on this is quite terrible, fuzzy and tinny sounding. The plastic on it also feels cheaply made and the product feels cheap and flimsy all around. It gets the job done, I guess, it does play my vinyls, but it's not a good quality product all around.

  This record player WILL NOT WORK/PLAY on newly pressed vinyl!!! It will play old vinyl.

  This was my first record player. I was naive to buy something so cheap, but my friend got something basically identical from another brand and it works fine. From the first time I used mine it bounces and skips in the same spot on every record, I tried to fix it and missed the return period but It’s a piece of sh** that makes my favorite songs sound garbled and will damage my records if I keep trying to make it usable.

  The sound was actually decent if you kept the volume low. However, we played several different records and they all would skip at certain points on the album.

  Not of best quality.  Sound quality is poor and gimmicky. You cannot connect via BT to get better sound.You need to connect to a tuner/receiver for better listening experience. This limits mobility.Not recommended to connect your device because of poor sound quality.Overall good for beginners, who don't want to spend a lot.So what you see, is what you BUY. Should make a nice conversation piece.

  Cute, practical, and fun. I bought this Victrola record player for my dorm room. The bluetooth function makes it instantly versatile. Note that it must be connected to power, it doesn't have a battery like I first expected. The suitcase itself seems to be made out of a light wood, so it is not too heavy.

  I got this record player for my 13 year old daughter for Christmas! She loves it but when we first set it up it kept squeaking there was a plastic piece stuck under the turn table so we had to take it out. After that it sounded great definitely not the best of the best but it works well and sounds good. It is a big large in size though i'm not sure if it's normal for a record player? But it is great!

  It's cool and it worked fine. The biggest fault I'd say it has that the lid doesn't really have a stopper to stay open. So it can just slam shut on one of your records if you bump the lid, while open. So be careful! It happened to us within the first 3 minutes of using it.

  This is a low quality turntable that try’s to lure customers in with the Bluetooth gimmick and cheap price. But you get what you pay for in this case. These cheap turntables have poor quality arms, which can ‘skate’ across the record. This will scratch the record and skip your audio.If you are getting into vinyl and looking for a starting turntable, do not resort to this line of tables. They will ruin your records and turn you off to the hobby. Invest in a solid, study, reliable turntable.

  Ordered this item to allow me to play some old 33 record albums that I found among some of my dad's things. It plays beautifully and I am enjoying not only my dad's old collection but I can now share the storybook 45 records I saved from when my kids were little with my grandkids.  The sound quality is very good and, so far, I have had lots of fun with it! And you can't beat the price!  I  recommend it for casual, occasional use.

  I bought this to play my old 45 records and the old children's 45rpm  records for my grandchildren. It worked well, packed safely and arrived onetime.  It has been played at least 20 records in the last two days and sounds good.  For a low cost player I have no complaints.  I have not used the bluetooth and have no plans to use it.

This record player repeats and skips on every record I’ve put on it. Have had it for a week. Very disappointing. Returning it now. Just know 50$ players should come with an asterisk.

  The Functionality of it works with my Yamaha receiver which has a stereo selection, sounds pretty good. But when playing the 45 records, the song isn't done and it just stops and shuts off. Also, when it turns on or shuts off it sends feedback through the speakers, like a banging noise. Overall rating is a 3, it's nice to play my collection of original records.

  Good sound and easy instructions. However, if you are using colored vinyl where it may be a thinner record, I would advise putting a penny on top of the needle. The stylus is very light and only goes down so far. Put a little weight on it and no skips whatsoever. Other than that, I'm happy with my purchase!

  You get what you pay for. I have a couple vintage records from the 60s/70s that work fine, but newer vinyls skip like crazy. I've tested the newer vinyls on a different turntable and they work fine-- this thing is just cheap. A fix I've found is taping a penny to the arm when playing the newer vinyls-- the extra weight helps. Definitely a cute looking little record player, but if you're looking to collect vinyl records just save up and get yourself a better player.

   This is my first vinyl player and the first time I've ever used one. I was confused on why my vinyls kept skipping just to find out that it was not the player, it were the vinyls. I was definitely skeptical until I just bought Panic! At The Disco's latest album, Pray For The Wicked, and since it's brand new, it sounds amazing!!

  This product is cheaply made! Purchased this record player to get into vinyl. I was very disappointed with the quality and sound of this player. The unit is very light and made from thin plastic. Out of the box I got about two hours of playtime before issues began to arise. The sound began to distort and eventually became unbearable to listen to (I’ve used the brand new records) Returned and purchased a higher quality record player.

  It's cute as a novelty, or as a first turntable, but you get what you pay for. Mine wobbles pretty badly, so much so that it causes skipping that doesn't occur when the same record is played on other turntables. The sound is what I would consider headphone quality. Just ok if you're sitting right next to it, horrible the higher you turn it up. Bass is lost, high notes sound tinny.  All in all I'd say save your money and put it towards a higher end piece.

  this turntable isn't for audiophiles... it's fine if you're spinning old records at your bbq parties, but if you are looking for something to last for a bit under regular use, this is not it... inital quality is good but it quickly declines... within 2 months of light use (only a couple records per week), the speed noticeably slowed and the power/speaker volume switch is very touchy... also will not play 180g vinyl due to no balance weights on tone arm...i can't recommend this because if you spend $20 more, you can likely get something a lot better...

  Right out of the box mine had arrived sadly arrived broken. The turn table wouldn't spin and it wasn't picking up anything from the stylus. I tried out the AUX and blue tooth connection and they worked alright. The speakers are tinny sounding and have no bass to them, and I'm pretty sure its playing in mono.After taking it apart and fixing the problem, which was an issue with a really cheap connector, I got the record player working. The sounds was the same as with the AUX or blue tooth inputs but it does wobble a little. The record player parts are also very plasticy and cheap feeling.Not a bad machine for basically $40 but I do expect brand new items to arrive working...

  Not my favourite player by a landslide. The lid does not have any sort of retention, and can fall closed from a minor bump. This is catastrophic because the internal surface is smaller than a record, meaning it will slam down on your precious vinyl if you accidentally bump it. Also, the Bluetooth function was defective on my unit, although I hadn't intended to use that feature much anyways.

  I bought this record player for myself on my birthday three months ago and I absolutely love it. It is light, portable, has a great sound player and is a beautiful shade of red. Very easy to connect with your phone/ipad and does a great job as a speaker too.  Not only do I finally get to play all my old, vintage records, but it makes for a wonderful addition to my dining/tea room. Contemplating buying this as a wedding gift for my bestie. Highly recommend.

  It plays Bluetooth okay, but sounds a bit staticy. Completely useless as a record player. We've tried four or five records, brand new and previously played, and they all sound terrible.

I haven't dropped it nor have I broken anything it just went kaput on me.

  This is obviously a cheap player, but with a few adjustments/additions, it’s pretty much what I was looking for in an intro player. I had to glue a penny to weight down the needle so the records would stop skipping (but it works well for my aesthetic, and I chose a penny from my birth year, so it’s all cute). The biggest improvement that has saved my records is replacing the terrible needles that come with this. Buy some diamond tips and everything will be great.

  If I could give it a negative star I would. The bluetooth feature worked fine but the main purpose for buying a record player would be to play records which it didn't do successfully.Amazon should hold these companies accountable for selling products to their customers that don't work. It's unprofessional not to and takes advantage of those that also pay for a prime membership every year.

  This is the first record player I’ve ever owned. i was very  skeptical about what i was buying because i didn’t want to buy the wrong thing. it sounds really nice and none of my records skip/scratch. the only complaint i might have is that with my larger records they hang off the edge so you can’t close it while playing the music. But it’s pretty, it plays well, and it’s relatively simple to set up.

  I ordered this product with lots of hope because of the good comments, but received it and set it up. And it won’t even turn on. The power supply is all plugged in, I even tried multiple outlets to make sure enough electricity was getting to it but the power light won’t turn on. Highly don’t suggest because now I’m going to have to go through the return process which takes even more time out of my day

  Received this record player today. Although shipping was fast, that's really the only positive. My first concern was that immediately upon opening the outer Amazon box (which didn't have any outside damage), I saw that the manufacturer's outer box AND the record player box inside that was damaged. I don't understand why this was shipped to begin with -- this hole screams damaged item to me!?!  I've included images of this. Now, let's talk sound --  I get that it's only $50 and the sound isn't going to be superb but the sound is very hollow and tin-ny, not deep and rich. No base, all treble. The other issue is that the actual color is completely different than what is seen on Amazon and on the outside of the actual player box. And it's not because of online imagery having variances in shading/lighting, etc. What is seen on Amazon and the actual, live product packaging matches -- it's a light, vintage-era, sea foam-like turquoise. What is actually in the box is a turquoise blue. You can see the difference in the image attached. Not at all what I ordered or wanted. I will be returning and considering other players.

  I love the device itself but was disappointed that the needle on my machine was damaged before I even used it for the first time. Upon playing my first record I also found that there is a loose wire that causes an odd skipping sound by making the turntable jump. I keep having to push it further underneath to make it stop but it eventually wiggles its way loose again. I thought about returning it, but the hassle of it all stops me.

  1. DOA. This was the main gift at a special birthday party yesterday. It was exactly what the birthday girl wanted, and she was so excited. We plugged it in: nothing. Thought the cheap power supply might be the culprit, so we went to Goodwill to find one that fit the specifications. With the new (used) power supply, the turntable began to spin, but still no audio came through the speakers. After unplugging and replugging, we found that the record player had returned to its former, completely unusable state. Very disappointing.2. When the turntable was spinning, the two records we tried wobbled, as if the mechanism were unbalanced. Neither record was warped, and we tried two just to be sure.3. After opening the box, we saw that good old warning... You know, the product contains something ""known to the state of California"" to cause birth defects, reproductive harm, etc. I looked back at the product page, and this warning was not posted anywhere I could see. I would not have bought it in the first place if I'd been informed of the potentially hazardous content.

  The sound is great and the design is even better. We’ve already listened to old vinyls from relatives and bought vinyls from a local record shop. Streaming is neat, but there’s something about actually putting a record on and “listening to music”. Something boomers and millennials can both agree on and enjoy. 10/10 would recommend. Much wow.

  While the product is beautiful to look at, the unit within the record player connected to the platform where the record is placed is flimsy plastic that seems to sit too high.  It invites warping and I had to buy a record clamp, which ended up not working anyway.  The records we played subsequently skipped constantly despite these efforts.

  I loved the simplicity of the player, very nice aesthetics, easy to set up and use. There was a few new records that it would skip on some parts, yet on a more expensive player, the record played fine on those parts. All my old records it played without any incidents. This leads me to believe that maybe it has trouble some of the newer records as some of the newer records are thicker? I don't know, I just know that some of the brand new records it would skip on certain parts when my expensive player had no issues with those same records. Either way, it is a nice player to be able to just pack up and take with you.

  bought as a Christmas gift for my son. After trying several albums, new and vintage...cannot get it to play at the right speed. At first we just thought my old LPs were the problem but after several months and purchasing many different LPs none will play properly. They all play too slow even no matter what speed setting we use.

  Okay, so this is on the cheaper end of the list for record players on this site. It has an attractive aesthetic and simple design. The speakers are pretty weak so I will be connecting better speakers. It plays old records fairly well but almost invariably skips on newer records (these are a bit thicker). I am considering sending this back but I am a pretty casual record collector. Of course, this would be inadequate for passionate listeners...

When it does play for a few seconds the sound is awful turn the volume up all the way and it’s still very quiet. Do not buy this product it’s a waste of money

  Overall i give it a 4! Its actually really great! The sound quality could be better if it came with a better stylus so id suggest investing in that. If it came with a better one i would have given it a five! The speakers arent super high quality but that gives it an almost vintage sound. Overall very worth it as its not expensive.

  My wife picked this out to play some recorded she recently discovered from her youth..  it plays the 33 1/3, 45's and 78's just fine.. it's not a bad looking box.you can pair it to a Bluetooth speaker or a cable that has the rca (mini) plugs, and then you can use an amplified external speaker. if you are wanting decent sound, you might want to consider doing that,  it has speakers, and the music comes out, but they are not of any quality. they get the job done, the best way to describe the sounds that comes out of this is . tolerateable..  .at $45 you cannot expect high quality sounds..

   The color on the Turquoise Aqua is way off. The picture makes it look like it’s a mint similar to the ice blue Kitchenaid color. It’s more of a Robins Egg Blue, which unfortunately doesn’t match anything I have. It’s a lot darker and brighter than the color shown. Will update review after I use it.UPDATE: Works great. The speakers aren’t the most spectacular things but you can always hook up separate speakers. I’m happy with it for my first record player.

",4.0,Craig Day,"Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2015","









  
  
    
  Updated review: Nice features at price-point; newly received ""black"" model arrived in good shape and has a feature that the blue one didn't -- the volume/power knob also turns on the bluetooth discovery function whereas the blue unit had a separate switch for the bluetooth. I like the black model's design, one less switch to break and more straightforward to sync.  Sound is good but not great (as expected from two small built-in speakers), stereo sound is evident.  I like that this model stops the turntable automatically when arm at end of record (no auto return of arm), another portable unit I have does not do this. Solid four stars now for product, one start missing due to poor assembly on first model and inconvenience of needing replaced (unit very ""plasticy"", could have used more metal and less plastic on some parts to inspire confidence that it will last a long time). OLD REVIEW FOLLOWS: Ordered light blue model, arrived by Prime as expected.  Box in decent shape, but the item arrived defective (poorly manufactured).  One screw missing from top deck, one other screw had completely come out of top deck and was jammed under turntable (no evidence of shipping damage -- my guess is screws were stripped when installed and simply fell out during shipping -- though who knows where the second screw went?).  Something heavy has come loose inside of the turntable cabinet and slides back and forth upon tipping, presumably once held in place by one or more of the same missing screws.  The turntable functions well enough despite missing/loose components (one speaker not working) that I'm willing to give it another shot with a replacement... though the blue one is now backordered until after Christmas. Amazon Customer Support was great re. replacement options, trying again with a black one.

  First off, I don’t know much about record players, but I know that they aren’t supposed to be nearly as wobbly as mine is.  It often skips while playing my vinyls, but I fixed that by taping a penny to the needle.  The volume is great and the Bluetooth connection works just fine.  Other than that, the color of the player in the picture and on the box is completely different from the actual product.
