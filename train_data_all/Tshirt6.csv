  Fruit of the Loom's products are always well made.  These shirts are no exception.  Material is just the right thickness; length is correct for my height and intended use, and the material is soft on the skin.

  Although overall quality looks good, there was some shrinkage after washing once.  It's a tight fit with very good length.  Might want to order size larger if you want a looser fit.  I chose all cotton, so should have realized some shrinkage.

  At 5'11, I don't usually need to order Tall length shirts.  I've learned, however, that white t-shirts usually are made of realtively cheap cotton fabric and shrink in length significantly.  Having learned my lesson, I order these in Tall and find that even though they shrunk a little in lenth, it was relatively minor and the shirts still are long enough to stay tucked in.  If I were a few inches taller they would still be long enough.  Not sure they would stay long enough for someone at 6'4"" or 6'5"".

  I really like these shirts and had bought them at local Walmart until they stopped selling them.  They are a 50/50 cotton poly blend, they are a thin undershirt.  I like them cause they seem to retain their length after washing.  I hate buying undershirts and after washing they fit like belly shirts.  I like them cause they are thin material wise, which I stated above, I don't like my undershirts to be thick. They have a modern fit to them, so if you are looking for a boxy shirt, look elsewhere. I will continue to buy them as long as they make them.

  My husband has a very long torso, and a very flat rear end. This causes his crack to be visible every time he lifts his hands or bends over. I keep telling him he needs to change professions and become a Plummer.Anywho, these shirts are awesome. I’ve thrown out all the old white shirts and replaced them with these. They also hold up and wash well. I just soak them in bleach water periodically to keep them nice and bright.

  Big fan of these shirts so far.  A couple things to know:-They are ""Stay Tucked"" because they are longer.  A lot longer.  In the photo, I am comparing these to a Hanes ComfortFit shirt, and you can really see the size difference.-In the roughly 2/3 months of wearing these, they have stayed pretty soft!-The sleeve size is pretty small.  This is important if you wear a lot of polos as you don't want your sleeve of your undershirt sticking out.  Has not been a problem for me with any of my polos.  (see photo for sleeve size).Overall, I really like these.  I wasn't sure about the extra length but it really does help my undershirt stay tucked and not bunch around my waistband, an issue I've had with other undershirts.

  Ordered these having no experience with the brand. I usually use Hanes but thought I'd try something new. These are the worst fitting T's I have ever purchased. The neck sits well below mine and the stiching is cumberson. The sleeves flair out from mu shoulders to my biceps and I cannot keep them from curling up. The cut makes the shirt tight across my shoulders. The cotton in the shirt is still stiff, even after 7 wash cycles. The only good thing I can say is they are long enough for my 6'3"" frame. I weigh 195 lbs, so weight is not an issue in fit. Keep searching... I'm gonna have to!

  The shirts I got are of good quality.  Ordered XXXLT, and they fit well.  They will shrink some, as should be expected.  The shirts loose a star because they shed a ton in the dryer.  Even several months later they still loose a lot, although the shirts don't seem too much worse for it.There is a real problem, however, with being able to order these again.  When I ordered the first time, at $22.49 (the same price at the time of this review), I received a pack of six.  Now, when I link to the item from my previous purchases, the description indicates it is a pack of three, the photo indicates a pack of six.  Essentially, it appears this is NOT the same product I ordered, then, and I'm glad I read the details prior to reordering.  It appears many other customers are confused as well.  Questions posed by other Amazon customers for clarification of quantity seem to indicate they are a pack of six but may also be five.  One customer said they received only three.  There is just too much uncertainty to justify ordering again.  I don't remember seeing any other item on Amazon where you have to gamble on what you might actually receive.  It would seem that Amazon could easily get it together on this item, but from the number of questions they receive regarding what the actually quantity you will receive is it appears they show little interest.For that reason, I don't recommend ordering these, at least not until Amazon can definitively address all the conflicting information in the product description.

  These undershirts are so close to being perfect. I love the length and quality. However there is one big problem that forced me to return them. The collar is too wide. Besides the awkward feel of having so much collar bone exposed, the bigger problem is that, because the collar doesn't line up with a dress shirt collar, these undershirts show under a dress shirt. Having a circular ring show through my dress shirts because the undershirt collar is too wide is unacceptable to me. If anyone knows of a long mens undershirt that doesn't have this wide collar problem, please write me in the comments. Thanks!

  I ordered the classic large for my brother in law a week ago, while the upper body fit was good, it was way way too long (probably around 6 inches). He is about 5 feet 6 inches. I was disappointed because I specifically choose not to order the tall man fit because I knew he wasn't overly tall, so I didn't expect to get a tall fit (maybe they mixed up my others, idk). It was soft though and the material looks lasting but boy will he have to tuck them t-shirts in, smh.

  I’ve bought these shirts a few times, I like them because they don’t tend to shrink.  My last batch did after about 3-4 washes.  I wear an undershirt daily so that’s no good.  Bought these again and washed for the first time, we’ll see how it goes.  Normally they hold up well and fit great, hoping the last batch and an anomaly.

  I've been looking for some replacement undershirts for dress shirts for awhile now. According to the size chart I should have ordered a Large, however I ordered XL instead since that's always the size I order. Fit was perfect, and it only shrank maybe 10 percent or less after washing. They are long and stay tucked. Not a shirt you could wear casually, it is definitely an undershirt. I'm 6"" 210lb, dad bod+ and not slim.

    Good taper undershirts but shrink after just one cold wash
  
",4.0,Chien-Hao W.,"Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2021","









  
  
    
  I was on the look to replace my old Gap undershirts (good quality and fabric) and came across these FOTL taper ones. I am 5'11/ 150 lbs with a flat stomach and 37 in. chest so instead to buy what i am familiar with, i decided to go with FOTL taper undershirts in size Medium.The item arrived in one piece and good packaging. For sizing, I did a measurement on the garment when brand new just to see if they shrink after wash( which they did, but I'll get to that later). I wear size S in Gap but was in between S & M in FOTL and glad I went with bigger size as it turned out they run a bit small (refer the last two photos for the actual fit).The fabric is soft and the neck rib is good. These shirts are longer than my Gap ones, and I expect these to stay tucked in as they claim. Also the hem width is about a inch smaller than the chest width so they are true taper cut, which fit me nicely with no excess fabric when I tuck it in. They do have seams on the sides so these are not tubular shirts that are commonly seen. Anyway the first impression is very good. I would say the fabric weight is between 4-5 oz.However, some things changed a bit after just one (cold) wash. They shrink. Especially in length(about 1.5 inch shorter) so they do bounce up at waist from time to time during my one-month use. That's why I rate these 4 star but not 5.  Also the shoulder/chest width became smaller after wash, but not as much as the length so I guess I am fine with it.Overall these are good undershirts. I might try size large for above reason the next time but now I am still happy with the purchase. Hope this helps anyone.

    STAY TUCKED is a slogan, not a different length.
  
",2.0,©ooper,"Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2019","









  
  
    
  I got the answer to my question, whether ‘Stay Tucked’ is longer than others, or only tall sizes were longer (since Talls are >50% more expensive). ‘Stay Tucked’ is nothing more than a slogan. I also ordered colored cotton tees not labeled as ‘Stay Tucked’. The packages (other than one is a 5 pack and the other 6. And the color shown on the model) are identical.I have an order arriving tomorrow of XL TALL size. I’ll update my review once I compare the two. I also have Gildan brand, so I’ll compare all three.But, if you’re ordering Stay Tucked because you think they’re longer than others, think again. All Fruit of the Loom tees say “Stay tucked” on the package (not on the shirts). The shirts only vary by the size ordered.Update - The XL TALL tees arrived today. And they’re going back. Keep in mind tall sizes are a lot more than regular sizes (XL are ~$2.50 each. XL TALL vary from ~$3.75 to $8.33 depending on vendor). So what do you get for 1 1/2 times the price? About 2” longer (2 1/2” maybe, because the shirts vary from front to back). I measured them back to back, new, right out of the package. The point being, it’s not a lot. If the difference in price was as small as the difference in length, I could understand. I bought a 5 pack of Gildan tees that are about the same as FotL for $10 ($2 each). This is not clothing that will last forever. If they get a stain or rip, or just wear out, they become rags. And if you wear them untucked or as undershirts, the regular sizes work fine. They even stay tucked.And, Tall sizes don’t have their own bag. They come in a generic FotL bag that only says it is not a toy. Nothing about the contents.

    These Shrink - a LOT
  
",4.0,Nicholas J. Mariasi,"Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2018","









  
  
    
  Pros:- Very inexpensive - the price is more than fair for what you get- Pretty good quality from what I can tell (not scratchy/loose strings)- Extra length so they stay tuckedCons:- They shrink an insane amount after just the first wash- They get a bit less comfortable the more times you wash them no matter how expensive your detergent/fabric softener is- They're very thinThere's not much to say about this exactly. They are just regular shirts but with an extended length so they stay tucked in under a dress shirt. Functionally, they work great - I've even bought a second package just because they do what they're meant to and they do it well. The only problem I have with them is that they shrink a lot after just the first wash. I guess that's where the extra length comes in handy though - if any other shirt shrank this much then there would be a problem.I wear a button up shirt to work every day and these shirts have never done me wrong. I actually hate wearing any other regular white shirt under my button up's. They usually end up rising up too much and bunching up around the waist - not a good look.In the end - I put that they do fit as expected. I would say that brand new they fit as they should. Though, if I was you - I'd probably size up and wash them as soon as you get them, you'll probably end up with a better experience. Overall though, they're pretty thin so I would probably feel a bit weird just wearing them standalone - but they're great as an undershirt. What more could you really even ask for? Yeah quality is nice, but if it's going under your shirt, who really cares? Spend the extra money on a better shirt to go over it and thank me later.

  I am one of those old-school middle-aged guys who wears a white t shirt under my dress shirts to work every day. I'm typically somewhere around a medium or large in size, kind of on the borderline between the two. I usually buy size medium undershirts so that they will actually fit under my dress shirts (larges are typically too lose around the midsection for me). However, lately I have noticed that size medium undershirts in some brands feel a bit too tight and small to be comfortable. I decided to try these Fruit of the Loom ones based on reviews stating that these run a bit big for their size. While they seem fairly standard in the chest and shoulders for a size medium, what I find is that they run longer than other brands. This is a good thing for me, because they actually do stay tucked in while some of the competitor brand ones do not. These undershirts also have some stretch to them so they don't feel restrictive. All-in-all a pretty good fit and a good value at this price. If you are looking for a basic white t shirt to wear under a dress shirt or polo and are between sizes, this may be a good option for you.

  I am 6'4 250 lbs, and typically wear an LT or XLT T shirt.  I was excited to find these as I normally spend the same amount on one shirt as the whole six pack of these costs.  Unfortunately, they are very loose around the neck and look sloppy when wearing a collared shirt after a few washes.

  It's hard to buy clothes when you are tall, and nowadays nothing seems to be as great as the stuff I bought 20 years ago.  That being said, this T-shirt is the best one I've worn from all available options.  I've tried a few.  Will this T-shirt last a year?  I've been ordering these every 3 months for about a year.  They slowly shrink over time.  I stretch them every time I pull them out of the dryer (and I always dry on the LOWEST Heat setting and wash in cold water).  Like I said, these aren't perfect, but there the best I've come across.

  These have been a game-changer for my office wear, no joke. I didn’t realize how disgusting my old undershirts were until I got these in. Soft fabric, PERFECT length for tucking them in. Please note - they are way too long to wear untucked... they’ll hang out below your shirt. They do shrink the first wash/dry cycle but were long enough initially that it didn’t have an impact on the “tuckness”. They are slimmer fitting in the chest/arms area. I’m 6’0”, 175, size L for reference.

  I bought these shirts to wear around the house and also sleep with. Some of these colors are nice but the one I would stay away from is the light stone gray color. These shirts are cheap so I can't complain much about the quality. I bought these to wear indoor and sleep with. Definitely do not recommend wearing these casually outdoors as the color fades very easily and looks dull.One thing I will say is that the Large fits nice and I'm 5'10. The length is perfect for me and shorter on the arms which I like. I have washed them multiple times and the color on some of the shirts like the black ones have faded a bit but thankfully it has not shrunk.

  Just received these shirts today and handed the package to my husband.  There was something under the plastic on the top shirt and my husband said it looked like a clothes moth.  I looked at it with a powerful magnifying glass and it looked more like a tiny piece of beige fabric but next to it there was a tiny translucent oval amber object that looked like an insect egg.  This alarmed me so I saw another speck under the clear plastic and it looked like a young dead bedbug.  I immediately bagged the t-shirts up in a plastic trash bag since the bag they came in had some rips in it and it is now in the garage. I am debating whether to take them back or wash them on hot & dry them on hot which will kill any insect or eggs.  I am really freaked out but I have heard of this happening to others.  I would have taken pictures but I don't think my camera could get a close up very clearly and I don't want to unbag them.

  I was concerned my 17  year old boy might not like the longer fit and he wasn't around to ask when I ordered, but he absolutely loves these tees. They fit great, are long enough to stay tucked in but not ridiculously long. Nice weight to them. Not beefy but not paper thin. He wears them under dress shirts.

  In almost all brands and styles, I wear a medium. These are undershirts, expected to fit a bit more snug than a regular shirt, so a medium should be scaled down appropriately to work as an undershirt. They are freakin tent like, thin, and the collar is loose like a worn out wizard's sleeve.Absolute garbage product, buy literally any other undershirt before buying these.

  One thing is for certain. These shirts will not become untucked. They’re very long and travel past my groin just before the top of the thigh. These shirts are a little on the thicker side, and do not wick or air out the best. But for your everyday shirt that you gotta keep tucked, then look no further this is the deal for you.

  I bought these because of all the positive reviews.  After washing the shirts, they are night-and-day different and literally half the size that they were.  I am not a body builder but the sleeves are so tight that they make it look like I am.  Almost everything described about these shirts in other reviews is not the case with the batch that I bought.  They were super-discounted so not sure if they were being offloaded due to being the wrong size or what.  Suffice to say I am sending them back because they are not soft at all and are terribly uncomfortable.

  Not yet washed, the 'Stay Tucked' version is a full 4"" longer than the standard 'Fruit of the Loom Men's 5-Pack Crew Neck T-Shirts' that I've been wearing and not liking the past year or so - for the simple reason that they are cut too short for an average size torso.

  My husband is tall, and I had a hard time finding T shirts for him that don't shrink up too short in length. These hold their shape, they're long enough to stay comfortably tucked when he wants, and they wash well. He likes these so much that I'm now ordering him more, so I can just donate the ones we recently bought that he felt were ""too flimsy"". I do hope this product remains available.

  These stay-tucked T's fit well, have the length to stay tucked in, and are comfortable thanks in part to the tagless design,  The lower rating I gave was due to the weight or thickness of the material used. They seem to be about half the weight of the material used in my older Fruit Of The Loom  T's which have held up well for years,  I don't think these newer, lighter shirts will last nearly as long.

We'll use them for rags.  We've been using Hanes for years, same size, XL, without any shrinkage.  Go to any other well known brand.  Such a disappointment. The FOTL were also scratchy.

  Best fit on the market for me - 6’1” - I wear a size medium tall and this is right in line with that size, but tighter as it is an undershirt meant to be tucked.  The sleeve length is perfect, too - these won’t stick out of my polos.  The collar is firm and fitting so it look professional, too.  I was a lifelong Hanes tshirt guy - never again.  Hanes collars start to curl due to their smaller size and strong understitch; plus they are way too short and untuck when reaching.I would buy these shirts if they were pricier than Hanes, but they aren’t!  Amazing!  (Unfortunately sometimes I expect the pricier item to be better, then suffer at my own expense; glad I figured it out this time.)

  I have been wearing these for about 15 years,  they last forever, fit perfect, and look good. The only reason I gave THIS 4 stars is because the cotton doesn't seem the same as all my other ones. Lint never sticks to my old ones, but these ones get covered in lint the moment I put them on. Idk if they stopped using the same cotton or if it is the dye. I haven't had to buy new ones in years since the others last so long. Still good shirts. Maybe after a few more washes the lint problem will stop. Also they seem to not clean my glasses as well as the older ones do, probably due to the same issue. They are soft, with age my others got super soft and comfy. I hope these ones do the same. I'll be really sad if it ends up changing.

  If I could split stars between the general shirt quality and shirt condition, I'd do 4 stars for quality and fit, and 1 star for condition.  One round of shirts was ordered (at full price) and they were new and in good condition, the collar seems flat so far, and they were just as desired with regard to shirt length - longer than typical undershirts that don't stay tucked.  (Note:  size was selected assuming the shirts would shrink a little.  If you don't take that into account, they might be shorter than you want.)So, since the first set worked out nicely...I ordered another round (12 shirts total) and was pleasantly surprised that they were discounted.  Well, nowhere did I read anything that the likely reason for the discount was that all of these shirts appear used (with black marker through the label), about half had an obvious stain or flaw, and out of four packages of three, one package seemed to contain a completely different product even though packaging was the same.  (that set of three had some different wicking fabric for the underarm.)  Various stains on outside and inside, a few tiny holes...they are intended to be worn under other shirts and will definitely be washed first, so I'm keeping them, but I'm unhappy to have received used products with no warning and no way to know ensure that I was ordering new products.

Surprisingly, these were not short like some other brands, but certainly not tall and drying on delicate cycle, have no complaints with the regular size. But, if I am paying retail, I would still buy the tall.... they stay in your pants all day and can dry on regular cycle with a little shrinkage.

  I am one of those people who wears undershirts, because they are made of cotton, which is gentler on the skin than the synthetic and blended fabrics that my wrinkle-free shirts are made of, so the cotton goes directly against my skin, while the polyester and acrylic fabrics of the shirts stay off my skin. These undershirts are made of a thin material, which is good because I live in the warm-to-hot climate of southern California. I will be buying a bunch more of them, and I recommend them as a good value and a comfortable fit.

I am 5'11"" and 185 lbs and I had been buying tall t-shirts in a large for a while to make sure they stay tucked in with a dress shirt, but no tall size is necessary with these.  I bought a Large, and these will absolutely stay tucked in all day long, no matter what.  The material is nice and quality seems to be good so far.  The cut is not too wide, and not too slim, and the neck opening is a very good size for me.  I read some complaints about a wide neck, but I don't have that problem at all.Overall this is a good quality shirt with a very good fit for me.  Not a bad find for less than $15 for a 6 pack!

I assumed that the mens medium would be if anything, bigger. I was wrong. The mens medium fit me way tighter than my womens shirt in medium by them. I know it's not how I laundered them either, because I followed the instructions and used cold water and low heat. I wish I could return the item or get my money back but sadly I jumped the gun and washed them where I could wear it the next day only to realize it fit skin tight.

  Nothing to complain about the quality of work to make the T-shirts, but what cloth (material) they chose to make them with is unbelievably bad.  Maybe once they were using higher quality cloth because of so many reviews praise them and some say they are much better than another known brand.  I was looking forward for them because of those reviews.  What I got are with like the canvas cloth that has been beaten to smooth it out.  Washing them won’t help.  Can’t use them for animals because that’ll be an animal abuse.  Choose Hanes or something better.

  They are extra long, hence the stay tucked, so I'd wear this around the house, but not much anywhere else, unless I am using it as an actual undershirt. The sleeves are shorter than a normal t shirt so they don't show when being used as an undershirt. A major issue I have, however, is they are REALLY wrinkly even if you pull them fresh out of the dryer. They're nice for the price, but I can't see myself purchasing these again, only because I was looking for something I could use as both an undershirt and casual wear. The wrinkles and the extra long length make it so I can't use it for casual wear, unless I plan on staying home.

  These shirts are okay and certainly reasonably priced.  But they seem to run small.  Either that, or they shrunk considerably in a cool-water wash.  The material is also pretty light weight.  They're not awful but not fully what I expected, either.  They'll work okay as an undershirt but not for wearing as a casual tee with jeans.  Had I gotten a larger size, they might have been fine.  Their tuck-in length doesn't seem to be any greater than any other tee shirt I've owned.  Also, the sleeves are about half the length of those on all my other tees.  They look kind of ridiculous if I were to wear the shirt without something else over it.  Again, perhaps shrinkage.  But they were washed in cool water just as I do with all my other tees that seem to fare better.

    Just What I Was Looking For
  
",5.0,Chad Woolley,"Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2016","









  
  
    
  These are great undershirts - soft, comfortable, perfect sizing.  In the past, I had to have several different types of undershirts depending on what wearing - some had large neck but also longer ""short"" sleeves, so they would stick out past short sleeved shirts.  Others had shorter sleeves, but higher, small necks - would look funny poking out of many shirts (I wasn't going for a Catholic priest look).  V-neck undershirts never worked, btw.So what I needed was 1) A loose neck with 2) shorter sleeves, so that would work in any situation.  Finally found what I was looking for!

  Love these shirts. The extra long is great. Never have an issue with them coming untucked in all kinds of conditions and different kinds of pants. I never go to anywhere without one of these on underneath my clothes if the outfit needs it. They do look a little silly if you wear them as a regular t-shirt because of the length (for my body type anyway) but underneath is great.  Quality is good too. No ripping or wear even with frequent use

    Great undershirts
  
",5.0,The Notorious MCC,"Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  These are my favorite t-shirts for wearing as undershirts and for working out.  The sleeves are bit shorter than a normal t-shirt, which makes them ideal to wear under a short-sleeved shirt because they don't peak out from underneath.  They also flatter the biceps while working out.  The extra length is great for me because while I'm not overly tall, I have a large belly and the extra length keeps that from being exposed when raising my arms or otherwise stretching my torso.  I have purchased 3 sets of these shirts and found the sizes on all of them to be perfect and consistent.  While there was some slight shrinkage I have not experienced as much as many of the other reviews on Amazon, but I do take care to wash with cold water and tumble dry on low heat.

  I've always bought the standard white tees, and they usually get untucked. These are obviously meant to help fix that, so they have a good length that you tuck in and don't have to worry about the rest of the day. Using a urinal is not a hassle at all, as these aren't so long that they make it a hassle. Perfect length and great quality product.

Yes, they're longer than average, but not quite as long as a dress -- unless you're into that, which is okay. I tuck them into my undies, so that they don't bulk up and/or fold up under my tucked in button down shirts. They work great. Will they last a lifetime? No. Are they worth the money? Yes. They'll hold up long enough to see you through.

Bottom line, these are great and I'm happy with the purchase.I'm 5'8"", 185# and wear a 42 suit jacket. I went with the Large and they fit great, not baggy at all but not super snug. They are longer than I was used to with my other shirts, but I don't think that's a bad thing, just be aware they're slightly longer than what you might expect. They are light-weight, and because they are a blend I don't expect they'll shrink much, if at all.

  I struggle finding an undershirt that is the right size in the right places. They’re always to short I’m in length or the sleeves are too long and stick out of your over shirt. This one is just right. Stays tucked in all day and the sleeves are short enough to stay hidden under a golf polo.

    New Thick, Itchy Side-Seams; Big Downgrade
  
",3.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  I’ve been wearing these undershirts for years and have enjoyed the collar fit and softness. After reordering, I’ve discovered they now include seams down the sides that were previously not there. They are uncomfortable, distracting, itchy, and a massive downgrade from the previous products. How are you going to get rid of collar tags in the spirit of comfort, and then add massive, full length seams?!Additionally, the collars have gotten a little wider. Not to the point it bothers me, but guys who like snug, tight collars may see it as a negative.I don’t know why something so basic can’t be left alone but I guess I’ll be looking elsewhere next time - the last thing you should be noticing all day is an undershirt, but these annoy me all day.

  I bought a 5 pack of these shirts to replace some older shirts that were stained or just getting worn out. They arrived quickly and they fit as expected. However, when they were washed they emanate an odor that smells between hot tar and a burning odor. It seems primarily on the grey shirts and perhaps it is because of some additive? The shirts say Dual Defense so is that some additive that is heat activated? When the shirts are cold, they have the odor but when the shirts are in the sun they reek. Never had a problem with this brand in 50 plus years so guess it's time to change to something else.

  I've been wearing Fruit of the Loom undershirts for over 20 years now.  Size and quality has been pretty consistent, but these shirts run way large.  Have the torso of the shirt loose is not a big deal, but the problem is that the neck is also scaled-up, so out of the package it's super-loose, and this will only get worse over time.  It's like they just packaged a size larger shirt, named it ""stay tucked"" and called it a day.  I had to order a size down to get the correct fit... now I have 6 brand-new rags in the shop.

  To be honest, I really didn’t do much research before buying these undershirts so my expectations weren’t too high when they arrived. However, I was pleasantly surprised!The t-shirts are lightweight, comfortable, and the collar stays flat all day. Two things I noticed about these undershirts are that they’re thinner than most other undershirts which I don’t mind personally but I’d understand if others would. The other is that they’re longer which I find nice because the shirts stay tucked and don’t bunch up at all. As far a size goes, I typically order a size smaller so that the shirts are more form fitting (I’m 5’8” 145lbs) and a small fit perfectly.Overall, I’m very happy with my purchase and would highly recommend these undershirts to anyone looking to buy new ones. Hope this helped!

  I bought this pack to use at the gym, so my standards were pretty low to be honest. I just wanted something with no labels and easy to use.They fit well, they are not super soft (hence the 4 stars), and don't look super cheap. Move pretty well with them doing all kinds of weight lifting and using machines plus cardio.Just be sure to pick the correct pack/option. I don't know why there are so many to choose from it makes everything confusing.

They are seriously not much thicker than a gauze bandage.  So irritated I had to take a picture.  It may be hard to see my hand but if you look close you'll get the point.  Such a shame because the two previous purchases of this same item were right on point.

  I am giving this 3 stars because what was delivered to me was, in fact, 8 white shirts. And surprisingly they fit. So no false advertising there.But the quality... For shirts that are $2/each, you won’t be surprised how poorly they’re made. I felt the seams rip putting on the shirt for the first time. I didn’t dare attempt to wash these, but I can only imagine these cotton shirts in the wash would shrink tremendously. On top of that, they’re very see through, so they can be used as undershirts only.So buy at your own risk. If you need some quick, cheap undershirts, then these will work for you. But if you’re looking for a shirt that’ll last any amount of time, buy something else.

  These are the best t-shirts as far as fit, in my opinion. I’ve probably gone through 100 of them since they first started making the “stay-tucked” version. I do wish the material was a little softer, but with fabric softener they are good enough. I wear medium as undershirts and large as a regular t-shirt. I’m a muscular/athletic build.

  I purchased these for my significant other. He was frequently complaining of the competitor brand he had always purchased. Especially after they were washed and dried he always noted that they shrunk on the sleeve length as well as the length of the shirt itself. Although he does not tuck in his undershirt, Was hoping to find a white undershirt that would not ride up beneath his Outer shirt.  After washing and drying this product he was pleasantly surprised to have found a T-shirt that didn’t shrink too much. He still referred to it as fitting perfectly. I will note that he did not follow the wash instructions he used fabric softener and washed with warmer water and dryed them on low heat. However, even after these factors this white undershirt T-shirt fits perfect and will definitely be something we purchase again. I would definitely recommend it it is an excellent quality and a great value

  Bought these for my husband. Got them for a great deal and liked that they ran long because other white undershirts tend to shrink quite a bit after a couple washes. These stayed long but not too long. The one thing I would complain about about these shirts is that the sewing is off which makes folding them difficult due to sides not lining up. If you place a few up next to each other, they're not close to being almost identical.

  I am disappointed in the black shirts.  I have white, and they are great; the two out of five gray ones that came in this pack are great.  The black ones start way long, and I thought they would be great.  MAJOR shrinkage after first wash.I bought these in hopes that they would not shrink like the other black ones I have, but there must be something in the black fabric.  All other undershirts I have, multiple colors, all shrink way way way less than the black.These shirts are still slightly longer than the Gidlan's, but with how much they shrunk at the lower end, they also shrunk equally at the top end.  I'm not a huge guy by any stretch, but this got tight across the chest and biceps.  If you have any sort of gut, expect it there too.  Mine isn't big enough to pull up on the bottom of the shirt, but if it was, these would easily be pulling out of my pants.Was very much looking forward to this problem going away, but alas, Icarus flew too close to the sun and his hopes were trounced.Happy hunting.

These are long enough to stay tucked in when my man bends over and long enough to cover my hiney when I steal one of his t-shirts to wear to bed!  Label says use non-chlorine bleach. One strange thing, I compared the price offered between the 6x ""Small (34-36 chest)"" and the 6x ""Small"" and noticed the ""Small"" ones were about half the price of the other listed size smalls.  I ordered the less expensive version which was just under fourteen dollars, and when the package came, it said ""Small (34-36"" chest)"" so I don't know why the sizes are listed two ways but buyer may want to look at pricing for both listed sizes and choose the one with the best price.

  My husband, who’s tall, really likes that these shirts don’t come untucked. He is very mobile at work with bending and lifting, and these long tee-shirts stay tucked in his cargo pants worn with a belt. He wears these tee-shirts under his button-down dress uniform shirts.  The fabric is of medium thickness—you can see light through the weave but not so much that they are flimsy/sheer.  The shirts work well as an extra layer under another shirt without being too hot as they are not heavy-duty, thick tee-shirts. I don’t think I would recommend wearing them as a single layer in public, though.

  Lost about 2.5 inches in length when wet.  Thats normal, but the shirts did too.Really, once through the wash twice they shrunk up good and now expose my belly when arms are raised.  Fruit of the loom support responded quickly to my concern, but but did so too quickly, by sending out six more t-shirts of the same size. Nice to see them so eager to try to rectify the problem but I would have preferred if they consulted me first, as I would have told them to send the next size up. I do expect the replacement shirts to shrink just as much as they are the same exact product.For the record I'm a lean 6' 2, and I got medium to avoid excess billowing at waist.  Fit great coming out of the package but definitely order a size up if you are concerned about length.

  very nice shirt. I've been buying Hanes large  undershirts, but they're rather short and I have to stretch them to tuck them in. These Fruit of the Loom shirts are much longer in the body for easy tucking.In addition, I prefer the texture of the Fruit of the Loom shirt (smooth, silky feeling cotton) vs. the Hanes shirt (rougher cotton texture).As you can see, I think the Fruit of the Loom shirt is better than the Hanes shirt. To top it off, they also cost less.

  These t-shirts are tight on me and uncomfortable. I'm 5' 5or6"" tall & 157#, and I usually buy cheap t-shirts, Large size, to wear both as an undershirt in the winter and as a single shirt in the summer.  I bought these large size t-shirts (twice) while sheltering-in-place because my current ones were getting holes in them and I needed some new ones for summer. I wouldn't buy these again. They are: much lighter in weight than my normal  t-shirts (which means they won't work as well as an undershirt in winter), the sleeves are shorter than normal (7""x3.5"" top of sleeve & under sleeve, in comparison to  8""x5"" for my previous ones), the armhole where the sleeve attaches is smaller, so the sleeves are then tight & binding under my arm and also makes the shirt stretch and pull under tension when I raise my arms, and tight around my biceps (not too much actual measured difference, but because of the shorter length of the under-portion of the sleeve combined with the too small arm hole, ends up making the sleeve somewhat tight around my not enormous biceps), and the neck is also somewhat binding. The arm hem seams are somewhat tiny, suggestive of general scrimping on material, and the whole shirt feels 'tight' and binding, not loose as I normally get. The shirt is uncomfortable to wear, & I regret buying them, but they'll have to suffice for now. I would not advise buying them, unless thin light weight & tight is what you're looking for. The only good things are they lack physical labels (which irritate the back of my neck), and they are long enough to not ride up out from my pants in activity (they fall halfway between mid-thigh length and belt height).

It ticked me off about the colors to immediately write this review. #Update next day - The shirts do not shrink when washed in cold water. They are soft against the skin and comfortable to wear. The lack of variety in color is my only complaint.

  Way too tight to actually  wear! If they didn't  need to ever be cleaned, they would be fine. They fit out of the package, but, even following the washing instructions, the amount of shrinkage was way in excess of what should occur. They became little boy t-shirts! Ugh! Total waste of money!

    Perfect T Shirt for tucking in.
  
",5.0,LB Hubert,"Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  These T Shirts are now one of my favorites.  They are great for tucking in your trousers because they're long enough to stay tucked in.  I purchased them to wear under long sleeve shirts but found that I like wearing them just as T Shirts alone as long as I want to have them tucked in.  In my opinion, they would be too long to wear outside of your trousers but that's not what I purchased them for.  So they work great for my use.  Fabric is just thick enough for all around use.

  For whatever reason most t-shirts are made for people with really small bodies and they tend to shrink vertically as they are washed.  These shirts are long enough to remain tucked in and it is hard to imagine them shrinking enough to cause un-tucking issues.  I threw my other shirts out and purchased more of these.

  These are great. I’m a bigger guy (6’ 270lbs) and used to buy XLT undershirts so they would stay tucked in. The problem with them was that the sleeve was always too long too.These are great though. They stay tucked in all day and don’t hang out of my over shirt.The one drawback is that they aren’t very soft so you definitely need some fabric softener for them.

They feel like I am wearing a sweater in the summer.5.  These shirts are itchy like wool.

It’s not worth sending back $15 in undershirts so chock it up to my last Fruit of the Loom.So compare these to toilet paper. These are the equivalent of the cheap single ply garbage you find at the airport. Nobody has time for one ply, and no one should for these shirts either.

  First off, I must admit I am totally surprised! We have not purchased ""Fruit of the Loom"" T-shirts since the 1960's! Back then they were very thin and never fit right after washing! Today's version is much better! The material is much thicker and the shirts fit quite comfortably. OK, the trick to ordering is to order a size bigger than you actually want! After reading other reviews and many were complaining of the shrinkage, I ordered XX-Large since my husband wears X-Large. When the shirts arrived, I panicked! They were gigantic! But after washing them and then drying them in an electric dryer, the XX-Large did shrink all the way down to a perfect X-Large! My husband loves the fit and the feel of the shirts. Warm and soft!

    Cheap garbage that loses all elasticity after one wash
  
",1.0,Mark,"Reviewed in the United States October 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  Fits as expected, if you wear one straight out of the bag, and throw it away after one use. I have had/used this brand and model shirt in the past, but they were store-bought.... lasted forever. The shirts I ordered from Amazon are terrible and cannot survive more than two washes (yes I know how to wash white shirts; yes I have a good washing machine). The shirts become loose at the collar and the waist, actually now that I think if it, they become loose all over.... the fabric also feels coarse. Surely this is a knock-off product. It’s garbage, do not buy.

  My husband wears them under T-shirts so he likes them a little tight. They did shrink a little bit when I wash them. You can't beat the price of these shirts. I would probably order them again knowing that they will probably only last a couple of months for how much my husband wears them. I can't tell a difference in the more expansive one and these.

    Warning - contains anti-microbial additive (embedded nanosilver particles)
  
",1.0,David Christopher,"Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2019","









  
  
    
  I was really excited about ordering these shirts after much research, only to be sorely disappointed when they arrived in the mail.My primary concern is their ""Dual Defense"" additives, specifically IntelliFresh, which refers to DuPont's SILVADUR embedded nanosilver particles. This is not mentioned *ANYWHERE* in Amazon's product description or photos, so I thought it was worth posting a review for others to be aware. I have included photos of the packaging so you can see what I mean.What's so bad about nanosilver? Isn't odor-fighting, moisture wicking technology a good thing?!I used to think so, but now don't anymore. I encourage you to do your own research, but the latest info says it is best to avoid antimicrobials completely because they provide no net benefit to humans and many of them are suspected endocrine-disruptors. Nanosilver is relatively new and not well-researched compared to traditional silver, but it can pass the blood-brain barrier and if ingested could interfere with your healthy gut bacteria.Additionally, silver is extremely toxic to marine life (second only to mercury), and when these particles wash out of your clothes in the laundry, they will eventually end up either in the ocean/rivers, or in wastewater treatment plant sludge, which is often land-applied as fertilizer. This could do massive harm to ecosystems.If you want to learn more, search online for the ""six classes of chemicals"" website and then go to the section on Antimicrobials. The Resources section at the bottom of the page has links to lots of useful info, including:--""Silver Nanotechnology and the Environment: Old Problems or New Challenges,"" Pew Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies report, 2008--""Some antibacterials come with worrisome silver lining."" Chicago Tribune, 2/16/2014--""Germ-resistant clothes: pick or pass?"" ABC News, 3/11/2012I have no affiliation with that website; a coworker shared it with me recently which triggered me to research more on my own.I returned the undershirts to Amazon immediately and did not open the package, so I can't speak to their fit or durability. I suspect they are great shirts except for the nanosilver additive, which makes this all the more disappointing.Fruit of the Loom, if you're reading this, please offer these exact same shirts but in plain old cotton (no additives)! I would happily pay for that.

  For - well forever - have used Hanes shirts.  Haven't been very happy with the last two reorders of those, so went with these this time.Fit is great. I love the extra length to help keep them tucked in, and so far it works.  Would love a tiny bit more length in the sleeve, but that's not a deal breaker.I feel like these are thinner than the Hanes that I've been used to, which wears fine - and better on warm days.  But I am thinking that this will negatively impact their lifespan.Fit's great! They do stay tucked in!

  The tee-shirts arrived on time, in good condition; they fit well and are comfortable. The weave is light: the tee-shirts are suitable for summer but would not keep a person warm in winter. They are opaque white and cannot be seen through.Each plastic package contained 6 folded tee-shirts. The tee-shirts are creased when they come out of the package. Removing the creases would require either washing or ironing the tee-shirts.

  I have yet to wash them so this review may change. BUT I am 6'3 athletic build and I bought mediums and these are BY FAR the best white undershirts I own. They fit my length and comfortable loose, sleeves fit well and don't look awkward and they were relatively inexpensive. Depending on how they shrink I will for sure be buying these again. I wear them everyday and they look great, little thinner material but not thin enough to see my nipples under my shirt (highly important) as I work out in these after work and rather not look silly...GREAT PRODUCT

  I ordered these t-shirts for my husband who wears them for work. Most nights, he works 16 hours and needs shirts that will stay tucked in. Upon opening the package, I thought ""oh good, nice long tails"". Once they were washed and dryed, they had shrunk at least six inches, maybe more. These shirts won't even fit my 11 year old grandson. Most reviews were glowing, so I gave them a try. I have to wonder if they were paid for their reviews. I wish I had not made this purchase, they were a waste of time and money. Fruit of the loom will be added to my do not buy list!

",1.0,Di,"Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2019","









  
  
    
  I was looking for new T-shirts, and I like the Fruit of the Loom ""Eversoft"" Fabric. As the name implies, they're soft and comfortable.So, I did a search on Amazon using only the word ""eversoft"", without specifying ""Fruit of the Loom"" or ""t-shirt"". These shirts are the first hit, and are shown as the Number One seller. I selected Large, and looked at the included photos, TWO of which show the packaging, and sure enough, the photos mention ""eversoft"".I ordered two packages, and (my luck being what it is), the packaging I received is different, and doesn't mention eversoft.Thankfully, Amazon has free returns on these shirts if unopened. So, back they went within 15 minutes. Fastest return I've ever done on Amazon.I've bought the same shirts as these locally, and for me, the new fabric is a waste of money. It's thin, and every time they are washed the sleeves roll up like there's a pack of Lucky Strikes in 'em. Same with the bottom seams.I hope this saves someone some time.

    Finally an undershirt that stays tucked!

  Finally, I have found a T-Shirt that stays tucked all day! Sure this is from the tall line - but they fit. I was tired of buying larger shirts to stay tucked in - having them bunch up around the chest or midsection. These fit great! I wish companies would just add an inch or two to the length of their undershirts - those should be designed for that purpose. When I need replacements - I will get these again.

  This T-shirt is perfect for my needs - fits great - not too tight, not too loose, long tail stays put.  It is lightweight and very comfortable.  I use it to sleep in and for under dress shirts and it is perfect for that purpose.  Can't speak to long term wear as I have only had it a short time.

  The information about this product is lacking both on the packaging and in the amazon description.  The shirt is 100% cotton and tagless.  I was unsure what stay tucked meant.  It means the shirt is extra long.  I bought a small for my tween son and it is skinny and 29 inches long from top of collar to bottom hem. it may work for people with long torsos but definitely a tuck in tee for anyone else.

    Fits long but tight esp. around shoulders, weird smell at first, number of each color inconsistent
  
",4.0,Nate C.,"Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had originally gotten a 5 pack of grey and black in size Medium. First of all, for reference, I'm tall and skinny but have pretty wide shoulders. The length is perfect for me - it's long enough to actually stay tucked in and the length didn't drastically shrink in the wash unlike most other undershirts I've worn. The width is narrow/tight which is great for me around the waist and chest since most other undershirts are a bit to wide, but the shoulders were uncomfortably tight. Even as someone who is used to dealing with shirts with narrower shoulders, it was surprisingly too tight and uncomfortable. So I ordered the same pack again but with a size Large this time. Now they are much more roomy and comfortable around the shoulders, although maybe a little too baggy/wide. And of course the length is hilariously long since the Mediums were already long enough, but since I always tuck them anyway in I don't mind. I'm still glad I switched to the Large and will probably keep wearing them since it's hard for me to find grey undershirts that are long enough to stay tucked in. So I would recommend ordering a size up if you can't stand really tight shoulders.Another thing to note is that all the shirts smelled pretty bad at first (again, I got the grey and black ones so I'm not sure if the other colors smell too). I'm guessing it's from Formaldehyde or something. I didn't always notice the smell right away for some reason, but it's definitely noticeable after the shirts are sitting there a while or you sniff closely. And none of my other clothes smell like that so I know it's not coming from anything else. However, after washing them several times in a row and adding a cup of white vinegar in the washer with them, the smell has pretty much gone away, so in the long run I don't think it's a big deal. Just be aware that you may have to wash them multiple times for the smell to fade away.One more issue is that the number of each color pictured in the pack is not necessarily what you will get. The black/grey 5 pack I ordered had 3 grey and 2 black shirts for my first order of size Medium, which is what was shown in the picture and is what I wanted. However, when I ordered the same pack but with a size Large, I got 2 grey and 3 black instead. It's not a huge deal to me and not worth returning given the cheap price, but I was slightly disappointed because I mainly just want the grey shirts. So keep in mind that the picture might not match exactly what you will get.

  These shirts work great the first time you wear them - the problem is after the first wash. These things wrinkle like nothing I've ever owned, and the hems all fold over themselves. You essentially have to iron them to get them to fit right, which to me defeats the purpose of an undershirt.

  I always try to find the best deal for white undershirts when I need them. I haven't had Fruit of the Loom in years. I've been using Gildan most recently. These shirts are a bit longer and will stay tucked much easier. However, they are quite a bit tighter around the shoulder / armpit area almost to the point of being uncomfortable. I'm only 5' 7"" ~130lbs so I wouldn't expect a size Medium to fit so tight in the arms / shoulder area. They seem to be slightly thinner than other shirts I've used in the past. But, for the sale price I paid, I can't really complain too much.

    Decent quality but these shrink 1-1.5 inches in every measurement after one wash
  
",3.0,,"Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2019","Casual undershirts/bum around/weekend t-shirts have always been an issue for me. I love my t-shirts to fit more on the snug side and I have mid-section that's more on the long side. Usually, I end up with shirts that either fit well out of the packaging and later, end up shrinking so much they end up too short. Or, I end up with shirts that stay long enough but even after shrinking, they end up loose fitting. It's a very frustrating struggle.

To combat the above, I usually end up trying to find t-shirts that are 95% cotton and 5 % spandex. However, very, very few companies make those and most are either poor quality or priced far too much for just a simply t-shirt.

Which brings me to these. I read several reviews, the product write up and basically took a flyer because they're fruit of the Loom. I'm not impressed with how much these shrink.

Measurements:

Size Large

Out of the package:

Pit to Pit: 22 inches
Top of collar to bottom front: 28 inches
Top of collar to bottom back: 31.5 inches

After washing once(cold wash, gentle cycle, dried on medium heat setting):

Pit to Pit: 21 inches
Top to bottom front: 26.25 inches
Top to bottom back: 29.5 inches

Even considering this is 100% cotton, that's absolutely absurd shrinkage after one wash and dry cycle. The pit to pit shrinkage is perfectly fine but to lose 1.5 inches of length both front and back is just ridiculous. Given because I bought these on the higher end of my sizing, the after shrinkage will still work for me for now, but if you're on the upper end of being a large, you're already going to have a poor fit.

In sum, if you're considering buying a large, I strongly urge you to only buy a large if you are on the lower end of the chart. Yes, when you get these and put them on the first time, they will be slightly long and slightly baggy. However, after one wash, if you're on the upper end of a large, the fit likely isn't going to be to your liking. If you're on the lower end of a large, the bagginess of your first wearing will be replaced by a form fit.

So, these are a very tepid recommendation from me ONLY if you are on the lower end of any given size and tend to not have an overly long mid-section. If you're on the upper end of a size and have a long mid-section, I would suggest moving up a size. You may think I'm crazy when you first wear them but after they shrink, you'll understand why I'm recommending the way I have!

  Some product review said these were soft t-shirts. I have found lots of others that are much softer, I would say they are a bit stiff. Also with a 46"" chest I ordered XL, but it still felt too snug on the fit. If you are looking for a soft undershirt this may not be the right one for you and the fit is a bit small.

  Hey folks!To get started, 6 shirts for the price paid is pretty dang good. I just got done washing and drying them and it fits excellent. I am 5'10"" (182cm) and 300lb (136kg). I normally wear a size 2XL but considering the brand and cotton shirts I had bought a 3XL. After a wash in ""cool"" water"" and a dry cycle on ""Low"" the shirt came out perfect. Nice, clean, and looks great, it isn't too tight, or too short. The stay tucked feature really held up to its name. 100% recommend this product.

  These shrink immediately after the first wash/dry. I ordered larges and they fit perfect when I first got them. I tossed them in the dryer on the lowest heat cycle my dryer offers (brand new dryer) they shrunk to smalls. They aren't long enough to stay tucked in and the arms are almost like a shoulder cover now. If you do get these order 1-2 sizes larger if you want to toss them in the dryer after a wash.They came in a pile like they were from a bulk order or something. none of them had tags or were folded just a stack of tshirts.

  I went a different route the last time I bought white tshirts and was sorely disappointed with the quality and length.  These shirts are long enough to go over your waistline, but not long enough to be overly problematic, and not short enough to always come untucked under your polo or dress shirt.Shirts are comfortable, not itchy, and perfect for the price.  I do tend to sweat a lot in my armpits, so after a while, the shirts will become discolored, but a 6 pack of these every 6-8 months at this price is just fine by me.
