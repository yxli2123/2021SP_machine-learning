  I'm gonna compare this(4g ram version)with the iPad 10.2.its not a fair fight but because the iPad was on sale ,its $50 more than this Lenovo m10 plus. and I got both on the same day.Don't use chrome browser on this tablet. it makes it very laggy especially if u are streaming hd videos.i use Microsoft edge and disable ad in the options and it loads way faster.the iPad was blowing this thing away when loading sites.now it's same speed n some sites it even load faster.Lenovo - smaller bezel , very easy to hold. lighter than the iPad.small battery ,lasted about 8 hours web browsing on half screen brightness.over all it runs pretty smooth but multi tasking can make the table Abit laggy.screen is clear but not as bright .ipad- same big bazels as 2010, feels big and heavy holding it.bigger battery .got little over 10 hours screen time web browsing with half brightness.the os is very smooth and handle multi tasking very well.screen is pretty much the same ,both are very clear but the iPad is brighter.over all this is a good tablet. it's an entry level tablet so don't expect too much.know what u need it for before u buy.im happy with it

  this is my fourth Lenovo tablet no I didn't buy a fourth one because the others broke I bought this one because it is the newest version of the Lenovo tablets and it does not disappoint. My first 3 Lenovo tablets were over 2 years old and they were dated but they still work fine but I sold them. They had the older Android or there so they could not update anymore. I had this tablet now for about 5 days and I have been using it every day it is beautiful very easy to work with very thin in very expandable with a SD card. I am adding a 256 gigabyte SD card to it so I can add more music to it. Plenty of room for all of your apps your Netflix Hulu plus HBO Max whatever you want to put on here you can add to it you like playing video games go for it you can download tons of games to it as well. This is a very easy tablet to carry around it is very thin so I would say get a carrying case for it throw it in your backpack and you are good to go.

  Bought it thinking sound quality would be better than the other tablet I have and it turned out, it was worse than my phone.  Shocked by that.  I had intended to use it in the office for streaming TV  and music.  Have a hard wired audio setup to go thru the headphone jack and the audio was horrible.  Then the thing locked up on me and I had to power cycle it to get it back.  Locked up again and then was returned.

  Used the tablet last weekend for my drone as my Pixel 2 phone would not pair with the drone. This didn't either at first but did eventually. The bigger screen is a plus for that purpose and if it gets dropped this is much cheaper than the phone. Noticed no notification last week but this week it did a system update so now 11/21/20 the tablet is on Android 10 (Syrup...Jawbreaker?). My defunct tablet is an old Toshiba Thrive and has a charging base that I wish this did as well, there are pins that are likely there for that reason. The screen looks very good and the system is smooth and responsive, at least it was with V9. I did pay for and get the plus model according to the box but the little drawer will not release with the supplied tool. I read that the WLAN model will not accept an SD Card so if this thing has its mouth glued shut I will get it open and find out Whisky Tango Foxtrot. Have to ding it a star for charging base not being available (it wasn't cheap for the Thrive) and for the SD card slot not opening. I seem to remember seeing somewhere that mine is the WLAN model but the box definitely says otherwise and so did the price. It is setup to be my dog's tablet so anyone can use it and read her MuttMail. (I hope she doesn't use it to order a truckload of bones) All in all I recommend this tablet and Sarah (the dog) gave it a pass after her customary smell test, hasn't tried to bury it in the yard nor has she shaken it like a screaming redheaded, bucktoothed baby and rip it apart like she did my friend's MAGA hat.Update 11/23/20Tried the DS Card tray release tool again but no matter the effort and prying it was futile. With the tool shoved all the way in it was time to get the knife out. It put up a good fight but even though it was as stubborn as the dunce woman living in my house my determination eventually won out and the jaw gave way. Put in anoew DS card, the tablet formatted it and all is well. Only had a 23 GB class 10 on hand but will up it to 128 when the need arises.

  I went with this tablet due to lower cost and good reviews and only needed it for small task. However as soon as I set it up it would make a weird scrambling noise thru the speaker. Almost seemed like it did it when something was downloading in the background or if I opened an app. The noise wouldn't interrupt while listening to music. Very annoying. The volume button on the side was a pain. The HOME graphic displayed on main screen was cut off at bottom of font. And it was very laggy even tho I didn't have much installed. Called tech support and he told me it was normal for it to make that noise and couldn't fix it 🤦 Since it was new and already dysfunctional, figured it probably wouldn't last. I returned it and purchased a Samsung Galaxy for a bit more $, but loving it much better! On a positive, it did have good screen quality and very vibrant.

  The one i received had display issues...the one i received had a dull screen in it's background white values...far from ""paper white"" which for me was caused contrast and text reading difficulties. Shame, because colors, pics, and vids are brilliant as I don't notice the grey against a strong color ok f display. I was not able to adjust any of the multiple settings to overcome the text issues. Further, bolding text and brightening in settings caused slightly bizzare effects and rapidly used battery much more than expected, although I can't qualify the latter battery issue with a bench test value.Otherwise, I was impressed by the pad and its build and qualities for this price point.  Ultimately, I had to return it....wondering if I got a sub optimal display or they are all shipped this way.  For about fifty dollars more I got the competitor's 10.1 tab which was an improvement over the Lenovo.

  This thing is awesome! Well worth the money. I'd say it's slightly faster than my iPad (I got the 8 core, 4GB RAM, and 64GB storage version of the M10 FHD Plus). The screen is amazing. There's no lag, and I've done some be pretty heavy workloads on it just to test it out. Large spreadsheets in Excel, large PowerPoints, no problem. I love the widescreen format for watching movies, and the audio with FLAC files is excellent. Highly recommend this. I would definitely but this again. I was going to buy one of the Fires, but the specs on this we're better and you get the full Play app store without having to sideload it (and even when you sideload the Play store on a Fire, some apps just aren't available or compatible).

  This is my 3rd Lenovo 10"" tablet. I replace them every 3 yrs or so when the battery life gets too short and the OS is outdated.  Wow! This is a huge upgrade from my last one.

  I bought two of these tablets. The picture quality is crisp and clear. It has a 1080p display but you can only watch Netflix in standard definition. It has to do with Netflix not Lenovo. This tablet has double tap to wake the screen like my LG phone. It also has a feature where if you pick up your tablet up it wakes up the screen. My case did wake the screen and turn the screen off when I closed or open the case but it doesn't anymore. It has a octa core processor and 2gb of ram. It can hold a micro SD card up to 256gb. It's running off android 9 (pie). There is a charging light that's red when charging and turns green when done charging. You can customize the home buttons and also the keyboard. You can have a different color keyboard or have a picture in it. You can also customize the height of the keyboard. Did I mention that this tablet has Dolby Atmos? It has two speakers and you can set the surround sound to movies, music etc. Which it optimizes the sound depending on movies, music or whatever you're doing on your tablet. It makes it sound better. This is the best tablet I ever had so far.

  Hardware is great.But Android is so stripped down it's frankly hard to use.  You have to get apps for almost everything.  Oh yes, it comes with some google apps and a few other things, but not much.  And then you have to sort thru the apps from the play store that have ads in them or have privacy concerns, or are ways to rip off your credit card.  Even most of the file browsers have ads in them!  I mean you would think that you would get a simple file browser in peace.  Yes, there is a google file browser preinstalled, but it's got its own privacy issue in that it came from Google which is mining most of what we do with AI for some time.  I just want a simple notebook that gives us our privacy back, and I don't feel like it's harvesting me in some way at every turn of the screw.  Next time I'm going to go looking for a true open source Linux machine, that runs something like Ubuntu.

This is my second tablet so I don't have a whole lot to compare it to-and I have no plans right now to buy a 300-$500 tablet, but it seems much nicer then my 7 Kindle which tend to have too much bloatware and uses up too much battery life. I thought this mostly to replace my it which seems to be probably on its last legs after 4yrs. (Ty amazon). The 10 inch screen I bought the $150 10.3 FHD version which fits my needs. so I can't really say a Samsung is better etc. . Had a little trouble getting the time on the clock just right.

",5.0,Jeremey Poparad,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2021","









  
  
    
  I primarily use my tablets for reading music and I purchased this to replace an Asus TF300T I'd been using for the past 8 years and was becoming unresponsively slow. I've been using two of these (one for backup) for a couple months now and I'm very happy with them! The screen goes all the way to the edge, so even though the 10.3"" screen is larger than the 10.1"" screen on my old Asus, it's actually a smaller tablet as there's no wasted border space. The screen is very bright and everything works great with the Mobilesheets app and my Airturn pedal. Battery life is pretty good, too. After a two hour rehearsal, I've usually used only about 30% of the battery.The only complaint that I have, which would be true for most tablets I looked at, is that the charging port is on the bottom, which doesn't work for having the tablet on a music stand while also charging it. Fortunately, I can rotate the screen 180° and lock it there, but then my tablet case opens backwards and sometimes it forgets the orientation when waking it from sleep so everything is upside down.Overall, this is a very gig-worthy music tablet!

  Struggles to run any sort of app that needs a decent amount of processing power (i.e games and surprisingly enough, file management).Effectively closes all other apps when they're not active. This means that if you tab out of your browser app, tabbing back into it will require you to log back into to websites, re-fill forms, etc. Extremely annoying and unnecessary.USB link with a computer is unresponsive at best, duplicates files at worst. Using it with a Windows 10 desktop, and tablet will always either hide it's internal storage, never show up, randomly disconnect itself after moving files around. Trying to mount an internal SD card makes these problems even more frequent, somehow.Absolutely awful ""derivative"" Android settings menu. This looks and feels like an Android OS, but everything is just not where you expect it to be, and some settings *just don't work* (i.e automatic brightness will decide when it will work, and when it'll just keep the brightness at full blast, actual time be dammed).Heinous permissions issues with common apps. Twilight screen dimmer only seems to work half the time as the system constantly denies permission to dim and color shift the screen. WinRAR is permanently blocked from having storage access, and can never delete files, only create and extract them. App Store installation will constantly complain about ""running out of space"" when updating apps, requiring full re-installs.Poor audio quality and static when using the 3MM headphone jack. Constant crackling and distortion if the base volume is set too low, or if the tablet is under performance stress.It's an $150 dollar tablet, I guess. You get what you pay for.

I had previously had Lenovos and I wanted to try this one because it is Android which allows for a few apps I need that you can't get with Kindle. I ordered this tablet with the case that is recommended. It came fairly quickly although they seems to be popular and a bit hard to get sometimes.So far I love this tablet. I will start by saying it is not super fast, so if you are looking for a high-powered device, this may not be the best choice. I have found it to be lightweight, solid and very usable. It was super easy to set up and it works well. I can easily read documents. It's easy to carry around too so I just take it with me when I do go into work. I have also discovered that it works really nice for streaming video. My new cable is set up to stream TV. I have been just using the tablet to stream things. It gives a great picture and seems to be pretty glitch free.If you are looking for a basic tablet that is big enough to read documents and you are just a basic user, it's hard to go wrong with this tablet.

I did look at the Vankyo models and found the Lenovo to have more ram, storage, and higher resolution. I also like the Lenovo brand, though everything is made in China. I wish Lenovo would make a 14"" or larger tablet at this price point. 10.3"" is nice, but peloton has shown that there is a market for large panels attached to fitness equipment.

CPU performance is little bit faster than Fire HD 10 (2019)  and 4GB ram.  However it is also much expensive than it.

  This is a very nice tablet for the money. I am a diehard Apple products fan but I needed an inexpensive tablet just for using for meetings on ZOOM and this Lenovo Tab M10 Plus 4 Gigs Ram 64 Gigs storage seems to fit the bill. It has a nice size screen and great picture quality, It's fast and responsive not overly sensitive. The only setback is the fact that you cannot expand the storage capacity at all. The description of the tablet is a bit misleading suggesting that you can expand capacity. For what I use this tablet for, I think it's a very good tablet for the price and I would recommend it to others but just beware of the misleading information about being able to expand the storage.

  The screen won’t display most video apps since it is not fully certified to protect content. Called Lenovo and they blamed google or tried to charge $200 for software support. Can play standard def netflix. Can’t play vudu. Can’t play Hulu. Can’t play Disney+. Can’t play CBS all access. Can play most content on Facebook but will dial it down to SD. I watched a video I shot on my phone that looked great in every other device after posting to Facebook, but on this device it stretches the video to hd after downgrading to standard definition, the result is garbage video. Lenovo, paying for your content protection certs will make you product tolerable for budget consumers.

    Experiencing some lag
  
",3.0,Pete S,"Reviewed in the United States May 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  When I  bought this tablet, I expected performance on the order of other tablets on the market, or phones, running Android.  I am disappointed to say that this device is extremely laggy.  For example, I stream a lot of content over the YouTube app.  Minimizing/maximizing the video seems to take 3 or 4 seconds for the system to process swipes to do so (something that is instantaneous on my phone, which has considerably less processing power than this tablet).  I get the impression that this device is very new to the market and I am hoping that there will be some type of update to address these issues, because, aside from the lag inherent to using some key apps, this is a great tablet.

  The M10 Plus with 2 GB memory from Lenovo is a reasonably priced tablet for browsing and e-mail. It has a vivid display and medium battery life. It's not a good choice for apps or for gaming. We got one the second week in January, 2021, when Amazon sold them for about $130 and did not offer models with more storage. A week later we saw the Amazon price was about $150, and the models with more storage were available.. A ProCase cover is worthwhile option to reduce wear and damage. Amazon described the battery rating as about 7 amp-hours, but Lenovo specs clearly say about 5 amp-hours. In any event, we get about 8 hours of Web browsing.

I've done a bit of research on this and it honestly seems like an issue between Lenovo and Netflix so there is some hope of it eventually getting fixed but given the response from Lenovo on their forums (essentially none) it may be a while.

If you let them die or run out of battery they won’t turn back on. You’ll have open it up and do some taking apart to get it to turn back on which is a lot of work I did not sign up for. I paid $160 something for this tablet. I shouldn’t have to take it apart to get it to work. I’m returning this. Thank God it’s only been 3 days so Amazon let’s me return it.

  I'm now calling it the budget ipad or budget samsung tablet. It's fast processor and 4gb of ram (64gb storage memory) truly give it a fluid experience. Many tablets are solid but have 2gb ram which just doesn't cut it for multitasking. The screen quality is surprisingly sharp and HQ even impressing me for a $200 beast.I actually bought it as a gift for my father. I noticed him and my mom spent a lot of time sharing a $1,000 ipad(2 years ago). It's fast still. But my dad is truly impressed and glad I got him this bday gift. He's familiar with Android (his phones samsung s20) and thinks it's very comparable in speed. He now prefers it to the ipad. That's impressive. $200 preferred to a thousand dollar ipad.Now obviously ipad or samsung is a tad better, faster, clearer. But the difference to me (and my dad) don't think the $400+ difference in a good samsung tablet or ipad just isn't worth it. It of the cheaper but solid tablets this beasts the vankyo matrix and is number 1.Highly recommended for those wanting a tablet with speed and function in FHD display with 4gb ram and Lenovo a great brand it is the beast of all budget tablets. Solid battery life too.5/5

  DO NOT ALLOW TABLET TO UPGRADE TO ANDROID 10!Lenovo has pushed out the system upgrade over the past few weeks and it BREAKS parts of the OS. Widgets stop working, notices don't show up, screen does not power off when case closed. This update is still is de-facto beta and will stop functions from working!After two weeks of use I can say with certainty that this is a nice little tablet. Running android nine means that it has a very clean and non-crapware installation.The colors are sharp and bright and the ship seems rather peppy. There’s no discernible lag in loading or switching applications.On the downside it is possible for a tablet to be too thin and sensitive. The finish is also extremely smooth. This combination of factors makes the tablet both difficult to hold and difficult to hold onto! To solve this issue I went with the ORANXIN Case for Lenovo M10 Plus - Silicone Soft Skin TPU Shockproof Lightweight Protective Cover for Lenovo M10 Plus TB-X606F/X 10.3 inch Tablet. And my only complaint about it is that I wish it fit slightly tighter.The other issue that stands out is that despite the tablet having a 1920 x 1200 resolution the Netflix app only allows you to look at standard mode. Also if you trying to stream a 1080p movie from your home media server you are going to want to pre-transcode the file for smooth playback. I don’t know if the issue is with the hardware or with the network connection.All in all this tablet gets five stars.

  Pros:-Very crispy display and resolution-Material is beyond this price point-Premium packaging-Great for light browsing-Expandable storage-Nice screen size-Very adaptable-PriceCons:-Not great for games (lags a lot for simple games like roblox)-Webpages and videos take long to load (Approximately 5 seconds)-Slow even with 4GB ram and octacore-Volume levels are quite low-Mediocre sound quality-Low battery lifeIn the end, this tablet is great for movie watching with external speakers. It works well for productivity purposes. Using this for reading will work very nice with almost no bezels. Web browsing could get bothersome with the slow loading times. Gaming however is almost impossible with the lag even though this brags octacore and 4GB ram. Overall, this is an amazing tablet for the price. Almost a steal but has its downsides.

  This is my 5th Lenovo tablet 10"" over the years and I have been fairly happy with them up until now.  The tablet is fine and all but the battery is the worst. My son plays games and watches YouTube all the time on this and we get about 4 hours of battery life which is terrible.  My last Lenovo 10"" got a good eight hours under heavy use.  If I could return it I would.  The battery is way too small for a tablet.

  I wasn't expecting miracles for what I paid, but I was expecting it to be at least as good as my 2-year-old phone.It looks really nice, but it is really slow. It's mostly fast, but it freezes up for half a second on a regular basis, usually when I touch the screen.The battery life is embarrassing. I pretty much have to leave it plugged in when I'm.nit using it, and I'm only using it as an ebook reader now.It also came with a scratch on the screen (under the protective packaging, so it left the factory that way!)I'm using it as an ebook reader, because it's not really useable for much else.

  UPDATE: After 2 system updates to/for Android 10 this tablet is almost useless. No apps will run in the background so no notifications. Startup is now long waiting for Omcap to load, once it does the widget's and notifications stop working. I will never buy another Lenovo protuct after this experience.I love this thing. Coming from a tab8 this is huge (screen, storage and ram) games play well not perfect. Wifi is strong. Movies look great. 2 negatives, the speakers are not loud enough to use as a wake up alarm(I can't see it being able to wake even a light sleeper). And the auto brightness just kinda freaks out, go super bright for no reason in a dark room or stay super dark outside in sunlight.

  Been using this tablet for about a week now. Battery lasts me all day unless, I am playing multiple games.

",4.0,A Guy,"Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2021","









  
  
    
  Good value. The screen is superb, right up there with the best. The speakers, though, are pretty poor. Stereo separation is great, but otherwise they don't even sound as good as the single speaker on my Motorola smart phone (Z4). A far cry from a Surface pro, and leagues behind iPad speakers. They're loud enough, but generally unpleasant to listen to, which is a bit of a bummer because part of the use I was planning for this was watching movies around the house.Performance is adequate. In daily use, it's perfectly snappy. Battery life is fair, but not exceptional. Build quality and materials surprised me. It feels higher end than its price would suggest. If you're buying this for a kid, though, you should still find a robust case. I'd recommend that for any tablet. Lastly, ergonomics are reasonable but not excellent. It's very thin and, without a case, slippery. An iPad feels considerably more ergonomic/manageable, probably due to a friendlier aspect ratio.Overall, it's a very nice tablet for the price and I recommend it. It's also worth mentioning that Lenovo and Motorola traditionally give you a very clean android experience with minimal bloat (unlike Samsung.. ugh). Don't underestimate how great that is!

  4 meg RAM, 64GB storage, perhaps will get Android 10.  At this price it's great.  I use it mostly for reading, web browsing, and as a terminal for MoodeAudio.  This is a tablet, which means it is not a general purpose computing device.  Using a tablet for ""productivity"" or ""content creation"" is like trying to be a cabinet maker using only a hammer and chisel.  This is good at what it's really designed to do.  If you have a good wifi signal you can stream video or play it from a network source easily.  The 1080p display is decent, not as good as its predecessor's 2K display but considering the current price of Android 2K displays it's a very good compromise.  Sadly, it looks like most vendors aren't making good Android tablets any more.  The ASUS tablet I replaced (broke the screen) cost more, had a 2K display, aptX Bluetooth, and cost half again as much as this one.  This has twice the RAM and twice the storage.If you want a relatively inexpensive tablet with a decent display, bluetooth 5 (no aptX), a more than minimal amount of RAM, this is definitely one to consider.  Its aspect ratio makes it narrower than some tablets with the same diagonal measurement.  It's easier for me to pick up with one hand.  Its predecessor was just at the edge of possibility.  All in all I'm pleased.  I got more than I wanted for what I spent.  An ipad would be better, but not 3 times better by a long stretch.

  Very disappointing - especially after the super performance from my Lenovo laptop.The screen display is sometimes erratic - Usually, when I swipe to wake the unit, the password keypad appears in two phases. The 'sleep' feature works in 1 min on some applications and not at all on others - but again, not consistently with any of them.The performance overall is very inconsistent - If this is what it is, buy a different tablet.

    Man I really Love This Tablet!

  I have had a windows 10 tablet and I like android as I have an android phone. I used to buy laptops a long time ago from the company now known as Lenovo but was once IBM. The computers never broke on you. Now back to the tablet. The screen is far better than any tablet I have seen. And I am a computer tech. Second the speed is good. Third the battery last for about 3 days full charge depending on use. Now I don't play games so I don't know how long that would last on a charge. But surfing and emails and playing HD videos it last a long time. I love this tablet. My wife has a Galaxy Tab 10A and it blows her tablet out of the water. From pictures to video to the screen resolution and speed it's not even close. I see now I have to buy her one because she was not happy when she seen that LOL! Any way one thing that can be done is customizations where you can do more with the tablet. It's simple and not much to change on the tablet. But besides that man this tablet is so smooth and clear my goodness. Makes looking at videos better than looking at TV and I have 4k video. But the clarity of that screen is amazing and smooth. Downloading apps from google was a breeze. I had one issue with one app and that was Experian but I just went on the browser and done it that way. I also like that google has Microsoft Edge new browser that thing takes google chrome and make it look stupid !! I never thought I would like another windows browser ever because of chrome but I lied. Google better step up because Microsoft Edge is a beast!! With that as my browser it feels like a windows computer but yet it's android. Man I am loving this tablet. You can't go wrong people. I haven't found anything to say I hate this for what I use it for. The cameras are good. I haven't taken pictures with them yet but far as how it looks and the video looks when using the camera it's great! I don't use a tablet for those things but far as I can see pictures will be very nice on that tablet that is a bonus. And you can video stream far as zoom and any other camera streaming app. It's clear and works well. If you want a tablet this one is the real deal. As far as tablets I call this the #1 Killer to all tablets out there. Benchmarks I don't get into if you looking for that  it ranks pretty decent. But I don't get into that because I don't use that to it's full potential for what I need it for. Gamers can use this but I am not a gamer. But playing games work on this tablet and works well and flawless. I have the 4gb and 64gb model. And for $199 man that's stealing !!! Well enjoy people if you buy this tablet you will love it.

  Battery life may be below what some users expect, but that's because the processor is more than capable of performing multiple tasks and will be able to keep up with future platform updates. Speed comes at a price.Also, IF YOU ARE GOING TO BE USING MICROSOFT OFFICE, make sure you change the default browser to Chrome or Samsung from from Edge, before launching for the first time. If Edge is your default browser, the Office activation will hang. I have read several ppl having the same issue, but haven't seen the solution written anywhere.

  I just received my tablet yesterday and setting it up was a breeze. It came three (3) days earlier than originally scheduled. I have had a number of tablets and have been with android from the beginning. I own a Samsung S8 plus and a Samsung A50. I still have a Samsung Tab S 8.4 from when they first came out 5 years ago and it is still going. I usually keep my techs for a while and finally decided it was time to get a new tablet. Having used Android Pie on both phones, the Tab S had become woefully outdated and it hurt me to retire it. I began looking for a new tablet. As most know, the Tab S was a top of the line tablet and very pricey. The new S model can cost around $700. After exploring my options, I decided that this tablet might suit my purposes for a lot less and I was not disappointed. The screen is beautiful, the OS is smooth as silk, and I could not be happier. I have owned several Lenovo laptops and they also did not disappoint. I generally use my tab for surfing the internet, Youtube, checking my emails, etc. I do not game at all. For the casual user, I would highly recommend this tablet. For the price this is a steal.

  Sprung for the 64/4 gig instead of the 32/2.  Probably overkill for my needs, but not too much of a price difference when I was looking at them.  Nothing comparable in the same price range.Pros: Great screen.  Fast processor.  Plenty of memory.  Sound is pretty good (2 speakers).  Starts up in <30 seconds from being totally off.  Start up with facial recognition in just a couple of seconds.  Mutliple apps running at the same time didn't cause any hesitation or lag.Meh: Battery 5k mah.  Lenova, why not put in a 7k mah????  That said, I've cycled down to 30% or so and fully charged about 5 or 6 times now.  It'll run about 12 hours down to 30%, but I'm just surfing and playing simple games.  If you're using for video or playing games that use a lot of processing, you might want to proceed with caution.Cons: Love the idea of narrow bezels, but between that and the slim design and relatively slick back and weight, I had to get a case for it.  I don't normally use a case, but I had to for this one, and it made a world of difference.

  Very impressed with this tablet so far. The battery life is impressive, even when doing something demanding like gaming (although not the most graphically intensive mobile games out there). The screen is sharp and responsive, the speakers are great, and the system comes with minimal bloatware or other such annoyances. Only complaint is the processor--as others have mentioned, it is lagging a bit behind in the mobile device market these days. Still, perfectly fast enough for the vast majority of tasks and leads me to conclude this is a great buy despite that one weak area.

  UPDATE: The tablet did upgrade to Android 10 and is actually performing a little better than before in games.I've been looking to replace an aging laptop for some time now, and a tablet seemed like a better fit since I mostly used it for media. I had several requests:1. 128 GB of storage with micro SD expansion slot2.  4 GB of RAM3. 10 inch screen4. Headphone jack5. USB type C connector6. No more than $3007. Name brand8. Android 10This tablet fulfills all but the last request, it runs Android 9 out of the box, but from my understanding, it's likely to get an update to Android 10 at some point. I'm not sure why such a recent tablet doesn't ship with the latest version of the OS, but this is hardly an issue unique to this tablet.So what do I think? Well, I'm mostly impressed. Let's start with the good. As I stated in the title, this is a great bang for the buck in terms of specs. You'll see a lot of brand new tablets that are 2 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage. Granted, they're in the $150 price range, but those are pretty bottom of the barrel specs, even for a mobile device. Even the standard iPad only has 3 GB of RAM and 32 GB of storage and it costs $330.The screen is a highlight, the color and brightness are impressive. The resolution is 1920x1200, so it's slightly better than 1080p. Videos and games really pop. It's not going to compete with OLED, but it's one of the best parts of the tablet.In the audio department, it's pretty standard fare, the speakers don't sound fantastic, but they are well placed on either end of the tablet so it sounds more organic. I'm pleased to report that there is a headphone jack for those who are so inclined (an increasingly rare feature in phones and tablets) as well as support for Bluetooth 5.0.As far as performance is concerned, it's good. The 4 GB of RAM means programs can run in the background and not bog the tablet down, which makes it a great device for multimedia. The menus and apps felt responsive, not buttery smooth, but I didn't encounter any performance issues for media/apps. It doesn't fare as well in the gaming department, but it ran everything I threw at it. My only gripe is Call of Duty Mobile stuck the graphics on the low setting.In terms of build quality, it's quite impressive. The materials feel premium with good haptics, the body is metal and it seems like it would hold up even if dropped.Now for the the negatives, I found the cameras to be sub par. There's a 8 MP rear camera and a 5 MP front camera, the overall image is soft. Those are far from impressive in 2020. The video camera is similarly fuzzy as it only supports 720p and 1080p, there's not even a 60 FPS mode. More light does yield better results, just keep your expectations in check.While I am glad the tablet uses USB C (which should be the universal standard across the board) however, it does not support fast charging. This means you while charge the device while using it, it won't be able to keep pace. While it will gain a charge with the screen off, it's painfully slow  You have to turn the tablet completely off to give it a proper charge.I have other smaller gripes such as Netflix only running in 480p (which, from my understanding, is an issue between Lenovo and Netflix), the Lenovo overlay (which can be mostly negated), and the less than perfect battery life, but these are getting into nitpicks at this point. Overall, I am very satisfied with the tablet, there are some cut corners, that is somewhat to be expected at this price point. I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a mid-range tablet at a great price.

    Beautiful Screen, Does Not Have a Qualcomm Processor
  
",4.0,,"Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was on my third replacement Fire 10"" tablet and the same issue started happening again. I wanted no part of a 4th replacement so I decided to get this Lenovo M10 Plus. It was a recent release, had good specs and the price was comparable with the latest Fire 10"" (that I had NO intention of even considering). One big selling point was in the Amazon description which stated ""Throw in seamless Qualcomm Snapdragon octa-core processing. . ."" Imagine my surprise on getting the tablet running CPU-Z and discovering it does not have a Qualcomm processor. CPU-Z reports a Cortex A-53, Lenovo's website says (as does the system information) that it has a Media Tek Helio P22T. This didn't make me happy. Trying to contact Lenovo made me even less happy.But. . . I needed a tablet, I have a tablet, I'm going to keep it. Simple as that.It does have a really sharp and clear screen. Color reproduction matches my laptop pretty well. I like the side firing stereo speakers. The remind me of my old Samsung 10"" tablet that had speakers in the bezel that were aimed at your face. These are a close second. The Dolby Atmos controls take a while to tweak but sound reproduction is above average. I'm a little disappointed at how restrictive Lenovo is with Android 9. My settings menu, even with developer options turned on, I look like a strict business product that the corporation doesn't want the employees messing around in.Performance is ok, this isn't a gaming rig and it shows. I tried Castle Wreck which I play on my Galaxy S9 phone and it ran, horribly, but it didn't crash. But again, I needed a tablet because I'm disabled and spend a lot of time flat on my back. I watch videos from several sources, surf the web and my casual games, cribbage, backgammon, etc. run fine.I had to get a case for it. The tablet screen is slightly bigger 10.3"" vs my old Fire's 10.1"" but the tablet itself is significantly smaller than the Fire. It's thinner, lighter and the bezels are almost non-existent. That, plus the incredibly slick aluminum back made holding the tablet while laying down difficult to say the least. Found an affordable 3rd party cover that does what I needed.All in all? The screen is stunning. It runs everything I need it to though not all I wish it would. Price was right and it had a full year warranty. It'll do.

  I was disappointed to see that it doesn't support sim. The CPU/RAM is awesome. Screen is dim in comparison with apple products. Storage can be expanded which is awesome feature for the time when you have no network connectivity. No good option available for cover in market for this model.

",2.0,Brian C. Wachur,"Reviewed in the United States August 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  I ordered the Lenovo Tab M10 FHD Plus (2020). The tablet looks and feels great and I thought I got a really good deal -- it's much less expensive than an iPad or other tablets.However, this tablet is NOT GOOD FOR STREAMING VIDEO. Specifically the YouTube TV app -- the app would load and sound would play, but no video. After some research, I found that this was a common problem with this tablet across different streaming apps. For me, that was a dealbreaker.For the record, all of my software was up to date, wi-fi signal was good and I tried all of the usual restart, reinstall etc. tactics. I suspect it is a software issue on Lenovo's end.If you don't plan to stream video, this tablet seems great. However, if you are like most people and want to stream video ... look elsewhere or at least check to see if Lenovo has fixed the issue.

  The Lenovo tablets I've had (4 over the years) work well, have a small amount of bloat, and have a GPS that does not require WiFi to work. Unfortunately they do not have a compass. This one seems the same.The M10 FHD Plus is no different. if your app requires a compass, like some astronomy apps, then you may want to look elsewhere.According to Lenovo's site the M10, and M8, will be updated to Android 10 this year; it already has 9 (Pie).One star was removed because of Lenovo's service. I bought an M8 on Lenovo's site a few months ago and am still waiting for reimbursement on a price match. Two days after my order their price dropped $20 so I contacted Lenovo to get a price match (30 day guarantee on their site). After countless e-mails and calls I'm still waiting on the reimbursement. fwiw - Since ordering I saw their M8 tablet go through several different promos on their site (e.g. $139, $129, $119) up, down, and up again within days/a week of each other.Last month, October, I bought the M10 FHD Plus on sale from Amazon and received it in record time.Bottom line - unless you need a compass the M10 FHD Plus tablet works great. I would not rely on Lenovo customer service, maybe their tech support is better.Stay safe & Cheers!

  The screen quality is good, if not extraordinary, but the responsiveness is all over the place. Some of the UI choices are also poor. For example if you hold your tablet at the upper left, you will constantly get the items in the ""swipe down"" menu showing up, even if you swipe. The swipe up, on the other end, is not responsive enough and doesn't fully close an app. You have to go and swipe it a second time. Kindle does not work very well on this tablet, particularly you may end up turning pages when you do not want to, depending on how you hold it.Make sure to check what Google is gathering from you (hint: it's *a lot*) unless you go and turn it off.All in all, this is not a terrible tablet, given it's price point, but it's not a very good one either.

Very few covers available just yet but we did find one that encases the tab rather than snaps in. Per usual, it takes time to set up w/the built in features, installing our apps & auto log ins. It is the best tab & we've had many over the years. We have a blue tooth speaker, large TV sound bar & ear buds connected for music, lectures, ebooks, movies, etc. It is great! We use it for work on Microsoft products, all the streaming services, email, photography editing, recipes in the kitchen, in the sewing room, on the patio, e-reading, research, etc..

  Es una lástima que Amazon venda una tablet que no tenga acceso a Wapp en nuestros días.

En mi país se consigue  tecnología más  actualizada  que la que tiene esta tablet y a precios similares. Realmente estoy arrepentido de haber comprado esta tablet que no puedo devolver porque el costo del flete desde mi país es muy alto y perdería aún más de lo que ya perdí.

This tablet only costs $50 more than the E10 and was the same price as the M10 (from MicroCenter) and it's definitely better than both. It's faster, smoother, and has overall a better user experience cause of it.I personally use it at my restaurant to automate lights, play music, etc. but it would also work great as a casual use tablet as well. The Plus comes with the higher def screen and the octa-core processor which makes it better for casual use. Bang for Buck, this tablet is 10/10.

  I HATE THIS TABLET!!! I guess Lenovo is doing what is next in the technology world but this tablet is AWFUL. Specifically when I'm in an app there is no back tab anymore. You are supposed to slide back. Well that doesn't work. It depends on the app. So instead of going back a single page to where I originated it backs me out to the table of contents. If the app has a built in button on a given page only then does the tablet take you back to where you were originally. The screen looks good. I bought a ""glass screen protector"" maybe that is what makes the response time a little slow. Once while using the device it went to the home screen but supposedly the home screen, because nothing was on the screen. Not the time, not the apps, nothing. It was unresponsive and literally DEAD!  I had to restart the tablet. I was supposed to call Lenovo but what good was that After the fact? The battery life is fair if you don't use the tablet. Meaning if you use it and don't use many apps you might get 8 hours out of it. The sound is cheap not quality at all clear but no depth. I had the Lenovo 10 inch with the micro or mini HDMI that tablet lasted and was a solid device. This is garbage and I HATE that I wasted my money. I thought getting used to it would help me with functionality, but familiarity doesn't make the device smart. I still get backed out of apps back to the table of contents. I hate that I simply can not go back. Sad because I really liked LENOVO but I will never purchase their products again. I hate all the sliding why doesn't this thing allow you to simply close the app. You end up with a row of apps draining battery because the device doesn't allow you to simply close the app

I understand I could put a sim card in it from my carrier and also use it as a phone, but I don't want to  I will put an SD card in it for more storage. So far it's just like having a larger version of my smartphone. I'll see if linking it to my laptop with windows 10 would work. I really wanted a tablet just to replace my aging HP laptop.

Along with this tablet I bought a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 10.1 with the same technical specs, I bought the Samsung because I had a coupon from American Express which saved me 50 dollars on the Samsung purchase and I bought the Lenovo because I had some ThankYou points that I could use on Amazon. Basically the ""only difference"" between the Samsung and this Lenovo, is the brand. I put 3 stars on the Lenovo because it is much slower, it freezes while running google meet and the Samsung doesnt do that even do they are practically the same in terms of technical specs. The Samsung runs very smooth and the camera quality is much better (pictures look nicer)

  Garbage. Won’t turn on even after letting it charge and following all the instructions. So I searched online for problems with a black screen and device will not turn it on for this particular model and it seems that there are a lot of users who have complained that even after fully charged and a reset, the device never turns on. Well, that is exactly my experience. I purchased this charged it went to turn it on and have never gotten past a fully black screen even after following all of the instructions on the Lenovo website for troubleshooting. I’m used to devices being able to work like Apple products right out of the box. So this is going back to Amazon for a refund and I’m going back to Apple for a device that actually does what it says.

    A solid budget option, but others to possibly consider in late 2020.
  
",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2020","My usage: Mostly passive consumption and background use during work - YouTube (podcasts, music, some movies for background noise), Audible, Prime Video. Some active tasks during downtime - Kindle, web browsing, N64 and DC emu gaming.

What I like:
•Solid and quality metal build.
•4gb memory/64gb storage
•relatively stock/vanilla android experience (not heavily forked)
•It will receive Android 10 ~Oct 2020.
•Nice screen resolution spec and IPS panel

What's Okay:
•Dual Speakers: Not terrible but nothing spectacular. Good enough for my needs as a lot of the time I used airpods or over the ear bluetooth headphones. What's expected for the budget price.

What could have improved:
• (Nitpick) The power button placed above the volume rocker would have been more intuitive for me. I kept putting the device to sleep instead of turning the volume down. I still hesitate for a second to check what I'm pressing.
• Battery life. I didn't travel that much this year so it wasn't a deal breaker, but 5,000mAh battery is something you'll have to remember about regular charges. I believe the stand by time would also last less than 3 days if I forgot about the tablet, it would definitely be dead.
•GPU: The Power VR 8320 is from 2014 which is pretty dated in tech terms. It doesn't benchmark well so if gaming is something you're into, you might want to consider another option.
•(Nitpick) The option for a persistent ""Recent"" task tray icon instead of a swipe up gesture - on stock android, you can enable this, however, Lenovo removed this option.
•Netflix, Prime Video, and some other steaming apps, won't render full HD resolution because of WideVine DRM. This might be a huge deal breaker for some people who want to use it for streaming video.

Overall: I got this in May and was pleased with the $200 price point and the build. It's a nice little work companion as I don't use a ton of apps, maybe a dozen total. I think if you're not into gaming it will do just fine for you but you might want to consider the Samsung A7 (2020).

Pros for Samsung:
•Battery: 7,040mAh vs 5,000mAh
•GPU: Adreno 610 (2019) vs PowerVR GE8320 (2014) - significantly higher benchmarks
•Quad Speakers vs. Dual Speakers - more powerful, slightly warmer and filling.
•Full HD for streaming apps (Netflix, Prime Video, etc)
•Possibly more future support/updates/xda development

I recently got the A7 on sale for $169.95 from Amazon (reg $229 - if it goes back up, wait for a black Friday or holiday deal) for the 3gb ram/32gb storage - though it does have less ram and storage I think a few things make it a possible better option. I haven't noticed any lag difference with 3gb ram for app tasks yet. 've got a regular habit of clearing the app tray unconsciously since the recent app button is there at all times. The 32gb will be supplemented with a microSD card, so storage isn't too much of a worry for my needs. Additionally I usually don't keep any apps around that I don't use. Though the screen size is nearly identical, I don't feel any significant downgrade from the IPS to a TFT, plus, you will get back full HD resolution on video streaming apps, so a TFT @1080p still beats IPS @720p or lower in my eyes.

Where I did notice a difference in performance was gaming. The Samsung's Adreno 610 GPU is noticeably faster and smoother than the M10's PowerVR GE8320 as to be expected from a near 5 year difference in age. I noticed this especially in several retro N64 emu games, so I'm glad I did get to test and compare. More than likely, I'll be selling the M10 Plus so somebody else can get use out of it as I don't need two tablets.

I was never a huge fan of Samsung's UI from the TouchWiz days as I much prefer a stock Android feel, however, their recent ""One UI"" interface doesn't feel clunky. I am using Nova Launcher just so I can give it more of a vanilla android feel with the icons and home screen features.",Configuration: M10+ 4GB/64GB

    Battery Life and MicroSD card slot/tray 'issue' deem 4 stars overall
  
",4.0,T. Taylor,"Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  I use the Lenovo Tab M10 Plus FHD mostly for browsing, emails and some gaming. I bought it specifically because of the 4 GB of RAM and added a 128 GB micro SD, and that's where you will run into an issue with the Lenovo Tab M10 Plus FHD  MicroSD card slot/tray. I had to return the first one as the tray would not eject. When my second one arrived, thank you Amazon, I realized that the key does not cause the tray to eject, as it describes in the instructions, but you have to use the key to pry, very carefully and patiently the SD card slot/ tray loose. This is not easy and it is the main reason I returned the first one as I did not figure out what the issue was until the second one arrived. It is not easy to ""very carefully"" remove the MicroSD card slot/tray. So if you need the added external memory, this will be an issue for you. And the battery life is so-so or average with the quality overall being pretty high these two issues cause me to rate the tablet 4 stars.

    Love this tablet, and it's not even 2 months
  
",4.0,R1,"Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2020","For the price, this thing is amazing!
I'm coming from a 2 year old Samsung that was about the same price when new.
This Lenovo is very fast, and can run several apps at once without serious performance degradation.
The ""Productivity mode"" is great, and uses a few of the better concepts of MS Windows or Mac OS.
The display actually occupies the entire front of the unit, unlike most mid-priced Android tablets, which have this huge wasted space in a bezel around the edge.

The two major drawbacks are audio and expansion.
Audio:
This tablet sounds *awesome*.
The problem is that max volume is way too low. Even connecting to an external BT speaker, it's barely loud enough to overcome my bathroom exhaust fan and shower water. My phone can do that without a speaker...

Expansion:
I have a USB-C dock with ethernet, HDMI output, USB ports, and SD card readers. This tablet refuses to recognize anything except the charging power pass-through. My USB-C phone recognizes everything on the dock with no problem, in fact, I needed to email dashcam video from the side of the road last week, and would have much rather used the big tablet display to do so, but instead had to use the itty bitty phone display because the phone works with the dock.
The tablet DOES work with Windows when plugged into a PC with a USB cable. Mass storage mode, for file management.
If they can release firmware that supports a dock or USB expansion (for mouse/keyboard/ethernet/SD reader, etc), I'll knock this thing up to 5 stars and overlook the audio annoyance.

One minor drawback:
""Tap to wake"" doesn't work after after a few seconds. If the display shuts off, I can double-tap it within a few seconds and it wakes back up. Any longer than that, and I have to hit the lock button to wake it. Settings...been there done that. Not a big deal, just a PITA when I have it parked on a stand and try to use just one hand.

Update 9/26/20:
Battery life is not good.
Wifi is not stable.
Battery:
I took it off a charger at the office at 100% 23 hours ago, currently at 89% with zero usage (took it off the charger, closed the cover, and dropped it in my bag; just looked at battery now out of curiosity).
If I forget to charge it and it's at 20% or less, I can't start a Teams call on it.

Wifi:
It will arbitrarily drop bandwidth and then connection entirely, but then reconnect ok.
Imagine this; you're on a Teams call, and suddenly everyone freezes. Then they come back and Teams asks, ""Bandwidth low, do you want to turn off video?"" Then a few minutes later, the call freezes again, and you pull down status to find wifi disconnected.
This isn't so bad when watching a movie or doing work that doesn't need real-time connection, but quite disruptive to live collaboration calls.
It happens on all wifi networks while other devices on the same networks see no disruption.

If I wasn't past the return deadline, I'd consider returning it based on these flaws. It would be a lifesaver if I could plug in the USB-c dock and use GB ethernet, but I'm not hopefull that will ever come. Just have to hope now that someone will notice and fix wifi and battery with an update that doesn't kill performance. This thing is still a blowtorch...",Configuration: M10+ 2GB/32GB
