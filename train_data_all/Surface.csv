  The Amazon ordering was flawless, as always. The Surface Pro 7 is an upgrade from a Surface 4 I purchased four years ago. This is used daily by a school teacher for virtual learning and handles all tasks well. The Surface 4 was getting a little slow with the number of resource-intensive applications used and it was time for newer hardware. Another fine product from Microsoft!

  First a big Thumbs-up to ProPrime and FedEx who shipped my Surface Pro 7 to the other side of the globe within 4 days of ordering - very impressed!As for the Pro 7, so far very happy. Build quality is good and I havee been able to use my HP Pen on it without issue, negating the need to spend more money on something I already have.The onscreen keyboard is not great though - during the setup there were a couple of times where I could not type in details and had to push all around the screen to try and get the keyboard to appear. Even after updating to the latest version of Windows, this did not improve.Talking of setup, this was very easy and after logging in with my Microsoft details, I was up and running within an hour.Very handy tool when meeting with clients!

    SP7 Keyboard Connection Hardware Defective
  
",1.0,GP,"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  Bought bundled but keyboard connection was inconsistent.  SP7  had to be restarted all the time to use the keyboard and disconnects after a a few minutes, SP7 was later determined defective not the keyboard.  Additionally, matte black finish was easily scratched on the edges especially in the bottom of the folding stand.  Also noticed imperfection in the paint job with a small clump of paint near the logo.  Terrible quality control.  Returned to a Microsoft store during my travel in California and replaced with a new SP7 but I had to purchase extended warranty for the store to replace with a new unit.  The new replacement SP7 paint job is noticeably better coating since it's holding well after a week use.  0 star for Microsoft poor production quality control but 5 stars for the customer service provided by Microsoft Westfield Topanga Canyon store for offering the replacement.

  This is really a nice product. I love the ease of use, the design, the speed. Seriously, I can't say enough good or anything bad except for the price. When all was said and done for the Surface Pro and keyboard with sales tax - total was just over $1000. I honestly think that it seems well overpriced based on all the shopping I did when I needed to replace my computer. I reluctantly returned this - buyers remorse - and purchased an open boxed, excellent condition Surface Go with mouse, keyboard and pen for a little over half the price of Pro 7 which I am finding is a suitable alternative. I wish I could have justified the cost because I like a bigger screen normally the Go is only 10"" compared to the Pro which is 12"".

    Great improvement from surface pro 3
  
",5.0,RedBaron,"Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had the surface pro 3 for years prior to this. I decided to upgrade and I'm glad I did. Some of the improvements I like are:  -writing is so much smoother plus in one note it is very sensitive to how much pressure I put down with pen and the angle when using pencils  -faster for sure and it runs many things at once with no issues. I also installed a lot and got it all done within a hour  -the hello face recognition is easy to set up and makes signing in a breeze  -battery life at least for now is great. This is biggest reason I updated. I used for 7 hours yesterday and still had 40%  -picture is a lot more crisp with better colors and sound had definetly improvedOverall, I highly recommend. The fact you can change from a solid laptop to a solid tablet within seconds is incredible. I have had good luck with Microsoft products and so far this is the same.

  A few months ago, I had contractors working in my home and during the process someone stole my Lenovo Yoga laptop & an iPhone.  After going through the 4 stages of grief I did my research and settled on an HP Laptop.  I was happy with it for the 45 days I had it until the cooling fan failed and the device started producing errors and shutting down.  HP support assured me they would take care of it but during that period I ended up buying a surface go which was too slow for my preferences and then ultimately settled on this.  This tablet is awesome!!!  I love it's portability, performance  & price.  It really is a great value at this price point and even if I sit it on a blanket all day it WILL NOT overheat like my other laptops do under heavy load since there are no vents to block on the surface.  Don't hesitate, buy it.  HP returned my laptop after 5 business days (Go HP!!!) but I still prefer and use this 80% of the time and it's the only computer I travel with now because of it's portability.

  I purchased this computer and was very excited to use it. I'm a student and don't use it for anything special. just Simple basic use.Now listen, after just four months the computer started to get stuck every few hours. Sometimes it just doesn't move and should really be turned off by long pressing the shutdown button and sometimes it wakes up after a few seconds of being stuck. This is an unbearable situation. i Do not recommend this surface pro 7 at all. By the way, I realized that it happened to many more people who bought this computer.In addition, Microsoft's service is inaccessible and I was unable to contact them to fulfill the warranty.

  Do not buy this as a replacement for a laptop or even as a tablet. I am a windows guy and was always fascinated with the surface but this thing is just an overpriced scam. Sure is runs windows which many people find useful but thats about all it can do. Its tablet functionalities and features are far inferior than than of its competitors. Not to mention the cheap cameras they  include, None of this justifies the  over $1000 price for the high end i7 model. GO with the newest iPad pro instead. It offers similar power with a better camera and more features than this garbage. Also its significantly cheaper at 1099 for their top of the line model and up to about 1400 if you get the maxed out 1 terabyte version.  ON the other hand the Surface pro 7 when maxed out can go up to 2000 dollars for less of the quality.

  Before purchasing this I was going to buy the Dell XPS 13 2020 model because of the ultra portable design, but it was $300-$400 more. So I decided to buy the SP7 and I really enjoy it. I am a CS student and needed a fast, portable, and long lasting pc. The keyboard is really nice and the layout of the keys are perfect. Also the keyboard is backlit which is really nice thing to have. Two things, Like others have mentioned, yes it’s 2020 and the screen bezel should be thinner and be pushed more to the edge but Eh, the screen ain’t that bad not to purchase it. Second thing, battery is terrible, this may drive people away from buying it. With my screen settings on low, I squeezed out 7 hours out of the battery with only doing homework online. Other than bezel and battery, I still recommend this to anybody.

  I bought my device in january after doing alot of reviews, I used to be an apple user. Everything was great with the device until 5 months later. It has randomly blue screened at times, and also when going to turn on my tablet it also will error and show the windows logo and then start glitching and not turn on. Im technology savy and I'm absolutely shocked that this tablet is already having issues within the first 4-5 months of purchase.....especially after spending 1K for it. Mind you I use my tablet for school and very minimal things such as zoom, social media accounts, podcasting, and editing photos. I've never in my life had a computer/tablet start to malfunction after a short amount of time. I can't figure out who to communicate with either to get this problem corrected if i go through amazon, or microsoft, although amazon is a verified seller so I'd assume it would be through amazon, but searching their site I cannot find any resources to help me resolve this issue or even replace it for another device and I turn it back in. I'm also very nervous as I currently just started school and have no other backup device is this completely goes down. AMAZON, I hope you see this review and can help me resolve this issue. And I hope this helped others with deciding on whether or not to buy. Otherwise the device has great screen resolution, light and compact, and very easy to use.

One of these days I'll get around to installing my other games on it, I just haven't had the time.  The OS is just like all other Windows 10, so there wasn't a learning curve there for me.It didn't want to start one night after it had been sitting in a cold car for a couple hours (I went and had dinner\drinks after work), which freaked me out, but a hard restart and a charge fixed it up.Major improvement over my old HP (that is running Windows 7) and definitely way better than my old Dell (which still runs XP).I'll update this review as things come up!

  When I first got the surface I was worried that it would be a dud based on other customer reviews especially considering how cheap it was. And initially, I DID run into some issues on the first day because it froze randomly and shut down just as others have said. However, after downloading a firmware update on Microsoft's website it seems like this issue has gone and everything is working perfectly. If anyone plans on buying this laptop make sure you download the correct updated drivers and it may resolve any issues that you run into. The last surface pro I had was from 2016 and it still runs pretty smoothly so I'm hoping this one lasts just as long, if not longer.

  It is decently powerful, I wouldn't try to go full bore on 4k video editing, or rendering 3d models. But for light photo editing and little work projects/day to day productivity, it is great. The screen is easy to read, crisp and bright, the battery life is marginally decent. It's not overly annoying to me but I am not away from a plug for extended periods of time.I was also pleasantly surprised with the cover keyboard and touch pad...they are both actually really good and ""heavy Duty"".Overall the ergo on this device is great IMO it fits me very well. and it isn't so large to be obscene but it's so small that is hard to use. It has very little graphics capabilities, I was hoping it would be just powerful enough to play fortnite or some light games while on the road but alas It can only play some RTS and RPG (they are billions and Diablo 3 are great) type games. Shooters are pretty much unplayable especially in a online competitive nature...But this wasn't meant for games. Id suggest a ASUS G14 if you want a compact game capable machine. And I might have purchased that had it been out already especially since I pretty much always use this with the keyboard in a laptop layout. I prefer my Ipad Pro 10.5 for a media consumption device personally.But from a productivity standpoint I really enjoy it a lot and look forward to getting a lot of use out of it...if the G14 comes out and I feel like selling this and blowing some extra cash I might jump up...IDK but so far Im enjoying this wonderful little device.

    Type Cover makes for a nice laptop replacement
  
",4.0,ariy,"Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this as a secondary windows portable, primarily for use in routine tasks when I did not want to be tied to my desk.  I use it like a laptop, so there may have been less expensive, more traditional options that would have done the job, but I have been curious about Windows tablets, so when this came up for sale with the cover included, I jumped on it.  The utility of this machine, as with any computer, is going to depend on the tasks you want to perform with it.  Since I mostly use it for document editing, I can't imagine using it in tablet mode would be a very good experience.  The Type Cover is always attached.It actually doesn't work so well sitting on a lap.  On my short-legged, overweight frame, the stand is not sufficient to keep the tablet from falling off.  I have not used it in tablet mode, but i notice that it gets rather warm. Leaving the cover on and folding it to the back should provide enough insulation.  Feeling the keys press as you hold it is a little disconcerting, but the system knows to ignore that when the keyboard is at the back.As with any compact keyboard, the Type Cover makes some compromises to save space.  I would have happily given up some real estate on the spacebar, cursor keys, and left Ctrl key to get at least another Ctrl key on the right.  As a visually impaired user, I also wish there was another way to tell whether the function keys are going to be function keys or perform their alternate functions when pressed besides a light under the Fn key.  It seems the function toggles even when the Fn key is being used in conjunction with other keys.  For example, when editing, one can use the Fn pluss arrow keys to access Home, End, Pgup and Pgdn keys. This is handy, but also seems to toggle the function key row.Performance is good, at least for daily tasks.  I have not done anything to tax the machine, but I do not notice a significant difference between the Surface and my more powerful desktop PC with routine activities.  The facial recognition feature for login works great, even with my inability to look at the camera.  I don't know what that means regarding the system's ability to be fooled, but that doesn't concern me at the moment.I've had the Surface just a few weeks, but it is serving it's purpose well, even though I do have to use it on a TV tray.  A traditional laptop might have served me better, but I am not unhappy with my purchase.  It's compact, looks neat, and performs well.  If you live in a Windows world and want a tablet, this is a good choice. In my view, the Type Cover inclusion is a must.

",1.0,K. O.,"Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2019","









  
  
    
  I skipped the 5th and 6th iterations of the Surface and waited for the 7, I was truly excited about the new 10nm i7 processor, ram, better wifi... Unfortunately, the truth is that the new Surface model is a big, expensive, outdated disappointment… Not only the screen is exactly the same as on the previous model, it still doesn’t support HDR, or HDR+, OR 4k quality apps. Really? For $1500, in 2019 Microsoft gives us the cutting edge tech from 2016. Thanks! Furthermore, the built-in SSD is dreadfully slow, the new LPDDR4x ram is no faster than LPDDR3 and the new usb-c port doesn’t charge the device, seriously, even the most powerful, fastest chargers I have dint charge it, including the one that came with the tablet. Oh, and since the DP port is no longer there a usb-c to HDMI adapter is a must in order to connect an external monitor, which is an additional expense. The only seemingly positive change was Intel’s new WiFi6 chipset but it’s not nearly enough to justify the price premium over the Surface 6, besides, it freezes a lot and drains the battery quickly. There are, however, a few issues that are even more significant:1) Horrible, unacceptable battery life! Even at low brightness, with everything but Wi-Fi tuned off I can’t squeeze out more than 5 hours of work out of it, AFTER the firmware update.2) Both cameras suck in well-lit environments, in low-light situations they’re simply unusable.3) FAN NOISE is simply UNBEARABLE!!! And it's also on all the time because the tablet gets extremely hot very quickly, the processor throttles the speed and the tablet becomes dreadfully slow... While using MS Word! If you use photoshop or any other application that is power hungry then the processor will overheat even with the fan on and there is nothing you can do about it.Honestly, I'm extremely disappointed... This isn't an upgrade because an upgrade implies is an improvement over the previous model and the Surface Pro 7 is anything but an improvement. And I'm not saying that Microsoft has an evil agenda but, one might even say that they intentionally ruined this Surface Pro in order to sell more of the next,the one that will probably have actual improvements and will be usable for more than an hour.

    The Pros, Cons and Oks for the Surface Pro 7 (HR).
  
",4.0,,"Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2019","Pros:
• USB-C, Finally! As a past Surface Pro user, this was never a feature. With a USB-C, like any computer, you can do so much more with this device now. From headphones to connecting external 4k monitors, to charging this and other devices (USB-C chargers are 10x cheaper to get), to even connecting an Ethernet adaptor. About time Microsoft.
• It’s a very sold machine. I go no flex issues, the frame feels sturdy, and overall I felt that I can throw this in a bag and not worry.
• It’s light. Not IPad light, but enough that you won’t feel worried that you’re not going to bend it.
• The microphone set up on the Pro is a big upgrade. Skype calls from my parents came crisp and clear in an indoor, TV on, volume. The web video is what it is, but the microphone setup is a thumbs up.
• Cortana listens to you pretty well. I’m learning Spanish so translating even simple questions, from English to Spanish, Cortana does a lot better than either using Alexa or Google Assistant. Also questions about directions, weather, and others were spot on.
• Excellent display. The screen is bright, outstanding saturation/color balance, and also offers ambient light sensing when it gets dark. When you go to settings you can modify it for a specific time, or it will automatically adjust when the sun goes down in your location.
• Microsoft mastered the kickstand on this. Numerous ranges of all angels, and is even quite steady when it’s placed on my lap.
• microSD reader (for upgraded memory option)
• Headphone Jack. I find this feature a must if you’re planning to edit videos on this.
• Solid State Drive (SDD) on a tablet size is one of the best things. If you have to choose, always an SSD, regardless of memory size. Faster, cooler, and
• Charging on this is very fast. From 0 to 50% it took around 45-50 minutes. Note that I was using the charging cords that it came with. Don’t expect the same results when using an off-brand.
• A lot of horsepower for a tablet. Inside is an Ice Lake processor. To summarize, it features smaller transistors that makes multi-tasking an non-issue. Trying out for the first time with around 10 apps running (Madden, Netflix, Live Maps, Grand Trims Mo, etc.), the machine had no lag or hiccups. Largely the effects of this chip will be appreciated in the next 2 years from when you get this tablet.
• The processor allows Wi-Fi 6 to be enforced on this tablet. This area is still new but within the next year, this tablet will already be up to date with the hardware. Meaning stronger upload and download rates.
• The speakers shoot sound directly to my face. Turning on Spotify, I got a decent quality in sound. With rock and country, I got a very balanced, and a lot of power in the volume. For the average listener it’s quite good. Not IPad level but still good to make the list.
• I can see the 3:2 screen a benefit for those who want to read, show notes, and display documents at work. Not many tablets can provide this without losing some quality. For me, I saw no waste in this Surface.

Cons and Oks:
• The chunky bezel. Stick to the times Microsoft, this can’t be ignored in 2019. It’s very thick and with competitors providing bezel-less frames, or close to it, this is a major turn off (Not to mention that Microsoft itself has a Surface Pro X with a design that is significantly less in the bezel. (Why not this one?).
• With the bezel issue, the screen size makes the tablet look 2 years older than what it is.
• Last year's model and this one are 99% the same in design. Remove the USB-C connector and it’ll be 100% the same. A very outdated design as I think Microsoft invested all their money on the internals and just forgot about the redesigning.
• The battery life isn’t great. I’m getting around 8 hours of power. That’s having Wi-Fi always on, web surfing, daily YouTube playing, and a couple of hours with Netflix (plus a couple of smaller apps). It can last a whole day if you control your power and your screen display, but it’s nowhere near what Microsoft is saying.
• Don’t take it outside on a sunny day. That sun glare is too powerful for this display brightness.
• Keyboard and Surface Pen are sold separately. I didn’t test these as you only get the tablet.
• Even though USB-C is a great thing to have, we’re already in the USB 3.1 world. With also no Thunderbolt 3 (quick file transfer) I wish that Microsoft put more effort into the outside design as much as they put in there hardware on this machine.
• I found no issue playing Overwatch on this but trying to play Call of Duty forget it. This isn’t for deep gaming and playing Overwatch killed a decent chunk of the battery.

Bottom Line:

If you’re going to buy this, you need to at least invest in there keyboard cover. It’s disappointing that to fully experience your Pro, you need to put down money on its keyboard and pen. Without a keyboard, from my experience, you’re pretty limited. I used a Logitech Bluetooth keyboard and mouse, but the portably is limited if you can’t attach them to the Surface Pro.

Also we're in the age of laptops, tablets, and phones trying to reach the goal to be bezel-less. I have the previous model on hand and I can’t tell them apart in any way. Thanks to these 2019 new laptops/tablets, the bezels on this device make it feel like this tablet is from 2017. I’m also irritated that Microsoft didn’t at least try to improve the design.

But if you can deal with the design (and the battery) issues, you’ll know that Microsoft put all their money on what’s inside the system. From the new core processors, this tablet is a beast. I found it very fast, reliable, and it will stand its ground for 2+ years. For me that’s the beauty of a Surface Pro: a PC in the size of a tablet. I’m always a PC fan and this performs as if I had a laptop on my lap, something an IPad can’t do. If you can deal with the generic bezel look, and put money down for their keyboard, you’re getting a beast of a computer fitting in a tablet.

Overall: An outdated design that packs a lot of power for those who want more than just a generic tablet on the go.

Hope I was a help to you.

  I received this from my workplace after having been on a Mac for most of the past 8-9 years.  Aside from the learning curve of switching back to windows, there are a bunch of things that a poorly done about the Surface.1.  Windows management.  I have multiple monitors set up and I'm constantly trying to rearrange the windows to fit on just one screen.  All of my notifications show up in the corner between the three screens making them unreadable.  This alone makes this product a fail.2.  Tablet Mode is useless.  I've only used tablet mode for a few minutes, but you have to select that you are in tablet mode and it doesn't really appear to be designed to be a tablet.3.  Removable keyboard is cool.  Gives me more room for my old school paper notebook on my desktop.  I'd love to use the key board as a wireless keyboard, but evidently Microsofts industrial designers and software engineers did not go the extra mile to make that possible.  That would have been cool, but was a fail.4.  The kickstand is a neat idea, but when I want to use this laptop, on my lap, I have a kickstand sticking in my legs and the removable keyboard doesn't have any structure to it.  So it sort of fails as a laptop in addition to failing as tablet.The idea is great, but the industrial design and software engineering are woefully lacking.  Microsoft delivered the minimum.

  I was a user of a Surface Pro 4 i5 256gb 8gbRAM and really loved it. I used it for more than 3 years. I decided to reinvest in a new Surface pro 7 i7 256GB 16GBRAM. First thing I noticed, It is slower than the previous one, which is ok since the processor runs slower normally to save battery life and boosts when needed. There comes the problem. It becomes hot (normal hot, but noticeable) and super noisy. A noisy cooler is started almost everytime you are using the computer for office, navigation, etcLast but not least, after two months of normal use, the microsoft keyboard case stopped working with my Pro 7, I switched back to the pro 4 and it worked perfectly. I then contacted Microsoft and they said that it is a known issue and they will replace my laptop! But I live abroad, so I will have to wait for 6 months till I travel to US. Good customer service though, but the product quality is way below the surface pro 4 series.

    HINDSIGHT IS 20/20. Fanless design throttles CPU at 73%. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!
  
",2.0,JESUS SAVED ME,"Reviewed in the United States March 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  I want to address the CPU: It has great potential, but all the potential in the world is useless when in practice, it isn't realized.That's exactly the case of this Surface Pro 7. On paper, it's great, but in practice, it falls on its face, cancelling any benefits of its newer hardware.Its i5-1035G4 throttles at 73%. In over two decades of working with computers, I have NEVER had a CPU throttle in my life before this Surface Pro 7. NEVER!!!Do you know what that throttling at 73% means? It means that you don't get to use all the processor's power. You have lower headroom.My Toshiba Satellite P755's puny i3-2310M from 2011, even with a dirty fan and the old thermal paste that has never been replaced since then, can effortlessly run the same project in FL Studio 20 that chokes the Surface Pro 7, never going past 70%, and being able to reach 100% when necessary.On the other hand, while this new Surface Pro 7 has a way faster, way newer (8 years) i5-1035G4, it can't run that project my older, slower laptop can. It overloads earlier with twice the core count and the higher IPC. THAT IS PATHETIC!The i3 on my S5261 is, not exaggerating, an antique in technology years, A TOTAL RELIC, yet runs Windows 10 perfectly and performs better than the Surface Pro 7 on FL Studio 20 with STOCK PLUGINS, which are CPU efficient.Why would I further test it, when it falls on its face with a light load?The i5-1035G4 is a good CPU...IF IT'S COOLED PROPERLY. The thin, fanless design of this Surface Pro 7 hinders all its great potential. It's a good-looking design, but it's a compromise on the performance.Such compromise makes this computer totally useless for any power use...you know...FOR USING THE CPU'S CAPABILITY IN ALL ITS ENTIRETY, as it was designed to be used. It's Microsoft's fault, not Intel's. They decided to release a gelded product even though the design hasn't changed for years. It's laziness.There is no getting around the fact that the passive cooling of the Surface Pro 7 will never let the CPU fully stretch its wings.I will probably return it. It's just a paper-weight if it's employed for anything other than light use.I bought it to replace my old Toshiba. Well, THAT AIN'T HAPPENING!Tweaking the Power Options yields even worse performance, meaning, this design is running on the edge. It's as good as it can get, and that's not good!EDIT: I ended up returning it. I used the refund money to order an AMD Ryzen 9 3900X on Amazon, along with other parts to build a new computer. Not portable, but it's a total beast of a system for 4K video editing in DaVinci Resolve. God bless!

  No where near as good as the Surface Pro 6, and that's an understatement! Since I've this model I've had to reinstall Windows 10 six times so far! Once it completely lost the battery information in the taskbar! Just yesterday it ran the July 1909 update and killed my Outlook... uninstalled and reinstalled office... Finally had to wipe Windows and start over to get Outlook back. Windows 10 2004 update is not even available for this model yet!! I've had my Surface Pro 3 and 6 upgraded for two months now!! Microsoft messed up big time on this POS! The pens aren't compatible! At least the power supplies are compatible. The only good thing is this has USB C!!! Too bad the rest of it is undependable...

    Unreliable - Don't ask much from it. But it's pretty
  
",2.0,Bruce Girrell,"Reviewed in the United States August 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought the Surface Pro 3 because I needed a small, portable computer for dedicated use in data acquisition. Aside from software and driver updates, this computer never sees the internet. It is tricked out as much as possible in speed, RAM and storage.The first problem I encountered is that when the machine starts getting hot, the first thing it does is throttle back the USB. A camera that I use runs at 100 frames per second when the computer starts up but after getting warm the USB can barely manage 10 FPS, sometimes less. The USB3 connection was one of the main reasons why I chose the computer. I have found that keeping ice packs behind the computer keeps the USB running at full speed, but that puts a bit of a crimp on the portability of the device. Many measurements are made in the field so I have to freeze packs and carry them along with the rest of the gear.I have persistent USB connectivity issues and the single USB port the computer provides allows the connector to wiggle a good bit. It doesn't give you the feeling of a solid connection.The next problem that I encountered was the disappearing cursor. The Surface is a tablet and it thinks that you want to touch the screen for control, so sometimes it gets very confused about whether or not to display a mouse cursor. But some of my programs don't accept touch screen input so I have a keyboard connected (always) for input. Still, the Surface will hide the cursor at random times. This is a well known problem but Microsoft's only answer is to reboot the computer - not a great idea in the middle of a data acquisition run.At times, I try to log on and the password type-in box is not visible. There simply is no way to log on to the computer. Rebooting doesn't help. This is also a known issue. The solution requires hard booting the computer (with the power switch) three times consecutively to activate a recovery screen.As you can see, aside from what I consider a low quality USB connector, I have been able to find workarounds for the challenges presented by the computer, but I was expecting better reliability for a machine that set me back a couple grand. And if I lose a data run because I can't control the computer, that data set (along with the time involved) is lost for good. It is extremely frustrating at times.

  I had the surface pro 4 before this one and still worked great. Decided to upgrade to 7 since I was starting med school. The first day I used it gave me a blue screen. I ignored it and blamed it on the HDMI adapter but every now and then I still get them.It heats up a lot. If I have my online class it will heat up tremendously and start getting very slow to the point I can't even work with it.The touch screen is nice, the surface pencil works great and I haven't had any problems with it while drawing on OneNote.Battery life is awful. Every 2-3 hours while studying I have to charge it.In conclusion: my surface pro 4 works better, except for the surface pen + touch screen.

  so far I am really liking this Surface. I got exactly what was ordered, new and sealed in the box. It was easy to set up and so far seems pretty snappy, the screen is great and I love the type cover. Battery life seems good, maybe not exactly as long as they claim. If I had to complain about one thing, it's  the useless face recognition which has not worked even one time. I hope to figure out how to disable it because it really does not work at all. Overall, I am really happy with the tablet.

  This Tablet is being Returned due to the dismal Battery life........As a 30 year IT professional I loaded this tablet up with my professional software and other typical programs. The battery time is totally unacceptable getting only around 5 to 51/2 hours of usage out of it MAX. The battery time that Microsoft advertises is 10.5 hours but there is no way to even get close to that number for the average professional user. It is a shame that Microsoft has a very nice product but their battery is a complete failure. Myself and a colleague wasted several days trying every option to get better battery performance even contacting Microsoft. They offered nothing but lip service knowing what they offered was worthless and their advertised Battery time was a complete lie. Turning off all background Apps and other utilities is NOT a solution Microsoft to get a few more minutes. Beware before you waste you time only to realize the battery is going to be an issue. Thankfully I was able to return it thru Amazon or I would have been stuck with a substandard product.

A bit disappointed with my experience considering this is my first surface device and had to deal with this issue considering that I paid to 60 Dollars to ship this device from U.S to Qatar. Hope this doesn't happen to other customers.UPDATE:i gave the surface pro 7 a chance, i didnt return the unit to amazon, was hoping a software update will fix the issue. I still experience from time to time the random freezing of the touchpad, just want to clarify only touchpad freezes, keyboard is working and system is responding.I have 2 years warranty from microsoft website on the machine if on the 1st year freezing still occurs ill send it for repairUpdate 2For the past 6 months of using it, my SP7 is free from the trackpad issue, not sure which update or firmware version i installed that fixed it. I just installed all updates from microsoft,  will continue to update if i experience the issue again

  There are a few annoyances with this product those being lack of thunderbolt 3, limited screen real estate coupled with big bezels and the biggest gripe of all being poor battery life compared to the competition (Hp, Dell and Lenovo).Now if you use the Sp7 indoors with the brightness set to around 50% then you can get at least 7.5-8 hours of battery which is average but not great, but if you use this outdoors or in a brightly lit area then you're forced to up the brightness which will kill the battery in around 4.5-5 hours. I found myself reaching for the charger 2-3 times in the day.Other than that the product is great (so far). if you're a student or a person who frequently views pdfs and word documents then the form factor is perfect. The sp7 is also part of intel project Athena making it quick and easy to log in and get work started for the day.Overall it's a good product but if you're someone who's not going to benefit from using this as a tablet regularly, you're better off getting another laptop.I will update this review if I find any other issues.PS. if you're an artist or some kind of digital illustrator, get an iPad pro over this product. There are several reviews online that complain about the line inaccuracy of the surface pen.

    It's ... Good... Not Great.
  
",3.0,Jayteebae,"Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  Can't say I've been blown away by the experience. It's a beautiful device but a bit overpriced if you ask me. Details below.....Preface: If you love fiddling with your device constantly - this is the one for you. If you prefer something a bit more pick-up and go - try the Surface laptop (or laptops in general). So, take my criticism with a grain of salt as I'm openly admitting to preferring laptops or any device that is all one piece. Note: I purchased the 128gb version with an alcantara poppy red type cover + pen.Battery Life: It wasn't great but that's a non-issue for me since they've introduced USBC (I have USBC chargers everywhere). What did bother me was the fact that I was constantly managing the performance vs. battery saver mode and feel that Microsoft should optimize the OS to smartly take care of this without my intervention. You'll notice the system quickly becomes jankier once the power source is removed (even after messing with these settings).Performance: It's great while plugged in or not while using energy saver settings. It could even handle some light gaming using emulators that I'd installed. There were a few weird bugs where the tablet would go black for a few seconds after working on an external display, but I think that was a fluke. The device does get very, very hot so keep that in mind. I'm not sure if leaving fans out of the i5 model was a good idea. I will say there's something magical about plopping such a thin tablet down on your desk and having it connect to all your monitors with ease (especially if you use the Surface dock but that's another $100+!). If I were Microsoft, I'd copy the Nintendo Switch and make a less expensive Surface Dock 2.0 that allows the tablet to be set into it - giving you a no fuss desktop workstation instantly.Screen: It's bright and beautiful, but extremely reflective. This seems like a silly issue but after day-to-day use it becomes frustrating. I greatly missed the anti-glare coating that's present on my other devices. It also gets HOT against my palm while taking notes.Storage: Expandable storage is nice and allows for microSD cards - something that's lacking on the Surface Laptop (seriously, why is this only present on Surface Pros?). This feature makes getting the smaller SSD not such a bad idea since my 128gb card only cost me $18 and doubled my storage.Accessories: I love the surface pen and how superior it is to the apple pencil. It may not be quite as accurate but my handwriting is significantly better given the way they've manufactured the tip. The apple pencil on the other hand feels like I'm scraping a plastic toothpick against glass.... horrible. Also love the eraser! Surface type cover is fantastic and adds much needed functionality to the device. The keys are an absolute joy to type on and the material is soft and deliciously luxurious. You can use your older type covers or buy a new one like I did. My only complaint is that I found myself fiddling with the folding/unfolding of this cover and the kickstand constantly and I think this just might be my inclination towards laptops - and not a problem with the device itself. Lastly, the trackpad was a bit too small vertically.Apps/Software: It's..... OK. This area is easily my biggest gripe with the device. I was able to find most of what I use on a day-to-day basis but there's quite a few missing from the Microsoft Store. Luckily the Surface Pro 7 offers a desktop class experience so you can install  .exe programs like BlueStacks to gain access to android apps and the like. Keep in mind your battery life will tank running heavy programs like this. I'm a bit peeved that an office subscription doesn't come with this considering its premium Microsoft hardware. If you do get a subscription to Office 365, then they need to make it more obvious because I could not figure out how to redeem it. It's also strange that they have default windows apps like Mail which cannibalizes Outlook. Choices are nice, but wouldn't it be smarter to give your surface users the superior software which may in turn garner more subscribers? Tablet mode is lacking polish which is the status quo for Windows. The icons are poorly optimized... tiny and hard to hit with your fingers. Menus seem to pop out at random due to bad palm rejection. I found myself tapping on something 4-5 times just to get it to open or activate. Not sure if the screen is defective or if the OS is just too laggy to register my touch. Yes, there are touch gestures such as swiping from the left to show all apps or swiping down to close -- but these aren't fully fleshed out and the system would constantly freeze/stutter if I used them. I'm a bit surprised that Microsoft has not perfected this given the length of time their Surface line, (which is primarily a tablet), has been on the market. I want to say that even Windows 8 tablet mode was smoother but maybe that's my imagination...? Just keep in mind you're purchasing a PC with the option of being a crappy tablet. Side-note: The Bluetooth and wifi chips on this device are miles ahead of anything apple is offering.In conclusion, I decided the Surface Pro 7 just wasn't for me and may end up going with a Surface Laptop. This is due to the fact that the price ($800+ for all required accessories that I'd need) didn't match the overall package. Software is still very unrefined in tablet mode, apps are lacking, performance is just okay, and I think the annoyance of so many moving parts + software drama (folding/unfolding kickstand + flappy type cover + pen that would fall off at times + poor palm rejection or general software bugs) just contributed to the frustration of the device.  I just want something that is wholly solid and can be used without much fuss - thus why I prefer to sacrifice any hopes of sticking with this crappy tablet experience and move on.

  I bought a new Surface Pro 7 (actually from Best Buy, not Amazon) and ended up taking it back and exchanging it because the screen brightness kept changing randomly. The next one had the same issue. It turns out it is because of an Intel Graphics setting you can’t actually change because the Microsoft version of the driver doesn’t allow you to use Intel’s control panel. I spent hours figuring out how to fix that, but there are so many other bugs I’m going to return it anyway. I’ll provide a list of the other issues I’ve had so far.1. WiFi won’t use 5GHz unless I go into setting and disable 2.4GHz.2. The on-screen keyboard occasionally decides not to enter any text. Hitting buttons does nothing. Have to restart for it to work again.3. The surface dock display output goes blank for 2-3 seconds every 2 minutes or so.4. It won’t detect my external monitors via USB-C at all.5. It won’t detect and connect to my hotspot without me changing the password on the hotspot, forgetting the connection in the Surface, and manually reconnecting. Not sure if it’s the Surface’s fault if my iPhone, but no other device I’ve used the hotspot with has had that problem.6. FaceId (or Windows Hello or whatever it’s called) has entirely given up. Says it can’t turn the camera on every time now.7. I can’t adjust screen brightness anymore. Only shows two levels and neither actually do anything.I think I’m going to get a Lenovo X1 Tablet instead. I wanted to love the Surface, but it is so glitchy I can’t stand using it.

  Amazon is the seller of all products not the manufacturer.  Otherwise its BS business! Bought a surface pro 7 for 899.00. 32 days later the screen doesn't work and Amazon doesn't honer a return, claiming its longer than 30 days.  Microsoft then determines it's a manufactured defect which entitles me to a used test pro 7 that they had laying around, and not a new pro 7.  Don't buy Amazon computer products. Just send a check to China or buy from someone else.  And NEVER buy Microsoft.

    a hot mess
  
",2.0,Arkenstone,"Reviewed in the United States October 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  My IT department warned me not to buy a Surface despite its appealing features because they are unreliable.  Nonsense, I thought, thousands of people are using them, so they must work, right?  Wrong.  My Surface crashes constantly in Zoom when using the pen, especially since the Windows 10 version 2004 update.  Just draw a bunch of lines on the whiteboard and erase them and watch it crash.  I've already replaced the device and spent hours with MS tech support and my own IT department and nothing helps.  Usually just the display resets, but other times the whole machine freezes and requires a hard reboot.  Either way it's completely unreliable.  Maybe someday an update will fix the problem, but who knows.  It's a shame because it would otherwise be a great upgrade to my Surface Pro 3, which works fine.Update:  the KB4580364 update says ""We fixed an issue that causes a device to stop responding after you have been using a pen for several hours.""  I ran into the problem a lot faster than that but now it may be fixed.  Zoom 5.4.1 fixed the display resetting with hardware acceleration (although the pen resolution is worse).  So a year after it was released, this device may now be usable.  The hardware is actually quite nice when it works.

  I wanted to like it, but unfortunately the network issues are making this computer very unreliable. Suddenly the network card stops responding, and it makes the mobility part of the table/laptop almost useless, because I have to watch out and see if when I disconnect the power cord or something else, to take it from my office to downstairs, the network is still there or whether I have to start troubleshooting it, often rebooting it and closing all my open apps. Anything can trigger it, from disconnecting the power cord, taking keyboard off, monitor cable, etc. Playing with the power saving mode settings of the network card sometimes work, and to my understanding that is the issue. Starts working again about as random as it stopped.I recently purchased a WIFI USB dongle, to see if I can get around it, but that means I will have this USB port occupied... when I could've used it for an external mouse. I hope Microsoft and Intel can make this work, but until then my 1 star review will stay.

    Horrendous Support
  
",1.0,George Eliot,"Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  The product itself is decent. It's not perfect, but I'm not going to pretend the hardware itself is deserving of a 1-star rating. My concern is Microsoft's inability or unwillingness to provide support, which absolutely obliterated my view of their brand.I bought this product as part of bundle at a warehouse store, and within 2 months, I experienced two failures. First, my Surface Pen stopped working (the Microsoft official one, not a 3rd party device). After 2 hours (!) chatting with their service team, they finally decided to ship me a new one, but only after I sent back (and they received) the non-working one. I have no problem returning the old unit, but most companies at least ship the replacement immediately so you're not stuck waiting longer. So that irritated me a bit, but no big deal in my mind.Less than a week after the Surface Pen quit working, the whole device stopped booting up. I believe it was a faulty Windows security update that did it. The hardware's likely fine, but I needed to contact support to get the thing working again. However, contacting support has been an absolute disaster. I have now attempted over a dozen times in 3 days to reach someone - ANYONE - who can help me resolve this issue, and I've gotten nowhere. The Surface Support team has been completely unresponsive, providing nothing but an automated message stating they're not open despite my calling exclusively during the hours they state they're offering service. I also tried Windows Support, and while I finally did get a rep to attempt to help me reinstall Windows, the chat cut off in the middle of the process and now every time I attempt to connect to support at all, it just says I'm connected but doesn't give me any representative to speak to.On several other occasions I got to their first-level support agents, whose role is to direct inquiries to the correct department, and they've also been completely unable to connect me with anyone who can help. At this point, I am completely unable to contact anyone at any level, and Microsoft has done absolutely nothing to resolve this issue. My device is well within the warranty period, and since this is most likely a software issue, fixing it shouldn't even cost them anything, so I don't understand what the issue is.I have also made it clear to MS support that this is my primary work computer, and I have now been completely unable to use it for 3 days and counting. I am a very, very patient customer and rarely complain, but I am so thoroughly dissatisfied with my experience that I felt the need to share it with other potential customers.Because of Microsoft's evident disregard for their customers, I will be returning my device to the store and replacing it with a product from a more responsive company. I have also filed a formal complaint with the Better Business Bureau in the hope that this experience will be heard and addressed by Microsoft for future customers.

  Suits my needs perfectly.  Needs to travel light, have a keyboard for doing real work (a tablet without a keyboard is nearly pointless.)  As for some of the most common criticisms I read before buying.""Bezel too large."" No, the bezel is perfect.  You need a bezel of decent size to actually use a tablet like a tablet. Otherwise you will accidentally activate the touchscreen.  This love affair with screens going to the edge is like the popular open floor plan in houses - looks great on a tour, but in real life is mostly terrible when you suddenly hear pots, pans, and dishes clanging in the kitchen echoing through the entire level of the house.  You need a bezel for a tablet. Period. Without one, or having one that is too small, you cannot use a tablet properly.""Battery life.""  How long do you really need a battery to last?  I can use the tablet on and off throughout the day without worrying about a charge.  Charge it once a day (overnight) unless you plan to use it all day for streaming video conferences.  You can't expect to not have to charge a device for 2-3 days.The touchscreen works tremendously well. The keyboard attachment is just perfect (backlit buttons are an essential item to have on any keyboard on a notebook).Only complaint is that I wish the power cord had a slightly stronger magnet. It seems a little bit too easy to accidentally knock out.If your needs are similar to mine, this will be a great device for you. If they are not, it may not be as good of a fit for you, but it is hard to fault the design of the product.

  I cannot stress how amazing the surface pro is for creativity. I used to have an ipad pro but when the battery died I decided to try this out, this versiin comes with a keyboard but you will have to get a stylus separately and trust me the surface pro stylus is the one you want, the knock off brands won’t stay magnetized to the side and will get lost within two days.I’ve had laptops and I’ve had tablets, having the functionality of both is amazing. It comes with microsoft white board and microsoft to - do, I use the white board to make bubble graphs to get organized then typing it up into a to-do which has an app I can download on my phone so I always know my scheduleBattery as you’re using it lasts around 4 hours, but standby doesn’t drain nearly at all.I originally got this for on the go editing, and for smaller scenes it works great, but owing 8 gb ram can’t handle bigger stuff (not a deal breaker at all tbh) It handles 1080p footage just fine using sony vegasYou can also use this for song recording, I use presonus and I can’t tell you how nice it is to be able to record and look at google docs for lyrics on the same device. One gripe about programs that monopolize the surface pro’s audio device, you may have to disable the speaker temporarily to get the audio to come through headphones, bluetooth or otherwise.I haven’t tried gaming on this, but tbh I probably will actively avoid that because I love having this as a creative work station.The keypad is surprisingly comfortable to write on on just about any angle, which I’ve never been able to say about any laptop I’ve had. Being able to flip the keyboard back to aid in being a kickstand and not worrying about keyboard presses is nice as wellSo yeah, stylus is amazing for creativity, being able to record, write, and edit all on the same device that fits on a music stand : priceless.

While in the continuous WiFi use, battery use is faster and doesn't last for 10 hrs ( lasts for 5-6 hrs). The UI experience with app opening and work out is fluent. {After 1 week of use}Update after 2 months same experience

  The hardware is great but it would be a lot more effective if it actually came with the settings application installed. It's impossible to use half of the functionality of the computer, and most of the fixes I've found require you to go through the settings, which doesn't exist. I was really excited about getting this new computer but it has become a greater hassle than an asset at this point.

  The surface pro feels and functions like what it is -a cheap attempt at a laptop. I wish I had spent a couple of hundred more and got a Dell. It is not very responsive and the touch screen is a pain as it really only works with the pen (I assume) update, it died after 3 months

  Si quieres un equipo superliviano, eficiente, transportable y cómodo, cómprate surface pro 7 de Microsoft.
