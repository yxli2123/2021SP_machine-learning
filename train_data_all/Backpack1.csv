  This backpack is great! It has lots of storage space and it's just darm cute! I love the fact that it has side pockets inside and outside. The day I recieved it, it was raining hard. I tested it and my paper books are dry! I usually carry a medium backpack for everyday use. And with this upgrade to a large, being able to hold all my items with extra space, has been wonderful! Totally recommend!

  I really like this backpack. It's super cute and well made. I love the patterns, I have the pink floral one. It's big with lots of pockets for storage. It would be perfect for carrying a laptop, although I don't use it for that. The main pocket opens up really wide so it's easy to access everything inside. It would be good for traveling as it has a strap to hook it on your suitcase and it's super spacious. I mainly use it as my everyday bag for work, but I'm planning on also using it when I go on trips because it's honestly such a great backpack. I love it and I'd definitely recommend!

  I love this backpack. I am a college student and this backpack is perfect for me needs. Very protective for my laptop and ipads and the sleeve for electronic devices is slightly higher on the inside so if you sit your backpack down a bit quickly without thinking they don‚Äôt hit the ground hard. A good amount of pockets and space and it even charges my phone! Great great purchase I‚Äôm surprised it isn‚Äôt more expensive. Oh and i also like that it has pockets for a waterbottle or umbrella that aren‚Äôt mesh and that it has both backstraps but also purse handles if you choose to carry it that way.

  Save your money! After using this backpack for 6 months, the strap began to detach from the pack. Then zipper teeth fell off the zipper which cause one zipper to fall off. Then the final zipper did the same and now the backpack is no longer usable. When I contacted the seller about the strap they told me, basically - too bad, you're out of the return window. Move on to a different brand!! This company's backpacks will cost you twice the amount when you have to replace it.

  I ordered this bag, along with others, to be used for a personal item during a multi-continental  trip. I chose this one over the other options because of its space and the way it opened. It was also the cheapest of the choices. This bag exceeded my expectations and was the right choice. This bag endured 6 long flights. I stuffed it way beyond capacity, with enough clothes for 5 or days. It held up extremely well. I was able to put spare shoes in one side pocket with a water bottle in the second. I used the front pocket for toiletries. The built in charger was also an added bonuses. I did have to remove the items from the side pockets to be able to fit the bag under the seat on the plane. I loved the extra straps at the top that gave you the option of carrying it instead of wearing like a backpack. Purchase this bag, you won‚Äôt regret it.

  So far I am loving this backpack! It has so much space, but even when it‚Äôs full it doesn‚Äôt bulge out and become huge/wide like many other backpacks (the main reason I was backpack shopping in the first place). Right now it is holding my laptop, giant calculus textbook, a notebook, a whole set of extra clothes, and various other things such as chargers and a pen bag. So useful!The only negative I have to say is that I wish it didn‚Äôt have the handles on top‚Äîor it would be nice if they would at least lay flat, instead of sticking straight up 24/7. But that is a minor complaint :)

  As a college student often shifting from weekend activities to the school life, my backpack endures tremendous amounts of stress. However, this backpack is perfect for me because it holds up very well. Its waterproof finish prevents water damage from my water bottle or sprinklers on campus and its USB port ensures that my phone will never be low on battery. Its specialized pocket secures my laptop without worry. I can fit all my textbooks and am left with ample space to store anything I need. Some might say that a backpack this size is too excessive and large, but its design promotes maximum capacity and function with no impractical features. I definitely recommend this backpack because it will exceed your requirements.

  A very roomy bag. I am not a floral girl but I absolutely love this print and so happy I went with a pretty print over a solid. I needed a wide mouth bag for my camera gear and zoo trip, easily accessible.  My kids can get into the bag with no fuss or without me having to take it off to fight to open the main zipper.  It feels pretty durable, straps seemed a little thin but wearing it for an hour with water bottles and shoes on a outing I didn‚Äôt even know I was wearing a bag.  All pockets are big enough for bottles to slid in and out while not falling out.  Water has been kept out. All in all its the best bag I‚Äôve purchased for what I need it for.

  So I will admit, I wasn't expecting much from this bookbag but did see it was water resistant and because I walk everywhere thought eh why not give it a try! As soon I opened it I was impressed with the quality. Once I unzip it and opened it up I was impressed with how spacious it was and all the pockets and areas for things. The 1st time I used of course it had to rain, lightly but raining nonrheless. This kept everything nice and dry. I had laptop and tons of paperwork and not once did I feel it too heavy. The straps and nicely padded as well. I'm a teacher and bought this to use as my teacher bag and it's so well worth it!

  I love this bag! I got tired of using my shoulder laptop bag because I felt like my things were just thrown in there, but this keeps my laptop secure, has plenty of compartments for personal and stationary items. I'm only giving it 4 stars because I ordered the blue bag and was delivered the black bag with red roses. My colleague loved mine so much she ordered the blue bag and will be using it as a diaper bag! This bag has various uses!

    Diaper bag

  So I bought this to use as a diaper bag and it is amazing. This bag is already better than the actual diaper bag I was using previously. It has a good amount of pockets for organizing your things and the main compartment is great for diapers and wipes. The material it is made of seems to be very water resistant which is great because my last bag had milk and juice spilled in it fairly frequently. I am very pleased with this bag and if you are considering buying it I would highly suggest it.

  The bag is stylish and appears sturdy. The appearance is at least as attractive in person as it is in the photos! I thought it could be gaudy, but no, it's very pretty. I get loads of compliments on it. The zippers are a shiny gold, it has outside pockets that can snap shut, the carrying handles have reinforced stitching, and it has two little grommets on each of the fours straps. Additionally, the inside pockets are padded and have a velcro strap for added security.  The inside also has several smaller pockets including a zipper pocket-(I have not used the charging port, personally, so on comment on that.) It has some padding inside and several different pockets on the inside.  I also like the material- it's more like a ""pleather"" almost a vinyl so that's great for spills, but it looks nothing like your granny's vinyl tablecloth! It appears to be fairly water proof or resistant. As for travel, it seems a little bit on the heavy side, but I am short and not too strong, so that could just be me. I first began search on Land's End and other sites, but nothing really seemed at all attractive. Then I looked at Amazon and found this. It was WAY cheaper and I'm really enjoying using it! I would but it again if I needed another- or as a gift.Amendment: I have owned it for a while and I noticed that the stitches on one shoulder strap are loosening. I keep my laptop and several books in the backpack and it is heavy.  I think perhaps you should be careful about the weight. If it‚Äôs too heavy to be comfortable carrying by the handles (as opposed to the back straps) it may be more than the bag was designed to hold. I still like it and I use it almost every day.BONUS:  one of the inside padded pockets is designed perfectly  to hold a tablet/iPad.

  I'm a nursing student and my biggest struggle was carrying my binder, coffee and backpack at the same time so I needed something that would fit my 4"" binder in it. With the unique opening of the bag I definitely fit my binder and folders. Plus it has a laptop pouch! Also the pockets on the side have elastic so my tumbler and water bottles always fit! The built in pencil pouch was amazing to have also! I 100% recommend this bag! So much storage and very practical along with amazingly cute!

(I‚Äôm a masters student and have never owned a backpack this nice!) Pleasantly surprised that the quality over met my expectations!!! Such a fantastic deal for the price!

If you look to my last picture you‚Äôre able to see I splashed some water on the backpack to see if it was truly water resistant, I am pleased to say it passed this test! You know how many times I‚Äôve been walking to class and end up with a soggy backpack, and scared I damaged my MacBook Air laptop??? Not worried anymore! Hurry add this product to your cart today! Such a great deal and a super high quality item you can‚Äôt find in the store!!! (Competitors of in store brands are charging upwards of $50 for a low quality backpack that cannot compete with this one!) I will be using this for school, travel, airplane trips, cruise excursions, beach trips, day trip, Rainy day trips, etc!! Thank you so much! :)

  I have had this bag for a couple of weeks and it has easily become my favorite bag! I get lots of compliments on it. I travel a ton and am constantly doing small overnight trips. It's a perfect overnight bag or carry-on.  I love that there's a spot for both a computer and an iPad. I love that the bag is bigger than a typical backpack, but stronger than most bags due to the way the top opens - which makes me feel more secure about what I put in the bag, plus you can easily see and access everything as opposed to digging in more regular backpacks. It's easy to open the pockets and they even have a clasp at the top to hold the handles together which is a smart touch. While I am not a big fan of carrying an additional charging pack, I like that this bag gives you the option to do so. Great bag, would definitely recommend.

  I am more of a tote bag kind of girl, but I couldn‚Äôt seem to find one big enough to comfortably hold all of school supplies, so I broke down and bought a backpack. This backpack is big enough to hold all of my school essentials - my MacBook, a textbook, two notebooks, a 2-inch binder, and a Nalgene bottle - with room to spare. The main compartment opens differently than traditional backpacks, making it easy to access what you need without spilling everything else out. As an added bonus it doesn‚Äôt look bulky and the floral print is cute.

",4.0,Cella,"Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2021","









  
  
    
  I came across (and eventually purchased) this backpack because I recently invested in a 15.6 inch laptop...and for those of you who don't know, a 15.6 inch laptop is huge. Since I am a teacher and am working hybrid, I have to carry my laptop to and from school. My older backpacks were not cutting it, so I settled on this lovely item.There are some flaws in this backpack, but the pros outweigh the cons.First, the pattern is gorgeous. The colors and just as bright and bold as the picture shows.Next, this backpack is BRIMMING with extra features...I never knew a backpack could have so many options. There is plenty of storage space for everything. I can't even get into the amount of pockets and nooks and crannies this backpack has...if you're obsessed with organizing your things (like 'every item has a place'), this backpack is for you. You can even put a charging doc in here, and charge your items discreetly from the pockets. And yes, it does fit my 15.6 inch laptop with ease, plus my smaller Chromebook. (But then the backpack gets really heavy. More on that later...)Also, I like that this backpack has handles. So...if you don't feel like wearing it on your back, you can use the handles and use it as briefcase. Very clever!There are two things that are worth mentioning before you decide to purchase this. One, this backpack is not made of cloth, but rather a plastic-y material...I don't really mind that. However, because of this, I feel like stitching is not very durable or strong. This backpack - especially where the shoulder straps are - seems like it is not durable to last several heavy loads...which is a shame, because this would be ideal for a carry on.Only time will tell. I don't overload the backpack because I want it to last long, but then what's the point, I suppose?This definitely is a nice purchase, as I am super happy with the space and the overall look of this backpack. I will be sure to update the review if I see that the stitching it coming apart, but so far so good.

  I need a backpack for my daily commute to/from work to downtown Chicago and I travel on the bus. I carry my laptop, lunch and gym clothes/shoes. It fits but not as big as my previous backpack, a Herschel. I wasn't able to test the water resistance. Review below...PROS:- It's affordable- The print (black background with flowers) is nice/as expected in person.- The handle at the top are perfect for when you need to remove/hold your backpack on the bus/other tight spacesCONS:- The material is plastic/vinyl so you get that smell with the bag but it goes away eventually- No pads on shoulder straps: I carry a lot and go EVERYWHERE with my backpack on a daily basis. I imagine if I filled this to the brim, it wouldn't be comfortable on the shoulders while carrying it for an extended period of time. Also, the material during the summer might not be ideal.

  I just started working as a nurse and bought this bag to carry into the hospital with me. I like that it is large enough to fit my stethoscope case, lunch, ipad, and scrub jacket but is also made of a wipeable material. It does not fit in my provided locker but I'm able to fit it nicely out of the way on a shelf. I love that I can tuck the straps into the suitcase belt so they aren't dragging or hanging down on any surfaces. Small lock fits nicely through the zippers if I want to secure it further. And it's nice that there are little elastic pieces on the cup pockets to place my badge when I leave. Nice inner pocket available to place my small wallet for safe keeping. The bag itself isn't too heavy and the backpack straps, while not heavily padded, are comfortable enough to carry. The only thing I wish was different is I wish the velcro strap inside had a longer strip of velcro because it doesn't really meet in the right spot/ is too long. Otherwise, great bag!

  I was so excited to get this backpack! I have been looking for one that is sturdy and is more like a bag rather than a traditional backpack. This was a great choice for what I wanted. The quality seems sturdy and strong. The bag has great space and I love the water-bottle holders on both sides of the bag. I am eager to see how it handles travel later in the year when I travel more frequently. I am excited to use this bag and hopefully it will last me for years. The price seems worth it so far.

  I was very pleasantly surprised with this back pack. My daughter needed something ASAP and my budget was limited so I wasn't expecting great quality for $20.00. I was shocked when it came. Its sturdy, its weather resistant, it holds a TON of stuff, and she was really excited with the design. She's in middle school so she was happy to have something unique and cool. She can fit her full sized ipad, about 3 composition notebooks, a pencil pouch, a midsized make-up bag, an umbrella, a water bottle and her hoodie all in the main compartment. There is a front compartment and the side pockets for a water bottle that she doesn't use, but its nice that she still has space to expand into if she needs those extra compartments.  I highly recommend this bag for middle school aged kids and up. I would even reccomend it for travel as it really does carry a surprising amount of stuff. The ONLY thing I don't like about it and she finds a tad frustrating at times is that zipping/unzipping the main compartment is a little awkward. I think because the sides of the top opening bend at the ends. Theres like a flexible strip of metal or something in the seams and it doesn't always want to close easily. Even still, that's not a huge deal, just slightly annoying sometimes but totally worth it considering the quality of the bag. It looks like it would cost $50.00 minimum if you bought it at a department store.

I was able to fit my medicine in one compartment, hair and makeup things in another compartment, a sweater, my walking shoes AND my laptop and charger (and BTW the outer port  to enable me to recharge my electronics is the main reason I bought it!!) It was raining, but this wonder backpack repelled the water. The strap on the back allowed me the ease of sliding it securely on the handle of my rolling suitcase.

Makes it much easier to carry everything in one bag and not having to cart around multiple bags for everything. I would highly recommend this bag. I've already had to tell some mommy friends where to get one and that no it's not a typical diaper bag as it's a laptop bag but its handier than some of the very expensive diaper bags that some clueless childless person designs.

  I can‚Äôt say enough good things about this backpack. I carry too much to fit comfortably in a purse, but I didn‚Äôt want a plain school-backpack-looking backpack. The appearance is very pretty, nice pattern, bold colors, sparkly gold details makes this look like a much more expensive backpack. It has lots of storage. The outer pockets have a strong magnet closure. The front pocket has a zipper pouch and some other storage pockets, and holds more than I expected. The main compartment is awesome - 4 pockets, zipper pouch, and 2 separate spaces to place laptop/books/etc. It‚Äôs HUGE on the inside. Can hold quite a bit. I like the hand straps, and while I wish the back straps were a little more padded, it‚Äôs still quite comfy for the amount of stuff I carry in it. It has held up well so far. No fraying or issues with zippers. The material keeps it from getting dirty. I‚Äôve recommended to friends and family.

Laptop, charger, paperwork, My big Ole Coffee Flask (the dark Blue bottle in the pic) My makeup Bag, Even a huge Eyeshadow pallet, ladies!! I almost feel like I am traveling every day. (I work 45 min away, in another county) and it helps because I have to bring Breakfast and lunch some days. I ALSO go to Job Fairs as an Employer, and I bring all the applications in there, stacked neatly! The side Pockets are so wide, I can put a Shaker Bottle in it (the fat ones) and the Charger thing, works great (If you remember to charge your Power bank!) All in all, I am using it for alot of things. It is comfortable to carry, and it is definitely waterproof.  Its snowed and rained on me, and all my things stay dry. I dont stress about putting it on the floor, cause I just wipe it off clean. I swear Its the best thing since sliced bread. (To me)The front zipper area has alot of space to put pencils/pens, sticky notes, and even a stapler (at that Job Fair) it's been great. I haven't traveled, but I travel far daily for work, so it is pretty much my daily luggage. (Good for keeping your meds and Menstrual Pads tucked away)I hope y'all enjoy my review.

What i liked about the laptop pocket is how well it fits my laptop as it fits my 15 inch laptop very well. What i did not like about the backpack is the usb cable on the front, i just wish it was on the inside not the outside of the backpack just because i don't like my phone exposed to weather.

The feature on the outside of the bag that allows you to charge your devices was a bonus. I would recommend this bag for travel!

  I purchased this to use as a backpack purse.  The description was very accurate. I loved the print and large main pocket. Although, the description did indicate the dimensions, I realized after receiving it that it was ust too large to use as a purse.  Even though I love large purses. If the material had been a softer more broken in material I probably would not have returned it.  It would work great as a travel bag. I would highly recommend this for travel or a student, but not a purse.

  Absolutely love this bag! Bought it because I needed a new backpack as my first work backpack after graduation but also wanted something that would look nice/professional backpack for  laptop and travel.From the appearance, it is like a diaper bag!But its internal structure is different, it is a excellent laptop/ travel /work backpack. It suits all my needs even if I carry lots of documents,a power bank, a notepad, my 14 inch laptop, snacks/lunch, some name cards and pens.All of my items fit in this bag at once. I use it everyday to carry my stuff to work.I've been using it for almost a month now it serves it's purpose well. I do worry that the amount of items I carry would put stress on the stitching, but I haven't encountered any problems as of yet.I was satisfied that the ""laptop pocket"" was padded,because part of my reasoning for buying this bag was so I could have a separate space for my laptop so it wouldn't be damaged. I now use the zipper pocket to protect  my important documents or other items from being lost. And I love the diaper bag opening, no more digging blindly to find something.I also used it for travel since it has a lots of space,make it easy to carry clothes, my needed toiletries, snacks, my computer and all my other travel items.If there is any improvement that I could suggest to the company for this backpack, it would be an addition of a smaller zipped pocket on the shoulder straps of this bag as it is very helpful to carry boarding pass, itinerary, public transport cards etc. rather than opening the front pocket which is not always very accessible when you travel on buses/trains regularly.

Has RFID pocket, USB port & luggage strap. All 3 features other bags didn't that I looked at. Beautiful design & great quality material. Strong zippers & love the 2 reinforced handles on top when I want to carry it. It sits nice on my back & straps are wide but lightly padded so it doesn't feel bulky like some with thick padding.

  The stitching looks very good, the zipper hardware is fine, smooth, and sturdy. I have not tried out the durability of the 'coated' 'waterproof material. It is very spacious with compartments galore, so one should have enough pockets for everything. The lining does not be the most fine,  but it seems adequate. There are little gussets that allow a little more space for your iPad or flat objects. The magnetic snap closures are a nice detail as well as the elastic on the side pockets to secure the drinks. The USB charging port and the inner side pockets are added perks. This is a large capacity bag, so one might not want to overload it. The only thing  I would have added would be a back anti-theft pocket to put one's phone or passport. The front pocket does have a lot more organization than other bags, but I still look for a back pocket. Most importantly, it has its own unique look. Normally I would not have picked up a floral bag.

After walking 6 blocks with a laptop and 6 vintage vinyl records I noticed that the shoulder strap had ripped half way right where it is sewn into the bag.It hasn't ripped anymore and has been used regularly since March.

  I've had my bag for a week now. I love it. It fits everything I carry on a daily basis plus I have plenty of room for extras. I've even been able to put my lunch bad in it without any issues. The inside and outside elasticized pockets are great for holding water bottles and travel mugs as well as an umbrella. I can even see myself being able to throw a pair of ballet flats into one of the inside pockets during the winter for work. I did notice that one or two other reviews mentioned that their backpacks arrived folded in a storage bag which they felt compromised the integrity of the padding. However, my bag arrived the same way and when I took it out of the bag, I immediately took my laptop and put it in the backpack for a couple of hours. I haven't had any issues with the backpack tipping over. There is a thin hard board that sits on the bottom of the bag which helps with stability. This is folded up when you get it so I took some of my everyday items and sat them in the bottom of the bag to train it down. I believe this has also helped with the stability of the bag. I haven't seen any signs of issues with the straps but it's only been a week. I'll try to update my review if there is any issues. Otherwise, I've had so many compliments on my bag. It's probably the one bag I can see lasting me for a long time.

  This product is exactly what they say it is. If you in college its the PERFECT backpack. it has so many compartments in it makes organizing so much more easier and less cluttered. You might think its too small in the pictures but its the right size to fit 2-3 textbooks, a laptop, and a couple spirals. And the way the zipper is, it makes the bag less bulky looking on your back. The zipper is also straight so it makes putting things in and taking things out so much easier. I got the rose pattern one and its just so pretty. The pictures online do not do it justice. The water bottle holder is nice and big, its stretchy enough to put not just a water bottle but other things in the pocket as well. And it is waterproof they do have a nice seal on the backpack to prevent water from soaking in. They do have the USB charge port that makes life so much easier when traveling and in public as well can but secured onto you travel size bag as well. The quality is just so nice. Its well worth the price and buy!.

I also really like how it is designed to stay upright when sitting on the floor or any other surface. A lot of book bags tend to lean to the front or back when sitting upright. I also got a lot of compliments on this bag.I highly recommend!!

  I use this bag for my college classes and it‚Äôs perfect for me since I commute. There‚Äôs enough room for my books and notebooks, snacks and drinks and I love the laptop sleeve. My bag has taken some spills but no damage has ever happened to my laptop. I will say they may not be the sturdiest quality, my first bag started tearing at the seam of the strap so I returned it for a new one which was a quick and easy process, but on the replacement one of the zippers came off and I had to snap it back. Overall it‚Äôs a good purchase, but it‚Äôs not superior quality so maybe expect a snafu here or there

  I was looking for something to use as a carry on that also had a luggage pass-through for rolling around the airport between flights. This did the trick and more. Love that it comes with a power port to plug my battery pack into and a water bottle pocket that held my big yeti water bottle snuggly. No worries about it falling as with other backpacks. The sleeve for the laptop is snug, and plenty of room in the inside and outside pockets. Like that it isn't chockablock full of pockets -- sometimes you just need a big pouch to stuff things into rather than squirreling away in a variety of places, only to spend more time rummaging for them when you can't remember where you put what.

  This is a very nice bag, they did almost everything correct. Unfortunately, I will have to return it because the lower & side straps do not match the bag! They‚Äôre beige! It does not blend or match with the colors of the bag at all! So it does not look nice when you wear it on your back as the unmatching straps get exposed beside your arms. Also, the buckles are very low quality. Also, when you hold the bag from the top as a regular bag, the backpack straps hang down loose, there‚Äôs no compartment or pocket to stuff them in. However it‚Äôs a spacious bag and the fabric design is pretty, the makers should‚Äôve used the same fabric for the lower and side strap.

  I am in love with this bag. I received it about a month ago, and so far have had no issues despite daily use. I am a therapist and i need a work bag that can hold my laptop, chargers, headphones, paperwork, workbooks and other materials, as well as snacks for a long day. This bag easily fits everything I need it to, is comfortable to carry, and has kept my laptop dry even in rainy and snowy conditions. I recommend this bag to anyone who needs to carry a lot of things regularly.

  Great backpack, its very spacious but not too bulky. The material is water resistant so when I was walking in the rain to class i didn‚Äôt  have to worry about the rain soaking through the bag material.  Also the material isn‚Äôt super heavy which is a win for me. I love the pattern design and its a good backpack overall. Even my friend was interested in getting one for her self.

  This backpack is awesome!  it is really big Inside but the expandable top design makes it look normal sized.  I‚Äôm using it for a work bag and it fits my laptop, all chargers and accessories, a portable power bank, my lunch, my wallet, a couple bottles of water and it‚Äôs not even half full!  I can‚Äôt wait to take it on a trip and see how it goes. The strap for a spinner will be nice to have. When it first arrived, it was folded in half and it made the shape odd but I loaded it up and hung it on a hook over the weekend and it straightened out on its own. I‚Äôve had so many compliments from women in how cute it is and men on the size and practicality. I‚Äôve seen a few reviews about the strap not lasting but for $30, I‚Äôll just get another one if that happens. Been using this one for about a month and it‚Äôs holding up perfectly!  Use love to see more patterns available.

  I really love this backpack. I originally bought it for my daughter who had an Under Armour Backpack and kept complaining it was too small, so she picked out this one on Amazon. I loved it so much, I stole it from her for my work needs and now I'll order her a new one. It has great storage for my laptop, papers and files and essentials. I have replaced my old rolling briefcase with this backpack as it is  much lighter to lift into my car and my old one was causing tennis elbow problems. I am the owner of a Physical Therapy Clinic and this backpack meets all my needs., Not to mention, it is so cute with the floral patterning. It is not only functional but adorable and stylish at the same time.  Thank you!

  I wanted to give this item 24 hours before I reviewed it. I am an avid traveler and have been in search for a backpack that is both cute AND functional. Typically, I carry my IPad pro, Surface, keyboard, mouse, chargers, water bottle, books, and the occasional switch with me. There is more than enough room in this bag for those items and more. The pockets inside are good for organization and the USB port for a charger is brilliant. I love the fact that there's a way for you to easily slip it over the handle of a suitcase, again, making this product ideal for the average traveler. Quality is thick and doesn't have me worried that my excessive gear will tear it apart. This bag is amazing and one of my best investments.

  So I was super picky when I was looking at bags this was the only one that met all my qualifications  in a bag. The final factor was the rfid pocket which I think is really important to have these days. The vague itself is super spacious with two side pockets for water bottles or umbrellas and such. I was also pretty particular about having those antitheft snaps. It doesn't have a zipper lock but the snaps with definitely make it take longer for someone to steal your laptop. If you picky about it you could probably buy a luggage lock for more protection but i just wanted something that deter or chase theft to take longer than just an old bag. The bag is definitely water resistant and it is both sturdy in frame and in fabric which I was super impressed with. I have no doubt that travel with this bag will be easy and the design is very cute too!

I ran through a storm with my computer in tow and it stayed dry but I also think some water can slip through the zipper if you walk from dorm to classes rather than class to car.Overall great purchase and perfect for multiuse.

  This is by far the best backpack I have ever purchased, it is so spacious!

It's also super cute/fancy looking. I can fit the kids tablets and clothes and my things I would normally put in a purse in here. So many compartments. I love it!!! It is a tad bigger than I expected. But I also didn't look at measurements before buying. Just from the picture I thought it would be a tad smaller. I still absolutely love it!! It's perfect! Very pretty!! It's even prettier in person. This came as described and fast shipping.

  My daughter wanted this bag, so we ordered it for her birthday. The next week our house got hit by a tornado and we had to flee on foot, she had all her things packed in this and we ran several blocks in some of the worse rain I have ever experienced in my life. None of her things got wet. The opening is amazing, we didn't even realize how big it would open on top until we got it. It holds a ton and looks great.

  I bought this backpack recently and I really loved the color! It looks very cute and girly.I was kind of surprised that the bag was sooo huge when I opened it. It has a lot of separate compartments (some with or without zippers). One pocket, which I believe it supposed to be the laptop sleeve, was very nice because there was a lot of padding and a velcro strap to keep it secure in place.I think that even though it looks normal sized, it has the capacity to store so much, especially if one knows how to pack well! It is also really good because of the quality of the material. The backpack is thick and study enough to withhold a lot of weight without the seems ripping (which happened to my old backpack), but it is light enough by itself so that it doesn't feel too heavy to carry.Overall, this is a great bag to use for daily use, since it holds up well!

  I love that it has so many useful features. The pattern is so pretty, the photos do not do it justice.  I've been searching for months for something cute and capable. The top handles have a strap with a snap to secure them while your wearing the backpack.  I was worried about the handles dangling around.  Instead of commuting with my purse, lunch bag and a bag of necessities, I'll be down to one!It has enough space for me to put my entire backpack purse inside and till have room! Padded straps, a nice strong zipper, plenty of pockets. I commute in the train now so this backpack will make it alot easier. The outer pocket unzips to reveal even more pockets and a mesh pocket. There are so  many things I like about thos bag. I plan to purchase another just for traveling.

  This backpack is great! it has a luggage strap so it is perfect for traveling and it‚Äôs also the perfect size for a personal item on an airplane and as a school backpack. I bought the gray with multicolored flowers and blue and green leaves and it is stunning! My only problem is the backpack comes folded in half so it is a little bent until you put your stuff in it.

  I am a nurse and I was looking for a bad that had several pockets and could accommodate all the things that I carry. I am also in school, so if it could serve two purposes even better. When I first started looking, I wasn't looking for a backpack. However I am extremely glad that I happened upon this bag because it is amazing and I love it!! It has several inside pockets, it has a front organizing pocket, side pockets, it even has 2 inside laptop pockets so that you get the perfect fit for the size of your laptop.

    Overall best backpack for school/travel
  
",5.0,N. Milo,"Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was looking for a college backpack that would fit my laptop, binders, big water bottle, and calculator, phone, etc. that I could also use for travel when needed. I am slightly embarrassed to admit that I did a LOT of research on backpacks. I compared many different styles, sizes, brands, etc.. This one met all of my requests and more. The only thing I wish is that it came in other color options than floral. But it easily fits all my college essentials mentioned above with room to spare. It fits my 15 in Chromebook smoothly, with padded protection and my large metal water bottle. The features that set this backpack apart from others is the luggage strap, the front pocket with slots inside (bonus: rfid pocket I plan to use when traveling), the handle on top (makes it so much easier to lug it out of the car), and the extra side pockets on the inside - which honestly get a little bit in the way when I am trying to fit my binders in, but I am glad they are there so I can put my large Mophi for my phone and use the cool charging outlet.Overall, this has saved me at school (I was literally carrying around 2 backpacks before) and I can't wait to use it for traveling. I highly recommend it, if you are okay with floral print.

  Cute bag, loved the pockets inside and out. The strap for putting on a roller board handle is a life saver. However, after only 3 trips the shoulder straps are tearing from their connection points. Would not recommend for heavy travelers, as a laptop and some notebooks were enough to wear it out in less than 3 months.

  Great backpack being used by High School student. Design is attractive and has a multitude of compartments. Can easily fit a large laptop, books, binders, etc. Side pocket can hold a large water bottle. There's also a USB connection allowing for portable charging (you supply your own power bank). The purse-like zipper opening on the top is pretty functional; very wide and allows for easy access to items - a nice break from the traditional backpack designs. Has held up well so far and quality seems excellent. Note the material is not like a fabric, more reminiscent of like an insulated cooler (if that makes sense). This, however, does make it seem really water-resistant which is great protecting your electronics and papers inside. Overall, very pleased with the bag!

  There is no padding in the straps, which defeats the purpose of the bag. I bought this napsack because it was really cute and had great reviews... But I'm disappointed with the bag. It does not distribute weight very well, so a laptop plus my other handbag items feel really heavy. Also the straps look like they're about to fall off soon.

  I am most disappointed that the zipper was busted when I received it but I didn‚Äôt have time to return it. The zipper (even if it wasn‚Äôt broken) is really hard to zip back and forth.

Oh, and I don‚Äôt love that it won‚Äôt stand up when sitting in the floor. It flops forward but that may be because of what I have in it or because of how it was shipped and it‚Äôs broken in yet.

  I got this bag for school this year, it's perfect for a college student like me. It has a little usb plug that you can plug your phone charger to and on the inside you can hook up a portable charger. I tested out the bag by taking it on a family road trip. I practically fit my entire life into this bag. It holds everything, even when I had everything I needed in it I could still fit more in it. My only problem with it is that its a little stiff and uncomfortable, I'm sure I just need to break it in some more, but do with comment as you will.

I had to take some time to get used to the clamshell type opening at the top but now I am fine with it.

  Let me start by saying I love this backpack. It's so stylish and has lots of space for all the stuff I need. I carry my ipad and laptop with me, and the two slots and the velcro securing strip cover them both. Lots of space in the main bag. I also love the idea of the external USB port so you can charge your phone and use it, which is great for traveling. HOWEVER, the external USB port comes unstuck and gets lost easily between the lining and outside of the bag. The staps aren't ergonomic, and become tiresome very quickly, especially if you're carrying a lot of weight (two devices, a water bottle, and a change of clothes plus a walk across campus is just about enough for me). I really wish it had a buckle for across the chest. The zippers stick a bit, but that's easily fixed by rubbing them with a pencil. Overall it's a good backpack, and I'd buy it again.

  First, I love the handles so I can carry it like a bag, and how it opens so I can see everything in my bag without digging, but the wider mouth is a little deceiving. I keep thinking I can put more into the bag but then it won't close. I bought it as a carry on and could fit everything I needed in it until I tried to put my 15'' laptop in it and then it wouldn't close. I had to take stuff out before it would close over my laptop. This bag fits the same amount as my $7 backpack from Aldi, and it is really heavy before putting all my books and electronics inside. It's really nice that it's waterproof and has a luggage strap (which is partly why I bought it), but overall it was a little disappointing since I couldn't fit everything I needed.

  Well pulling it out of the package. I was already excited. The bag is very sturdy. The material is very durable and as described. It has ample amount of space to take with you just about everything. I will be using this bag strictly just for when I travel. I took a few pictures to give me an idea of the space inside. The first picture is the outside the second I was down to my inner elbow with How deep the bag is. It is also it opens up very wide as well. Now there is an iPad pocket and also a laptop pocket. I have the 12.9 in 3rd generation iPad Pro. It will fit in the pocket, but it's not deep enough for it to go down all the way however with my Pro and its case it will properly fit in the laptops lot. So I'm not sure if you could safely store your 15. 6 in laptop In the laptop pocket, maybe in a 14in? Overall I am completely satisfied with my purchase.

  I really love that this bag is cute and functional. The charging port is awesome because I slide my power bank in the inside pocket and my phone can be in the outer side pocket with easy access and its still deep enough to be concealed. I love the front pocket as well because it holds a lot more than I expected. The zipper is sturdy and slides nicely. What I don't like is the straps. They are thinner than I would like and don't stay tight. It is ok for  short trips or for trips where you are not carrying the bag all day. But, I spend two days walking around museums while carrying this bag and it definitely made my shoulders and neck sore. The only other thing I wasn't crazy over is that the fabric on the inside seems cheap. Although it hasn't ripped yet (I've had and used often this bag for a few months) I could see it not holding up if it were being used on a daily basis. Overall, I do like it and think it is a great bag.

  GENERALI was looking for a new backpack to replace an adidas one I have had for years. Now that I am in college, I know I don‚Äôt need to carry as much. I take most of my notes on my iPad or laptop and both fit snuggly in the desired slots. I have a 15‚Äù hp and a 10.5‚Äù iPad. I only got to use it for a week before school went online because of COVID-19, but I have been nannying two kids since then and I continue to use this bag everyday. All the reviews with pictures and the amazon pictures look just how my bag came! It was almost smaller than I thought when I first opened the package, but it‚Äôs capacity is pleasantly large.PROSI can easily fit a large water bottle (40 oz contigo or tal brand both fit) in the side slot. I even can out two kid water bottles on the other side which is great for this summer while I am a nanny. The charging ability is great for my phone and my battery fits easily in a slot on the inside of the main pouch. I have used this bag in the rain a few times, never staying out too long, but I don‚Äôt have to worry about my things getting wet. (HOWEVER- the inside of the drink slots are not waterproof between the water bottle and the inside of the bag, so if your bottle is dripping, it can leak through the fabric into the main pocket) but from the top and outside of the bag, i have not noticed any water getting in.CONSwhat I mentioned above about the inside of the drink pockets is my main con. The only other thing I have really noticed is that the straps are not super comfortable all the time. Being that I have them to their max length and that I have used it a lot with sleeveless shirts, the non-padded parts do rub on my armpits. If I am wearing a t-shirt, I have noticed it is a lot more comfortable but can still dig in a bit if the bag is very heavy.

  The open-top design is amazing! Makes it so much easier to get things out on the bus or at the store without fearing that my things are going to fall out. I also really love the hand-strap option. It's a more professional way to carry a bag for work meetings and events. And unlike regular backpacks, these hand straps are sturdy!I also really like all the pockets and dividers! I was looking at other similar bags, but I didn't like how they didn't have pockets inside to help keep things organized. Which is why I chose this one in the end.I wish there had been more variety in design choices... I got the hydrangea(?) design because I avoid rose designs, but while it's really pretty, it's a little more ""busy"" than I would have liked, especially for work, which is why I need it. I would recommend expanding into more subtle design options... solid black, grays, blues, greens... maybe some faint prints with stripes, dots, chevrons, and things like that to fit a more professional look.Regardless, I do love the bag and I'm really pleased with it!

The bag has tons of pockets, inside and out. I love keeping my ID card holder, sunglasses, chapstick, etc all tucked in pockets because they get lost at the bottom of my bag and there's more than enough room for everything to have a place.

The material is definitely water resistant.  For traveling, the backpack fits perfectly under the seat on the airplane.

  I bought this backpack not thinking I would really need it, but man I‚Äôm glad I had it! Went on 5 flights last week and it was beyond handy to have! Even if you don‚Äôt have a laptop! It made everything convenient. Boarding passes, passport, wallet, etc. I went with a friend you had a different travel backpack and she ended up returning her‚Äôs to get this one! The strap to attach to luggage is a huge bonus while traveling! And the front little pocket I love that it is a zipper not just a magnetic flap, feels more secure! I thought I would only use this for travel but now I use it for work with my laptop. Side note: if you have a 17‚Äù laptop it will fit into the center but won‚Äôt zip up all the way(as shown in photo). Not a lot of people have the giant laptop so I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a huge deal. I have it and still use it because I love the backpack that much!

  I use this bag for work and I have to say it has exceeded my expectations. I saw a few mixed reviews about quality, but the style and setup of storage space was really appealing, so I thought what the heck I'll try it out. I'm glad i did. The material is like a coated canvas, which was a pleasant surprise, it has tons of storage. The doctor bag style opening makes it super easy to take things in and out. I also like that of I have anything over sized I can leave the top open and use the carry handles. The color is stunning, very vibrant. When I got the bag I did note that the box was heavy. I though maybe I got the wrong product; but no, it was right and the bag just has slight heft, which adds to the quality of materials, for me.

  This bag is fantastic!  I get so many compliments.  I work full time, work 2 days a week doing home care and go to school online.  Needless to say, I have to carry ALOT of stuff with me every day.  I have been looking for a single bag that can carry everything I need, and this is it.  It fits my 15.6 in laptop (it's a rather tight fit, but it closes fine and does not impact the rest of the storage capacity of the bag.) It holds my small lunch bag, umbrella, large water bottle, binder, planner and wallet.  The outside pocket is great for makeup, pens, and extras.  The external charger access is great too.  The fact that the top opens wide allows everything to be visible in the bag.  It seems to be holding up well after 3 weeks of heavy loads and daily use, and it has proven to be rain and snow resistant as well.  Plus its very pretty!  Love this bag!

The way it opens at the top is also a plus, you can see all your items like in a tote bag, but you have the added luxury of being able to carry it like a backpack (who wants a heavy bag on one shoulder all day?

Luggage straps are great so you can securely stack your luggage; if you have a carry on suitcase (or any rolling suitcase) you can just pop this bad boy on top (use it as your personal item :p) and it will be secure and ready to rock!

  I've had this for over a month now. I carry it to classes two times a week, very stuffed to the max. Very heavy load. This bag is absolute perfect. I feel like my complaints are so small they're insignificant but I will list them cause it's a short list. First is that the tiny magnetic snap strap to keep the top handles together does fit around both the straps and stay held shut. With some effort I can get it to just barely stay together but any small jolt causes them to come disconnected. Second is that the shoulder straps are a bit narrow for my personal liking. Third is that I would have loved to seen some kind of protective hardware on the bottom like those little metal knobs you see on some luggage- but that's just an opinion. My only concern I had pros to buying the bag was that the waterproof material would feel cheap, either to stiff or to flimsy. That is definitely not the case. Feels sturdy but not brittle stiff feeling. All in all I love this bag. *In the pic I can close the it with my small purse thrown on top on the books and binder*

  As a college senior I usually only carry a few items all around campus (my laptop, chargers, notebook, pens/pencils, and a water bottle). i was using a cute tote before but it was killing my shoulders! this bag was the perfect solution and worth the price for me.It all fits, and the doctor-bag opening was honestly a selling point for me. The structure of the backpack keeps everything in place and avoids that sagging weight that a lot of unstructured backpacks have. It‚Äôs like carrying a comfortable and conveniently sized box on your back, but without looking like you need to be professionally evaluated.I'll try to update this review to see how it lasts after some use. So far, it's a spacious backpack and it holds my 15.6"" laptop with an inch or so to spare. The weight distribution is great! It feels light and I like the spacious side pockets. The material is very smooth and soft,very comfortable to touch.I got this because it looks beautiful ÔºàThe color is the same as the picture, without color differenceÔºâand I would recommend it since it is very fashion and functional.

  Beautiful back pack.  It was too big for me.I would definitely purchase a smaller size if available.

  Absolutely love this bag! The quality is amazing. I love the vibrancy of the flowers. I also love how the bag opens so wide to accommodate all of your stuff and also so you can easily see where things are. Great bag, great price!

  I was looking for a backpack with more storage pockets and this fits the bill. There are interior pockets‚Äî2 with padding for iPads, Kindle, etc.‚Äîand pockets in the outer zipper compartment. It isn‚Äôt really fabric, but more of a waterproof vinyl type material‚Äîgreat for commutes in bad weather. I‚Äôm not sure how long it will hold up under significant wear, but it suits my purpose.
