  We are almost a month in an this far I’m impressed. Unlike some other reviews I find the sound to be spot on. My son is 8 and taking piano lessons. He loves this new piano. The application that offers free lessons quickly converts to a $19.99 monthly charge. With that said he loves it and has progressed much faster using it. The piano incorporates his phone. I think this addition makes it more interesting to children versus the traditional books and lessons.

    Sounds great, cheaply made
  
",3.0 ,Lynn89,"Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2018","









  
  
    
  I took lessons for many years as a child, got older, lost interest and sold my piano.  Fast forward many years and I was looking for a relatively inexpensive way to see if it’s a hobby I’d like to pick up again as an adult, before I made the decision to buy a real piano. Right out of the box I was disappointed because both the piano seat and the stand were broken. The knob that is used to tighten the stool is made out of a cheap plastic that looked like it had been crushed with a hammer. I had the same issue with a couple of the screw/knobs that hold the stand together. I didn’t expect world class quality since this was pretty cheap, but I like the chance to break things myself! We were able to replace the screws to get the stand to work, but gave up on the stool. That being said, I am pleased with the keyboard itself. The sound is clear and keys feel great. The included headphones sound great and are a great addition to the keyboard. This would be a great keyboard for someone with limited space, someone looking to get back into playing or for a child just starting to take lessons.

  Doesn't work with MIDI as I expected. My computer can't even recognize what I'm plugging in and I had to buy a separate cable for another decent bit of money just to test that. And now for some reason, there's a constant buzzing in the background of every note that gets pressed and it's very annoying. This was probably almost not even worth it at all. The keyboard constantly falls backward on the stand. The headphones were also trashed immediately since they're pretty bad.

    Decent Starter Keyboard
  
",3.0 ,JR,"Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2019","









  
  
    
  I've been playing for years and imagined this to be a little bigger than it actually is (I must have had 72 keys on my last keyboard and not realized it). The music rest is flimsy for actual music books and sitting them on there pulls the keyboard stand over backwards, so that's a disadvantage for my purposes. However, it can hold individual sheet music pages and probably an Ipad or Chromebook of you're downloading specific pieces from that (as opposed to an entire book of music). It's easy to put together and very hi-tech, with a guide showing you what all the different buttons can be used for. It also comes with a promotional code for 3 months of free lessons. So all in all it's good for someone who's just learning to play, but if you're already a pro I wouldn't recommend it.***An update just a few days after getting it: I tried to raise the keyboard so I could play it standing up.......it fell over backwards and the flimsy music rest broke off. It didn't detach, it broke. Because the stand is designed with a back leaning angle, once you raise it to a certain height it falls backward. So, not a good keyboard if you ever have a need or want to play standing. And no, I'm not unusually tall, my height is 5'6"".

  The keyboard / electronic piano comes complete with stool and very sturdy stand. An adult should put it together for a child under 8 years --- older could assemble it.It has study guides for piano practice, has a memory card (like in a digital camera) to store music, and has a ""Demo"" mode to give the child some ideas on how it will sound.My grandson loves it. It sat and played (sort of ) on it for about 2 hours on the day (his B-Day) and focused on the unit.  He is 6 and it would be fine for an older child depending on their size. A child over 8 might need to just set the keyboard unit on a desk or table since the stand is height adustable to only a certain size child.You kid(s) won't be disappointed if they like to get into music and look to advance their piano playing.

  The RJ 761 model has the MIDI output to connect to an Android/Apple device or laptop.  In order to play music through learning apps like Simply Piano, Skoove, Playground Sessions, etc. you will need a midi output. The midi cord is not included but can be purchased separately according to whether you are connecting to an Android device, iPad/iPhone or laptop.The first keyboard we purchased from another vendor did not have a MIDI output so we returned it. Our 9 y/o son is a beginner and we wanted him to be able to use learning apps like Simply Piano, etc.There's also an aux input port to play music from your phone or mobile device, through your keyboard.He loves it.

  Easy to set up, lightweight, and the press of the keys are similar enough to a piano but I’ve yet to encounter a keyboard that %100 mimics the keys and sound of a grand piano. The tone is good enough for teaching and practicing, the sheet music stand is incredibly flimsy like.... it bends... horribly but I enjoyed the ease of setup and it’s a good deal for the products. The keys when pressed do NOT stutter and repeat like some other competitors and I’m incredibly glad for that. It came early and safely, it was well packaged and I’m very happy.

  My 11 year old daughter loves this keyboard! The only complaints are that the piano sound setting doesn't really sound like a piano. The record feature only lasts for about 30 seconds. So if you want to record an actual song it isn't long enough for that. Great for beginners but will eventually need to be upgraded if your child really wants to explore the creating their own beats and songs.

  This is pretty good for a young child. The sound is not the greatest, and sounds like a high end toy. The letters on the stickers began to wear off after two weeks.

  Three years ago, I purchased a different digital keyboard that was fifty dollars cheaper than this one. Over all, I would rate my previous experience with the other keyboard as positive. With the other keyboard, the piano sounds were pleasant and even though not nearly as good as a pricier model that is musician quality, the sounds were fairly convincing. Additionally, with the cheaper keyboard, there was a decent selection of pre-programmed songs and the tutorial section was fairly well done and fun to use.I can say none of those things about the Rockjam RJ761. The worst part of this particular keyboard is the sound quality. The Grand Piano, for example, is totally synthetic and is not in any way, convincing. It sounds plastic and cheap. Furthermore, the tutorial section is basically useless and the selection of songs you can learn with it is lacking and uninspiring. To make matters worse, the action on the keys is horrific. I cannot think of a single good thing to say about this product. Not one single positive thing to say about it.When I bought  the Rockjam, I didn't have very high expectations. I knew that I wasn't buying a professional grade instrument, but I made the mistake of assuming that since I was spending fifty dollars more than what I spent the last time I bought a digital keyboard, that it would be better than the one I bought before.It wasn't better. Not in any way, shape or form. I cannot think of any circumstance in which someone should even consider purchasing this product. Not even for a young child. For the quality you are getting, you would be much better served buying a much cheaper model. At least that way, even if the cheaper model isn't very good, you won't have spent the extra money to get garbage.

  For the price and for a beginner, it is perfect. Set it at a height that is perfect for my 5 year old. She has practiced almost everyday for a few months now and has moved on to songs. So it is serving its purpose very well. BUT, and unless there are settings I haven't figured out, you don't get any of the key-tap-sound-sensitivity like you would on a higher end piano keyboard. To play real songs, you are missing 40% of the experience and that is the volume of the ringing dependent on how hard or soft you hit a key. So imagine a robot singing monotone compared to a human singing the same song. it's like that. I tried playing Yiruma- The river flows in you on it like I do on a real piano and wow, same notes, same person playing, but on this keyboard, the song is unrecognizable. So just know what you are buying.

  I am a beginner and was excite to learn how to play the piano.  The keyboard was easy to set up, the chair is comfortable.  Once i plug in, there's an interference with radio frequency playing in the background.  I tried difference outlets in the house, away from antenna and cell phones, nothing worked.  The background noise was distraction for me to learn.  I've googled and looked around in the reviews, it doesn't appear to be a common problem for most.  I even called Amazon support, no one was able to solve the problem.

  While the keys do work and the variety of sounds and styles are nice. My biggest problem is that the keyboard is somehow not in right key/pitch. The middle C sounds way too high than average and when I move down the the first C it is way too low to use. I’m fairly disappointed with this, no matter the brand or piano. Middle C should sound the same through out. For the time being, before I invest into a higher quality piano, I will use it to practice via muscle memory than sound.

  I’ve never owned a keyboard so I don’t have anything else to compare this to but from what I have seen with this keyboard it’s very simple to learn to use right out of the box. I’ve already learned several simple tunes through Simple Piano. My teenage children who’ve never shown interest in learning an instrument like to sit down at this keyboard and play. I think it’s greta to have in the house for th family. I’ve always wanted to learn to play piano and the violin since a child and now as an adult I’ve given myself the joy of learning to play an instrument. It’s a great hobby and very soothing after a long hard day at work.

  I bought this piano for my kids and myself to learn to play.  We just received the package today.  I set it up properly, and within a few hours of me playing on it, the power started glitching out and eventually turning off completely.  It would turn back on, only to glitch again 5 mins later and turning off.  Very frustrating when you're in the middle of practicing.  I then moved it to a different outlet in another room, hoping it was just faulty.  Same problem.  I even then attempted batteries to which I still had the same problem.I am hoping maybe this was just a faulty one out of the batch, but it was really discouraging and disappointing.  Especially since me and the kids have eagerly been waiting on its arrival.  Other than that, it is the perfect size for my 10 year old.  My 5 year old struggles a little bit on the piano but that's mostly just due to his age and little fingers.  He also has no experience playing.The sound quality was fine.  But my ears aren't tuned to fine piano-ing since I'm just a beginner.  I haven't really tried out the headset at this point.  And I haven't reached out to customer service since it is so late at night. Hopefully I can get it resolved or just buy a more expensive piano after returning it.

  I'm gonna write an honestly review. I battled with the idea of owning a piano for a few years after getting my house. The house is a split floor plan and no matter how hard we planned, it made no sense to bring a piano up a flight of stairs to the living room or down a flight of stairs to the den. We chose this keyboard and it's light weight, portable and sounds great! I absolutely love it. I have no desire to ever own the real piano after getting this keyboard. The best is I can move it up and down the stairs with no issues. I don't even the free piano lessons, I like to just youtube songs. And I don't think all the buttons are easy to use. But overall my entire family has been enjoying this keyboard. I recommend!

  Piano has too many features for me! So cool. Teaching myself piano is fun on this keyboard. I have thin walls, so I plug in my own headphones and the neighbors are saved from my annoying plunking and botched practice songs. Stable stand, great keyboard. I don't use the bench seat and I place the unit next to the wall as the music stand is not durable. And the headphones are cute, and work well, but hurt greatly after 45 mins of practice. I ordered a micro USB to Midi adapter and with my various free apps, I'm able to connect piano to program and learn even faster.Haven't tried their free piano classes. Looked like a hassle.

  It's a relatively cheap keyboard, and the speakers can't handle the volume higher than 4 when you press more than a couple keys at once. It's also not weighted so you can't adjust the volume of a note by pressing it harder or softer.That being said, I think it's great for beginners, both kids and adults. We have an 8yo who wanted to learn how to play, but good keyboards are expensive. This is perfect for her to learn on and we can get a better one when she outgrows it. Overall it's a good value if you're wanting to learn, but it just doesn't cut it for intermediate or advanced players.

  I bought the Rockstar for my son to take Piano Class in school. He really likes it and I really like the fact that it came with headphones so he can do class, practice and i can't hear it. I would have given it a five except when unboxing and setup; i realized the company seller/company did not supply enough 5x40 thumb screws that the directions was calling for to complete the setup to attach the keyboard to the stand. However the sound quality so far is great for what it going to be used for.

Not for someone who plays professionally but it is great to teach on or just play because you love it. The stand is not too sturdy, but fine for people who don’t have jumping cats or dogs or kids who don’t have manners lol. Stool is great. Everything was nice except for the head phones which only one ear piece works... don’t waste money on something more unless you want a professional keyboard.

  Bare-bones assessment: Not a good starter instrumentWhy?-Keys are particularly hard to press for a starter keyboard (as compared to other similar models)-Keys are not pressure sensitive (about 1/3 way through the press, you get a full-volume tone no-matter how soft you press)-No option for addition of a sustain pedal (usually sold separately)DON'T GET FOOLED BY THE BAIT AND SWITCH!The model has changed or the company is fraudulently using reviews from another model. In either case, it is unlawful to use reviews in advertising which do not reflect the product being offered. I carefully read the reviews and two of them confirmed that it had a jack to allow the addition of a pedal. The unit I was sent did not have the input jack on the back, so it can not be added. I consider this a very important feature.

  We purchased this for my 14 year old son who wants to learn piano as an early Christmas gift. We set it up and he played on it for about 30 mins that night before turning it off. He got up the next morning and went to try and play and every 5-6 notes he would press it would make a high pitched squeal noise (even when playing on the low keys).  We tried turning it off, unplugging it for a bit and trying again but it still was make the horrible noise. Emailed RockJam the manufacturer and received an email back stating that the retailer would need to handle the return. Contacted Amazon and after the Amazon rep tried to contact the company but with no luck, she just refunded my money and UPS will be picking up the Keyboard tomorrow to ship back to Amazon. The keyboard itself was really nice when it worked, and the stand and stool were decent as well, but the lack of customer service from the manufacturer is very disheartening. Purchase at your own risk.

  When I was young I was given a keyboard and loved it so much that I learned to play piano, later buying myself a full upright that I still play every day. As my son shares many of my interests, I bought this keyboard for his 10th birthday last August. At first he liked to play ""guess the instrument"" with me, by configuring the settings and pressing a key. (A difficult thing to guess, because like all keyboards, the sound of a violin or clarinet is not entirely accurate.)  It's been about six months now and he loves the keyboard more than ever. Now he plays fluidly with both hands, and I'm impressed by how well the keyboard handles simultaneous keys. He has learned to configure the keyboard in a way that he can play a different ""instrument"" for treble or bass sections simultaneously. Even if he never makes a lifelong hobby of it, I feel that my investment in this keyboard has paid off with the sheer amount of time he's spent on it. All at his own discretion, too!

  The keyboard in question was rather nice and it has some excellent settings on it to really get one into the art of finger dancing. However, my headphones that I got with it went out in one ear on the second day of use and the keyboard is rather light, so it's easy to push over, so I've had to add weights on the end. The electronic interface has some issues in respects of the notes are just slightly above where the should be at multiple angles, so learners may have to rewire their brain to try and figure out the differences between an A note and B note positioned on the scale. Overall nice sound quality, though.

  Great keyboard piano for little ones to explore their musical interests. My only reason for not giving it a perfect score is the fact that the volume goes from 1 to 20, and resets to 10 (half power) every time you turn it on.  How many of your other electronic devices  don't recall the settings from a prior session?  Nothing like having to remind (holler at) the kiddo every time they turn this toy on.

  I debated getting this for quite a while.  After all my son is only two so why would I spend so much?  But then I looked at toddler keyboards and they were $50...I might as well get something that will grow with him for twice the amount.  I love this thing.  He figured it out immediately and even started learning simple songs.  There are tons of features I will likely never learn.  The only thing I'm not a fan of is everytime it turns on it starts at a really high volume.  The volume is adjustable but the increments are not linear so I have to keep it on the lowest setting (which is still pretty loud).  He's learning so much, I am really happy I got it.  As he grows I'm sure we'll try out other features.  Setup was really easy, too!

  Awesome product at a nice price. The only complaint I have with the keyboard itself is the little tiny screws included did nothing to hold the stand together. We replaced them with bigger screws, problem solved! My little guy thinks this is the best thing since Minions. The sound is good, has big keys to give a ""real piano"" feel. It has several tones, rhythm and percussion options, along with some nice demo songs. Headphones are a plus! Overall, this looks decent, feels nice, and plays rather well. Maybe not for a ""professional"", but perfect for my little guy to learn on. It even looks cool enough that the older guys like playing with it. The only disappointment lay not in the piano, but in the bonuses. The included Joytunes app is ONLY for Ipad. The extra Skoove membership is ONLY for PC. There is no MIDI on the keyboard, but I didn't expect one for the price. Oh, and the volume resets every time you turn it on, which can be surprising.

  The keyboard sound is now on high and you can't lower it.  Nor can my grandson use headphones because of the loud sound.  He was not abusive to the keyboard.  It just stopped working and it is too late for Amazon to do anything about it.  Very disapppointed with the product and would not recommend it.  I am waiting for a response from the company, but since they are in the UK and would probably have to pay for shipping it seem unlikely I will get the fixed and therefore have to buy a new one.

  The stand was a main reason I got this package rather than just a keyboard. I have a very small house and it's easier to have it on the stand as opposed to finding a place to store it. The stand came without the screw-holes so I couldn't even set it up. I've contacted the company and they asked for proof of purchase and it's been 5+ weeks since I even heard back. If I could send it back, I would but I recycled the box the same week I got it so I could store it. I didn't find out the stand wasn't usable until I went to set it up.

  Had not played a keyboard in several years and wanted to reconnect with this outlet, but noticed right away that this keyboard sounded tinny and had an awkward ringing sound after the keys were struck while in the basic piano mode. The keyboard I had as a 10 year old sounded better even after all these years (confirmed via FaceTime). I wish I had taken a video/audio to share.  I returned this one and bought a basic Yamaha from Guitar center and instantly I started to play songs from my piano lessons so long ago, because it sounded closer to the real thing.

  Great deal! I set this up and my kids were drawn to it like a magnet. I think you get so much for the money. I love that it had headphones so that practices are quiet. My only complaint is that it auto defaults to the volume setting on max high, which I need to correct so my kids don’t blow out their eardrums.

  You get what you pay for... this is a very low quality keyboard. It feels cheap and looks cheap. There is a horrible buzzing noise coming from the speakers that sometimes goes away when you slap the back of the piano. Headphones fell apart and sound terrible. The stand is not sturdy and wobbles while you play. Keys sometimes don't even sound when you press them. And overall this keyboard just does not sound good. The only good thing about it is it comes with a stool. I would recommend investing in a better keyboard. This is more like a cheap toy.

  At first I was hesitant to purchase this piano because I thought it would be too small for me.  But, to my surprise, it works well with me and my grandchildren.  I'm the beginner with the piano; they are teaching me to play and I'm enjoying every minute of it.  They love this piano so much that they will drop their instruments (flute and clarinet) to practice with me.  The headset is great because it allows you to practice quietly.

  With the exception of FedEx leaving the box in the lobby of my 19 floor, 11 apt per floor building in the original marked box, on Christmas Eve without attempting delivery, the keyboard is amazing. The stand requires 5 minutes of assembly and it is completely adjustable. The headphones are not loud at all, but I purchased this for my 8 year old daughter and it is by far her favorite gift. The keyboard is perfect for her beginning fingers and I am very happy with my purchase. The adsituonal lessons and PianoMaestro app that was included is an amazing perk. This product definitely exceeds the price.  I suggest that FedEx be cut out of the deal. They almost ruined this review.Sn: The box was also damaged in the delivery. I could put two fingers inside of the closed box and feel the keys. This may be the cause of so many bad reviews. See photo.

  I thought I would take a chance with this product because there were some good reviews and the price was right at 99 for piano chair n stand.  Package was delivered a mess and looked like it was dragged through town but we opened packaged anyways hoping it was well packaged internally without damage to the product itself however, like others mentioned there were crooked keys  and cracks in the keys and when playing along with the app it didn’t pick up the D note at times.  I really really wanted to keep this since it was such a great deal and for my toddler.  So disappointed we will have to return and keep looking. On a good note the seat was comfortable and the stand worked well and was sturdy.  If u are lucky to get a good piano then this wouldve been a great set. I wanted to add customer service was wonderful to work with. Returning the item was easy with at home pickup.  I would’ve been even more upset if I had to lug it back myself.

  Great starter piano. I have 3 little ones and I wanted to expose them to music but also not spend a lot of money on something they could tear up. The fact that it comes with a stand, stool, piano and HEADPHONES is a major plus. It also comes with stickable notes that can be placed on the keys to help with learning. Within a day of having the piano my 7 and 4 year old were both able to play ""twinkle twinkle little star"" just by me calling out the notes to them. It's the perfect height for both adults and kids. My 3 year old often hops on there and attempts to play which is why the headphones are absolutely wonderful. The only and I mean only issue i have is the volume is automatically set to the highest level upon turning the keyboard on. I feel it's a little much especially when the kids have on headphones. Sometimes the little ones don't turn it down and that causes me some concern for their hearing but other than that it's a solid product that even my munchies haven't been able to destroy. It's a great bundle. If I could make a suggestion maybe a booklet with a few basic songs such as twinkle twinkle, Happy Birthday etc would be a great addition.

  So this is only the second-ever item in about a decade I've had to return on Amazon because of how unfortunately broken it was. I am completely clueless why it doesn't work, but today was literally my first day of owning it, and I played on it for ~1 hour. In that time, there were multiple instances of the volume turning all the way up and down for no discernable reason AND it was alternating between all of the different instruments for no discernable reason. Sometimes both would even happen, meaning I would be playing at a low volume, and then for no reason, BAM, super loud and suddenly the sounds of drums and cymbals.It appears this is an unusual problem because I can find no troubleshooting on it, but honestly, it was a super easy return decision for me.

She is getting fairly good with her lessons and she has enjoyed having this to practice on. Of course her teacher suggested a keyboard that had keys that bounced back like a real piano, but those are not cheap. For the price, this is probably one of the best you can get. We also bought her a foot pedal to learn with as well and it easily plugged into the back and works nicely. It has lots of other fun features to play with.

  You won't like playing it. You won't want to record with it. It's mediocre, but it's cheap and has all the parts. Yes, you actually get everything you need to play in one box. Just plug it in. You can buy one of these and stick it somewhere just to punch notes. It's not good enough to be temporary-permanent or permanent-temporary. It's a cheap, temporary solution. Period.

She sat right down and started learning how to play by using an app (I think it's called Simple Piano).  The stickers to label the keys are helpful.  She is thrilled with this and it sounds great.

  I bought this because I wanted to learn the piano but before I made a huge investment I wanted to make sure I would stick with it. I've been practicing using YouTube videos and studying music theory on my own. I practice every day since I've had it and it has good Stone quality. I've already learned a few songs. I used stickers to label the keys but I'm also learning them. Very affordable for a beginner or just someone who wants to have fun but has minimal space. I would absolutely recommend it.

  Nice array of sounds to choose from, but the regular piano sound isn’t great. Keys are all on/off  so you can’t control the volume of the note by how hard you press the key. Decent weight to the keys, but a bit too much lateral play in their motion. Maybe this is standard for lower end keyboards, but I was disappointed by it. Speakers don’t handle the lower pitches as well as the higher ones. The record feature doesn’t let you play on top of a recording so don’t expect to be able to do any sort of multi track work.

  You get what you pay for. When it first arrived a lot of keys weren’t working so I had to take the whole thing apart and fix it manually and after I did that I gotta say It’s ok if you’re just starting piano and if you need something to learn beginner songs with but the keys don’t sustain notes for more than 2 seconds so once you getting into learning songs with more than half notes it becomes useless. It does come with some cool features but I think it’s better to buy a better piano for more money

    Keys are different than a real piano
  
",3.0 ,Ariella Vaccarino,"Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  Please be aware that the actual keys on this keyboard are smaller than a regular piano key.  Also, the keys are not weighted.  It is good for young players to work with weighted keys because they are similar to a real piano, these keys have a much softer push and will not develop the hand muscles in the same way.  So if you are looking to start of a young piano player before you commit to purchasing a real piano, try and find a keyboard that has the weighted keys.

  If I could give it zero stars I would - I was excited about the low price but the first one we received had a broken key (the key was snapped off). Had to package the WHOLE THING (break down the seat, the stand - everything) back up and send it back for a replacement. When the replacement arrived we set it up - multiple keys wouldn’t even work when pressed. Now having to package up and send back once again! This time not even bothering with a replacement, two defective products and hauling a 30 lb item to the UPS store twice in three days is definitely not worth the savings on this item.

Secondly, it broke. Eight months in and the power supply is shot, not simply the cable. It turns on for a half second, off for three, on for a half second, repeat. What a waste of money.

  I can’t believe how cheap this was for what you get!! Set up was incredibly quick and easy, it sounds great and looks great!! It’s not flimsy nor cheap looking. The chair is sturdy for my 7 year olds and even for me. My kids have no idea to play piano so it’s all just for fun, even so...I think it could be used for more serious play. A lot of buttons and functions we will probably never use, but for the more advance players there are a lot of options. I like how it came with stickers to put on the keys to help them learn. Unfortunately, it does not come with any booklet that will show them how to play some simple songs. There is an app that they suggest to help them learn, but it’s $180 per year.

  After reading all the reviews, I unpacked this immediately upon arrival, plugged it in, and tested each key. Sure enough, when I hit the lowest D key all I heard was a hollow ""click"" sound. This was enough to go back to my desk and initiate a return to Amazon. Without replacement.I also noted that the instrument ""sounds"" did not resemble their labels much, and ""Flute"" sounded much like a ""Concert Grand"". The overall feel of the keyboard is cheap and somewhat fragile. The keys had an odd, mechanical feel. I didn't bother to assemble the stand, of course, but all of the parts were in the box. The stool was actually quite nice.This gets only one star because the broken key makes it useless to us and I'm not willing to gamble the time on a replacement. Even though this is for a twelve year old, he deserves a working instrument!

  My daughter wanted one in her room.  She’s 10 and is just starting to figure out what interests her so we thought this would be a good price-point and size to start with.  She’s enjoyed it and we’ve enjoyed hearing her experiment on her own when she doesn’t want my help.  I on the other hand DO NOT like playing it AT ALL.  I’m used to weighted, touch-sensitive keys and a sturdy stand. We knew they were not touch sensitive but the keys just feel like thin plastic keys that clank loudly when played the way I’m accustomed to and the whole thing wants to rock back and forth.  She’s still a bit timid, lighter-handed and so it doesn’t seem to bother her much.  This has been a good start to see how interested she is but we will probably get her a more recognized brand within the year and pass this one on to another family in the same boat who is also gauging their child’s interest.

  The only purpose this would have is for a child, but only if you believe your child won't ever learn to actually play. If you want to learn, bite the bullet and buy a keyboard that has ""FULLY"" weighted keys, you can find a reasonably cheap one that will last longer and allow you to genuinely feel like you're playing something. Trust me, i get it, they're expensive and it'd seem a lot less troublesome to get this then transition or whatever, no. It is not, this keyboard was a waste of $150 and i finally sold it for like $55 that i had to bargon just to get rid of without having to scam someone. This keyboard is hollow, nothing close to anything real, except maybe like half the size of a real one, but even then it's just a large toy. I gave up trying to learn from it after a week or two because as much as you try to pretend, it will never be the same if you've ever touched a piano. I ended up getting a $900 weighted keyboard for $550, great deal, plays amazing and i absolutely love it. Go to a music store and make a deal with the manager, don't buy something from amazon... it's not a guitar.... It is not the same... Trust me or suffer a piece of crap, i didn't trust the comments when i bought this..

Today the power completely cut out on it. At first just no sound, but now it’s not working at all anywhere in the house.

  Im a total beginner so this is fine for me, but honestly for what I spent I should have just spent the extra thirty dollars on a good Yamaha keyboard. This one has no realistic piano sound and the stand only works because it's leaning against my wall. The keys and all of it are pretty cheaply made and I'm pretty sure this will probably break before i grow out of it and get a new one.

  This is my first keyboard. I’m writing a review two years after ordering this product. It still works the same from the very moment it came in the mail! I’ve practiced so much on it that I am now ready for a more sophisticated keyboard. Highly recommend for beginners even though the sound isn’t as sound or clear compared to more expensive name brand keyboards. My headphone jack broke almost instantly though but my playing doesn’t bother anyone so to me it’s not a huge deal.

",1.0 ,LHM,"Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  I wouldn't even pay $50 for this keyboard now that I know how terrible it is. Here are some of the issues:1. The key action is terrible to the point of being unhealthy. It actively pushes up against you even after the notes have been depressed, so just holding a chord down is tiring.2. When your hand has to move forward on the keys, they're almost impossible to push down. They might as well not have the back inch of the keys.3. The regular piano sound has a built-in reverb which basically just means the sound doesn't stop until half a second after the key is released, so you have no control over the articulation.4. The keys are incredibly cheap. They wiggle from side to side so the keys will rub and scrape each other, and they're also very very noisy when played.

    Great Keyboard But Here Are Some Things To Consider
  
",5.0 ,BookLoverM,"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this as a Christmas gift for my 13-yr-old and have been very happy!  I'd like to point out some things that I think might be helpful for those considering buying it:1) The picture on Amazon is a little misleading. At first glance, it looks as if there is a large display on the top of the keyboard showing the piano learning application/notes to be played. If you look closer, you'll realize it's a tablet sitting on the top of the keyboard, showing the app. The ""display"" feature mentioned in the product description is a small display directly above the keyboard.  Obviously, the piano doesn't come with a tablet included. I knew this when I purchased the keyboard but I think it's worth pointing out. My kid has used his iphone propped on top of the keyboard to play the application so he can learn piano. It works okay. The notes can be a little hard to see at times, but it's not that bad. If you use your tablet to run a piano lesson application, it would be a lot easier probably but using the phone is still doable.2) This set comes with earphones. This is great! However, be aware that the ""Simply Piano"" application requires NO headphones because it has to ""listen"" to the piano being played to advance to the next level or lesson. I don't know if all of the piano apps require this but I didn't think about it when I purchased the keyboard. My kid can use the headphones when he's goofing around on the keyboard, but whenever he wants to use the app to learn, he has to use it without headphones. (I hear him play and practice, which is both a fun upside and a noisy downside. lol)3) There are A LOT of buttons so the keyboard looks very complicated. I think this keyboard is a great buy for beginners interested in learning piano. My kid has really enjoyed it. There are a lot of features & functions. It's a little intimidating at first glance, but most of it is pretty intuitive. There are record & play back functions to play back what you've been playing, which my kid really likes. The are buttons to change the sound/instrument or rhythm. I didn't see any point in overwhelming my kid by going through every description of every button in the manual, but he's had fun exploring & figuring out what each button does on his own.4) What I love most about this keyboard is how much fun he has been having with music. The ""Simply Piano"" application has been good and the keyboard itself has been exactly what I wanted. In my opinion it's a very good value at this price if you're interested in learning to play the piano/keyboard.

  This keyboard is just ok. I bought it for an adult beginner piano and after just a few months, I am already over it. It kind of has a weird sound sound to it. The keys also have no sustaining power unless you switch to a different tone and NONE of those sound good at all. It’s ok if a kid wants to tinker around with learning the piano. I will be replacing it very soon though!

He already knows how to play a guitar, various wind instruments and can read music so it wasn't much of a stretch.  The best thing a parent can hear from a 16 year old is, ""Mom Thanks for getting me the keyboard.  I love it and have already learned how to play a few songs.""  Warms my heart.

I soon realized the blue LED screen is supposed to stay on indicating that power is working. We read the manual too and followed the simple steps but the crap didn’t stay on.

  Unfortunately, the top bar for the stand was missing and when I requested that the manufacturer send this (likely very inexpensive given the cost of the rest of the product) part to me I was told by customer service that I'd have to purchase the part. In other words, I purchased a product in good faith and then, after I had to give my child a gift that was not quite complete, I was expected to pay extra for the manufacturer's mistake. I'm very disappointed because I bought this for someone else who really enjoyed it so was excited to give it to my child.

  My youngest wanted to learn the piano, so we looked for an inexpensive option in case he lost interest.  I talked to a piano player I work with and he said this would work.  I could not agree more.  The bench and stand are great, and easy to put together.  the piano is light and easy to move, and small enough to fit in a corner.  The headphones are comfortable for the kids, not bad for me either.  It does come with piano key stickers, which are a must for me as  I learn to play and teach my kids.  One of the best things is the 3 month app that comes with the piano.  I showed it to the music teacher I work with and she was impressed.The main point of my review is that I am very happy.  Once my kids are better, I will up grade, but for learning this is great.

  Product works and sounds fine, shipping was terrible. We opened the box today to assemble the stand and piano for Christmas and discovered that the keyboard has a giant crack in it. Most likely due to the too large of a box it was shipped in that allowed it to shift and move too much in transit. Disappointed my kid will recieve a damaged present on Christmas morning, but she’ll like it enough. At least it’s still working as far as we can tell.

  This is the second and keyboard I have bought and I couldn't be happier with it (the first one I got from Target and it broke very soon after). My boys love it too. I bought it for my older son, but the little one wants to practice playing too all the time. Plus, the price is right! The warranty was priced well too. We have had and used for about a month.

  Well, where do I start?I ordered this early so that it could arrive in due time with “no rush” shipping. It arrived, I opened it to ensure all the pieces were there & then I wrapped it back up and gift wrapped it, as it was intended as a Christmas gift. We opened the gifts in the Early part of December, and lo-and-behold the left 5 keys don’t work. No sound. Nothing. In anyway. So we go to see about sending it back and now we “can’t” because we had it too long.The actually quality is only partly decent and is not a “full keyboard” if you’re looking to utilize this as a replacement for piano.The accompanied sounds have no similar qualities to actual instruments, as we tested them Cello to Cello, Violin to Violin, guitar to Guitar, and some others. It reminds me very much of a cheap keyboard from the 90s that has horrible sound.The “free” learning app is NOT free.I’d avoid this. Honestly. Not even because it doesn’t actually work. Not because we surpassed return time. But because for the price, you’re better off getting something cheaper that comes with less and yet retains amazing quality.

  this product was a major let down. My daughter had worked hard to earn this as a reward during the quarantine. Once it finally arrived after prioritized shipping (nearly two weeks of prime shipping) the product did not work. after assembling all of the components (stand, stool, etc...) we plugged in the piano and the power light came on, but no sound happened when you tried to play a key. I attempted to change the type of key set and nothing happened. After unplugging and re-plugging from the back of the piano unit then the power on the display appeared, but no sound still, no functionality, nothing. unplugged from wall, and now just power light.I am attempting to get a replacement for the unit because of all the good reviews and the price-point, and hope this was a fluke.

It’s very easy to play, no sticky or broken keys, the stand works great and we have not had any of the problems others described. It was very easy to set up and the app is such a wonderful added bonus! My daughter has several high quality headphones so I didn’t care whether the included ones were useable or not but they are actually quite good, too. This is the perfect keyboard for beginners and, with all of the included extras, it is really a great deal. I would absolutely recommend it to others.

  I bought this for my 5.5 year old for piano lessons.  I didn’t want to invest in a full size piano until I knew he wanted to do it for the long term.  Now, 10 months later, he’s doing great.  So great that his piano teacher says I need to get him a larger keyboard with sensitive keys and a foot pedal.  I can buy one by this same company on Amazon for around $150... of course, if I had known this last year, I would have just paid the $30 more for a significantly better model.

I’ve used the normal speakers about 6 times on level 1 master volume and the left speaker has already blown or has never worked. I had emailed the sending company (I think) and have yet to receive an email back. I would recommend spending the extra few hundred dollars on a different brand.

    This keyboard makes relearning the piano so much fun!
  
",5.0 ,Jeri C.,"Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have not touched a keyboard in many, many years and I wasn't great back in the day, but this keyboard and a good ""how to"" book has me on the way to playing again.  The multiple features on it allow you so many tones it is amazing.  The basic piano tone is fine.  The keys seem a little firm and I have had some trouble with playing unintended double notes but assume with practice that will stop.  I absolutely think this keyboard is a great instrument and for the price it is bringing me a lot of joy.  I tried a Kalimba and a Recorder and they just left me frustrated as I could not really play music, but now I can.

  I give this piano a 3/5. It had endless different types of tone options, but none of them sounded particularly right. If you are a very very new player and are looking for something cheap, I still probably would avoid this. Save up a little more and get one in the $300-$400 range, trust me it's worth it. This piano didn't sound very piano-like, it played the notes but there was no depth behind it. Holding down a note it only plays for a few seconds then completely cuts out, completely unlike an actual piano which would keep the note going. Unless you are brand new, or are getting it for a kid to learn, I would go the next tier up in pricing, you just won't find the quality here

Great product,  great sound,  excellent learning tool in this covid-19 world..Some of the songs in the first few lessons are quite fast.  I do believe having slower songs first will help with learning the notes faster and then increase the tempo as one becomes proficient.  But it's great nonetheless.

  I bought this a couple years ago for my kids for Christmas, and they think it is great fun.  They are old enough now that they've started proper lessons, and this is a nice keyboard for beginners. They love playing it, the stand is durable and it has some neat features. I like that we can plug headphones into it so the rest of the household doesn't have to hear every practice session. Had a minor technical glitch with it, contacted RockJam directly and their customer service was above and beyond what I'd expect.

  I originally bought this just for the keyboard and all the different tones. I really love that there is a training program showing what keys to press to play along. The sound is a bit off compared to my old keyboard, but the old one only had a grand piano so it's difficult and unfair to compare the two. On a side note while I am playing I really don`t notice the sound quality; it sounds good when I am having fun. Same thing goes for the stand wobble. Overall, a decent starting keyboard, but I will definitely need to upgrade if I want to make music for others to enjoy on youtube/cd(lol)/etc.Cons:There is no midi/usb out for connecting directly to GarageBandThe stand is very wobbly when playingI was expecting more diverse sounding tones, but then I found the percussion settings and that alleviated some of my tension.

  It depends what you are looking for in a keyboard. If you are an adult and professional then this isn't it. It was perfect for what I needed it for, which was my 4 year old daughter. She wants piano classes and I live in an apartment. So, this is a good way to see if she will stick with it.I gave it 3 stars because: The chair is decent. The keyboard is cheap plastic, but has a lot of functions. The headphones are decent. My biggest issue is the stand. It is so light and cheap. The keyboard is a bit top heavy and the stand design tries to account for that but doesn't succeed. My daughter already tipped it over 3 times and I've had it a day. So, I need to find a way to anchor it to the wall.

  This product had a lot of good reviews, and I could see how someone who is unfamiliar with the piano would like this product, but the sound quality is cheap and the keys are hard to play. I know I could have spent more to get a more professional sounding keyboard, but so many of the reviews said that this was high quality for a low price. The keys are not weighted like I previously thought, and read before purchasing, and it sounds cheap. I was excited about buying this at first, but now I hardly touch it because of the low quality sound and difficulty playing unweighted keys. Do not buy this product if you are a professional or experienced piano player.

  Overall really dissatisfied with this keyboard.Pros:-Cheap-Comes with a lot for the price-It at least functions as a keyboard. Wasn't dead on arrival.Cons:-Sounds horrible. The voice quality is distorted and tinny, and although there's a lot of them i could count on one hand the amount of halfway decent ones.-The build quality is mediocre at best. The keys feel cheap and plastic-y, and they make a louder sound than the tones themselves. I cannot overstate how bad the keys are. They feel really awful. The stand feels like it could fall over at any time, and the stool is not adjustable at all.-The headphones are BEYOND cheap build quality, but that's too be expected.-The USB midi functionality is downright ABYSMAL. When plugged into my pc and using FL Keys in FL Studio 20, there was a whole half second delay between when I hit the key and when the sound played. This essentially made using it as a midi controller completely out of the question.Overall I can't recommend this keyboard for anyone other than young children who won't know the difference. Will absolutely be returning this and getting something from a more trusted brand.

So I had to go look online to see pictures of it assembled.When the keyboard is mounted on the stand in its tallest position the keyboard is so top heavy it keeps falling forward. I had to keep my foot on the stand to keep it from falling over.When I turned it on nothing worked. Red is on and blue is off. When I press the buttons there is no feedback to wether it recognizes the button push. After unplugging it and plugging it back in it worked better.If it was for me I would prefer the older buttons.

  Obviously you get what you pay for and I didn't expect a whole lot, but it really isn't worth the money.  Stand is incredibly unstable.  Even against a wall it wobbles so much as to be unusable.

  I bought this keyboard ""SuperKit"" for my 6 year old granddaughter.  I liked being able to get the  stand, stool, and headphones along with the keyboard.  The reviews were so good that I thought that I'd be safe to try this unfamiliar brand.Unfortunately, I had return the items because two keys in the middle of the keyboard had a very high pitch screeching sound.  I returned it to get another one with even more keys that were screeching.  Because my granddaughter may take piano lessons, I feel it is important that she has better quality.So, I returned two of these, but I will say that Amazon was terrific to give me credit for the returned items.  It was hard to take my granddaughter's Christmas present away from her twice. I ordered a Yamaha, at a greater expense, and it is wonderful.  I should have known better to begin with.  You usually get what you pay for.

   Probably would’ve been a great item if it didn’t arrive with keys that didn’t function. Also immediately after buying it became unavailable so I was unable to ask for a replacement which was a bummer. It was for a birthday present and she didn’t even get the chance to enjoy it fully.

    Static noise w/ headphones plugged in
  
",3.0 ,Henry Zheng,"Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2019","









  
  
    
  I tried both the HyperX Cloud Pro & the RockJam headphones that come with the keyboard (these are SUPER uncomfortable by the way), and in both cases I could hear an annoying static noise. The instrument sounds fine without using headphones, but if you're like me and can't afford to play out loud most of the time, this might be a deal-breaker for you.A minor note (no pun intended) to make is that the stickers started wearing out after only two days of playing. See the picture I attached for an example.Overall, this is a decent keyboard for beginners. If I didn't buy this during Prime Day at a discount, I might have been inclined to give it 2-stars; however, at the price that I did purchase it at, I'm content with what I received.

  I'm giving a 3 star review because the keyboard bundle in itself is great so far,  but it is a flat-out lie that the app with the music and teaching functions is free.  You sign up for it before you find out it is only free for 1 week, then you are charged $119.95 for the next year;  yes, you are charged the $119.95 all at once the week after you receive the keyboard and sign in on the app.

  I kept mulling over getting this keyboard because it was some brand I'd never heard of.  But the price was right, so I decided to give it a shot.This keyboard didn't even last me a second.I was elated to find this delivered and sitting on my porch and I couldn't wait to plug it in and try it out.  The instant I hit the Power button, I was blasted with feedback.  I fiddled with the power plug and the feedback died down a little, but it was still buzzing and it would not go away.This caused me to start to look at the keyboard a little closer and I began to notice the things I could not live without.Here were my issues with this keyboard, all discerned in the first 2 minutes:1.  The feedback.2.  The LCD Display was not working.3.  Very heavy.4.  The power button is very cheaply made.  It felt terrible pushing.  To give you an idea, this felt like I was pressing an emergency shunt to shut off gasoline pumps at your local convenience store (if you've ever done that).5.  The keys felt like cheap plastic.6.  The feel of the keys was way off.  It took too much force to strike a key.7.  I could see the circuit board in between keys.  This may seem insignificant, but this demonstrates that there is a direct path for your spilled drink to fry the circuitry.I really should've trusted my gut and gone with an established brand.

  STAND: I feel the stand works quit well.  Once you have everything tightened and the key board actually attached to it, it all feels very sturdy.  I love that it is adjustable in height.  I purchased this for my 5 yr old, (although it can be used for an adult as well), and the adjustable stand brought the keyboard down to just the right height for her.  (it goes pretty low to normal height)SEAT:  is not adjustable, but since the stand is, so it doesn't matter.  The seat is a bit small.  It's probably fine for a very small adult and children.  But if you are an average to larger size person like me, then you will want to purchase the piano separately and get a larger keyboard/piano bench.HEADPHONES:  not a very good quality.  They crackle at times.  I use a child's headphone set because it limits the volume output.LCD SCREEN:  Is nice.  If you want to know what a key is, you just press the key and it shows up on the grand staff on the screen.  But I use sticker notes for my daughter, and you can see them better.  Nice to have a built in metronome.CON:  (-1 star) Every time you turn the keyboard on, the default volume is max, and you have to adjust it.  I don't see a place where I can change this to default to a lower setting.  My casio turns down extremely low, and when I turn it off, the next time I use it, it is still at the volume I left it on.  I wish that is how this one was.KEYS:  I find these keys are stiffer than my Casio keys.  I was worried about my 5yr old being able to use them, but she seems to do fine with them, so they must not be that stiff.OVERALL:  great set & great price for a beginner.

  My 85-year-old mom is rocking this 61-key electric keyboard. It’s the perfect size for small spaces, and the headphones are a great solution to community living. If you have elders in your life, musical instruments like electronic keyboards are a smart way to keep them engaged and productive – especially if they already have musical training. Even for those seniors without a background in music, the RockJam makes playing piano accessible through the 30 demo songs and teaching program.More importantly, no matter your level of experience, the medium encourages multi-generational collaboration and use thanks to all the techno features – rhythms, tones, chords, vibrato, and demo tracks – that kids and grandkids understand and appreciate. The fun factor is built in, and the opportunities for practical application are also available. My mom is already practicing songs for a holiday celebration in their complex.  Maybe she’ll really wow her audience by setting one of the tunes to a reggae rhythm with a synthesizer tone.The added value of the foot pedal – a tool that sustains the tone of the struck note – makes the RockJam a serious musical instrument despite all its techno bells and whistles. Bottom line: You can be a rock star or a classical musician with this keyboard. An outstanding all-ages instrument for the young and the young at heart.

  I bought this for my 10-year-old granddaughter for Christmas. I had looked at several different keyboards.  What I like about this is that it has the mic, stool, pedal, headphones. There is also an App that it recommends to learn the keyboard and you can place your Smart Phone or tablet right on the stand and it knows which keys you're playing. If you put the headphones in, you can play or practice and no one around you can hear anything and the volume in the headphones is a very comfortable level. Considering everything I looked at I found this to be a great bargain considering everything that comes with it.

  Our son wanted a keyboard for his 16th birthday to learn how to play piano as well as make songs for computer games he was designing. We've purchased instruments before. It's easier and ultimately returns more value for the money if you also buy the extras, like a stand and bench. I was happy to find such an affordable kit, and surprised that it works so well. 6+ months later, all the pieces are still sturdy and functioning as intended. I'd buy it again and would recommend it. However, the cord for the AC adapter isn't very long. A power strip can help (and is probably a good idea anyway).

  I am an adult piano learner and this is a great starting point for anyone just learning piano. for the price point i do not think it can be beaten. yes you do not get as sophisticated sounds as you would with a more expensive keyboard but for a beginner it is fantastic. I found that the app Youcisian works much better than the one advertised with this set, Piano Maestro.
