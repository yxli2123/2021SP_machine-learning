    Very good refurbished Macbook Air
  
",5.0,Mom,"Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2019","









  
  
    
  I was nervous about buying a refurbished Mac after reading so many negative reviews, but I'm glad I did!  This is a great computer, updated with the latest OS and from early 2015.  For me, this is great for what I need it for.  I purchased the additional warranty just incase.  So far, I'm happy with my purchase!  My best advice is to read the seller's feedback page before buying.

    Decent renewed laptop. If it came unlocked

  Overall I‚Äôm satisfied with this; HOWEVER, when I initially received this laptop it was locked. I couldn‚Äôt use it. Called into Amazon tech support to help and their advise was to crash the computer....reset it. Well, thanks to their crappy directions and 2 hours on the phone, the laptop was not able to run. It crashed literally. Had to take it to Apple and pay for them to restore and update the unit. NOT happy with that- I would like my $70 back but I know I‚Äôm wasting my time even trying.

  I had to wait 2 weeks for this to be delivered. Then once it was delivered, I tried to set it up with my info. 2 steps in and a screen pops up saying this computer can only be set up by remote management from a certain school district. Apparently this computer was never wiped clean before resale. It was a total waste of my time. Plus now I have to try and get my money back for the extended warranty I bought as well.

  Do not waste your money or your time and energy. Please! I felt like everyone else who gave this a chance. I was nervous buying a refurbished computer, but this site had pretty good reviews overall. I was definitely wrong. The laptop shipped quick, but as soon as I pulled it out of the box- it wouldn‚Äôt turn on. I tried everything, eventually the following day I brought it to the Apple store to just make sure it wasn‚Äôt something as easy as the charger not working. NOPE! That‚Äôs when they were able to tell me the laptop had this weird covering on the bottom of it- which covered all the computers info. Turns out, it came from a school. They said it was definitely sketchy and had a hardware issue. I sent it back- it‚Äôs taken almost 2 weeks since I sent it out to get my refund- they issued it today, but it still says it would take 3-5 days to get in my account. What a freaking headache and waste!!

  I ordered this back in November 2019. I was skeptical at first but they also offer a 30 days refund guarantee if you do not like it so when I received it I very surprise because it is a small light weight laptop. It‚Äôs seems to be great quality and it turned on right away. It‚Äôs not brand new ofcourse but it is refurbished. It works great and runs very fast. It needs a lot of updating and if you don‚Äôt have WiFi then prepare for that. Battery life is okay. It lasts about 3 to 4 hours and takes about 30 minutes to charge until full. I saw some bad reviews and think it really depends what laptop they decide to give, every laptop is different because they are in different conditions. If you are in need for a laptop to either work at home or download apps to write a resume, etc. this is a good laptop to start with. If you want to edit videos and pictures, The memory is a lot but not that much and you can always buy more to install. (i think) If anyone knows let me know. Thanks.

  I‚Äôve had a horrible experience, I got in 2019 and recently found out there were these stickers on the top and back since the computer stopped working entries due to faulty hard drive and I needed the serial number but it was blocked out but the sticker since it probably failed due to the kids at school not treating the system well! It was blocking the ENGRAVING that it was from a school! Totally unprofessional and WRONG to hide! Was never told it was pre owned by a school and I thought it was stolen when I saw it! Amazon never issued a refund or replacement and got us all stressed out trying to find help. I would not buy again or recommend to anyone else to buy! If you do check the back and front for stickers hiding something not to mention all the scratches on the back from pervious owners! I feel lied to and betrayed and upset.

  I ordered this Mac Book Air, and reading from the description, I was thinking it would be wonderful. It was a good price, and I'm very familiar with Mac Books. I ordered this sometime in July, and it has worked perfectly. I decorated the outside with some of my favorite stickers, and I had all my information on there. It was my favorite thing I bought.""Oh, well why did you give it one star?"" you're probably wondering. Well friend, you see, this product came without 2 essential parts on the backside of the keyboard. When December came, my keyboard stopped responding to the computer completely. I called Apple about the issue, and what they told me over phone did not work. I had to visit Apple in person, so they could look at it. I was there for hours, and nothing got solved. So I then visited a Professional Computer-Repairman, and when he took apart the backside of the keyboard, he saw nothing wrong, until he looked deeper. He found that I was missing 2 essential parts to my laptop. He tried ordering these parts from China, but they have not responded.I have tried contacting Amazon many times, and they're not willing to help me out since my computer was purchased months ago, so it passed the 90 day rule. I feel as though this special situation should grant me a refund. But nope. Next time I order a laptop I will go to a Repair shop, have them take it apart, and see if anything is wrong. If there is, at least I can send it back within 90 days :).Ohhhh wait, I can't order a new laptop! I'm a poor college student and only had enough money for a laptop when I originally bought this one. And it was a complete dud! Can't wait to spend the rest of my college days in a computer lab. I don't think I'll ever buy from Amazon again. I'm sorry.

  I was expecting a computer with scratches and obvious wear, but there were only two scuffs on the side of the computer which are barely noticeable and well-hidden with a plastic hard-case protector. The computer is rather small and light-weight. Think: iPad Pro with an attached keyboard.The battery life is pretty good for this kind of computer, but that‚Äôs just coming from a college student who only uses it to write essays and browse the internet; I don‚Äôt use it for more professional tasks like video-editing . Someone previously said the screen is yellowish but that wasn‚Äôt the case for me. All in all, it‚Äôs a really good, functional computer for the price.

  I was a bit worried because last time I bought a refurbished electronic I had problems starting day one. But I decided to give it one more shot since I needed a laptop for school and I couldn‚Äôt be happier!Upon inspection I found no marks or scratches. It was basically brand new! Completely reset and easy set up once I got it charged and started. Only had an update that needed to be done but that was it. Ran so smoothly you would‚Äôve never known it was a used laptop.It‚Äôs only been day one but I was able to use it for 6 hours after the initial charge and the battery was only at 51% and that was with FaceTime and internet being used at the same time. It runs way and lasts longer than any other laptop I‚Äôve had around this price range and with apple I know I can count on this for a few years to come. I‚Äôll update in about a month to see if we are still loving this or what‚Äôs going.

  The product came with a free gift and only had super minor scratches. i waited to write this review after a month to see if it had any underlying issues and so far the only thing is it doesn't reach %100 battery unless i let it charge for a good couple hours. it still can reach %98 though in about an hour so its not really a big deal to me at the moment and it does last me a good couple hours after the %98 charge. If you're not trying to go broke and have a nice computer this is the perfect choice!

  I‚Äôve wanted a MacBook for a long time but it wasn‚Äôt really something I needed, as most of the functions I wanted to use in laptop form can be performed on an iPad or iphone at the end of the day.With kids and the expenses of normal life I just could never justify the expense of a solid MacBook.Not having a laptop may not have been a thousand dollar problem for me but a 350 dollar problem?? This was more my speed.It works, it‚Äôs a Mac, it does what I need within my budget.Awesome value

  Terrible. Feels like the computer has been taken apart multiple times. Product describes as ‚Äúnew‚Äù or like ‚Äúnew‚Äù, however, there‚Äôs poorly placed silver stickers placed on the outside to hide all of the damage. The first day I used it, the screen went out when I set it on my bed as well as the hinge feeling loose. Again, like it‚Äôs been taken apart too many times. Then a couple of days later, computer will not turn on or recognize the charger. A total piece of junk.

  The outside of the laptop was busted up. It came with a cover (presumably so you didn't see how banged up it was). A sequin stuck in one of the USB ports. Apparently they don't do a good job of checking ports. But - it works great so far and that's all I need. Also doesn't come with the extension portion of the cord - that was disappointing.

  If you think that your lucky, and your willing to toss 350$ or more out the window, or waste your time going to and fromThe post office. You should buy a used computer.  I have bought 3 used computers over the last 2 months. All of them were defective. The last one who I got from this seller, looked in mint shape, however once I turned it on and set it up, it forever locked me out and demanded a firmware password. I contacted these guys and they said, they don‚Äôt tech help send it to Apple. Apple said it‚Äôs to old and I would have to pay them to fix it. Just buy a new computer... save your time.

  The laptop looks and feels new.  Given that it would cost about the same to have my old one repaired, the money was much better spent on a refurbished unit.  Not knowing what the difference would be, I debated repair vs. refurbish and I'm very glad that I went the refurbished route.

    It‚Äôs worth my money I would say being a month
  
",4.0,Mirabelle Morah,"Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2019","









  
  
    
  It‚Äôs almost my one month anniversary with this product. It came just a few days after order and I waited a while to see how it works. At first I was so so so skeptical about buying a refurbished Mac or buying another high end laptop that wasn‚Äôt Apple but also really good enough and windows driven. I ended up with this, and was my expectation met? Yes in many good ways.Size: it was even smaller than I had expected, truly. I use a large dell desktop screen at the office so adjusting to this small screen with small fonts (though I can increase font size) was quite a task. But after a while of using it I got accustomed to it. I travel a lot and this is just a beautiful size for me without any weight at all! It can also fit into my small handbags if I wanted, and in my big travel backpacks it would not take up space.Screen color: when I first started using it I fretted a lot that the screen looked a very little yellowish, not as calibrated and bright as my former dell laptop and desktop at the office. But the MacBook Air gives you the option to calibrate your screen to different colors which I think is a beautiful option, then I increased my screen light / brightness some notches higher and the screen seemed to be bright and not too much of that yellow tinge anymore. Truth be told after a couple of weeks of using it I just got accustomed to everything bout my laptop.Battery: this battery could be better, truly. My battery lasts just for a few hours, truly. Perhaps less than 5 hours, maybe just 4 and it depends on what I‚Äôm doing on my system, whether I‚Äôm using the WiFi or whether I‚Äôm jus blogging or editing videos. Video editing, I‚Äôd advise you buy a higher version like a MacBook Pro that can take you. The more work and processing, the faster my battery seems to drain sometimes I imagine in my head that the battery lasts for only 2 hours because it goes down so fast to me. I‚Äôm not sure, but I always have it plugged in. It came with a clean new looking charger.Laptop: it came in beautiful without any scratches mmmm... maybe just a thin pink slash of line somewhere near the screen, but it was really clean looking I bought a case for it. The laptop doesn‚Äôt lag at all even during the time I used up the entire storage space. Fantastic. For a refurbed product, I‚Äôve been really enjoying it and it serves me more than well.I had to go buy a card reader and a hdmi dongle. Please beware that this doesn‚Äôt use thunderbolt3, I bought a dongle that has only a thunderbolt 3 input option and I regretted it. It‚Äôs a thunderbolt 2 related adapter you‚Äôd need.

  I was taking these online courses for school and needed a computer of my own. This was a good choice and at a good price for a high school student to purchase (it was at about $400 when I bought it). It was in really good shape with a silver covering on it. There was a VERY MINOR little dent on the top left hand side, but it wasn't that big of a deal to me. When I watch something on this computer, sometimes to screen blacks out for a second and then comes back, but that has kind of gone away. I think it only happens when I move it dramatically. This computer charges very quickly, but it also doesn't hold battery for very long. If I use it almost all day, I have to recharge it once or twice.Overall it's in really good shape and functions very nicely. I have had it for about eight months and it is a great MacBook Air. I would recommend purchasing it for a little go-go computer because it is small, but I love it!

Good good processor speed.So, this month, when I was looking for a new laptop, I bought the new version of the laptop. Noisy fan. Huge screen size for no reason. Expensive for no reason. Slow processor for no reason. Over heating for now reason. So, I sent back the macbook air 13.3 latest model. I bought this model instead.

    Excellent Small Format Laptop
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2021","









  
  
    
  I wanted a small format laptop that was high quality and powerful. I decided on a Macbook Air. I had no experience with Mac computers but luckily I have a friend who helped me make the right decision. Probably the most important thing to verify when buying a used mac is the year of manufacture. The year will be in a format like ""Early 2015"". This will determine the OS you can run on the unit. For example, anything Early 2013 or higher will run ""Big Sur"" the latest OS. Apple's website will tell you what the highest OS you can run on any given Mac. Secondly is battery health. A Macbook air battery is rated at 1000 cycles. Look in the system info screen to see the battery health. It should say ""normal"" with a number of cycles well less than 1000. Any less and your battery may have to be replaced soon and it's not easy for the casual user. Third is third party apps like MS Office which may or may not run on newer OS versions. For example, Office 2016 will run on Catalina but not on Big Sur. But on th bright side this a awesome laptop. Build quality is excellent with an aluminum case, nice keyboard, Nice touchpad and just an overall feel of quality.

  A few dents, the screen has only glitched a few times but other than that it has been a wonderful laptop. Camera and everything work great!

  Unfortunately, the product did not work at all! The laptop would not even turn on also the supposed Apple computer did not even have a serial number... although it did arrive properly so I guess that counts for something.

  At first I was a little scared to buy this because I am in college and I don‚Äôt have all the money in the world, plus some reviews had me a little hesitant, but my MacBook came and it works perfect and I love it.

  Bought this for my 18 year old for college.  It is perfect and half the price of new ones (if not more).  I would entirely recommend this for any new college student.

    Great MacBook!
  
",5.0,Jesus Sanchez,"Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  It is a great Mac. For it being a renewed laptop, it‚Äôs in almost perfect condition. Only thing mine had was a small scratch at the bottom as shown in the picture (which is hardly noticeable). I read some reviews and some seemed sketchy which made me hesitant to purchase but I‚Äôm glad I did. It‚Äôs also very good and fast for it being a 2015. Although I do prefer a bigger one since this one is a 11.6 inch.

    Function keys did not work

  12/29/2020I purchase this MacBook for my daughter for Christmas. This was a refurbished unit so the plain white box wasn't such a big deal. I wrapped it and under the tree it went. When she cracked it open on Christmas Day we noticed it seemed as though it was used and returned an no one even bothered to at least wipe it down with a damp cloth. Then once she started getting it set up she found that none of the top row function keys worked. I have reached out to the seller and will update this post to let everyone know what kind of customer service they can expect.

  Received item. However, cannot update because the computer is locked to an administrator remote management known as ‚ÄòRevere School‚Äô in the USA. Why advertise products that are locked and sell them for over $600??????? I sent it for return for full refund of the ‚âà$667 I spent. Will update info, once I receive my approved refund.
