    High Pitched Noise with PD after done charging, will overheat
  
",2.0,E.S.,"Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2021","









  
  
    
  It works wonderfully so far.Haven't done any high capacity transfers yet, so I cannot comment on the speed.However, I have noticed that it will emit noise after the target device is fully charged and PD is connected.Because said noise is unbearable for me, I have brought the rating down by two stars.Otherwise, I am currently happy with this product, and if the noise wasn't a thing, I would have given 5 stars.Update: After being used for a while with power delivery turned on, the hub will stop working, and must be disconnected and reconnected. I would assume that stops working due to the generated heat going across some threshold, and works best cold. As it is still functional for periods of time, it gets two stars, not one.

  I had two problems until I purchased this USB hub. I have extra lcd monitor but I can't connect it to my notebook computer because HDMI port has malfunction, and my wifi speed is so slow because my laptop is placed far from wireless router. I can solve these two problems with this device. I really like to connect my extra monitor to my laptop using this Hub. I can expand my screen and so cool~~! and then I can use Wire connection for the internet instead of Wifi. My speed upgraded hundreds times. I am very very satisfied with it. Moreover, it has two USB 3.1 ports. The usb ports on my laptop has been used fully because I used extra Keyboard and mouse and USB external hard disk. It was so inconvenient, but two USB 3.1 port on this Hub makes me so comfortable. I can used any usb device anytime. I am really satisfied with this Hub with reasonable price. So goooood~!!

    Two (2) days, and it's dead
  
",1.0,N. N.,"Reviewed in the United States October 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  Opened the box on Oct 19. Connected it to a Lenovo Thinkpad. Powered it with a USB-C 65-W brick. HDMI (to the monitor), and both USB-A ports (for mouse and keyboard) were used. The setup worked for two days. Sometimes the monitor would flicker but I didn't mind. Today, Oct 20, however, no power were coming out from the hub anymore, monitor went blank. The whole setup simply failed for no reason. The same set of equipments were moved to another hub and that worked just fine. So the fault has got to be this AUKEY 5-port USB-C adapter.

  I have struggled for a long time to buy an adequate usb adapter until I found this. My institute bought me a Dell usb c adapter which costs around $70 but only has one usb 3.0 port and no usb c port. To get one more usb ports, I communicated with my supervisor and IT staff for a long time with more than 30 emails, they all hesitate to find a better alternative or are unwilling to spend more money on it. Luckily, I found this product which immediately solved all my needs. It has two usb 3.0 ports and one usb c port, so I can connect my mouth, keyboard, and disk at one time. Moreover, this adapter supports HDMI and wire network and is quite small and light, so it's my best choice for business trips and conferences. I highly recommend it!

  I've had the Aukey hub for a week now, and I'm really satisfied with the quality. I was looking for something with an ethernet port and some extra usb ports for my laptop, but nothing too expensive or too big. The Aukey usb c hub is compact, but has a nice heft to it that makes it feel sturdy to use. All of the ports work fine, and I have not run into any problems. One usb port creates a lot of lag when I plug my wireless keyboard and mouse, it works fine with any other task. The keyboard and mouse work perfectly normal when plugged into the other usb port, so I'm still satisfied with my purchase.

    Slow Performance: Don't use with USB mouse!
  
",1.0,Jerryl Abraham,"Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2020","









  
  
    
  Really disappointed with this. I got this hub because my MacBook pro only has two ports. I use one for a VGA monitor. I still need to charge and use a USB wireless mouse so I got this hub. There's a really bad lag with the USB mouse especially when I have the charger and USB mouse plugged into the hub. It's sad because that's the main reason I needed it. I assume that data transfer speeds on the USB ports probably aren't as fast as advertised if it can't handle a USB mouse.

  I use a lightweight 12"" macbook with only one USB C port that has to double for power and connections.  As such I need a single dongle that handles display and USB out, as well as power in to drive my computer.This fits the bill wonderfully.  Haven't tried the ethernet port, so I can't speak to speeds there, but for basic USB functionality, power input and the ability to drive an HDMI monitor at 1440p it works really well.Build quality is totally workable:  it isn't bulletproof but I'm also not planning to run it over with a car.  The connections are sturdy, the USB-C dongle portion is well made, and it doesn't get too hot.  I've always been an anker guy first, with aukey being my second option but this has an extra USB port and ethernet vs. the similarly priced anker option.... so for my money the Aukey is a better buy.

  I was hoping this would work for my Lenovo Duet for Ethernet, but it does not show up. I have a HooToo USB C adapter that shows up fine, but this does not show up. It does allow me to charge and use the other ports on it though. I know the adapter works though, because it works in my XPS. So probably just an issue with the Chromebook and whatever drivers it cannot obtain yet.

  I love the Great size and material. My laptop does not have an Internet port so the only way to get the internet connection is to use WiFi which is not stable and affects my online meetings a lot. I was not sure to buy an 8-in-1 hub or 5-in-1, the only concern was that I worried about it will be too bulky so I bought this 5-in-1. The hub really surprised me with its smart size, it is a little larger than my AirPod which is very portable and the surface color is silver grey which I love the most. Overall, it is nice and I love it so much.

Then unplugged the ethernet cable and plugged it into my work computer that has an ethernet port built in and it works. Not sure why this just broke, as the USB spots and HDMI is still working.

  Ethernet, HDMI, USB 3.1... but not power through and HDMI at same time. 2019 MacBook Pro 16"" which has 96W USB‑C Power Adapter. With Ethernet, HDMI and 96W USB‑C power the Ethernet stopped working. Disconnected, let cool down and tried with just Ethernet, HDMI and one USB 3 device connected, that works. If I add the 96W USB‑C to power through this is gets hot and things eventually stop working. If AUKEY wants to send me another one to test while I hold onto this one, as I need it to be productive with Ethernet, that would be great. I can't have downtime running with only WiFi.

  Bought it for Dell Latitude 7480 (the i7 version w/ Thunderbolt USB-C). The USB hub works fine, but the PD pass-through and Ethernet doesn't.The Ethernet controller is correctly recognized by windows 10 if the hub is powered by laptop. But with an external PD power source connected & powering the laptop, the ethernet controller disconnects, or sometimes shows up as an ""unrecognized USB device"", meanwhile the HDMI port works like a hit & miss :(

Not sure if this is due to insufficient power (65W) as opposed to the 100W requirement.Overall, a good purchase.

  I'm an IT professional, and I cannot afford to have problems with my computer or peripherals when doing work for my clients. I need my hardware to be compact, light, and reliable. I look at the technology I use with a critical eye, and I have high expectations when it comes to the technology I purchase. That being said, this hub meets and exceeds my expectations.I'm using the QGeeM 8-in1 USB-C Hub on an HP Envy X360 Laptop and a Samsung S9 Plus Phone.There have been no recognition or connectivity issues on either device. The hub connects flawlessly to both my Windows and Android devices.While it is not likely that I will ever have the need to utilize all 8 ports on the hub at once, I did utilize 6 out of the 8 ports on my laptop...all but the HDMI and USB-C PD; and had absolutely no issues at all.I've been using this device for 8+ hours a day, and have had no unexpected disconnects or hiccups at all.If you are looking for an affordable, compact, multi-function hub, this is a very sturdy and reliable choice. Don't hesitate to buy!

In other words, when I restart, my Mac gets stuck showing the apple logo on screen forever until the adapter is unplugged.

  Bought this hub because it had the perfect combination of ports for my MacBook Pro running Big Sur - Ethernet, HDMI for a monitor, and two USBs for mouse and keyboard. The USB C power delivery was a bonus, but not necessary for me because I have two USB C ports.I ordered this hub because my old Ethernet to USB 3.0 adapter stopped working when I updated my MacBook to Big Sur (DriverKit update). This hub, however, works with Big Sur and lets me use Ethernet again. I'm getting my normal speed of ~250Mbps, so I don't actually know if the adapter provides gigabit Ethernet, but it definitely seems to work at speeds over 100Mbps. The HDMI lets me do 1080p@120Hz; I'm not sure if it will do 144Hz with a different computer, but I think that's the maximum my Mac can do.It gets a little warm, but that's to be expected with the power delivery, and it has not gotten alarmingly hot yet. The exterior is metal and looks/feels pretty nice, which probably also helps with heat dissipation.

  Love this product!!! Purchased to help k-12 kiddo who is learning remotely this year. Worked immediately as a plug and play device for her Acer Chromebook supplied by the school. No more slow wifi connection.... speedy ethernet connection will ensure she is the first to answer the teacher's question. Did not attempt the power delivery pass through. But the USB3.0 and ethernet connections worked perfect with no downloads or updates. Couldn't be happier. Thanks AUKEY

  Works great out of the box with Huawei MateBook X Pro. Gigabit connection is fast and reliable. USB and HDMI connections work perfectly without any issues. The power pass-thru is probably the best feature, since it lets you connect everything to a single USB-C port on your laptop. The cord is a little short (but on the other hand, perfect for keeping in a laptop bag and mobile use). I keep this plugged into my desk with the laptop's power adapter plugged into it, a wired Ethernet connection, and several USB devices (including USB hubs), and I can keep all of those cords out of the way by just using a USB-C extension cable between the adapter and the laptop (there are even several that match the finish).The adapter also looks nice, feels high-quality and well-designed, and the space grey aluminum finish matches  many current laptops very well (Apple, Huawei, etc). This also works out of the box with Linux.

  This Hub is perfect for transfering and data to/from my pc laptop to my phone, usb memomory, and displaying my phone/pc via HDMI to an external monitor. Works flawlessly and does not skip a beat. I have used with my Microsoft Surface-Go as dual screen set up by connecting it to my portable Monitor. Easy on the go set up all fits in my backpack and can work from anywhere. Also, charging capabilities are a perfect pass through. Also, can be used my with my Samsung Note 10 Plus to transmit my Samsung Dex to my portable monitor for another on the go set up when ever i dont pack my laptop. This is the perfect addition to my tech bag. I would definitly recommened to any one looking for a hub and also can provide internet via ethernet port since My Surface go table only has a USB-C port.

  I purchased this to replace a Lenovo travel hub that I was using to hook up all of my peripherals as I teach my online classes. I have to use an ethernet cable, an HDMI, a microphone and a writing tablet via USB-C. All of these devices work better with the new hub - the writing tablet in particular. It is no longer glitchy with the new hub because of the much higher transfer speeds. It has made teaching my online classes way less frustrating!

  Plugged device into USB-C port. recognized as a Generic hub. Attempted to plug an HDMI cable in, Result is no signal on monitor.I review the instructions included (which for a small hub such as this, there should be none). The instructions tell me to give up 1 of the 5 ports to power the device. Which means that this is really a 1-to-4 usb hub. And I would lose the USB pass-through, which it clearly states is available. I attempt this anyway, still no signal on monitor, no change on how the device registers on my laptop.I verified the USB C port with a thumb drive and it works fine.I am attempting to contact Aukey support, but based on the instruction guide, I expect I'll be returning this product as it appears to be not as advertised. I require a hub with HDMI, at least 1 USB C port  and at least 1 USB A. The Ethernet would have been a nice bonus.

    Solid build quality, minor flaw is that my wireless mouse must be within 1 foot of receiver
  
",4.0,ATan,"Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have tried a few of these USB-C dongles and they all seem to have some pro and cons. I will list my findings on other products at the bottom for comparison.This dongle seems to be built well and with quality materials (aluminum?). Unlike other products, the HDMI port (to connect a second monitor) does not intermittently go out and doesn't need to be wiggled into just the right position. Any position seems to work and it can be moved around without worrying about losing connection. The USB-C port for pass through power delivery seems to work fine for powering my laptop and phone. The usb 3.0 ports work well with my external HD, thumb drive, and a wired mouse. HOWEVER, all three of my wireless mice (via usb 3) need to be within a foot of the usb receiver to work effectively. When the dongle is plugged in on the opposite side of my mouse, it is very jerky/laggy or just simply won't work. It must supply a lower amount of power than other products. I will not use the ethernet port so I can't comment on how that works.Overall, at <$30 it's the best bang for the buck dongle I've used so far.Other dongles I've tried...Insignia 3 in 1 (from Best Buy):Pros - If I didn't touch or move the HDMI or dongle, everything worked great and I could use my wireless mouse 3' away from receiverCons - More expensive at $40, HDMI connection wasn't stable, got hot while using, cheap plastic, only 1 usb 3.0 slotApple 3 in 1 (my wife's):Pros - All ports worked pretty wellCons - Way overpriced at $70, HDMI connection went out once or twice but mostly stable, cheap plastic, only 1 usb 3.0 slotI wouldn't be surprised if apple and insignia were made in the same factory, they are almost identical, but the Apple one seemed to work a little better.Overall I recommend this over Insignia or Apple. Unless I find a solution to getting wireless mice to work better, I will make this work.

    TERRIBLE HDMI and Hissing noise!
  
",1.0,Kyle,"Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2021","









  
  
    
  I recently purchased an M1 MacBook Air. Seeing as how the M1 only comes with 2 USB-C ports I wanted to get a dongle that would allow me to dock the laptop and plug in a keyboard, monitor and power. The build of this product isn't bad. The case almost feels the same as the MacBook aluminum, the wire is typical and the USB-C end feels good when plugging it in; no complaints there. However, when I try to use the HDMI on this dongle I can only get 30Hz on my monitor. This is a known problem with the new MacBooks though. However, my Anker USB-C to HDMI dongle works just fine at 60Hz so there must be something specifically wrong with this dongle. If you want to use HDMI on an M1 Mac: DO NOT BUY THIS DONGLE. Another issue is the HISSING. When you plug a power adapter into this dongle there is a very noticeable hissing that comes from the dongle. While this isn't the most uncommon thing for anything running power through it, I'd expect an easier design like this to not have coil whine. So if you need to plug the power adapter into this dongle and you don't feel like hearing a terrible, constant high pitched noise, DO NOT BUY THIS DONGLE. I will give props to the Ethernet and USB 3 ports though. No issues on this. Overall 1/5 stars considering this product is $40 and only 2 out of the 4 functions work properly. Very disappointed and will be returning.

  I know Aukey is a reliable brand as I have had one of their power banks for about 3 years now. Since I have been remote learning for school, I considered connecting my laptop to a spare monitor I have to get more screen real estate. However, my laptop does not have any HDMI outputs for an external connection. I considered on purchasing a usb-c hub that has several usb-a ports for peripherals, a HDMI port, and an ethernet for when I can get direct internet. The Aukey usb-c hub 5-in-1 checked all of those boxes and I am extremely satisfied with the product.

    Overheats and ethernet port doesn't work consistently
  
",3.0,C. Meret,"Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  This product overheats when I use the ethernet port and hdmi port at the same time (that's all I'm using it for). In addition, my ethernet cable needs to be placed at the right angle in order to work, so moving it may cause it to stop working again. Overall, I don't trust the heating issue not to damage my cables and laptop ports (using it with a macbook pro), and will likely return it.

  Bought this to hook up my second monitor to my laptop. Monitor consitently cuts out every 15-30 seconds. It's not the cable, because the cable works fine using a different USB hub. Its not the port on my laptop, I tried using a different device.Absolutely waste of money. Do not buy. Had to get a refund immediately.

  The workmanship is very good. The appearance is not rough at all. It is very beautiful. The wire is OK. Plug in a few USB devices, it doesn't matter. The transmission speed is still good. It's a good choice for people who don't have any extreme requirements. There is no problem with the quality and performance, and it has a good performance price ratio.

  This is a good quality hub and I would recommend it for most people. I was able to hook up a 2nd monitor and hardwire my internet to my laptop. Internet speeds were very good with FIOS Gigabit.However 4 stars because you can not hook up two additional monitors. I had hoped you could hook up a monitor via HDMI and another one via USB C.So if you have no need for two additional monitors I would highly recommend this product.

    Ethernet connection issues
  
",3.0,TIMOTHY G.,"Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  The hub appears to be well built and the selection of ports is just what I wanted. HDMI and power delivery worked well. Unfortunately the ethernet connection continually disconnected. This would often occur for no apparent reason right in the middle of reading a web page. Other times it would disconnect when I was trying to access items on the local network. Device Manager would show the ethernet adapter as disabled and it wouldn't re-enable by right clicking and selecting enable. Re-booting would fix the problem for a few minutes but then it would disconnect again. I will be returning the hub.

  I'm not sure if I love it yet.  when I have it connected to my Macbook air and step away so the computer screen goes dark or it goes to sleep, when I come back to wake it up....it doesn't always wake up my monitor.  Sometimes I have to unplug it and plug it back in before it'll connect correctly.  Plus it's a little warm, not horribly but still.

    Great USB-C hub with a minor flaw
  
",4.0,Calvin,"Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2021","









  
  
    
  It's got 3 USB 3 ports which is fantastic as well as a USB-C for pass through charging. However, the USB-C can only be used to charge the macbook/laptop you have the hub connected to. I tried using the USB-C port on the hub for charging my phone, or attaching a flash drive peripheral and it just doesn't work with any of those. So the USB-C port on the hub is only for charging the laptop.
