    These cups leak so expect constant stains on your clothes

  I had been buying a different set of cups for over a year.  Then Amazon switched these to be there Amazon Choice cups, so I switched.  I've learned my lesson of following Amazon Choice.  Its clear they were just looking for the best deal for Amazon.  My first day with a cup of coffee, coffee drips out of the cup and onto my shirt.  I assumed I had not put the lid on well.  Scroll forward 30 days and I have paid to have 3 shirts and two pair of pants dry cleaned and one ruined shirt.  They simply don't seal well and the cups drip out liquid even when the top is fully on.  I don't know which makes me madder, that I kept using the cups or that I assumed Amazon would have fully vetted these before calling them Amazon Choice.

  We have ordered these cups several times without issue.  The most recent batch we received almost ALL of the cups leaked after a short time filled with coffee.  The bottom edge let liquid seep through, cups would buckle at the weak point and leak at the bottom.

  We have these Dixie cups on a subscribe and save order. We have been ordering these cups for about a year now. Our last order we noticed that the first few cups in over have the packs of holes in the bottom of the cups! This has led to quite a few messes because we don’t always notice.

  I didn’t want to believe the reviews on “leaks” but yup sadly there are some cups that leak and some that are just fine. Im disappointed because these cups are so cute!!! I use these cups for my coffee in the AM but might have to replace since they keep leaking!UPDATE: 12/2020I said I wasn’t going to buy these any more but I came back, I just couldn’t find any other better cups. I really love these! I haven’t had any leakage problems anymore. I feel like they really listened about the reviews.UPDATE: 02/17/2021Okay so now its 2021 and I’m still using these cups, I actually subscribed for monthly packages. Haven’t had a leakage problem since the first time I bought these. Im a happy customer we all love coffee here at home so these are used multiple times a day everyday !

  These are great! This particular deal is a great one! I use these every morning during the week day and have not had a spill yet. Make sure when you are putting on the lid that the hole on the lid is directly opposite to the seal line on the paper cup. Dixie disposable coffee cups are my go to and this particularly style is super cute since it has cute little messages on them.

  Good value for the price, but I can't give 5 stars BC after an hr car ridez any coffee left in my cup is pretty much cold. (I'm a slow coffee drinker). Also, the lids seem cheaply-made or poorly put together because they constantly pop off the top and several times I have actually poured/spilled some coffee all over me and/or inside my car while getting in and out of my car, which really sucks. I have a pretty long commute in the mornings so I was looking for something disposable and that would keep coffee warm for my son for his hot chocolate in my coffee so once I got to work I could just throw the cup away and not worry about the cops at my office or in my car. I recently found that the knock out yeti's for $8 at Walmart are actually amazing at leaving beverages actually hot for hours, so once we've used it all these cups up, I will probably be switching over to those for our daily routine and just continue to search for a better quality to go cup to use as needed.

  This is an excellent product. These cups have leak free lids, and when full of hot coffee they aren't too hot to hold.The 12 ounce capacity is just right for most people at my office. I love they aren't made from styrofoam despite feeling like they are. I hate to say that I trust Dixie brand for a reason, but yes, I really do.The lids attach firmly and are easy to put on. The cups are sturdy enough to wash once or twice and reuse, and they hold up to an overnight with water in them. (Clients sometimes set a cup down half full and leave it there. If we are in a hurry closing up, we don't always notice until the next morning.)These are thick enough that no sleeve is needed, even with piping hot liquid inside, there are no burned fingers.

  I'm very excited to have this as a Subscribe & Save option! I was forever forgetting to take clean coffee cups to work (I only have cold water there, so I had to take them home to clean), so this helps me out. The sayings are fun--a step up from the old cups they had. The lids work with the Starbucks ""plugs"" so your coffee stays hot longer. It's not going to keep your coffee as hot as a thermal cup, but it does help, and your hands don't get too hot while holding it (the heat of the coffee doesn't transfer to you hands much).

  As a way of connecting with my coworkers I set up a Keurig coffee maker in my cubicle and made it available to all.  I bought a rack for coffee cups and lids, K cups, sugar, etc.  Everyone loved it and in a very short time I knew my coworkers.These cups were perfect for us.  We went out in the field after a brief meeting every morning, so having a to-go cup that keeps the coffee hot and doesn't burn your fingers was great.  You don't need those coffee cup sleeves for these.  The textured surface protects your fingers perfectly.  The lids fit on snug every time.Now I'm retired, but my son still lives with me, and he enjoys saving the $5 he would need to pay on his way to his work if he couldn't just quickly make a cup to go.The cups come in random designs, and don't necessarily match the picture in the ad, but they tell you that up front.  All of the designs have been fine for a professional office.I priced cups that needed the cup sleeve to be able to hold them, and these are a better deal, in addition to looking a lot nicer.I recommend these cups without reservation.

    Leaks-Design Flaw
  
",2.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,MelonheadRed,2020年3月27日 在美国审核,"









  
  
    
  Update-It's gotten so bad with the leaking that's I've finally given up. I'm switching to another brand.So I’ve been using these for a while, and I’ve noticed that lately I’ve been having more and more problems with drips down the side of the cup where the seam is. After spending a ridiculously inordinate amount of time trying to figure out why, my best guess is that the seam in the lip of the cup, which has a raw edge, appears to wick up the liquid and when it becomes oversaturated, starts to drip down the outside of the cup. I haven’t had the same issues as others with holes in the cups or lids ripping, but I have definitely had problems with leaks and stains on my clothes.

    Cheapest way to get quality hot/cold cups and lids
  
",5.0 ,John S. Kjellman,"Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2019","









  
  
    
  My family uses these cups for coffee every morning and they work great. They have a thin insulating layer around them so you can handle hot beverages. Note that it is thin so scalding hot beverages can't be held for too long, even a cardboard sleeve doesn't handle that for long.I find they hold up well and being packaged in groups of 26 lids and 26 cups makes it easy to store the extras until they are needed.

  Horrible! Every time I put the lid on it splits right where you need to take a drink! So annoyed by this. Thought I was getting a great deal because Dixie is usually a good brand but there must be some sort of flaw in the design with these lids. Also the cups are not quite durable enough. They look like they’ll fall apart if hot liquid is in them for too long, which is crazy since they are made for hot liquid. I definitely want my money back for these.

  I have been using this brand for years. Love them. This order was received and they are totally unusable.  The strong scent of perfume is imbedded in every cup and you literally get sick from the smell while trying to sip. Most of the lids were also crushed and rendered them useless as well. Has to be a seller issue. Very disappointed since I can not return them.

  I find the cups to be durable and fairly well insulated. They are coated on the outside so that they dont require sleeves. The biggest problem with this product, IMO, is the lid. The lid constantly (and soundlessly) cracks near the mouth, giving you quite the surprise as you're drinking. This isnt a horrible setback if you're working from home in a tshirt and jeans. However, office managers and people on the go may want to steer far clear of this product, unless your company covers dry cleaning bills.

  Does not leak through the cup. I use them on a daily basis for coffee. Very well insulated. The lid can leak if you line up the hole you drink from on the lid with the joint of the cup. But if you avoid this, the lid will never leak. This is a common thing with these types of cups so I don't really consider it an issue. The issue is when the lid leaks no matter how it is placed on the cup - which is obviously not a problem with this cup.

    BEST CUPS EVER
  
",5.0 ,Anna Osipov,"Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2018","









  
  
    
  I’ve ordered a few different coffee cups over the years and this is my favorite. I use them at home for my Keurig coffee to go every morning. They’re great because your hands don’t burn from the hot coffee, the lids not only fit perfectly but they’re easy to drink from. Some lids leak or the opening is too high and uncomfortable to drink out of. These are the best! If you’re looking for coffee cups look no further!

  Saw a lot of negative reviews, so I was cautious about buying these cups. We had used these cups from the store without issue and decided to order the 26 count (pack of 6) on amazon due to the low price. We have used 4 of the packs so far and no issues. The cups work great for a morning beverage on the go for us (Coffee & Tea). We typically only use these cups for 2-3 hours, so I cannot speak to their holding power for more time than that. I will update this review if we have any cups that leak.

  This was probably my mistake. With the majority of the other listings on the site, it gives the cup size in the title. This listing does not, and I did not realize that I ordered 150+ 12 oz cups, instead of the normally 16-20 oz size that I buy on Amazon. They're Dixie hot beverage cups - of course the product is good quality, just definitely too small, and that ruins the whole thing for me. I have no use for these.

  One weakness I found about the dixie cup was the softening at the bottom of the cup after used as a warm to hot container.  Trying to replace a lid makes the cup collapse at the bottom.  Most cups in the past stayed firm after several uses.

    Only 156 Cups
  
",3.0 ,E. Small,"Reviewed in the United States November 3, 2012","









  
  
    
  These do keep drinks warm for a bit, but they aren't wonderful.  I was also surprised to find, when I opened the box that there were only 156 cups and 156 lids.  I see now that there is one picture that says 156 cups, but the item description says 312 count, which seems to indicate to me that I would receive 312 cups and 312 lids.  Normally, when I buy this type of product it says something like ""26 cups and lids"" (which is what each of the six interior packages said).  There were 26 cups and 26 lids in each of the six interior packages.  I guess in summary, these are the same quality that you purchase at the grocery store, and since you are only getting 156 cups, they may be less expensive at your local store.Update: Amazon gave me a partial refund for my order and has updated the description accordingly.  The price is now also lower than it was when I wrote my original review by approximately $10, so I will be buying again.

  I bought these cups because I hated taking a reusable mug just to find myself carrying it around all day (literally, I don't have a bag or backpack.) These cups are the perfect size and keep the beverage warm enough long enough to enjoy it. They do let some heat out, but sometimes I do not want scalding hot coffee (haha.) They also have a foamy texture on the outside which helps you keep a grip on it. I will buy more once I run out of these.

  Dixie To Go Hot Beverage Cups and Lids are an excellent idea to have on hand, in case you’re running late and don’t have access to a reusable thermos. However, there are a few things to consider before choosing them as your go-to, disposable hot beverage container.Pros: 1. These cups do a fantastic job of keeping beverages hot. I’m able to enjoy my coffee at a reasonable rate without having to gun it down before it gets cold; that’s one of the reasons I use thermal, disposable cups versus reusable, ceramic mugs. I don't particularly appreciate having to rush through a cup of coffee or tea.2. The plastic lid prevents the contents from spilling, which I appreciate since I’m relatively clumsy.3. Each cup contains a funny, unique saying that puts a smile on my face.Cons:1. These cups do not have a sleeve to protect your hand, which surprised me since that’s the norm. It seems easy enough to include a cardboard sleeve that you can grip while holding your beverage. Unlike foam, which isn’t recyclable but keeps your drinks hot without burning your hands, these cups transfer a tremendous amount of heat, and within seconds your palm is in pain.2. These are technically recyclable, but that depends upon where you live.If you don’t have any nerve endings in your hands, then I suggest you try Dixie to Go Hot Beverage Cups and Lids. But if you’re like me and can still feel the heat, then I don’t recommend these cups unless they include a cardboard sleeve in future packages.

  I fell in love with these cps a few years back.  I used to bring my own travel mug to work with me each day but what I found over time was that there was a buildup of residue in the lid of the cup that never would come out.  I then moved on to buying these cups from Costco, but the issue I had was that Costco would sell the cups in packages of 140-160 and the lids in packages of 500.  So at any given time I would have extra cups or lids.I ran out of cups - yet again - and I found myself on Amazon looking for the same disposable Dixie cups I love.  I found this box with 6 packages in it for a great price - I would guess it was comparable to the cost at Costco when you buy the cups and lids - and you don't have to worry about having an extra 100 lids or cups at any given time.These cups are great for hot coffee.  They keep your hands from getting too hot.  They also don't drip that much - because I've gone to work with coffee droplets on my shirt on multiple occasions.  The lids are tall enough that the coffee doesn't splash out through the lid either.  Overall, these are the best travel cups I've found and I don't have to worry about things growing inside the lid.  Plus they are also a great value - which makes it all even better.

  I find these cups very convenient in a pinch if I want coffee on the go.  They are pretty durable.  I actually get a few reuses out of them a lot of times (the failure point is when the lid no longer seals properly around the rim of the cup).  The one problem I have is there is no hole to let air into the cup while you are drinking, like most normal coffee lids have.  This results in terrible flow of coffee which I find annoying.  The easy solution is just to poke a hole yourself, which I now know to do.  But if you forget or you don't realize that is the problem, you may be in for a subpar coffee drinking experience.  If anyone from the Dixie company ever reads these things, I would highly recommend that minor upgrade to your product.

    Dixie Cups Quality Has Reached New Lows, Plastic Lids Consistently Break
  
",1.0 ,Jakesdad,"Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2018","









  
  
    
  These cups are supposed to have plastic lids that prevent spills. I used to purchase them from Costco because they were larger quantity for less money. However, I stopped buying them there due to constantly cracked plastic and lids falling off. Not to mention spills... I hoped that different packaging would mean a different source for the product, but these lids do the same danged thing. I have spilled more coffee picking up a cup that the lid has broken than I have had lids not break. They snap on fine, but within 1-5 minutes, they crack and are no longer attached to the cups. Time to find a different alternative, unless you don't care about having a lid. Otherwise boycott Dixie Cups.

  I have been using these for years and loved them. I ordered another case in January of 2020 as I was getting low. I recently started using the new case after running out of the last order and there has been a product change. The lids are no longer as pictured. They look similar but are now gray. Whenever we try to use these the lids crack and leak. Upon closer inspection all the lids have a thin spot near the mouth hole and when you snap on the lid they crack or worse yet the crack half way through the drink. Both my wife and I have spilled coffee down the front of us while driving. Unfortunately I am past the return window and now have a case of cups headed for the trash as I have missed the Amazon 30 day return window. These usually last me several months so you may also find that when  you get to a new sleeve they are junk also. I will go back to buying local so I have someone that stands behind the product. Seriously makes me think twice about buying something from Amazon that you will not use within 30 days. Buyer beware!!

    Decent Cups, Defective LIds
  
",3.0 ,TheWiseMan,"Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have a lot of experience with different disposable cups, especially Chinet and Dixie. I bought these thinking they'd be reliable. While the cups are mostly fine, the lids are split in the package, making them unable to actually stay on the cup and risking burns and spills.The cups themselves feel spongy and can be hot to sensitive hands, but otherwise felt comfortable to use.The lids are flimsy, and came with splits where they are meant to seal around the cups. See the pictures for what I mean.I am a bit surprised at Amazon's NO REFUNDS and NO EXCHANGES policy on these. I'd think defective hot cups would be important, and warrant exchanging for non-defective cups as a matter of customer safety.If you decide to buy these, be VERY careful.

  Cups hold about 11-12 ounces of hot beverage, lids fit onto the top easily and securely. I know they are disposable, but I often write my name on them (when I am at home) and use the same cup 3-4 times (even if I have had coffee, I can easily rinse it out to use for tea if I wish). Makes my life easier, as it is one less thing I need to wash every day (I drink coffee every day) and if I have more than one cup of coffee in a regular ceramic cup, I need to really wash it out with a sponge (not just rinse it) as I find that the ceramic cups hold coffee residue moreso than the disposables. My family liikes the idea of take and go coffee cups that they don't need to worry about rinsing out and returning home. They don't want to necessarily carry around an empty coffee travel mug all day. And it saves quite a bit of money, considering that the average cup of coffee at the popular coffee spots run $2-$3 each and this usually ends up costing about 80 cents a cup including the coffee pod and the creamer.

They are easy to hold - the cup is never too hot to handle.  Lids fit perfectly & hold in the heat.  These NEVER leak!!  (I don't know what the negative reviewers who claim their cups leaked did to them.  They NEVER leak -- never!  They are a bit more expensive than some other disposable coffee cups, but are higher quality making for a bad comparison.  If you want a high quality disposable cup that keeps your coffee hot but isn't too hot to hold onto, these are the cups for you.  I will definitely reorder these!

    Not a quality product
  
",1.0 ,Rachel Olson,"Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2019","









  
  
    
  I’m really disappointed with this purchase. I purchased these for my salon and while what I received is similar to what is advertised, they are not the same design or color. What’s more important though is not all of the cups are fully lined meaning, when you put any liquid in them, it seeps through to the outside lining. It affects the flavor of the coffee/tea and you can definitely feel it. I’m not saying you’re going to get burned but it’s not a pleasant warmth either. I can’t allow my clients or anyone else to use them. Definitely would not purchase again.

  Up until now all has been ok, lids not the best but this last order the lids were damaged bad enough that when you pick up the cup, the lid flips off.  Not really happy but basic cup was needed even if the lids were bad.  I have attempted to contact the Dixie company but no reply and it as been weeks.  Exactly who is the shipper?  The lids are constantly damaged I assume in shipping or the storage of the cups before being shipped.  Would love to have some answers.  Have bought these cups for years and until recently happy with the product......

  For years I have used these cups with no issue. The latest batch is different. While the photo shows the older model with black lid, I received ones with gray lids. The look to be the same design, but all of the lids crack shortly after putting them on the cup. I thought possibly my batch was damaged, so I tried some left over black lids from my previous order, and those cracked too. All I can come up with is that the size of these new cups is SLIGHTLY larger and stresses the plastic lid.Amazon was very helpful when I reported this and gave me a refund.

    Best coffee cups I've ever used
  
",5.0 ,Vermont Mom,"Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  These are the best cups. I buy them all the time. Coffee and cold beverages. Use all day, rinse out between use, and they don't lose their strength.  Nice grip, hands not slide.  Microwave for 1 min 25 sec to reheat cold coffee, microwave for 20 sec or so to rewarm cooling coffee with lid on no problem. Sipper hole is awesome, not flip open and stick in opposite spot. Ya know those that come unstuck and hit you in the nose. Just make sure you've got the lid on right.

  I've ordered these cups several times and have been very pleased with them. I have also dropped my cup several times and the lids do NOT pop off which is wonderful to me.  They are attractive, lightweight and pleasing to the eye. I order the 12oz. Size and it fits with my Keurig just fine. I've  put it in the microwave for no more than 30 seconds to re- heat and no issues as far as melting or anything like that.  I've tried several other cups that come with a small black lid and they pop off all the time or they are shortened in the count for cups.  That's very frustrating with 25 cups and 20 lids! Would highly recommend these cups anytime. I love them!!

  Great deal on this multi pack of travel cups. We bought these mainly to use on road trips where you want to take a coffee with you but not deal with the mug in the car the entire time you're gone, but we've also ended up using these for coffee to go for houseguests too. Cups have a nice feel with the integrated insulation, keeps your hand from getting hot and also has a little texture for grip. My only complaint would be that the cups are a little soft, so that it can be difficult to get the lids snapped on securely, but that is a pretty minor issue. Once snapped on the lid is very reliable.

  I love these cups, but I DO NOT recommend putting them in the microwave. They are covered in a thin film of plastic foam (that's the best way I can think to describe it) that insulates the cups, so when you microwave them, they smell terrible. They do keep your drink hot for quite a while, though, so you don't really need to microwave it unless it stays out for a while. Then, in that case, you might want to transfer it to another cup first.

  They start leaking just above the bottom rim after the 2nd cup of coffee, then you have to get another to use during your commute.  The manufacture doesn't want you to get a day worth of use out of it!  Others have posted pics, check them out.

Afew of the lids had gotten bent while in transit(I'm assuming), but nothing was cracked or broken.I was really surprised at how fast I received them. I used my first one today and don't have to worry about needing to bring it back home like I used to when i carried a travel mug of coffee to work. This? I can just toss when I'm done. I also don't have to worry about my husband leaving it in his truck for days and then returning with a moldy travel mug days later.  These should work out well for us.

  I can't imagine giving a set of cups a bad review. They serve their purpose in getting coffee, tea, and cocoa ready for a quick run on the way to do errands, head to class, or get to work. The affordable price makes them worth it over reusable travel mugs. However, unlike my reusable travel mugs, these ones actually fit under my Keurig.

  Once again disappointed by a misleading product description. The description clearly says the cups are paper, but when I received them, they looked like styrofoam cups. I researched the Georgia Pacific website, and the specifications state ""PerfecTouch® cups are made from paper with a polyethylene coating and contain approximately 80% compostable cellulose fiber by weight."" To me, this says that the cups are 20% chemicals, and since the paper is 'coated' with the chemicals, that means the hot liquid can cause leaching into the beverage. Not what I'm looking for.

  We bought these same cups at Costco, but I wanted to write a warning review on Amazon.  My daughter uses these for milk while she drives to work.  Almost every single time, no matter if the cup is below half, the milk will shoot out the hole when she puts it in the cup holder.  Because the cup is not as sturdy as the heavier Starbucks-style cup, it is also easy to ""squeeze"" you drink out when carrying it.My advice...you get what you pay for.  Cheaper, but easily spills creating a mess.  When you're ""On the Go"", it is doubly frustrating.

  This is without a doubt the worst coffee cup ever made.  The seal of the lid does not hold with hot liquids.  That means it either drips down the front of your shirt when you drink it, or it sloshes out into your car when you make a turn.  We actually threw out the rest of these cups due to the poor quality.  Save yourself the aggravation and use a paper cup with a quality lid.

  Mostly good product experience -- such a delight to be able to make your own to-go coffee, then drink up and toss the cup as you go about your morning. My only criticism is the ""dribble glass"" effect of the reinforcing indentations on the lid... they didn't leak, but out of the corner of my eye, when drawing the cup to my mouth for a sip, they look like the hole where the coffee comes out. Thence a stream of coffee down my right cheek! Mundane criticism for a mundane product -- I'd still buy it again, now that I watch the lid like a hawk while picking it up to drink. :)

  Before buying these cups/lids, I saw some reviews saying that the cups leaked. But I figured it must have been a fluke, and that it was probably a bad batch or a temporary issue. So I bought them anyway... big mistake. The cups leak, it's like the lids don't quite seal correctly, so coffee drips out onto your hands, car, or clothes. I emailed Dixie and they sent me some coupons and asked me to send back some samples so they can check into it. But unless you don't need to walk around/drive with these cups, I wouldn't recommend them.

  I actually hate it when someone posts a review and assigns stars to an experience, or some system or concept other than a review of the actual item. But here I am sticking my own opinionated foot in my mouth - so to speak.The cost per unit shows to be 9 cents each. But in point of fact, it is actually 17 cents apiece (a piece is defined here as one cup and lid combo). If you apply the subscription price, and the one time first purchase credit of $1, it brings it down to 16.4 cents apiece. I have sent an email 10 minutes before posting this for you good folks, to the other good folks at Amazon. I assume this will be corrected forthwith, but I am posting this in an attempt to at least save someone from being herded off the cliff as I almost was. On an intuitive whim, I decided to do the math real quick and discovered this error.As soon as this gets corrected I will promptly come back and remove my review, as I have not yet had the opportunity of using said item. My one star review is just an attempt to grab as many folks attention as possible to alert you to this error. If you agree that this is an important bit of information, please mark this as helpful so it will find its way up the cue to be noticed by as many people as possible. Bon Appetit!

  The coffee lids were made of very thin plastic and they were all cracked. So you use the cup without the lid. Dixie needs to make a sturdy lid.

  Nice looking cups and a fair price.  Wanted to try another coffee cup that was a good, but not as expensive as what I was purchasing.  I was sort of disappointed with the sturdiness of the cups.  A lot of give especially in the center of the cup when filled with hot or cold liquids.  None of the cups have broken, but you do need to be careful when picking up the cup.  The lids fit perfectly, but wish there was a cover for the opening where you drink.  Overall a rating of 3.

  Have ordered these twice now.  Amazing quality.  Great value too.  The lids hold tightly, have never had any issue with that.  They keep warm and yet no matter how hot the beverage I don’t burn my hands with the cup.  Design/pattern on them is simple.  Packed well, in a few sets per bag, packed within a bigger bag.Originally bought these when I was having extensive renos done on my home and had many workers over daily.  Was easier to give them coffee in these disposable cups.  Also when guests come over I ask if they want a to-go coffee/tea and they love that idea.Then covid hit, and my husband began taking his coffee to work in these cups in the morning, rather then using a reusable cup that he’d have to bring back home at the end of the day.Highly recommend these.

  26 cups and lids in each bag.6 bags in total.Cups have a coating on outside that enhances grip,so they won't slip out of your hand.Lids are durable.You can bend and flex them without any cracking.Lids fit the cups good and tight.I have used one cup and lid for 4 separate coffees over a 12 hour period and the cup still feels brand new .Absolutely no leaking.Good insulation against heat,but after holding a cup of really hot coffee for a full 20 seconds,you will really start feeling the heat on your hand.Just picking up ,sipping and putting down,you can barely feel the heat.Overall,I am very happy with purchase and will buy again.

  Pros: -12oz sounds small but it's huge. -Very well insulated; I never have to hold the hottest of drinks with the pads of my fingers like a spider on a hot skillet, I can fully wrap my hand around the cup for long periods of times with out feeling like I'm about to be burnt. -Nice squishy foam exterior, standard white wax paper walls inside. - No taste, hasn't tinted the taste of any of my drinks.Cons: just an 1/8th of an inch too tall to remove from a Tassimo brewer with out having to tip it forward just a smidge, not a deal breaker.

  Arrived on time, even 1 day earlier. I was a bit confused by the description & reviews & wasn't sure if I'm gonna get only one pack or a full box. It turned out to be the full box containing 6 packs of 26 (total of 156 cups).Upon opening the box I could say it was good quality by the looks, touch & smell! They feel very nice & soft to the touch & don't have any smell. I've used 2 of them so far & no leaks.There are 2 designs shown in the images. I don't know if it's random, but I got the striped design.
