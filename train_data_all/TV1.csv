  I replaced one of the earliest samsung lcd screens which cost $2400 years back. First i must say that i live in a rural area and have antenna television. This tv exceeded the air channels i previously could get. Then came the surprise. When i connected it to wifi, here comes ""samsung tv plus"". I now have hundreds of channels free. Next, the apps are much faster than my blue ray player. You can switch from tv to amazon to netflix in seconds. The picture quality is unreal. I watch alot of old tv shows from the 60s and 70s. I never thought id be right on the set of gunsmoke lol. The one and only downfall is the speakers. Volume ranges from the show to the commericals greatly. I highly recommend a soundbar. All in all a great tv.

    A Home Theater Experience
  
",5.0 ,April T.,"Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2021","









  
  
    
  I saw this on one of the Amazon Prime Truck deals.  I was going to pass but the price was right.  It arrived within 2 days and the delivery was exceptional (even by Amazon standards).It’s a large TV, but the physical set up was simple even for one person.  I don’t have cable so I connected my antenna and set up my smart functions.  Most of the apps I use were already loaded so all I had to do was log in.  It even updated my Xbox.  The universal remote works on everything connected (one remote to control them all).The picture and sound quality is great.  It gives the space a true home theater feel (which is what I was after).  I watched a John Wick marathon and haven’t left the sofa all day.  I’m beyond happy with this purchase.

  I already had two high end Samsung TVs on upper floors.  I bought this smaller, lower end TV for the basement in my home gym.  Lower end in that all the specs are higher on my other TVs (size, motion rate, etc).  But it looks perfectly fine.  Had no trouble with setting it up.  I  like having all my TVs by the same brand.  They all have the same remotes. Finally got rid of the old projection TV that was down there.  So happy all my TVs are now smart.  Samsung seems to the top of line in TVs now.

  Alright. First off I never write reviews EVER!This tv is amazing especially for the price. I buy multiple TVs every year for my business, hi end, 8k, 1080p, roku, Amazon, all of it.This far and above the best bang for buck 4k TV I have ever seen.It rivals so many higher models from other manufacturers.My first arrival was a cracked screen, however amazon replaced it for me in less than a week!!The second one came with zero issues. So many things being shipped these days its always a dice roll moving tvs.All that said, if your on the fence, and spending hours looking at other tvs within 50 to 100 dollars, stop searching and buy this one.

  TV is fine, especially for the price.  But Samsung's OS is absolutely terrible.  It is super slow and glitchy.  They don't let you download certain apps.  It barely ever works with Screen Share from an android.  And its loaded with a bunch of ""channels"" that you will never use, which further gums up the OS.  Just overall poor performance.  Just buy a Chromecast and forget about it.

    Samsung support is awful.
  
",1.0 ,S Lewis,"Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2021","









  
  
    
  TV has an unwatchable dark picture when using built in apps (HDMI input displays fine). Samsung support setup a repair ticket and cancelled it after a week without telling me why. The second support ticket was cancelled too. Finally, they informed me that no repair techs were in my area and they would have to replace it. After another week, they informed me that they can't replace it because there are none in stock so they would have to issue me a refund and pick up the TV. Then they told me they can't pick up the TV because of my location but would still issue me a refund. I'm still waiting on the refund. I live in Northern Colorado and not in a rural location by any means and yet Samsung is unable to service my area apparently. The entire support experience has been ongoing for nearly a month to try to get this resolved.

  Smart tv, I thought I could down load all the normal apps that I use on my iPad.  NO, it only has very few apps you can down load - no CNN, no NHK world, etc.  I thought something wrong with the tv. I called the Samsung, The Person was very good with explanations, Samsung doesn’t support those Apps.  So you can’t get them.  It has all the junk tv apps already built in.  You end up subscribing Cable service to get channels you want to get.  Also, sound system is not very good.  Being 65”, I expect better sound system.  If I knew, I could have kept my old Samsung tv with cable service.  Check your favorite apps first before purchase it.  It would be expensive waste if you don’t get what you need or want.

  So I give this TV four stars. Haven’t bought one in 7 years so forgive me if the stuff I talk about is the new status quo. For starters love how the tv automatically finds my local channels and auto controls fire stick (yes I have to use fire stick only because Samsung still has not talked twitch into making an app for their products) but having the fire stick part of your hub menu saves a point from being deducted since It’s the same effort (meaning I don’t have to switch sources, it acts as if hdmi is its own app) plus I don’t have to switch remotes so again a huge plus. TV is not out of the box ready, super hard to watch movie/show that is dark. But changing to dynamic mode then expert settings and turning shadow detail to 5 really helped. A good balance unless you wanna switch back and forth because dynamic mode without tinkering is too bright on its own if not watching night scenes. The recommendations on the hub is super annoying and if I was in bad mood would give tv 3 stars because of it. Aside from that, first week tv kept freezing stalling but heck it was sitting in warehouse for months so I let that slide. Works perfectly now. All in all good buy. PS Samsung add the darn Twitch app please.

    The remote is terrible
  
",3.0 ,alex,"Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2021","









  
  
    
  The TV is fine and does everything it is supposed to do.  HOWEVER, Navigating the television via the remote is a tedious hassle.  A good remote allows you to use that one remote for TV and Cable.  This is not a good remote though.  There is no number pad on the remote so you have to use a button on the remote that opens a number selector that scrolls from side to side.  If you use the mic on the remote and say ""seven"" then you will get every show that remotely has the word seven in it appear on your screen.  If you choose to scroll through channels using the channel button it is very slow moving between channels.  The channel button goes up and down but if you press on the edge of it it opens up a guide to PPV movies and you have to use your cable remote to switch back to your guide for regular tv channels or else will only scroll through PPV channels.  The remote has dedicated buttons for Netflix, Amazon, and Samsung TV.  These buttons are not programmable so your stuck with them as your default streaming buttons.  You can open the menu to select other streaming services though.  In that menu are services that are stuck on there and cannot be removed from the menu although services can be added to the menu.  Did I mention the remote is terrible?

    Ok picture quality but totally FAILS with basic features
  
",1.0 ,Jerry Doe,"Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2021","









  
  
    
  The picture quality is pretty good but the brightness leaves a lot to be desired. If you are watching anything with dark scenes or playing a game with a dark atmosphere, you absolutely cannot use the TV without blinds or you must use it at night. If not, you’re basically just going to be staring back at yourself through the screen.Also, let’s make this 100% clear. This TV does NOT support 120hz, so if you’re thinking of picking it up for the new consoles, look elsewhere.What really sucks about this TV is the Smart Features. The only feature I constantly come into contact with is the unbelievably annoying “Audio Setup.” I bought this TV with the Samsung sound bar bundle. You would think a sound bar made by the same brand would work with the TV but it just doesn’t. When I first received the TV, every single day, the TV would go through setting up the sound bar for no reason at all. The TV will emit a high pitched tone for 5-20 seconds, then it’ll say “Setup Complete”. Sometimes it will do this multiple times a day and can be incredibly frustrating when it interrupts some impactful moment in whatever media you’re watching.And it will definitely interrupt, because every time this “Setup” process completes, the TV inexplicably switches to “TV Speakers” instead of “Optical/HDMI” which results in echoing of the audio due to the sound bar still emitting sound. To fix this you have to make your way to the settings (which has no dedicated button on the remote) and switch the audio output from “TV Speakers” to “Optical/HDMI”.After updating the TV’s firmware, this problem seemed to be resolved but it wasn’t. Every week it goes through the same process and on the day it decides to set itself up, it does it multiple times throughout that day. After scouring forums for solutions, I found that its a problem that people have had with this TV since it’s release. On Samsung’s own forums, this complaint was constantly dismissed as a “feature” (it’s an obvious bug) by their moderation bot, never actually addressed by anyone at Samsung. So they have no intention of fixing this problem. (Keep in mind this is not something exclusive to Samsung sound bars)Perhaps the most annoying part of this issue is that *sometimes* once this “Audio Setup” is complete, you are able to use the TV’s remote to adjust volume instead of the sound bar. Most of the time you can’t though as the TV often cannot recognize the sound bar. You read that right, a Samsung TV cannot consistently recognize a Samsung sound bar. So one week the TV works fine and is able to be controlled with only one remote but the next 3 weeks it will require that you use the sound bar remote to adjust the volume. It absolutely blows me away that Samsung would just ignore this issue when it is such a common complaint online. Its ridiculous that this is even an issue in the first place as these two items are MADE BY SAMSUNG and are often bundled together.I have the TV disconnected from the internet as I have a separate media device, but I am aware of the ads they hardcode into the TV’s “smart interface” as it is another common complaint on forums. It’s true, as other reviewers have said, that the TV requires 6 inputs to get to the setting page. I should know having to switch the audio over so many times.TL;DR: I wouldn’t recommend this TV to anyone. There are TV’s with better picture quality and better functionality with similar/ less expensive price tags out there. Not to mention, they probably have the ability to properly set up something as basic as a sound bar. Do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.

    Save your money

  For us dropping dollars for something like a TV in the $500 range isn't something we do lightly or can afford to do easily. We were still using an older 32 inch Dynex 720DP TV as our primary, living room TV with an older ROKU on it. We were excited to get a larger, 4K machine with smart features and only have to keep up with one controller instead of two. For our one stoplight town there is no cable or cable based internet. Everyone uses a wireless hotspot for internet/entertainment streaming. It usually works pretty good with a blip here and there occasionally.This Samsung got to be unwatchable because be it Direct NOW, Hulu, or pretty much any streaming service it would hang up frequently. We spent as much time watching a spinning symbol or get ""oops"" messages as we did actually seeing programs. I can't blame our internet speeds or the router much because my mother had no issues at the same time getting her programs on her little 19"" Insignia hooked to another ROKU. We can run a couple of computer/iPads streaming video and her TV at the same time. Even with everything off the Samsung struggles. Out of frustration I pulled out the old 1080 DP max ROKU we used on the old TV and connected it to the Samsung. Runs great. Just at 1080 and we're back to two controllers. So we have this 4K Samsung 50"" Smart TV that we can only get continuous streaming on if we have it hooked to another streaming device and are stuck at 1080 resolution. I could have gotten a basic TV for hundreds less at Walmart and just hooked the ROKU to it.The TV is annoying because when you turn it off the next time you turn it on it's dumps you into whatever is on Samsung's streaming app instead of the last app/service you were using. There is little on the Samsung service we want to watch. We already have our preferences thank you. We also had some issues with the time. We set it properly and sometimes the display will be 12 hours off. Turn off the TV and back on and it will (mostly) be correct then.Maybe it's the Tizen OS, but I'm not really impressed with the performance of the OS or the TV overall. The image is great. The user experience sucks, and not in a good way. There isn't a good tactile feel for the control ring or the OK button to make it easily usable without looking. You have to slide your thumb or finger around a good bit to find it when not looking. Also when you are holding the remote with the fatter part in your hand as you normally would the control ring and button do not fall intuitively under your thumb. They are a too far up. The volume and channel buttons are okay. Unless you are doing OATV the channel selection is a pretty much unused feature as all the functions of most streaming services are not using the channel button.I'm a licensed amatuer radio operator, even using computers to program some radios and run another one, I've been messing with computers since the mid 80s to include programming in a few languages back in the day, and have several echo dots in use around the house. So I'm not tech impaired. Other than the picture I don't find a lot to be happy about with this Samsung TV. The OS is not quite ready for primetime and the TV is more hindrance and frustration than it is helpful and a smooth your way smart device.Sad because I've been a Samsung phone guy since before there were smartphones and have a nice upper end point and shoot class camera I've been pleased with. This TV. Not worth the money.

  I have bought Samsung TVs, monitors and other products for years and have had zero issues with them... so far.This TV is possibly the worst Samsung product I have ever owned.The TV itself is fine, but the TV software is completely glitched. The TV randomly becomes unresponsive to remote control, menus hang and freeze causing the TV software to crash and reset. Setting up the TV without an Internet connection or skipping the privacy policy makes the TV unusable. Connecting the TV to the Internet makes it unusable later on as well. You get ""malware detection"" warnings about the TV built in software.It's a complete mess. This is not a finished product, I don't know why Samsung is shipping this.

  Pros:- It's a large TV with a nice form factor- Relatively cheap among 4K TVs of this sizeCons:- I had some color issues initially and had to modify the settings to get certain games/movies to look natural.- The Smart TV software is absolute garbage. The homescreen includes random advertisements and channels that I don't care about, and multiple apps don't work well. E.g., streaming with accompanying iOS app results in choppy audio and slow-to-refresh video. The Hulu app freezes whenever an ad plays.

  Just finished setting the TV up.  The picture out of the box made things look like bad soap operas from the 70's, but it's better if you go into the advanced settings and set the contrast to ""low"".  Sound is quite good for a cheap TV.The user interface is... obtrusive.  The documentation is terrible, so there's lots of blundering about trying to figure out how to get stuff set up the way you want it....And that brings us to the ""sponsored"" box in the home menu.  There's no way to get rid of it, as far as I can tell.  There's apparently more obtrusive ads that will show up if you don't disable them.  To do that, Samsung has helpfully buried the opt-out three levels deep in the ""terms and privacy"" --> ""interest-based advertising"" tab (Samsung apparently has bought in to the Orwellian school of marketing and product design).  I think all this does is prevent them from collecting data, so maybe I'm just going to get generic ads later on.At least with Amazon devices you can pay a few bucks to get rid of the propaganda.  It's pretty infuriating having stuff that you don't want to see pushed at you in a way that you can't get rid of.Nice integration with providers, for us un-cord-cut.  I have Dish, and the built-in app is moderately full-featured.  Nothing particularly obnoxious with the streaming apps that I use--yet.

  Great tv for the price. We've only had it up for a week, but so far it's working great.  Remote is very hard to use...it's just not very intuitive.  It's so bad, the person who designed it should probably be moved to another department. Luckily, we had an extra Samsung remote for a newer tv it works on this tv...but even that remote is pretty poorly designed. Regardless of the remote everything else went smoothly.  I updated the software first and foremost, before mounting to the wall.  Speaking of mounting to the wall...we were replacing an older Samsung tv, and decided to use the same wall mounting bracket we had for that television.  This tv needed larger VESA bolts than our old tv.  The manual and Samsung website says M8 20-22(MM) and our hardware store had 20's or 25's.  I'm here to tell you 20's or 22's will not fit this tv and give you any thread left to tighten - even with the thinest wall mount brackets.  We went with the 25's and they fit perfectly.

  I still can't believe how cheap this TV was. It's really great quality. I own this as well as the QLED version because I wanted to compare the two. It's hard to see much of a difference. I wouldn't say go with one over the other based on the experience. Very comparable. It's been a great tv and both of the remotes are identical so that has made it easy to not have to learn two different remotes. Very easy remote and the technology has been great. It auto detected my devices and appropriately labeled them for the most part. Sometimes I have to change inputs multiple times because it wants to do its own thing but it's just a few extra button clicks on the remote when it happens. for example when I boot up my Nintendo Switch it will turn on the TV by itself which is great but it doesn't load the switch screen it goes to teh home screen. I will change it to the Switch and then for some reason it shows the switch and then goes to the home menu again. Then I go to the switch and it stays on the switch. Kind of weird but consistent behavior. Not a huge deal though.

    My first 4K TV and I'm dissapointed
  
",3.0 ,James I. Velazquez,"Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  The price isn't bad for this product, but I expected much more from a Samsung TV. The picture quality is ok but it seems so dark no matter what setting I tried especially on the built in apps like Disney+. My PS4 Pro however seems to boost the colors and blacks so the color definitely looks better. The problem I have on my PS4 Pro comes with the sound. For some reason, even though everything is set to PCM on both the TV and the PS4, the sound is good on some things but slightly distorted on voices and other things. It doesn't sound even or consistent. However, if you do the built in test everything looks great and sounds great. I can't seem to duplicate the results on anything else. Very frustrated and disappointed.

  Sound quality is only average for any tv. That means anyone wanting great or even good will need a sound bar. I saw some reviews said it was great but they must still listen to an AM radio in their car with one speaker in the center dash I guess. I've been a loyal Samsung customer for 20 years. Gotta say I'm disappointed. I sent it back. You get what you pay for is still true. Tv plus soundbar? Cheaper by far to buy the Sony. Which I did. Very happy but not exactly a fair comparison.

  From day 1 TV makes a clicking sound every minute or so when on (and for ~15 minutes after being turned off).  Working on getting a repair person from Samsung to come and fix it.Ads are built into the home navigation bar with no option to remove.All apps I've tried (Netflix, prime, iHeartRadio, Disney) all work well with no issues.Remote has no lights so using it in a dark room is hard.The picture quality is great and works well in my office with some light during the day and looks very black at night.  Sound is good without adding a soundbar (if I ignore the clicking already mentioned).

  I had bought a smaller Samsung for my bedroom and really enjoyed it so when our 50in Vizio in the living room started to get buggy I decided to buy a 50in Samsung 4K UHD. Absolutely love the TV. Great picture, no grey areas as some reviewers talked about, and love that it is Alexa controlled. Would be better if I could edit the names of some of the inputs but overall it connected quickly and recognized all my add on equipment. Too bad you cannot totally get rid of some of the preloaded apps but no one lets you do that.

  Amazing TV and quality at such a great price.I was very amazed not only at the high picture quality and sound quality but also the many extras that Samsung includes in all their products including using voice Alexa.  The setup was “fantastic” because it was so easy using the internet and a Samsung account from a previous TV.  The remote & internet walked me through the rest and it look like a professional.The remote is still a little difficult using with my cable system, but with Netflix, DVD, Amazon Prime etc it’s much easier.The only problem is that sometimes my Alexa TV app and Alexa thermostat often both answer me, if you call that a problem.

  The first one I ordered arrived with a cracked screen. The box was completely undamaged so it appeared that it happened in the production/packaging stage. I returned it for a replacement. The replacement arrived and I set it up and, sadly, after all of the delay, I was not happy at all with the TV. The picture was really disappointing and the audio was not good at all, regardless of how high I set the volume. However, when turning the tv on or off, it was outrageously loud. I've owned some low-end tv's so my bar was low and yet this tv didn't even meet that (low) expectation. I packaged it back up nicely, making certain to repackage everything as it came and returned it. It arrived back to Amazon 11 days ago; still waiting for a refund.

  A 4K smart TV for a tech illiterate. The user manual doesn't offer much. Trial and error was my path of discovery. After a couple of months I think I reached a tenable position. My biggest quest was trying to figure out how to shut off my DVD player without the TV turning it back on. If I shut off the TV first the DVD player would turn the TV back on. It was like a conspiracy. The only solution was to unplug the DVD player. I finally found a line item deep in the TV smart operations. I didn't understand what it was but it had an on-off green dot. I pushed it to off and solved my problem. The 4K resolution with compatible viewing programs is incredible. Whether streaming, DVD or regular TV if everything is right the resolution will blow you away. This technology is almost scary. Having fun.

  The TV is beautifully designed and from what I can tell, crystal clear.. When it works. We waited 2.5 weeks for delivery and the service dropped it off today. Unboxed it and the TV was damaged beyond belief. Crack at the bottom of the screen, lines 6 inches deep on the left side and 4 deep inches from the bottom. Single black line through the middle. Not sure if it's a manufacturing defect or damaged during shipping. Talked to customer service, which was very helpful, but they couldn't initiate an exchange or expedite shipping. They were kind enough to refund the damaged product, but I had to rebuy the TV at a higher price from Amazon and now have to wait another 3.5 weeks for delivery of the replacement. The experience has been highly disappointing. Shopped local, but unfortunately the model isn't available here. Will update the review upon receiving the replacement.

Good speakers & volume, the remote is easy to use and we love the universal remote feature (don’t have to switch between XBOX controller & tv remote) one more thing I really appreciated is that it has the AV inputs that most TVs are getting rid of, so it’s easily compatible with older consoles. We also used Amazon’s mounting service and they came just 2 days after we got the tv & had it mounted in about 30 minutes. Very pleased with the product and the service!

",1.0 ,Moses Lee,"Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  This TV has great, crisp picture quality but whenever the picture start to move things go horribly wrong. The motion areas go blurry and sometimes the pixels go gray entirely. It's a very odd effect and very noticeable. For example when I'm watching The Office, whenever the camera pans around the room the screen gets pixelated or turns gray nearly every time and sometimes freezes up in the problem areas.I'm not exactly sure this is a defect. This seems like Samsung cheaped out on the internals of this TV and it shows - the overall OS is very clunky, and the TV takes a lot longer to respond to remote input than other models I've owned.To top it off the remote is defective - the volume button isn't set properly and wobbles when I toggle it.This TV is being returned.

  l love this TV. It works great and was easy to install. I read a lot of reviews and a couple were saying l would need to buy special screws to mount it because the shape. In preparation, l bought all of the advised screws when l ordered the tv and they went to waste. The TV is flat except for the very edges. See pics. Maybe it was because my TV is 65"" and perhaps theirs was smaller, causing the edges to interfere more? Or could it be the mount they chose? I suggest getting a mount that doesn't cover the back like a wall, but leaves the back accessible to get to the HDMI and USB sockets, especially if you are buying a smaller size. After researching for a month before buying, l got the mount EGLF2-BK with it and it worked great.  The sound works much better than my last tv and l don't see any sense in buying a soundbar. Also, l still like my Roku stick better than the smart tv software. Maybe that is just out of habit and l don't find the Alexa voice command so helpful, since l am already holding the remote and could easier press the button than speak into it. Still 5 stars. I am very satisfied with this purchase.

  This is absolutely an upgrade in picture for me.  i find that with external devices the sound often needs to be up around 50.  The interface takes a little time to get used to and you needed to sign up for Samsung account during set up.  Plan on an hour or better if your mounting it to the wall and powering the device up and updating any software required.  Its advisable to have all the additional accounts ready you want to link (amazon, netflix, etc) and doing this right off.  So far i am very happy with the overall experience and for the price of under $400 there is not a lot to be unhappy with.  Maybe the remote that is very basic but hey that is where having the dish remote works just fine.

  We decided to buy a smaller set so that it didn't overwhelm the room. Too many times, I've seen sets that you can't avoid seeing, and they aren't even on. The 55"" turned out to be somewhat underwhelming. If I could do it again, a 65"" would be as much as I would want. But the picture is magnificent! The remote works well, as long as you have small fingers. And one more complaint; there are not enough HDMI ports. 2 is not enough. I had to buy an additional 2 ports. It was very easy to set up and we were watching television within 15 minutes. All things considered, it is a good television set.

  The picture quality is good, the guys from Amazon that delivered it were good, the Smart features are not that smart. I got a TV with Alexa built in thinking it would be better, it is not. If it is in Netflix it is hit or miss if it will go to a TV channel, on the cable box. Sometimes when telling it to change the channel it knows what channel to go to, but drops a digit so instead of going to channel 757 it goes to 57 or instead of 618 it goes to 18. The setup is just as unfriendly as the earlier Series 7 for setting up the cable box. The cable box was in sleep mode, but there was no warning when going through the setup and it skips it without telling you. Adding the cable box manually after is not easy to do and easier just to reset the TV to factory defaults and start over once the cable box is out of sleep mode. Also the remote control itself is less usable than the older remote controls from Samsung, it looks more futuristic but needs more buttons to be put back for when the smart features fail (like not being smart enough to bring up the guide on the cable box). I have more complaints than this, but I figure this is enough to get the point across

  Pros: - Decent picture quality. Not amazing but it does do the - Huge plus on the remote. Other than the already preset buttons for ""Samsung tv plus"" which I don't use, the controller is simple, ergonomic, and slim.- okay sound qualityCons- bird feet- The smart OS is not very user friendly. You cannot customize the menu at all, so whenever you go to 'home' its just a bunch of preset list of movies that they are forcing you to buy. You cannot customize it to only show the apps you own (Netflix, Hulu, etc.) and you cannot uninstall the preset apps which are quite a few. To access the apps you set as favorite you have to press the home button and they are the tiniest of squares compared to the movies they are forcing you to see.If you do not mind the cons, then it is a decent purchase.

  Samsung should be ashamed of themselves for having a remote control but you cannot take the battery cover off of without using a screwdriver. It’s not designed to use a screwdriver but that’s the only way that you can get the cover off because it is locked in so well that it will not come off. I am reasonably strong and I’ve been going at this for 20 minutes so far. Pushing cover in the direction of the arrow just DOES NOT WORK.

  This is the 3rd Samsung Smart TV I have recently purchased as we focused on upgrading things during this pandemic. I like the TV overall but slightly less then my other two due to a few annoying items. First I can for the life of me not remove an unwanted app from Smart Hub menu. Easy on the other 2 but just cant seem to do it on this one. There is also sometimes a small delay when performing remote control actions. Minor stuff but enough for to rate this 4 and instead of 5 stars. I might update this later. Overall a nice TV and the 43 inch size is perfect in our bedroom.UPDATE: I'm now able to remove an app from the Smart Hub launcher but it is a slightly different action then with my other Samsung TV due to it being a 2020 version. I called Samsung support and they were extremely helpful. This however was not noted anywhere in the manual. Remote works better but still sometimes delayed.  Sound quality on this TV is poorer than on my 55 and 49 inch Samsung so I will likely get a soundbar or other external source for better sound. Still a solid TV, keeping this at 4 stars.

  The box and packaging are well designed. The TV was well-packaged with solid styrofoam to hold it securely in place, and adhesive strips to prevent damage to the screen when moving the TV.  The instructions were easy to follow and there was minimal assembly required. The form factor is slender and the unit itself is very attractive.  The remote is another useless 'smart' remote that replaces standard menu and navigation buttons with a very slimmed down selection and greatly encourages voice commands. I'm not a fan of it.  When powered on, the TV had multiple jagged lines that flickered beneath the perfectly intact screen and it never displayed a picture. I've never seen a TV so broken out of the box in my life. There is no way that this was a working unit before it went into the box and the packaging was so meticulous that the box would have been ripped in half before the TV could have been damaged like this in transit. Since it was clearly not a problem with the box or packaging, the only logical conclusion is that the shipping company was not to blame, and the manufacturer sent the TV out in this condition.  Unfortunately, Amazon does not have the delivery service verify whether a unit is working, and there is no recourse for a broken unit except to schedule another delivery, and take another day off work waiting for the delivery service to come back.  The lack of quality control calls into question what might be wrong with a 'working' unit, so I've scheduled a return of the unit for a refund.

Second, there is a button on the remote that makes no sense being there- it’s a number/color function that you can use to enter numbers, but then you also have a keyboard option that you can enter numbers with - either way you’re scrolling through numbers. Finally- and this is the BIGGEST headache when it comes to this tv- every time it’s turned off it disconnects from your internet and the only way to reconnect is to reset your internet access on the tv. Samsung is NO help, and any search on the internet will only find you others with the same problem and no solution.

A good friend came over and set  everything up for me and I can't stop smiling! 😁This is a fantastic buy and well worth the price! I need a new stand because the  stand  I had for my other television is not large enough for this  one! I will recommend this television to all of my friends and neighbors! Sorry I don't know how to include a picture! 🤗🤗

    Excellent Excellent Picture, Good Smart Apps, but Remote Control from Hell
  
",4.0 ,Neil Benson,"Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  My wife and I were very pleased with the quality of the picture which was significantly better than our previous HD one. The remote control could be best described as ""primitive."" Perhaps, by installing Alexa, which we haven't done, problems with the remote control could be bypassed. We shall see. A better introductory manual would have been useful in navigating the options within the software. For example, we had to learn by trial and error that the controls to closed captions were different for Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, etc. The ability to go to Google within the software is a plus.  Moving around the software with the remote control can be tricky. Sometimes, it's not clear where you are. I would recommend this Samsung TV with the caveats regarding the remote control.

  I’ve done my research on about 5 different tv’s and models. This one by far was the better tv for the price. The picture quality is really clear and the crisp. I tried watching a few movies that had a lot of CGI in it, ie: Black Panther, Avengers movies, and I’m amazed by the color and picture quality. I am very satisfied with my purchase and I would definitely buy this tv again if I need one for my other rooms.

  Easy to set up, excellent picture, nice sound, superb selection of OTA channels and streaming apps through its internal Amazon Fire set up. It takes a day or two to get used to the Amazon Fire styled remote control. The physical design of the ""case"" (not referring to the buttons) is too smooth surfaced and too rounded, so it easily slips out of the hand, and it doesn't balance in the hand during natural use. I give the remote's ""case"" design a D+. The button design and layout is a B+. The TV is a straight ""A"".

    MAJOR WARNING BEFORE YOU BUY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

  ORIGINAL POSTED ISSUE:Bought this TV in September 2020, we had a smaller version of the same unit in another room and we loved it.  The new 65"" had immediate light leak/clouding issues in the upper left quadrant and has since been spreading to the rest of the TV.  We opened a ticket with Samsung and they sent out technicians to diagnose the problem.  They told us we'd likely need a screen replacement or unit replacement but that ""some clouding is normal.""  We politely awaited the next step, which was a repair visit.  ...And then Samsung CLOSED the ticket.  When we asked why, they said the technicians noted in their report that we were unhappy but the TV was ""up to specs"" and that the ""repairs had been made.""  Samsung has refused to do anything but set up another technician visit to start the process all over again.  This has gone on for weeks.  We're taking it up with amazon as well.  BEWARE THIS - you are GAMBLING when you purchase a Samsung unit and their customer service is terrible.UPDATE:Since posting the above I contacted Amazon customer service and was thrilled with them.  They contacted Samsung on my behalf to confirm all I stated below.  And when Samsung still insisted upon starting over with their process -- Amazon stepped in to secure me a replacement set.  The new set arrived within 2 days and unfortunately -- it has a very similar issue to the previous one, only not quite as bad.  Still, a brand new factory set that does not warn of cloudy, diffused patches and light seepage along the frame is NOT a set anyone is going to want.  Unfortunately we now must attempt to return for a refund.Again buyer beware.  We've had good sets from Samsung in the past but we got two lemons in a row and their customer service was downright deceitful.  Thankful we at least bought on Amazon where they look out for buyers.

  My husband and I were ready to replace our very old hand-me-down TV, and were looking for a smart TV on a budget to fit in our small apartment. This tv from Samsung is just what we were hoping for! Great price, the picture is really lovely and the sound quality is great for our apartment, with no need for a soundbar. We purchased a ROKU at the same time, but it turns out that this smart TV has all of the channels/apps that we use, so we actually don't need a ROKU at all.Set up was super easy for me to do on my own.My only complaint is the remote - I find the volume and channel buttons are kind of poorly designed and not exactly intuitive. But this is a super small problem for us, so not much to be concerned about.

  Considering how much I paid, I am happy with the picture quality and the features except for the Samsung's Smart TV interface.  I consider it to be unpolished and confusing.  And the number one thing I wanted in a smart TV - the ability to play music and music videos on YouTube hands-free with Alexa - doesn't work with YouTube on this TV and I've put a couple of hours into troubleshooting it to no avail.  Whatever music I search Alexa will only launch it on Amazon Music.  My friend's Toshiba smart TV based on Android doesn't have that problem, Alexa works like a champ on YouTube.I'm going to keep the TV but most likely buy a Fire Stick HD for $40 to use in place of the Samsung Tizen OS and simply write off the Samsung smart TV interface.

  We took this TV out of the box and the only issue we had is we tried to put the feet in wrong, but that was soon cleared up.

To be fair, we skipped all of the options to load Alexa and Smart Things and Apps, figuring we would do that if an when we wanted them.  We did follow the advice of another reviewer and we were careful to make sure we didn't load ads (there is one step of the process that asks your permission to access your data and you have to unselect Say Yes to All and specifically leave off Targeted Ad content). The picture quality, the sound, and the ease of use were all very good.  We didn't seem to have the trouble that other people had with the remote, but it isn't my favorite designed piece of hardware.  We use the DISH remote anyway and we quickly got it to recognize the TV so we only use one remote.  I would order this TV again in a heartbeat.

  Let's start with the main part - this is an incredible tv at a good value. The image is crisp, the colors are vibrant, and it is a pleasure to watch movies, shows, and games on this tv. The annoying lack of control over what is on the selection bar when changing from one source to another (live TV, Hulu, Netflix, etc). I'm stuck sorting through sources I don't have or want because the Smart Hub is locked. I can add, but cannot delete or move around the ones they insist that must be on the hub.

  This was purchased directly from Amazon as a new unit. The unit I received upon gloved unboxing was a used unit. There was a visible hand print on the screen and deep scuff marks and gouges on the back of the unit. There was no visible damage to the box upon delivery.This has made me loose faith in Samsung and Amazon. Not only was this unit used and sold as new, but this makes the third time I have purchased a Samsung tv that came with some sort of physical or electronic defect. Poor quality control.This unit, aside from the physical damage upon inspection works well, has a decent picture for its price point and the menu responds well though going to detailed settings is a touch laggy but not terrible.Ultimately this was a lackluster purchase due to the used and damaged nature of this new tv upon arrival.

    Perhaps I got a Lemon, But there are many flaws in this unit - some are usability issues
  
",2.0 ,Mr. Amusing,"Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2021","









  
  
    
  I don't know which is more to blame, the TV, or the SAMSUNG HW-T450 2.1ch Soundbar with Dolby Audio (2020) (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B085WTFCQ7) that I got to pair it with. But it has a serious flaw with audio.I've described the flaw in more detail in my review of the soundbar.  Bottom line is every 30-60 minutes the audio goes completely off, the ""D-In"" light flashes on the sound bar, then the sound comes back a second or two later, often at a lower volume than before it went off. This despite being connected to the soundbar with a digital optical cable that came with the soundbar unit.  I have spent a dozen hours hunting for a solution and have found none. I'm about ready to toss the Soundbar out... since it is past my return window.  The problem seems to occur no matter what the source is... whether streaming through Fire Cube TV, or directly from an App in the TV.  Note that my TV and my Fire Cube have direct ethernet connections, so there is no problem related to WiFi. Also, if I turn off the sound bar and use the tinny, tiny speaker in the TV, it doesn't lose audio. And if you end up with some volume on both the TV and the Soundbar... chances are very good that they will be OUT OF SYNC.  In short, two Samsung products do not play well together.Our previous TV was an LG.  The smartOS on the LG TV was a nightmare to operate, on the Samsung, the TV is much more navigable, except they seem to insist on having their ""advertisement"" as a necessary, and unavoidable / unremovable thing you must ALWAYS skip over to get to the settings.  This isn't really a surprise, Samsung cell phones are loaded with similar unremovable, unwelcome junk.While you can enable Alexa (and/or Google) on the TV, you'll be sorry if you do.  You get much more, and much more accurate control via an ""Echo Dot"" or better, a Fire Cube TV (the Fire Cube is far from ideal, too, by the way)The good news is... you can add the apps for eg. Netflix and HBOMax directly to the TV. This is nice if you don't have Fire TV, and it works. But you'll undoubtedly find it much easier to use the Fire TV controls/remote than to try to use the one that comes with the TV - assuming you pick up the right remote!Unfortunately, the Soundbar remote and the TV remote are nearly indistinguishable. The TV remote has 4 more small buttons, but the extra 4 buttons on TV remote are really, really useless.On my TV remote, you have ""Netflix, Amazon Prime, Samsung Plus TV"" - three direct streaming channels that you cannot change.  It also has a silly ""color mode"" button that I can't imagine ANYONE would ever find useful on the remote... but the TV Remote lacks a ""Go to Settings"" button.  Geez, even the LG tv had such a feature.If you want to change the subwoofer volume or the sound mode, you'll need to find the soundbar remote.  If you want to control the soundbar volume, it appears you need the soundbar remote - which has a prominent mute button whereas the TV remote does NOT have a mute button (Hint, it actually does, but it's really non-intuitive - it's certainly not labeled - which again is why I find the Fire Cube remote to be MUCH better overall.)Picture quality has been good, but doesn't seem better (in fact doesn't seem to be as good as the elderly 4K LG TV that it replaced). It's hard to say how much of the problem is due to bandwidth limitations in streaming vs TV cleverness... I haven't reconnected my over-the-air antenna which is where the LG was very noticeably sharp.Lastly, while Samsung products are generally good quality, their huge land grab at gathering personal information rankles me. I'm not a fan of sending my personal information to a Korean company that seems more interested in selling me things (and selling my personal information) than in providing a quality product and quality service.

The user menu seems like there is some sort of delay when switching through the apps. I’ve had issues with the WiFi connecting to the tv. A few of the apps wouldn’t connect/load, one of them being Netflix and the other one was the spectrum app. The picture quality isn’t as nice as it is on the 2019 model.

  Ordered one while they were on sale and when it came, we were excited because it looked good, no damage, good picture, and worked nicely.... for half a day. We probably used it for a total of 5 hours before turning it off to go to bed and the next day it would not turn on. The screen stayed black and would flash every few minutes. We contacted customer support & they gave the option of sending a replacement or refund so we chose to replace it. A few weeks later we received the replacement & from the beginning I felt there would be an issue because the delivery driver delivered it upside down on our concrete porch. When we finally opened it, the screen was noticeably damaged and was pretty much coming apart from the top. I contacted customer support again and chose a refund this time because we are tired of receiving TVs that some of their workers clearly do not care about and handle VERY carelessly.The only reason they received a few stars was because customer support was easy to reach & handled everything without giving us a headache, which I very much appreciated.I would definitely not recommend purchasing only because you have no way of knowing how the warehouse workers/delivery drivers handle these items until you finally receive it only to have to put it back in the box moments later.

    It's a great TV... but two features critical to me were failures
  
",1.0 ,Norman B. Bernstein,"Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2021","









  
  
    
  I have been a big Samsung TV fan for quite some time, and my home has 5 Samsung flat screen TV's bought over the last 6 or 7 years. I bought this 65"" model because I wanted a bigger screen in my den, and wanted to give my daughter the 55"" Samsung it was intended to replace.However, there were two features of the TV that were critical... to me, if not to all that many other people. First, I wanted to upgrade because my older 55"" model didn't have Bluetooth and support wireless earbuds (which I must wear, to avoid conflicts with my wife, who watches in an adjacent room). Secondly, I am a big collector of movies and TV shows, and they're all stored on an external 2Tb hard disk, which I plug into the TV. The older 55"" model handled the hard disk beautifully.I was soon to be VERY disappointed.First, the Bluetooth support for wireless earbuds is a joke.... if it works at all, it's not only intermittent, but the TV doesn't support the volume control when using earbuds, and the loudness is pitiful. I tried using the earbuds (one of Sony's latest models) with a different Samsung TV with Bluetooth, and the story was the same: no volume control, and the loudness was so soft, it was useless.The more important failure, however, was the support for the external hard disk. While the much older 55"" TV I had been using supported the external hard disk without any difficulties, this new one failed to play over half of my stored videos, showing a 'not supported' error message. A bit more digging revealed that this new TV doesn't support some of the common codecs used for video files, like DivX.I may have found the reason, however. This latest Samsung TV employs an Android-based operating system called 'Tizen'... something which is not shown on the literature for Samsung TV's from last year or the years before. It is surprising, because the user control structure on-screen is exactly the same as it was before 'Tizen'... but clearly, there are differences.I resolved my problem by swapping my TV for my wife's. Hers was a 55"" Samsung from 2019, and it supports the hard disk beautifully (although it has the same useless Bluetooth support for earbuds). Since she doesn't use the hard disk of Bluetooth features, she's fine with the new one.I, of course, lost the nice 65"" screen... but, at least, I can play my library of movies.For most people, this TV would be great; a really good screen image, for a reasonable price.......just not for me.

  What's the point in a smart TV if it's not very smart? YouTube was quality limited, ads are enforced (the worst is that if you don't interact for ~60 seconds when not playing, it closes your app and shows ads!). The Crunchyroll app was removed because Samsung sucks. I'd return this piece of junk, but am going to test a FireStick with it first. Good TV -- terrible smart TV.

    I’m sticking to QLED if I can
  
",4.0 ,Jesus Aguilera,"Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2021","









  
  
    
  Package arrived without any signs of damage in the usual 2 day shipping. Setup is a breeze, especially since I own several Samsung TVs and the process is the same as QLEDs of the same year range. To my dismay, I could not easily assign apps the home bar! On the other TVs you can tap up on the app, then select add to home and it pops right there. I had to go to the app manager and add them there. I found this slightly annoying. The home bar also did not let me arrange my apps in the desired order. Overall a bit frustrating over the QLED counterparts. I don’t know if there is an update to install but I will check. After I set up the TV, I notice purple areas when the TV displays blacks. This really bothered me! It looks like a pattern of dots and a line. Maybe screws tightened too much at the assembly process that damaged the display? I want to send back but every other color that is not black shows very well. I don’t know how much of a hassle it would be to return but my wife told me to let it go. She doesn’t mind it one bit. I will try to add update if possible.

  It does have a good picture, and we can access Netflix, Prime and YouTube.  BUT no other peripheral (DVD player, Dish Network, composite player) works at all.  I called Samsung tech support who said, ""Not our problem.  It must be the peripherals.""  I pointed out all were working fine on the old TV.  Her reaction was basically ""So?""I have never had these problems with any TV before.  And really why should I?  Why isn't it plug and play?I'll have to get a computer expert I know to try to make it work.  That should not be necessary.I expected far better from Samsung and a TV that cost $500.Part 2:  With the help of a computer pro, we finally got it to work. But it took him two hours.It's the opposite of user friendly.  Calling Samsung was not helpful.  They said since our peripherals are not made by Samsung, they couldn't help to make them work with the TV.Now, after hours of effort by me and the computer pro, it finally works.  The layout of the screens are confusing to say the least.If you want an easy-to-use TV, this isn't it.

  First, the remote has limited capability without scrolling through a bunch of options,  and while doing that you're forced to watch ads that you apparently can't turn off.  Second, at least on the 65"" model, the four mounting bolts are m9, which are very difficult to find.  Perhaps they come with some mounts, but they didn't with the separate mount I got on Amazon, and the mount I got wouldn't accommodate m9 bolts even if I had them.  I decided just to send everything back to Amazon.

  Pros are the software is user friendly and responsive. I also really like all the preloaded apps. What I don’t like is the picture quality and brightness. I unfortunately had to replace my previous Samsung tv (which I loved) Model number UN40KU6290. The picture was far superior to the this new one.  I am so disappointed with the picture quality compared to my last one. The viewing angle is also very limited. When I first turned it on I thought maybe it was just a setting, but I now realize that this tv just doesn’t have enough lighting. Also the edges appear to be dimmer than the rest of the picture. I don’t recommend this tv unless you will be viewing it straight on and in a dark room.

  This is a beautiful television. I bought a 50"" with the T4sound bar and back speakers and I love it, but be aware. You're not going to unpack and connect everything and have it work. The manuals it comes with are brief and help, but they're not enough by themselves. Immediately register everything and create a Samsung ID. Your eMail address. Suddenly the people at SamsungTV are fantastic. There's an eManual 105 pages long. Read it. People who don't like this television clearly haven't taken the time to learn it. The remotes aren't cryptic. Again, learn them. The TV will explain your remotes, how to operate your TV. It detected my home computer, my phone. I have been extremely impressed with everything about it and the Samsung people. For $400 (without the sound bar) it's a hell of a television. Trim, almost no bezel. I'd buy another one in a second. Extremely satisfied. The people who write bad reviews for this television probably work for competitors and wish they worked for Samsung. The television comes with free ""SamsungTV"" tons of add on apps. I love it.

  This is a pretty solid set for the price--fantastic display when configured correctly and easy navigation with the updated remote. Had to return it because of a major annoying factor: the video was consistently ahead of the audio by about .5 MS. This made any cable/streaming/Blu-Ray like a badly dubbed movie.Typically if the audio is ahead of the video this isn't an issue as you can just configure a delay on the soundbar or set. Unfortunately, you can't if the video is ahead of the audio. Need to work on the basics Samsung!

  This smart TV does not stay connected to the internet.  (Yes, I have checked my connection, my internet is fine! We did all the updates to the TV, etc.)  Every time we turn the TV off it disconnects from the network.  In order for it to reconnect you have to unplug the TV from the wall and plug it back in, then it connects right back to the network.  Who wants to have to unplug their TV every time they want to watch it?  So essentially it is a dumb TV.  I am not returning it because who wants to deal with the hassle of boxing up a 75"" TV to have it returned?  So if you still decide to purchase this TV ensure you have a Roku or some other streaming device hooked up to it.  Also consider purchasing through Best Buy or Walmart, at least you can go to the brick and mortar store if you have to.  Overall very disappointed with this TV.

",5.0 ,Jeff,"Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have had this TV for 10 days now and I wanted to share my feelings on the positives, negatives, and overall traits. I did extensive research on Youtube and Amazon before landing on this one. I was moving up from a 60"" plasma Samsung which I was moving into my living room, to replace a 42"" Panasonic plasma which I am moving outdoors to my patio. I've owned several Samsung TVs. Here are my thoughts:Positives: - Great packaging. The box has a ""pull off top"" that allows you to expose the TV while it is standing upright and easily get your hands under it to lift if straight out. There was plenty of styrofoam and the screen and TV overall were clean and devoid of scratches or cracks. - Delivery. I paid the extra few dollars for ""delivery to any room"" and the delivery team took it straight to my home theatre in the basement. Both were very nice and wearing masks and arrived on time. - 4K picture. I have watched hours of 4K content on Youtube to test the color, dynamic range, etc. It's brilliant! Really blew me away. I would recommend (after making this mistake myself) to not get too wrapped up in all the comparisons and little distractions brought up in various Youtube videos. The reality is a 2020 Samsung 4K TV is going to look pretty amazing. The reviewers get down into crazy details that the average person just won't notice. - Setup. The setup for the remote, Smart TV options, etc, was SUPER easy. It automatically paired to the Samsung sound bar I also bought, and also automatically connected to my cable TV box (Spectrum) and the setup of Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video was done in minutes.Negatives and Annoyances: - The remote kinda sucks. It is very small (same size as an Amazon Fire TV remote) and has minimal buttons. I've learned to use it just fine, but I really don't understand this dumb concept of ""minimalist"" TV remotes. If you are using the remote in a dark media room, it's basically impossible to see the buttons. And the remote has no backlite or glow-in-the-dark features. Also, the volume and channel buttons are narrow little toggles that you click literally forward/backward instead of just pressing up or down. Really, just stupid design. Not a dealbreaker, but terrible nonetheless. ALSO, the soundbar remote is basically IDENTICAL, but without channel or Home options. I can't tell you how many times I grab the wrong remote in the dark. Overall, the remote sucks. - SOAP OPERA EFFECT ENABLED OUT OF THE BOX - Disable this! It ruins 4K movies! You can do your own research on this topic, but bottom line, this TV (like many competitors) automatically enables ""motion smoothing technology"" which might be OK for sports, but RUINS real 4K movies. But don't despair! Just disable LED Clear Motion in the Expert Settings, and the problem is solved. - Sound. The soundbar also, for whatever dumb reason, comes set up with ""sound delay"" which means moving mouths do not match the sound. This is also an option you can fix easily in Expert Settings, but again, so stupid for it to be enabled. It should not even be an option in my opinion.Overall: Really love it and would recommend. Note, I am not using it for gaming, just streaming movies and regular TV. Beautiful picture, easy setup, good packaging and delivery, and very easy-to-use smart TV options. I would definitely buy it again!

  Please, do not purchase this TV. This is not a quality purchase for $500. I really liked this TV in the beginning when I purchased it back in June. I did not notice the banding and pixelation issues in the first few months. Unfortunately, this TV suffers from serious Banding, Dithering and pixelation issues, especially when watching darker content or most videos that are encoded in 1080p look horrible. Even 4K content suffers immensely due to the lack of brightness and the limited calibration menu of this TV. The preset picture modes are a Joke and don’t really allow you to tune much of the picture quality. I feel Samsung is just using their name to sell these lower end TV models like the TU7000 and TU8000. They want you to spend thousands on the high end 8k resolution TV’s or Q series QLED TV models and have purposely handicapped there lower end TV models for 2020. There are MUCH better options out there than this garbage like the Hisense H9 series or the TCL series 6 if you are on a budget. The Sony x900 series TV’s are probably the best for the money but a tad expensive around $1000. Please do.

If you look at the specs for this tv on the Samsung website and check the frame rate, it SAYS 120, however if you do a little more research you will come to find that the number they put on the website is a made up number based on some crap feature they put in this tv. It’s actually 60fps and NOT true 4K. I got this TV FOR TRUE 4K gaming, and I was deceived by a gimmick. Next tv I buy will NOT be Samsung. They just lost a lifetime customer.

  The sound quality is terrible. No adjustments help.  But this is what I was prepared for.  But several downsides I did not sign up for at all.The remote operation is chunky with unreliable response time. You press a button and wait a little, then you press some other buttons. Then all of a sudden all those button press actions come into life.The apps are displayed in a small size perhaps to fit many on the screen, but I like them to look bigger, I am fine with having to scroll a little more. There is no way to adjust this. You can try to increase the size, but all it does is increase the text font, not the icon size.The microphone on the remote is not the best quality. A little ambient sound will throw off the voice string, regardless.what you are using , alexa or Google assistant.I should have kept the bravia I had, which was smaller in size, and no voice search. But this new tv provides no effective upgrade.

  You will have to turn the TV off and reset your router and reconnect every single time you want to use it. TV Is right next to the router and has obstructive line of sight between it. So it’s not a connectivity issue. Works fine once you do that but it’s basically a five minute start up time every time I wanna watch TV. If I could return it I would in a heartbeat.

  I got the 65” tv and I’m very satisfied! When you research tvs one of the first things you learn is that they measure the screen DIAGONALLY. My tv in reality is about 58” when i just measured it, which is the length listed in the product details (which i hope ppl would read before buying a whole tv off the internet, but some of the reviews prove otherwise haha)The TV came in a huge box straight to my apartment door, packaged rather thinly but there was no damage to the TV. I plugged it into the wall and the setup took like 10mins but I skipped on a bunch of the set up since it was mostly stuff that isn’t necessary for my streaming apps (I don’t use cable) The TV volume is great too, i keep it around 20-25 to watch from my couch which is 8-10ft away.I use this TV mostly at night to watch movies on netflix/amazon prime and it works perfect for that. I’ve also watched some 4k youtube videos which look great. There are some slight issues like the black not being a true black but I watch TV rather casually so it doesn’t bother me (especially at the price point) My fiancé has used it a few times for his ps4 to play simple games like fall guys and it connected without any issues.I don’t know how it works for cable but if you’re just using it for streaming apps/casual game play with friends this is a GREAT tv!! highly recommend

  Love this TV. Lots to rave about here. Firstly, it's super light weight - 18lbs. Not too big for small spaces and easy to move around. Also super easy to set up providing you have an updated router.  You may have to buy a new one like I did - TPLink AC1750 (I recommend this one.) Once you have that, your streaming services will be a piece of cake.  In addition there are literally hundreds of free channels with just about every topic covered running 24/7. The remote is super simple with very few buttons to push but covers everything you needs to access on your tv.  I haven't tried to voice activation and don't really need it.  Otherwise I am very happy with the Samsung which is also a favorite of one of my sisters.

  The picture on this TV is very bright and crisp. It has good sound quality as well. if you are using it in conjunction with a hub of some sort, it is perfect. My issues lie with the TV's user interface. The TV defaults to a limited number of very random channels when it is turned on, rather than some sort of menu like on a Roku TV. Every time I turn it on, it's some show about fishing, then I have to hit a few buttons to change the input. The menu itself is a pop up menu at the bottom of the screen that gives you limited options. Overall it takes a frustrating amount of time to get to what you actually want to watch. There is also an ambience mode included as a button on the remote that does absolutely nothing but interrupt your programming when you accidentally press the ambience mode button. Overall, the hardware is good, but the software is shockingly bad.

",2.0 ,LightningMike,"Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2020","









  
  
    
  I got this TV a few days ago, bought it from Amazon, it arrived a day earlier than expected. Very satisfied with most aspects of the TV but at this time I can only give it two (2) stars.  Here's my Pro/Con opinion:Pro's - Beautiful picture, plenty of options to manipulate the picture to suit your taste and room lighting. TV is nice and thin, its wall hung in our master bedroom and I used a very compact Monoprice mount that tucks it tight against the wall. Sound is decent with options, pickup of home wifi signal was instantaneous. The remote is very similar to my Amazon Firestick 4K so its easy to use.Con's - Samsung builds in some preset Apps like ""Samsung+FreeTV"" and ""Samsung Health"" that could be nice to have, but rather than being able to move them out of the preset area over with the other Apps like HGTV or Hulu or YouTube, it seems they are locked and whenever you turn on the TV, one of them is selected. My provider is YouTubeTV and I would like the TV to power on showing the YouTubeTV Guide with its 40-50 channels. I can't seem to make that happen, and I was on the phone with a Samsung ""Technician"" who admitted he didn't know much about setting up the Home Bar. This set also says ""Alexa is built-in"" which is true, but it seems its a limited Alexa? I press the microphone button and ask ""Alexa, switch to YouTubeTV"" and the YouTube logo appears, not the YouTubeTV logo. If I ask to switch to MSNBC, Alexa gives me a wikipedia explanation of the origins of MSNBC, NBC, and the parent company.I'd like to like this TV FIVE (5) stars worth, but until I can get someone to explain how to use the features I paid for, its just another basic Samsung TV with WiFi. I could've bought a cheaper model and probably had the same picture quality. I will come back and re-evaluate if I can get it working as advertised.

  Our old Samsung (10+ years) failed with a streak of dead pixels across the screen. I ordered this one and cannot be more pleased with it, especially at this price point.Pros:- Easy to setup (wi-fi, apps, etc.)- Great value - 4k and good quality picture.- Screen glare: I saw a few reviews talking about this but honestly have not experienced a problem. We have two windows where light hit the tv as well as a ceiling light very close to it and when we mounted it on our wall, we solved the problem by tilting it a bit down. Day or night time viewing looks great!Neutral:- Smart settings on TV: I hardly use them as I just do everything from my Fire Tv.- Voice control was seems to work fine at times but others not so much.Cons:- While the picture quality is good I had to fiddle with the settings to get it to look just right.- The speakers on this tv do not fill the room. You'll need to really up the volume for certain movies (or output the sound by other devices)

Use roku, too bad, pay for cable too bad, use your tv for gaming, too bad, every single time you turn this thing on you’re gonna be watching some low budget lifetime flick on Samsung tv.3. It’s loaded with ads/garbage from their partners. In addition to only opening into the Samsung sponsored Tv service, the apps available for download are limited, difficult to navigate because of their Home Screen design, and the weird Samsung sponsored ads are always listed first, you have to scroll past their garbage to get to your most frequently used/preferred apps.

  I really enjoy Samsung TV products. I do own other TVs outside of this brand though. I ordered this TV based on a lightning deal and do not regret it. While setting this up, I kept getting a prompt to download a specific Samsung app for ease of use and set up. I’m not a fan of having to add an app just for ease of use. Regardless, you can skip this step.Setting up Disney+ Netflix & Prime allows you to go and add a code on their respective websites to simplify authorization. Vudu was an actual username and password. Regardless, it was almost a seamless experience for connecting these apps.What I don’t like, terms of use seem invasive and will almost render TV useless if not accepted. While remote is simple, it’s almost sluggish as there is no input option unless you hit the home button and select input. There are also a few proprietary apps that you cannot remove like FB. I do hope that a future update allows for removal of what I consider junk apps.Edit 1: no need for tools, legs snap in along with cable holder.

  So this will be a very mixed review due to one major flaw in this TV. Starting with the positive aspects, the picture quality is incredible. Controls are very intuitive and lots of the apps are great. The major issue is the 107 error code. Seems to be a flaw in the firmware where the wireless disconnects constantly. Samsung will always blame your wifi but its not the case. It can be very frustrating since the TV becomes useless until you reset or use an ethernet cable.

  First, yes, I disabled the power saving features and did everything possible to turn the brightness to its max. This TV is unwatchably dark. Forget complaining about daytime watching. You can't even watch it at night with a dim lamp running in the same room. I am honestly shocked there are not more complaints about this.I would almost assume I got a defective TV, but I am pretty sure the issue is in software. When testing with a laptop or AirPlay image it gets about as bright as expected (not amazing, but fine). The issue happens when watching HDR content (which is nearly everything these days). Everything but the brightest scenes disappear into the shadows. The TV doesn't have the ability to push HDR on the bright side, so I guess instead they give you that high dynamic range my making low to mid lights very dark.Really a shame because it is otherwise a fantastic value TV. Great feature set for the price, great image quality (if watching in a pitch black room) smart features are smooth and easy to use, sound is clear and impressive for built-in speakers. I am debating if I will keep it or return.

    MUST READ! Do NOT buy this TV if you want high quality! You get what you pay for!
  
",1.0 ,Carl and Veronica,"Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2020","Wake Up Amazon Customers! You Get What You Pay For!

I know that you did not think you that were going to get $3,000 value in a $500 TV. Because the reality is that I thought that was going to happen unfortunately.

I personally think that Samsung is the best brand in TV. That's why I was so excited to see an affordable TV made by Samsung. I thought that I was going to get ""Samsung Quality"" from a $500 TV. And, unfortunately, I was wrong.

I thought that ""any TV Samsung made was Samsung quality regardless of the price."" And I found out that this was not true at all. I found out that Samsung is a ""get what you pay for"" company just like all of the other brands. In other words, if you pay $800-$1000 or more for a Samsung TV, you will get ""Samsung Quality"". But if you pay less than $500 for a Samsung TV, you will not get ""Samsung Quality"".

We need to realize that this is a ""$500 TV"". And even though it's coming from the best brand in the world, it's still just ""$500 value"". Don't let this TV fool you just because Samsung's name is on it. Even though Samsung's name is on it, you are still getting a $500 TV. And if you think about it, $500 TVs don't give you much value at all.

Below are the problems with this TV:
1. I don't recommend buying a TV online. You will get anxiety and worry about whether or not the TV will arrive to you broken due to shipping and handling. Also, when the TV came to my house, there was dirt and dust on the actual TV. Like I said, I don't recommend getting a TV online. You will worry too much about the shipping and handling, AND when you take it out the box, dirt and dust can be on the TV.

2. On this TV, the words people are saying can't keep up the movement of their mouth. In other words, there's a lag when people are speaking. The sound of the words come in 0.3-0.5 seconds late after the movement of the mouth.

3. Sometimes, when you turn it on live TV such as CNN, the TV ""hesitates"" before it get into natural motion of the live feed.

4. The game mode is no good at all. The game mode is too dark AND the 120hz refresh rate is NOT consistent. In other words, when you put it on game mode, it suppose to run games at 120hz like we gamers like it. However, it does not run it at 120hz for very fast moving objects. It will probably run at 120z for ""slow to medium speed"" objects. But when it comes to very fast moving objects, you can forget it. It will run fast moving objects at 60z with motion blur and judder. To put it simple, this TV can NOT run VERY FAST video game motion at 120hz. Period.

5. The sound for this TV is not good. You better get a soundbar if you want high quality sound.

6. The picture has POTENTIAL but it does not live up to it due to it being just $500 value. What I mean is that if you play around with the picture settings for like 2 days, you can actually get a very good picture. For example, I choose dynamic mode for my picture mode, and it was a very good picture. However, the problem is that even though the picture was good, it seems like the picture was not ""smooth"". It's hard to explain this part, but I hope you get what I'm saying. It seems like a $500 Samsung TV was trying its best to give you a ""high quality picture"" but it was struggling to do so. That's the best I can put it.

I don't recommend this TV. I recommend Samsung, but not this TV. I will get a refund for this TV and I will go to the local Walmart, invest more money, and get a better Samsung TV because this TV is not high quality.

If you want a high quality TV, you have to spend the money. Period. You have to spend at least $800-$1000 or more.

You will not get high quality from a $497 TV. I don't care whether it's from Samsung or not, you will not get high quality in a $500 TV. Period.

If you can't afford a TV above $500, and if you buy this TV, then good luck with it and I hope that you have a better experience than me and my family.

But, the bottom line is that YOU WILL NOT GET HIGH QUALITY IN A $500 TV. Period.

I have learned my lesson about TVs. Invest good money in a high quality one, and don'y buy one online.

Take care.

Huge Update on August 23, 2020:

This is an update because I'm trying to help you'll out.
In my original review, I said I was going to a local Walmart to get a high quality TV.

NEWS FLASH: WALMART DOES NOT SELL HIGH QUALITY TVs IN LOCAL STORES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

I just recently found this out.

You see, Walmart is basically is just about making profit. They bring in the cheapest products so they can make the most profit. This is how they bring in and sell TVs.

ALL OF THE TVs AT WALMART IS POOR QUALITY!

Yeah, they have the ""big names"" but they sell the LOWEST QUALITY TVs of those big brands.

So, even though I recommend buying a TV locally and offline in order to avoid shipping and handling stress, DO NOT GO TO WALMART! You will MOST DEFINITELY get the lowest quality there. GUARANTEED! Instead, try another retail such as Target, Best Buy, etc. BUT NOT WALMART!

Also, I understand some people prefer buying online or they NEED to buy online. For example, you might find a CAN'T MISS deal online or something. So, if you buy online, make sure that you buy from an online retail that has a no hassle refund/return policy, great shipping and handling, and a HIGH QUALITY TV!

And even though I don't recommend Walmart stores offline for TVs, if you want to buy online, Walmart does have high quality TVs online partially because 3rd party sellers put High Quality TVs on their website. And Walmart itself might throw you a bone with a high quality TV on their website if you look hard enough. BUT AVOID LOCAL WALMART STORES FOR TVs!

Take care!

Huge Update on August 27, 2020:

I no longer consider Samsung as the best company in TVs anymore. Therefore, they are no longer my favorite. I think they are a company to ""consider"" but Samsung is no longer my top choice.

The reason is because after having a bad experience with this TV, Samsung is simply not what they used to be. Samsung used to be a company that used to give ""NOTHING BUT HIGH QUALITY"".

But, as of now, they are making ""A LOT OF GARBAGE"" TVs.

Simply put, if you are not investing $1,500 or more in a Samsung, you are simply not going to get their best quality because they are saving their best quality for only TVs over $1,000 and they are making a lot of garbage TVs which costs under $1,000. And I think this is unfair to the customers in general.

You should look for a TV Brand that is making high quality TVs that is under $1,000 that includes the following:
1. 120 native refresh rate
2. Quantum Dot or better technology
3. Have the ability to cut off ""the soap opera effect"" with ease.
4. Have a dynamic game mode
5. Good quality build and good customer support.

    Picture is Samsung quality

  I've never owned a more complicated piece of equipment than this Samsung TV, and when I first started buying A/V toys, JFK was president. Yeah, I'm old. Set up was a joke. And you need to create an account with Samsung just to watch tv?? And the personal questions they had to ask?? Just to watch tv?? Gimme a break.In my opinion the remote sucks. Plain and simple. You have to scroll all over the place to get to anywhere. Whoever designed it obviously never tried to actually use the thing. Compared to all the remotes I've ever used, this one is by far the most complicated thing I've ever seen. And I've had a ton of remotes over the years. I have to use 4 remotes right now to run the tv, BluRay, Firestick and Denon receiver. I tried unsuccessfully three times last night to set it up to where I'd only have to use 3 remotes, but I'm back to having to use 4. smdhWhere I'm located Windstream is my only source, so I have Kinetic TV ran through the Firestick. I've got two Vizio tv's that have no problems at all using the Firestick, so it could be that Samsung just makes it difficult for those of us stuck with a hdmi cable and a chuck of plastic attached to it. When I went looking for the KineticTV app, I was sure it wasn't even listed. I finally found it after scrolling about 200 apps down. Now I have it loaded on my home screen, and only have to scroll through 10 others just to get to it. I'm hoping it's something I'm doing wrong and it could be. If someone out there knows if apps can be situated in a different order, please enlighten me.Having said all that, the picture quality of this tv is great. I've owned Samsung in the past, and there's something about a Samsung picture you just know when you see it. I was more than impressed with the picture. The thin bezel running around the perimeter is also a nice touch. And the tv sound is better than one might expect.Since the picture is the most important aspect of a television, I'll live with the complaints I made above and just deal with it. Not of my choosing, but really, it's not very user friendly at all. I'm sure over time I'll get more adjusted to it, and possibly learn a few tricks to simplify things. I've only had it 48 hours. Probably should've waited to write a review.The coolest part is when you turn it off or on. Buy one. You'll see what I mean.

  I have been using this tv for 2 months now. Here is my experience:There is annoying lag with the tv when using the remote. When scrolling through titles it will often freeze and you have to wait for it. This happens a lot.The remote has levers to push the volume/channels up and down and they are bothersome, you will accidently hit them. If you press down on the levers you will mute whatever you are watching and its easy to accidently do that when just trying to change the volume or channel.The remote also has some buttons at the top you will most likely never use. One of them is a ""ambient button""? Or something? All it does is shut off the tv? And the few times I tried to figure out what it did I had to unplug the tv to just get back to the regular main screens. No I didn't read the manual maybe its supposed to do something else... IDGAF.Besides all that the picture is good. Smart hub is fine. All I do is use the tv for streaming Netflix, hulu, prime and YouTube.

  After looking at a lot of TV's and reading reviews I finally got this Samsung TV. (It replaces a Sharp TV that the sound kept cutting out on needing turning the TV off for a minute and turning it back on, a known issue with Sharp, but no update.) The Samsung is great bang for back, although performance was also important.  It got better buyer reviews than most of the sets I was looking at, for a better price. Picture is good, sound is good. Set up with all the menus and smart functions to scroll through was a PITA, all I wanted was a TV to watch movies on. The remote control turns on complicated menus on TV that one needs to scroll through. It is not intuitive, one need to spend some time with a downloaded manual to learn how to use this TV I prefer quick buttons on remote.The instruction pamphlet included is very limited and one needs to download the full manual online. Once I did that and took the time to read up on the control functions things became clearer. I still prefer buttons than scrolling through functions.I have direct TV and wanted to set the DTV controller for this TV. Could not find a correct code at first. Direct TV gives the wrong code, and their code link is a blank page, seems to open their code list one needs to sign in first PITA looking for all the passwords, and whats the secret?. .  Finally I found and old print out with several codes and the last one worked. 10812, YMMV..Update: so after having this TV for a few weeks, its a second room TV.  I looked at the Samsung TV a few times and found the picture a bit flat not deep hue and vivid, especially faces. I went into picture settings set dynamic and than advanced, and adjusted there a bit. Got better than Standard setting, but my old Sony 1080 still has more depth and vivid colors. With all the functions this TV has I would have preferred  individual color control not a general color slider. I'll never use most of the other functions.

    Awful Bloatware
  
",2.0 ,,"Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2020","Hey Samsung: Stop with the bloatware.

This television looks like something they make fun of in comedy movies where someone goes to the future, and there are holographic ads everywhere that are constantly screaming at you and you can't see anything and you run into the walls because you're not used to all this spam. Turning on this television for the first time is hell for anyone who's not used to the modern advertising scene.

Setting up the TV was awful. The app couldn't connect to the TV, so we've already deleted the app. Thanks Samsung for wasting my time. We tried on 2 different phones, in a household where we regularly use our phones to connect to our Roku. When we finally set up the TV with the remote, Dear God.

Ads. So many ads. There was some sort of horrible music video playing, and the interface was trying to sell me movies, and there were a million apps, and I couldn't tell what the hell was going on because the remote isn't labeled and the interface is more worried about selling you stuff than being an interface.

I took these steps:

Find the channel list in the TV section. How you get there, good luck. But on the right side you can ""select all - delete"" and the TV will have trouble finding channels to sell you stuff. If you watch TV, you can add your favorite channels back.

Long press the button in the middle of the remote to delete the apps that it will let you delete. I deleted everything, because I use a Roku.

Find the setting to change input to your Roku. Or Chromecast or whatever you use. My Roku's interface is much nicer, easier to use, and has unobtrusive ads.

Never look at the awful Samsung interface again in your life. Unless you have to change your TV settings I guess. I dread the day when I need to do something on the TV interface. It hurt my brain and I barely had it on for 5 minutes.

Go meditate for 20 minutes to clear your head and forget all those ads.

The TV itself:

90% of what I watch are YouTube podcasts which are not even always recorded in 1080p, so I don't care much about picture quality. I can tell you that compared to my old TV this TV fires up quickly, is as clear as anything I'm sending it, and is definitely brighter. My old TV had a fading backlight so I had to crank the brightness all the way up to get a bright picture. This TV is quite dim. It came from the factory at 100% brightness and it get drowned out by normal lights. Pretty disappointing, as the new TV is about as dark as my old one. I primarily needed the new TV due to (1) my old TV had a bad capacitor so the power supply died and (2) the brightness was already up to max and my favorite videogames were difficult to see in dark areas as the backlight continued to dim. This new unit will do what I need. Barely.

The picture is okay. Like all basic LED TVs the blacks are washed out. Currently you'd have to upgrade to a proper OLED TV to get ""true"" black colors, but that TV costs multiples of this one. For the price, this TV looks okay.

Overall:

The ads are unacceptable. If I have to pay more for a TV without ads, I'll pay. The TV is fine, but honestly I only need ""a"" screen. I don't need 4k 60fps whatever. This was the best bang-for-your-buck on the market when I looked. It works. Just make sure you're prepared to kill the apps, and you have a Roku or a Chromecast or something with a half-decent interface.",Style: TV OnlySize: 55-Inch

  I was excited to purchase this 2020 4K TV. The image seemed blurry and dark to me. I asked my brother to look at it to see if it was just me. Good news image was fine. I had to do a lot of manual adjusting to coloring. The remote is simplistic in design and leaves little to be desired. You have to go into a few menus to get to sleep timers, Digital TV or apps. Their samsung tv app takes over everything, when all you want is to do is change the local digital channel. Nope, it automatically dumps you into Samsung TV Plus. Extremely annoying. It's a cumbersome layout to say the least. I am a Samsung household. DVD, TV, Phones, Tablets washing  machines all Samsung. This is the first samsung device that has me frustrated and disappointed. I'm giving the unit 3 stars simply because for a newer model it's missing a lot of bells and whistles.

  Granted, this is a significant upgrade from what I had, but this is a great TV. I bought it with the Samsung sound bar to replace the main TV in the living room. Great quality UHD picture and great sound as well. Setup was easy, it has all the apps I want, it's very light, and it has plenty of inputs. Just a few caveats though. I have an older Panasonic VCR/DVD recorder combo. It has HDMI out, but when trying to connect this there were connection problems. Perhaps all that is needed is a newer HDMI cable, but I haven't bothered. I just hooked it up composite. Another thing is I thought the Samsung sound bar would be more easily controlled with the same remote as for the TV. Once connected it does simply take over as the TV sound, with +, -, and mute controlled by the TV remote with no problem. The trouble is the sound bar power stays on when you turn off the TV. In other words, I thought you'd be able to turn everything on and off at once. Not the case, or at least I haven't figured it out. I just leave the sound bar on all the time. When you turn on the TV you first hear sound from the TV speakers for about 15 seconds while everything boots up, and then the sound bar takes over. Another thing is there are some OEM apps you can't delete. This is a bummer, because it clutters up the home screen with things I won't ever use.

  Overall, this is a great value TV. There are definitely some better TVs, but you would need to pay significantly more. This one has really great picture quality, although not the best blacks in a dark scene like an OLED, and the picture washes out some when viewing from a sharp angle. I’ve seen complaints about light bleed, but I haven’t noticed that issue yet. I did, however, constantly lose Internet connection... turns out, this is due to the “Instant On” feature. Once we turned it off, it has been working fine. The Instant On feature only makes a small improvement to boot time anyway.

  I don’t usually write reviews unless they’re positive, but I wanted to share what this company has put me through in hopes that it helps at least one person. I bought this tv and loved it for the first 6 months. Then the tv randomly died. I thought it was just an issue with the remote at first, so I put in new batteries and the remote light seemed to be working. Of course there’s no way to actually see if it was an issue with the remote or the tv itself as the tv doesn’t have any manual buttons. I troubleshooted with two different Samsung reps and to no avail. They offered to have a service rep come try to fix the tv. I agreed and then about a week later I had to call them to find out when this tech will be coming to my home in the middle of a pandemic. When I call, I find that there’s no service centers or techs in my area. So at this point, they issued me a ticket number and began the process of a refund. They also had me fill out papers for the refund to not be issued back to the card I purchased it on, but by direct deposit to my checking account. I hear nothing about when this refund will occur other than the blind faith that it will. Another week passes and I call Samsung again. They state they need to schedule a day and time for someone to pick up the tv at my home. I thought there were no service centers or techs in my area, but okay. Another week later, the tv is finally scheduled to get picked up. The tv gets picked up on the scheduled day and time. A week passes since the tv has been picked up and I’ve heard nothing from Samsung or been issued my refund. I’m not even notified that this tv has been received by Samsung until I reach out and ask. Additionally, I’m not sure where this refund will be issued because every time I call, no one can give me that information (even though I filled out papers for the occurrence of direct deposit). I’m always told that Case Management will call me and provide me with this information. A month later and I have yet to receive a call from Samsung ever, let alone Samsung Case Management. It has now been over a month since this process began and I’m unsure of if/how it will resolve. Samsung has the tv in their possession as well as the funds I used to purchase it. Ultimately, the lack of communication from Samsung is absolutely pathetic. From start to finish, this process was nothing but more work for me, the consumer, because of their defective product. Obviously, my original plan was use my refund money to buy a new tv, but it’s been so long that I couldn’t let Samsung hinder my life any more than they already have. Dramatic, I know - I’m a millennial. Needless to say, I will never purchase any product from Samsung ever again. I can only hope that I will receive my refund too.

  I bought this TV for my remote apartment, where I don't have internet.  So I can't comment on the Smart features.  But it has a great picture and linking it to a micro-USB card reader for viewing GOPRO videos is great.  Movies on the DVD player are also a pleasure to watch.  The higher definition allows viewing of 4K videos.  I'm not fond of the remote...searching for specific command buttons is a pain.  But I have an old remote that I found at Goodwill that works great.  Don't get me wrong, I love the TV and would buy it again.

  I bought this TV as a gift for my sister. I shopped around a few other models, etc., I found this Samsung as a excellent value, size, picture quality. and features. At first, when I unboxed and set the TV up, I had problems getting the device to communicate with the router. I feared there was a firmware issue with the TV. I rebooted the TV and router a few times and the issue was resolved. The TV works great, my sister loves it. Over all, I recommend this TV because of its quality and value.

  After 1 1/2 hours of troubleshooting Samsung finally told me to call Amazon as the TV I bought is defective . Amazon won't replace it because I bought it from the warehouse. They won't let me buy an exact same model at the same price as a replacement; instead today issued a $30 credit but not I'm not allowed to use it toward purchase of the more expensive replacement TV. Usually Amazon is fantastic, but I’m not impressed this time around.

",2.0 ,Amazone,"Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this about 3 weeks ago. It has a ""white"" space around the top left corner (and along the left side). It is mostly noticeable when there is a black / dark scene ... it is not solid black in the upper left corner (or along the left side) when it is evenly dark everywhere else (about 2 inch circumference in top left corner is the worst). Annoying but the box to return tv is gone so dealing with it. The OS and included apps worked well the first few weeks. Then this week the Prime app started acting up. It would not open. I clicked the Prime button it would not open so navigated to and selected the Prime app and it keeps taking me to the Samsung free channels or one of the connected game systems. VERY Annoying but we had like 5 other apps to pick from so we just moved on... unfortunately, next day ... Opening the Prime app was still an issue (it would not open) and now Apple + does not open either. Oh wait now Hulu doesn't open either. I unplugged TV and waited 60 seconds, plugged it back in ... still none of the apps will open. Soooo I went to settings>support>update... TV up to date, no updates available. Then I go into the app settings. Tried to delete Apple+ so I could reinstall... ugh, nope I cant delete it because it was preinstalled. Once there however, I decided to click Open from the apps settings section. TOTALLY UNACCEPTABLE solution to this problem BUT that worked. Then I went back to the appropriate way of selecting app to open. For whatever reason I am now able to open all apps again. Sorry but when I go to use my TV, I want it to just work as it should. I should not have to troubleshoot every time I turn on the TV 3 weeks in to be able to watch something. So yeah if you have patience and can accept less than perfect functionality and picture quality (but pretty good in fairness) then this is an option. That said, too many unacceptable issues for the prices so I give it 2 stars. if it would have worked the way it should without requiring me to do a bunch of troubleshooting after 3 weeks of use, It probably would have received 3 stars. If the screen was not already messed up in the top left corner and the apps worked without struggle I would have probably given it 4 stars because when the issues outlined above are not present, it is a pretty good tv. All this said, I would recommend you pay the extra for added warranty If you do purchase this TV because it is too big to return without a reasonable amount of frustration. (Oh and dont buy it just because it is Alexa enabled if you already have echos in the house. totally useless feature to have on the tv if you already have an Echo (or many). I got it with alexa thinking I would be able to ""easily"" sync my echo plus with it... which you can do but there is nothing easy at all about the setup and once it is setup there is a major delay between the TV audio and Echo audio. (Echo is delayed by like 2 - 3 seconds. (I have GB internet service with an excellent router). I will say, the speakers in the tv are pretty good so I just use the tv speakers. Over all, I was disappointed with this purchase but its good enough not to return (At least not yet)UpdateStill not loving the tv. The App Store section is Horrible! Search UI tries to be smart but fails miserably. Half the time you click install on an app it looks like it’s going to install and it doesn’t.The Samsung free content is annoying because it goes right to that instead of letting me pick what I want when I first turn on the tv and it’s louder than the other apps.It’s good enough for the sales price I paid but will never pay full price for a Samsung anything after the experience I’ve had with this TV.

    Samsung TVs Are Tricky to Connect to Sonos Beam Soundbar BUT They Can :-)
  
",5.0 , Ca Ja Mo,"Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2021","









  
  
    
  The TV is great but I had a heck of a time getting it to work my with Sonos Beam soundbar. After many hours of tech support, I want to share the solution below so others don't have to have a headache with it. Very pleased now.I am glad to report that it is working now. After various online website and app chat diagnostics reports, I was impatient and called the Sonos 800 number and I believe the tech support person's name was Lara. We spent almost 40 minutes on the call and she carefully had me isolate each separate HDMI device. From my end, I had the Sonos Beam SOLELY connected to the Samsung HDMI e-ARC input and it worked fine. In this instance, when one lowered the TV volume, instead of ""TV Speakers"" being the icon displayed with the volume changing displayed on the TV screen, the HDMI (Receiver) was the icon displayed. And since the only physical device connected at all (via HDMI) then it was the Sonos Beam, I could clearly and only hear sound from the Sonos Beam, could change the volume also using the Sonos S2 App and the TV remote, and no sound was ever dropped in and out. Then we connected the Google Chromecast via another HDMI, and the Sonos Beam still worked. Lastly, we connected the Comcast Xfinity cable box via another HDMI, and it still worked. Mind you: unplugging and replugging the power cords and HDMIs for all of these devices had not worked for me before. Only when I solely had the Samsung TV play video and audio through a native SmartTV app. For whatever reason, the order of connecting these devices seemed to have made a difference for me. I wanted to share this with others since this has been a huge pain in the butt, I was about to return one or both products, and none of the other community tech support postings seemed to have a solution posted for the last several months. Lastly, before this was resolved, and the Beam was only successfully playing music with other synced wifi Sonos speakers via Spotify, the S2 App would not allow me to finish the ""TV Setup"" connection either via HDMI ARC nor the Optical-HDMI adapter. After this was resolved, that S2 App ""TV Setup"" option went through automatically. I'm a happy camper now. Took awhile but wanted to share this possible solution with others.

  SAMSUNG 43-inch Class Crystal UHD TU-8000 Series - 4K UHD HDR Smart TV with Alexa Built-in (UN43TU800)This is a great budget entry level TV. It's been out for awhile. Here are my impressions. It delivers a crystal clear picture in almost all formats (720p, 1080p, 4K, etc). It upscales very well. It has a very simple set up. Just insert what I call the ""chicken legs"" . Put the batteries in the blue tooth remote. Attach a source to the TV & begin set up which is a snap. As far as picture quality goes, this is better than decent. I didn't notice any missing pixels, banding, dirty artifacts, or poor screen uniformity. Infact the contrast & the uniformity is quite good. Better than most TVs I've reviewed. This does not have local dimming but it doesn't need it really. The colors are saturated in standard mode fairly decently. I will say HDR is not great with this TV set because it doesn't get bright enough. The nits are around 300 for both standard & HDR. For HDR to pop the nits would have to be much greater. That being said, standard is awesome on this TV, especially in dark rooms. In brighter rooms you will notice reflection issues but it isn't that big of a deal. Motion is smooth for high speed sports & Response time for gaming is surprisingly good for a 60 Hz panel . Sound quality is average. Nothing to write home about. I would suggest a sound bar to get bass. The remote is simple & intuitive. It is bluetooth so no cheap infrared. All in all, this Samsung model does a good job in most areas for a modest price. 5 stars!

    I’ll never buy another Samsung TV again!!

  I was looking to upgrade the TV in my living room. I already own a set of Samsung Sound towers, which I love, so I figured I’d buy a Samsung TV to complement them. Found a 65” Samsung QLED on sale at Walmart. Even though it initially connected to my WiFi with no issues and had Bluetooth capabilities, I was unable to get it connected with my Sound towers either way. I called Samsung Customer Service for assistance, but they couldn’t help me fix the issue. I figured rather than go thru the hassle of returning it, I’ll keep it and deal with it as is. About 2 weeks later, apps started crashing, sound was going in and out, and the tv kept disconnecting from my home network. So I returned it!Still in search of a TV for my living room, I turned to Amazon and found this one. Based on many of the reviews, I placed my order. The TV was delivered right on time, and I’m excited! While the TV was easy enough to get set up, it has no option to connect to my Sound towers via Bluetooth nor WiFi.  Excitement gone...but oh well, right? Don’t want to go through the process of another return, so I’m just gonna make this one work out.As I go to download a few apps that I like to use for streaming, I realize that there are about 13 apps that are already preinstalled that I have absolutely no use for. What makes the matter so disgusting is that NONE of the preinstalled apps can be removed, deleted or uninstalled!! Now I have 13 apps that are of no use to me taking up space and memory on a TV that I paid for! “NOT HAPPY AT ALL!! We spend hundreds of dollars on these devices only to not have any control over the content or how we use them anymore, and I personally find that quite sickening! The QLED that I returned before purchasing this one also came with preloaded apps, but I did have options to remove them and add the apps I wanted. I can’t understand how anybody could be happy with any device that is more than halfway loaded with apps that they’ll never use and can never remove.So, moving on...picture quality is great, but after about 6 hrs in (same day as delivery), app closes and I’m presented with a message saying “having trouble connecting.” So after troubleshooting with no resolve, I decided to reset to factory and set up again. I go into settings and the option to reset is GREYED OUT!!! Ok, so I’m like “Who does that?!?!”So now I’m looking through to see what options I DO have, only to find out that many of the options that were available on the QLED that I returned are NOT available on this TV, i.e. software update, broadcasting, tv reset, and some of the picture and sound settings. I have 3 smaller TVs of different brands, and much, much cheaper that I’ve had for years now and I haven’t had any problems with any of them! I can’t take it. Now I’m returning this TV, but afraid to buy another one...especially if I can’t own it after I purchase it. Everything is getting to be like houses and real property now...no matter how much money you put into it, it’s never really yours.

    Another Disappointment From Samsung
  
",3.0 ,Thomas Bland,"Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  While the picture is awesome, the TV has several 'memory' issues! It forgets setting between power cycles, and apps come and go. After spending 45 minutes on chat with a Samsung rep, I decided 'it is what it is!' I have purchased only Samsung electronics for the past 9 years, but after this TV, I will be rethinking that. I previously purchased a Samsung A50 cell phone, and it was a terrible device, but I paid full price here on Amazon, so dumping it is not an option. I never imagined I would get a second lemon with this TV. I almost repacked it to send back, but the picture is it's ONLY saving grace. I had removed my Roku, as all my streaming service are included as 'apps' on this set. The problem is, once they are installed and 'signed in' the set forgets their logins and position on on the home screen. What an annoying pain to log in EVERY TIME you access the app. So, with the Roku back on HDMI1, the set performs flawlessly. Just irritating that I didn't gt 100% of what I paid for. Oh, and tech support says the reason is...wait for it...not all apps are compatible with their sets? What...they're YOUR APPS...how could they not be compatible? Although, the YouTube app works, as advertised, so there must be something to the compatibility issue.

  Needed a new tv for the room and man I’m glad I got this. It came loaded with channels that you get for free just need a wife connection. Hooking up my Xbox immediately detected and put the tv into game mode which I can say looks really nice. Looks great in a decent lit to dimmer room. Remote has voice control which I know for some can be a deal breaker also has Bluetooth which is great for connecting wireless headphones. There is a bit of delay when I was gaming not sure if it was internet or whatever but it wasn’t unbearable. I did need a chrome cast to connect my MacBook to stream couldn’t find a easier way to do it. It does have all the apps you need Netflix, YouTube, Hulu, ... ect. My only cons so far after 3 months are the Sound can be a little low and not filling or surround if your looking for a higher quality maybe invest in a sound bar my model didn’t have one but it wasn’t a deal break. The Viewing angles can be a problem if in a wide room and watching at an angle or having a lot of people over not everyone’s going to have the same quality views of the tv. The ports for the hdmi are at a horrible awkward angle makes it hard to connect especially if you have it mounted. The tv also has no on/off button so tether your remote or put a tracking device on it. Samsung makes quality products if your looking for a tv you couldn’t go wrong choosing this

  This seems like a very good value, though I've had it only a few days.  It's our second tv (for the bedroom) and it's the perfect sized screen (43"") for it .The picture quality is 4-star, as I noted and the price is very fair.  Didn't think much of the built-in Samsung Smart Apps, but I've rarely found any viewing device's ""native"" streaming apps to be as good or as dependable as those on an external device (using Roku now).Only complaint is the size and design of the remote;  it is way to tiny and ""fiddly."" Easy to lose and hard to use,  I'd say.

It's very low brightness could anger some people; check the settings.I did have one problem with an optical cable getting stuck in the TV. Samsung, please fix that. Luckily, I was able to remove it---it did require a lot of effort (with pliers).If you don't like the soap opera effect, turn down the judder setting, under clarity.This is my first fully ""smart"" TV.

  Simply put, not having a button *anywhere* on the unit to physically turn power on/off (much less other basic functions) is a crime.  Sure, most people never use them, but they are useful in a pinch.  I'd even settle for the ""behind the back 5 buttons"" style that is annoying as hell to use, but at least gets the job done.The only other complaint I have:Changing inputs requires too many button pushes (Home, <-, <-, <-, <-, <-, ^ - then left/right to select).  3 'hotkeys' for Smart inputs are included (Netflix, Amazon, Samsung), but without any customization I've seen yet, not much use for anyone who uses Hulu over one of the others, for example.  And toggling between a cable box and DVD player, or a stream/computer input is annoying.The picture and sound quality are great.  I've seen better, but not by significant leaps (and none for a better value).  Instruction manual is a bit lacking, but nowhere near the travesty of many guides out there.  Stands are clearly labelled (moderately idiot-proof; better than the armrests on the chair I ordered a year ago).  Bezel is gorgeously small.  Stand prevents forward/backward rocking well (even clunking it firmly on the top edge requires a good hit to risk the TV tipping).Would give this a 4.5 stars if I could, but lack of the physical buttons prevents me from giving it a full 5, hands down.

  I guess this is common for 4K televisions but the initial picture, especially for movies, was nearly unwatchable due to the motion settings. Blockbuster movies looked like weird daytime soap operas. So if you get this TV and are dismayed by that, Google and YouTube are your friend. Once you properly tweak the settings the picture is great and film motion looks great. Since then the only issue I’ve had is that the TV sometimes drops it’s wifi connection and it takes some resetting/rebooting of the TV to restore connection. But I’m not yet sure if that’s actually an issue with the TV or our Xfinity router.

",5.0 ,Tucan Reviews,"Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2021","









  
  
    
  After reviewing and deciding the added expense for a OLED type screen wasn't worth it I went for this model. Its an upgrade from my older 55 inch tv in the same UHD line. So far it's great, colors are nice, no issues with setup, unboxing, installation, missing pixels etc. My only issue is that is bigger and now catches a little glare  form the window. I doubt any other tv would glare so no knocks about the product. The remove works fine, i do with it had a few more buttons and features. I did like the Input button being on the old remotes, this one if found through the menu. I watch a lot of things Via USB and the simple remote actually makes that operation take a few more steps.  Anyway, everything works great. The speaker setup wasn't that hard and I also purchased the surround speakers which work nice as well. Happy so Far!

    Amazing Picture, Cluttered Hub, ZERO Data Privacy

  Pro:Took like minutes to unbox tv and have it playing PBS.  My kids like curious george.TV used our 8 yr old soundbar automatically.The picture quality is ridiculus.  I played Avatar off Plex on max quality (4k@HEVC@50mbps) and it rocked.Price.  Under $400 all in awesome.Tips:Setup network asap if you plan to do more than watch broadcast TV or DVDs.Consider buying a different remote.Cons:The remote is the size of a large marker and has like 10 buttons.  It is hard to use.  It is like dyson made it.  Form over function.My home theatre Samsung TV is almost 5 yrs old, so I had some Samsung sneaky smart bar ads and data mining victim experience prior to new TV.  Let me tell you...  Samsung has upped their intrusion game.  Be prepared to accept various huge privacy policies and to create a Samsung account if you plan to download even one extra app or even want to use Netflix.  It is ridiculous.I had to block about 15 keywords in my network router settings to keep all the advertisement to near zero, but still occassionally see a new car ad.  my guess is that Samsung serves some ads from 3rd parties.  prob google.  get a wireless router of ur own and learn how to filter traffic.  you wont be sorry.The Smart Hub is a cluttered flashing mess.  Dont view if you are prone to siesures.  Be prepared to live with 10 apps you will never use.  They cant be deleted.  Be prepared for content overload. it is hard to use.  Samsung sacrifices customer ease of use to keep their narketing partner apps up front.The bottom line is that i only plan to stream netflix and watch my plex server.  if you plan to use smart hub a lot, consider other brands.

  We upgraded to a newer Samsung for the software.  I have impaired hearing and rely on Bluetooth headphones to listen while my wife watches with normal audio from the TV speakers.  The TV has built in Bluetooth but  you have to select one or the other.  Can't use Bluetooth and TV speakers at the same time.  In fact you can't use digital audio cable and Bluetooth only. One audio output selected in setup.  This is worse than the TV we replaced. A Samsung that is 8 years old.  Sounds like going backwards to me.  She likes the newer software so we keep it.  Guess I will give up watching or maybe install the old TV in the garage.

  I had ordered a 50 inch Samsung Smart TV.  It was supposed to arrive on Monday, August 17th.  I planned on being home to receive it.  I came home yesterday, Friday, August 14th, after being gone all day.  I arrived home at 5:30pm to find my TV in front of my steps, practically laying down flat, in full view of anyone who goes by.  I live on a corner.  It was obvious what it was by the picture on the box.  The bottom of the box was unsealed, so there was no way to pick it up without the TV falling out!  I would think that a signature would be required for a $400 TV.  Sure glad that it didn't rain!I do like the TV.  Has a beautiful picture!

  I had a 10 year old Samsung 1080P TV that I’d been very happy with and had been perfectly reliable. Televisions have gotten so cheap and I simply wanted a more cinematic experience with a larger screen. This TV arrived in perfect condition, on time without delay. Perhaps my expectations were a little more modest but I am completely satisfied. I didn’t realize the TV would have built in WiFi and that I’d no longer need my Apple TV box. I am does have cable service, just Netflix and a home made antenna (!) and I was extremely impressed at the reception. With the old TV I was constantly moving the antenna to get a channel and some channels I could never get. This thing receives every channel with perfect clarity and that alone was worth the price. I don’t expect TV,s to have good tuners since everyone streams or has some sort of TV service, except me. I was prepared to be frustrated with setup but it turned out to be very intuitive and actually quite quick. The remote is small with few buttons but is highly ergonomic and also very ergonomic. Even my wife, who hates technology, found it straight forward to use and we never resorted to the e-manual. Lastly, the built in speakers are actually pretty decent for watching normal television. There definitely some surround processing and some delays to add depth and a sound stage. My wife was not happy with me about buying this thing but as soon as she realized how good the reception was, all was instantly forgiven. We’ll see if it holds up but right now I am completely satisfied. It was a deal at $500.

  We had purchased a Samsung TV from Amazon in 2009 that works beautifully until June 2020.  So, when we needed a new TV, we called Amazon.  It was delivered on June 10, 2020.  Our grandsons set it up for us and we were thrilled until 12 weeks later while we were watching it, it went black.  We called Amazon and followed directions to check it out in a half hour call.  They tried, but could not help and sent us to Samsung who were supposed to call us back the next day.  They did not!  So we called them.  After another 30 to 45 minute call, we were told they would send a serviceman.  The estimated that it would be the end of this week or next before someone could come because they were having trouble locating a serviceman. I asked to speak to. manager.  That Never Happened.  Instead, we received an Email with the name of a repair company at least 80 miles away.  We called to try to make an appointment.  They could/would not give us an appointment. They said they would call us back in a day or two. We Are Not Satisfied!

  Amazing value. Easy to setup. I use a narrower TV stand so also purchased a center post TV Stand that uses the VESA mount on the back of the TV. Was it difficult to setup? Actually it was Super Easy, Barely an Inconvenience! Love the fact that the Samsung one remote actually synced right up and controls my Amazon Fire TV just like the native Amazon remote. I will say the built in speakers do suck. No bass at all! LOL but I expected that so have a soundbar on the way as well.

    Good UHD 4K HDR smart TV, great value.
  
",4.0 ,Ruben Mejia,"Reviewed in the United States August 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  Picture quality is very good, with some adjustments to be made from factory presets, I can get a very good display quality, good contrast ratios, and nice HDR viewing. Sound is decent, while lacking bass. The remote control design and Tizen OS work as intended, all necessary adjustments just some clicks away. More than three HDMI inputs would have been more sound than incorporating composite inputs in my opinion. Overall, a very good smart set, wide viewing angles and not-so-reflective screen helps too.Apart from these observations, I was unlucky to get a damaged unit, the lower center of the screen came with a visible spot, apparently from shipping mishandling. But Amazon responded quickly, they ordered a pick-up of the first set and sent the replacement in a reasonable time.I recommend this Smart TV.

  It took me forever to choose which TV to purchase.  I made the wrong choice wit the TU8000 and really Samsung.  4K HDR is horrible and dark and the only thing you can do it buy an Amazon NON 4K device.  You try to fix the settings and update the firmware and everything is always greyed out and cannot be changed.  Really disappointed with this TV.  I wish I would have looked closer at and LG or even Hisense.  My friend has a Hisense and the picture is perfect and it is must easier to navigate the settings.  He paid $200 less than I did.

    Quality 4K picture, but smart TV feature is unreliable.
  
",3.0 ,Just a Kit from Akron,"Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2020","









  
  
    
  When I purchased this TV I really had no interest in the smart TV features. Having my cable box and Apple TV connected to my last “dumb” TV had always been sufficient, but I thought I would give the smart feature a try. My internet speed is usually around 300 Mbps (I use OOKLA regularly to verify) and I don’t often have outages. Regardless, this TV loses its connection with my wifi almost daily and no amount of troubleshooting via the TV (see photo) will restore it. The only way to get it to reconnect is to physically unplug the TV and plug it back in. I don’t know about you, but after I’ve settled in to watch a movie or my favorite show, getting back up to unplug and replug the TV is pretty annoying. I’ve stopped trying to use the smart features entirely and have gone back to switching between cable box and Apple TV.Bottom line: If you’re looking for a TV with a quality 4K picture, this one is a good choice for the price point. If you’re looking for a smart TV, keep looking.

  The Home Screen on this thing is so dedicated to advertising and pushing crap at you that it’s usefulness really suffers. OK, so it comes preloaded with a bunch of unwanted apps (crapsware). That’s survivable. Maybe even useful for the few wanted apps. But... it doesn’t let you delete, or even hide, most of the crapware. Also, I t defaults to trying to get you to select the Samsung flavored crapware.So, the only option is to plug in an Amazon fire and to use this TV as a monitor. The Alexa integration is better that way and the attempts to funnel you into crapware are more manageable.

  Is it possible to give a product less than one star?!  First off, I will say that I have always been a Samsung person.  Every appliance and electronic device (except my phone) are made by Samsung.  I have never had a bad experience with any of their products.  However, something is horribly wrong with this TV.  The one I have is a replacement item -- the first one was non-functional.  This TV was rarely used since its purchase in at the end of June 2020.  It was working fine one day, and the next was non-functional with lines all over the screen.  Of course, I was exactly one month outside of Amazon's return window, which meant I had to deal with Samsung's repair technicians.  What a horrible experience that was.  Basically, a technician shows up, doesn't even look at the TV thoroughly, makes a quick call, and then says ""sorry, we cannot help you.""  Don't even get me started about how completely rude and unprofessional the Samsung customer service agent was over the phone.  I have rarely had a customer service agent try to start arguments with me, and hopefully never will again.I am so unhappy with this experience overall, and will likely never purchase a Samsung product again.  All in all, I suggest staying clear of this TV.  There is a reason it's so inexpensive.  It's garbage.Signed,A Very Unhappy Samsung Customer

    HDMI Ports and Remote Control are a bit disappointing

  First off I knew what I was getting HDMI wise when I ordered this TV. 3 HDMI ports is not a lot. I dont see why any tv should come with less than 4, preferably 5. But this TV was a good price so I settled for 3. Unforunately my wall mount obstructs HDMI3, the port that sits pointing straight out of the back of the TV. So I only have 2 usable HDMI ports. This TV is replacing a 46 Samsung 3D that just burned out after about 8 years. It had 4 HDMI ports. So squezing into 2 HDMI ports is frustrating.The remote control is odd. Its not a remote control in the traditional sense. Its closer to an AppleTV remote. Which I guess is fine, but there is no easy way to switch Sources. There is no Source button.I guess all of my complaints stem from, I just want this TV to be a TV. I need lots of inputs and a way to switch between them. I have no interest in the Samsung bloatware that is loaded onto all new TV's these days.UPDATE: I am downgrading the stars for this. The Input select menu is extremely frustrating. It seems to pop up constantly for no reason and is difficult to make go away. I have resorted to using the remote that came with my previous Samsung TV. At least that remote has an exit button that will make the pop up menu dissapear. This TV isnt designed to be used with anything other than Samsung bloatware it seems.

  Very happy with this TV. It is my 3rd Samsung and they keep getting better (smarter).I wanted a second, lower priced TV that would give me a great picture and had bluetooth. There were a couple of others that ""suggested"" BT in the Q&A and reviews, but none that actually listed it as a feature. I'm sure others had that feature but I wasn't comfortable when it wasn't listed in their product description or manuals.We love the TV but the remote can be a challenge for some of us ""older"" users. Since this is my 3rd Samsung, I can manage it (somewhat) but find it difficult to find common features such as Guide or Info, not easy to locate without reading the manual. They have packed a ton of features into a minimum number of buttons that are not easy to see in dim light. They redeem themselves by making the integration of our Xfinity remote easy.

I’ve literally never been so disappointed in how badly something performed after I bought it. I never return stuff for the most part, at this point about to just crush the screen and shove it out my window. Useless, garbage TV that gets choked up on its own “smart” technology. Please don’t buy this is you’re foolishly expecting to watch/play something later that day (or week, apparently).

  Have had this for 2 weeks now and I can say it's really nice.  To be on the safe side, I also purchased the 4 year extended warranty.  We bought this to replace a Hisense H7 that was having some issues with starting up.  This is quite a bit nicer than the H7, in both picture quality and sound. The TV sound is just that - TV sound (not bad, but so much is missing!).  I added a Vizio sound system (5.1) on the HDMI ARC channel and the sound is outstanding.  Just wish the remote was a bit smarter since we have a cable box with record capability and have to use the cable remote to access whatever is recorded.  That aside, this is quite a nice TV for the price.  It arrived well packed, set up quite easily, was ready to go as soon as I plugged it in, and went through the simple setup program.  We added the apps that we wanted and that was all it took.  We were watching our favorite programs (on BritBox) within a half hour.

  This TV arrived Aug 14.  No picture by Aug 18.  Called Amazon who referred us to Samsung.  This TV has inhouse service warranty.  Samsung said they would be here to fix it Aug 25.  On Aug 24 they called to say they would not come.  They say TV has to be shipped back to them and received BEFORE they would do anything else.  Bottom line, they say new TV arrival in 4 weeks.  And the new one would not have a new 1 year warranty but only continue  from date of purchase which was Aug 10.  Do not buy this TV.

  The TV was defective. I contacted the manufacturer, then contacted Amazon.  Amazon immediately sent a replacement.But I am annoyed with its software. The home page is built around bloatware i.e., links to paid subscriptions for many online streaming providers.The operating system is not exactly intuitive. The quality of the user manuals is uneven...I often have to use third-party information, instead.Samsung customer support - both by phone and by chat - leaves much to be desired. In-home repair is non-existent. Samsung's repair people are indifferentThat being said, the picture is excellent for the price.

  This was a Christmas present for my sons' new man cave. Unfortunately, I waited until the room was done before unboxing it because the screen was broken and it's too late for me to return it. The box was undamaged and sat untouched until we opened it. When we did there was a tiny pinpoint speck of visible, tactile damage to the screen. When we turned it on the whole display was ruined. There's no way this happened after it was boxed. The damage looks like a single pin prick, no cracks, spider webbing, etc. and it's deep enough to damage the whole image and there's no damage to the box.

  I got this tv to replace a 10 year old 32” Sharp and I am amazed at the difference. The picture is almost unrealistically detailed in comparison to the older set. Some of the reviews that I read about this Samsung complained that it wasn’t bright enough or that there wasn’t enough detail. I’m not sure what other TV sets those reviewers were comparing it to, but for me I am very satisfied with the picture quality.Setting it up was a snap. The on screen menu walked me through it step by step, and I was surfing channels in under 10 minutes.I also love the remote control. There are much fewer buttons on it than what I’m used to but it is very intuitive and I also no longer need the extra remote control that came with my cable provider.

  Ihe photo was taken minutes after unboxing the product. This television arrived with cracks behind display rendering it unusable. I am unsure if this is due to manufacturing or handling of the TV in the warehouse/truck.*Update* The product works great! The colors really pop, and game mode has a snappy response time for input lag/input delay (about 10 ms), which is important for me as a gamer.The thing keeping me from giving this TV 5 stars is... the incredibly annoying TV show ads that pop up whenever you turn on the TV on the main display. It's 2020 and this is a smart TV, so consumers who are paying for a premium TV should have the option to shut off advertisements, but you aren't given that option with this television. This is really anti-consumer and should be a simple fix for such a large company IMHO.

  This score is based on the overall set up experience and not just the quality of the TV.  I'll get straight to it:- For a namebrand TV, I was disappointed that it did not come with the screws to use with a mount.  Really annoying but fine.-- User manual keeps referencing some Quick Start Up guide for the type of screws I need.  I scour the surprisingly few documents included and there was no QSU guide or specific info about type of screws.  Getting even more annoyed.-- I scan the Q&A of the product page and although there were plenty of people that had the same question I did, no one had the mf decency to respond in a helpful way. Annoyed turns to pissed off.-- I call up customer service to ask for the screws specs I need to screw a mount to the back of the UN43TU8000FXZA.  The guy tells me M4L14 screws.  I quickly find out that is not true.  One look and it is obvious they are way too f-ing small.  I am really pissed off now.  It's bad enough they don't include these screws or specify in the mf manual.  Now their customer service tells me inaccurate info?  Really pissed off now.-- I use the chat feature and message with customer service now.  The guy tells me M8 X 1.25mm X 20-22mm.  Finally!  That sounds right, right?  WRONG.  They are too short and don't clear the mount.  I am raging pissed now by the bs runaround they've sent me on.  I take it upon myself to get several lengths - and FINALLY I found the correct one.CORRECT MOUNT SCREW SIZE: M8 x 1.25mm x 25mm- Also, for some reason, apps won't install if I am connected directly by wire.  It has to be connected to the home wifi network in order to install apps.  No joke.  I only figured this out after reading forums about other people having similar issues.The screen quality is good as expected but the hours I wasted trying to set up the TV is unacceptable.  Thus the low score.

  Upper half of picture display had a dark band across it.  I spent a good 10 hours troubleshooting the issue using input from various Samsung forums and online tech support.  Online tech support told me a in-home service will be needed.  Scheduled a home service later in the week.  Tech told me they would return a week later with part(s) needed to make the repair.  One week later and techs did not come out.  When I called to inquire I was told the tech service had been cancelled as Samsung will be issuing me a refund?!  I called Samsung's tech support number where I was the one who had to explain the issue with the TV and the repair (lack thereof) timeline.  Was placed on hold numerous times and transferred to other another department - whole process took about 2.5 hours.  Followed up with them today on status and they are ""still reviewing"" the return?  I have owned several Samsung TVs in my lifetime and all have performed great.  This TV was not working correctly right out of the box and Samsung support has been stringing me along for nearly two weeks now.  I have since purchased a comparable Sony that I am very happy with.

  I love this TV picture quality, and it's been a great step up from my old screen. Steam Link is a great plus too! However, after updating my phone to Android 11, I've been unable to use most of the highly touted features of this TV. Normally, you can install Samsung's SmartThings app on your phone and use it to control your TV, but it is completely incompatible with the latest official Android version. I contacted Samsung and a fix won't be out until November, even though they've had access to the new Android OS for at least 3 months now. Really disappointed in their software support, and it worries me. Its unclear how long I'll actually be able to use this TV, given that maintenance seems to be low priority.Update: The wifi issue is beyond frustrating and needs to be addressed. Anyone who needs wifi for their tv should be cautious purchasing from Samsung. It seems like this is a long standing issue that they will refuse to address. I saw comments on Samsung's forums dating back to a year ago, so it doesn't seem to be a priority.

  I love this smart TV! It came with Netflix and prime buttons on the remote and other apps you can access on the screen.  Beautiful picture and easy to set up. This weighs 25 lbs and I couldn’t do this alone so a friend unboxed and set it up on a tv stand.Now for the buts:We don’t have cable and instead chose to install an antenna pad in the window. The instructions stated to scan channels on the tv and add them to the channel list.The Samsung e-manual had this to say under “antenna”:“If you have cable, you don’t need an antenna.”There was no reference that would help us so we then looked under scanning and adding channels which directed us to go to the live tv app but it was nowhere to be found.We then did a chat session with Samsung help and he simply reiterated the steps in the manual, we replied back “we can’t find the live tv app!”  He then wrote “go to the e-manual and ended the session. No “can I help you with anything else,” nothing. What a waste of time.After almost 2 hours of frustration and pressing any and all buttons, the live tv app magically appeared and we finally were able to add the channels we needed.So the TV by itself is great but don’t expect any real help from Samsung. They assume their customer is 20 years old and has more tech experience than they do.

  I got this 75"" TV to replace a five year old 55"" Samsung as I wanted a larger picture and noticed the older TV had an issue that one would think was related to slow internet even though I have a high speed plan. I mounted this on a wall (fortunately I had a wall mount already for TVs up to 75"") with the help of one other person.I do not have Cable TV but have a digital antenna purchased from Amazon for $40. That antenna is pulling in about 75 channels of free content and Samsung actually provides another 50 or so free English language channels (Samsung TV Plus) avaialble through an internet connection. So I now have about 125 channels and via thh digital antenna have the major stations (CBS, NBC and ABC) and I have a monthly cable bill of $0.Picture quality is great and you can contol with Alexa as well as via a voice button on the remote. TV sound is good but for movies and sports I do use a soundbar for a more intense effect.Very happy one month in and enjoying the NFL playoffs in a theater like atmosphere.

The soonest appointment was about 10 days out - not ideal but okay. TV repairman came yesterday....he tried a few things and nada. Then said he has to check his truck for a motherboard. 45 minutes later he appeared again and he was fresh out of motherboards. He said someone would call me to reschedule. I asked him  why he thought the motherboard would go so soon after purchasing and he said, ""Who knows how long these TVs have been sitting around in the Amazong warehouse"" So, yes my TV is new as in it's never been used but how old is the giant fella really? Anyway I waited a day and no call. I just called the service center and it's going to be another full 2 weeks before someone comes back out. No TV during Covid is pretty painful....I sure hope the next repair person remembers to bring the motherboard!

  I really wish this television had better software. This television has a great picture and the apps are okay, but the smart hub is terrible. You can connect the television to Alexa (through SmartThings) but the ability is limited to basically power on/off, some inputs, play, and pause. I really wish that you could launch apps and navigate. I also have a TiVo connected to this television, the remote and smart hub used to control the TiVo but about a month ago that stopped working. Even a factory reset did not get the smart hub to even control the TiVo again. Maybe the most annoying thing is that you actually have to enter the developer mode of the television to set the backlight levels to reasonable maximums and minimums. Otherwise, the screen is overall too dark but also causes the backlight to flicker when there is uneven brightness in the image.

I returned it via amazon's 2nd party service pilot with no problem and they sent a replacement. The replacement arrives and the TV gets mounted and everything is working smoothly for a couple of hours and THEN the TV shuts TOTALLY off on its own. I ran ALL of the troubleshooting and nothing worked. A technician confirmed that there was internal damage. So now I am waiting to return the 2nd one.If you can I would highly recommend avoiding using Amazon to purchase a TV of this size.

  As tv's get cheaper... the components inside do as well. Compare any Roku tv to using a Roku unit and you'll quickly find that your tv has a processor that is horribly slow and glitchy.My new Samsung is no exception. The smart features are slower than 1989 internet service. Simple menu changes take awhile to switch which means jumping from one feature or app to another can be frustrating.I'd rather have tv's labeled with that information.

  That's what just about every program we watch on Dish looks like, a live video feed and not a recording. It's hard to describe, but I can tell you once you get the color and brightness the way you prefer it, that's it. Right now we just have 1080p HD, but a few of the shows we watched were in HDR10 at 4K, and it's just beautiful!Not much time spent setting it up, we don't have local channels so no time waiting for a channel scan, just select the input and audio source and you are good to go. Can't say too much about this because as far as I am concerned there isn't a better flat panel screen made than Samsung. Just look at a Galaxy S series phone sometime and you'll see the same quality there as on this TV. Great choice, great picture.

It reported my warranty was valid till October 31, 2021.  That is 9 months of warranty instead of 1 year.  It seems to me either product was used or returned and repackaged therefore I am getting a remainder of the unused warranty.Let's hope these issues are resolved.  If, not I will return the TV to the seller.  Amazon customer service told me to give 3-5 days to the seller to resolve the issue after that they will gladly take it over to find resolution.EDIT:  Seller told me to carry big box to the FedEx dropbox location, even I informed them of my old age and requested they inform FedEx to pickup.  They refused.  Following was my response:  OK, I will try to find someone to help.  BUT I WILL MAKE SURE IN FUTURE I NEVER EVER PURCHASE ANYTHING FROM YOU.First, you shipped the defective product, second, it was clear from the Samsung Warranty site that Samsung can honor only 9 months of warranty instead of 1 year, because either it was a used or refurbished product.

  I bought this tv one week ago and everything worked well.  Today it would not let me into my prime app.  I did everything that was suggested and still it would not work. I rest my smart hub which did nothing but cause me a headache and then I reset my TV back to the factory settings which also did nothing.  I was about to send the TV back to amazon but I figured one more try and it worked.  I am still not sure why it wasn't working. I am pretty smart when it comes to tech, so it wasn't something dumb like no internet.  I hope it doesn't happen again.  Other then that the TV is great so far!  I am a little worried because of all the bad reviews.  I hope they do not come true.  Overall I would tell others to get it.  I think very few things in life today should get five out of five stars because in my opinion that would be perfection and very little is perfect.  So far I am happy I bought this TV!  Will update if I change my mind.

  I got more than I needed with this tv. Since I don't have an internet connection I don't use the smart features. The picture quality is good. The only cons are the remote. It's very sensitive. The instructions aren't that great. Hit the wrong button and it ends up trying to set up the smart features. I'm using the AV function to attach to my Dish network box. Then it takes at least 4-5 tries to return to the AV function. The other con is the stand. Very flimsy and light weight. I got another stand. My cat likes to use the top of the TV as a jumping platform to get to higher furniture. After I found the TV leaning forward I got another stand.

  The picture is actually really good when it's hooked up where there is a satellite box.  Otherwise, the picture is amazing subpar for sure!  However, that probably has little to do with the TV itself.  In addition, the sound level leaves a lot to be desired  I have to crank it up almost to the full level, and it's still lacking, IMO.  But for the price it's a great TV.  In addition, it's my first smart TV, and I am not impressed with Smart TVs at this point.

  The user manual is huge, and not very easy to follow.  The menu could be several pages in bigger type, and it reads like a mini bible the type is so small. Also, trying to tie in the optical cable into the TV settings was a little difficult, as the TV would default back to TV speaker, even though I have an HW-R650 soundbar and subwoofer.The very best way to connect a soundbar through this TV is via the bluetooth connection option.  After struggling for days trying to control my new Samsung soundbar with the new TV remote, I can now adjust the volume of the TV and soundbar simultaneously using the bluetooth option.It would be nice to have a cable menu option on the remote for your cable box, as you will still have to use your original cable remote to check the cable program menu.

",4.0 ,jbordetas,"Reviewed in the United States September 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  First off I did not purchase this TV here. Got a better deal through some credit card (Amex) offers.  Now, I have more than a few Amazon reviews that you can peruse in case you think this review is in anyway tainted. That said i was VERY disappointing when I got this set. The Tizen OS is just a nightmare. Difficult to use, non intuitive and so intrusive. The remote is so sensitive that merely brushing it with your hands will make the smart hub kick in and that is a huge issue for me (YMMV). The apps were slow and try as I might I was simply not getting the color I expected. Heck my 75 inch TCL had a better pic and it was a 2018 model!I was googling ways to get the most out of this tv and came across a forum post about pairing it to a ROKU Ultra. Well all the other TV's I have 75, 65 and 55 are all Roku so I knew I would love the interface. What I was NOT expecting was just how better the color processing is on the ROKU vs the TV.  The apps are faster, the color is more vibrant and over all I simply enjoy it much better than the out of the box experience.I now feel that this TV suits my needs, the screen size is impressive and now the screen image matches my expectations. Funny what a software and hardware change can do. Now before you go complaining about having to sp[end another hundo on the Roku, I already spent 1500+ just to get the TV what is another 100 to get 85 inches of real estate pumping out an amazing picture for that price. Seriously, in my experience everything looks better through the ROKU Ultra vs the Tizen interface.Now let's talk about connecting a PC to it. I have a NUC8i7HVK and that little powerhouse with it AMD Vega M chip makes this TV scream! Even the less than impressive HDR shines. So in my opinion the limitation of this TV is not the Panel itself as i have seen the difference a quality input provides. All in all now that I found the solution I can rate this PC a 4 stars. If i wasn't petty I would rate it 5 because with a few minor and non costly adjustments this TV stands out. But I am so it gets 4 from me

    Excellent TV - no major complaints
  
",5.0 ,JP,"Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2021","









  
  
    
  I purchased the 65"" version of the Samsung Crystal UHD TU-8000.Pros and Cons:  * Mounting was relatively straightforward. Like other reviews, I did have to purchase specialized bolts to secure the tv to my existing flat screen mount. Fortunately I have a hardware store nearby, and it was easy to find what I needed. I agree with other reviews that the screws need to be a tad longer than what is specified in the owner's manual. I used four M8 1.25 pitch screws at 30 mm length. Depending on your mount, this may or may not be the proper length for you.  * Once powered up, I found the remote control to be very simple, and surprisingly intuitive. I give the remote 4 stars for two reasons: the buttons are not back-lit or visible at all in the dark, and the remote is small and black which means I lost it three times in one night of viewing.  * The quality of the graphics are very good. As noted in other reviews, the screen is very reflective which can be bothersome for daytime viewing. I would have included a picture, but the tv behaved like a mirror and I didn't want to post a selfie. ;)  * The smart features were very intuitive, and highly functional. Within minutes I had set up access for YouTube, Netflix, Amazon Prime, Disney+ and HBO Max. This was the main reason for me to upgrade from my 55"" Samsung screen, which was nearly 10 yrs old.  * I plugged in my Chromecast, and the TV recognized it and began offering Google Assistant as a voice command option (in addition to the native Alexa and Bixby options).  * I still haven't figured out how to get Ambient mode working. It isn't important for me anyway, so I gave up. I may try again in the future out of morbid curiosity.  * I have a separate Sony stereo receiver with bookshelf speakers. I plugged in the optical cable and HDMI, and it worked immediately. The two devices ""talk"" to each other, so I only need to use the remote that came with the TV.Overall, I am very happy with this purchase. The interface is now much simpler than what I had before. I'm a tech person by trade, so the added complexity I used to deal with didn't bother me, but my wife was not able to operate the tv without my help. With this new setup, she feels much more comfortable operating it on her own.

",4.0 ,Northpoint,"Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2020","









  
  
    
  We went from a 15 year old tv to this model. Quite a bit has changed :) . The TV is decent. I hear a lot of reviews about ads popping up. I dont have that. So, Perhaps they are complaining about free TV like Pluto or Amazon prime.Pros: I like how easy it is to set things up. It auto detects a lot of things. Its well packaged and came undamaged. There are a lot of built in options for other services and the menus are easy to navigate. I really do not have any major issues with the TV. It turns on fast too.Cons: Well, The remote is a bit small. Thats not really any type of deal breaker though.One comment from people is that the screen is not bright. Well, Our house is not real bright so I do not notice the issue at all. One thing that did trip me up was hooking up to our comcast box. I had a blurry picture when attached by antenna cable from the box to the TV. The answer is to use an HDMI cable from the cable box to the TV. Solved that problem right away.Because the TV is 65"" you will need a decent stand. Its not heavy its just the legs are about 46"" apart. So, We were off to walmart at night to pick up a new tv stand. The TV weighs in at about 40 lbs. Not bad. I can pick it up easily to move it around. Thats pretty nice since our older one is about 100 lbs and takes two to move it.The screen is not a mat finish so there is some reflection probably in a well lit room. However, As I stated ours is not all that well lit. So not an issue.If your looking for a decent TV then you might like this one. Once again, I have not had any issues with the TV crashing or having to restart or ads. It runs perfectly fine.

  I've purchased many Samsung TVs over the past several years with no complaints. Recently bought the 50-inch version of this TV and returned it TWICE. I thought the first one was just a random defective unit only to discover when I received a replacement, the next one was just as bad with the same issues. Are they sending the rejects out because of the rush on electronic devices due to the pandemic or is this particular Samsung UHD TU-8000 Series model really that bad?!First of all the picture is WAY too DARK with no way to make it lighter no matter how many adjustments I tried in the settings. Forget watching even with a light on in the room. It NEVER gets brighter.Secondly, the $%! Samsung TV Plus application NEVER stops ""downloading content"". And when I try to access it to view the channels it crashes and I get an error that says ""There was a problem while trying to play the Samsung TV Plus Channel. Check your network settings or try again later."" (see photo) Well there is nothing wrong with my network settings and after repeated later attempts it still does not connect.I will say that I like the way the feet attach providing a sturdy support vs other brands and the remote is fine (as opposed to the LG Magic Remote which is ridiculous in my opinion). I really tried to give this Samsung TV a chance but unfortunately there are way too many problems. Excellent Amazon customer service for returns is the only positive thing I can say about this experience.

  I just bought a new house and was looking at efficient ways to furnish it, including several new big-screen TVs. So looking at Amazon I saw several awesome deals on Samsung TVs. They were delivered very quickly and pretty easy to unbox and set up. The instructions were clear, and initially I was pretty jazzed to have gotten a great deal on a solid TV. Unfortunately it didn't stay great. I have had to call technical support several times. The SMART functionality on this really isn't... smart that is. I have to reset my network every day so it will pick up my Internet, which as a strong router signal about ten feet away from the TV. My other TVs pick up the signal fine, but this one is a pain. Every time I talk to Samsung technical support they tell me to reset the network and insist I shouldn't have to do it again. But every time I turn it off it loses connection. Sadly unimpressed, as much with tech support as I am with the TV itself. It seems like that would be a pretty easy thing to make happen, but it seems like this has been a problem consistently for years with Samsung. I'd love to love the TV, but I'd love it a lot better if I could just watch it without jumping through hoops... every day...

  I thought a Samsung TV produced in 2020 with all the buzzwords (uhd, crystal, etc) would undoubtedly be better than a 2017 off the shelf “big box” store tv which was the same price. Imagine my disappointment.Right out of the box you can tell this was cheaply made. The housing/casing frame for the TV is really poorly made. The worst I’ve ever seen actually. When plugging a cable in- whether it’s an HDMI cable or the optical cable- it becomes apparent. The best way to describe it is like a phone case that’s slightly too big for your phone.The picture quality is my biggest gripe. I really can’t get over how the picture is unquestionably worse than my 3 year old LG. I’d honestly send this back but obviously that’s a nightmare I don’t want to deal with.The remote is garbage. In their quest to make it ergonomic they forgot to make it functional.You will be disappointed. There are a million other TVs out there. Try to check them out in a store before buying if you can.***Update.  After two months I lowered my rating from 3 stars to 1.  Apps (Hulu, Netflix, YouTube) constantly crash causing the TV to restart itself.  The layout/format design of scrolling through the functions on the TV has become increasingly irritating. I thought I would get use to it, but instead I'm just over it.  This TV is absolute garbage.  Hands down the worst TV I've ever bought. I will never buy another Samsung TV because of it.  *****

  I've had this TV for a few weeks now, and can say that while I like the physical aspects of the TV and sound bar (picture, audio, form factor), the user experience is flat awful.- There is a ""sponsored content"" section on the MAIN MENU that you can't remove.- The TV setup includes several non-skippable sections that try and consistently fail to recognize attached devices, force you to establish a Samsung account, and pre-configure your Home Screen with apps you don't want.- The ""built-in"" apps take up about half the available space, and can't be removed, whether or not you actually want any of them.- If an HDMI device can't be recognized, the Home Screen puts up a large banner inviting you to rerun the initial setup again. This banner can't be removed.- The remote and app interface is VERY sluggish at the best of times, and will occasionally bog down to being nearly unresponsive.My attempts to rectify some of this with Samsung support have been fruitless. Using the TV's support menu, I requested a callback. They did call, but only to immediately place me on hold for 30 minutes before hanging up. Samsung.com support chat is a series of unhelpful canned responses and not actual support. Next step will be to try and schedule an in-home appointment, but I hate for that to be necessary.

",3.0 ,Coco Pazzo,"Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  After several days with this set, I find that while the set itself is adequate, I cannot say the same for the remote.  Sure, it is smart enough to assist in the setup of other devices and control them with only one remote.  But first you have figure out how it operates.  I want to add my experience thus far with Alexa Inside.  She may be inside, but despite over two hours talking to Samsung who finally referred me to Amazon, she is still ""inside.""  The only Voice Command I was able to use is ""Alexa, turn off the tv.""  That's it, no Pause, no Lower Volume, Change Channel, etc.  Ridiculous.  My trouble began before I even got the set out of the box.  The remote and the ""user manual"" were right up top, the first things you could remove from the box.  So I sat down with the manual and remote, and took the two batteries that were included and attempted to open the back of the remote.  Fifteen minutes later, with no success on what should have been a very simple task, I resorted to using a thin bladed instrument to part the top from the bottom, and then inserted the batteries.  Once the set was up and operational, I picked up the remote and attempted to determine what the buttons controlled.  In some instances, I felt like you needed the hands of a safecracker to navigate the various menus, esp. when a seemingly logical act brought up a very different result on the screen.  I even phoned Samsung Support, twice, and wasted well over an hour total, dealing with a Virtual Chat (because you can't speak to a human).  The manual itself is almost totally useless, and as a result there are several websites devoted to the Samsung remote. Not created by Samsung, of course.  So bottom line, TV set: 4, Remote: 1.  Support: 0.

For the price, I'll live with the slight blur. Samsung has always been my ""go-to"" and has not changed. Cheap TV but high quality.4/21/202 Update:I received the replacement last week on Monday 4/13 and have had it in use for almost a week now with no issues. Great picture and decent sound. Some of the blacks look a little distorted but I would expect that with a model this cheap. Cant get much better for the price!I have always bought Samsung (and will continue to do so) but this TV must have been a dud. I received it Monday April 6th and today April 8th the TV is defective. It worked great with some blurring for the first few hours of being active. In the middle of playing a game the screen went white with pixilated colors. It would not turn off and now after unplugging it it will not turn back on. I reordered a replacement and Amazon being the amazing company it is, is sending me a replacement free of charge. I'll leave an update a few days after using the replacement.

  You get what you pay for -- I know a few people have complained about this tv.  But I love it.  Of course, I never pay top dollar and buy the latest and greatest because I feel I can do without some of the latest options.  I mean, when would I have a need for 8K?  I use it in my bedroom to watch a few evening shows if my husband has the other television tied up with something I don't care to watch.  But overall, it is a great tv.  Color is great.  It bluetoothed to a better speaker setup.  It works with Alexa.  Maybe I'd have liked a few more options for apps.  But overall, it works great with my Dish Satellite and a bluetooth speaker.

    Versa Mounting Bolt Size Problems
  
",1.0 ,Richard C. Guglomo,"Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  The manual offers no help in finding the size bolts that fit the VESA mounting holes in the back of the TV.  Went to Samsung's site and they said that M8 20mm to 22mm were recommended.  Well 22mm M8 bolts were not stocked.  22mm is an unusual length.  I bought 4 M8 20mm.  They do not fit.  The TV requires 22mm size. Any larger will require washers to offset the extra length.  I will return to the store and purchase 4 M8 25mm bolts with 16 washers.  That should do it.  To say I am pi..ed is an understatement.  Now I have to return to a store where nobody wears a mask and they will not adhere to social distancing.  Thank you Covid-19.I will update this review after I get the TV installed. But they will not get a 5 star review.  This is intolerable.  It has taken me 4 hours of screwing around that were unnecessary.  Put the bolt size in the manual and make sure the size is one normally stocked at hardware stores in the US of A.  Come on Samsung you are better than this.  Although it must happen a lot.So my recommendation is M8 25mm or 26mm with washers to offset the depth to prevent over tightening them and breaking something inside that will defeat the warranty.  Good luck.

Looked forward to using Bluetooth to export sound but it didn't work long enough to get there. Remote and software were a definite step down from Roku  on my other TVs.  On second day I had to log in again....like 4 times over the course of 2 hours. Unplugged it numerous times. Lasted till halftime; had to read the score in the paper. Returned it via Amazon; very quick, no problem. Probably should have taken the replacement option...what's the chance of two lemons, but I was gun shy of Samsung at that point.

  This was a huge upgrade for me, I've had a 37 in vizio for the past 6 years and pulled the trigger on this 50 in 4k smart tv and wow, what an upgrade. Easy to use and set up, syncs with my galaxy seamlessly. Very good contrast ratios, bright whites, dark blacks, and good colors. It's not the brightest tv, so if it will get used in a sunny room this may not be the TV for you. It also has a ""feature"" called global dimming, if there's a bright object on a dark screen then it darkens the rest of the screen for contrast and can make some scenes very dark. Not a deal breaker but something to keep in mind.

    Do Not Buy - Horrible Remote Control, no 3.5 mm Audio Out
  
",1.0 ,BaltoBill,"Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  Do not buy this !!  It has a horrible remote control, AND - it has ONLY an optical audio output jack, no 3.5 mm plug audio output for my existing excellent speakers.  If you purchase a digital optical converter, the remotes (Samsung and FIOS) no longer control the optical output volume - you have to do that at your speakers.  I personally consider it very poor that when you use external speakers, the TV remotes no longer allow any volume control.  Yet another reason not to buy this Samsung.I have already invested in a excellent set of powered external speakers (R,L, plus Woofer) and all I need is a 3.5 mm jack, but the Samsung TU8000 UNBELIEVABLY does not provide this.  They have a nice modern optical output, but not any simple 3.5 mm jack.  So I need a $25 converter, or new set of optically connected speakers (which are overkill for my office/computer room)Additionally, the Samsung TU8000 remote control is ""minimalist"" taken to the extreme.  Even if you use your phone for the TV and Samsung ""Smart Things"" app - I do not think my phone is acceptable to use as a TV remote for common frequent changes.  Even if you stream with YouTube, as you know, most streaming apps are clumsy on navigation.  I expect even a minimalist TV remote to be capable and clear about basic functions, and this Samsung TV remote for the Crystal UHD TU-8000 Series - 4K UHD HDR Smart TV is way, way over the top at being far too minimalist.  Super tiny - only about 10 keys total.  I will never buy another Samsung unless the ad shows a picture of the TV remote and it is ""fully functional"".  Unbelievably horrible inadequate remote control design.

  We have always bought Samsung TV's and never had any problems with them.  Three days in to buying new TV - it was working well.  Color & picture was very good, sound great etc.  I'm a little on the fence about the high DEF picture though.  I'm not sure if that's the TV or Comcast.  Another family member has a Samsung TV & they have Direct TV - their high DEF is super! Turned on TV this morning and had some inverted colors on TV.  Checked settings and nothing had changed.  Googled to see what this was.  Contacted Samsung Tech Support - the issue was fixed quickly with a ""SOFT"" RESET.  Tech Support had me do the following for the inverted color problem.""Hold POWER button until TV goes off and comes back on; release power button"" - problem fixed.Concern - Is a ""soft reset"" normal for a 3 day old TV - I don't think so.  I've had to do a soft reset on a Samsung cellphone several years back.  I had continuous issues after the soft reset.  I hope review helps others - hopefully it's an isolated problem.

",2.0 ,Soundcastle,"Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  Picture quality is good after some adjustments, mainly turning off motion smoothing and agressive contrast reduction. This needs to be done independently for every streaming service/app.Most unfortunately, there are unremovable ads on the menu you have to use to navigate the system. The menu is sluggish as a whole, some partner apps are also unremoveable (Apple TV, etc.) but can at least be removed from the home screen.They tried to get too cute with the remote and it is all form and no function, there is a button that pulls up a menu of what should be physical buttons. You have to press it twice to get to the menu of ""color buttons"" that most apps seem to expect a Samsung smart tv to have. (I.e. Green to add Amazon Prime Video movie to watchlist)I'm tempted to hook a Roku stick up to this to bypass all of Samsung's aggravating design choices and anti-consumer practices. I have a Sharp smart tv with built-in Roku and it is infinitely easier and more enjoyable to use.

  this is supposed to be an awesome 4k TV, it's not. it only shows what it wants. It will only let you into NetFlix or Amazon Prime if you buy a new subscription. I have a Fire Stick, but there is no way to tell it to switch input. The manuals are useless. It says hit the home button on the remote, then hit the settings button, but there is no settings button. Thinking of donating it to Covenant House, and eating what I paid for it. Oh, and btw, though I got it in December, Samsung no longer supports. And if you hit the button on their sight that says learn more, you end up at an HP support site. I'll go back to Isignia or LG!

    Can't beat it for the price -- from a casual Xbox Gamer
  
",5.0 ,Kyle Logue,"Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  So I spent a lot of time researching Samsung Televisions.  I'm loyal to the brand and won't buy any other as I truly believe others are inferior.  My TV space only allows for up to a 50"" television, so I was comparing both the Q60T and this model.  I primarily use my tv for gaming via my Xbox One.  My previous TV was a Best Buy special and was not a smart TV.  My biggest concern was that I wanted something that would be an upgrade in quality to what I had.  I went back and forth between this model and the Q60T.  I ended up buying this one and could not be happier.  The 4k upscaling on my regular Xbox One made games look immensely better.  I didn't have to do anything other than enabling gaming mode and it looked great.  I anticipate upgrading to the Xbox Series X, once it's back in stock, to fully utilize the 4k experience, but even as is, I can tell a huge difference in the display's overall picture quality.  Samsung is becoming known for its QLED TVs, but I would say that if you're in a similar situation as me, wait for those to come down in price before adopting.

  First off I've always been a big fan of Samsung TV's so read this with a ""grain-of-salt"".Compared to the 40"" it replaces I'd rather have the 40"", but I love the extra 3"" with the 43"". Samsung keeps going further down the rat-hole with their Smart TV arrangement and limited button remote. It makes getting to adjustments more inconvenient then it was in the past. While I think the speak-to-me remote is a neat idea; their recording/tracking everything said is not so neat. If it stayed with the TV I'd use it, but it doesn't so I don't. However, their are those of you how don't care if you privacy is given away for free.I read a few comprehensive reviews and I'd agree with them if this will be a primary TV. If like in my case its a bedroom TV its more then good enough. Also, if you are use to Samsung's control/feature arrangement it still almost the same. And for those of you who know how to think, unlike my w...if...e gads, it easy to figure out.In summary, poorly implemented Smart Feature, Great picture of a common TV, simple remote does lots of functions with so few buttons.

  This is a very good budget TV, which can be completely Ad-free if  you don't tick the box next to ""Interest-based Advertisement Service"" during the initial setup of the TV. We are using Roku on all our home TVs (all four are Samsung models), so interactions with the Samsung TV remote are minimal.The TV design is sleek, although more expensive models tend to look more ""futuristic"" than this one. The picture quality is really good (the only Samsung TV at home that has a slightly better picture is a MU7000 model). The TV menus load quickly and browsing is easy. The sound is good and can be connected to an external Bluetooth speaker. The provided HDMI ports (3) should be enough to connect a Roku/other streaming device, a video game console, and perhaps a Blu-ray player. You could tweak the default settings further to enhance your viewing experience by googling the optimal picture, etc. settings for this model. I personally prefer to set the picture to ""Dynamic"" mode to get brighter colors and better contrast. There is also an ""Ambient"" mode (and there is a button on the remote for it) that has some novel solutions for blending in with your room decor.The TV comes preloaded with Alexa and Bixby, but if you are worried about privacy issues, you can skip activating either of them.Overall, at this price level, this is a very well made TV and is worth buying if you are on a budget.

  I had the prior model of this tv.  I got this one thinking it’d be the same but they made a bunch of dumb design decisions that’s made this significantly worse!  Notably, the remote control is a mess with a big ‘ambient’ button you’ll NEVER use now replacing what used to be the SOURCE button.  We use the source button all the time to switch to Apple TV and other devices, but now you need to navigate through a cumbersome interface and menu just to switch to our PS4.  Give us back the source button!And Ambient mode??? This changes your tv to match the color of the light in your room.  What??  Who would ever want a big glowing rectangle to use as what, a night light?  This is now the most prominent button on the remote and you’ll accidentally hit it all the time turning your tv into a big glowing useless box until you navigate back to tv mode.Also, they changed the digital audio input on the back.  In the previous model it was horizontal to the back so you could plug in a speaker and still have the tv flush against the wall.For some unimaginable and dumb reason they moved audio input to the other side of the tv (away from all the other wires making it harder to corral all your wires) AND they made it plug in perpendicularly (ie at a tight angle to the back of the tv instead of flush).  This makes it really hard to plug anything in and still have it flush with the wall.This and other dumb ‘smart tv’ menu designs have made this a real step backwards from the previous model which was just simpler and more intuitive.Picture is nice, but I think most TVs in this price range look good these days.  It’s the other things like menu and remote design and port design that makes or breaks the experience, and this model fails the test.

First, I got a dead on arrival TV screen because the UPS person was not doing their job correctly from what I saw when they took it out of the truck. Contacted Amazon and they were an amazing help because they sent the replacement out right away and had the UPS person come to my house the next to take the broken TV away. Got my replacement TV a day after that and it has been working flawlessly ever since. Thanks to the amazing Customer Service team from Amazon for being so understanding! If you are looking for a 40-50 inch Smart TV then why not go for this one since it has 4K HDR quality also. Works with the PS5 also perfectly fine but I would like to remind you it is not 50 inch as stated just a little smaller but it’s still pretty huge for a bedroom TV.

  Constantly loses wifi signal. Have had to reset the television 4 times in the month since it was installed. Moved the router across the house so it is only a few feet away and it still is spotty. Live TV on any app doesn’t work. Sometimes it just won’t come on at all, and we have to unplug/replug it to get it to work. Our older Samsung across the house has no issues at all connecting.This model seems like a bit of a dud.

    A decent TV with a terrible remote

  This is a decent TV for the money. Picture quality is decent enough, and the sound is pretty good. And it even supports Bluetooth headphones like AirPods. The Smart features are great and I like TV Plus, and I can have it on a wired network connection to reduce interference (but it also supports Wi-Fi).Now for the negatives:The remote is AWFUL. The only benefits to it are voice search and not having to point it at the TV, since it’s Bluetooth. It looks like they tried to copy Roku and Apple and took away almost all the buttons. You can tell they failed at remote design because the TV displays a tutorial on how to use the remote when you’re setting it up. The good news is that this TV is compatible with any recent Samsung IR remote, so I bought a more traditional one.Also... if you play video games on this TV, they look good but make sure you turn Game Mode on. Otherwise the lag is horrendous. Unlike my old TV, Game Mode seems to get turned off every time I put my Switch away.Also, get a TV stand. I use a Perlesmith stand. The stupid feet this comes with limit where you can put the TV.Overall, though, it’s a pretty good TV for the money.

  The Good: great picture, very intuitive remote, lightweight so easy to hang on the all, small bezelThe Bad: shipped saying Ambient mode would display your own pictures but took 3 months of begging for them to make it happen on my .... iPhone 6The Ugly: the Tizen OS often does not get apps written until last or never gets themAdded note: So after 9 months I still like the quality of my TV but wished it did not lose connection with the home network when it went into standby mode. When you turn it on, it can't find the network and so you have to hard reboot the TV. Not a huge deal but this is 2020...nearly 2021Bottom line: not a bad purchase but I think equivalent TCL's will give you more bang for your buck.

He waited another week and then called them back and they stated that it was not covered by warranty and he would have to order the part which was an additional 900 dollars due to he damaged it.  Here we are in August still no part (they have rescheduled many times).  I feel that since he only had the TV a few weeks that the company should of fixed it and not made him pay.

  First thing i did was watch the Marvel Universe in 4k.  Awesome!  I noticed some motion blur on a fast moving special  effect and at times it seems the picture would become very dark.

So far though i have no complaints.  For the cost, getting a really good 4k picture and plenty of features i feel good about my purchase.The only other thing i would say to prospective buyers is that you may need another set of hands to get the tv out of the box and put the stand pieces on.  There is almost no assembly but the size makes it a bit difficult to manage alone.

The UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT and CENTER buttons are so smooth that its difficult to tell what you're touching without looking at it.This remote is definitely not good for older people to navigate without constant frustration.Issue #2Before getting this TV, my other TV were made ""smart"" using Chromecast devices. From any phone on my wifi, all TVs could be cast to from and streaming app. NOW with this TV on the system, some TV(Chromecast) combos don't show up on various streaming apps. Although several of my TVs have streaming apps built into the TV, I was happily Chromecasting everything.With the addition of this new TV that I'm not using with a Chromecast, the whole seamless streaming experience is kinda ruined.

    Too ""smart"" for an HTPC or gaming display, but if you are willing to fight you can make it work
  
",3.0 ,John Lilley,"Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  TLDR; If you just want to turn on the TV, have it be in control and do whatever it does, you'll be fine. But if you step off the narrow path of Samsung-centric experience, you are in for a rotten time.There is a pitched battle afoot for supreme control of the AV experience, and we consumers are the innocent bystanders, watching in horror as what was once a simple activity (say, watching TV, or playing a computer game) becomes yet another bafflingly-complex high-tech gauntlet to be endured rather than enjoyed.  My experience is attempting to make a new HTPC (Intel NUC) connect via new Denon receiver, to this TV.  I chose these components because they are reasonably high-quality latest technology and thus likely to support all of the HDMI 4k standards, and are well-reviewed.The nature of the problem became apparent immediately. Connecting my PC HDMI directly  to the TV resulted in a ""Recognizing input"" screen on the TV, which takes nearly a minute, and fails, then asks you what the input is.  Because the TV apparently doesn't know PCs.  So I dutifully told it ""this is a PC on HDMI1"", and everything looked fine.  But every time I rebooted the PC or changed video modes (desktop-gaming-netflix) the TV wanted to recognize it again and again. Despite this setback, I connected it via the Denon and marched on. The receiver is a lot better about just coping with whatever signal it gets, so that was a relief.  But now the TV part of things got worse. Turning the receiver on or off, or switching inputs, sent the TV into fits of ""recognizing"" the input, which always failed, and now would now and then lead to the dread ""no signal"" on the TV, which was fixable by unplugging and replugging the HDMI.So I started wondering ""why does the TV need to recognize the device"".  It's just a TV, and it should display what it is given. Some research suggests that this is all due to Samsung's desire to make its TV and OneRemote the center of your AV world.  You can attach a keyboard and mouse to your TV!  Your TV streams Netflix and Amazon!  Your TV streams video from all sorts of other sources of terrible quality and dubious curation. Your TV wants to show you Mariah Carey's holiday special. But in order to do that, it must take control of everything. This would be OK except that, when the Samsung engineers devised their strategy for world AV domination, they left out the part about HOW IT HAS TO ACTUALLY WORK.  And it has to work without standing on one leg and holding the antenna just so.  Which is basically what I'm up against.By now I was getting that sinking feeling that I've made a terrible mistake.  Yes, I could return both the TV and receiver, because Amazon is quite generous that way. But... what a pain in the behind, and what a terrible waste. I had yet to call Samsung support, because I absolutely hate working my way up the call center hierarchy, and I'd read a few things about this problem which concluded with ""Samsung support was no help at all"".  So I started frantically researching every Samsung forum I could find, and I eventually stumbled across this gem.  I am not making this up.  Using the OneRemote, I entered the cheat code MUTE-VOLUEMDOWN-CHANNELDOWN-MUTE. Without giving any feedback, this apparently disables the ""Recognizing Input"". Samsung completely disavows this hack, and it is not supported.  Use at your own risk.Nonetheless, I've decided to run with this Rube Goldberg machine I've been building. But I disabled the TV's internet because I didn't want it getting firmware auto-update and deciding that it REALLY didn't support the unsupported cheat code any more. I've managed to suppress, for now, the occasional instance of ""no signal"" by programming my Logitech Harmony to add a 5-second delay between the power-on of the receiver and PC, and the power-on of the TV.  I'm kind of holding my breath, hoping nothing breaks for a while.Regarding picture quality, which I at first rated rather poorly.  My wife and I immediately noticed that the colors were weirdly eye-popping on Great British Bake Off on netflix.  And when watching Pride and Prejudice, which she has seen several times, she remarked that the picture seemed all wrong.  That's when we found ""FilmMaker Picture Mode"", which I'll just call ""The Picture Mode That Everyone Wanted In the First Place"".  Once again, the TV is too smart for its own good.  Why does it need to color-correct and resharpen a 4K picture that's already been optimized by the creator? After disabling the picture correction, it looks pretty good.  But did that disable some great feature I might want like HDR?  I don't really know.PS: Gaming Mode is utterly useless to me. It kind of worked at first, but now it just sends the TV into the despairing ""no signal"" mode.  Perhaps if I hadn't suppressed the Input Recognition it would have worked, but ... Input Recognition breaks when connected to a PC.  Catch-22.PPS: I have tried every high-bandwidth HDMI cable/connector I could find, including fiber-optic and HBaseT extender.  They are no help in this experience, although the HBaseT extender made it worse, probably due to delays in the startup/connect sequence.I was at one point really tempted by the commercial displays (also Samsung) that lack all of the smartness: https://smile.amazon.com/Samsung-BE70T-H-Software-Speakers-LH70BETHLGFXGO.  If you look at its reviews, you'll see that all the one-star reviews are ""no smart apps"".  If you are wanting to do HTPC/gaming, this is worth checking out first.

  We have 4 Samsung's smart TVs, so I hate that they changed the remote. The sound was not fantastic for our long narrow livingroom, so we did end up buying a sound bar/subwoofer. The picture and the color quality is fantastic. It comes with Samsung TV which I've never had before, so it's nice to have some sort of tv aside from Hulu, Disney+, Netflix, and Prime. As far as the brightness I kept reading and worrying about- this TV has an Ambient mode, and in ambient mode the color and picture and brightness are greatly affected because that's the idea of it being a softer darker picture quality. We don't use ambient mode, because we want the usual bright picture quality. We've watched older tv shows, 4K tv shows, the kids play the ps4 on it, and it's all been great. It has HDMI and AV input on the back.

  The picture quality is good with options to get the kind of picture you want. The remote is easy to hold and use. I used to use TV Ears with my old TV so my wife could listen to the volume she wanted.  This set has no RCA out jacks to connect it to.  The solution was to get a sound bar, which does put out better sound than the TV speakers, while I connect my wireless headphones to the bluetooth on the TV.  I am using Roku to get my streaming channels because the TV won't let me put Philo into the program list. Also the glossy screen picks up glare from lights that are in line with the screen. I have heard this is a common problem with most cheaper sets.

  Excellent TV—clear picture, easy to use. I don’t know what the other reviews were complaining about regarding brightness because it is perfectly bright. The one thing to know is that for the smart features to work, you need a STRONG and steady wi-fi signal. We needed to purchase a wi-fi extender in order to get this to work; our router is on a different floor of our average size house and the signal (3 “bars” on a phone) was not strong enough for the TV.

  I have loved Samsung TVs in general. My order was returned as it was damaged in transit but I am looking at ordering another one to replace it. My review is not specific to this model because of this.Samsung has long been my favorite because of the picture quality and easy of use. The remotes have been easy to navigate but with that said I am not familiar with the very clean looking remote of this tv. We use Apple/Kodi streaming boxes on all our TVs even though our newer ones are smart TVs with app availability. We currently have 2 Samsung, TCL, and Vizio and the Samsung’s are far easier to program and a nicer CLEAN interface.I have not used the setup app as my other TVs didn’t require it but before I knew this one was damaged I did DL it and it does seem fairly easy to navigate.I love that TVs now offer “game mode” switching for all HDMI so it’s easy to switch between things connected via HDMI, simply turn on the device and the TVs switch to them.One problem with too many TVs is the lack of enough HDMI ports, only a few offer more than 3 so this means an HDMI switcher may be required by people with multiple devices to connect.

  75” beauty. The Sanyo remote is lacking, as usual. The remotes for their 40” TVs are much better. This TV is connected to a Fios DVR. Overnight, it had to be rebooted as it defaulted to 480i and didn’t think the TV was 4K. This is actually the reason I bought this TV. It wouldn’t even connect to the TV it replaced. The Smart set-up was a breeze. Each app gave access to a code that could be entered on a smart device. Not having to enter passwords with a remote is excellent. The picture quality is very nice for the price.

  I had considered this 65 inch tv and the Qled. I saw the picture at a Best Buy and thought it to be fantastic. The Qled was amazing too but I didn’t feel it was worth $400 more. This picture is so crystal clear I can see the grain of the grass when watching a golf tournament. I love to watch TCM movies , the old movies are so clear with this tv that it seems like the actors are actually in your room. Some dislikes , not crazy the way the app bar is shown across the bottom of the screen, they are small and hard to tell which one is highlighted. Also I just wish I could get rid of many apps I don’t want, but Samsung has some  you just can’t delete. Instructions with the tv were only for installation, hardly any operating instructions on paper. I also thought it was difficult setting up as you have to go online and start a Samsung account . I couldn’t get the Bixby to work for voice so I used Alexa which works great. The remote is pretty basic but does a good job, I can use it for Xfinity/ Comcast, but found it easier just to use the Comcast remote, and use the Samsung remote for apps and controlling my Firestick. Only other thing is it would have been easier if the tv had a stand with a platform instead of legs. Legs are ok but I had to make a new tabletop to accommodate the width of the legs.  Overall the tv is awesome.

  After initial excitement, I started seeing a white patch, very noticeable, on the right side of the screen. I started feeling like looking through a dirty window.  On a 12 years old LCD TV, which this one was replacing, the picture was better.  I am not interested so much in the “smart” features, if I have discomfort watching the picture.  In the absence of these “smart” features, I can connect the Firestick or a smartphone. I would like to know, what should I connect in the absence of a good picture.  Some reviews tell how good is the picture on different type of TV technology, OLED. Is it just another way of saying how bad the picture on this type of TV is? Or did picture quality requirements go down?  12 year old LCD TV had better picture. This TV’s picture quality did not even get close.

  I have read in other reviews the problems with darkness and have encountered some of that; but not widespread so I am assuming that to be the actual program I am watching. Otherwise the clarity of the picture is phenomenal. Remote and general smart set up is a bit cumbersome. The included apps are limited and those that are tend to be, well, pathetic. I am constantly resetting the AT&T app because of slow response or ""channel not available, try later"" messages. I had a problem with it holding the current time and I have to say Samsung's CS was very helpful, but the AT&T app, as well as MLB are pathetic. I have Fire TV sticks and cubes on other TV's in the house and they operate far more smoothly. Also a very limited selection of available apps. About to give up and order a new Cube for it.

  Pros:  - The picture quality is quite good, but nothing that will blow you away.  - The thin frame looks nice.Cons:  - The TV does not get very bright and it's quite reflective, so it's not good for daytime watching.  - The smart interface software is so bad that it crashes and freezes on a daily basis.  - The voice control for the remote doesn't even work as you would expect it would, for example: inputting searches on AppleTV do not work with the Voice input.  - The remote has no backlight and the buttons have no distinguishing features and a few of the buttons are completely useless.  For example: there's no button for the TV settings, in order to get to the TV Settings you just hit the Home Button and then Click Left SIX TIMES, passing an advertisement every single time, yet I have some completely useless multi-color input button and an ambient mode button, both of which I'll never use.  - The advertisements that pop up when you hit the home button are permanent.  That is so annoying, why did I PAY to see advertisements every single time I use my TV?  - The inputs on the back are impossible to use if you wall mount the TV unless you remove the TV from the wall, even for the USB inputs, one of the HDMI ports even points towards the wall so I can't even plug anything into it unless I buy a 90 degree HDMI cable.Honestly, I did not expect a TV designed in 2020 to be anywhere near this bad.  By far the worst ""Con"" is the smart interface crashing, freezing and updating on a regular basis.  I'm really hoping this is only due to the fact that this is a brand new TV, but even if that's fixed I would still only be rating this TV as maybe a 3/5.  As it stands however, I'm seriously considering returning this thing because it's so frustrating.

  The specs on this are confusing because this Amazon page does not correspond to the specs on other websites. For instance it says 60 fps here but 120 fps elsewhere. After research the 55"" and larger are 120 fps, the smaller are 60 fps. Also it notes 2 HDMI here and 3 elsewhere. I believe this is also to do with the size of the television you bought but not sure. Even when viewing a 55"" or larger tv the compare feature here is still showing for their smaller versions.This has lead to a lot of ""I didn't know this was 60 fps when I bought it but I can't tell"" because it is actually 120 if 55"" or larger.Hope this helps, look up the stats elsewhere.Besides this the tv is great, the colors are amazing compared to a normal tv but the RU8000 has a deeper color palette. Basically this is the economy version of the RU8000 but performs very well. It does very well, maybe even the best in it's class for 4k. The input lag is very low so this could be used for gaming very easily. The gaming mode actually scores better than the movie picture mode in most reviews. The initial settings will need to be tweaked to run this at it's full potential. Just look up online the best setting than your good to go. After being optimized this tv scored a 9.0 for 4k TV's, pre-optimized settings it scored a 7.9

  Got it yesterday set it up last night setup was pretty easy.  I was a little wary of a couple of things, the details on amazon weren't really clear on whether there was Samsung tv plus and also if the T.V. was YouTube TV app capable.  The answer to both questions is yes, they are both available when I looked through the apps during initial setup I couldn't find Youtube T.V. app, but after I was done with the setup and was surfing through the Samsung tv plus channel lineup I decided to check in all apps went to search type in ""YOUTUBE TV"" and bam, there it was downloaded it (which was pretty quick all things considered like internet speeds slowing done due to the ""epidemic"").  I was able to get Alexa all setup except tried to use the drop-in feature from my cell phone at work today to talk to my wife at home but wouldn't work.  Not sure what's wrong but I Have spent the last 3 years buying 1 tv per room in my home In my son's room I have a 40 in. Samsung 4k 2018 model, In the living room a 2019 model Samsung 55in. I think its NU7200 model number, and now this year this tv for my wife and I's room. I will post some pics later I love the new remote its a lot slimmer than the previous kind and seems to load up apps when you turn it on pretty quick and was nice I setup my commute to work and was able to just ask Alexa on the remote how long might drive would be and best way to get there and it got me to work in half the time it usually takes me!!  I will keep this updated with anything good or BAD in the future.

  I really like this TV overall and am happy with my purchase. I ran some 4K demo videos through the built-in YouTube app and the 4K picture is absolutely beautiful. The one minor gripe is that the blacks aren't truly black, as is the case with all LCD screens, but unless you're going to pony up the money for an OLED, that's just the way it's going to be. The sound quality is also quite good from the TV's built in speakers.I only have a couple of minor complaints overall about the TV. The first is that I'm not really a fan of the modern style ""minimalist"" remote. Call me old fashioned, but I would prefer to have a number pad, especially when using the built-in Spectrum TV app to watch my cable TV channels. But if it really bothers me that much I assume I could probably buy a universal remote to use with the TVMy other minor complaint is that I don't really like the ""stand"" that came with the TV. My old Samsung TV had a really nice swivel stand that allowed me to turn the TV from side to side, depending on where in the room I was sitting. This TV only has 2 ""feet"" for a stand, so no swiveling of the TV is really possible. Here again, I can probably remedy this by buying an after-market universal TV stand that will swivel if I want to.Overall I am very satisfied with this TV and would definitely recommend it. At under $400 it's a very good value.

  This tv is awesome. Thought it had 4 hdmi ports, but I bought a splitter so that should fix the problem. Games and movies look amazing. Also, if your soundbar is Samsung it will find or request to connect to the tv instantly.

  I really love this tv! The size, quality and smart features is just amazing, especially after waiting a long time to upgrade. I hung this tv on a tv console, and that was the most frustrating part for me, so I knocked a star off because it really should have better instructions. I had to do alot of online researching! This tv has vesa mounts which is good - the instructions say 20-22mm size m8.  I tried a 20mm m8 screw and it did not work. It turns out that is the length that you need to aim for INSIDE the tv, not the actual screw length. Do actual measurements, or take your best guess at it like I did. For the tv bracket that came with the console stand, I had to use a 25mm screw to accomodate the width of the bracket. The most frustrating part is that the tv has an irregular shape back and it is not mentioned anywhere, the bottom two vesa screws will need to be LONGER than the top two screws! I had to use an even longer screw coupled with a spacer under the bracket against the tv (as per the tv console instructions) to get the bottom screws to hold - the screw for that one was 45 mm and the math was 45 mm screw - 22 mm spacer = 23 mm then take that distance: 23 mm - you need minimum of 20mm inside of tv = gives 3mm space for bracket and washer. Also note that this tv does not come with ANY mounting screws or spacers, you should buy a mounting screw kit with various size screws, washers and spacers in addition to your tv bracket/console. I wasted a few hours on a weekend on figuring this out so hopefully my review helps at least one person. Also, if you plan to mount on a tv console, make sure that it can support your tv! After I bought this tv, I realized that my current console only supported up to 55 and I bought a 65!  I had to wait an additional 2 weeks with my tv on the floor while the new tv stand was being shipped, and then I had to build it! Sigh, this was a project and that was an unexpected expense for me. It was worth it at the end though.I also purchased the 43 inch, and that one DOES have a flat and not curved irregular back - I really love this tv too! Another note - for amazon video, on occasion I would see a ""something went wrong"" message. To fix this issue, I had to do a hard reboot by holding the power button for 10 seconds. If you have any issues with apps such as amazon, hulu, netflix, etc - in the settings, there is also an option to ""reinstall"" each app if needed.

  I used to own the Samsung MU6300 but in February it fell and the screen cracked. So when I was looking for a new TV I saw this one but it didn't have many reviews at the time nor positive ones. But I took a chance and I love the TV; the bezels are thinner and the picture is actually pretty good. They also have all the apps that I needed and use. I know some people have said it's too dark sometimes but I don't really have that problem day time or night; you can always switch the picture to dynamic anyways. Overall it's great and I'm glad I bought it.

  Purchased the Samsung 8 series TU8000 50”. After un-packing I found that the 50” I purchased was actual 44”. How’s that! The box is only 49” there no way with the foam protection the TV could be 50”.See pictures and video. This is a scam.I need my money or a 50” Samsung TV

  For the money, this TV really hard to beat.What most excited me about this TV is the sound. According to Samsung, this TV has woofers, which should help out with lower frequencies that have long been a weak spot of flat screen TVs. Having had the TV for a few days, I can confirm that it produces sound that I have never heard from a flat screen TV before. Don't expect it to shake your walls with strong low bass, but it's definitely an improvement to previous models. The lowest frequencies I can hear from it are somewhere in the 60-70Hz range.Picture quality is excellent. I get the impression that it is slightly improved compared to last year's already excellent offerings, although I don't have any equipment to measure this objectively. The TV can produce vibrant colors, gets very bright, and produces great contrast, and the settings allow you to adjust this to your liking. Some distortion of the colors when viewed at an angle is inherent in the technology, but even at wide angles, I wouldn't call it bothersome.The one thing about the TV that isn't great is thesoftware. The YouTube app stops playing video about once a day. Long pressing the back button will exit it, after which it can be restarted. The app will also show ads even when logged in to an account with a subscription to remove ads. The TV restarts every once in a while and shows ConTV, which often displays violence and can take a minute or so to navigate away from.The software can also be slow and unresponsive at times, particularly immediately after turning on the TV. Apps also take a while to load. This being the case when the TV is new does not bode well for the performance in the future when apps will undoubtedly be more demanding.Of course, you don't have to use the provided apps or menu bar if you just want to watch regular TV or if you run your software on an external device plugged into one of the TV's ports.Aside from the software problems, this is a great TV for not a lot of money. I am sure better picture quality, more processing power, and more HDMI ports can be had if you're willing to spend more, but for the money, this TV might very well be the best one out there.If you already have a recent model, is it worth upgrading? Compared to last year's RU8000, this TV definitely has better sound, I think the picture is ever so slightly better, but you get fewer HDMI ports (3 instead of 4) and my impression is that software runs less smoothly. Overall, I would keep using the RU8000 unless you really want the improved sound. Compared to older or lower specced models that already have slower processors and fewer HDMI ports, upgrading to the TU8000 is definitely worth it.Rated four stars to save my fifth star for a future TV with a faster processor and at least 4 ports. Other than that, this TV is excellent and I don't hesitate to recommend it.
