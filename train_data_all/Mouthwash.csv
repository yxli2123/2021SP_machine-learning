    Great IF you can stomach the taste
  
",3.0 ,KLS,"Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  This stuff works very well but I CANNOT STAND the taste... but then again I have never really like the taste of any listerine.HIGHLY recommend if you actually like Listerine's taste. (Probably one of the better tasting Listerine) but I DO NOT recommend if you can't handle a strong taste. I recommend Crest Pro Health Advanced Clean Mint flavor if you are not a fan of the taste of Listerine. (CPH is also recommended and given out at my mother-in-law's Dental Practice, so BOTH are EXCELLENT)

    Traditional mouthwash with fluoride
  
",5.0 ,newtopos,"Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2019","









  
  
    
  The other reviews are spot-on: this has a fairly strong, but not unpleasant burn (due to the alcohol), a pleasant flavor, and has fluoride.  We'll see what my dentist has to say at the next check-up, but I wanted to add a fluoride mouthwash to my regimen and this should do the trick.

",5.0 ,Flautalee,"Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  This mouthwash is recommended by my Family Dentist and Endodontist to help maintain my teeth by preventing further tooth decay.  Unlike some other mouthwashes, it does not burn the lining of my mouth.It is very important to me that a mouthwash not burn or damage the inside of my mouth because I am a flutist and a bagpiper.  I trust this product to help me because I trust my Dentists implicitly.

    Makes your mouth very fresh!
  
",5.0 ,Bev02,"Reviewed in the United States August 17, 2019","









  
  
    
  I've always used the regular Listerine, but with upcoming dentist appointment, I started using this. It is very minty if you don't brush your teeth first, but leaves your mouth very fresh. However, won't stay so fresh, if you didn't brush first. It is best when using after brushing. It will completely leave your mouth very fresh AND clean!

  This is a great deal for the size and cost. I like using it because it overall cuts back on tooth decay and brightens teeth. I have had many comments on how I can keep my teeth so white and really it's just the mouthwash. The flavor is great too and while it may be strong for some people I think that's part of what makes it work so well. Love it. Totally recommended.

",5.0 ,Zany Moonites,"Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  My great-grandma used Listerine for her breath and for her falsies.  It tasted nasty to me.  It no longer tastes nasty but it burns so you feel like somehow, it's working.  And it does-- mouth feels cleaner, fresher and I don't wake up with morning mouth.  All I can ask for AND it's pretty sitting on my sink.  As I said, it's Listerine-- I've never been tempted to use any other product.  See what early conditioning can do?

  I'll be the first to admit, I have terrible breath at times. However, when I use this product first thing in the morning and right before bed, I don't have the issues. This leaves your mouth feeling fresh and removes odor for the entire day (unless you eat something like garlic). Flavor is minty (or spicy for those of you out there) and does not have much of a burn feel. Overall, this is the product to get for fresh breath and I will continue to reorder it every time I am running low.

  As a recovering alcoholic. Some people get triggers that will send them back down the rabbit hole. My dog would hide the alcohol i have left in the house and when I couldn’t find any of daddy’s happy juice i went for the green listerene. It tasted like drinking green listerene. Not only was I fresh. I was drunkenly fresh. Now it’s easier for me to just brush my teeth since this is alcohol free and I don’t find the color purple appetizing.  So i would just feel stupid drinking this one.

I think some people received a different product altogether, maybe there are two versions? But this Total Care product has been great so far! I don’t use it for 1 minute exactly, maybe a little less?

    Very strong taste of alcohol
  
",2.0 ,,"Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  I am usually not a fan of mouthwash but I decided to try some after my dentist recommendation.I went for this one.Here is what I like about it:- Gives a sensation of cleanliness- Recommended by many dentists- Not very expensive.Here is what I like much less:- Very strong taste of alcohol. If you are not a drinker, it may bring you closer to being one since one of the distaste of non drinkers is the strong feel in the mouth.- I tried to put it in a an electric floss machine and it reacted weirdly by creating some crust everywhere.- You should not drink or eat anything 30mn after use and the aftertaste will remain for a while.- Fluoride can be poisoning if ingested in concentrations higher than 1.0 mg/L. Although Listerine only claims 0.02%, it still considers drinking it to be poisoning.- FD&C red no. 40, FD&C blue no. 1 are potential carcinogens.- Most bad breath issues are not coming from dental hygiene but from digestive issues... In clear, listenine may cover the bad scent the same way you could spread menthol on a piece of dung... It may cover partially but not fix the issue.In conclusion:I am still not feeling safe using it on a regular basis. Added to the awful feel with it in my mouth, I will keep on flossing and brushing my teeth. It has worked fine for me over the years.2 stars.

  Based on the great reviews, I started using twice a day, morning and night, and in the beginning it was great.  But after about 2 weeks I started getting multiple canker sores, and the the area underneath my tongue became uncomfortable.  I did not think it was the mouthwash causing the problems so continued use.  Then I started getting dry mouth and the inside of my lip areas top and bottom became very red and very sore.  I stopped using this product and three days later all symptoms were gone, no more canker sores or dry mouth symptoms for over two weeks now.  Stay away from this product and I personally will not be using any kind of mouthwash again.

    In My Opinion, the Best Listerine Mouthwash To Use.
  
",5.0 ,William,"Reviewed in the United States September 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  Initially I brought this due to my dentist recommending me this but also due in part because I ended up getting a welcoming gift from where I got my teeth cleaned and this bottle came with said gift. Albelt, much smaller then the one here. When using this flavor I founded it to be strong at first but overtime I managed to get use to the feeling and the flavor to this as well. To me, I just love the way that the fresh mint flavor feels because it does actually feel like a mouthwash that works and gives you that fresh minty breath whereas the others don't. I have brought this twice but after ended up using the other Listerine MouthWash Cool Mint and I can honestly say that it doesn't like that fresh, strong minty flavor as does the fresh mint one does. So, I would recommend this one.

  I have always used mouthwash, but I always bought the cheapest one, or whatever was on sale and/or had a coupon for.  A few years ago I got a sample of this ""purple listerine"" from my dentist after a cleaning.  The doctor highly recommended the ""purple listerine"" and once I started using it, I never went back to anything else.  While this is more expensive than what I used in the past, the price is worth it because it really cleans my mouth and I have without a doubt noticed a difference.  With proper brushing, flossing and the use of Listerine Total Care I no longer have peridontal disease, I do not bleed when I brush and my mouth feels fresh, clean and healthy after every brush!

  I use these 1-2x each day and it leaves my mouth feeling nice and refreshed. I did end up switching to the other listerine product (the orange one) because I felt that one was more strong. I haven't really had the opportunity to try the generic versions, which can be significantly cheaper than this one, but I would imagine you would get more bang for your buck that way, so I would say value for the money is not as good for this product.

  My Dentist recommended Listerine Total Care Anticavity Fluoride Mouthwash to me. I had been using different mouthwashes that I didn’t realize had no fluoride it them. You can have the benefit of freshening your breath & giving your teeth some love at the same time with this mouthwash :) It has 6 in 1 benefits which are 1.) helps prevent cavities 2.) restores enamel 3.) strengthens teeth 4.) kills bad breath germs 5.) cleans the whole mouth 6.) freshens teeth. True total care! The fresh mint flavor is very nice & fresh. There’s markings on the cap to how much you should pour in. The directions are to swish in your mouth for 1 minute. It is a bit strong so I struggle with the 1 minute piece but I focus on the fact that it’s doing it’s job! It’s best not to eat or drink anything for at least 30 minutes after using. I use after every brush or mid day for a refresher. Using this gives me piece of mind I’m providing my mouth with excellent care. The 1 liter bottle is well worth what I pay & I have this on my subscribe & save list so I save a little more & order with convenience. I definitely recommend!

And it protects your teeth for the future.Just remember that you should use it after you brush, before bed - and don't eat or drink anything afterwards!

    Bought to combat red wine stains
  
",5.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,LindsayRoseEliz,2019年7月27日 在美国审核,"









  
  
    
  I like red wine and fruity candies--so sue me. I dislike how these vices stain my tongue, lips, and teeth, especially since I usually consume them in the evening. Of course, I'm not a college student anymore: I brush and floss my teeth with gusto now that I am on my own dental insurance (a retroactive apology, mom and dad). That alone is rarely enough to make my mouth feel clean after a couple glasses of wine and some delightful starburst candies. I'm too concerned with my oral hygiene and mediocre dental insurance to be able to go to sleep with a mouth tasting of toothpaste mixed in with a hint of merlot. This mouthwash helps to break down the sugars, the stains, and leaves my mouth feeling clean. I also like the mild burn--it makes it feel like it's working while slightly punishing me. Self-flagellation via mouthwash.Even though I haven't had a cavity in 5+ years, I was surprised during my latest dental appointment when both the hygienist and the dentist couldn't stop gushing over the beautiful state of my teeth (honestly, it started to get weird). The only thing that has changed since my last appointment was the fact that I now use an electric toothbrush and this mouthwash. I would bet the toothbrush made the biggest difference, but the mouthwash was probably a helpful addition, too.

It tastes fantastic- minty fresh without being artificially sweet- and it works wonderfully. It burns like Listerine, meeting my expectation of it burning like Listerine.

  Did you know by using this mouthwash each day say × 2. It not only keeps your breath fresh, teeth n gums free of bacteria and your throat. No sore throat while using this. I know their is bacteria that can n does collect in the sides far back in the mouth. Some people have these pockets where the tonsils may be. Bacteria can and does collect in these pockets. With repeated use of listerine those days are over. I thought I had strep. Turns out food we eat can without gargling with a good mouthwash will cause the build up. Despite flossing, water pic , electric tooth brush ect.. these lumps of matter are small scratchy n annoying.  The throat becomes sore. They are white with a tinge of gray and I'm told common. Dentist recommended. If I don't or skip. They form after a week or two of gargling no more lumps . The listerine brings the bacteria out of its hiding place. Freedom! Btw I don't get a cold ever!!

  I used this product, switching from my usual go to, since it was highly rated on Amazon. Little did I know that I was about to embark on a week long journey to hell. The mouthwash caused a massive canker sore on my tongue, my gums, cheeks, and tongue all became incredibly sensitive and swollen, my throat got sore, and I developed a 2-day fever. I was unable to eat anything hard or spicy and even a week later there is some remaining swelling near my back molars. The internet leads me to believe it contains SLS and there are many accounts of this causing similar symptoms. Unbelievable that this is allowed to be sold to consumers without a warning. I’ll never be buying a listerine product again.
