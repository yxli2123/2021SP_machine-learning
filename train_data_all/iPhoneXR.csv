  This phone came in perfect condition! I got my husband a red one and I got myself a yellow one!! We are definitely satisfied 100%!!We upgraded from iPhone 7s and were in LOVE with the cameras! They’re great for taking our product pictures since we work through our phones! There wasn’t a single scratch on either of them!! They arrived within 3 days from purchasing!

  For its price it’s absolutely worth it, due note that the battery’s do not come at 100% mine came at 90 which is totally fine, apart from that there are SUPER minor damage making the devices like new and I will happily be using this for the upcoming years upgrading from a 7. Would recommend!

  Just what I needed for my teenager, she wanted a Newer IPhone 📱 almost 1,000$ which no way in H*! I was going to spend that money...So I looked on Amazon and came across this iPhone XR, read the reviews, thought about it for a little and decided to give it a try, the one part that convinced me was the price and most importantly that the purchase was backed up with Amazon Purchase and Returns so received it yesterday, fully unlocked, no scratches or dents, screen was in perfect shape. Came with the charger and it was just like any brand new purchased phone.I had a previous SIM card, called Metro by TMobile and Transferred alTransferredl the info to the new IPhone and Vuala, i Gad a fully working iPhone for less than 500$ (My goal) and didn’t even needed to go to the store to activate.So, overall on my personal opinion with no benefits or paying me for review, this was a GREAT purchase!

Only thing that was a little scratched up is where the charger goes but it wasn’t like omg this looks horrible. Battery life is at 94%, came with a screen protector, a charger and cube(not apple but worked fine)

    Battery not at 100%
  
",4.0 ,Gordon,"Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  I spent almost a month with this phone and their hasn't been any problems with data, battery, calls, quality, or anything else. I switched from an iphone 6s, which doesn't turn on anymore, and it is amazing not having to charge 2-3 times a day. This battery is fine throughout the whole day with mild to intense use. With mild use and school going on, the battery can last me almost 2 days. I've seen reviews where the battery comes at 100% but mine was not included in those cases. My phone came at 92% and that annoys me a little but it's worth the 100 dollars I save by not buying it from the apple store. I am not sure about waterproofing but my phone came without a scratch or a chip on the aluminum paint. It was like it was new besides for the fact of the battery. I was really happy with it but another annoying thing was that they didn't require a signature with the delivery, my neighbors have stolen airpods that I've ordered before so I was quite annoyed by the fact that they just left it in the mail box without making me personally accept it or sign for it. Beware about that if you live in a shady neighborhood or busy street.

  I was prepared for the worst in transferring both cellular info (with swapping SIM card), and my old phone’s data/content to this new iPhone.Boy was I in for a surprise. My old iPhone 6 (with updated software), was quickly recognized by the new XR, woke it up and started an internal program to run in concert with my new iPhone XR.Through just a few easy to understand prompts, the whole transfer process was finished in about 20 minutes (my old iPhone 6 held a lot of data).I was amazed at the ease, completeness and correctness of the process and had been worried over the transfer and activation process for nothing.This new XR functions flawlessly. The only issue I have with it is that since we now all have to wear masks, the face recognition doesn’t work. Perhaps Apple can correct that by including a software subroutine that will allow the phone’s camera to concentrate on the eyes.But honestly, the phone is awesome!

So hopefully I can get my funds back.Finally received my refund after 19 days. Right after I posted my review. So I'm sure other people have had good experience with them but mine wasn't great. So just be weary on what you order and I'd suggest ordering the insurance as well when spending this kind of money.

I will say if you are under t-mobile and having trouble with the sim, call your care provider first to activate the sim on the phone! you can’t just put it in and go. The phone arrived in a timely manner and i’ve definitely recommended the purchase to others.

  Reading the reviews, I was a little nervous ordering it especially since it was my first time buying my own phone. It came earlier than expected (yay!) and came in pretty good quality. It came with a third party charging block, an apple cord, and the actual phone. The phone did have more cosmetic blemishes than expected including a scratch/crack on the left side of the screen that you can see even from an arm’s length away and very small chips. Considering the price or the phone compared to buying brand new, I’d say that’s pretty reasonable. Other than that, the phone is great! Battery health was at 95% and still lasts the entire day, camera was great, I had no problem putting in my sim card.  Other than the scratch, very satisfied with my purchase.

  Okay, so I'm super skeptical about buying stuff online. I gave it a try and I'm so happy with the results. So here is my back story my daughter dropped my old iPhone 8 plus on the ground and in water so I of course had to get a new phone. I wanted an upgraded iPhone and I came across this iPhone on Amazon and found this iPhone on sale. I read all reviews, and decided to purchase it. I received it not 1 but 2 days earlier then what shipping said I would. I went straight from work to daycare for pickup to Metro PCS, They activated my phone for me, and transferred my current plan. It was so easy and so quick. I'm so happy!!! Also what came in the box, a pamphlet on how to, a charger and not apple but works perfect, and the iPhone and the sim card tray tool thing. Shipping was perfect, delivery was perfect. I want to give you 10 million stars . Thank you so much for anyone that made the process this easy!!!!

  I honestly bought this to replace my iPhone 6.Being candid, I’m to the point of disdain with Apple. They used to be geared towards creatives, and still are. Some of the music apps I use on my iPad and iPhone are, alone, enough to keep me. The machines are superior to the competition. But jacking the cost of their mid-level laptops near $1800 (think new, with 16 gb ram and what do they give you a SSD with not enough memory?Anyway, this phone has a pretty large screen so I can  actually utilize apps like Garage Band (everyone knows that program so I’ll use it for example). There is so much going on in that program, as of the last few years I have just enough room to use it fairly well. This phone is quite heavy. It’s at least twice as heavy as my 6sx.3 gb ram( thought about kicking the dough for the models just a notch up in the ‘X’ family, but the price was a lot higher.I like the red color. I didn’t know it, but I guess it’s an AIDS Awareness special model. I was already aware there was a disease called AIDS, but know I have to keep it in a case so I don’t look like a ‘cause’ person.Bottom line. I have not got into the camera features, but the video when run into my 50”4K knockoff brand, looks fantastic.

  So at first I was a little skeptical about buying this but it’s worth it. Doesn’t glitch and came in perfect condition. Little scratches but not even noticeable but also it’s a refurbished phone so don’t expect perfection! Totally would recommend to others. Also you’re gonna have to get your own headphones which isn’t that bad.

    Be very skeptical...it’s used for a reason!
  
",1.0 ,Andrew Muth,"Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  Update: After a week of use, the phone began to no longer connect to my carrier’s network. Countless hours on support with them and Apple. They are completely dumbfounded. I am never buying used again!When I saw this deal, I was extremely skeptical. Even though it is a used phone, you simply cannot ignore the price tag. It came in a generic box, with a charger and charging cable (not Apple). The one I got has absolutely ZERO scuffs, scratches or wear. There was already a screen protector on it (not sure if from previous owner or from the seller). Very, very pleased!Installation was a breeze. I just had to swap the micro SIM card from my iPhone 8 to the XR and went through Apple's quick setup. Now it's like I've had the phone for years!However, one important thing to note, is that the battery capacity for this is 92% - So it was clearly used for a bit beforehand. That is probably the only gripe. But I really can't complain because of it being used. If you are on the fence about this, I would take the gamble! You will most likely end up just as pleased as I am!Of course, only time will tell on how well worth this purchase was. Odds are if I haven't updated this within a few months of writing everything is still great!So skeptics, I would go for this purchase if you want an upgrade, but don't want to pay full price!

  Great phone. Looks great, functions as expected. Order a CORAL phone for T-MOBILE, received RED for-who knows which carrier, but definitely not T-Mobile. What a disappointment for my 14 y.o. daughter, who worked and saved the money to buy this phone. Very disappointed. Returning it, but is it safe to re-order? Will they get it right on the next go-round?Also, we paid $392 a week ago and now the price is up to $425? Will the seller match the original price?? Will update if I hear anything.

  I purchased two of these. One for my daughter and one for myself. My daughters came first. That one had some minor scratches that weren’t too much noticeable. But phone worked perfect and she loves it. I ordered mine after seeing how good the first went. Mine was in terrific condition with even less scratches than the first. Both phones were super easy to set up. Expecting I’d have some issues with it being unlocked and the phones activating. But both were as easy as putting in the sim and that was that. Only issue I had with mine was that the battery health was already at 87% which I was assuming would at least be over 90%. Not a biggy though. Both phones shipped super fast and I am very pleased with both of them.

  Although the phone arrived dead, once it charged up, it seemed to be running okay. The health of the battery was also 100%!!! As an unlocked phone,  it did not register for my Verizon or Tmobile. It kept indicating phone not allowed for both sim cards. Since I was using it for tmobile and the IMEI was not recognized online, I had to call and the process was completed in 5 minutes and the phone worked instantly.The seller does indicate on the box, not to provide the IMEI number, but in this situation I had to, since it did not work for both carriers, but I did not encounter any problems with the t-mobile representative.

  The product itself was fantastic, coming from a iPhone 6s Plus, everything about this phone and its usage was great. Unfortunately the phone was delivered to me locked and not able to connect to metro pcs, after spending nearly $500 and waiting almost a year for this phone, it doesn’t work... I kept it for a month with the hopes i could find someone to unlock, with no luck, no one could. Decided to finally return it just for it to be stolen i the mail. Before you buy, please take into account that the claim that it’ll be 100% unlocked may not be true in all phones, because of it im out $500, had it been unlocked in the first place like told in the description and had their also been a disclaimer that not all products may be ready to connect or may still be locked, i wouldnt have wasted such hard work, time and money.

  Flawless operation and amazing performance, especially when upgrading from 6s. Used magnifying glass to look for scratches and blemishes and found none. The reported battery health is 100%. It is as good as if purchased directly from Apple but for less. I just popped the SIM card in and run data transfer from the old 6s over BT and it was ready to rock. Just FYI, I did elect 'Amazon Renewed' unit to get extra 1 yr. warranty and better quality (according to the Amazon disclaimers and descriptions). I have absolutely no regrets.

  Honestly, no cap, this is a brand new phone. It didn’t come in the Apple box, but the battery life is at 99% (it was about 35% charged, not that it matters).  No scratches or anything.I’m just a dude from Ohio living in Atlanta, and I’d recommend Amazons refurbished stuff to anyone after doing this purchase.I’m not rich, so I was skeptical, but now I’m glad I upgraded from my 6s to the Coral XR.(I’m not taking pics, cause I’m in bed rn, but trust me. Phone looks and basically is brand new. I just know how I was reading a bunch of reviews and hoping Everything would turn out alright.)All in all, I’m glad. Worst case scenario would’ve been using their return policy and getting another sent to me, so 🙏🏽 I’m grateful that didn’t happen.Choose your color & style, and just take the plunge. It’ll be worth it. Amazon practically guarantees it.

  Their “unlocked” description isn’t accurate. Bought an unlocked phone but it wouldn’t work with Xfinity Mobile. The IMEI wasn’t compatible. Since Xfinity Mobile uses Verizon’s towers I figured I’d try Verizon too. Nope not compatible with them either.  Customer service was prompt and polite, but there warehouse was all out and couldn’t send a replacement, only refund my purchase. Seems suspicious since Amazon still had 4 devices available when I rechecked, but the price had gone up $90.  It’s disappointing since the phone seemed to be in perfect condition and was a great value. Wish they’d honor their descriptions and find a replacement instead just a refund.

  The phone came in a couple of days late but it did snow pretty bad so it's as expected. I just received the phone this morning and so far no complaints. if I didn't know the phone was renewed I would've thought it was brand new. no scratches cracks or anything. I received a charger, a block, a screen protector, and a really nice super protective clear case. the phone charges super fast I was in shock by how fast it was I want to say not even 30 mins and the phone was fully charged. I am, however, stuck trying to update the phone and it's taking some time but it's an update. I will update you soon about how the phones run but so far so good. I will upload pictures too. oh one more thing I would suggest a pop socket because the phones are a good size and with the case, it's definitely harder to use with one hand I think a pop socket would helpUpdate:  the speakers work GREAT very loud. The camera quality... ✨immaculate✨  I don’t know what else to say besides this was a great buy I’m very happy with my purchase and I think you would be too.

  Phone is exactly as I expected it to be. A few blemishes barely noticeable which is what comes with a renewed phone. The battery life is like 93% but I still get about 10 hours before needing a charge. Portrait mode doesn’t work on the front camera & Face ID doesn’t work at all. But it’s an upgrade from my 6s & I have no regrets. The quality & the price match of you ask me. I still feel like I got a steal.

  So my wife was in the market for a new iPhone, upgrading from her iPhone 6, which was now obsolete according to several required apps she uses for work. I couldn't bring myself to pay Apple 800 dollars or more for a new basic phone. I tried to get my wife to agree to an Android and that wasn't going to happen. Then I found these Amazon Renewed phones. I wound up saving about 175 dollars on an almost new iPhone Xr.The phone was delivered when it said it would be delivered and does appear as new as possible, less the original packaging and equipment. The box was a repackage box, the power adapter was an unknown USB wall charger and the cable was a lightning cable although it had a crack in the lightning plug housing so it will last about a week.The migration from old phone to new phone took about an hour, with an iOS upgrade in for good measure (this phone came with 12.2 and 12.4 has been out for only a few weeks so it is close to current).Overall, happy about the phone. Time will tell if I run into issues with it lasting but so far all is good.

  I have had this for a couple months now and I have absolutely no complaints. The battery came at 100% functionality and it looked brand new. I definitely recommend a screen protector especially if you drop your phone frequently. I am on my second screen protector. I don’t have a protective case and again, I drop my phone a lot but the back hasn’t cracked at all. I say get whatever case you want and get some good quality screen protectors and you should be set.

  Like others, I was a bit hesitant to purchase because of some reviews however, I received my phone yesterday and not only did it come in the original box, it came with a brand new Apple charger AND headphones. It says in the description that headphones are not included so this was a nice surprise. But wait! It gets better! This phone is STILL under warranty until this coming December!! The battery life is 100%, the screen and body are in mint condition, and all internal workings seem to be in working order. Very excited! Would recommend

  Got a red renewed 128gb XR, ""CPOCell""  was the seller I got it from. Phone is in perfect condition, an amazing upgrade from my 4+ year old iPhone 6s. The battery life was at 100% which I was VERY pleased with because in the description it said batteries could work at 80% capacity on arrival. I will totally consider buying the amazon renewed iPhones again in the future when I need my next upgrade, can't tell a difference from a brand new iPhone from the Apple store compared to this refurbished one. The ones from there with the same storage run you $650 and mine with tax came to just under $500. I saved about $200 on this which is definitely worth it to me.Note: It comes with a stock charger (not apple) which I don't mind because it works fine and no included headphones, but that was stated in the product description so it's a non issue.I will update the review if there are any issues!

  I got the fully unlocked blue iPhone XR. It is in pristine condition. This is my first ""renewed"" pone but I would definitely go for it again. It comes with all accesories in like new condition and it is in fact fully unlocked. I travel a lot for work and have used it all over the world with different providers with no problema whatsoever. It DOES NOT come in a Factory box so just be aware. It comes in a similar box labeled Amazon renewed so think about it if this is important to you. In my case, I gave it a shot and I am truly impressed. Look no further.

  It took only a few weeks for the phone to mess up and I took care of this phone like it was my child. The phone would glitch out here and there and then shut off randomly after being fully charged and ever now and then when my phone is charging at night I will wake up while it’s on the charger and it’s completely shut down. The phone it’s worth what I expected tho everything else is in good condition just expected more from a billion dollar company. And would like a refund just enough to fix the port even half idc, because I got my carrier on the phone and all my personal info and everything and don’t want to send it back. I have been proud with most of the things I have gotten from Amazon and even the phone but using it in time disappointed me and I’m slowly losing my trust about buying things from them

  This phone arrived in like new condition with all accessories included. Set up and transfer from my older IPhone went quickly. I put in the SIMM card from my old phone and was up and running. My phone slipped and dropped on my kitchen floor. It looked like it chipped the corner of the screen. I found out later, it was just the screen protector that was damaged, the phone was ok. Some 2 piece cases may not fit properly because of the thickness of the screen protector. Not a big deal.

    Glitchy and shuts down. I really wanted to like it though;(
  
",1.0 ,Grace Nako,"Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  When I first got this phone, I wanted to like it SO bad. At first it was fine, but every time I dropped it (even 1 ft drop onto carpet), it would shut down and was unresponsive. I have to manually restart it every time it falls and sometimes just when I'm holding it or when it's in my back pocket. Everything else about this phone is great, but this happens so often during the day I just can't ignore it. I dropped it earlier and it cracked (I'm sad) and ever since, the regular touch screen goes through unresponsive phases. Also, 5 mins ago, it totally glitched out with static on the screen and now won't restart at all. I am sad to say I want to send it back and hopefully I'll get another one that works better. I just want my data back though..

  These renewed phones are a bit of a gamble. You either get a perfect one, or you get a defective one. This is the last time I’ll be ordering any renewed phone. I received it and it was packed well, looked good all up until I made a phone call and realized the top speaker didn’t work. Tried a few workarounds to no avail. Returned within 15 minutes of opening it. All I can say is good luck, it’s a risk and I hope you get a good one. 🤷🏼

  I ordered this phone when mine broke, and didn't read any reviews (which was a dumb move on my part of course). I read the reviews two days later and was getting very nervous about how it was going to be. I trusted amazon renewed, and I must say, I wasn't disappointed. My phone didn't have a scratch on it at all whatsoever, and works completely fine. The only problem or concern I have is that the battery is at 88%. But that's what you can expect from a refurbished phone, mine is from the seller: ""Electronic Deals.""

I honestly don’t really understand exactly what the problem is because it will let me download any other app, it’s alright though I guess I can just watch YouTube off of safari, but yeah basically that was the one and only problem I found with the product other than that it’s great!

  Just wanted to share my experience buy the used iPhone XR off of amazon. As for the body and screen of the phone, the screen and back are absolutely fantastic and the only noticeable damage is two tiny nicks on the aluminum side which I have to look really hard to see. The battery health is at 96%. So I’m really happy, I did read some mixed reviews but I’m sure it depends on the seller you get it from. It did come with an off brand charger and no headphones but it did come with a decent clear case with no brand which is nice because I didn’t order a case I wanted to go in a store or try out a few first and this will keep it safe until then. The seller was chubbiestech as well so just wanted to let you guys know that. Super happy.

  Everything turned out alright it was like new you only get the phone and charger so I wouldn’t recommend this is if you want the apple experience with original box and everything but if you don’t care about all that then save some money and buy this but also think about the is purchase because it is still a lot of money

    Best phone I've bought from Amazon

  The phone came quickly. It was packaged securely and came with a screen protector, block, and charging cable. All the buttons work and the battery life is great. The phone looks basically new except for a couple of scratches by the charging port (which are barely visible). The camera does not make the clicking noise! I will say buying a phone on Amazon is kinda hit or miss but I personally had a great experience.

  I bought this because I needed a new phone and the XR was perfect! MobileSpree was a good seller because the device looked brand new with no scratches on either side of the phone. However one thing I noticed was that the phone was full of gunk around the edges and both speakers, but I just cleaned it off with sanitized wipes and rubbing alcohol with q-tips for the speakers. The battery health was at 92% which was better than what I expected but I expected at least 100% since I’ve had other phones arrive with a new battery.

  I love this phone! This is a return to the iPhone world for me from a five year absence. So I’m happy with the iPhone XR as my device of choice. The battery life is great! The color is so beautiful! The touchscreen is great. The durability of the screen is above excellent. I dropped it by accident and it landed face down and didn’t even crack. And it fell pretty hard on a vinyl floor tile so that speaks to its durability. Can’t say enough about this phone.

  I was very skeptical and was worried after ordering it. Based on some of the reviews it seemed like some people had bad experiences but most of the bad reviews were just nit picking about small details that personally weren’t an issue to me. The phone does come in a generic box as well as with a generic charger and a sim card tool. If you’re willing to look past this then the phone is truly great! For an affordable price my phone is in near perfect condition, battery life is 98% and I had absolutely no issues setting it up with my carrier (MetroPCS). I definitely don’t regret my decision and for less than $500, I can’t complain!

  After owning this phone for 8 months(paid $500 for it) it is basically a paperweight now. It was fine from April 2020 up until December 2020 then it said it needed a cellular update, every time I tried to do that update it wouldn’t work, only allowing the phone to work on WiFi. After being frustrated with this for over a month I decided to update via iTunes, this did not work either so I made an appointment with Apple. When I took it to them they said the phone was not repairable. They couldn’t even look up the serial number, it was like it didn’t exist.I’d stay far away, unless you only need a phone for less than 8months

  The appearance of the phone was really good. But it was not operational. Even the box it came in said it had network connection problems. So why would you sell a phone that can not be used on any network, and for $450. Makes no sense to me and it makes no sense how Amazon hasnt shut down your operation. You take people's money knowing your products aren't any good and then we have to wait for ever to get our hard earned money returned to us.

  I must say this was my first time buying a refurbished phone and I was skeptical about it but I read reviews and many said they got nearly mint condition phones. So I bought it and they sent me a phone with plenty of scratches on the screen. I found that unacceptable and I contacted the seller. I returned that phone and they sent me a phone that’s immaculate. I mean it might as well be brand new and the battery is PERFECT. I don’t have to charge this battery more than once a day with moderate use. This is my first iPhone as well and although there are some features I wish they had that were more like Android I can now understand the iPhone fanboys. The seller was so accommodating and I feel like I got a brand new phone for much cheaper than regular price. I wish I could give 4.5 instead of 4 stars and the only reason why I would deduct a half star is because they gave me a bad charger. Because of that I can’t give a 5 star review. Sorry. But I used my Samsung fast charger with the iPhone cord and it charges fast now. Other than that I highly recommend this seller.

The front camera though won’t work and I have to reset the phone but that’s about it. Everything else works great and I had 98% battery health which is amazing. This was well worth the money vs buying a new XREdit 23 Nov 2020The camera issue has been resolved since this was posted. It seemed to resolve on its own after about a month of using the phone.

  Overall, the IPhone was in pretty good shape, but the screen had some defects, for example, the top piece has lots of light scratches on it, at first you don’t really notice them, but if you look closely, you’ll see all these scratches from who-knows-what at the top. Secondly, there is a small white transparent dot on the middle left portion of the screen, like if some sort of heavy pressure was put on the screen itself. Doesn’t really bother me that much, but from time to time my eyes would catch a glimpse of the dot. Other than that though, the phone itself runs really smooth, has a great battery life, I could use it almost a whole 24 hours without charging it, and it only takes 35-45 minutes to fully charge. Overall, though the screen is not in perfect shape, the phone is extremely useful, smooth, convenient, and long-lasting.

    Speaker Issue
  
",3.0 ,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  The phone looked great!  A couple of surface scratches on the top right of the screen, but that's to be expected I guess with a used phone.  I wasn't really concerned with those small issues. I transferred everything from my old phone and completely set up the new phone and everything was great!  I was soooo excited and felt really great about my purchase,.....until I made a call.  It wasn't until I had invested several hours into the new phone that I realized the ear speaker has a shattery sound and makes it difficult to hear the other person on the call.  The speaker does technically work, but the voice sounds muffled and shattered, like an old busted car speaker.  I really hate it because I like the phone and spent so much time setting everything up to be personalized to me.  If I new the quality of the speaker before hand, I would have returned it immediately, but at this point I think I will just deal with it.  I don't like change and it took me forever to upgrade from an Iphone 5S (crystal clear speaker btw) to the XR, and unfortunately it was just a bad experience because of the speaker issue.  The phone is excellent other than this one issue, but a key feature of the a phone is to have conversations with others right?  I needed this phone for my personal and business use, so I hope the speaker doesn't continue to degrade.I'm not sure how the company tests for sound quality and clarity, but I would encourage everyone if you decide to purchase a used phone, call someone on the phone first before personalizing it to you.

  I got this phone to hopefully be just as good as new, but no. It has times when it drops calls for no reason, exits from an app unexpectedly, will not allow for volume adjustment, and sometimes will not allow me to answer an incoming call. I didn't care that the air pods were not included (I knew from the product description and I already had some). I expected a scratch or two on the back glass (I use an Otter Box for drop protection anyway) so no big deal there either. I love the big screen and the high-quality camera. It would have been perfect if the annoying little quirks did not happen so frequently.

  This product did not work charger did not fit, and that’s not even the worst of it. When tried to switch services from my old IPhone the boost mobile technician checked and this phone still had an active sprint account so I could not activate the phone. And to make matters worse they charge a 100 dollar restock fee hilarious what is amazon doing I love amazon but This will change things......BUYERS do not make purchases from third party sellers.

I worked with my phone service provider to check out sim card(s) not there- No help available.  I may have been unlucky but glad Amazon returned product.

No difference, except for the generic charger and cable, but that was expected. Seller merits the positive reviews.Update:  I finally set up the phone.  Everything seems to work fine, but the speaker seems to be damaged.  Contacted the seller directly.  Will wait to see the the response.  Staying optimistic since the vendor got great ratings.Update: Seller is great and the replacement phone is working like a new phone.

  Writing the review on this phone now. Normally I don’t like to purchase refurbished items as it can be pretty risky, but so far I’ve gotten the iPhone from this seller and a laptop from another seller both in untouched condition. I’d trust refurbished items on here at least since there’s also a return policy.

  The iPhone was great. It came with a clear case and a screen protector and a charger(not from apple) but no headphones sadly. The battery capacity was 90% which is good in my opinion. The Face ID works like a charm, no scratches on the screen, back glass, camera, or the aluminum frame. This might be risky but with a seller like chubbiestech, they don’t disappoint. At this price point, this is a great buy this year.

  I was so hesitant to buy a used phone on amazon.  I’ve always purchased brand new from Apple because I’m so picky about the quality of items.  I decided to take a gamble on this and I’m so glad I did.  The phone is exactly as described, works perfectly and the condition is a solid 9.5 out of 10. The phone I received had very minor marks on the back (which I expected given this is used and the fact Apple uses glass backs now) but they’re barely noticeable even by my picky standards.  The screen is flawless and I’m beyond impressed with this purchase and seller.  The battery health on the phone I received is 96% which way higher than I was expecting it to be

Checked everything from: camera, microphone, speakers, flash, battery life, etc. everything was brand new. Don’t get scared of the other reviews that look bad. I too was scared but I am extremely satisfied. If I ever need to buy a phone off Amazon Renewed again in the future, I won’t be worried.

  I ordered this phone as an upgrade from my 6s which was outdated and slow. Amazon guaranteed that the new phone that’s I ordered would be just like new. That was definitly not the case. When I red or Ed the package the back glass was scratched all up. Later when I transferred SIM cards my Verizon account was frozen because the phone was labeled as stolen. Also the phone is supposed to be water resistant and could be submerged but I took it camping and went into the showers with it. After the shower it strobed black and white but when soaked In rice it was fixed. All in all it’s safe to say that I will return this and get a refund.

It’s battery life goes head-to-head with that of the 11. And this song came out before the 11th so I definitely told you something. I will recommend this phone for anyone.

  I’d rate this phone 3.5 stars. Overall, I cannot complain.  It functions properly. Battery life is at 99%. There are mild scratches on the side and back of the phone (more than what I have on my iPhone 7, but I’m particular with my stuff). It came with a generic charger and was in a standard box, not an apple one. There is mild-moderate dirt/lint in the cracks/crevices/speaker cover. It came with a screen protector installed, which was unfortunately installed a little off-center. It does not appear this phone was disassembled and fully refurbished. It appears to be a used phone. Would I buy another one?  I’m not sure. I’d highly consider buying a brand new one from Apple for $180 more, that way you know exactly what you’re getting.  However, if you just need a phone and are ok with minor cosmetic blemishes, this could be a way to save a little money over a new phone.

  When a phone is lost/stolen and reported to the carrier it was registered with, the carrier blacklists the phone's IMEI so it can't be used with cellphone data. The phone shipped to me was unusable with any carrier due to it having a blacklisted IMEI. I'm extremely disappointed in this purchase.

  Phone came in acceptable conditions. Scratches on the side. All aspects of the phone work except for FaceTime and IMessage. I went into an Apple store and was directed to call a technician, called 3 over the phone who told me the same thing to restart my phone and would not call back after I restarted my phone. The last one I make sure I skip that trouble shoot solver and move on, he said there was a problem (probably) with my carrier. Went over to my carrier and had someone tinker with setting on my phone to no avail but in her defense she is not Apple technician. She confirmed that my plan is what it is and that there shouldn’t be any problems. I then call amazon who then after describing my problem calls iPhone and put me back through that process over the phone where I did not get a call back again. I messaged amazon and this guy Mark seems To be the most helpful and recommended I try to replace the phone. Might return all together and get rid of this headache

  I know that 89% battery capacity isn't that bad, I just wish they actually replaced the battery to get a brand new one. The phone came will a screen protector on it that was well-applied, so that was nice. Everything works prefectly and it was easy to set up, I just had to slide my AT&T chip in it and login to my Apple ID and I was good to go. I would definitely recommend buying refurbished, it's not worth the money for a brand new phone! And I can always replace the battery later for $50 if I need too, although it has been fine so far.

  One of the iphones is perfect, just like new in appearance and performance; the second one had a small paint  blemish around the lens but camera performed great; the important problem was: on the incoming calls the person who called me hears interference; not in my phone side but only on the caller side. I called my phone company provider but told me my line was good. Then I changed the SIM card chip to my old phone and there is absolutely no interference on the incoming callers. Finally i decided to return this phone. Wished there was an exchange option and not only a return option.The iphone I am keeping is working perfectly was easy to start and even came with a nice case and a glass screen protector.

  I’ll admit after reading through the reviews I was VERY hesitant but I am BEYOND happy with my purchase.The phone is FLAWLESS. Yes you read that right, absolutely flawless. It came with a glass screen protector already installed and all OEM accessories. Phone has a BRAND NEW 100% capacity battery and is still under factory warranty until May 2020. I understand some of this will vary but this is a review of my experience.I purchased another “renewed” phone, Pixel 2XL, from a different seller and it’s perfectly functional but no where near the condition this iPhone XR arrived in.I just popped my SIM card in and it worked right away. Usually with my carrier I have to call in with the imei number but I didn’t have to. I also tried a GSM SIM card and it worked too, fully unlocked as advertised.Best. Used. Phone. Purchase.

  Phone came with a blown main speaker and the back and screen were heavily scratched. I’m not going to outright trash the seller as I’m waiting to see how they reconcile this issue and I’m going to return with a proper review once I receive my replacement device and or a possible refund if necessary. Right now it seems like they never even tested the phone and they didn’t look at the device because of the scratches mentioned.

    A lot of scratches and scuffs
  
",3.0 ,Henry,"Reviewed in the United States June 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  Saw the good reviews on this, but when i got it, there were a lot of scuffs and scratches, especially on the bottom right corner as well as on the side of the camera lens in the back. I'd usually be okay with it since i have my case to cover the 4 sides of the phone, but this is a tell-tale sign that the previous owner just didn't take care of this phone and that's an indicator that this phone probably won't last.  I'm coming from the IPhone 6s (which I had for like 5 years) and plan to stay with the XR for years before upgrading.  Battery life was at 91% which wasn't too bad. I'd say it's more like a gamble what you get, so good luck guys. Planning to buy another one with a Grade A or Grade B+ so it 100% won't have this much cosmetic issues. This phone I got was at best a Grade B.

Everything else looks and works great so far. Reasonable price. I was really afraid to order renewed iPhone, but in my opinion iPhone that i got worth money that i spent.

  I did my due diligence and researched several options before I committed to a renewed IPhone XR from the Amazon. I had high hopes and really needed an unlocked new(er) phone. And you would think with so many positive reviews, this was the real deal. WRONG!!! The phone arrived nicely packaged with a slight scratch on the side. Not a big deal at all, because separately I purchased a nice case for it. The screen was also nice with no visible scratches. I’m addition, I attached a screen protector. So the phone performed flawlessly for about two months. I loved how responsive it was. And then out of the blue, I receive the following settings message: “Unable to verify this iPhone has a genuine Apple battery. Health information not available for this battery.” SAY WHAT? The phone started automatically shutting off and restarting. You’re in the middle of writing an email, and boom the phone shuts off. Lovely. The battery indicator said it’s completely drained, but it really isn’t. Waste of time. Highly disappointed and will send it back tomorrow for a refund.

  I love my new phone. I am going from an iPhone rosegold 6S to a white XR.  It's a pretty big jump.  I have only had it for 5 days but it works great. No scratches or marks on the phone.  The maximum battery is 93% which is fine (I new it be at least 80%)  There is nothing I dislike at this time.  I bought my 6S (had it for 2.5 years) on Amazon and had such a good experience I got the XR on Amazon.  It is a much more affordable way to buy a phone.

Yes you get a after market power cord and charger, but it tells you this in the description. So if you didn’t notice it, it’s on you not them.

  I ordered this coral iPhone  xr for my mother and I was so excited when I got the phone because it looks like brand new. My mother noticed that one part of the screen is dead and honestly I didn’t believe her until I try to type something on the keyboard and I noticed the backspace button doesn’t work. I tried to open another app to see if it was a software glitch but it’s not. I’m assuming it has to do with the screen. I’m going to return this phone and see if i can get another one because the quality is great is just that part of the screen that doesn’t work properly.

Im not going to lie i was a bit nervous because of the horrible review section. However the speakers work perfectly. The screen is bright and vibrant! Im very satisfied with this purchase.

  For starters: it depends on what seller you go through when ordering these phones. I bought mine through Digital Age USA and the phone is perfect! It said it was supposed to arrive February 2nd but it arrived January 19th. I’m sure it’s because I live only a few hours away from where it was shipping from. It did come with a charger box that wasn’t Apple but if you actually read the description it says that could happen and that it won’t come with headphones. Completely understandable considering these are used phones. Other than a TINY scratch on the outside of the back camera, the phone is flawless with no severe scratches. I’ve had the phone for 2 days now and I haven’t run into any issues. The touch screen works perfectly and I was able to turn it on through Total Wireless (which goes through Verizon).My advice for anyone wanting to get a renewed phone: LOOK AT THE SELLER! The seller I bought this from has a 90% rating. The very next day a different seller was on here with only a 70% rating. If the seller doesn’t have a good rating DO NOT BUY FROM THEM!! Wait until another seller comes up with decent reviews.

  If I could give this a rating of a zero,  I would because that's how bad it is.  I had an older iPhone 6 and it works way better than this.  I updated to this phone because I bought the Apple series 5 watch and it required a newer IPhone to work with it.  This XR phone keeps dropping calls.  Many times I'm not able to dial out.  What's the point of having a phone if your calls keep dropping?  2nd major issue is when I'm away from my house,  I'm not able to use my data.  Hence,  I'm not able to connect.  Even when I'm home and use wifi data,  I would lose connection.  I would be on Facetime with my mom and so often,  I would lose connection.  3rd, the battery gets hot very fast.  Again,  I never had any of these issues with my iPhone 6.  I wanted to return the phone,  but I was told I was a month to late.  I only had the phone for 4 months.

    Screen had rainbow type ""blister"" when screen is viewing blacks
  
",2.0 ,Thomas,"Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2020","









  
  
    
  It was a refurb phone, but I've dealt with factory refurbs in the past and have had no issue. Not a big complainer on my end, but lets face it- phones are expensive nowadays and one deserves to see their money well spent. The phone was in typical refub condition, a few small scratches on the rim of the frame (find, no complaints here), BUT when I powered on the phone and saw the apple (the rest of the screen is black) I knew something was off. There was this small ""rainbow-esque"" circle just to the right of the Apple logo which told me right away that the screen was replaced and not done properly. Sending it back and maybe thinking about giving them another chance.  Other than the screen issue, the phone came as described. Could have done a little better job insulating the phone in general, it was literally in factory ziplock bag and inside a box- so it was able to move around a lot. Hope this helps.

  Disappointed as I ordered unlocked and it clearly stated it would work with any carrier of choice (e.g. AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, US-Cellular, Cricket, Metro, etc.).When we tried to put the SIM it would not fit in the slot . Checked the video on the SIM card tray holder slot size for Iphone XR and Iphone X and is the same and the SIM also is shaped the same. After looking at the slot more carefully we noticed that the slot shape is not cut to fit the SIM. I guess AMAZON certified is not doing a good job at testing and making sure the slot that holds the SIM is actually compatible.

  I bought an iPhone XR fully unlocked, at first I thought that the phone was not unlocked I took it to my carrier and they told me that it was still locked, I was so mad but then I took it to my carrier again but different store an they told me that it was good to go, and I was are you serious I couldn't believe it. What happened was that the guy from the first store was in training 🤪.I love the iPhone XR its it's really good .

  Some background: I have had the phone for one week. My previous phone was an iPhone SE, so this was a huge upgrade. I am a masters student balling on a budget. I typically keep a phone for 3 to 4 years (until it completely stops working) so I was looking for a bargain without substituting quality.Better than I ever could have hoped! The iPhone XR arrived a day early (even in a time of pandemic) in a generic box with a generic charging cord. I put in my SIM card and set up the phone in less than an hour- no issues. I checked the battery health and it is at 97% capacity. I expect like with most iPhones that the battery lifespan will be about 2-3 years before I must replace it. I am very happy with this! No broken buttons, screen damage or anything! For over $150 in savings compared to a new device, I am blown away by the quality. I will never buy a new phone again- I will use BuySPRY refurbished phones.

  This unit worked great for a few weeks until it began to give SIM card issues - eventually led to failure. I ended up with a phone that no longer held a cellular signal, eventually every day it dropped the cellular service going from bars to no service within a min even - stuck in a cycle - even after paying for a new SIM card - later found out that the phone was the issue and returned it. Pretty disappointed. Don’t think i would but from here again. Unless they offered an exchange of the device for me but no one has offered.

  PLEASE DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE. They say that the phone is unlocked but it is NOT and the only way to get it unlocked is to go to the original carrier, however it is impossible to find out who the carrier was. I bought 3 different SIM cards none of them worked. Talked to so many different carriers to resolve the issue and nothing was resolved. I sent the phone back, got my refund, and purchase a phone directly from Apple. I wish I could get all my time and energy back I used to try and get this phone to work. Disappointed.

  As of right now very satisfied with this phone. It came with a charging cable and block, but the phone is working great. I was SUPER skeptical at first. Seeing all the negative reviews, about stolen phones and locked phones. But those really negative reviews were a couple years old, so I kept a positive outlook. The phone is quick and much better than my iPhone 7 which served me very well for its time and age, and overall this phone is in mint condition. It has a couple of surface scratches on the screen but nothing major. As for its battery life I was kinda disappointed with it being barely at 89% but other than that a great phone. Approved by me. Hope this sits well with anyone attempting to pull the trigger on this phone.

  I have been using Apple products for as long as apples been a thing. I saw this product on multiple commercials and after doing my own research on it I decided to buy it. Some of the best features of this product are its long battery life, user-friendly interface, and low price. The iPhone Xr has the longest battery life out of all the iPhones in its generation and it lasts me the whole day without any problems. Its user interface is also very easy to navigate which makes things very convenient. The best part about this phone is its price starting at $600, compared to other iPhones that cost $1000 and above. There are some negatives to this phone, however. The camera, screen resolution and it is not durable without a case. The camera on this phone is subpar compared to other iPhones in this generation which is to be expected at its given price point. The screen is also subpar to the other iPhones as it can only go up to 1080p resolution compared to 4k. The glass on the back of the phone leaves much to be desired as it can easily shatter without protection from a case. Overall, this phone does have its drawbacks, but it is still a great buy.

  Boo yah! My phone came in mint condition with an Apple charger.Something people need to know about newer iPhones is the materials have changed. Opposed to older models that were more scratch resistant but more prone to shattering when dropped, the newer models traded in the scratch resistance factor for higher durability and less likelihood of shattering occurring. There’s a coating on it and yes, you will ABSOLUTELY need not only a proper case for this phone, but also a screen protector. I did not know this until after purchasing this phone and noticed some minor cosmetic scratches from my light usage.My unsolicited advice if buying is to also purchase a case and screen protector simultaneously so you don’t have to deal with scratching. Both can be found on Amazon together for under $20 total.Unless you’re totally rich and don’t care. Then do whatever you want because this is probably your back up back up iPhone.

  The phone works like new. The battery life was at 91%, which isn’t bad but it means I’ll have to get another battery put in sooner than normal. The switch on the side of the phone that silences the phone is broken still. It’s stuck on silent which I will have to fix soon. Other than that everything is great.

The only problem that I have with the phone I received, is that it arrived with a bunch of little scratches on the screen. They can’t be seen when the phone is on, but when the screen is off and black, and the light shines on it, you see all the little scratches on the actual screen. I wish that they would have given the phone a new screen before sending it, but the over all function of the device is good.

  I was leery of ordering a phone online but I am very pleased.  The phone looks brand new, no scratches whatsoever and the battery seems to be great!  It didn’t come with an Apple charger but for the price and the condition, I don’t care!  Overall, very pleased.  I had an IPhone 6 which I loved but the camera was horrible and I am more than pleased with the camera on this phone!  I was on the fence but trust me, this phone was worth every penny I paid!

  The iPhone came earlier than the expected delivery date. It looks perfect in condition, no damages, scratches, dent, or anything. I’m satisfied. I was skeptical because of some of the 1 star reviews but as a seller myself I’ve learned that petty people over exaggerate irrelevant factors to hurt a seller’s reputation. So, I’d highly recommend someone to purchase this, plus amazon is amazing with customer service and returns. It’s also a very good price.

  Received my device moments ago and this is what I find. Boy am I pissed. I spent $450 bucks on what feels like trash. Of course it’s used but I do expect something Amazon endorsed to be thoroughly checked, cleaned, polished/ buffed out, and certified. After all isn’t that the name of the sub-store where we’re purchasing from “Renewed Certified & carrier unlocked”..... other customer have seemingly lucked out but who wants to shop anywhere where your depending on the luck of the draw inorder to secure a descent purchase. Contacted the seller but at this point I couldn’t be more disappointed used phone or not.Update: Spoke to customer service. They suggest I purchase an additional phone which they’ll be sure to inspect to ensure there is no damage. I’m then to resend the damages until back and they’ll refund that. So they screwed me for $450 bucks And I’m just supposed to dump another $450 into these already untrustworthy people. What great customer service. Take your business somewhere else. DO NO BUY FROM THESE PEOPLE. YOU’ve BEEN WARNED.

  I was thrilled when I received this and quickly got it setup and started using it. It took me a few days to figure out that the microphone did not work. On calls, or recording a voice memo, the only thing getting through was white noise. I hope the vendor improves the quality assurance testing on their renewed devices. This phone was great otherwise, very good cosmetically, but I needed it to function as a basic phone too. Response to email regarding the issue took almost 4 business days which was disappointing but they did send a prepaid return label and are promising a full refund (we'll see how that goes).

    iPhone XR legit review!

  this product that I receive is amazing! I am so happy that I have got this phone because I've worked for this phone for quite some time now and for the fact that I actually got it, it's great! This phone has absolutely no scratches no dent marks it came with a charger but no headphones sadly. But it's OK though because I already have some headphones. The battery life was kind of low, but I get why it was low though. I don't know why I see all kinds of replies about this product being bad but it really isn't though. It take time for it to arrive but it is worth the wait!

    Phone was not unlocked

  Upon receiving my order for an “unlocked” iPhone XR, I then renewed my cellular data with Simple Mobile and placed my current SIM card into my new, unlocked device. However, the new, unlocked device wouldn’t pick up the cellular data that I JUST payed for and renewed and insisted I had “no service.” After phone calls and store visits to my cell phone carrier, Simple Mobile, I was forced to purchase a new SIM card for $20.00, and transfer my cellular service onto the new card, but the service still didn’t work on the device! 20.00 down the drain! At Simple Mobile, the representative tried putting in a friends AT&T sim card into my new device to test if their service would work, which IT DID. After waiting about an hour in Simple Mobile for them to trouble shoot and call IT, the representative confirmed that my purchase of an Unlocked IPhone XR turned out to be a LOCKED phone after all!

  The seller used false advertising and straight up lies. Spent $350 on a useless piece of crap. The phone is not fully unlocked like it was advertised as and is still locked to a phone company. Again do not buy these items they are falsely advertised and the seller is only concerned about getting your money.

  My phone works great and I had no issues setting it up on cricket. It has no visible damage externally, but there is a small magenta line in the bottom left hand corner of the screen, only visible when the phone is turned on and displaying a darker color in that area. Definitely not a big deal, does not effect phone function, but slightly distracting until you get used to it.Overall, would definitely recommend this product as a cost-effective way to get a newer iPhone!

  The phone was great for the first 30 days until I tried the water resistant features. The phone should be able to go underwater for thirty minutes. I only had the phone underwater for about 30 seconds before taking it out. The phone worked fine until the next morning when lines started to appear on screen. It glitches out and I had to remove the SIM card and return it. I’m buying for the apple website now and never from this company again. I do not think the water is what caused the damage because the phone worked fine for many hours before glitching

    Great Purchase So Far Despite a Couple of Minor Issues
  
",4.0 ,JimBob-JK47,"Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is my first phone purchase in almost a decade. I am going from an iPhone 5s to an iPhone XR.I asked someone for advice for where to purchase my next iPhone. I have a lack of trust when it comes to purchasing phones on the internet after hearing about so many stories of people being scammed. I was told by a couple of people that amazon has registered users so I gave it a try.So far I am happy with my purchase. The iPhone is in like new condition with no major scratches. However, there are two little scratch indentations on the front screen. They are hardly noticeable because they are to the side of the front just off the LCD screen and screen protector and do not interfere with the use of the phone.When it comes to the actual phone itself, the big screen, sound quality, and fast processor are something to smile about. Apple outdid themselves with this phone. The only thing that will take some getting use to is the big slim design. I find it hard to reach some parts of the screen while holding the phone in one hand. I think there is an adjustment period. The phone was incredibly easy to set-up. I just had to back my old iPhone up to iTunes and then restore that backup on the XR.I do not like how there is no headphone jack and that the phone only has 64g storage but this can be overlooked. (I know that I also have the option of purchasing a different model that has better storage and a headphone jack I just thought it is worth mentioning for anyone considering to buy this item.)Pros-Great price. Fast shipping time. Sold from someone trustworthy. Honest listing and as described. Came with screen protector and SIM removal tool. The phone indicates that the battery life is at 95%.As a phone, great quality overall. The LCD screen is big and bright. The sound is fantastic. The processor is super fast (I think one of the fastest processors you can purchase in a smartphone).Cons-The phone came with a knockoff charger not an OEM (original) Apple charger or headphones. Yes, using an Apple charger versus using a knock off makes a difference, look into it if you do not believe me. Fortunately I have my old Apple chargers. The screen has a couple miner indented scratches. My finger covers the mic at the bottom of the phone sometimes when I record videos. The audio gets blocked or becomes scratchy.I made this review as detailed as possible because I greatly benefited from other reviews made by other people that purchased this phone.One major takeaway from all of the comments on this listing is to be careful that you may or may not get a phone that has some sort of issue. I think this comes with the territory when it comes to purchasing a renewed phone. When you are spending a lot of money on a phone you expect quality and consistency. For a couple of hundred dollars more I could have bought straight from Apple, but I am happy I got to save that money.

  I was a little worried ordering this with everything that’s been going ok and I didn’t want to get scammed but I always check the reviews on things and I seen more good reviews than bad reviews so I just decided to get it a shot and order this phone my husband were trying to pay for the phone with our carrier but it’s was just a headache because only certain stores had them so we just bought it. I’m glad we did because it’s just like brand new no scratch or anything my husband was able to plug his SIM card right up and it’s started working instantly. Get it you won’t regret it I love this phone .

  I was going back and forth on whether to get the iPhone 11 or the X. I found the Xr and read reviews and most people are satisfied with their Xr. I’m glad I found this refurbished one on here. So far, the phone has worked well. I haven’t had any issues . The camera is magnificent. I am using this phone with Straight Talk, and it took about 8 hours to port over from Verizon. Unless I missed it in the description, I wasn’t aware of who the original carrier of the phone was, so that threw me off because I was trying to get the porting started and it kept tell me the phone was not compatible. Turns out you have to know what carrier the phone is on in order to have the correct porting. Other than that, I am satisfied with my purchase. You can’t beat the price.

  I was so excited to get the phone for my daughter it came and it looked great the battery life was great everything went well until we went to charge it we tried Apple cords we tried the cord it came with we tried about 10 different cords and it will not charge the only way will charge is if it sits on a charging pad so clearly the port needs to be replaced so they sent me a phone that won’t even charge by the port so they must not inspect these as well as they say they do hoping the seller contact me so I can get a different one because it not convenient to have a phone the only charges by charging pad. Stinks I got the phone all set up a screen protector on it and i need a different one I was nervous to buy a used phone off of Amazon

  Got a little freaked out by some horror stories in these reviews so I figured I’d throw in my two cents. This phone is great! No scratches, battery at 99% capacity, everything runs smooth, came fully unlocked etc etc. Don’t get scared off by the bad reviews, the few people who get a bad phone are just more likely to leave a review, and if yours is broken you can j get a replacement one.

I payed more but didn’t really get the quality ensured, so I would buy the cheaper renewed one.Edit: I changed the review after contacting product/costumer support.

  The phone was listed as:Renewed , All Carriers ,  Apple iPhone XR, 128GB, Black - Fully Unlocked (Renewed).However, when I went to the T-Mobile/Sprint store, the technician indicated that the phone was locked, after I stood in line to await my turn. I am disabled and have limited stamina and mobility. This mistake may seem minor, however, it was a major issue for me.  I had to find a store to print my return label. Then I had to locate an open USP drop off center.  With waiting in line, and travel time, these tasks took over two hours. I absolutely love, love, love Amazon; however, this phone issue was disappointing. I will have someone to help me purchase a phone locally. I appreciate your consistent outstanding customer service.  Thank you and happy  holidays.

  I received my XR, 256GB Black, two days ago to replace two iPhone 6 64GB units I have used since 2015. It has been worth every cent! I wanted dual SIM (one physical SIM card and one eSIM) and it works flawlessly on the two completely different networks I use (one for my local country and the other my roaming number from my home country). The device arrived in a generic box and with a generic Lightning cable (which looks and feels much better than the original Lightning cable from Apple) as indicated by the seller but the unit itself is like new. I even have Apple Care for one year from the date of purchase. There is not a scratch or blemish anywhere to be found, whether on the front or back.The XR is obviously a huge step forward from the 6, which is starting to show its age. At the price I paid, this is an exceptional bargain, so I purchased two identical devices so that my SO does not feel left out.

  10 days after my return window has closed and my Apple iPhone X that I purchased from this company has completely shut down. It’s frozen on the apple icon and I’ve tried several “boot loop” trouble shooting methods- nothing. I paid almost $500 for this. Total loss as far as I can see and conveniently I’m not able to contact the seller. Absolutely DISGUSTED. I am a long time Amazon customer. I have bought at least FOUR iPhones from Amazon, many other electronics, appliances, housewares, clothes, pet supplies, etc. If this cannot be resolved I am THROUGH with Amazon.

",1.0 ,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States May 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  They had a disclaimer upfront that the battery was at least at 80% capacity. So I thought ""Cool, that just means the phone will die a little faster. This was the case and then some. As I was transferring my things from my old phone to my new one, I kept the new one on the charger and fully charged it before use. When the transfer was done I was very content with my new iPhone and was readily exploring the new features. The first thing I noticed was that the new phone was unable to display the battery percentage, I found this pretty odd since every other phone can do this simple feature. A few minutes later, I receive a prompt letting me know that the battery in my iPhone was not genuine and that I needed to call apple support. After a conversation with apple support, they suggested that I send the phone in for diagnostics and repairs, and because we are amid a global pandemic, I knew this would take forever, but I had no choice. So this now leaves me 3 weeks later with no phone back and a feeling of regret.

  The refurbished iPhone XR arrived in excellent shape.  Perfect screen condition, no scratches on body, no visual damages at all.  The phone looks brand new.  Battery is at 93%.  The seller even threw in a few screen protection sheets and a protection case.  Very much appreciated!  Just for reference, earlier a competitor sent me a XR at a 10% higher price with a screen in terrible condition (three visible scratches that became even more noticeable when the phone got powered up).  I returned it.  Shipment costs on me ….  Refund has not been issued yet.  So, it is a gamble.

  I understand the phone is “renewed.” When I unpackaged the phone I noticed a weird spot on the bottom of the screen. Upon further inspection with a magnifying glass, there was a chip and crack in the screen. I tried to contact the sellers and received no response even after two emails. I have several iPhone XR‘s in the family and they are good phones. My compliant is with the seller and receiving no response. I kept the phone (it’s for a 12 y/o that will probably crack it anyway).

  Extremely disappointed in this product and the fact that Apple is the seller standing behind the product. I spend $434 on a product that claims to be “renewed.” Specifically detailing the following: “Professionally inspected and tested to work and look like new, with minimal to no signs of wear, by an Amazon-qualified supplier, who is not Apple certified.“ The phone has signs of wear and tear, front to back, as shown in the attached - not what you’d deem “minimal to no signs” and absolutely not what you’d seem as “like new.” I hope Amazon improves the quality of their products, specifically ones advertising as new for almost the price of a new phone sold directly through Apple.

  So happy with my purchase! I did have a problem with the sound of my calls at first but I call Amazon  Renew and they sent me a return label right away and I was able to send the phone back. I received an email 4 days later apologizing for the inconvenience, saying they received my phone and my new phone on its way. I received my new phone the next day and it worked perfectly.  I'm not only happy with the phone but very pleased with the service. Will definitely recommend buying from them if you need a phone.  Oh I forgot to mention the free phone case and screen protector I also received with the phone. Pleasantly surprised

  Came in good condition, however there was slight damage from shipping but was not noticeable. After 2 days of usage, the battery health went from 100 to 96. The phone can overheat easily which caused the battery to weaken. But, everything else is perfectly fine. I highly recommend this phone since it was very cheap and worth the money.

  This is the second iPhone XR that I buy from Amazon renewed. All I can say is that these phones are almost in new condition. As for battery life they have came in around 90% at maximum capacity, witch for being more then $100 off then original price I don’t mind getting it second hand. Plus you get 90 day warranty. So it’s a no brainer. Make this purchase, you won’t regret it!

  Not renewed like amazon likes to claim these products are, is not near like new, to be fair is in good condition, but that wasn’t the deal when the advertise “ to look and work like new”. I have bought refurbish phones before that you can tell they were summited to a reconditioning process, not this phone, it looks like my actual phone that i have been using for 8 months. The amount of dust and sweat that loge by the conector and speaker holes tells me that this phone has been use for at least a year and they barely wipe it before shipping it to me... kind of nasty to be honest.Am giving it another try and I hope I get what they are advertising.

  Man of Man where do I start??... I must say that I searched high and low for an affordable iPhone for my son birthday as he wanted to switch over from android and join the apple world like his Dad and I. That is when I landed on this baby right here. I have never been one very fond of renew devices because of how the appearance might look of issues with the device itself, but upon receiving this device from Amazon it blew my expectations out of the water. I was completely amazed by how like-new this device looked it came with a screen protector and case and a 90 day warranty guarantee what else more can a mother asked for. My son was over joyed ands loved his phone which made me really happy to know that it put a smile on my face as well as his. I will definitely be using amazon in the future for device purchases.

  Honestly the phone isn’t bad for a renewed one. Battery Efficiency came at 91% so that’s pretty good. Only thing I found upsetting was the camera quality. The quality on mines wasn’t the best. When you aren’t in good lighting, the pictures have android quality. However, when you have nice lighting or go outside, the lighting looks amazing.

For the size of it , it was surprisingly light.I definitely would have kept it, if it wasn't that I needed the best camera possible just for my work.(I am a Micro-blading technician, taking pictures of my work)So, in short if you need a great phone with a great camera for everyday use then the IPhone XR is the sure one to buy. I like the IPhone XR actually better then the IPhone 11Pro that i have now. But again the camera for work made the decision for me.

  Everything worked out great. Shipped on time and there is no visible damage on the phone. The only problem is that one of the speakers' sound quality isn't great. May have been damaged from the previous owner. However, I understand that this was refurbished, so that is okay. Thank you!

  Looks great. Feels like a second hand manufacturer though being honest. Not in an apple box or with an apple case/charge it’s a store bought charger. I thought everything was good till I discovered a crack. Thought it was the screen protector so I take it off to change it and there’s a crack right along the E in update if you look. So kind disappointed

  Love this phone! I made the switch from an android device to this iPhone XR and the difference in camera quality and speed is quite substantial. Although, the phone came with one broken speaker grill at the bottom, a missing screw next to the charger port, and a quite noticeable scratch on the top left of the phone, these complications did not effect my every day usage. So far I have been able to use the phone without any problems.

There were absolutely no screen defects whatsoever and the setup and install went very smooth.  I took the SIM card out of my old iPhone and placed it into this new iPhone and immediately was able to make phone calls.  Even when i logged into my Verizon account, my profile identified this new phone to my phone number.  I would definitely make this purchase again.

  It’s refurbished so I was not expecting perfection , the phone itself came looking beautiful only defect was the red paint around the camera lens was chipping away but the rest of the phone was perfect . However the charger it came with did not work at all so I had to order a new one . Not good 👎🏽 Also the screen glitches a lot . It will touch things /type when my finger is not even on the screen and sometimes too when I touch the screen it doesn’t work , I will have to click it off and on again for it to move . It works for the most part and the camera is ok but probably if you want an iPhone just go buy a new one

Guys I was skeptical but I swear I got a brand new phone and it was worth it. I also must say the seller is very pleasant and answered my every question on time

  Was kind of skeptical at first, kept stalling buying the iPhone because I wasn't sure if buying it brand new directly from Apple would be a smart decision. Really glad I decided to take the plunge.  Came in a timely manner, was in perfect condition. Very tiny discoloration at the corner of the screen but that's negligible, the risk was probable. Got the black one, and was glad I got basically a new one for about $200 less than the brand new price. Hoping that this phone lasts me many more years!!! :)

  I’ve heard so much about I phone. I’ve been a life long Samsung Galaxy user. I know that I phone is simple to operate but totally backwards from what I’m use too. I made the switch for better security. I did purchase an I phone XR which I’m told seems to be there budget phone. My $99. 00 Samsung has a better crisper picture and seems to take pictures just as well. I’ve only owned the I phone 3 weeks and admit I haven’t totally figured it out yet but I have enjoyed it thus far. I’m still partial to my Samsung tho.

  There are a lot of bad reviews out there so I thought I should share that I’ve had my phone for a week and it has done fine. It is really hard to trust a company that only has bad views, and phones are never always perfect. I actually only bought this phone because I saw another guy who got a yellow one and it was fine. I also got yellow because it was the cheapest option for me.  It has been a week. Good so far. It was unlocked, had no cosmetic damage and I had to set it up with my iCloud account just like normal. It’s been great and I’ll update if it’s not.

  No scratches no finger prints no cracks on the screen! The iphone XR is great for most purposes, social media, games, and streaming videos, which makes it very convenient. It does indeed have a 1080p resolution screen. After getting to level 19 in hole.io the amount of objects loading and your hole’s size started were what I believe started the temperature of the phone to raise. Battery life is very useful, it can last the whole time your awake (7-14hours) on 50% brightness. In fact, i’m using it right now to write this review. My only real complaint is the price, most iPhones are very expensive, but for the newest model iPhone this is pretty cheap.

  Phone looked brand new, was super clean and ready to rock. Unfortunately unlocked phones do not work with Boost Mobile only Boost Mobile devices will work on their network in the USA. Perhaps seller doesn't know this but may consider adding to description. I tried repeatedly to plug-in the IMEI on Boost's website and it kept spitting out an error message. After calling support— they said they could not swap me to this device. Oh well.

  Everything is good on this phone except for one thing. It won’t activate when I put my SIM card in. The cellular update keeps failing. I was thinking that maybe it’s the SIM card or something like that but it’s most definitely the phone. I must have got this from a bad batch because AT&T couldn’t even help me. If Apple can’t help me when I go to them, I’ll have to do some further action.

  This phone is a great deal for the price. The only reason why I didn’t give it 5 stars was because it had a few scuffs and scraps around the sides. I don’t mind them so long as it doesn’t effect the phones quality or efficiency. The battery life could be a little better, but I don’t know if that’s Apple’s fault or the seller. Either way that doesn’t deter me either. I will be purchasing from this seller again in the future if they continue such great quality products.I will update this post in a few months to let everyone know the life of this phone as well. I plan on keeping this phone as long as it lasts (which will hopefully be up to 2 years)

I’ll edit the review if I find something wrong.

  I absolutely love this phone! I was very skeptical and scared to purchase due to the many bad reviews. I decided to give it a try anyway, because I really needed a new phone. BEST CHOICE BY FAR! Literally looks exactly like the picture, the screen is amazing , and the picture quality is even better! The setup was literally under 15 minutes, and it took only 2 seconds to switch my SIM card to this phone and my service was automatically connected. Also for those who want to know, this is compatible with cricket. I am a cricket customer and you literally only have to change the SIM card over, now I was coming from a iPhone 6 so I had to flip my sim upside down to fit in properly. If you don’t feel uncomfortable doing it yourself you can totally go in a store and have them do it and it’s FREE! Wish I had pictures but I’m currently using it! :). Also it doesn’t come with headphones but I did purchase AirPods, plus I had my own set of headphones, it does come with a charger. The charger isn’t from Apple so I decided not to use that charger, but everything else is great. It comes very secured in a brown box packaged very well, and the shipping was super fast. I ordered my phone on a Thursday it came on Saturday.  Definitely would recommend!

  Everything of great about this phone as far as hardware and software. The phone arrived was early as well. But.. it is not fully unlocked for every carrier and that needs to be specified in the description info. Carriers use direct tech for their cashing and internet services. For example, att, cricket and simple mobile run on one tech, and Verizon runs on another. I wanted a phone to connect with Verizon and could not, because this phone is unlocked, but not with Verizon.. fyi

The battery health is 99% so it’s pretty much a new phone. As far as cosmetic, I only found one little scratch which is not visible with the case I bought for it. Also, the phone IS unlocked. I already tried two different SIM cards and it worked great.The phone does not come with headphones or an original charger but the seller has those specifications in the product description.I do recommend this phone and the seller! 👌🏻👌🏻👌🏻

Phone was nicely packaged in a plastic wrap, on first sight I thought it was a new phone. I inspected the hell out it. It’s in absolutely pristine condition. Absolutely no marks on this phone. It’s beautiful. I was a little worried when I turned it on to set it up and update iOS. It had stated it would take 7 hours but it actually took maybe 2 hours (a little less).  Battery is great at 100%. So far I have no complaints about this phone. I’m giving it 4 stars just because I just got it.  The description of the phone and it’s components are exactly what I got. No more no less. I’m happy!!!!

  I received my refurbished iPhone yesterday, and so far it has been functioning well. The battery health on the phone says 100%, and there is only minimal evident scratching on the back. My only issue is with whoever put the tempered screen protector on the phone. They must have some serious hand-eye coordination problems as the glass is horribly off center and slightly hangs off the bottom. I’m going to look around to see if any shops can remove it and reapply it correctly, it is pretty annoying and if I had seen images of it beforehand I definitely would have not purchased the phone.

  It was overall a pretty good phone with no damage or malfunctions. Came in three days with prime shipping. The only thing thqt displeased me was that there are five or six micro scratches on the phone. Although they're barely noticeable, I expected one to two max. Other than that, it worked out well. If you're purchasing this expect a scratch or two, but you can't really complain for under 700 bucks.

  I love how A good price I got this phone for it's just has a little scratch but that's what happens when you get refurbished Items but I'm complaining about the battery life I charged it to 100% and I only used it for 7 mins I thought I had a good buy but to check the battery percentage it dropped significantly at first I thought I was tripping it came to me at 50 percent and it died fast so I let it charge to 100 and as you can see the picture it dies fast I needed a replacement because my oldnphone broke just be careful if any of you guys going to buy it and this happens I never complained about anything or reviewed stuff but just be sure to look out for little things like that I contacted the seller I'm just waiting to see what he or she to respond

  I’m rewriting my review as the first one was not accepted by amazon. Poor quality control and was LOCKED, unlike advertisement. Cell phone carrier could not unlock and had to return. My experience is similar to many that have 1 Star. Very frustrated as I had Boyle screen protectors, case etc in anticipation for using XR. Will now wait for the iPhone 9 or whatever they will call it. Will never use this co again. Their generic email as a response suggested it was a wrong item, not that this was defective.

One of my best experiences buying renewed devices from amazon!Speaking on the phone itself, using it for a few days I could hardly tell a difference between the iPhone 11 and the XR. Feels like the exact same phone minus one more camera. If you were considering buying this, I think you should go ahead! Solid buy!

  I love it so much! I really came to write a review because I had a problem with other people's reviews. If your phone comes in cracked or damaged- 99% of the time it's because of transportation, not the seller. You also have 90 days to return/replacement and it's easy and fast with amazon. If the phone's software has an issue- that is where you blame the seller. That is why I never buy/don't buy something based off reviews EVER.

  I had to get it replaced. The first one I ordered didn’t work. You couldn’t charge it. I reached out to customer service and they were very helpful and replaced it. I am glad they did because the first one was a little worn looking as well. May have been just a dud. The replacement looked like new and has worked great. The replacement did take longer than I wanted to arrive but it wasn’t such a big deal. This is a good alternative to buying new the price point worked great for us. I’d definitely buy again if I needed to.

  I use straight talk through Verizon towers and this phone works perfectly for this. The only problem I had was when setting up the phone I had to create a Apple ID but got a message saying that the phone has had too many people make a new ID on it, so I just skipped that part. After setting up the phone, I went back to the settings and tried setting up an ID again, and this time it let me do it. Not sure what was up there but just an FYI. Other than that this phone is perfect, and I am very happy with my purchase. Mine came with charger only, but phone had no scuffs or scratches.

  So when I got this phone, it was dead and I thought all I needed to do was charge it. After hours of waiting it turned on, but seconds later the screen started bugging and glitching out while slowly turning black. I thought it was because it was still dead so I charged it for days and it still didn’t work. Honestly not worth it especially for the price. The box isn’t very good and secure and the charger isn't even an apple one, the box I got was something off brand. Honestly the only reason I rated a 2 star is because they had good communication and I was able to get the refund by the time their warranty said I should get it. Took about a whole week for the refund to come through, if you still don’t t get a refund I suggest talking to them about it.

  Love it, there isn’t a headphone or original charger but I’m not worried about that. The setup was a pain but now everything is working perfectly. There are no scratches, battery life on setting says 100%. I checked the serial number, it’s legit. I do have to say, the shipping company (fedex) was horrible but that’s not on the seller. The phone is perfect.

  I bought this phone about 3-4 days ago. It came on time and I was quite happy. Once I inserted the sim card, it would search for it then say no service. I went to T-mobile and they said the phone may have been blocked. Though it was a beautiful phone, I had to get it refunded I might buy it again and update my review.

  The screen would stuck and the touch would not work, you have to close whatever is on the screen and reopen it. The problem was there the moment I took the iPhone out of the box. I thought the issue will be resolved once I upgrade it to the latest iOS but that didn't work. The phone still will get unresponsive and I have to close and reopen everything. I trusted a renewed product only because I thought that I can return it if something doesn't work but the return process is very stupid. I have to talk to an agent then he will give me useless troubleshooting steps to follow such as resetting the phone. I know the problem is not a software. I simply didn't expect this. Very frustrating.

  Bought this iPhone for my husband exactly 2 months ago yesterday. This weekend the phone died and wouldn’t charge. It was stuck in a boot loop then said it needed to be updated. Update didn’t work so then it said to restore iPhone. That didn’t work either. Turns out the memory has failed and we now have to pay over $200 to have it repaired. That’s half the price of the phone we just paid for. Pretty irritating. Wouldn’t recommend their “renewed” products.

  I was very hesitant to buy a used phone. It's hard to know exactly what you are going to get. Of course, you want to believe it is going to be perfect but you do have to be realistic, because it's used. I'm happy to report the phone was nearly perfect. It has no scratches at all, no marks or anything negative about the appearance. I took it to get a sim card and everything transferred perfectly from my old phone. I didn't miss a beat. I know some people are particular about this one but I did get an Apple brand charging cable too. The battery was full and it lasts a long time! I go all day with using various apps and phone calls and even use it with the controller while flying my drone. At bedtime, around 1:00am, I still have about 50% battery left from the charge the night before. The only thing weird is the iPhone podcast app does not work. It says ""There is a problem and the Podcast Library needs to be rebuilt before continuing."" When I click Rebuild Library, it never finishes doing anything. I have even kept touching the screen to keep the phone from going to sleep in hopes that the rebuild would be successful. I eventually deleted the app and re-downloaded it from the App Store. Everything seemed to be fine and then... I got the same message. I will eventually take it to the Apple Store to see what they can do but for now, the rest is perfect and I am glad I saved a few hundred bucks.

  They get one star for fast shipping and that about the only positive thing I have to say. Could not get service after installing SIM card and resetting phone multiple times tried inserting both my SIM card and the one from my wife’s phone and neither worked. Verified that both SIM cards worked in her phone which is an iPhone XR that she got a week ago from another company and they worked fine. Can’t tell you much else about this company because I didn’t get that far but won’t buy from them again simply because the device I was sent was faulty which leads me to believe they don’t check devices as well as they claim or it wasn’t fully unlocked like they claim.

  I’ve bought iPhones new ever since 2006 when I bought the very first model. I’ve never ever considered refurbished especially for a phone, but I decided to take a risk. Mainly because I REALLY wanted the XR in blue in 256gb and Apple stopped offering this model (to entice you towards the more recent models). I wanted to get the best XR I could because it’s the last LCD display by Apple w the best battery. I want this phone to last 3-5 years. I spent $580 after tax, and I got what cost $1000 about a year and a half ago. There’s not a single scratch on my phone, the battery life came with 100% health! It honestly feels like someone owned this phone for less than a week, and gave it back and it was “refurbished”. Very impressed, can’t believe I got a brand new battery. Chubbiestech was my seller

Well since they are renew, I guess that is something to be expected .. above all , the iPhone seem to work just normal. I was a little worry because of all the bad comments but I guess it all depend in each case..

  The product seller, HavEarly is a poor seller. They sold me an unlocked iPhone XR and after using it for 8 months on att, I decided to switch to Verizon where I discovered it was NOT unlocked. Seller told me oh well, you should have checked this before return date ended. Poor excuse for customer service.

  Well, it looked good, so two stars. I have always feared buying phones described as ""unlocked."" After investing the usual amount of time in transferring my information to the shiny new phone, the sim card could not be read. I called apple who confirmed that this phone was locked. This is ridiculous. My time is far more valuable than the money I would have saved on this purchase. FYI- BuySPRY's customer support is only open during business hour- very inconvenient. Thank you, amazon, for a robust return policy- such a shame an hour of my life will never be returned.

So far I've had no issues with the phone, it came with a charger, no headphones though! which is perfectly fine (I have my own regardless) I think it just random if you get all the products or not. But either way you are paying for the phone and it's a great price anyways, comes with what you need so take a chance it may end in an amazing purchase!Will update as time goes on as I've only recently received it!

  i would give this 0 stars. got the phone, turned on without me even pressing it. was weirded out but ignored it. it worked perfectly fine until i put in my credit card info, created an apple id account, password and face id, and transferred photos. this is when the phone completely shut off. the next day it turned on and turned off at possibly the exact time it turned off the day before. it seems they set these phones to only turn on long enough for you to do enough to only get a partial refund...

  Got the phone recently and at first I actually thought it was great. It seems to be in great hands and  looks brand new. Zero scratches and the battery life is also great however, after a week of buying it the speaker stopped working and it was completely unprovoked. I didn't drop it and do anything to it. When I started calling people they were not able to hear me. I did everything I could to solve the issue but nothing would work so I returned it. I hope I just got a bad phone because I still want the phone. Aside from that issue it is a great phone.

The phone is slow and you can tell something has happened to it. If they are going to sell products at this quality it should be HALF as much as they are selling it for. Not original charger, no headphones.

  This phone did not work right straight out of the box. The company claims to do a check of all the components but they clearly do not since then sent me a phone where the microphones and camera didn't work. 6 hours to set up the phone with updated software, transfer of data from my old phone and then a trip to Verizon to activate the phone proved to be a waste of time.

  Came in sooner than expected but no service when sim was inserted and found a dead pixel. Tried everything but nothing worked. It shouldn’t be that hard for my service to work since it worked on my old phone. It was literally an all day thing trying to get the service to work and my finally gave up and returned it only one day after I got it. All that I research that it may be potentially stolen, still locked or a hardware issue because it seriously could not get service. The dead pixel wouldn’t have bother if the phone actually worked. They couldn’t even take off the lining of the adhesive to properly tape it together. I’m seriously disappointed. Never ever buying from the seller Gryphon Commerce.

  This phone came early and in great condition. I was very hesitant to buy a phone on amazon but a friend suggested it after I tried to buy from Facebook  and it didn’t work out. There are no scratches, came with a charger and sim pin. I’ve checked the camera and the speakers also working well. I’m very happy with this purchase. This is not a scam.

  Everything about this phone is just amazing ! I was soooo scared to order at first but I literally scrolled thru all the reviews and was just like why not ? And I’m glad I didn’t listen to the bad reviews I’m so glad I didn’t ! Just got my package today I was sooo nervous to open it but when I did I was amazed at how it came in there’s not one scratch or dent or any other damage you would describe on this phone ! Screen is pretty sensitive if you ask me and the camera is beautiful ! Oh and it also works with cricket guys so I’d definitely get it unlocked if you’re a cricket customer like me :) also I just wanna say I brought this from seller MyWit , very good service ! And I would show vids or pictures of the phone but I’m obviously on it now lol just kno this phone is in great condition almost as if its really brand new . Battery life is good too . charges up pretty fast if you ask me and the phone does last awhile I doubt you’d even need a charger to go anywhere with it and also I see how some reviews complain about how it doesn’t come with headphones .. but obviously if you read about the phone and what the seller says about it you’d see that it stated no headphones comes with the package but best believe a charger does ! So yeah I’m glad I didn’t listen to the negative reviews even tho I was worried everyday that I was waitin for my package to come . Other than that I HIGHLYYY RECOMMEND buying a phone from here !

I would recommend getting the productRED edition since there are numerous good reviews of it and pictures showing them looking like-new. Was afraid of getting a phone with an activation lock but luckily that didn’t happen. In the end, it’s really your prerogative

  I got my phone today, and was extremely relieved and satisfied. The phone came intact with a generic iphone charger and block which was fine with me. It also transferred everything from my old iphone to this one within 20 minutes which was very convenient. The phone has a clean, nice condition screen and back, and the cameras checked out fine. I don't know if I missed this part in the description but it also came with a case for the phone, and it is of good quality. I was the most excited about the battery health, which the settings told me the phone had a 94% battery life! I was worried when the description of this phone said it would have at least 80% battery life, but overall I could not have been more satisfied!

    Bad front camera quality
  
",2.0 ,Mallorie Wilson,"Reviewed in the United States June 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  The phone was obviously used. The edges were a little scraped up and there was a lot of gunk in the speaker next to the front camera. None of this was bad enough to make me want to get rid of it. What made me return the phone was the fact that the front camera quality was terrible. The 1st pic is the Amazon phone front camera. The 2nd pic is the Apple store front camera. I mainly bought this phone FOR the cameras (I feel like most people do.) While the back camera was fine, the front one was a deal breaker. I considered asking for another phone from the company, but for $150 more I would have rather purchased a brand new iPhone and save myself the worry. I originally thought I’d be saving some money, but it wasn’t worth it in the end.

  The phone in perfect condition. Not a stock charger or ear phones but I’m not bothered about that. They said fully unlocked and the phone was not. After attempting to connect the phone to my service(sprint) they told me that the phone was made for strictly T-noble use. T- mobile uses GSM frequency while Sprint uses CDMA. In other words, it can’t work with Sprint thus, not fully unlocked. They failed to mention anything about GSM or CDMA. I would not recommend buying any product from BuySPRY.

No other dents dings or scratches anywhere. Phone is valid and official, in fact there is 6 month factory warranty left on the phone. Battery life is great, lasted 2 days of normal use which is incredible.  Phone was unlocked as advertised, and worked with my Cricket sim no problem. Charges quickly, very fast phone.

  This phone is AWESOME and in 9.9999/10 condition! Buying an Amazon Renewed product comes with a little bit of a lowered expectation for appearance and battery life. However, and that's a big however, this phone was pristine! My order was fulfilled by TRADEMORE. The screen is in perfect shape and is responsive as it should be. Faced works great. The cameras have no wear and work perfectly. The body has one tiny visible scratch that is completely covered by the case. Battery life is 100%! I spent weeks looking for a refurb phone in excellent condition that wasn't overpriced and I'm so glad I went for this one. It also came with Apple branded cable and block which was a huge surprise. Note that every phone is going to be different when you're buying Renewed, but this was a total win. Before this I had ordered a Renewed iPhone XS (it came from a different fulfiller - Kiss Electronics Inc) and it came with a chipped camera, visible scratches, and the sticky cover on the phone was covered in hairs and fibers. It was a huge disappointment and I had to pay return shipping on it. I'm so glad I went for the XR and it far exceeded all of my expectations. I highly recommend!

  I was skeptical about buying this phone considering the bad reviews but so far, this phone is a pretty good deal considering the low price. This phone is refurbished so it makes sense that it has a couple minor scratches on the front and back side of the phone. Nothing too major though.The battery life is also really good.

  I know the idea of a ""renewed"" or ""refurbished"" phone may seem scary to some people. I was really worried before I bought this.  I couldn't believe the deal I got getting this phone and thought it was too good to be true and I'd have to deal with a faulty device. Well, boy was I proven wrong! My phone came fully unlocked as it stated and all I had to do was pop my Sim Card from my iPhone 6 into this iPhone XR and it worked! It started the setup process immediately. All apps work, calling, texting, settings, are working. I am really glad I took a chance on getting this phone to save a couple hundred dollars on a newer model. If you're considering getting this phone, GET IT. You won't be disappointed.

  I don’t know about the battery life or any of that, I received this phone two days ago, and just got it set up to my girlfriend’s carrier today. She calls me on speakerphone and all I can hear on my end is static. She turns off the speaker and unless she has her mouth wrapped around the end of the phone, I can’t hear a damn thing she’s saying. For this kind of money, you’d think that someone wouldn’t sell you a cheap piece of defective crap!

Didn’t rate all five stars because there is always room for improvement. All in all I would definitely recommend buying this if you are searching for a used iPhone that is under a thousand dollars.

  The phone was not paid off, it would not work for my SIM card which is T-Mobile based.The T-Mobile tech said the phone was unlocked but not paid off when my SIM card was inserted the phone keep trying to pull up a previous plan from the previous owner's of the device, the tech said the only reason a fully unlocked iphone wouldn't take a new SIM card is cause the previous person leased to own the phone and didn't pay it off and sold it.this phone is junk and unusable.

",2.0 ,B,"Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2019","









  
  
    
  I figured with the description of such slight defects that may be acceptable by Amazon for a refurbished iPhone XR it would be worth it to save $99 by ordering a refurbished for $500 rather than order a brand new one from Apple for $599.When I first opened the box, updated the phone and got it set up with my apps, everything was great. Then I went to the Apple store to buy a screen protector and some other accessories. When I was putting on the screen protector I noticed a crack which runs almost the entire length of the screen. It appears the seller buffed this and possibly used a glass filler to hide the cracked screen. I’ve taken photos to share.I ordered this phone as I’m traveling and needed a new phone. Well I have no choice but to eat this scam by Amazon and the seller because I’m traveling and don’t have an option to not use this phone.Amazon should require high quality photos of actual products on sale. Not images copied from Apples marketing of a product.

  Just want to share some up to date feedback for those looking. If I am pleasantly surprised by an experience, I feel I owe the company some good feedback. I took a chance and ordered a renewed unlocked white iphone XR phone from this listing. Tech Exchange was the seller who fulfilled the order.-Phone arrived on time in pristine condition. I couldn't find a scratch on it.-It had a glass screen protector already applied. This was a nice bonus.-The ""battery health"" indicator in iOS showed 100%. I was expecting since it was renewed it would be off a couple percentage points.-I've activated the phone with dual sim on verizon and google fi's networks. So no issues with the phone being sim-locked.-The phone has otherwise worked flawlessly. I've had it for about 2 weeks now.I am super happy with this purchase and would recommend it to anyone on the fence.

  Electric Drewgaloo Review Guru: So I got this phone for my wife for her birthday. I was upgrading from her 6s so she was excited. As soon as she opened her face went from excitement to fake forced enthusiasm. The phone camera lens was covered in dirt and the paint was chipped around the lens. The charger is a 3rd party Nokia charger and the lightning cable looks like the one you get when you are waiting in line at Walgreens. Very disappointed with this lackluster effort. Could have been executed way better. Returned immediately.Pros:  arrived quickly  turns on  Easy returnCons: camera lens scratched  phone was dirty with sand or dirt  paint chipped around camera lens  3rd party Nokia charger  No headphones

  PERFECT condition!! The screen works great and the camera quality is amazing. The battery health is at 90%, but it said it would be at least 80% so that’s to be expected.

  Def wasn’t sure after reading all the reviews. Who wants to gamble $400+ but so far I love this phone. Once I unboxed it I checked it for scratches etc. Didn’t find any. Looks brand new  Phone arrived a day early. I bought the coral one. Recommend 10/10

  I was a little nervous after reading some reviews but I received my device early and I gotta say I absolutely love my new phone. There is no defects at all and looks like a new device the battery health was at 98% and didn’t have any problems setting up my device. It was completely unlocked like they said in the description. It’s completely worth buying.

  My phone came today (the day I’m writing this review) in new condition and it’s fully unlocked! It has no scratches or cracks and it was 84% charged when it was delivered. It also came wit a screen protector on it which was a bonus! 10/10 would recommend this company as my mom also purchased a phone from them.

    Screen Malfunction
  
",3.0 ,ashley b,"Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased this phone as an upgrade from my iPhone 7plus other than it missing a fave feature of mine, the 3D Touch this phone is definitely an upgrade.The quality of the device I received was decent. No obvious scratches, dings, or issues. The main complaint I have is that every about ten minutes of use or so, my screen is unresponsive. I have to completely click off my screen and reopen my device to regain control of the screen again. Idk what the issue is but I have updated the device, turned it all the way off and on again so now my only hunch, is that it was due to this being a refurbished device. I just wish it was disclosed in the product description.I feel with this malfunction the value for money isn’t quite there, but that’s what I get for purchasing online I suppose.Buyers please purchase with caution and knowledge that you may receive a device that only works sometimes!

It came with a screen protector, sim removal tool, charger, and a box! And it came 3 days early! No complaints from me!!

  Phone is not unlocked to carriers and when you try to add it to any service provider they will say the imei number is invalid meaning it’s not a real device. I made the seller aware of the issue and was ensured I would be refunded. I placed the phone in a plain box and secured the phone with foam. After reaching out multiple times, I get a message saying “unfortunately the time is damaged and we can’t refund you because we don’t cover physical damage”. I made them aware that the item wasn’t damaged when I shipped it! THE WHOLE ISSUE IS THIS PHONE HAS A FALSE IMEI # AND CANNOT CONNECT TO CARRIERS So it’s basically a brick. All they keep saying is they can’t do anything. I’m pretty sure the phone was intentionally cracked so that they could continue with there scam and not refund me. I didn’t even ask for an actual refund. I just wanted the phone unlocked the way it is advertised. So now I’m out of $500 with a brick... that’s now magically cracked. PLEASE BE CAREFUL!

  The phone is in really good physical condition. Only issue was the top speaker being distorted when playing sound. Though it is functional and I am still able to make calls and hear them clearly, it is a slight bummer. I can't really complain as the price of the phone was really good and the seller is giving me a $20 refund. Overall, great buy.

  I was a little sceptical buying this phone because some of the reviews said that the phone they received was locked or had slight damage. However, the one I received was perfect. It came fully unlocked and  undamaged. It looks as if I had baught it straight from apple. So far an overall 5 stars and no complaints.

I was hesitant to buy it due to the bad reviews, but my phone is unlocked (checked with Apple) and I love it. My seller was 2019bestsale, it’s a little bit more expensive but worth it.
