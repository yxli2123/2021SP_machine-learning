    Not bad
  
",5.0,tattoofox,"Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2021","









  
  
    
  We were hoping to play a few games like roblox on the pc, and learned it required a pricey cord. Okay fine, we found a cheap one.Then we discovered that NONE of our computers, even our 4 year old gaming Lenovo laptop, had enough to run it.Super disappointing, but I guess we should have researched better.The graphics are pretty good and so far the two games and several demos we’ve tried out are pretty fun.I (35f) tend to get mildly motion sick when I play this, so I only do it in blips.The rollercoaster game literally made me so sick I had to lay down trying not to puke for like 30 minutes.I know. I’m pretty hardcore.Anyways, of motion sickness is a thing, try one before you buy one.I’m looking forward to buying a few  games, although I’m somewhat disappointed at the limited selection of free activities considering how pricey this thing is, but, alright, I get it.All in all it was a hit with my daughter.Not perfect, but what is.

    Fantastic for the price
  
",4.0,David Stevenson,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  I received mine only today, so I haven't played with it a ton, but to me it's a solid 4 stars out of 5.  Why?For the price, it is a FANTASTIC entry into VR.  I'm a Mac guy, so having an all-in-one system finally cuts the cable between the headset and a PC that I don't own.  I can toss it in a backpack and take it to a friend's house, and not worry about lugging around computer along with it.My cons so far:• My eyes are somewhere between 2 of the 3 IPD presets.  I haven't found the setting that feels comfortable, but I'm trying to move the lenses *between* the presets to find it.  It's close, but it's definitely not right.  This is the reason I didn't give it 5 stars.• I don't love that it's tied to my Facebook account (which I knew beforehand), and I'd like to know more specifics about what they track.  If they're just tracking what I'm playing, then I don't mind that they show me targeted ads.  But the Quest 2 has cameras and a microphone, and I'd like to know if those are sending any information back to Zuck.

  We are now awaiting our third Oculus Quest 2 to show up. The first one had good lenses but now has 2 dead pixels, squeaky controllers and looses connectivity when you turn around too much. We love the product but it seems Oculus has no quality control on what seems to be a difficult item to manufacture with precision. We have read of people going through 12 units to get a good one...  Maybe the quality is going down as our first two units were initially very very good. Over time one set has started to fail after 4 weeks. But thinking about it -  4 weeks isn't very long!! If you go down this road make sure you have stamina for returning - reordering the product...

    Facebook Disabled  New Account  - Unable to Set up Headset For 2 days  DLNA IS NOW SUPPORTED 11-22
  
",4.0,Smart Shopper,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  Must have a Facebook account to set up Oculus 2. I set up  a new Facebook account just to use Oculus 2 and set every privacy setting at max. Then Facebook disabled account for no reason after 1hr of having a new account. I did not set up a fake account , used my real name and info, did not even make one comment , or post a picture. Never even used Facebook. Facebook still disabled my account even though I followed all community standards.  I am unable to set up my Oculus 2 headset without a Facebook account. I am now forced to return headset before my last return date for a full refund since it will not work without a active Facebook account. So glad this happened within my full refund window with Amazon. Headset is worthless without Facebook account. Oculus go still works fine because you don't need Facebook account to set one up.If you can get your headset set up then it seems like a nice vr headset.when I try to log on Facebook now this is what I getIf we still find that your account didn't follow our Community Standards, it will remain disabled.We're always looking out for the security of people on Facebook, so until then you can't use your accountI complained to Oculus since i had an account with my oculus go headset . Sent them 5 emails about his issue. Facebook asked for picture and phone number but did not ask for id. My vpn showed i was in panama and this is the only reason why i think they disabled account so quickly and for no reason. After sending picture account was listed again. I now can use my Quest 2. Don't even try to use a fake name or account. Read below whyHaving a Facebook account should not be a deal breaker for this fine headset. I did not put any pictures on it and put all settings at max  which means only me. There are a lot of setting you have to change but after doing so I don't feel threated by Facebook. All the ads setting and links i put on no - off - or max which is only me. I did not even put app on phone because i will never use  it. I just signed up to use  oculus 2. All setting on quest are just for me. I will never use Facebook for anything else. I have no pictures, no friends, no links on Facebook don't use app on phone don't even have it installed. No phone number on my account. Just block everything and don't use Facebook for any contact to anyone. All setting on oculus are at max  privacy. There are a lot of YouTube videos to show you how to max privacy setting and there must be over 25 that you have to change including the ones on oculus app and the oculus 2 headset setting. Since not using Facebook don't really see the big problem. Just think about all the crap Amazon knows about you. They know so much because you use it. Facebook has made  more privacy setting you can lock down but it sure takes a while to find them all. A lot are hidden on purpose buy you can close almost all of them. I was surprised how many i could lock down. Will probably  never even log on to Facebook again. No reason to unless they give you more privacy options to close.Quest 2 blow away Oculus go. It has the xr2 chip in it. They are loosing money at 299.00. This is the best freestanding VR you can get, no wire to expensive pc needed. Everyone should get the  RAVpower Filehub to use with this once DLNA is supported. Gives you unlimited storage capacity on your headset. Oculus 2 can then have apps stored on it while RAVpower can have everything else plus it can keep headset charged up while you use it.Would give it 5 stars if not for having to have facebook account and spending so much time changing  their privacy setting to max.XR2 chip is so nice.As of 11-22-20 after over 15 email contacts to Oculus  DLNA is now supported .  This now works  with the Ravpower Hub and is  so nice. Now that DLNA is supported and I can use my RAVpower Hub with it, along with having all setting on headset set to only me ,this is now a a Fantastic VR headset. What once I only gave a one star  I now give 4 stars. Ravpower has no issues even with 8k on its own 5g wifi network sending it to the oculus 2. You can install any portable hard drive to it and send it all via wifi to Quest 2 keeping Quest 2 drive empty to load up on apps if you like.

    Better than Quest 1, but...
  
",4.0,AP,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  The Quest 2 is better and worse than the Quest 1.Pros:- slightly higher resolution, but you can still easily see the individual pixels.  We are nowhere near a “retina” screen resolution yet.- definitely less screen door effect.  The layout of the LCD pixels actually makes a bigger difference than the actual resolution.  The pixels look much cleaner now.Cons:- lack of fine IPD adjustment.  I used 63mm on the Quest 1 and I’m using the same 63mm setting (IPD 2) on the Quest 2, but I’m seeing chromatic aberration on the sides of objects.  There’s like a rainbow outline around objects against a white background.  I think this has to do with the layout of the LCD pixels and an IPD setting that’s not my exact size.- When looking straight ahead, I can easily see the edges of the LCD screen with my peripheral vision.  This is on the IPD 2 setting.  It’s probably much worse for people who use IPD 3 setting.Quest 2 is an upgrade and a downgrade at the same time.  I wish they made a “pro” model along with this one that doesn’t make any sacrifices.  Yes, it’s important to have a $299 model to get new VR users, but also make a high end model.  I want to experience the future of VR now, even if it costs more.

    The future of gaming perhaps
  
",4.0,James D.,"Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  If you’re looking into stepping into VR gaming then this is hands down the BEST way to go about it. It’s around the same price as a Nintendo switch and definitely cheaper than the new Xbox and PlayStation (at the time of this writing). And what you get is amazing. There’s plenty of killer apps and amazing games that you should definitely try out! There’s just about everything for everyone, and the best part is that you can use a cable to connect it to a PC and play even MORE games, which is wicked cool! Battery life isn’t all great but that’s to be given, and the reliance of having a Facebook account may get a little irritating, but other than that the Quest 2 is amazing! It’s by far my new favorite platform to game on. The 64gb one is the one I own and with file sizes of games and apps, is more than enough for me. Plus, it’s priced at $299. Way better than spending thousands on a Valve Index

    Should you upgrade from Oculus 1 to Oculus 2? Check my review
  
",3.0,Linar,"Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2021","









  
  
    
  I am a VR software engineer and I had to upgrade my Oculus Quest to Oculus Quest 2.Among the many advantages of the new headset I can highlight:1) it's cheaper than the first model2) it's lighter and smaller3) has a better resolutionBut unfortunately, the model has quite a few cons and those are pretty significant:1) Unlike Oculus Quest 1, this model is relying on Facebook account, which meansa) if you get banned on Facebook for WHATEVER reason (and they can make up any these days), you loose your Oculus profile and everything on itb) your privacy is no longer that private2) No improvements to the battery life3) Although it's lighter, if you really want to make it comfortable, you have to buy the ""elite"" strap from Oculus for another 50$4) If you need to connect your Oculus to PC for whatever reason (such as using SideQuest), you will need a USB - USB-c adapter5) Controllers are battery-equipped, and although they last long, you still need to replace them from time to timeDecide for yourself, if you want to upgrade from Quest 1 to Quest 2. If you're not too concerned about the cons, I'd say ""yes"", because with the 50$ strap, this thing is really more comfortable and tech-advanced.Oh and if you're thinking whether to buy an Oculus Quest or another VR headset, I give all my votes for Oculus Quest for all of the great reasons it brings (that's gonna take another other post to explain), but most importantly it's the hand-tracking feature that allows you to put aside the controllers and simply use your hands in most VR apps and games.Welcome to the future!

  My Facebook account was disabled a few years ago when my profile picture caught the attention of an alt-right facebook group. After repeated death threats being sent to me (which facebook ignored) my account was disabled and facebook asked me to send them a picture of my photo ID to prove who I was. Apparently one of the tactics people use if they are targeting you is having a large group of people report your account to facebook and trigger a bot to disable your account. I sent my ID to them and they never fixed it, so I gave up and stopped using Facebook. Now my account is banned and I was told it can't be renewed. If I try and make a new account they ban that one too. This means I can't use this product I ordered and all my games that I linked to a new account from my quest 1 are gone too. Hundreds of dollars worth of games. Don't trust facebook and don't buy this.

  When I bought this I thought I could play any VR game.  Nope.  First of all you need a stable internet connection to go to Facebook.  Then you need an account that meets all of their changing guidelines.  Then you need their approval to have an account.  All this so I could try to play a VR game that I already own.  Would buy this again, no.  I don't use Facebook, I bought the wrong device.  Oculus got all these great reviews, but it sucks if you want to play steam pc games in VR.  You can steam your desktop to VR, but that isn't a VR game. I bought the wrong VR setup. A donkey took off it's thong wrong.

  Would be zero stars if that was an option.  Never had a facebook account and decided to create one with fake name not realizing that it was against the rules.  Immediately disabled the account.  Tried to create one using my real info and that was immediately disabled.  Sent a photo to verify account and they still won't enable it.  So now it's going back because having to have a social media account to use it is the most ridiculous thing.  I'll order the valve index and wait until they have stock.

  VR needs wider audience, but this product seems to go toward the opposite direction.Smaller face pad means people with big head will have hard time wearing it.Smaller sweet spot means you'll spending more time adjusting, and small vibration might make everything blurry again.Smaller IPD range and its horrible adjusting mechanism further deters its future customer.Controllers is bulkier and the holding pose doesn't match any real life handle.I'm really worried that it will cause similar effect Google Cardboard did: a cheap but low-quality product that destroy consumer's trust in future VR products.

  I am not a gamer but I have had a great time with this VR set .  there are lots of fun things you can do and the VR just blows me away most of the time.  The sound is fantastic and the quality of the display is amazing .  For what you get the price is fair I think I would recommend getting the more expensive one with the larger memory you will fill up the 64G one quickly if you play games.  I find most of the games a bit expensive but I don't have a good feel for what they cost on other platforms.  they seem to be from free to $40  there are a lot of lower priced ones around $10  which is not bad.  I would like to try some of them but spending $40 for a game that I probably will not be able to play or maybe even like is hard to justify.  You can return some games within 7 days so that is a nice feature.  I think it was worth the money and I enjoy the puzzle type games a lot.

The quest 2 died within a hour of being fully charged. Then both controllers randomly disconnected and will not re-connect. Then the Quest 2 went to a black screen and will not show display. I tried resetting to factory settings. Uninstalling all files, re-installing app and followed multiple online tutorials and videos and I can not get this to work. I keep seeing these same complaints over and over. This has wasted too much of my time and money!!

    GREAT HEADSET AMAZING PRICE
  
",5.0,Wilfredo,"Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2020","This headset is great. Is lightweight. Is comfortable it allows you to run any kind of VR experience, exercise and enjoy games, videos, experiences and explore like you never had before. This beats any console like Playstation or Xbox. You buy this headset and you need nothing else.

PROs:

-(WIRELESS)
Needs no cable connected to anything but has the option to connect the cable if you want to play more graphically rich or intense games.

- (COMFORT)
It is far more comfortable that is predecessor. Is great for both child and adult content.

-(EXPERIENCES)
If you are not looking for games and are interested in exploring watching videos and seeing something knew. Get this! The experiences are amazing.

-(GAMES)
The are tons of great games. If you like Shooters get Onward or Pavlov. If you like fitness get CREED or Thrill of the Fight. If you want Battle Royal Population ONE. There is a ton of great content in the library.

-(FITNESS)
Some games are a full workout but even the ones that are not will keep you active which is far better than any other console experience where you are not using your body. Good games are CREED Multiplayer fitness and thrill of the fight.

-(FRIENDS AND FAMILY)
Connect in this virtual experiences with other friends and family even if they don't have a VR headset you can show it to them and pass it around for fun for everyone. If they have a VR headset too then even better you can interact with them while being distant and connect like is not possible in traditional videogames or even videocalls.

-(PORTABILITY)
This is a stand alone headset kind of like a phone, it is small, light and easy to put on. You can take it on the road with you.

CONs:

- (FACEBOOK ACCOUNT REQUIRED)
This means you have to make a facebook account even if you not planning on posting anything or using it at all. Your profile will not be shared publicly unless you choose to. This wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't because Facebook has a garbage Term of Services that lets them ban your account for dumb things like using an Alias or having multiple accounts or sometimes for no apparent reason.

-(STRAP)
You have to get the 50$ strap is way better than the original one and is totally worth it. But even the 50$ strap could be far more comfortable. They need to put more work into the straps.

-(WEIGHT)
They reduced the weight but they need to reduce it further or have the option to remove the battery. When you walk outside the Boundaries it goes black fairly quickly this is not helpful if you want to pause to get water without taking off the headset.",Hardware Platform: Oculus Quest 2 - 64 GB

  Long story short:|Pros|* Very cool experience but when you get used to it it’s just ok. The main reason is that most of the 360 Videos and games are VERY old and basic.|Cons|* Facebook required. If you don’t want to use your own, open another account. You will be blocked eventually.* Very heavy and it hurts after a while.* Battery life is very short, about two hours but you can’t hold this long with such a heavy setup on your face anyway.* Eyes will hurt after a while, the lenses are super close to your eyes.* The strap is junk and this is one of the reasons it’s so uncomfortable. But they sell a good strap of course for additional 50$.* Most of the videos are old from 2017... nothing new is made anymore. I don’t know why... but this makes me think about the future of this platform.* Very limited games library, again not much content made for this platform. Just search YT for good games and you will see that everyone is doing the same games.* Everything cost you money. You need to buy EVERYTHING and always. There is only one free game that is kinda cool but that’s it. You buy games and then you pay for additional options in the game.It’s not there yet..

    The VR deal of the decade
  
",5.0,Rarely_review_anything,"Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have been into VR gaming for years now. I started with an HTC Vive back in late 2016, and never looked back. At that time, the PC VR gaming experience (both the HTC and Oculus offerings) had finally become everything that gamers had been promised since the 90’s with “The Lawnmower Man” and Nintendo’s ill-fated Virtual Boy. Although I have long preferred the HTC tracking system and hardware builds, both companies offered an experience unlike anything before them.When the time came to upgrade from my HTC Vive, I purchased a Vive Pro, and was even happier than expected with the improvements over the original. I had an almost perfect VR gaming setup, with two exceptions: price, and the fact that I was tethered to a computer with a large wire.For anyone who hasn’t experienced wired VR gaming, I promise it’s more limiting than you’d expect, especially when playing games like “Thrill of the Fight” (a must have for VR exercise) or “Pavlov.” Price is pretty self explanatory, but I will mention for the sake of comparison that I had over $3500 invested in my first two VR setups, including both headsets, the gaming PC, and peripherals.Now on to why the Oculus Quest 2 is so amazing. Aside from graphical fidelity, Oculus (aka Facebook VR) is now offering a setup that is better than the original HTC Vive setup that I had in 2016, for $300! I purchased this on release day because my Vive Pro is currently out of service due to a sensor failure, and I still need a wireless adapter to “untether” my experience. When calculating the cost of a replacement sensor and the wireless adapter, those two components ALONE cost more than the Quest 2’s entire setup. AND this setup is wireless out of the box, doesn’t require me to mount sensors on my wall, and doesn’t require constant tuning/troubleshooting of my gaming PC to ensure the best experience. You open the box, put it on, and it just works. And you never again have to worry about getting tangled up in wires.After giving this glowing review, I will admit that you will never get the graphical quality from this headset that you will get from a Vive Pro/Valve Index + a good gaming PC, but for almost all of the games that I play, the experience is better on the Quest 2 simply because of the wireless aspect. If I want to play Half Life Alyx, or any other game with incredible graphics, I’ll need to go back to the Vive, but for my daily “VR workouts,” I’ll stick with the Quest 2 and Beat Saber/Thrill of the Fight.If you are looking for your first VR headset, you’ve found it. Even if you already have a gaming PC, I would still recommend the Quest 2 and an Oculus Link cable instead of a PC based VR setup.Facebook is currently selling these at a loss to introduce VR to a new audience, and to pull hardcore Steam/Valve/HTC fans like myself into the Oculus ecosystem, and they’re doing a great job. But take advantage now, because they may not ever sell hardware this good at a price this low again.

    Initial impressions: Blown away.
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  WOW. That's my reaction to my first few hours with the Oculus Quest 2. I intend to update this review as I spend more time with the device, but here's my preliminary review:Setup: Super easy. Out of the box you have the headset, 2 controllers, a glasses spacer, and a charging cord & adapter. That's it. The controllers run on a single AA battery each, so you pull a little tab to turn those on then turn on the headset. The headset then walks you through setup and a quick update. You NEED to use the Oculus app on your phone at this point so if you don't have an Oculus app and account setup, you'll be prompted. I was up and running and updated in about 10 minutes, and the battery was at 59% out of the box.The final step of setup has you draw a ""guardian"" boundary around you, which is intended to keep you from knocking into furniture and obstructions in your room. It has an option for standing as well as sitting which is a really nice feature, as a big grid will pop up and block your view if you stray close to the line.And then you're off to VR experiences!Screen: The clarity is very impressive. I have only ever experienced PlayStation VR, but this is considerably better looking. Text is really crisp and colors look great. Everything looks clear and smooth. If it looks blurry to you, you may need to adjust the headset up/down/left/right on your face and try the 3 different lens spacing options to get the best clarity.Sound: The headset has speakers built into it, which sound surprisingly good. I played a few levels of Beat Saber and it actually wasn't bad. Kinda like watching a video on your phone's speakers... good enough, but not going to blow you away. There is a 3.5mm headphone jack which you'll want to use for the best sound quality and immersion.Fit/Comfort: The headset has a foam cushion that presses against your forehead and cheeks. It is relatively comfortable but not as good as the PlayStation VR version, particularly because the foam gets damp if you sweat, while the PSVR has more of a rubbery material that wipes off. The straps holding the headset on are fabric and velcro which I was worried about at first, but you can actually get a pretty solid fit after some adjusting. The only downside here is that it won't be as simple to switch back and forth between other players. The headset does start to weigh on your face after extended periods of time but that's the nature of the beast with VR.Gameplay/tracking: This device requires no external sensors and instead tracks the controllers with cameras and accelerometers/gyroscopes. I am very impressed by the tracking. Beat Saber is a good tracking test as it requires really quick movements all over in front of your body and it never lost tracking that I noticed.Controllers: If you're new to VR, you get a controller for each hand with a few buttons and a joystick. Like an advanced Wii-mote or an Xbox controller cut in half with a plastic ring on top. The button layout is intuitive and comfortable, everything is easily within reach. I'm actually a fan of these running on AA batteries as that means no downtime for charging as long as you have extras laying around. I had a few times I wanted to play PSVR and had to wait for controllers to charge.Overall: I believe this device is VR's best shot to become mainstream. You can use it anywhere (indoors), with no wires and no PC or PlayStation required. It just works. It is relatively affordable and the library of VR experiences is steadily growing and already includes some amazing options. I am excited to see what the next few years of VR is like now that developers have this high performance standalone device in their hands.Disclaimer: You NEED a Facebook account for this device. If you're not a fan of Facebook, you'll need to look elsewhere.

  I’m trying to write an unbiased review for this item. So the consular has nice features such as specifying the game play area and giving you warning if you were about to move outside it, user friendly and ergonomic controllers, high resolution of the display, etc.However, the games are not so high quality, which is somewhat expectable given the limited processing capability of the headset. I would say the games would be fun for teenager but as an adult, I didn’t enjoy it at all. Graphic of the games are so simple, simpler than games on your smart phone. Research this and watch some YouTube videos before ordering.

    The first good entry point in VR for non-tech-enthusiasts.
  
",2.0,Artyom,"Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2021","









  
  
    
  It's a great piece of standalone hardware that can be enjoyed without wires, without an extremely high-end gaming PC (or better yet, with!), and is extremely affordable for what it offers.That said, while I'd like to talk more about everything it gets right, there's some real drawbacks that I need to make some noise about.1. A Facebook profile is mandatory. Everyone knows this by now, but I'm still bringing it up. I already had an account I'd previously deactivated, because I was tired of falling into the skinnerbox loop that had me closing FB in boredom and immediately re-opening it out of habit.While the hiatus was healthy, having over $100 of Quest games tied directly to my FB's account integrity means that I basically wouldn't feel safe posting ever again if I wanted to. Yesterday I got an automated 30 day post block for a meme I posted in 2018, and it's not even close to violating the stated community standards, but I'm not important (or, I quote, ""dangerous"") enough to get a chance to appeal it to a human employee... unless I want to go through a 3rd party company that front-loads the fact that I'm probably not even going to get my case reviewed.In short, participation in Facebook is demanded, and in practical terms, so is being absolutely silent while they curate which propaganda is going to be shoved in my face when I log in to keep my profile buoyant, because they're holding a whole lot of paid-for software hostage and are contractually allowed to pull the trigger if they (or a robot that can't detect nuance, irony or sarcasm) decide I'm not sticking closely enough to their script. Cool!2. Speaking of triggers, my right trigger squeaks. Loudly, and permanently. It's received a ton of breaking-in, and still, the only thing that silences it is flooding the housing with plastic-safe electric wash, and after a few days it always comes right back. On the entire Quest 2 system, the right trigger is by FAR the physical input you'll use the most, and fresh out of the box, I had this cheap bedspring-sounding squeak pulling me out of any attempt to get immersed. I only found a fix after doing my own research (because they're not going to acknowledge a hardware fault unless you go after them about it), dodging a lot of bad advice (like using WD40), and further research clarified that people who have this issue were having a miserable time getting an official fix... so I guess I'm feeding my touch controller electric wash indefinitely, the way a car uses gas. That's an unanticipated cost for sure.3. The unit's bootup stage is becoming increasingly unpredictable, and it seems to get worse with every update. You'll usually hear the startup chime and get the Oculus logo, but about a quarter of the time now, I'm greeted with a black screen and refusal of all additional input from the power button; you can't force a restart to let it try again, it'll just hang there in limbo for sometimes over a minute just deciding what it wants to do. Other times it'll report that tracking was lost and the prompt will just sit there and stare at you for 30seconds before it lets you set up a guardian. For a device that's clearly intended to be picked up and played for quick sessions, this really sucks, and standing around blindfolded in silence while a computer ignores you is probably the fastest way to start questioning your life choices.Overall, the Quest 2 is a praiseworthy device, but it comes with enormous caveats that you're unlikely to be warned about amidst all the hype.

    Impressive intro to VR with ability to play PC games as well
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this on a whim to play around with VR.  I'm very impressed with what Occulus has built for only $300. The wireless and no PC required experience is really quite good given you're basically running on cell phone level components.  I've only played a couple games but have already gotten my money worth in enjoyment just from those games.  I encourage owners to try Echo VR (free) and Population One (not free).  Additionally you can use a link cable and get some games for your PC (recommend Half-Live Alyx).  The controllers track really well, I have no complaints about the controllers and battery lift off of just AA batteries is really remarkable.  The goggles can be a bit blurry to me and I can sometimes hear the fan or gyro noise coming from them while playing but it doesn't distract from the experience.  I find the headset comfortable with the included strap, perhaps I will try some 3rd party upgrades down the road but right now I don't see the need.  VR has come a long way in a few years and at this price point it's worth playing around with even if you just end up playing a few games with it.

    This thing can do a lot. Exceeded my expectations, even after looking at many reviews.
  
",5.0,E. Schmucker,"Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2020","I'm giving this five stars because of the price, even though there are some slightly annoying things. It can take a bit of work positioning it on your face to get it as clear as possible. The face pad absorbs sweat, and since I'm using it mostly for exercise, I need to buy something like a silicone cover or a more easily washable replacement pad. Unfortunately, there are no-brand Chinese options, which I don't trust on my face, and most everything else is out of stock. It should include a good silicone cover in my opinion.

Compared to the model I tried a few years ago, the pixels are barely visible, and overall the clarity is good. The view isn't very wide, but again - price. I was going to return mine because it looks like there is something on the inside of the lens or something, but I read that this is from light reflecting around inside and off your eyes. It comes and goes, so it may be just reflections that change with the content. I wish I could compare it to another to know if mine has an issue.

I'm amazed how powerful the processor is - haven't experienced any stuttering of any operation. Streaming a virtual desktop from one computer to the headset (using Virtual Desktop app) and then casting to another computer worked great.

Most people probably know a little about what these things can do. But it takes a while to get the complete picture. The details can get confusing, and we're still learning. For example, I bought a link cable because a YouTuber said it allows you to play PC games and see the PC desktop. But there is a wireless option (uses WiFi), the Virtual Desktop app, that cost about $30. The cable didn't work anyway, so I returned it. The company that makes the Virtual Desktop app has an accompanying desktop app that does the streaming. That let's you see the PC desktop in various settings, but you need to install the large Oculus Desktop application to play PC games with the headset. But none of our computers have a graphics card that is powerful enough. You need a beefy computer to play PC games on the Quest 2.

But you don't need a computer at all to use the Quest 2. There are a ton of games that play natively on the Quest 2 that you download from the Oculus Quest app store. The computer inside is powerful enough to support decent games. There won't be the visual detail of a PlayStation, Xbox, or PC games, but that doesn't detract from the potential fun factor.

My son is currently experimenting with Sidequest, which is a desktop program that makes it easy to ""sideload"" applications, separate from the Oculus app store. There doesn't seem to be anything wrong with doing that, and provides a bunch of extra applications and capabilities.

My 80+ year old dad asked ""what do these things do for you?"". I'll try and do my best to explain. If you are going to purchase one and want to discover things for yourself, then don't read further. What follows is more for people who aren't very familiar with these VR headsets.

The headset has two displays so each eye can see a different image, allowing it to simulate depth perception. This is a big deal. Even though the display isn't as clear as a nice monitor, the headset makes you feel like you are really ""there"" - more on what ""there"" can be later. I live near mountains and find that a picture doesn't ever allow a viewer to get the feel of the scale and magnitude of the view you experience when standing there. I think this is because as you stand there and look around, your mind forms a detailed internal model of the mountains as you move your gaze around. When you look at a picture, the depth is hard to ""see"" - you have to infer distance intellectually, not automatically. And even if you could pan a picture back and forth on a computer screen, for some reason you just don't get the same impression. The difference is dramatic to me. So when you are looking through the headset at a 3D scene, your brain accepts that you really there.

The headset has cameras in the four front corners that track your head movements, and the position and orientation of the controllers you hold in each hand. So when you turn or move your head, the view of the virtual world moves very precisely and close to what would happen in the real world. This can really help avoid feeling of nausea. I personally get a little sick if I play a 3D game on Xbox for a long time. When you pan your view left and right, the mismatch between what your eyes see, and the inner ear signals reaching your brain cause nausea. Once it sets in, it can last for hours. So having the headset move the virtual world to match your head movements, when standing still and looking around, is way better. This only applies when standing still. The opposite is true when you move in virtual space. Some 3D movies move you through virtual space, or a game may allow you to push the joystick to move around. I find that this makes me feel sick immediately. If the app has an option to ""teleport"" instantaneously to another point in space, then it doesn't make me sick. The quick transition is handled better by our brains. Some games have options to mitigate these effects using blinders, motion blur, or vignette effects when moving. This limits what you see when moving, so you can kind of see what is happening, but your brain isn't getting overloaded by it.

Besides tracking your head movements, the cameras track the position and orientation of the hand controllers. This allows you to precisely point to things in VR, or interact with VR in other ways. There's a demo application that lets you pick up a virtual paper airplane and throw it. The airplane and other objects appears right in front of you on a desk. You reach out and position your hand over the object and pull both triggers to simulate gripping the object. To make it less annoying, it doesn't matter where you grip the airplane - it orients automatically. You perform a throwing motion and release the triggers at the right time. There is a ball on a string that you can punch, like tether-ball. I mention these only as examples. It's completely up to the application how hand motions translate to VR actions. A soccer app could make your hand movements affect the player's feet, because the headset can't track what your feet do. But most apps require hand actions, and the game mimics your real life motions in VR, which is very intuitive.

The Quest has the ability to track your hand positions without having to hold the controllers. It does a great job of seeing your hand and finger positions. But it is limited in some ways. If you touch your hands together, it can't tell what it is seeing and your hands disappear in VR. And it isn't as precise as tracking the controllers, so if an app requires precise pointing, for example, you'll have to use the controllers.

Given that the device can display any virtual ""world"" or space, and each controller has two triggers, two buttons, and a joystick, the possibilities of what these things can do is huge. They've been around for a few years, but they aren't mainstream just yet. The Oculus Quest 2 is selling well and the future looks bright.

When you first turn it on, complete set-up, and log into your Facebook account (required), you'll see a couple of virtual flat panels with icons. Just like any operating system, the look of the interface will change over time. The controllers emit a virtual pointer that extends a few feet in virtual space, and the exact spot they are pointing to is shown with a small white dot. You click the main front trigger to select the option you are currently pointing to. You can open the app store, a browser, the ""TV"" app, settings, etc. Of course you can open an app that you've downloaded and installed.

There are a ton of options. Here are some examples. You can install the Netflix app and watch content while sitting in a virtual rustic lodge, with a big screen surrounded by stonework. There are many other options for viewing 3D video content. These let you fly over mountains, or view ants up close doing their thing, and everything in-between. You can browse any web site. Some web sites contain 3D apps that you run by clicking the little headset icon (typically) to jump into 3D mode. There are educational apps - I saw one where ""you"" are in an artery and can reach out and examine white and red blood cells. You can view concerts or other entertainment, like comedians, very ""close up"". There are social apps where you can visit with other people in various virtual environments. There are virtual games like paintball. I found that games that allow you to shoot arrows are really cool - you bring the controllers up and together, pull one trigger to grab the string, and then pull a controller back from the other to draw the bow. Letting the trigger go lets the arrow fly. You can shoot surprisingly accurately. There are apps to create artwork and 3D models. Who knows what people will dream up?

When I first started using this device, I found myself sometimes stuck, not knowing how to exit the app. In general once you figure this stuff out, most apps honor the common conventions, but some do their own thing and you have to experiment.

There are options to record a movie of what you are seeing and doing, or take a screenshot.

Personally, I'm using the FitXR exercise app the most. FitXR is a punching and dancing workout app. My legs and arms are tired from punching at balls and ducking under beams that come at you. So far, I haven't felt any tedium exercising this way. You have to focus and keep moving and you just lose yourself. There are a number of these types of games, Beat Saber being very popular, but I think they can be much better and more diverse. Some more advanced exercise apps require a monthly fee.

Some games require you to move around a little. To keep you from running into walls or furniture, the Quest has two ways to define your movement boundaries. Once defined, when you get close to an edge, a virtual mesh wall gradually appears, and disappears when you move away from the edge. If you move outside the boundary, it goes into pass-through mode where the game stops and you can see your room through the external cameras. You can either define a small circular boundary right where you sit or stand, or you can draw a boundary of any shape to match your room obstacles. In the second case, it shows your real space through the cameras and you draw the boundary line on the floor by pointing and drawing with a controller. Very slick. At first, it was hard to trust, but as saw how well it works, I don't worry anymore. Even when I go to a different floor to get a drink or something, and come back, the boundary is still defined perfectly, and I can continue the game.

I hope this helps some decide if the Quest 2 is for them.",Hardware Platform: Oculus Quest 2 - 64 GB

  I am a supreme novice on VR but am so impressed. Learning new things to do everyday that I use it. I am definitely outside of the target market area but this is great. Have purchased a few apps and acquired several of the free ones that come from Oculus. Be ready for motion issues especially when you are up in the International Space Station. Keep telling yourself it's only a game when you have a T-Rex roaring two feet in front of your face. The one drawback I have found is a challenge to find directions or explanation of game icons (at least to me). The app Wander is an example. There are icons but I am not sure I know what to do with them. I will eventually figure it out but a little frustrating.

  It really pains me to say it, but this is a good buy.  I've been waiting to fully get onto the VR bandwagon, and this finally made it affordable and enticing enough for me to do so.  I've heard of a lot of weird situations happening where people's accounts are getting banned simply for merging their Oculus account into it... From what I understand, a lot of their accounts are being reinstated.  Think about it... Facebook WANTS you to use the product.  They WANT you to be buying things from the store, and allowing them to harvest your sweet sweet data.  I have confidence that before long, everyone will have access again.Now, onto the specifics.-This is first and foremost a standalone system, which is great.  The ability to play in any room of the house without bothering other people is huge.  The native software catalog isn't huge yet, but I'm sure that it'll continue to expand.-You can get a HELL of a workout with this thing.  I'm at a point in my life where I would rather have bamboo chutes jammed under my fingernails than walk on the treadmill, so making exercise fun again was a godsend.  I feel better and better every day, and I'm losing weight.  I tell people: remember how when you were a little kid, you would run around on the playground all day?  It wasn't necessarily that you had killer cardio, its that you were having so much fun that you didn't even care that you felt like your lungs were on fire.  That's how this is.  Notable games for this: ""Beat Saber"" and ""Pistol Whip"".-For PC gaming, this isn't completely there yet.  The Oculus Link is still in beta, and the only other option is an app called ""Virtual Desktop"" which allows you to pair your device to your PC over WiFi.  I have a top-of-the-line gaming PC and 5GHz WiFi router... neither of these options are spectacular yet.  With Oculus Link, the positions of the controllers seems to stutter and lag occasionally.  It doesn't make anything unplayable, but it is just enough to throw off your groove in a rhythm game.  With Virtual Desktop, I consistently have issues where the virtual world's rendering seems to lag behind my head movement; whipping my head to the side leaves me briefly looking into a black screen until the PC/WiFi catch up and show me what is actually supposed to be there.Overall, I'm extremely happy with this purchase.  It fits perfectly with my lifestyle, and it makes me FEEL BETTER.

  BAD setup!! The set up seems easy it walks you through each step and you think you are all ready to go BUT then you try to purchase a game it tells you to enter your PIN. There was never a prompt to set up a PIN while setting up your account( done by syncing with your Facebook). In the app has a place to reset your PIN but since you never set up a pin the you can’t change it because you have to know the previous PIN. So anyone thinking about getting this for your kids for Christmas make sure you set it up because Customer Service takes one to two business days to get back to you if you send them a support request.

  I had the original Rift for 2+ years.  This is such a huge upgrade over the original.  Better screen and of course, wireless.  Not having wires is such a big difference in VR.  I would compare it to living in a house with and without air conditioning.  It makes the VR so much more immersive, and the better screen is the cherry on the top.  The original Rift had very grainy screen, you can easily see the pixels.  The Quest 2 screen is so much more clear, I cant see the pixels.  So, the experience is a huge upgrade.  But not everythign is perfect.  The battery life is only about 1.5 hours with heavy usage.  A lot of the games on the Rift are not cross-buy, so you have to buy them again for the Quest.  Yeah, I could hook up a cable to my pc and play Rift games, but that would defeat the purpose of it being wireless.

    Best VR headset I have ever owned!!
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  Okay, full disclaimer it is the only VR headset I have ever owned. That being said it was a great birthday present to myself and I love every minute I use it.Okay so for the bad things about it. The head strap is horrible, very uncomfortable and I find myself rearranging it very often. And the elite head strap is rather costly at the moment. There is limited content at the moment which kind of sucks. You have different things such as Venues which is in beta that has some good potential but falls flat at times. But maybe soon we will have some cool things VR dating sites especially with current events. And more games, imagine top games like an actual VR COD or GTA. And what about games like Among us but in full VR mode. And maybe some VR vacations where we can go to actual places and walk the streets and go into the stores on our own and not some video tour we watch. And maybe with movie theaters going away we can watch more VR160 formatted Hollywood hits. Like I said the potential is limitless and maybe in a few years it will be huge.Another thing I do not care of is the fact that you can not use Bluetooth headsets unless you do some technical stuff that takes some know how and work. Instead it uses a standard headphone jack, so not cool. But the built in speaker system is very good.And it doesn't charge very fast while plugged in and using it. So you battery will still drain just not as fast and it wont fully recharge if you are using it. At least that has been my experience. But the battery does last several hours so it is good and it doesn't take long to fully recharge when it is off.The last thing I hate and a lot of people say it, sometimes it isn't very clear. There is some video that comes out blurry and you have to adjust the headset to get a clearer picture. But honestly for the most part everything else is clear so it isn't that big of a deal.Now the positives.It is just so darn fun!!! Plus a lot of the games are good for getting that exercise and movement. So if you have a kid who loves games but doesn't like to go outside and move around get him one of these, set up the parental controls and watch them get healthy.Also with the cast feature you can actually see what the kids are doing on the the VR headset right on your cellphone with the Oculus app.Plus you can surf the web, watch youtube, movies, amazon prime and Netflix on this headset so you can lay in bed watch a movie in all sort of settings. And the screens look huge so it is like having a 100 foot television.While there is limited content currently you can still do a lot from watching movies, to seeing concerts and chatting with people all over the world. So it isn't just playing games. Plus the learning capabilities are endless in the VR world. One day we can use it to go to school and get degrees. Learn hands on skills without having to leave our homes.Overall, this VR headset is amazing and a very worthwhile investment. Best money I ever spent on myself!!!

  10/20/20I had the original Quest just prior to this. The Quest 2 has better hardware but the fit and feel are a large step backwards (and I assume why the price is so low in addition to the burden of mandated Facebook where they'll no doubt monetize your info).The Quest 2 strap SUCKS compared to original Quest headstrap. The lenses have only 3 positions so pray your face is perfectly one of them (mine isn't) - the original Quest had a slider so more ability to fine tune. I was hoping for another slider with more range (my sight was best at the extreme end of the slider on original Quest - you may have to use aftermarket silicone or foam seal to fit you to one of the 3 lens settings).Most games aren't optimized yet to really see much of a difference graphically so if you have the old Quest there's no rush.It didn't save my game progress when I switched over from Quest to Quest 2 - not sure what I was supposed to do or even if it's a possibility so look that up ahead of time.I did get screwed with buying games inbetween headsets (there were several weeks from when I sold original to when I received pre-order). I didn't like one of the half a dozen or so games and requested a refund immediately after I was able to download and play. I was told I was outside the 14 day window (despite me explaining the situation that I had no way to play it).The base model should have 128gb - these tech companies rip us off constantly on memory. MEMORY IS NOT THAT EXPENSIVE.If you want to be generous, you can say that by the time you buy an after market headstrap and seal you will have spent the same amount as you would have on the old headset (which retailed for more than the Quest 2 64gb price) but you have the benefit of better hardware.

  So I’m in the ring of thrill of the fight fighting ugly Joe kid. I accidentally hit the oculus button and find myself back in my lobby. I leave and get back into the fight but I don’t have a left boxing glove? What’s up? Anyway I’m in the 11th round and I’m going to finish this fight so I continue on and win. Just bragging. I come out back into the gym and there’s my boxing glove on the floor except I can’t pick it up. My right controller completely will not pair with the oculus anymore. I go online and this is a common issue. I try the tinfoil solution this works for about 10 minutes then again right controller won’t work. I do all the suggested things. I remove the battery for a minute to let it reset. I remove the battery for the day to let it reset. I unfair and repair an unfair and repair and unfair and repair. Nothing. It’s dead. Lucky for me I bought this in November and it’s still under Amazon‘s return policy on January 31, 2021. I contacts oculus support then they told me to do the same thing that everybody online told me to do. Don’t get me wrong, I love the freaking thing. I enjoy it immensely it is absolutely great for workouts I have FixXRThrill of the fight, and even pistol whip is apretty good work out. But I’m gonna wait until they address the problem before I buy another one.

  Nope...It was totally unnecessary & ridiculous being forced to link with Facebook. Intrusion of private information even when adjusting privacy settings. A total shame too because it is an amazing VR headset. There's enough information about this item by performing an online search that throws up multiple red flags. As long as Facebook enforces these policies I cannot recommend this headset and suggest looking for a different product.

   This is coming from a new VR user the last time I used VR was when I was using my Gear VR.  The oculus quest 2 is so easy to set up.  All you have to do is put on the headset and follow the instructions.  The only thing I have to complain about which I will not take off any stars for it is the head strap.  I'll probably end up ordering the head strap that is for the oculus quest 2.  Other than that this thing blows me away I would highly recommend purchasing one of these for Other than that this thing blows me away I would highly recommend purchasing one of these for yourself.

  After having it for 2 days I have begun to see malfunctioning. Right now it is at the point where it does not work out at all. You cannot play any of your games pretty much if you do not have a boundary and in order to have one, your ""tracking"" needs to be working. After spending a lot of time researching and watching videos I noticed others have had this problem. However, they were able to fix it by restarting. This is not the case for me. I have almost spent $100 on games to not be able to play with them because my quest 2 console doesn't work. I reached out to customer service to exchange it for another one but no response yet.

  I've only had my Quest 2 for two weeks and I'm already loving it. I'll try to make a shorter review without missing essential points.-The quest has very nice quality display, with barely, if any screen door effect.-You're really getting a great package here. The box alone can be used to store the quest until you get a good case-The controllers come preloaded with batteries, all you have to do is remove the contact tabs.-A nice hard copy manual and health +safety guide are includedThe major difference between the quest and PC VR is the Quest is a little more limited in hardware specs.With that said, it's a big step up from the original, and there's some amazing games on this thing that will keep you going for hours.I can't say enough good about the crazy amount of enjoyment I've gotten out of the games on Quest so far.

  Awesome, but it wears off quickly, at least for me, and I’m a 73 year old grandma’. Why? Because, unless you play games, there aren’t that many options. Almost every 360 clip on YT is less than a  five min experience, unless you decide you want to see other cities on foot, but then motion sickness sets in. It’s awesome that it feels like you are really there, pounding the sidewalks among strangers that you try hard not to stare at, out of politeness, but I personally got very sick during my walk through London, and it was enough to not wanting to walk anywhere again, so, no walks, and no games. Still, I liked this 64 MB Oculus thing so much that I didn’t want to give up my VR adventures, and so I began to choose those activities that had limited motion like standing on the deck of the starship Enterprise, watching elephants up close, flying at warp speed through a wormhole by the Trappist system in space and visiting the holy Land. I swam with the sharks underwater and I walked, slowly, on the China glass bridge. It was all fun, but it eventually wore off. Also, I suspect that the motion sickness may also be caused by the graphics, which aren’t always great and could stand improvement. All in all, I saw myself using the Oculuss less every day, and I was sorry, because such great potential, and very few options available, unless you are a child and like silly stuff, which I call trash, of which there is a lot. For instance, virtually all the games, and I checked, have you holding a weapon of some sort because you either hunt... others, or are hunted. Little wonder our society is so violent. So anyway, yeah, it’s fun, exciting, makes a great gift but perhaps there should be more organized entertainment available for non- violent oriented individuals, perhaps skills-teaching, tutoring, quality and realistic experiences that last more that a minute or two.

The pass through feature is amazing when setting up boundaries, the motion controllers are fluid and react great.So i guess ill be tearing down my oculus rift sensors , packing away the rift and selling it because this paired with a oculus link wire does the job and i can play it through the pc and portable.Beatsaber is fluid, Pistol Whip plays very well, i cant wait to load up walking dead saints and sinners on it, it is going to be great!

    A stupid amount of fun
  
",5.0,bradams115,"Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  I gotta admit I was completely dumbfounded by how far VR has come.  I held off on getting one but my buddy talked me into trying his and I was hooked.  While most games the graphics are not all that impressive, we are talking borderline Original Xbox to maybe Xbox360 level graphics, the overall game play is impressive.  The sensors are stupid accurate for the controllers along with headset.  The ""guardian"" system they use to keep you from running into things and setting your boundaries works extremely well.  The speakers are surprisingly awesome for being pretty far from your ears, you would never know it by the rich full sound they make.A couple small complaints though.  1st being the battery is pretty crappy.  I get about 3hrs of game time before it needs to be recharged, which by myself 3hrs would be fine but with 2 kids who want to play it too I find the battery is dead alot, thankfully it charges fairly quickly though. About 45 minutes to an hour.My other gripe is the lenses. 1) they are super easy to smudge, god forbid it touches your forehead when putting it on other wise you will have one blurry eye. It can also be a challange to adjust the headset so the picture is clear, at least for me.  I find i have to find the proper eye width setting then have the head strap super tight for the view to be clear.My last gripe is a software issue with their party chat, that needs some work for sure.  Their chat system is often overriden by games so its its difficult to maintain connectivity to your friends, its like the system wants to force you to interact with strangers and not just your friends.With all that said, yes I would recommend this to others, its just to much fun to not recommend.  Their first person shooter games are a blast but if you want a true mind blowing experience play Google Tilt Brush, you feel like freaking Tony Stark, even my wife who doesn't like games was blown away by that.

  I would like to be able to comment on the merits of the headset's performance/design in terms of comfort, audio/video quality, refresh rate, latency, etc...but since I got locked out of my Oculus account when I tried to activate the Quest 2, it has been completely unusable, so I have no idea how good or bad the Quest 2 is.The best part is that this also locked me out of my Oculus Rift and Oculus Quest (1st Generation) at the same time.  So now I have 3 headsets (technically 4, since I bought two Quest 2s) that are completely useless.  No account = No VR.  Customer service has been unresponsive.

  I was looking for a ""fun"" fitness alternative and something that would get me up and moving. The quest 2 fits the bill perfectly. Yes, you need a real Facebook account to use it, but since I've been a Facebook and smart phone user for over a decade I figure they already have all my info so it doesnt bother me. I got this primarily for fitness and play Beat Saber and Fit XR, both of which give a decent cardio workout. When I use it with my Bluetooth earbuds it's a fully immersive experience. Some people may find they get a little queasy the first couple times using. My suggestion is to ease into longer use and don't over do it and you'll adjust to the vr environment without feeling ill. Would definitely recommend as a way to be more active while having fun.

Merging my FB and Oculus accounts straight up broke my Oculus PC app making my quest 2 essentially a brick and nobody seems to know what to do about it. after submitting several tickets and waiting ""3-5 business days"" I've gotten no help and even ignored by Oculus support. So despite the fact ol Mark Zuckyboy lied to all of us about not forcing quest users to make a FB account but he also singlehandedly removed all the excitement for VR that I had.

  This could be the best product I ever purchased. I am amazed how much Oculus squeezed into one device.

The only “negative” is you need to set it up with a Facebook account, but after that you never need to go on the Facebook app. So what they track your every move, who doesn’t these days?  For $299 I dare you to find a better way to spend your hard earned cash. One caveat, buy the Halo strap ( on Amazon) and throw away the cheap head strap that comes with the unit. Other than that you need nothing else.  Check out the TRIPP app for all your meditation needs.

First impression review

My background with VR is me coming from mid tier phone VR, Oculus Rift S, then finally the oculus quest 2. I was find with the Rift S performance but I eventually got sick of the wired experience and internal stereo experience.

My first impression on this was overall decently pleasant. I feel they cheaped out on the box packaging compared to the Rift S, but I am fine with the sacrifice for the decrease in price. Everything comes with a set of instructions although not as in depth as I hoped it to be, a short charging cable with a 2A plug in charger,2 controllers with Mitsubishi batteries, and a stretchy strap.

-----

Build quality:
I feel the build quality feels really good. It definitely feels smaller in size but heavier than the Rift S. IMO that gives me a good feel like this little thing is packed with a lot of tech inside it. In terms of color I had the impression of this being a marble white color, but in fact is a slight shade of gray with a matte bumpy texture that feels like it is resistance to scuffs compared to the Rift S. The controls however is matte at a grayish white with a smooth texture.

The only thing I don't like about this is the speaker arms feels like that is the first thing to break off if you are not careful or the first thing to wear down. You can pivot the arms up and down for your comfort in conjunction to where the strap rests on your head.

-----

Controllers:
The controllers are slightly bigger and is said to have improved battery utilization from Quest 1. I find it big for my liking but it works fine. No complains. I have no issues with the performance and hand design of it after hours of use. Hand tracking is available for this if you don't want to use your controllers on home screen. Though some games supports it.

-----

Speaker:
The speaker blows the Rift S and previous headsets I have owned out the water. The speakers are located in the inner side of the headset arms. The first time I put this on, I was hit with surround sounds and good bass that I feel like I am actually in the game. I really don't feel like I need headphones to improve my experience but that is always an option. I have played with the quest 1 for a fair bit and I feel like it is the same, if not better. There is also a earphone jack which thankfully they kept.

-----

Battery:
The battery life is just okay. The headset lasts about 2 hours for me which is good enough for each sessions and prompts you for a break from the VR world. I have probably nearly drained it for cycles and my controllers are still full. Facebook did mentioned that they improved the controller batteries so that could be the result. I still have my rechargeable batteries for my Rift S, I will have to see once my stock battery drains out and use that to see if there are any changes.

There is experimental modes where you can turn on 90Hz but that will most likey decrease your standard battery time below 2 hours. Since the battery is big enough to only provide 2 hours, expect this to get worse over time due to degradation and they do not sell replacement battery for it.

Tracking:
I feel the tracking is pretty good. I have no issues so far. Latency is more or less the same from the Rift S and can play fast paced games just time. I have I have yet to play around with this in various games since I will need to make those purchases in the future.

-----

Display/Lens:
The lenses are improved to 1832 x 1920 from the Quest 1 at 1440 x 1600. This is close to 4K display and image quality is very good. I can barely see the screen door effect without even trying. I think even when I try to, I can't really see it. This is a god send in visual quality from the Rift S and the contrast is decent and pops out in color well. I feel like my eye do not strain as much compared to before.

As for the lenses, I think it uses the same lenses as the Quest 1. It is good however IMO, I think the lens design is a bit finicky. Compared to my Rift S, I feel like my eyes go out of alignment from center so easily and causes the sight on the edge of my eye go blurry or have god rays. It is bothersome, especially when you are playing games with a lot of head movement or workouts. I find myself re-aligning my eyes to the lenses to hit that sweet spot. This is sometime I do not experience with my Rift S.

The FOV (Field of View) is supposedly the same as the Quest 1. I definitely feel like the FOV is slightly smaller than the Rift S and kind of reminds me of putting my eyes through a binocular as an extreme example. This gets worse if you have the spacer or or wear glasses. The best way to work around this is to adjust it so that your eyes are close to the lens as possible.

PD (Pupilary Distance) is something that I feel is restricting. There is not much information regarding what group the PD adjustment corresponds to. You move the lenses left or right with your finger to make changes to the PD and try it out by trial and error with the 3 settings. My PD is around 63 and I don't feel like being grouped up with a few Milometers of error which bothers me. You can move the eye adjustment and make it so that the number is in between to make half increments but who knows if that will cause damage overtime as there is a nudge feel for each number.

-----

Software:
As you may have know, this is now owned by Facebook department. You will need to sign in with your Facebook account to use this Quest 2. I did encounter an issue with setting this up with my phone and I found that I had to reinstall the app to show the Quest 2 pair on the phone. After that, I set everything up to private and hopefully my games are for my eyes alone without interruptions and worry about my data going public. If you have any issues with your Facebook account, I recommend you to send a support ticket with oculus Facebook to address with that issue.

-----

Overall:
I pleasantly enjoy this headset very much. I have more freedom to walk around and bring this headset anywhere without needing my computer. Just don't use this outside in the Sun. It is just a matter of time what content will come out for this. This may not be for everyone, like the PD adjustment or if you find something about Quest 1 bothers you like God Rays in the lenses and FOV then it may not be for you. If you are new to VR, this will highly suit your needs to give VR a test run!",Hardware Platform: Oculus Quest 2 - 64 GB

    VR is good now! Cut out the creepy data collection
  
",4.0,jimbojones,"Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2021","









  
  
    
  I remember years ago when VR first started coming out and it was extremely clunky, and I made a mental note to check back in into the future once VR became good. We have arrived ! ! It's easy to conceptualize where we're heading into the future with even better capabilities but this is an amazing piece of equipment. The games are great and the web browsing is amazing (if you get my drift). My only complaint is that since Oculus is owned by facebook you need to link account - which is absolute BS - though if you take some tedious time creating new google account and new facebook account you can fulfill the requirement to access and use the device without handing them all of your personal information on a silver platter. So, lose a star on that and I think their sales would be higher if they decentralized the creepy data farming aspect. All in all a great and affordable device.

  the headset is nice and fun. That’s not the problem it’s the account. If you can’t access your account you can’t do anything. This would not be a problem is oculus support was better.

If it didn’t require Facebook to run the account and just  have one account for the whole thing it would be smoother and not as many problems.

  I love the oculus quest 1 and wanted to love the 2. Some things I love. The size and weight is great. The graphics are a little better than the first. You can also definitely tell that the processor is faster. Los times are shorter and the games are more fluid. The one fatal flaw, however, is that there are only 3 ipd settings on this one. If your pupil distance isn’t exactly one of these three settings, your experience  will be blurry and nausea inducing. That’s what happened to me. So great system but only for a percentage of people.

  To make it short, the Headset is absolutely stunning and very easy to use. If it weren't for the Facebook account requirement, it would be an easy 5 Star product. However, the notion that FB will get telemetry data about every single game you play, how you play and tons of more information makes me kinda hesitant to even use the headset. Worse, if FB decides to block your account for any reason whatsoever,  your shiny $399 piece of new hardware is rendered useless.

  This is the most fun you can have at home.  You will find your virtual world can be better than your real world.  I use it for workouts (supernatural workout is amazing), and for travelling to places that i may never see in real life (like a 3d 360 degree tour of Notre Dam being reconstructed).  Expect to pay $10-30 per game, while some are free, and most tours are free.  I've had it for a month, purchased the smaller memory, and am fine with that size memory.  You will love it and want to share it with people, because it's so amazing.

The joy stick on each hand is what should be standard, if it isnt already. For the 100 dollar price difference from 64 to 256, theres no question, get the more memory. Overall, im looking to get thr battery extender to counter balence the front. Its not huge issue by any means (every vr headset will have wight, regardless) but If the headset and controller is 90% then this battery extender/back head strap is the last 10%

Just watch a free 360 video on youtube and you are instantly transformed into an alternate reality!!! You want to visit Moscow? Boom, you are flying over the red square. Seriously this is beyond cool!- No wires. This is my first VR. I've read about previous generations of VRs with wires can't imagine having to wrestle with these wires while playing. So glad this does not require any!- Graphics are great, responsive and realistic in some applications and gamesCons:- Fit: it can hurt after a prolonged wear- Battery: You are lucky to get 2 hours of continuous play- Sound: The built in speakers are ok, not great- Connecting app: To connect the app to the headset (to watch what the player is seeing) is spotty and does not work all the time.

",2.0,why,"Reviewed in the United States October 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  We were told this would support Rift games...it does not.  We were told this supports SteamVR games...it does not.  The current library has only about 30 titles.  2 of which I actually wanted to play.  I've had this for three days now and have completed one of the games.  The other gives me slight motion sickness and is on the boring side, so I don't play it frequently. Today I spent about 20 minutes browsing the Quest store looking for something that would interest me.  NOTHING.  Then I put my headset on and looked at my available games with great disappointment.  I then removed it and powered it down.  I have nothing interesting to do or play on this.  This is incredibly frustrating and disappointing to me.  I am one of those people who really doesn't mind buying a console just to play two games, but I have never put one down three days after purchase out of boredom.  The novelty of VR itself wore off in 48 hours?  I really hope some of the Rift or Steam titles quickly make it to this platform or it will go back.  Had the docs been truthful about the lack of backward compatibility, I would have waiting several years to purchase this platform.  However with a non user replaceable battery, I am not going to let this sit around and wait for titles while the battery ages out.

On console it’s a pretty cool game , but on VR it becomes a completely different and more amazing game .The only con I have to say is the battery life .It’s not the longest lasting , but it works and has a decent amount of play time before charging is required .The only reason it has bad reviews is because of people who hate Facebook .

  The first time I tried VR was on a friends Oculus Rift S and his beefy PC, a set up that cost him about 2 grand. Not long ago I tried another friends original Oculus quest, both of those experiences where mind blowing. I have wanted to get the original Oculus quest for some time now but I held off, I am glad that I did, I bought this thing as soon as I saw it advertised, I haven't had for long so I can't speak to its longevity but I will definitely update this if I notice any problems with it. The resolution per eye is higher than even the valve index, a $1000 dollar headset that still requires a good gaming PC to run properly, the 72-90hz display is not amazing but it's more than acceptable. Tracking is very accurate and feels very good. I have noticed that everyone is more or less prone to motion sickness but mostly it depends on what you are doing or what game you are playing. However, it does require you to login to Facebook, this personally does not bother me, however, if it does bother you, look elsewhere, and whatever you do, do not use a fake facebook account as if facebook finds out that you are using a fake account they will ban you and you will lose access to all the games and software that you payed money for. Overall this headset offers a very good experience, it is ideal for any who wants to try VR but does not have a powerful PC, or for someone who want a fully wireless VR experience, amazing.

  Bought this for my grandkids and it has been the hit for the holidays. Everyone plays it.  Grandkids, kids, parents, grandparents.  The device provides access to a number of games that puts the players at the center of a virtual reality experience. As an Combat Vet, I decided to try the game Onward.  WOAH, what an amazing experience.  The game placed me in a cartoon virtual world full of enemy combatants, and provided a number of options for me to engage the “enemy” to survive.  This system can be a lot of fun.  Some people may have a hard time getting accustomed to the VR experience, especially if they are prone to motion sickness. This device and games, however, are well worth the money.

  We have had this guy for a while now and love it so much.  It has some mild issues like battery life and some extremely minor tracking issues, but I think that is just because we grab the headset cover and smudge the cameras to much.  The battery life thing is a catch 22, on home hand, it keeps you from wasting your life away gaming.  On the other hand, sometimes that is exactly what you want to do!  I works great with an extra long charging cable and you can even use a portable backup charger to extend its life too.  I use an Anker power brick when I want to go the distance.  The updates have been great so far, with new features added every time.  The latest, Multi-User accounts, is the one I have been waiting on and I am so stoked it finally dropped.  Not all the games have merged over to shareable just yet, but hopefully, in the near future, they will be.  It is great for isolation workouts, hanging out with friends virtually, or just visiting places you have never been to.  If you are looking for a great way to get into VR, this is the very best!  Go for the larger hard drive.  You never know what you will want to add and, yes, it can be linked to your pc if you want more content then what Quest has to offer.  All in all, just get it!! You will not be disappointed!!!!

  You fork out $400 to get this product just to end up seeing in the setup that you are REQUIRED to have a Facebook profile and to be logged in at all times in order to use this $400 product you just purchased.Owners of the previous oculus were apparently notified that they will be required to abide by the same rules in 2 years. So basically, the company is saying, ""Thank you for your money, but this is still not really a product that YOU own"". Nobody sees this as a high level scam? Is it because they are a well known company? It might be legal, but it doesn't make it morally right or fair to the customer at all.With all of the data collection issues Facebook has been exposed for, I see it this way. You are paying $400 dollars to be forced to use their social media platform in order for them to collect and possibly sell more of your personal data.You are limited to the games they have unless you buy an $80 cord to hook to your pc to play more.

  This Oculus Quest 2 VR headset has turned the VR world on it's head and making it a true gaming console for every serious gamer. You can even watch 3D movies and get the true 3D functionality. So many things you can do besides watching a movie or 3D movies. You can play games but theirs a whole assortment of different type of games e. g., regular way to watch, immersive, 360, interactive, it's just amazing. The Oculus Quest 2 will keep you entertained for hours and you won't even realize the time spent. I had to buy a battery because the Oculus doesn't stay on long enough for me. Yes, I'm on for hours and the time goes by so fast chances are you're going to get hooked just like me. The graphics, the games, the movies, and the number of options available is by far more entertaining and makes this purchase a no-brainer. I read all the hype and I'm just another happy VR user contributing to the hype. I gave it 5 stars because it's worth every penny. Just take a look at all of the VR headsets our their and the Oculus Quest 2 is the only standalone this cheap. I also bought the HTC Vive Custom Audio Strap, more comfortable and has built-in audio phones, VR Power battery, which allows me to use my headset for up to 8 hours. Trust me, I've not come close to playing that long but I've played for more than 2 or 3 hours, a lens protector, and a stand that I can sit my headset and controllers on. The stand is easy to use and works great.I don't know what else to say about my new Oculus Quest 2 other than; if you're looking to buy a new VR headset and want to save hundreds of dollars, still get the high video resolution, powerful robust processor, and not have to connect to a computer every time you want to play, then this a no-brainer.

  I have been using VR since the Oculus Dev Kit 1 - I have owned multiple headsets from Oculus, HTC, and my go to for PC VR is the Valve Index.  Like a lot of people, I had a Quest 1 and played it with friends that don't have PC VR and never had any issues with it, games played well and it was as clear as expected (with the resolution it has).The specs on the Quest 2 made it a no brainer to upgrade and I was excited to have it arrive today (on launch day).  Of course, I couldnt wait and jumped right into it.  Now, Im sure the limited 3 IPD settings will be fine for many people, but for me, NONE of them hit the sweet spot.  The Middle is the closest, but at this setting, I can only play for about 15 minutes before feeling sick and when I take the headset off my vision is off.  I had a similar issue with the PiMax 5k, which is why I sold that headset after months of waiting for PiMax to fix the issues (which, to my knowledge, is still an issue for many people in the PiMax forums).So you may have no issues with the one of the three IPD settings - but you may, and if you do, the headset will be a challenge to use for any amount of time.  Ill give it another shot tomorrow, but this is the PiMax issue all over again, so I dont think it will work out well - no matter how many times I attempt to use it.

Where’s the PSVR 2.0 (I don’t think I can go back to wires).

  Let me start by saying the last VR I used was back in 2016.. the OSVR.. it cost about 400 and came with  no controllers.. Oculus Rift was the big boy back then and priced like it, with their controllers.. unlike Rift, there was a ton of hoops to jump thru to get OSVR to work and it did fine with steam etc for about a year seated... then collected dust.. Like computers, it seems every 4-5 years something appears that pushes us forward.  Advance 4 years and I finally see a price point with controllers that looks interesting and gets a lot of Hype on the internet.. Hey, facebook bought out Oculus a while back for 2 billion and they have deep pockets to make this a success.. and right off.. yes, it looks like it will be.. Wireless standalone or Linked to PC with Steam Games..  Amazon Prime Movies and other ways to watch movies and TV.. it really does do it all.. and looks ""good enough"" doing it..The Hype is real... it is a very good and easy to get hooked up device.. as a stand alone device it couldn't be easier.. and has its own little store to spend your money at and install games with nothing else needed.. well, you have to have a phone and their app and facebook account and then you're good to go...using a ""Quest Link"" or even a non Quest link cable with good Quest reviews on the cheap (mine was 18 bucks), still works just as good if you hook to a PC.. or good enough..  this will allow you to play your STEAM and PC VR games on the headset.. youtube is your friend to figure all this out..The first program I installed was called Virtual Desktop.. making an access point to my PC wireless.. danged if that didn't work about as well as the ""link"" cable... and it shows 90hz as an option.. but without it or thru the link its 72hz headset for me.. so there is some play on sales pitch at launch.. or I have something mixed up.. but I am still grinning while I continue to figure it all out. 300 bucks for a VR headset and controllers, launched by a deep pocket company pushing VR tech further? yeah..I had to try it.People hate that they need a Facebook account.. Why? if not them, you would have an oculus account.. same difference, they have owned it for a while now.. just like Microsoft, Google, Twitch, Twitter etc etc.. if you are on the internet..you are hooked up and data tracked by someone and from everyone... oh yeah, you can hide from your family on Facebook that you bought this.. lol.. but why? its a great price and performance product.. and it is only going to get better..

    FACEBOOK CAN JUST DISABLE YOUR FB ACCOUNT AND MAKE YOUR QUEST 2 USELESS!!!

  I've been looking forward to this VR headset since they announced it. I pre-ordered it as soon as possible, and I didn't even care if you had to log in with facebook. I didn't have a facebook account, so I made one about a week before I was getting my quest 2 in my excitement as October 13th grew closer. October 13th comes, I get my headset, I try to log in to use my quest 2 and start buying games right away, and I was stopped in my tracks to find that facebook just disabled my profile the same day. Why? I would also like to know. I filled out the appeal they asked for, sent them a picture of my driver's license (which is super messed up btw) and I have no idea what so ever when I'm gonna be able to use my headset. It's a $300 paper weight sitting on my desk. If facebook's algorithm decides to disable your account, your quest 2 will completely useless, you've been warned...

  Pros....... Absolutely amazing realism. Truely does feel like your are in the game. Lightweight and video quality for movies is very good. Free games and apps were surprisingly good as well. Cons...... Let's get the worst out of the way first, battery life. With no games downloaded and fresh off a full charge, you get 1 hour playing time tops. Cut that down even more once you start downloading games or stream to a device. Yes you can play while charging, but the cord gets in the way ALOT. Second issue is freezing. After about 6 hours of use in 3 days, it had froze on me 3 times and just shut down and lost all game progress. Last issue I found was how little room for error you have to see clearly. If the oculus isnt sitting on your face just right, things get blurry. I never could find that happy medium between having them loose enough to be comfortable, and having them tight enough not to move. At the end of the day I ended up returning it. Just had to many problems to justify paying 400 bucks for it.

   I just got in the Oculus Quest 2 this week and have been loving it. I've been always interested in the VR space for a long time and felt like now is a good time to get into it. Mainly with Half Life: Alyx available as the first huge AAA game to focus on VR.Picking this up on pre-order at $299 was the perfect price for what they have to offer IMO. 90hz, increased resolution, overall improvements over the last Quest seems like the perfect combination for entry level VR. Seems sort of hard to say entry though, because my experience thus far is phenomenal. Utilizing the controllers for grabbing and detection of your fingers is super neat. Grabbing objects, throwing them, shooting guns, dancing with a robot, it's nuts and it's easy to experience in the first tutorial.I immediately ordered a USB-C 16ft cable to go along with it to hook up to Steam VR / Oculus Link on my desktop and it worked perfectly. Loaded up Half Life: Alyx, and took off. Everything worked well with the game and highly recommend running through it with this. All I needed was the one cable and a capable machine and I was good to go. I was absolutely blown away by the experience with the Quest 2 and Half Life: Alyx, it was like nothing I've ever played before getting up close and personal with one of my favorite franchises.If you're interested in VR, I would highly recommend checking this out. I will say the only downside so far is there is a lot of pressure on the forehead without the ""expert / advanced / upgraded"" headset add-on for $50 or something. For now I'll just keep adjusting the headset, but it does limit some length of time I'd be able to play for.As far as ""screen door effect"" goes with a lot of VR experiences that people discuss, I do notice this just ever so slightly if your eyes aren't adjusted to the lenses. But I assume there's only so much sharpness you can achieve at the moment with this resolution.Overall, I highly approve and can't wait to check out more games with this. Hope it helps!

  Can't play any games that require a pc because you can't sign into your Oculus account on a computer.  I'm in a loop.  It prompts you to sign into Facebook, you sign into Facebook, it prompts you to sign into your Oculus account, repeat, repeat.  Wanna watch someone play on your phone screen?  It says you can do it with your Oculus account.  Only problem, you get on the same exact sign in loop.  If you're thinking you wouldn't merge your Facebook account to your Oculus, wrong.  It requires you to.  Facebook is more concerned with mining our data than giving us a good game system.  I'm not even going to attempt to describe my utter disgust with this system.  According to reddit, ppl have been having this problem for since the product was released, and customer support has no answer.  How hard could it be to let me sign into the Oculus account I'm required to setup to use the headset?

  I am a VR enthusiast.  I own most of the mainline VR headsets (Vive, Vive Pro, Index, Quest 1, Cosmos) and play VR a *ton*This headset is an atrocity to the fundamental rights to ownership of your hardware.Imagine if being blocked by Facebook disabled every device you own.  All your computers, game consoles, monitors/TVs, controllers, phones, headsets, all movies, music, and apps you have ever purchased.  This is the future we will all live in if people allow travesties like this VR headset to thrive.  Do not buy this unless this is the future you want to encourage.Facebook has the power to block/ban/deny you an account for any reason they see fit and even revoke your ability to use your device you paid for.  Even though I haven't done anything wrong, I am one of those people that has been denied.  If your device/account gets banned and you're outside the return window, you're SOL and have a multi-hundred-dollar brick on your hands.  Good thing I was able to return my device (thanks, Amazon).  I encourage everyone that owns a Quest 2 to return their device.  This is unacceptable.I don't care if your kid wants this for their Birthday.  If you want a decent future for your children, you will not buy this for them.If we live in a future where some power hungry, greedy, malicious company like Facebook is allowed to control the lives of people in this way, we are damning ourselves to a future of subservience and slavery.  Giving up rights is a slippery slope.Also, the first one I received had charging issues.  After I opened it from the box, and it shoved an update down my throat I put the headset down and went away, came back much later in the day and it was dead.  Plugged it up, and it was weird with charging.  I could get it to turn on sometimes but it wouldn't go above a few percent and kept discharging.  I made an exchange and the second one I got all the way to needing to sign up for a Facebook account and Facebook refused to allow me to have an account.  There are no people to contact to help me -- it's like Google's customer service.  There are no people to contact, there is no support.  There are only bots and computers and they will block/ban you and deny you the ability to use the hardware you paid for with literally no way to contact anyone to ask why or argue -- see my screenshot.  ""We have already reviewed this decision and it can't be reversed"".

  Had a much deserved 1-star review of the Quest 2 due to the inability of getting Oculus/FB customer support to fix the Facebook ""merge"" operation they conducted when registering the device.  Funny thing was, it appears that someone out there doesn't like those bad reviews and reported it as a violating of ""Amazon Review Standards"".Say what?  I gave a legitimate review.  Anyway, here's another richly deserved 1-start for the Quest 2.  Fact is, Facebook (who own Oculus) have badly mismanaged the rollout of this product.  It's sad, really, because it could have been a great device given the specs.  The registration and TOA for this product need to be redone before I would advise anyone to buy it.  Also, I would be careful with the purchase of all Oculus devices until the clean up their poor customer support operations.

  Most amazing VR experience to date. The performance of the product for the consumer scale is outstanding. Have used with the Oculus store games and on Steam. Performs amazingly if the setup and environment arrangements are done properly. Be sure your lighting is adequate. Also, be sure when using Steam or connecting to your computer with the Oculus Link cable (not included) that you log have the Oculus software downloaded and installed (may take a while to download) and that you enable the Oculus Link cable when the prompt pulls up, otherwise you have to unplug the cable from the headset and plug it back in to get the prompt to pop back up. Main thing is to take the time to do things properly and you won't be disappointed in the product. Performance wise, this is a phenomenal headset for a decent price. Also, I definitely see alot of value in the inward out tracking as opposed to systems that go outward in. Movement is very fluid without any latency. Hand controls are intuitive and work well with the in game functions. Feels like a second set of hands after you.are used to how to navigate them. Be sure to use the straps for the controllers. They will save you from accidentally throwing them. Screen resolution is amazing and the colors are on point. Highly recommend. Only downside is you must link a Facebook account. Just take the time during setup to block the access that you don't want to permit. Of course storage must be allowed in order for it to function and run games. Be sure to set your sharing parameters as well in regards to your Facebook information, same as you would choose on the Facebook app. Overall it has not disappointed.

  Lighter, better visuals and generally a good upgrade over the first Quest.  I added the $49 optional headband and find it more comfortable.  If you share the Quest 2 with anyone you'll really appreciate how easy it is to adjust.  The audio isn't quite as loud as I'd like--and I'm an old geezer--so you might consider some earbuds.  Experiment with your old iPhone earbuds; they work fine.If you're new to VR. . .ignore the bad reviews from the avid gamers and get one anyway.  Remember the technology is new.  Seems to me this about like TV in the 1940s: amazing technological advancement, but not much to watch.  Even so, sometimes it's amazing how your brain will react to the illusion that you are somewhere other than your living room floor.  I really had to work to ""step off"" a ledge in Machu Pichu or in an adventure game.  Some of the VR360 videos you'll find on YouTube give an incredible sense of immersion, sometimes a little creepy but a taste of what movies will become in a few decades.  Or months!As for the privacy issues people mention, well, privacy is probably just an illusion in our modern world, anyway.  But as soon as you get online you can go to Settings and turn off a few things.  Don't let it stop you from buying this.  The taste of what's to come in video is worth it alone, and traveling during the lockdown--I like the Wander app--is a great break from just staying home. . .while you just stay home.

  Wow Wow Wow! I am so impressed with this.

Fortunately I also ordered a third party elite strap from Amazon ahead of time. I tried the strap that came with the Quest 2 and it was awful. No big surprise, and I was ready for that. I don’t mind having to get a better strap because it’s probably keeping the price of the unit down a bit by shipping it with a cheap one.The controllers are comfortable and pretty easy to use. It does get a bit confusing at first but you quickly get used to it.I’m not going to bore you with stating what everyone else is saying. But I can say it’s an amazing unit and I will be spending many hours using it.

He had to actually make a Facebook account, download the app to his phone, the connect his new Facebook account to his Oculus account, and now logs into Oculus with his Facebook account.That is a horrible business model for a gaming device.

  I'll start with the con since it's the big turn off for a lot of people: it requires connection to a Facebook account that is in good standing. That sucks. I hope that changes, but I don't see Facebook letting go of that anytime soon.Otherwise, this thing is amazing. I got my first one back in November (and this is my first VR experience of my own ever). I got beat saber, superhot, eleven, and In Death Unchained, and all those games are a lot of fun. The tracking is really very good. Turns out that beat saber is quite a fun game and with Oculus Move now, I can track some loose fitness goals in games. That's cool too. Battery life is very good for the way I like to play (30-45 minutes at a time) so I can do a couple of sessions over a couple of days before I have to charge again. I think it's about a two hour battery life total, maybe a bit more. The controllers are comfortable and seem to be well made. The headset isn't too heavy and the three eye-separation settings seem to cover the ranges well enough. (I'm a 3, my wife is a 1). Overall, this setup is pretty incredible value if you don't mind the facebook requirement. Definitely recommend if you know someone interested in stepping into VR. The price is perfectly well justified for it being wireless and, quite frankly, just a smooth, fun experience.

    Incredible, next level device and experience
  
",5.0,Tim Consolazio,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  I tried a couple of headsets a while back, and was consistently underwhelmed. Yes the sense of height and all that was incredible, and of course I saw the potential. But for a reasonably decent experience you had to be tethered to a PC, and it was always a bit of a wrestling match. ""Not ready for prime time"" was always my assessment.That's over. OVER. This device is next level beyond belief. After being wowed by the Home menus and so forth, I checked out a bunch of the freebie immersive animations, videos, etc. Very cool, a big step forward, but I again thought, ""is this it...if it is this device will be gathering dust in a couple of months.""So, I said let me check out a premium pay-for option. I played ""The Room"" as my first game purchase. I had actually played one The Room games on my iPad and enjoyed it, so eh why not.For two hours I did nothing but say ""OH MY GOD."" My wife got so sick of hearing me that she said LET ME SEE!!!! I put the headset on her, told her a couple of basic things, and she was off and running. Same reaction. OH MY GOD...OH...MY...GOD!!! I AM ON THE HOLODECK, I AM ACTUALLY ON THE HOLODECK!!!The immersive totality exceeded my expectations in every way. Sure, you're dealing with a big thing strapped to your head, and after a while you do find yourself adjusting it a lot (you eventually learn it's not supposed to sit on your nose, it's supposed to sit on your cheek bones, which not only makes it more comfortable, it makes the view clearer). I'm hoping the premium head strap thing cleans that up.Aside from that, I could go on and on. Even the sound quality kicks ass. (Some criticize it for not having earbuds, I think that might be a good thing...the isolation would be so complete you'd be completely unaware of your surroundings, which could be dangerous). And that was only with one game, some demos, and some casual exploring of the overall capability. There are apps that let you share your computer screen and WORK in a virtual space that other people can join and collaborate in. IT IS ASTONISHING and I'm going to try that out today (I'm a coder/techie guy by trade).Folks, unless you are some kind of VR prima donna, I absolutely assure you that quality VR for the masses has arrived. The device is an astonishing, next level triumph. I've been into video games for 45 years, even dabbled in development, and envisioned this experience, thinking maybe one day before I die I might see a piece of it.If this is where it's at now, then fully immersive Holodecks are really just a handful of engineering challenges now. In twenty years I have little doubt you'll be able to put some device in the middle of your room, turn it on, and get this experience.Next: objects that you can place in your playfield that you can physically interact with. Simple cubes and spheres that look like rocks, animals, anything. The controllers already do it; in ""The Room"", if you set the controllers on the ground and step away, you see a pair of leather gloves lying on the floor (your hands). You just walk over and pick them up.Again, on and on I could go. Astonishing. Well done Oculus.

    Big upgrade but some downgrades too
  
",3.0,Huihong Dai,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  The first thing you'll notice is the new controllers are fat and awkward to hold. It doesn't hold like a gun (even though there is a trigger), and it doesn't hold like a stick. It's also big and round, forcing you to always grip it in an awkward way.The default head strap setup is definitely a major downgrade from before. The nylon just clips my ears and always rubs against it. It's also much harder in this new design to quickly adjust the tightness.Pros: - New processor (though you won't notice any difference if using Oculus Link or with current games). - Higher resolution (this is more of a minor upgrade since it's not a monumental leap in resolution). - Despite the an attempt to cut costs, it's a good value for what it does in terms of VR.Cons - No OLED. Black scenes are a very very bright gray. - Fat awkward controllers that will definitely reduce your competitiveness in Beat Saber - Facebook login is required, even if you had an Oculus account (and you lose your paid purchase if your account is banned) - Really bad battery life - Only 3 IPD adjustment levelsOverall this is a good entry level VR headset that's about 90% of the way of something more expensive like the Valve Index. But Facebook is definitely trying to target cheap and accessible rather than premium experience.

I am prone to tension headaches in the head and the pressure that the headset applies to my face and the weight, I'll be it very light weight, it applies to my next muscles just calls for a headache. Trying multiple different methods of adjusting the headset didn't help either, I was still struggling to enjoy my experience while playing. I played a variety of games from VRChat to EchoVR to Pavlov, all very fun in their own sense but in my case I was unable to fully enjoy them for more than an hour before I couldn't tolerate the strain on my head. I am almost sure that most other people won't have as much of an issue with it as I did since I am prone to tension headaches. The strap is also quite uncomfortable and displeasing to wear for long periods of time. I definitely recommend, if you really want this VR, that you get the $50 strap by Oculus or their other battery strap, that can also double as a counter weight on the back of your head to release some of the strain on your neck.By all means I don't think VR is terrible or anything like that, it's a great experience, but unfortunately I seem to be unable to fully enjoy it without feeling some type of discomfort. My nose kept getting tickled by the nose cut out on the headset as well! Only a small gripe but it was OBNOXIOUS! I kept having to readjust and my cheeks, jaw, and facial muscles felt stiff and ached during and after my VR sessions. I really wished I could've had nicer things to say about this VR Headset but I simply didn't enjoy my experience with it.I think I'd like to leave off on a positive note here, this VR headset is an INSANE value for your money. $300 for an entry level VR Headset that can double as a dedicated VR headset with high resolution specs? Who could complain about that! I wouldn't, but I did, and that's why you've read this far :). By all means pick one of these headsets up and give it a try, Amazon's super chill about returns on these and I had zero problems doing so. So why not? Give it a shot and see if you like it!

  An out of box experience from 20 years ago.  Horrible manual process to type information.  To create a Facebook account to even use the device, you have to jump through a ton of hoops.  To use steam vr games (the games on the oculus store are a joke) you need to either run a cable or do remote desktop vr.  Do not buy this garbage.

  Nearly everything about this new iteration of the Quest is a massive improvement, from the beefy processor to the economic price tag.  However, a major issue I have is just how slim they made the headpiece.  Be very wary if you have glasses because the headset facepiece is always getting caught around my glasses, something that never happened with my Rift S.  It has made an otherwise glowing device slightly dull by comparison.  Disappointing, to say the least.  You can have a great tech device but if its a pain the ass to put on and take off and is uncomfortable, is it really all that great?

  The fifth star is for price.Let's compare to Quest Original:Q0 wins:Screen blacknessPupillary distance adjustmentCross buy with some Go appsComes with a decent strapQ2 wins everything else:Higher ResolutionScreen door effect almost goneBetter processor can do better graphics.More comfortable controllersMore accurate controllersMore memoryLighterI could probably go on.The real trade offs are the strap and the screen.Let's face it, Oculus never understood comfort.  This is the most comfortable one yet.  Wireless and reasonably light.  You can get a better strap.  People got better straps for their Q0s too.The screen trades blackness but gains resolution and the screen door grid from Q0 is gone.  Ok it's (barely) there but the other issues that are in both headsets are far worse.I don't count the ipd adjustment as a big deal but maybe I'm lucky with my head size.  Honestly I was never satisfied with the Q0 and was always fiddling with itOculus Quest 2 is an excellent device, especially for the price.It's not perfect in any way and there will certainly be better in a few years but it's fun.

    Better visuals at a cost of comfort (one size fits most scenario)
  
",2.0,Frank,"Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  While boasting better visuals (for what I can see) it's too much of a downgrade in comfort for me to score any higher. The facial interface is the biggest problem asides from the poor IPD Slider. The less foam. More hard plastic pales in comparison to the Quest 1's as I can fit my glasses in fine and adjust it perfectly on my face. However unless a new facial interface just like the Quest 1 is produced it causes my face pain and makes it difficult to enjoy the experience and due to max IPD being 68 which I could use on my Quest 1 quite comfortably with the facial interface being very accomadating I cannot see but a little in one of my eyes before blurriness occurs while only one eye can see just about right.I really was more hopeful about this but I honestly if I still can return it I would and buy another quest one as the screen door effect can be dealt with. This discomfort on my face can not and I can not help having to have glasses and a large head.

  Very good visual fidelity and all wireless is convenient, otherwise worse in almost every way from my first gen wired rift headset.The three ipd adjustments was a poor choice to cheap out on, it gives a poor experience to many because you can't dial it in just right. The tracking sucks in non ideal conditions, it regularly misses hits in beatsaber that are really close to your body. It also does not work in the dark which I had no problems with on my first gen and a virtual movie theater.The Internet and Facebook requirements are awful and set the landscape for a scary future. I think the hardware in here is really impressive, but there are too many negatives that caused me to get rid of this headset.

  I was so excited for this product, having played with a friend's Quest.  Also, many of my friends play Supernatural and I thought it would be a fun way to work out during the pandemic.  I was so disappointed to finally put the headset on and discover that everything but the text directly in front of me was blurry, no matter which IPD setting, how I positioned it on my face, with or without glasses spacer (I don't wear glasses), etc.  I want to love it, but I can't justify keeping such an expensive product for such a sub-par visual experience.Update:  I have been able to improve the blurriness of the product significantly but at additional expense. First, I ordered the elite headstrap, which helped keep the Oculus from moving on my face.  I also purchased a wide facial interface. $100 in additional costs, and I have a product that isn't perfect, but has helped me workout, play games, and stay sane during stressful COVID-19.

    Great headset, facebook requirement is a bummer.
  
",5.0,A Had,"Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2021","









  
  
    
  While I'm sad Facebook bought this company and forces you to link an account in order to use the hardware, the hardware itself is just amazing.I bought this as a gift after experiencing the headset for myself, and the recipient is loving it. Not only can you use the headset standalone, plug it into your computer with any USB C cable for use with games on steam or other platforms, but there are even ways to wirelessly link the headset to your computer!I would like a worthy competitor to enter the space so I could protest the forced Facebook inclusion by supporting the other guy, but they would have some LARGE shoes to fill if they want to compete. Can't help but give it 5/5 stars because I was floored by how good this VR experience is.Prior to this I had configured some experiences on a Samsung Galaxy + Gear VR, the HTC Vive, HTC Vive Pro, the original Oculus Quest, and I personally own the Oculus Rift CV1. This headset gave me the best experience compared to any of those, hands down (I only say that it beats the Vive Pro due to the pain of setting up the entire room for using it, which I had to do REPEATEDLY). Abandoning base stations was a move in the right direction for personal VR experiences, and the value you get for the price with these is just incredible.If I had to complain, I feel like the shape of the head strap does put a little bit more weight on the bridge of your nose than it should. That's part of the draw of upgrading to the ""Elite strap,"" which I have not personally tested.

  Pros: this is a big advancement from the previous quest. The display is amazing and the tracking is just a tad better than the previous quest. The price is great for what you get. Battery life is decent but the controller battery life is best of any. Everything functions well and the side loading is just as easy as ever. Cons: the head strap that's the biggest thing. The head strap will rub and start to hurt especially around the ear. Also if you have long or thick hair it likes to grab and pull a bit. The elite strap easily replaces this but then that's another expense but we'll worth it. The other con is the face pad. I have sensitive skin and the face pad made a red ring around my face after the first hour and I had a massive breakout that stayed for about a week. To prevent this I took an extra leather face pad from my quest 1 and ripped the foam off the quest 2 and used a soft flexible stretchy glue to adhere the leather pad directly on the bracket for the quest 2

    The Pros, Cons and Oks for Oculus Quest 2 (HR).
  
",3.0,,"Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2020","Pros:__________
• The pricing for this machine is spot on. Throughout the years of these designs, the basic platforms are defiantly an agreeable price range. This is coming from a person who has bought the past two models.
• Gaming Virtual Reality (VR) is a different world of gaming. Since many haven’t experienced this before, I’ll say that the games are playable, fun, and defiantly something you’ll use numerous times.
• Of all programs in the Oculus, my favorite is the Netflix’s app. When in use, the Oculus takes you to a ski lodge where you’re sitting in front of a huge TV. This creates and awesome experience when you’re watching a movie on it (you will get lost in where you’re at.).
• There are also numerous short clips that take you throughout the world. Want to run into the stadium during the start of the NFL game, you can do that? Fly in a black hawk helicopter, yes you can. What I love about the Oculus is that it’s so much more than a gaming counsel.
• Compare to the previous design this Quest is a little smaller, but does have the same rounded plastic front. This helps reduce its weight when wearing it.
• The link cable is significantly longer than the previous model. This was a big issue for me because a short cable restricts your movements. Moving the USB-C port connector in the back surprisingly aids in making sure the cable doesn’t get in my way if I need to charge it while playing.
• Motion tracking is accurate. The camera also tracks the controllers pretty accurately. I try to trick it, but the camera sensors weren’t playing around. This feature was also integrated with the original Rift. Both aided in making it an immersive experience.
• Appreciate the built-in a 3.5mm headphone jack. The days of headphone jacks are gone, which makes this a great perk in my eyes.
• Adjusting the eye mask was super easy for me and my niece. She’s 10 years old and wears glasses. The Quest has a separator that lifts the headset away from your face. It’s an accessory that comes with the Quest and a great tool for those who need glasses.
• The straps do a pretty good job of balancing the weight of the headset. It’s important to note that the headset isn’t that heavy in the first place since most of it is made of plastic. I and my niece gave it a B on adjustments (Kinda annoying when you’re getting used to it).
• I felt these controllers are a little more thinker than the previous model, but it gives you a feeling that these controllers are secure if you accidentally drop them.
• One of the best designs in the controller is the battery door (That’s right). What I hated about the past models was the battery door of the controllers would come off very easily, resulting in frustration when playing a game. It looks like the Oculus team has listened and fixed this problem. Very happy about this.
• For the battery power controllers, I got two weeks, using it an average of an hour a day. But if you’re going to watch movies than expect a longer time before replacing it. An improvement for sure.
• Backward compatible gaming.
• The higher display is noticeable different compare to the previous model. Everything looks sharper, higher saturated, and overall crisp. For those who are new, it’s similar to looking at an HD TV very close. It’s great in quality, but if you focus you can see each pixel. This isn’t a real problem because the imagery is very vibrant (50% more pixels than the previous model). I played Gun Club and it’s quite an experience shooting at the driving range with the display.
• Overall I played with probably random games before this review, and not once was this machine slow in speed when moving around. My only advice is to have two arm lengths of room all around. Many times in past models my feet have hit too many hard pieces of furniture.
• Very simplistic about learning to play with this machine. There are around 2-4 buttons you use daily. Young and old will be able to use this without issue (downloading games might not be for them).
• It supports Wi-Fi 6. This means faster downloads, consistent connection, and efficient wireless streaming. Not putting too much in this because my Wi-Fi connection is already pretty strong, but this is useful for those who have a weak one.

Cons and Oks:__________
• You need a Facebook account to use this machine. Want to be off the grid, don’t want companies to use your data, you’re out of luck. Either sign up on Facebook or don’t play.
• What happens if you get suspended on Facebook, or your account is locked? Can I make a fake account or will that be blocked? These are questions that the Oculus team hasn’t yet given us a solution for.
• Again privacy issues come into play with Facebook because they have the option to target ads based on the games you’re playing.
• The battery life still stinks. Maybe 2.5 hours if I play it safe. For gaming all the time I got around 2 hours. Watching “Lost in Translation” (2 hr film), brought it down to 10% (BTW, a great film to watch with this). It's basically the same battery life as the original.
• When you get around 15% battery life, a popup will tell you to plug it in. This is very annoying if you’re in a movie or playing a game. Just make an alert noise Oculus team.
• Even though it’s smaller than the previous model, it’s still a pain in traveling with this. You can’t just put it in your bag. The lenses are the most concerning because a scratch in them can destroy your whole experience.
• I found the hand tracking system is “someone” accurate if you’re comparing it to the original Quest. But gestures like pinching or turning your palm I notice it gets accidentally triggered by mistake. Also at times the Quest fails to register my hand movements altogether. It’s still a perk that you’re able to tweak the settings to fit your comfort, but still not the main controller replacement.
• The Quest has an elite strap that is around $50. This concerns me because they’re basically saying that the straps that are on the VR might break.
• Never a fan of USB Type-C charging because it takes over an hour to charge the Quest fully. With an average of 2 hours of use, you can see the math of how much you need to charge it. Also I notice that a compute charge connector isn’t quicker than connecting to a wall socket.
• Still AA batteries for the controllers. Even though the battery length has increased, it’s annoying because no has AA on standby. I had to go to a gas station for AA just for this device since all my tech tools can be rechargeable.
• The black levels are a little less improved, or equal, from the previous model. Still decent, but nothing impressive.
• Whish they kept the small fabric lining in the inside of the device. Sadly that’s gone.
• FYI, many games will give you motion sickness. For me, they are the roller coaster and the space battle games.
• They have a virtual desktop system where you can wirelessly stream your computer to the Oculus for the cost of $20. Don’t get this. Overpriced and no quick way to type as you have to move the controllers to each letter on the virtual keyboard one at a time.
• As of late 2020, there hasn’t been establishing games that use the Oculus to its full 90 Hz potential.
• Connecting the Oculus to a computer while playing does give you a boost in speed in my eyes. With potential games like Half-Life, you want to play the game in the best graphics you can. Using without a computer will kill your battery life probably in an hour when playing a game like that.
• Facebook has officially discontinued the Oculus Rift S and the Oculus Quest, leaving Oculus Quest 2 the only one it’s focusing on.
• Be warned: if you live in a cold environment, you need to wait until the Oculus heats up. If you put it on right away, the lenses will fog up. The reason why is because we give off heat and when you have something warm near something cold, condensation becomes the problem. Sadly there is no solution other than waiting it out or to turn on your heater.
• There are still limits to this tech. Most games are not visually real-life realistic.
• You're staring at a computer screen inches from your eyes. Expect some eye irritation when you're wearing it for at least an hour. Note that I felt no eye irritation when watching a movie but only when I'm playing an active game.
• The built-in speakers are average. No bass, thin, no immersive feeling, overall just volume. Games like Beat Saber are best with headphones (In fact everything you use with this needs headphones). This is a nice gesture for the people around you because let’s be honest, no one wants to hear what you’re playing.
• As of late 2020 Facebook isn’t letting developed ship Quest 2-exclusive content. Everything is under Facebook. Complete control.

Bottom Line:__________

A great price for what you’re getting, if you’re new to join the VR world. I used to be against this but I come to realize that the Oculus brings you to a world of not only gaming, but for watching movies, and YouTube web browsing. Not many can say that they have a 70inch television or an in-home movie theater. The Oculus gives you that. You can play poker with an avatar figure of your choice, or watch TV if you use an app like Sling. I watched last year's Super Bowl on the previous model, and it was a great experience.

For previous Oculus owners, I've tested/used the original Quest and posted the review on Amazon. I can say confidently that that 95% of that review can be applied to this Quest. Feel free to look it up because the Quest 2 is really just a small upgrade in my book.

The display has improved but most everything else has been upgraded a tad. Obliviously I wasn’t able to test 90 Hz games fully, as they will be available I believe in 2021, but the experience of playing this Oculus hasn’t decreased the experience of playing in VR.

In the end VR is slowly growing but it’s going to take maybe 2 years before it becomes a full marketable industry. Playstation VR was a help, but other than that there are few anchor titles in the VR world. Yet I see this as an investment for next year because it seems Oculus just wanted to put this out before Christmas without really having the upgraded games that the Oculus’s processor can give. When the 90 Hrz games come out, then this industry will start getting interesting. Other than that, you have the Facebook issue, which is annoying, but you can’t win them all.

Overall: 2020-2021 best Virtual Reality for all ages, but not a must-have for those who already have the previous model.

(Edit: I decided to lower the review down from 4 to a 3-star review in order to put a focus on the complete control Facebook has on this Oculus. You're paying $300, no including the games, and Facebook can disable your account at a moment's notice, making this nothing more than a paperweight. As of 2020, this policy has been in effect and it's something that you really need to take into consideration before buying this.)

Hope I was a help to you.

  I have a lot of experience in gaming but pretty much new to VR.  I've been waiting for the tech to advance before  I decided to get on board.  For $299, I didn't think I would be losing to much to give this unit a try.  First impressions, after using it for a few days.... I am impressed.  I tend to suffer from motion sickness easily, so I was a little worried, but so far no issues with that.  I'm still exploring the content out there and checking out some games, but what I've seen so far it's been great.  I can see a great potential in the future of VR.  The gaming and educational possibilities are endless.  As for this unit, it is very easy to use, especially for someone like me with no VR experience.  The battery doesn't last too long, so I already ordered the extended battery w/ headstrap.  That's the other issue, starts to wear on the head a little after prolonged use.  I'm hoping the updated headstrap will help with that.  Lots of fun so far, I look forward to the future of this.

  I bought this as an upgrade for my Oculus Go. System wise, it is an upgrade, however software wise it is (So far) lacking in the software department, because they decided not to allow access to previous oculus libraries. I knew this going in and convinced myself the fact that I would be able to steam link my Oculus to my PC would make up for it... still waiting on a cable. I’ve re-bought a few games off the oculus store and they are enjoyable with the new control scheme, but still there is not really any reason to rush in and buy a system until there are more apps and games available.

  There are probably many reviewers here have given valuable comments and opinions already, and I don't need to repeat all of them.  I owned the first gen of Oculus Quest, and just bought a new Quest2.  I just want to briefly share my quick feedbacks and comparisons here:Pros:- Better video resolutions and quality- Headset is lighter than previous Quest- The graphic and performance feels smoother due to faster CPUCons:- Facebook account required to activate (This is a big deal to me, and my friends were all criticize it).  FB will collect and share your data to 3rd parties.  Let's assume your FB account got suspended or banned due to whatever reasons, your Quest2 will turn into a brick!  I managed to find a way to bypass Facebook account by installing an older version of the Oculus App on Android phone.  Check out YouTube how-to.- Quest2 came with only a short 3ft USB-C cable.  This is ridiculous as it's not helpful when the battery runs low while I'm still in the game.  My previous Quest came with 10ft USB-C cable.  What's Oculus thinking?

  Got the Quest 2 today. So far impressions are pretty good, really nice build quality and visual performance.Also purchased the elite head strap but it will be arriving 2 days later as well as the Logitech earbuds.Things to note:1. The fabric strap was actually pretty comfortable. No issues with my ears getting in the way like I've heard some reviewers complaining about. Had to tighten top strap quite a bit due to slack. I am an Asian, 5' 8"" and 180lbs for best reference so maybe my head isn't that big? IPD was 2nd setting as well.2. The stock face plate is foam padded. I can see this wearing out fast. Also getting sweaty and was certainly hot even after 1hr of use. Might get an aftermarket one.3. Could definitely see out the nose hole. Might be because my face is smaller, not sure. Don't notice it much when in an app however.4. The unit after 1hr got hot to the touch on the exterior. Kind of hot like in cell phone left in car in the summer, but not in direct sunlight. Not sure if this is normal.5. Sound is actually not bad from the speakers. Others can hear you though especially since you need it at max level to really enjoy it at a tolerable level. So highly recommend headphones of some kind.6. Overall pretty satisfied. Just hope this will last with no issues. Battery does barely last 2hrs like everyone says it does.7. Just a side-note, bought an anti-fatigue mat to use while standing. Think it greatly helps when playing for traction and comfort!Hope this helps people!

  This product is amazing; I no longer have to leave my house to go on adventures. There's no wasting time driving to and from places, no fees per entrance, it's just strap-in an go. The lens needs some getting used to, and finding that optical sweet spot at first can be a little tricky, but once it's found it's just smooth sailing. The future of VR technology thanks to this innovative company is looking great.There's currently some controversy with the required Facebook account though; personally I think the worry about the privacy is a little over-hyped, but I also understand the concern. If I put myself in Facebook's shoes, I'd actually do the same thing to prevent users from sharing a game en masse like Netflix being shared, which is a problem for streaming services in general. I mean, after all, Facebook has already established preventative measures for fake accounts and VR is still in it's infancy; we wouldn't want the VR industry to be killed because developers can't make money now right?

I ordered an EMF ""hood"" (silver lined) basically a tin foil hat, today in hopes that it helps. Never had a problem with EMF. Also was never a big fan of the whole smart phone thing so apparently I'm sensitive to these things now? Other than that I love it. I'm impressed. But I'm giving it one star because it's owned by a CIA-controlled Communist Chinese puppet, Mark Zuckerburg and he requires you to have a facebook account. I used a ""jailbreak"" loophole and signed up as an oculus ""developer"" and have full access to everything. I would have used my fb account but my fb account was permanantely banned 2 years ago because I had a facebook group with 350,000 people and it was pro-Trump. So that's where we're at now... Looking forward to seeing fb being brought down eventually.

  Excellent product.Cons:HEAVY!!! Can get very hot on your face. Blurry even with the eye adjustments. Glasses extender does not work (a friend of mine tried it out and it didn't allow enough clearance). High price point. Some games can cause motion sickness.Pros:Literally everything else. Extremely easy set up. Great interface. Wireless. Decent picture quality. Great speakers. Sleek design. Lightweight hand controllers with excellent design. Easy to adjust strap. Link cable (not included) allows you to have the same experiences through steam as the rift model, and with the help of a really long hdmi the whole family can feel as if they are mining with you! When wearing the vr you are no longer in a living room. It is extremely immersive and addictive. I have high hopes for the future generations of this vr line.

   If you’re debating on whether or not to get this or a switch or something. Get this. You won't be disappointed. I have a very nice gaming pc and have a very nice high refresh monitor, so some would say I enjoy the finer things in life. This my friend is the next step in gaming or even just immersion into what we have come to in our generation now. Completely blown away. I got the lower 64GB version expecting to rely more on my pc but boy was I wrong. It’s more powerful then I could have imagined and if you don’t have a powerful pc like me and want the vr experience alone with a lot of perks that other headsets don’t havego ahead and get it. Very very happy happy with what I received, even after watching numerous videos I could never have been ready for what this shows you technology has come to.Ps: hilarious when you show other (older)people, literally the home menus and are completely blown away like you were.

    Temper Your Expectations

  This unit is not what they advertise it to be. Too many corners cut makes for a tough VR experience:1. It is too heavy to workout with. My wife is small and this unit created terrible neck strain even with a battery pack strapped to the back for balance. It dug into my nose and cheek bones rather hard no matter how we adjusted it.2. The lenses are blurry and cannot be properly adjusted. Sliding them closer or father apart helps only a little. I have binoculars from 1972 with adjustable lenses. Just saying.3. Media resolution is lousy. Games are nowhere near detailed enough and videos are so blurry they'll make your eyes water. And yes, I installed the bracket for wearing glasses but saw only marginal improvement. The media is low resolution.4. Limited library of available content. What is available is juvenile in the extreme.5. Chromecasting Ultra is really needed to get any sort of decent video casting from the headset to a television.6. Some apps don't allow Chromecasting. You won't know until you buy them because the store's description of the app won't tell you.7. If the unit doesn't feel the face pressure it expects, it turns off and corrupts your game...repeatedly. If you look down at your feet, you decrease face pressure because gravity pulls the unit toward the ground. It's like wearing a diving mask to keep that pressure strong enough.8. Changing who is wearing the device requires completely exiting a game first or it will shut off and corrupt the game. There is no ""pause"" feature to prevent such a thing from happening.9. Most games won't let you lie down and play. If you're disabled, forget it. That's not a flaw with the unit.10. If you've never been in VR before, it's really amazing for about 10 minutes until your eyes start to burn, water, and blur or a headache starts. I was able to build up my tolerance to about 15-minutes with 10-minute breaks. Not really immersive for a hardcore gamer like me.11. I have boxed the unit back up in its original packaging and printed the RMA label. Makes me sad. I really tried to like it.

And now trying to setup a facebook account and all of a sudden it's telling me for security, I have to send in some id, photo or other item for them to review before I can log in to face book which is required to use my VR I just purchased for over $400.00.  I'm a person who firmly believe that the more information you place on the web the more chances you are of being a target of fraud and mischief.  Facebook need to make this a chose and not have people forced to login to facebook and provide them personal items.  If this is how they contact business for consumer products, they need to be broken up into separate companies.  I should not need to provide such items to them when I'm not interested in social media ... period!!!

    A great headset until you need to contact support. Oculus support is pathetic.
  
",1.0,FDP,"Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2021","









  
  
    
  I was an original Rift kickstarter backer. I've used all but one generation of the headset since then, developed enterprise content for Oculus products and been an evangelist for VR and Oculus as a company. The Quest 2 is an impressive, fantastic device - when it is working. That last part is important.I had the misfortune of having issues crop up with my headset several months into use. I am unsure if these are due to a software update, I suspect that they are not. My experience with Oculus support has been so terrible that I would warn anyone considering purchasing their products to consider my support experience as part of their purchase decision.First I searched several forums including reddit and Oculus' forums before trying to contact Oculus support. They have a support page, but it has very little information available, instead you have to engage with their support bot through a chat window.You can request to speak to a human being through the bot. I spoke to several, all at the same support tier. In spite of clearly stating my issue and the headset I was using at various points I was given answers for a Rift headset (different product), Oculus Link/PC issues (not related to my problem, I clearly stated I wasn't using link and was using native apps). The unhelpful, confused responses I received from representatives ranged from repeat suggestions on things I had said were not related (like Oculus Link) to blatant falsehoods.Not helping matters is the fact that the Oculus chat will disconnect you from a representative on mobile if the chat window loses focus, even for a second. After over an hour of trying to get help and ~4+ support reps giving unhelpful suggestions I asked to be elevated to a higher support tier.Instead of elevating directly to another support tier in the chat window, Oculus support instead e-mails you and you have to reply to the email to theoretically get help. This e-mail is a form e-mail asking you to restate your problem. If you respond you will get an identical form e-mail in response. Sometimes two. I have received no less than 25 of these e-mails over a period of 9 days. After four days of no human responses I received two somewhat conflicting human responses, both form-like in content and both telling me that support would help answer questions at some point in the future, maybe 3 days, maybe 5. When I emailed to let them know that their own stated time limit had expired I got the standard, automated form e-mail as response.There is no phone number to call for Oculus support. This is the experience. If you have a very basic problem (e.g. the headset won't turn on) they may be able to help you in a timely manner.Personally I do not have time to deal with the wall of garbage that Oculus offers up as a support experience. Their customers' time and patience appears to have zero value to them. This is a fundamentally disrespectful way to interact with customers and Oculus/Facebook should not be rewarded for it with sales.

  ONE OF MY BEST ENTERTAINMENT GADGET I EVER BOUGHT.  I almost give up this gadget because it gave me  dizziness. But after changing the  strap to adjustable Oculus Elite Strap($49.99), My wife and me enjoyed this gadget so much. We used it mainly for watching traveling VR since we are getting old and semi retired. I cannot express how incredible this gadget is. A lot of free VR in youtube 360° and 180° and even watching movie in Amazon Prime and Netflix ( The theater environment experience).Now I can enjoy thousands of activities that I will never be able to enjoy before. Free sky falling, under ocean, Northen Aurora lights, Seeing Penguin in Antartica, Machu Pichu, Jerusalem, Bethelhem, London, Paris,  and more. I can even record the scenes and take pictures in the ""Wander"" apps. Don't  buy the National Geographic apps, it is not worth it ( only 2 places to explore). You rather enjoy the free Traveling VR TV in Youtube and Oculus TV.  it also has browser to let you browse the internet just like your computer.  I don't mind that it needs facebook account. Just open a new one and set all privacies. Thank you Oculus and our Lord, GOD Jesus Christ, you had my our lives worth it to live.

",1.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2021","









  
  
    
  Don't buy this.  Wait or look at another vendor's offerings.Oculus PMs and GMs should have listened to those engineers and focus group customers that said that this was designed poorly, waited to release it and gone back to the drawing board (or CAD program).  The battery doesn't belong on the user's face.  It should have been put on the back of the head because the weight of the headset is all on the forehead and cheekbones.  I tried a few solutions to this, including wearing a bump cap underneath with a string lifting the weight from the side arms, getting an upgraded, aftermarket solid strap, face pads,etc.  Nothing relieved the weight without causing the headset to move around while I was playing.Not all of us have a beautifully bulb shaped skull, so you can't rely solely on the strap to cradle your head.I have a Rift also.  I can play for hours in the unit.  I can only stand the Quest for about 15 minutes.

  There’s a lot of things about the oculus that I can rave on about. I’ll start with the pros- when you start it up (after initial set up) you create a barrier,or guardian. For while you’re on VR. The PSVR doesn’t have this. So you will bump into things during usage. There’s a lot of great apps with the oculus that are a lot of fun. I hope more will be added soon. Everything that was wrong with the oculus quest 1, was fixed with the 2. There’s this great option where you can share your experience on a mobile device. My kids like watching me do Beat Saber on multiplayer.It’s quite user friendly, even for me who isn’t the most tech savvy.Now the cons. The head strap doesn’t fit well, and getting the elite head gear costs extra. Battery life is only about 2  hours.You have to pair the oculus with your Facebook account. I don’t really like this. Because if something happens to your Facebook account, you get locked out of your oculus, and It becomes a worthless piece of junk.Aside from those things, the oculus quest 2 is affordable and has a lot of options for games and other apps to explore and immerse yourself in to get the full VR experience.Update: after using the oculus for about a month now, all the glitches people have been talking about are now starting to occur.The glitchy defect right controller.The tracking can’t really keep up when I play Beat Saber on some of the faster maps. I thought by upping it from 50hz to 60hz, the problem would be resolved.I still dealt with glitches from the right controller. The saber would just float away, or stop working.I’d recommend a more robust system if you’re a serious gamer, or looking to go into expert mode on beat saber. The oculus quest 2 is good for casual play.

  Thrilled with my oculus 2.  I highly recommend it.  The graphics are great.  Fun experience.  You only need what’s in the box.  Nothing else.  No computer, just the headset and two hand controllers.  You can bring it anywhere and set it up for hours of fun with friends.  You can also cast to a tv so people can see what the player is seeing.Love the shooter games.  Beat Saber is really good exercise.  I’m always sweaty and breathing heavy when I’m done.I got the less expensive one; I’m not a gamer so the 64GB is perfect for me.  It does get a little uncomfortable on my head after playing for a long time. The oculus 1 came with a different strap that holds the headset in place more comfortably.  Clearly they changed is so they could make the oculus 2 less expensive.  An upgraded strap similar to the one on the original is available but it is $50, which is steep for a couple of pieces of plastic.Also, I ordered and returned the Oculus 2 case that is made by oculus.  You can see my review on that.  $50, cheaply made, and didn’t provide good protection.  I’m still looking for a good, economical case option.I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to get a VR headset.  It does not disappoint, plus you don’t need anything except what comes in the box.  That’s the best part.  You can also watch immersive VR videos and movies.  Or just watch movies on it and feel like you’re in a theatre looking at a giant screen.

  Motion Tracking = amazingcontrollers = durable (i accidentally dropped mine multiple times onto concrete)headset = small, comfortable, and durable with around 3 hours of battery life (your eyes don't need anymore than that and you can also charge it while playing if you have the right extension cords)You can adjust the eyesight to fit people with glasses and it worked for everyone in my house.There are a variety of games and a test game so you know what you're doing, I bough superhot, job simulator, and Walking Dead: Saints and SinnersI highly recommend buying Superhot and Job simulator first, as they are simple games and good introductions. My family loved playing job simulator as well.The games are super cool, I love Walking Dead VR, its just too much fun. If you want you can connect this to a pc (as long as it can handle good games) and then play some games that AREN'T on the oculus quest 2 yet and are on steam.Just so you know, you need a Facebook account to sign up. You do not need a phone to play, just to set it up. If you're worried about privacy, or getting banned and losing all your games, then create a fake account like me. I created just some random account and stored my stuff on there. No privacy problems.15/10

  I can’t seem to find a good ipd setting. Unsure if it’s related or not, but the lens have concentric rings in them- not saying that’s the problem- the problem is that I can always see light halos reflecting off of some of those rings within my screen field of view. Therefore, there’s a halo effect during every second of playtime, which becomes exceptionally distracting to the point of me quitting whatever it is I’m doing because I can’t stand it any longer. Not even sure that I won’t just send this back for a refund at this point. I certainly don’t recommend it to anyone who’s on the fence.

  I wanted a vr headset for the longest time but could never justify buying one if I had to be strapped to the computer. This thing is amazing, I can play my pc games in vr now but I can also go to the living room and play all the standalone oculus games with no cords attached. I didn’t get the last quest because I didn’t think I would like the resolution on it. The screen looks amazing on here, one major problem though is the battery life. Two hours is fine for myself but when playing with other people it really sucks. I would love to get the elite strap with the extra battery on it but that is kind of hard to get at the moment since they are sold out everywhere. One other problem is that the headset DOES NOT stay charged or chrages while you are using it. This is a major problem since this will ultimately effect the battery life of the system and from what everyone is saying on the internet, will cause damage over time. Hopefully there is an update for this issue in the future. I mostly use it as a standalone right now because I’m scared that if I connect it to my pc to play those games in vr that while it is connected and charging that it will damage the headset. If these issues could be fixed in the future then this will most definitely be a 5 star review but for now the headset isn’t really performing as expected.

  I got this after wanting, and trying, several of the original VR headsets. I have always been interested in VR but the price to performance was never good enough to justify buying my own. This was until I tried my buddies Quest 1. I then decided it was time. I ordered the Quest 2 256 gb model and was not disappointed. Of course the Facebook thing is absolutely awful and I hate it, but I have an account that I'm almost never on and I figured having one footprint in the social world wouldn't kill me, and, honestly, I've had no issues with it to date. Now I'll list some pros and cons after my first week of use.Pros:-Its a lot more comfortable than people make it out to be-Battery life isn't awful considering I don't use it for more than a few hours at a time (rebuff reality battery pack on the way)-The display is pretty clear but my IPD is about 60 so that's a bummer-Its very light so my neck doesn't get too worn out with extended use-I love the guardian system and passthrough feature-Controllers track really well considering the lack of lighthouse modules-The user interface is really easy to use-Its also built like a tank (already dropped it :()Cons:-The regular headstrap is okay definitely not as bad as people say though-The controller wrist straps will not keep you from throwing them-The hand tracking feature is a bit spotty and unreliable-The white shell of the headset and controllers will pick up every little scuff and scratch if you hit something-The foam interface will soak up sweat like nothing else so sharing with friends can be quite gross-The included interface also seems to pop out quite easily after pulling it out the first time so be aware of thatConclusion:I can not be happier with my purchase and the slight flaws are more than reasonable given the price. It seems you are really just paying for better hardware rather than a hefty shell. If you don't mind selling your soul to facebook, it's a great place to start!!

  The Oculus Quest 2 is easily a 5 star device hands down.  I removed 1 star due to the Facebook link. I recently commented on an agriculture Facebook Page that I thought an genetically altered apple was “ugly” and I was banned from Facebook for 24 hours claiming I violated their community standards for verbal abuse. So be aware this before purchasing.  Because of the ban I couldn’t use the Quest 2 for 24 hours.As I stated in the title of my review the Quest 2 is utterly amazing. Wow was the only word I have to describe my initial reaction when I first used the headset. It’s great entertainment, providing you with a futuristic altered reality beyond the imagination. If you’ve been to Universal Studios, Disney or any of the Orlando Theme Parks and went on Spider Man, Back To The Future, etc then this is for you. It tricks the mind into believing you’re actually there experiencing whatever game you have to purchase. Besides games YouTube has a a huge virtual reality section I never new existed.The devise itself is easy to setup in 5 minutes. YouTube has several tutorials that will assist with the many features that Oculus offers.Yes I highly recommend the Oculus Quest 2 for all age groups because it has so much to offer from Physical Fitness, games for all ages, YouTube, Netflix, the internet, Television, and so much more.

  Truth be told I returned this.  I did because I had issues with being able to see with my glasses.  You can get prescriptions for the glasses I hear, and there is a glasses adjustment but I had issues with some of the things in the menu and being able to read it.  It was more the smaller print they needed me to read.I didn't like the way they had me adjust the headset.  It never felt like I had it on perfectly, just okay.  The experience itself is amazing.  I liked how you could set up boundaries for you to play in, and if you stepped out of it the outside camera would turn on and you could see where you were in relation to the play field.  I wish there was an option to turn on the camera at any time.The controllers were nice.  The game would often show you where your hands were and where they were in the VR world.The biggest problem is the Oculus store.  Everything there is too expensive, and demos were more of a rarity then you might expect.  Unlike the PS store, and even the Vive the sales for these games hardly were on sale.  I saw multiple sales on steam, and even humble for VR games.  Nothing was ever compatible with the Quest.You might have heard that you need a facebook account to access this, and it's true.  I didn't care about them having access to this, since I hardly ever use facebook...however I can see this being an issue for people.If you want a standalone VR system.  This is the best your going to do...however if you own a PS4 you might want to look into the PSVR.I did end up buying one game for it.  Superhot VR ($24.99)...that game was really good.  I liked how you could duck behind cover and if you stopped moving you could plan your attack.  The game only moved when you did, that's the gimmick behind it.  If you do end up buying this, try this games demo.

  So far I’m loving my new quest 2. It’s smaller and lighter than my old quest and I ordered with the Elite Strap which is amazing btw in terms of comfort compared to the OG quest it’s soooo much better by leaps and bounds trust me you don’t need to buy the elite strap with battery pack unless you want to charge it for extra playing time but if it’s just for comfort the regular $50 elite strap is amazing no more VR face! I can play with comfort for a long time without getting those ugly marks on my face also I was thinking I would need a VR cover but the stock one is perfect! Also it turns on much faster and everything loads much easier it’s definitely worth it and I already had a FB account so that’s never been an issue for me I got nothing to hide! Also with the elite strap you can loosen up the black strap on top so it doesn’t even touch your hair which is awesome if you got styled hair or what not no more squashed up VR hair lol

    Honest Review - Some good, some bad
  
",4.0,RDE,"Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2021","









  
  
    
  I don't write a lot of reviews, but felt like I could write something that would help someone like me decide whether this is right for them and their family or not.  I have two boys, 13 and 11.  We bought it for Christmas.  This was our first VR purchase and I have some friends that have other PC based systems, but that seemed too complicated for my kids to really enjoy.The good.It's easy to setup and pretty much gets going right out of the box.  Couple of free things are included to show off the capabilities.  First, the graphics are decent.  I've not tried anything that requires amazing graphics, but their decent.  Not like a high end PC, but it feels very immersive.  The hand and head tracking is amazingly spot on.  It's easy to get immersed in what you're playing and you really do feel like you're in another world.The battery life is fine.  The first day it stayed low because we didn't want to stop and charge it.  Would've been nice if the battery was full when we got it, but that's a minor annoyance.  Since then we've not been in a situation where the battery died, it's outlasted us.  Maybe because we only play it for 30-60 minutes at a time at most, then just plug it back it.The not-so-good:The games are pretty weak.  No major titles are available.  The games are generally cheaper at $20-$30, but I've not been impressed by most of them.  They all feel like ""extended demos"".  The notable exception being Beat Saber.  That's fun, but has weak multiplayer and not much of a solo campaign, so just depends on how much you like listening to the same ~30 songs (up to about 60 if you buy all the extra packs, but then you're in  for about $100 total to the game).We've downloaded other popular games.  They have all felt really short.  Like 2-3 hours of playtime for $25.  Meh.  Vader Immortal looks really cool, but it's boring, and 75% of the game is just watching cut scenes or slowly walking somewhere.  The dojo practice is really fun, but no multiplayer and no real campaign, just killing droids and stormtroopers.Super Hot is also fun, but same thing.  2-3 hours of game play and it's $20.  Space pilot trainer is similar, shoot a bunch of things in single player.We really struggled with the Facebook integration thing as our kids aren't on social media.  Eventually we decided to skirt the rules and just attach it to my wife's facebook account (she's the only one that has one).  That worked pretty easily.  This brings up something kind of annoying.  Oculus seems totally designed to work with one person, not a family.  It doesn't support different profiles or different saved games like any other game system I've ever seen.  So if someone beats a level and the other person comes in to play, they start where the other left off.Summary:So here we are, 2 weeks after Christmas and it's pretty much just sitting in the corner now.  It was definitely fun for a week or so, but the lack of compelling games is really the problem.  Games feel like they are written to exploit one new thing that makes them cool.  Super Hot has it where time only moves when you do.  Space pirates has a nifty shield you can hide behind.So we spend $300 on the Oculus and another $100 or so on games.  That's a lot for a week of entertainment.Personally, I think VR is neat, but I think that's about it.  It's neat, but I don't necessarily want to be stuck standing in the middle of my room for a couple hours while I play a game.  And there's only so many things you can do with hand/head gestures that are compelling in a game.I'm glad we bought it to play around with and we had fun for the first week or two. But at this point feel like it was too expensive for what we got out of it.  And I'm really hesitant to spend any more money on the games because they're not worth the money just to play for a few hours.  Ultimately that's the killer.  I find we want to play in VR, but don't want to play any of the games we have, and nobody (including my kids) wants to spend their money on any more of the games that are available.So I would recommend to everyone out there to wait until major game companies start to release titles on VR.  That's probably the time to jump in and spend the money.

  This is honestly a amazing headset. Sure its not the fanciest in some areas but its amazing price and unparalleled ability to play games not only wirelessly and without a pc is amazing.Some people might be turned off by the requirement of Facebook but, even though I am not a fan of Facebooks previous conduct related to data privacy, the fact of the matter is that if you use Amazon, Mastercard, or Google. That's not going to do anything. Companies sell data to each other all the time, and if your strategy was just not using Facebook it isn't going to work anyways.

  As per Amazon's request I shall focus on my experience with this product only and ignore any shipping issues:Packaging :  The product's packaging is pleasing to the eye and opens up fairly easily , yet curiously the debris under the shrink-wrap detracted from the unboxing experience of the product.Inside the Box : The device itself seemed to be carefully placed along with the controllers and a small box containing power adapter and the instructions , very nice except for scratches on the plastic that are very visible , also in the interior of the HMD.Cleaning: I feel that due to the very likely possibility of this being a used product , I need to clean it to avoid contracting any possible eye or dermal infection yet I could not find clear instructions about how to remove the foam spunge part of the visor and I would probably have to purchase a cover to that effect which would cost me more money.Use : For now I am not able to put it on an use it because as I've said : I need to clean it first. Will update later.Overall : So far its a disappointing product which also a appears to be a possible disease vector . Box could use better sealing and tamper proofing.  and its a pity because I've seen users online which seem to really enjoy this product, maybe they got lucky with better quality control.

  I tested a friend's Oculus Rift and thought it was the best thing ever. The image quality was very clear and was amazed by the overall performance.I looked on Amazon and noticed the newest version of Oculus was being released and decided to make the big purchase of Oculus Quest 2.It has been a great disappointment. The text comes in crystal clear, but everything else is blurry. I become slightly dizzy and have to stop after 10 minutes.I’ve read many trouble shooting blogs regarding this common problem and nothing works. I am learning more from various online reviews that this is a persistent problem with this specific model.I would recommend buying a different model that has a proven track record. Now I have a very expensive paper weight.

    Pretty amazing with some compromises
  
",4.0,Joseph D. Land,"Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  I started with a PSVR and transitioned to a launch Rift S.  At the time, I passed on the Quest just because I wanted the best VR experience.  I played around with it yesterday and I think this Quest 2 is pretty amazing although I think they might have gone just a little too far with the compromises.For starters, the screen looks crisp and sharp and it's pretty amazing that they fit all this tech in such a small device.  I played Beat Sabre and it was honestly just as good as on my PC/Rift S, but actually better considering there are no more wires.  Other games like ""Until you fall"" were so much better to play without a wire as is ""Superhot"", Robo Recall and Saints and Sinners even if the graphics are downgraded.  It's worth the trade off.I was prepared to HATE the audio but it's serviceable for what it is.  Your best experience is to throw on a good set of headphones, but working out to beat sabre is more than adequate with the speakers.  I was presently surprisedNow on to the slight issues and suggestions:I guess, I'd say that if you have a PC and can tolerate wires, the Rift S is right now the best value for the money. Playing wireless does make a huge difference, but at the same time properly managed wires with a pulley system and cord extensions work so well you will rarely notice them outside of specific games.Where you start to have slight issues is that the Headset is affordable, but with all the extras you'll need to buy, again, it may be a better value to buy a Rift S and wait for the next version of the quest- The headstrap is very weak so you will need to purchase the elite strap.  That adds another 50 bucks, it's worth the money but the headset still doesn't feel as comfortably as the rift S.- If you do want to connect to a computer, the official oculus link is a whooping 80 dollars which seems flat out absurd to me.- If you have glasses, even with the spacer in the quest 2, your glasses are dangerously close to the lens and you might scratch you glasses and lenses which would be a HUGE HUGE cost.  So you will probably need to buy lens inserts. The Rift S is absolutely perfect for glasses, there's plenty of room between lenses but this doesn't seem to be the case on the quest. For the quest, BE SURE to buy the lens protector rings that clip onto the lens and protect you from expensive scratches.- Carrying cases and battery packs are also going to be extra costs.- The Subtraction of the IPD slider also seems like a critical setback and they removed the nice cloth lining which would have been nice to keep on.I get what they were trying to do.  They worked hard to get the cost down to an incredible place but I almost wish there could have been a pro model that was a little higher end.So I'm not saying the headset isn't amazing and excellent, I'm just saying if you have even a moderately decent PC and a play space you may want to get a little more life out of the Rift since it's been discontinued and is on its way out.  Use that for a couple years and go for the next Quest Model.If you don't have a PC or you want a stand alone device I can't stress enough how awesome this thing is.  It really impressed me, I just think they might have went a bit too far with the compromises

  I’ve owned the original Vive and this is a huge upgrade. The tracking, resolution, size, weight, and quality are all amazing for the price. Being fully wireless and portable makes this such a huge advancement over PC tethered headsets. It also has an excellent microphone which is great for games like VRChat. If it’s financially possible for you I do highly recommend the elite strap (with battery!) and the link cable. The battery drains quickly (around 2 hours play) and the link cable will allows you more performance when it’s needed.

  I’m over 50 and for the most part hate gaming as I think it’s a huge waste of time and causing our youth to lose any sense of creativity among many other things. When my fiancé came home and said she had a played it at a friends home and it was incredibly fun and a good workout I decided to buy one for her. She’s got to play once lol. OMG it’s such a blast and I’m so sore 2 days later from the workout I got. I purchased Beat saber and a boxing game. What a true workout as I boxed like I was in a real ring with an opponent and I whipped him good too! Lol. My dad was a boxer so I was raised with a few good combinations and know how to shuffle my feet. Then I took a tour to Dubai and went t clubbing in Tokyo. They mix a drink and set it in front of you and it’s so realistic (3D) you wanna pick the drink up. It has a calorie counter and I set my goal at 150 just for starters. Playing beat saber and ind of dancing to the music as I played Hans Solo I burned 150 calories in matter of minutes. Trust me your never to old to enjoy something this cool. You can even surf the web on it. It’s like having a big 80” screen floating in front of you. BUY IT!!  You won’t regret it. I also advise getting some face coverings because you’ll sweat so much (if you want too and play the games). Too much fun for sure. There’s a learning curve if your not a gamer and I learn a little more each time I use it. Haven’t really found a manual but I’m more of a jump in and swim kind of guy anyway so I’m doing fine learning it. My only regret is Facebook owns it and I have a lot of disdain for Zuckerberg and most of the tech titans that are pushing their influence on this wonderful country.

  Facebook/Oculus should be ashamed.  If it was possible to give a zero start rating, I would.  Bought this for my son's birthday and it stopped working on Christmas day.  The headset is stuck in a boot loop and will not connect via Bluetooth nor connect with USB to computer for manual reset.  Factor reset by holding buttons on the headset will not work either.  After emailing with Oculus/Facebook customer service and getting repeated responses from multiple agents, we've decided to return this back through Amazon.  This is also a pretty widespread and known issue! It seems like the run-around we were getting was due to the fact, we had 2 days left with Amazon before it could not be returned.

  I purchased the Oculus Quest 2 to replace my aging HTC Vive that I purchased several years ago. Overall, the Quest 2 is a decent upgrade. I immediately noticed the superior visual clarity of the Q2 over the original Vive. The best thing is the easy setup. The Vive had a lot of cables to connect and/or plug such as hdmi, usb, lots of power plugs due to base stations and what not, and etc. It was always a nuisance. But with the Quest 2 there is none of that. Just the headset and two controllers. A huge improvement. Plus, it can be connected to PC for PCVR games. I wirelessly connected my Quest 2 to my PC and was able to stream my old Steam VR games from the PC to the Quest 2 and play, without any cables connected, no problem. Yes, no cables at all. It was great! The best way to experience room-scale for sure is by being untethered. And on top of that, the self-contained Quest games on the Oculus store are not bad either! You can play anywhere.

    Cheap headset with bad design and cheap material
  
",1.0,Arthur Hau,"Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2021","









  
  
    
  This is basically a cell phone mounted on a CHEAP $30 buck headset without any cell phone function. The controller has no grip. The headset is too narrow. If you have a medium-large sized head and wear glasses, chances are you will constantly feel deep pain on two sides of you head. The rigid plastic on the two sides of the headset will press hard on the two arms of your glasses. The headset puts a ton of pressure on our cheek bone cause it is front-loaded. You need to spend a ton of money to buy head strap, face pad, controller grip,... The battery charge extremely slowly. Charging time is the same as playing time. You need to spend money either in buying a longer USB wire or an expensive power bank. There is no way you can expand your RAM. You can use sidequest to add memory to it but you cannot store games in the external memory cause your Quest 2 will not recognize the game on your external memory. My Quest 2 had one very bad lens that is blurry with something like a piece of white cloud in it. Even without this defect, the sweet spots of the two lens are extremely narrow. If you move your eyes without moving your head, things will become off focus very quickly. Sound quality is not comparable to other headsets. So, you need to buy some more expensive headstraps with better ear phones. By paying $299, you end up paying over $200 extra on upgrades and replacement. The only strength of this device is that it is wireless. But if you don't use wire connection, you can't really play VR games on a high end PC without lags (say using virtual desktop). That means you need to spend some more money to buy a longer cable, or the results may not be satisfactory for some games. If you buy this for your kids, it is still OK cause most games available are old or childish VR games with very simplistic and/or reduced graphics quality. If you want to play some serious AAA VR games, like VR sim racing, you simply cannot because of the serious lack of RAM and the lack of a functional graphics CPU. This device is for first time VR players. Just don't do any upgrades or replacement. Wait for the VR gaming market to improve in a year or two. Then buy something with much higher quality at only a little higher cost.

    Having used other VR products, I'm Amazed
  
",5.0,mrbigglezworth,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  VR Background: I've owned two generations of the Samsung Gear VR (also running Oculus) as well as used the HTC Vive in the past.I have to say, this is the first VR product that I've used that makes me think the technology has reached maturity. Everything about this is iteratively better than previous VR devices I've used and the areas that show the most improvement are the pain points of previous devices.Screen: The screen is great. The resolution and pixel layout have almost entirely removed the screen door effect that was distractingly apparent on the Gear VR and HTC Vive. The 90hz refresh rate (turned on in the ""Experimental  Features"" menu is truly a game changer. I was able to play for several hours straight (trust me, you won't want to take this device off) without any eye fatigue or dizziness. The only thing lacking is the true black levels of OLED panels, but the slight grey-ness of the LCD is a small trade-off for all of the benefits.Controllers: Also incredibly well implemented. They are extremely light-weight, but don't feel cheap. Tracking is phenomenal and I like the trigger, joystick, and button placement. They are intuitive and comfortable to use for hours.Play space: Wow. The way you trace out your room-scale play space is so well conceived and implemented. The ""Guardian Box"" unobtrusively fades in when you get close until you are touching it in which it turns into a visual barrier. Once through it, the cameras turn on and you are able to see your surroundings, so make it a bit tighter so you don't end up walking into a wall or couch.The two things that really made me feel it was time to buy a ""real"" VR devices are the ability to tether to a computer for full-featured VR gaming, and the price. Don't get me wrong, this headset is completely capable of doing almost anything you could want in its standalone form, but the ability to tether really gives you some peace of mind that as the device ages, or a game comes out that requires a PC to run (cough, Star Wars: Squadrons, cough) you have the option to delegate the heavy lifting to a dedicated computer. With a $299 price tag, if you've been wanting to enter in the the VR space, now is the time.

  Ok, if you have read online reviews of the Q2, then you may well know this headset does have some issues.That said, I am planning to buy one for my hubby and my daughter.If you compare to the Q1, then this one has better graphics, faster processor and is lighter.If you have never owned an Oculus headset or are new to VR, then this is a damn good introduction to it.You WILL need a Facebook account to login to it. But there's your only real downside.If you're new to VR, GO SLOW! Games like Real VR Fishing, Nature Trek and Gun Club VR are good starters. If you start to feel ill, take a break from VR for an hour or 2 and try again.That said, the Q2 (Quest 2) is the fastest and best looking headset currently on the market. It is a stand alone unit AND can work as a PCVR as well (using a USB c or link cable). There are also work around that allow you to run it wirelessly from ur computer as well.For $299 for 64 GB, it's a steal of a deal!

  ok had both quest 1 now this, i will point out the noticable improvements and downgradesPros:-More comfortable than the quest 1 for sure. Even with the stock strap the reduced weight and new design is a big upgrade less strain on your face and neck. Still kinna front heavy tho so many will prefer a different strap but i like that you can lay down comfortably with the included strap which isnt the case with other straps.- Resolution and colors are improved and almost no sde now- More powerful and everything is much smoother, and things load way faster- controllers are better, more comfortable in hand, better vibration feedback, and longer battery life- audio is a little better than last quest but still has room for improvement, headphones still way betterCons:- Biggest con by far i immediately noticed: horrible god rays/glare around white text. Soooo distracting whenever reading text and this is a downgrade from the quest 1 which wasnt this bad.- ipd, not an issue for me as  i fit in smallest setting but if you are in the biggest setting. Be warned. u will see vertical bars on the side and you will loose fov. like looking through a box. Not sure i would buy if i had that ipd- included charging cable kinna sux as is short so cant use it as link cable like quest 1 cableThats it those are for me the noticeable improvements, and downgrades from original quest. For the price i think it is worth it and yes you sacrifice a few things but imo the sacrifices are worth it for the improvements.

  I was excited to purchase a Quest 2 after owning an original Quest.  Overall performance and resolution is expectedly better than the original.  Lighter weight is nice, although a counterweight is needed so it's not so heavy on my face.Unfortunately the facial interface is a lot more narrow than the original Quest.  I have a larger head, and the original Quest fit my face perfectly.  The Quest 2 facial interface digs into my cheek bones and gives me a headache pretty quickly.Oculus does sell a Fit  Pack for $40 that won't ship until late November.  I'm VERY disappointed that I have to wait nearly two months and have my wallet gouged for a piece of foam/plastic before I can use my Quest 2.

",3.0,Andrew S,"Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  VR is immersive, surreal, and there is nothing like it. However, over a year from the original Quest the content is just meh. Sure, you can install VR desktop and get access to AAA titles on Steam IF you have a gaming PC and a capable wifi router. Facebook is actively making this harder to do and is trying to restrict access to content outside of Oculus but currently can still be side loaded. The quest by itself is only as good as the games and content you can play on it. Sure, you can buy the link cable for 80 dollars but reports indicate that performance is not up to par and VR desktop is still the preferred method of playing Steam games for most people. The gaming community is in a uproar over being forced to be bound by Facebooks terms of service which are generally not consumer friendly not to mention who knows what they are doing with your data in VR.The device itself is a step up from the previous Quest. The ""screen door effect"" is non-existent compared to the original Quest. In a way the device is more comfortable due to the lighter weight but I found the included strap to not be so comfortable and reports on the internet indicate that it is consistently breaking or cracking. So it's a trade off and doesn't really improve the fit over all. Of course, you can buy a different head strap from Oculus for 50 dollars. Thanks to the upgraded processor the Quest 2 did feel a bit snappier and games did seem to run better but it was hard to discern any actual graphical improvements in the game.For me, it's difficult to want to spend more than 30 minutes in VR. Playing Star Wars squadrons via Virtual Desktop was actually awesome but my body can't handle chasing tie fighters doing barrel rolls and loops in VR.  Does VR desktop work with playing Steam games? I can say wholeheartedly yes! Is it easy to use? Not really. The oculus controllers may or may not work effectively and your experience may vary depending on your router, network, and PC.The Quest 2 has A LOT going for it. I love VR. It's going to be the future of gaming but it is not mainstream yet. Facebooks reputation and business decisions corrupt a rather beautiful niche for gaming.

  This is my 3rd VR set.  I have PSVR and Rift.  I don't use those anymore.  The requirement of sensors really discourage my use.  Since sensor setup means I am fix to use the device at a particular place.  With Quest 2, now I can use VR anywhere.  The resolution is also much better than what I have.  I have an 100"" theater, but now I rather watch movie with Quest 2, the screen is much bigger.  Just like going to a Grand Theater.  Some apps can play 3D with incredible clarity.The price is right at $299.  However, to be more comfortable, you need the Elite Strap, sweat proof cover, and extended batteries.  That's easily another $100 to $200 more.  64G is enough for casual user, but if you are going to download from STREAM, sidequest, and 3D movies, than you need the 256G version.

  My Quest 2 is suffering from the Buzzing sound coming from an internal cooling fan. Im now waiting on a second unit as a replacement. That being said, I love my quest two. It does everything relatively well and a great entry level Headset. The build quality at first glance was great, only issue being a buzz that completely eliminates the immersion of an experience especially through the quieter scenes. Im hoping my second unit’s  the charm and functions as it should. Another Huge Negative is forcing a FaceBook account. Be warned, if you don't have a FB that you are constantly using or you plan to create an illegitimate account. They could possibly ban you. Ive been able to look past the juggernaut that is facebook data collection and still really enjoy my device. That being said the question of what is happening behind the scenes with whatever data FB decides to collect  is very uncomfortable. I personally have given Facebook up and had no plans to return. The fact that i cannot use an oculus account without  linking it to a FB is beyond frustrating. For that reason alone i have rated one star and plan on moving out of the oculus environment as soon as a competitor picks up the gauntlet. Ohh and my eye glass also has those sharp cut edges that look like broken glass others have mentioned as well.

I guess color dye cost too much money. (Cough...golden parachute...cough)The so called guardian can't be disabled (without jail breaking) this is inconvenient because the sensors are understandably limited.They sell this thing at a console price but it needs more work before I would consider it worth it.No one should be forced to log into the internet to play a console. An option for it is fine.

  The experience is amazing, its truly a full VR experience for $300. For $300, you get a headset which is powered by a processor that is practically a high end smartphone(equivalently powered phones can cost over $1000.) it has a high res display for each eye, and lenses, and 4 tracking cameras, AND fantastic two controllers! A few years ago something like this could cost $500-$1000 and it wouldn't be standalone(would require a PC).At this point I have shown it to several family members and the number of ""Wow""'s its gotten is exciting.That said, this has some issues that range from who cares, to major depending on who you ask.The bad lenses issue I didn't have, cant comment on it. From the sounds of it its happening less, and hopefully will go away entirely.The facebook issue I don't mind much since I don't use facebook.The issue that bothers me is the lack of account switching features, this could be the VR headset of the living room. since you cant swap between accounts, and many games dont have multiple saves it seems to mostly be for one person. This could be the sole family VR headset, there would be practically no competitors to it. Its such a shame too.

    Not a replacement for Rift
  
",2.0,Chance,"Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this headset because the specs looked good, the display I was told was amazing, and it was now possible to connect it to your PC to use it as a Rift headset for PC gaming.I was sold on the concepts, but so far I'm not sold on the actual product.Facebook requirements are not taken into account here, otherwise the score would be lower.My first impression was that the screen looks good, very little screen-door effect, and everything was bright and vibrant.  First time wearing the headset it required an update, but that is to be expected with technology anymore.  Pairing and setup were a breeze, absolutely no issues there.  Setting up Guardian boundaries was also very intuitive.As I continued to use the headset, my frustrations began to shine.I plugged the headset into my PC with a certified Oculus Link cable, and it worked.  Technically it worked.  The headset itself is capable of 90 Hz, but when in Rift it lowers that down to rates that make me almost feel nauseous but not quite.  The view when in Rift games on PC are absolutely horrible: Colors are washed out, textures are blurry, text is impossible to read in most instances, and in almost every aspect it feels like a downgrade from the original Rift system, which shouldn't be the case with this headset considering they are no longer producing Rift systems.  This is clearly Facebook trying to use a band-aid to patch up a severed limb: It will not do the trick.Another down is the controller tracking, I cannot put my hands down to my sides like I naturally do, otherwise the virtual hands go flying off or get stuck in limbo.  The external trackers on my original Rift system are so much better, and this feels like a complete downgrade to the tracking system.  When I hold my hand in position with the Quest headset, my hand twitches and moves around even though my physical controller is not moving, this was never an issue with my original Rift system with external trackers.Additionally, the headset weight is insanely front-heavy and requires a different strap if you plan to use it more than ten to fifteen minutes at a time, which I normally do with my original Rift.Conclusion:  This is NOT a replacement for Rift, this is a downgrade from Rift.  If you don't PC game you may find enjoyment in this headset, but if you do play PC VR, you need to find a different system as Oculus is no longer Oculus.  Overall, I cannot recommend this headset (at least while still at full price).

  Bought one as a Christmas present for my (over 13) child. It requires a Facebook account to use, so on Christmas went to create an account for them so they could use it. Immediately upon completing the sign-up wizard, the account was ""disabled"" for ""violating Community Standards"", which is clearly impossible since they are just creating an account. The only recourse is to provide some personal information (such as a photo and a mobile verification, which in and of itself is pretty invasive and problematic since it's for a 13-year-old) and then wait for a team of people to review the account manually and hopefully, maybe, unlock it at some point. Tried creating one for myself as well with my e-mail just to get them rolling, same result.So at this point we've paid for a $300 product that can't be used, until some future point potentially when some person might allow us to use the product. If this was for myself I would immediately return it, but my child has had their heart set on it so we'll wait. Can't give this product few enough stars though. It's literally unusable except as a table decoration.

  Unfortunately, the Amazon page isn't smart enough to realize that 0 stars IS a selected star rating.After taking forty minutes to even begin trying to set up.  The device was uncomfortably small.  As a big guy with glasses and a big head this was designed for children even though the minimum age was 13.The connection USB cable DOESN'T WORK.  It constantly loses connection no matter what you do.  For five minutes, the most reliable game I could play on it was ""you're connected to a PC"" ""Connection lost"".  Followed by ""It's too dark in your brightly lit room to track"".  Great games.Setting it up uses 65% of the battery power even while it's connected to charge.Whatever idiot thought that this piece of cell-phone based garbage would EVER replace a PCVR system should not only be fired, they should be removed from any position to ever make decisions affecting anyone, including themselves, as they obviously can't be trusted to think more than one step ahead.Some major issues.  All of the buttons are exactly where you need to hold the visor to move it.  Power off.  If you're not one of the incredibly trendy, fit, small-framed people they show using it, you won't be able to.  It's not designed for the masses, it's designed for trendy hipsters, who wouldn't want it.  If you've EVER used a PC based VR system you will find this an incredible let down.Here's hoping the government splits up Farcebook so they have to let someone with a clue work on the Oculus.I picked up both the Rift S and the Quest 2.  I'll keep the Rift S as it works and will be returning this POS tonight.  Sorry, Amazon.TL;DR:  Don't waste your time.  Get a PCVR system.  It will be a much, much better experience.

I get massive headaches from this, and it struggles to play vrchat which was the main reason i got it.

I had so many problems trying to install the sync app on my PC. On the headset itself the guardian was so annoying, it would ask me to set up my ""space"" everytime I turned the headset on. If I ignored this I would keep seeing these red lines everywhere. Also I HATE that facebook made this thing so limited where you can only play games that facebook selected. You can follow a guide where they (not facebook) give you 20 steps to be able to sideload a game, it's a very hacky way. Omg what a turn off that was.Thank god for hassle free returns.

  Honestly I love this system. I've had it for a couple days now and it works like a dream. I would say that it is indeed a great system to introduce you to VR and has a wide array of impressive pros to relatively few cons. Yes you do need to have a facebook account but honestly there is no such thing as online privacy so you'd probably be best to stop thinking anything you do isn't being tracked or recorded somewhere. The tracking for the headset and handset is superb, probably the best I've ever seen for a non sensor box VR. I'd say you could only really notice it if you have a sensor box VR system, other than that it's pretty spot on. Won't track in dark areas which isn't that big an issue but still you should be aware. I do wish there was a more granular eye spacing set up as the 3 do indeed cover most people but sometimes just the very edge is blurry and it gets to wear on your eyes after a bit. Some of the apps I wish had an easier way to position yourself but that's not the headset's fault it's more the fault of the app. Batteries in the handsets last a super long time. I can't complain much about the headset battery life either because, honestly, it's pretty good for the clarity and speed it's playing the games at. You get about a couple hours per charge but you can plug it in to a wall socket and play indefinitely with a long enough USB-C cable. Though, I would caution about extended play sessions if you don't have the exact right focal setup because it can start to hurt your eyes, 2 hours is about the max I've been able to stand myself. Honestly I (who own every game system since the NES) consider this to be one of the most fun and best system purchases I've made since the N64. I love the multiple environments and the general flexibility of this machine, being able to play steam games super nice with an attached cable, and having other games that load right onto the headset. I love it. I honestly recommend, if you don't have a VR setup and are looking for one that works great but isn't super expensive or confusing, just get this one. If they come up with any really stupid requirements or gotcha's then I'll update this review but so far I'm loving this headset and so is the rest of my family.

  If, like me, you were considering the Quest 2 as an upgrade to the Oculus Go, it is not.  It is a step down from everything that headset does well. The Quest 2 does not natively support DLNA streaming, so if you're used to watching content from your own home server/PC, you can't.  There are third party apps available to do this, but at the cost of reduced video quality (poorer frame rate).Ergonomically it's a huge step down also.  It's heavy, and impossible to keep attached to your face unless you tighten the straps so tight that it's painful.  The headset is also narrower, so if you wear glasses, they don't really fit into the eye area, even with the included glasses adapter installed.Long story short, if intend to use this for media streaming, it fails on all counts.  This will not be the VR headset for you.Also, you probably know this already, but it requires a Facebook account to use the headset, which should have been a deal breaker in itself.  As in, you literally cannot use the headset in anyway without a Facebook logon.

    Great headset, decent privacy options
  
",5.0,H. Wang,"Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was concerned about the privacy issues associated with Facebook prior to buying this headset. I took a look at the EULA and what I'd have to do to activate the headset and I've been decently satisfied with it. While you do need a Facebook account, it is only used to login to your Oculus upon first activation. You don't have to use Facebook, ever, and it never asks you to login again.There's also options to keep your username, activity, and friends private. They have you configure this right at the start as well - no having to go into settings and search for it after. They don't record your data and everything on the Oculus side can be set to private.As for the headset itself, it's a little uncomfortable with the default strap. I'd highly recommend getting either the elite strap or a counterweight to offset the heaviness of the HMD. The overall experience itself is excellent. The image is clear and the tracking is excellent. The headset is sturdy and well made, and it looks like a lot of thought went into the consumer experience.Unless you are vehemently anti-social media I would definitely recommend a buy here. Other high-quality alternatives are the Valve Index (which is not as simple as the quest so take note). The first time you experience high-quality VR, it's really a game-changer in the literal sense of the word.

  We received our Oculus Quest 2 on January 6, 2021.  It is February 18th, 2021 now and I am already extremely frustrated with the thing.  It was great when we first got it.  No problems at all.  I was a little peeved that the headset’s battery only lasted for about an hour, but with the quality of the graphics this thing has, I can’t say that I’m surprised.  The problem can be easily solved by just buying an extra battery pack and rigging it to the back of the head strap.  By the way, the head strap that comes with it seemed fine at first, but I started getting headaches after playing it for more than 20 minutes, so I suggest you just get one of the hard plastic ones, if not the Oculus brand head strap (that actually has an extra battery pack).Ok, so why do I want to throw the damn thing into the street and let my neighbor’s girlfriends drive over it back and forth while practicing parallel parking on a nearly empty street (this is actually a hilariously common thing for them), you ask?  It’s because that awesome good time playing the Oculus turned into pure unadulterated frustration while playing the Oculus in less than 1 month!!!  My favorite game is Beat Saber.  I noticed that I actually get my heart rate high enough to count towards exercise minutes, according to my Apple iWatch, and I am a person who loathes cardio.  So, in order to get some exercise in and actually enjoy it, I paid for the extra songs (because I, nor any other 38 year old person I know enjoys dubstep “music”) and just play Beat Saber for 30 - 45 minutes.  I mean I USED to do that.  Now I’m lucky to get 20 minutes into playing it on the Hard and Expert levels (or any level for that matter) before one of the hand controllers loses tracking and goes floating off above my head (in the game), and then I lose and can’t play anything else because I can’t get it back on track unless I turn the whole thing off.When it first started happening (about 2 weeks after we got it), I noticed that it would lose tracking every 30 minutes, but it would only lose tracking for a few seconds and come right back every time.  Not really a big deal, but about 4 weeks into playing it, it started happening every 30 minutes and I wouldn’t be able to get it back on track without restarting the headset. I changed the batteries and made sure they were actually 1.5 volt AA batteries and yes they were new.  I also tried playing the Oculus at different locations with different lighting, and areas with different ranges of contrast between the objects in the room (higher contrast objects helps the Oculus tracking apparently), but the tracking problem seems to be getting worse by the day.If you try to research the issue online, you will find that this seems to be a common problem for people.  However, all of the articles on the issue that I have found were from over a year ago and for the original Oculus, not the Oculus 2.  I also noticed that it seems that nobody has ever updated their posts about if the issue was ever fixed and how it was fixed.  With the way mine is working, I’d say that they obviously haven’t figured out the problem.  There’s a lot of things to try and see if it makes the problem better, but I’ve tried all of it and NOTHING has helped!!!  Right now, I feel like I blew over $600 (Oculus, better headset, silicone covers for controllers and headset, protective case, and several games we’ve purchased) on a worthless paperweight, and that really chaps my cheeks because, in case you haven’t heard, the only thing I am rich in is dirty laundry.I feel that I’m being pretty generous giving the thing 3 stars, but those are only for the amazing graphics and experience you get during the 15 minutes it’s actually working properly.

  Last Christmas I bought one of the Oculus products for the grands, and we had to return them because their computer systems weren't compatible with the VR device. I actually forget at this point what the problem was exactly, but they had to go back.The Quest 2 doesn't have a compatibility problem with anything. One issue: one grand had gotten as far as setting up the app and account in his phone in the system we returned. We both (and I'm pretty techno for an old lady) had such a difficult time getting his former account to register the new Quest 2, that he just started from scratch with a different eMail and different FB account. It was a project that shouldn't have been necessary.The other grand was starting from scratch and his Quest 2 was up and running in minutes.While the boys have used VR headsets on a few occasions, I had not and I am blown away by it! Enough that I actually want a system for myself. Video games, sure, I guess. Probably not so much for me. But I could live on the David Attenborough nature videos. Wearing the headset, you are there. You're in it. Pretty much all that's missing are the scents.As with other video setups, the grands can play against or with each other from different locations and different internet connections. They can also play against strangers and hear strangers and converse with strangers, but the ability to converse with strangers can be shut off for safety. And I highly recommend it. With that cut off, the grands are still able to converse with each other, however. I highly recommend that.There is plenty of free entertainment available, from videos to games. There are many games to buy, as well. They aren't cheap by the time you add a few on.For some games there is more activity involved using VR than using a standard video game system. If you're in the mountain climbing app, you have to physically move around or you won't be ""climbing,"" so that's more exercise than a kid would get sitting on the couch playing a video game. Not the same as climbing a tree, but our grands also climb trees so it doesn't worry me that they aren't ""outside"" because they are outside all the time.Bringing me to, unlike standard video game systems that are connected to power and can allow a kid to sit for endless hours playing video games, the VR headsets run on battery power and the battery doesn't last endlessly. It's like a built-in time limit. It takes about an hour for the device to recharge to full power, so that's an hour the kids can come to the table, have dinner, grunt a few nays or assents to others by way of ""conversation"" and then get back to their games. Or be distracted so they forget the games and do something else. Don't scoff. I've seen it happen!I'm sure some kids will attach a battery pack to extend playing time. But my grands aren't.Anyway, virtual reality headsets are fun and interesting, and open up the possibility of who knows what cool applications suitable to anyone in the family. I love it.

  Lets start by saying I'm actually very surprised with this VR. I am a PSVR player from the word go, so I decided what the hect lets give the wireless a real shot. I not at all disappointed.Lets start with set up, its very well explained in the beginning of set up what needs to be done. Takes about 15 to 20 to fully set up. You will be asked to download the Oculus app on your phone and connect a valid wifi source for the setting up process. Once both are completed it will ask you to connect to Facebook and add a payment source for future purchases.  Then you will set your boundaries to allow it to read floor to ceiling, then ask you to draw a line around your space so the device will only allow you to travel or move within the drawn area, if you step outside that zone the headset will switch to live view showing you your room in live view. Great thing there.Clarity and sound are fantastic for this, not as good as a wired headset, but not a huge noticlbe differents. Tracking and devie speed is superb, except for some of the games seem to need a lot larger of a boundry or you end up getting alot of grid lines showing while your playing because your to close to leaving that boundry. Its a huge destraction and pain in the but to get just right.Dont not be a bad ass on facebook, if your account is locked or gets blocked by facebook, you now have a personal paper weight, untill they decide to unlock your account. Basically it locks your headset device too so you cant use it at all untill said comment above.I personally think the games are over priced compared to the same games and prices on a PSVR system. Also if you wear glasses, it does come with a bumper to keep the lens from touching and scratching, but it does cause a bit of light in at the buttoms of the headset. Doesnt affect the immesrion as bad but its noticable.In all if you thinkk its right for you give it a shot. I dont think its worth the price tag when you have things like psvr avaible for the same price and better quality

Want to lower the brightness, got to put the device in Dev mode to do that and I believe that is out of reach for a lot of people. It kind of reminds of my cellphone on full brightness at night, its a bit much.This device is a great value. Thanks the the new cable connection you can now use it like any other wired headset (Oculus S).  Other than those it still has the same complaints as everybody else, controllers too smooth and head band could be better.Also a warning: if you want hi quality fidelity that you see people playing on youtube this device won't really do that. The ability to render out polygons is really low. This problem can be solved by keeping it connected and playing through your computer.

  This was my first VR headset so this was a unique experience for me. The headset itself works great and is easily worth the 300 dollars asking price, although I have a few quibbles here and there.- Setup took around 4 hours. There was some difficulty with controllers and the headset died before I could use it.- The controller firmware needed to be updated. Maybe the help page could explain that?- Actually made me want to return it.- The strap is annoying, the headset keeps sliding down my face.- The screen gets blurry if you look at the edges while the headset is not on your face properly.- It would be nice if things on the store were cheaper. Maybe allow third party stores to sell keys?- Selection in the store is quite limited, maybe open it up some more, although it is nice to not see shovelware around.That being said I would still buy this headset again.

  First, I have to start off with saying I would rate 5 stars but I don’t like that it’s a required Facebook log-in device. Other reviewers complained about this but Facebook stated that under info section as well as on the box that you must have an account. I have watched and read many reviews about it prior to release date so I was well aware. If this is a deal breaker for you, then this is not the device for you.The product itself is great and the elite strap is a must have to help with weight distribution and comfort. I’m new to VR so this is a good way to start. I debated on the Rift but with Quest you can play both Oculus games and PC games with a Link cable (provided you have a computer that’s VR compatible). The 64GB version is good enough storage but if spending $100 extra isn’t a big deal, it’s worth the upgrade to 256GB and never have to worry about storage. This is a great alternative to just sitting and playing video games. This get you up and moving!

  In order to buy games for these you must set up an account with their store and agree to have them keep your credit card info or PayPal account information on file. There is no way to securely purchase without giving them Total Access to your account information. There is no guest checkout.  So if I buy a game my child then has carte blanche for future purchases.

Games won't have the visual quality of powerful modern consoles but the mechanics, and smoothness of movement plus the sound effects on each ear, plus the immersive experience makes this ""console"" my best purchase in the last years.I don't feel like I'm outside a fun game anymore, I'm INside the game playing it and the attention to detail is awesome.

    Nearly Perfect and Arguably the Best VR Headset Out
  
",5.0,Mikey Ren,"Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2021","









  
  
    
  So, the headset is nearly perfect but lacks in 2 main aspects: 1. Library is lacking and expensive. Lots of great games but not nearly enough. Many are sadly short and lack replayability. They also can cost a pretty penny for only a couple hours of entertainment. However, modding is where this shines. Playing old games like Doom or Half Life in VR is amazing. 2. Oculus Link. I'm sure facebook engineers have already decided that either the link is enough, they need to invest in wireless PC to headset, or that they need to add mini DP or HDMI. My hope is they go with Mini DP because USB is lacking when it comes to transmitting high resolution video at high frame rates currently. The compression and issues with certain games makes it a weaker headset compared to a dedicated PCVR one but then again, that's not where this is supposed to shine. Just wish they had mini DP and it could run exactly like a Rift S. Beyond that, it's fantastic. Excited to see the next iterations and changes with better processors and tech. Oh, and the IPD is lacking.

  I was really pleased with video quality. I love the games that I normally play with my child.HOWEVER....Very disappointed in the lack of parental controls. THere is no way to keep children out of adult content. There are free apps pre loaded that are adult content. I went into a chatroom that said you had to be 17.There was nothing asking me to verify my age. I didn't even have to lie. Withing 5 seconds of being in the lobby of the chat room I heard rated X conversations. So very disappointing. Adult content should not be preloaded or free to download without some sort of age verification.

  I have been using the Oculus Quest 2 for the last 2 weeks during our quarantine (10 year old son tested positive for COVID, but thankfully was asymptomatic). We were losing our minds and felt like we had watched every movie and played every video and board game we could. To save our sanity I bought the Quest 2 thinking that the price was low enough that if we didn't like, not a big loss. However, I've got to say that the technology is fantastic! Easy to use and the games are a lot of fun. It really feels like you are transported to another world for a brief time, which has been very welcome during this challenging year. Unlike other video games, I find the VR games to be more ""experiences"". It can be very stimulating, so I make sure our kids just play the games for no more than 20 minutes at a time. On the other hand, some the experiences can be very relaxing. Playing VR Walkabout Minigolf for a few holes really helps me to settle down at the end of the day. Other outstanding games have included: Moss, The Room, Beat Saber, Vader Immortal, and Tetris Effect.If you are thinking about buying one, especially if you are stuck at home due to COVID restrictions, just do it. You won't regret it. Truly unique experiences that you can have from the comfort of your own home. I hate Facebook, and never use my account for social purposes. However, using a Facebook account solely for VR has not lead to any intrusions into my digital life.

  My 11 yr old son saved up his own money to buy this headset, but when it arrived he said he could not activate it without my help.  So as I was trying to help him I learned that this company was purchased by Facebook awhile back and now they are FORCING you to link it through a Facebook account AND a smartphone with Bluetooth to be able to use it.... Well guess what?  Then it tells you ""We will share the information we gather about you and your use of Facebook and Oculus.""  We WILL share!  We WILL spy on you!  I am outraged -- talk about a Bait and Switch.  The younger generation doesn't do Facebook they think it is lame, so Mark Zuckerberg must have concocted this ridiculous strong armed way to FORCE them to get Facebook accounts.  Which would be bad enough, but then you  cannot even Opt-Out of them spying on you?  AND spying on your smart phone?  This is so machiavellian that I will not only return this stupid Oculus but I am also going to cancel my own Facebook account, and I am paying the difference out of MY pocket for my son to have a HTC Vive or Valve Index.  He should not be punished after working so hard to save up to buy this, but there is no way I am playing into these Facebook information spy games disguised as a VR headset.

    Thoughts after a week of having my Quest 2
  
",5.0,Shrack,"Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  So, I've had my Quest 2 for a week and here are my thoughts on it:1. Awesome VR headset. I've had some minor exposure to others (Playstation and others), but this my first dive-in, and I have to say it is great! The graphics, sound, and feedback from the controllers are amazing!2. Ability to play ""Beat Saber"". TBH, ""Beat Saber"" (a game where you slice and dice cubes to various songs) was one of the big reasons that I bought a Quest 2. I am proud to say that the experience is truly amazing. I get a good cardio workout while playing this amazing game.3. Immersion: The immersion factor is a 10 out of 10. I have done virtual exploration of Mars, riding along with folks in ""squirrel suits"", explored reefs, and other fantastic adventures with the Quest 2. Whilst playing ""Vader Immortal"", in the opening scenes, the scene reminiscent from ""Star Wars: A New Hope"" was just jaw-dropping gorgeous! It is all amazing - giving me the ""I am there"" experience one would expect from a virtual reality experience.With that said, there are some things to bear in mind:1. Facebook: Let's get the elephant out of the room: Facebook did buy Oculus and the EULA states that you need to use a Facebook account since the Oculus accounts (by themselves) are going away at the end of 2020. Thus, you will need to use your Facebook for everything Oculus. If you aren't comfortable with that, don't buy the Quest 2. It's that simple, since having a Facebook is a requirement.2. Phone app: The Quest 2 set-up did require me to use my phone to complete part of the registration by downloading the Oculus Quest 2 app. After completing set-up, I have not had to use the Oculus app on my phone since then.3. Pay to Play: Just like with any other gaming system, you will need to buy apps (games/fitness programs/etc.). A lot of the educational content is free, but entertainment tends to come with a price tag. Some are free with a monthly subscription, whilst others are pay once and then are done. Just know what you are getting into, and realize that the Oculus store is the only source of the content (afaik), so there isn't an option of doing price comparisons between different stores.4. Accessorizing: You will definitely need more than just the base unit if you want to get the most out of your Quest 2. I have purchased the extra battery/improved headband combo which definitely increased the VR session time. The Oculus branded case is also nice. If you are into intense gaming/fitness (or are planning to do so), you should get a silicone or other cover for the edges of the face, since you will generally sweat and that will make the absorbent sponge material on the Quest 2 rather gross. With a cover, you can wipe away the sweat and still not gross out anyone else wanting to play. You may want to invest in headphones if you are going to be in areas where you don't want to disturb others. Also, unless you ""cast"", nobody will be able to see what you are doing in the VR world, so that may be something to consider for a purchase. All in all, if you don't mind the FB requirement and the fact that you will need to spend a lot more than just the initial layout for the unit itself, then you will really enjoy the experiences that the Quest 2 has to offer.

    The best entry level VR system (and maybe the best overall)
  
",5.0,noxiel,"Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  This system is one of the best VR headsets on the market, and at the best price.The controllers track very well, and the controller batteries last a ridiculously long time.As a standalone headset, it is a pretty great system, though the library of games is a little limited and the battery of the headset only lasts 2 to 3 hours.As a PCVR headset, it has some of the best clarity (resolution) available, comparable to units that cost double it's price or more. The Link cable setup is easy, and works well. The option to play wireless with Virtual Desktop though is what really stands out.You will probably be wanting to upgrade the headstrap, headphones and get a powerbank to make the battery last longer, but even with those purchases, this headset is a good value product.You do need a Facebook account to use this. A Facebook account requires that you are at least 13 years of age, so that is something to consider if you are buying this for anyone younger than 13, or who you don't want to allow on Facebook.I also have a Rift S and have owned Playstation VR in the past. This is honestly a better product than either of them were, my Rift S is in a box in the closet now, and I sold the Playstation 4 pro and PSVR systems I had, because they were collecting dust.

  I am fairly new to the VR world and this thing is mind blowing and extremely fun to use. I swear it's almost worth every penny. The only real issues for it is that the headband is not comfortable and even when well adjust, it still fails to hold the Quest on your head properly. In order to see things clearly the headset has to be positioned just right and the head band does not allow that perfect position. It always is tilting because of the weight of the Quest, causing me to have to adjust the headset all the time to keep everything clear. Another issue, which doesn't bother me but will bother others is that it only has 3 eye width adjustments. so if your eyes aren't adjusting with either of the three adjustments, everything's going to be blurry always no matter how much you adjust the head straps or the eye width adjusters. After an hour of using, the headset feels too tightly pressed to my face, but it is still extremely fun to use, very responsive and is definitely a good VR headset for the price. I recommend this product. Oh and don't forget, you do have to have a Facebook account to use.

  Bricking risk. Do NOT buy this oculus guest 2 if you care about the bricking risk associated with the facebook banning pandemic. I never had a Facebook account and was required to sign up for one to use the quest 2...got blocked at sign up (fully compliant account details but AI decided to ban me upfront for violation of community guidelines.... However that is possible?). Now the guest 2 is a paperweight with NO way to use it. There's also no one that can or want to fix the issue (not even oculus). Just google oculus facebook banning issue for reference of just how bad this is.UPDATEI managed to reach out to Oculus and get someone from support to try and assist. After few mails back and forth the support people came back and said that they have spoken to Facebook about issue and someone from Facebook would contact me. The same day I received a mail from Facebook to say that I'm not banned anymore and that I can continue to use it as before.I know others weren't so lucky. but for the moment it would seem that Oculus did resolve the issue for me at least. Kidos to them for helping out when it seemed that the matter was lost.

  I've shunned Facebook from the beginning, so I'm one of few nowadays who lacks an account. Thinking I could still use an Oculus account (support ending end of 2023, of course - by which point I'll probably have moved on to the next headset), I got this headset - however, regardless of Facebook's claims, when trying to set it up, it informs you that ""Quest 2 requires a Facebook account to log in."" - apparently their promise on Oculus account support only applies to their previous headsets, not the Quest 2.Oh well, right? It's not like I'm going to use it for anything besides Oculus. Just give them my name and phone number, not -that- big a deal, right? I don't like social media enough to get sucked into it anyway. I don't (or rather, didn't) have an ideological grievance with Facebook, I just don't care for it myself.I go through the motions of making a Facebook account. As soon as the account gets made, it's immediately disabled - literally, the first page served to my new account is that its been disabled. I'm not making an account through a proxy, a VPN, through a browser with a spoofed user agent, a clever fake name like Ben Dover or anything slick like that, just a normal guy making an account from a normal browser.Apparently, if your account is disabled, the device it's linked to is effectively bricked as well. That's not even a factor in my case, because I didn't even have a chance to link the device to the account before getting disabled, but it certainly doesn't bode well for the idea of having your Facebook account play the role of gatekeeper to your device - who owns it, you or them?I'm going to give it about a day and jump through some ridiculous hoops to get my new account un-disabled; I can only imagine that if I make a new-new account with a fake name and e-mail, it'll probably be disabled eventually as well.It's utterly unbelievable. I can understand requiring an account - many platforms need one to use them, including every video game console - but to be banned immediately for simply making the account? Did they think this through all the way? Do they realize some people haven't had or wanted a Facebook account until they got this headset?I'm going to give it about a day to see if my disabled account appeal goes through, which is honestly more than it deserves - only because the hardware its self is exciting. Even if the account is (re?)instated, I'm going to throw the Quest back in its box and return it, because this simply unbelievable even for a walled garden product.

  Honestly it’s not really that great. I expected a lot from this and it did not live up to the hype at all. The graphics aren’t NEARLY as good as what people hyped them up to be. There aren’t even a lot of apps to go with this thing yet......not sure if developers will be creating more but I was seriously underwhelmed.....not even with the gaming but with just the options to explore. There were several apps I went on that took you to different countries and the image quality was poor at best. Blurry sometimes and slightly hi quality at others. The only thing I really love is the attention and detail they put into safety (which makes sense because I imagine they don’t want to be held liable for anything). But coming from someone who loves gaming and hi def, beautiful things this was just extremely underwhelming. Not really worth the money imo and it’s not even that comfortable. Easy for the vision to get blurry no matter how much you adjust it. All the games cost money as well which isn’t a deal breaker but is annoying and just thought you all should know. Overall VERY okay but not worth the price point and kind of disappointing/boring. It’s very easy to tell that this is still a product in the works.

  Awesome all in one system and the graphics i think personally are better on the Quest 2 than PSVR and original Quest.Works well linked to my CPU to play steam VR games as well as mirror my cpu into the goggles too. After upgrading the display on the one site, the graphics are a bit sharper and refresh rate makes a difference (Look up online how to do it)  I just wish the battery life was a lot longer than 2 hours and recommend the external battery to strap to it if you do not have a long USB-C to USB charger or Oculus Link Cable to keep it plugged in. But you should not be using them for longer than a hour at a time as an adult anyway. The only thing I wish they would do is add more space shooters to its game line up but thanks to Steam VR and other oculus apps that mirror your CPU to the goggles, it keeps me going.Recommend getting the Oculus grips and covers along with the elite strap for the goggles itslef for comfort and protection because it is not cheap to replace the remotes if you break them whacking the wall or the ceiling when you start getting excited.Side Note:its $100 more for almost triple the memory and Black color, but i have not ran into a memory issue with the 20 apps and games i have downloaded onto it with the $299 model. Except when i use the DJ app and download mp3 music onto it for the turntables.Worth the money and find myself playing it twice as much as I do my new Xbox series X console do to being able to take it on trips and watch movies in bed while not interrupting my GF when she is sleeping lol.

  Ok. I had the quest that I purchased a week prior to this announced product and was a bit upset. I searched everywhere for the quest and had to by it off of the ""black"" market per se, only paid 75 over retail though.With that, this is an improvement in many things. The screen does look better. The original quest, gave me a headache to watch shows or youtube, netflix, this one, you can watch everything. The headache was part of multiple things, but the main thing is , old quest you can see pixels. The screen was...blah at best to me.The controllers feel great. My only gripe is that that the head strap should not have come on this at all. This should have been built with the elite strap and with the information that I am allowing Facebook to gather on me with this, they most definitely can afford that.Virtual desktop, with a few extra apps installed on your computer such as virtual desktop streamer, sidequest, and then your steam vr or other is SO FREAKING GREAT!!!!! 90hz playing squadrons looks MUCH better than the cable right now. My only issue thus far is attaching an xbox controller on this. The app says I am good, but it just never actually connects. Once I figure this out, I can play squadrons in my living room and that would be most austacious.Other gripe is that the face part does not block out all light...like, at ALL. This should be unacceptable. Seriously, everything that Facebook/Oculus has as an extra, minus the battery pack strap, should be what comes on this in stock form. I am loving how all the companies are going this route of taking things away (apple, iphone) and then charging extra for crap that should have come with it. Its not saving the environment and all it is doing is padding profits. Again, with the information that I HAD to allow facebook to utilize for using this device, they can afford it.Anyhow, Final: Would purchase again, would suggest this for everyone. Buy virtual desktop for 20 bucks, do the hour or two of work to get it working on your computer/laptop and have fun both with native oculus and wireless connectivity. **Cable attached does NOT give you 90hz**

  First of all for all the morons that think you're interesting enough for Facebook to collect your info and it .atters at all. Go live off of the grid and quit being hypocritical. You're vegans wearing leather shoes trying to stop pollution while driving a beat up vw that wouldn't pass an emission test. The Quest 2 is frigging awesome!!! I have been buying vr headsets since the beginning. The graphics still have a long way to go. Alyx from steam is the best yet. The headset can't quite keep up with what Valve has created. It's borderline real, but it gets laggy at times. I put a tower fan to cool my play area which has helped a lot. A spring loaded retractable cord for the pc connection would be ideal though. I pinned mine to the ceiling and have it dangle in the middle of my play area but still gets in the way. This is an evolutionary step and not the finished product people. Name one thing that is perfect? Quit being such winey little bitchs. Trolls just need a hug and a beat down. If you're looking for an out of body experience...quest 2.

  I have had 2 different units at this point and each one has had some sort of hardware issue. The first one the handsets just decided to not register anything anymore and Amazon graciously replaced that one. I received my replacement last week and this one has the sound cut off randomly only to be fixed by resetting the headset. This would be fine if it were occasional but this occurs at least 3 times in a 2 hour period so it is very frequent. Amazon, sadly, couldn't replace this one due to the item now being out of stock but did offer a small refund which was kind of them but this is disappointingThe issue of requiring Facebook isn't the hugest issue since you can just use an account you don't use very much, but the UI is not very user-friendly. It can be hard to find where your most recent purchases are and the device doesn't seem to like you making purchases in the device itself but on the app (which feels entirely useless. The app doesn't really do anything and I frequently forget it even exists).At this point, I don't feel like this system is really worth the money and I would advise spending the money on a different VR system.

    Some improvements over original Quest, but IPD/lenses are a disaster!
  
",3.0,D. Kallan,"Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2020","









  
  
    
  Better graphics, better controllers with better battery life, lighter headset than the original Quest.  All good.  But the lens/IPD system is a disaster!IPD is the measure of inter-pupillary distance—basically how wide-set your eyes are.  Some people have narrow IPDs in the 50mm range, others are 70 or even 80+, and most people fall in the low- to mid-60s.  With binocular vision, everyone has a range: when you look at something up close, you cross your eyes a bit, narrowing the IPD, and when you gaze into the distance your IPD widens.  This is important for VR headsets because each lens should sit right at the center of each eye.  Most quality headsets are adjustable for this reason.The original Quest had lenses on a physical slider assembly that adjusted continuously from 58mm to at least 70mm, and each lens had its own dedicated display that moved along with it.  The field of view was the same regardless of IPD.The Quest 2 only has three fixed lens positions—58mm, 63mm and 68mm—and a single display that sits statically in front of both lenses.  When you adjust the IPD, the display digitally moves the placement of the two images on the screen to “match” the lens positions.  Obviously this is cheaper to manufacture, and there are fewer parts to fail, but for those not lucky enough to be within a millimeter or two of those IPDs, it is a serious downgrade.My IPD is 71.5mm, not freakishly wide but a bit wider than average.  The best I can do with the Quest 2 is the 68mm setting, which makes it hard to get a clear picture in both eyes, introduces some distortion and chromatic aberrations (from off-center fresnel lenses), and requires me to cross my eyes a bit during play—uncomfortable and headache-inducing.Also annoying is that the single display panel is optimized for 63mm.  If you go narrower, the single screen panel digitally moves the two images closer together, narrowing the field of view and losing some of inside peripheral detail.  If you go wider, the panel moves the two images outward, narrowing the FoV on the outside.  And in the 68mm setting, part of the bezel pops into view, giving the sensation of looking through a helmet or a tube.I still have my original Quest.  The other day I was setting it up for my girlfriend.  I put on the Quest, pushed the slider to the maximum IPD, and what a difference!  The graphics aren’t quite as good as the Quest 2, but the comfort and clarity were so much better!!!There are plenty of phone apps that measure your IPD.  If you’re in the 56–70mm range, you should be okay; if you’re in the 57–59mm or 67–69mm range, even better; and if you’re a lucky one in the  62–64mm, you should have a near-perfect fit.  But for the rest of us, Facebook/Oculus did a serious disservice and limited their customer base.If the Quest 2 had the continuous IPD slider and dual displays like the original Quest, I would have given it 5 stars.

  I ordered this product for my birthday but when I set it up I was a little disappointed. The game store was super limited. Most games will run you $20-30. not to mention the micro transactions. If you do find a game worth your time make sure you order a new head strap and face cover.  The stock strap does not disperse the weight evenly and will leave you with a sore neck. The last issue is the face cover. Its made of cheap foam. If you have pets or don't dust your house often this thing is magnet for hair and other particles. You will feel it scratching your eyes. Ive now had to order a new head strap and a new face cover. I really only use the movie app big screen now but the battery life will only last about one movie. You'll need at least a 10 ft or 16 ft usb-c cord if you want longer play time. Overall its been kind of sad seeing how this will probably be outdated in a year..

  I am so unhappy with my Oculus customer support experience.  I am unable to merge my Facebook and existing Oculus accounts since Sun 1-31-2021 - it is now Friday 2-5-2021.  I bought a $400 piece of hardware of which is 100% dependent upon me being able to use it by linking it to Facebook (even though I already have an Oculus account).  For some reason, my account is failing in the merge process and THE ONLY WAY CONTACT Oculus support is via email.  You can't even contact Oculus Support via FACEBOOK!?!  Unfortunately for me, Oculus support only seems to check their email once per day, and then when they do, they ask me a single question, which I promptly answer.  Then it takes them ~24 hours for them to review and ask me another single question, to which I promptly answer.  Rinse and repeat.  Why doesn't Oculus Support ask me the whole barrage of questions that they need to get me online as quickly as possible?  I am so upset about this equipment and being unable to use it.  HORRIBLE customer service.  I am ready to send this unit back to Oculus and go with another brand.

  I've only ever dipped my toe into the world of VR via my iPhone and a goggle attachment. Ads for the new Oculus kept coming up on Facebook and once I saw that there were highly-rated fitness games and the low cost, I thought I'd give it a try. Well, the first night I tried it, I played until the battery ran out. The next day I started racking up all the installs on games and add-ons. Plus, with a $20 attachment to my spin bike, I can add that into the mix. For me, this is a crazy crazy life-changer! It's light so there's no pulling on your head and although I wear reading glasses, I don't seem to need them. Now I'm trying to convince my friends to get one so we can hang out in VR and stay covid safe!

",5.0,Jay M,"Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have tried many VR headsets. I started using headsets since google cardboard and cellphone based headsets like Samsung Galaxy VR (which wasn't too bad). I tried the first Oculus series as well as many newer PC based VR headsets including Windows Virtual Reality based headsets (Samsung Oddessy plus and ...). When Oculus 2 was ready to launch, I had it on the very same day (thx to Amazon). The Oculus Quest 2 is the best virtual reality headset by far based on the value and it's capabilities. It's not perfect and this industry still has a long way to go but it's way more practical than anything else I have ever tried. This is a headset which gives you options for using it on the go and completely wireless or by connecting it to a powerful PC, you can have one of the most powerful VR headset anyone could dream about, all with a reasonable cost that most people can simply afford (thx to Facebook). The headset is very comfortable and light. It's very well designed and has the biggest virtual reality platform (Oculus) behind it. You can simply open and use any game and app which is made on steam as well (by using the Oculus wire). I would definitely recommend this headset to anyone. Have fun and enjoy the technology and endless possibilities.

",5.0,Joshua Humphress,"Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2021","









  
  
    
  I cannot stress enough how much I love my Quest 2! The visuals are jaw-dropping, and the controls are smooth and responsive. Being completely wireless and untethered is simply amazing, and now you can wirelessly run pcvr games, so the link cable isn't necessary (as long as you have really good wifi and internet). The Quest 2 makes high-end quality VR affordable and accessible and I cannot recommend it enough.One of the greatest things about the Quest 2 is that you don't need a television, xbox, playstation, or even a computer to play it! (Unless you want to play pc games on it, of course lol.) It is a completely standalone system with just the headset and the two controllers, and with it's incredible hand tracking, you don't even need the controllers 😆! Ok, you do need the controllers, because, unfortunately, the remote-less hand tracking is unique to the Quest and there aren't many games that support it yet. It's still a fun little gimmick to play with, though.There are two cons to the system, however, in my experience. One is that the default headset strap makes it very front-heavy, which can get uncomfortable after extended periods of use.The second is that the battery only lasts about 2-3 hours at a time before needing recharged.Both of these issues can be resolved with the replacement pro strap accessory that has the added battery pack in the back.TL/DR; Very good for very cheap

  I can't begin to describe how much I've enjoyed this!! The games are fun (I really only purchased it for beat saber) but the immersive 3D experience with Oculus TV and 3D movies has benn AMAZING!  I have an older Oculus and I absolutely LOVED going around the world with Google Earth.  I only hope Google Earth comes to Oculus Quest soon then this would be perfect.  I watched some guy traveling up Everest (not the movie, it was a documentary of sorts) and that experience alone was worth the $300 because now I don't need to spend money training and going there for myself!  Seriously - this technology is so cool!  You'll need to finagle the eye pieces a bit to get it to look right, but even the sound is super impressive.  You can use headphones/earbuds or listen right from the unit without - it sounds fantastic!  I only got the 64GB version which is fine for what I do since I don't plan on playing any huge hardcore games and so far I've only used like 8GB.  If you have an extra $300 lying around - BUY THIS!!!

",2.0,Dogeson,"Reviewed in the United States October 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had the original oculus quest and loved it but the only issue was that it was uncomfortable and heavy...which is why i was so excited to see the quest 2 come out. I loved everything about it and up until now i felt it was a 5 star product and i never really cared about how you needed a facebook account to use your 300$ headset until i realized something. I was about to buy another game on top of the job simulator i already had when i felt worried because i didn't want to spend money and risk losing it if facebook deleted my account. I shouldn't feel this way. Now I don't think i will ever fully enjoy the quest 2 because of that fear of losing all my games, all my money, and all my progress. This had the potential to become something greater...and i'm pretty disappointed because the technology was there but so was a way to force people into facebooks ecosystem. Edit: I have now changed the review to 2 stars after the lense was scratched WHILE I USED THE GLASSES SPACER. I am pretty upset about this so I think you should know in advance to figure out some other way to use your quest without glasses unless you are really careful and want to take the risk. I gave the headset to my dad and put it on his head carefully while he wore his glasses but after he took it off there was an enormous scratch in the center so yeah be careful and I recommend those prescription lense inserts.

    If you can deal with the Facebook situation, I can't really think of a better option at this price
  
",4.0,Just_An_IT_Guy,"Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2020","Summary at the bottom for those who don't want to read the whole review.

I was originally looking into getting a VR setup to use occasionally but mainly to give my mother an outlet to do some of the things that she loved doing back before her health started to deteriorate and made her housebound. She was never one who would want the new technology (she still has a flip phone!) but the quest made it easy to teach someone with basically zero computer skills how to operate the headset with ease. I used the casting option and put it on my PC so she could watch me and ask questions as we went through everything. After about 10 minutes of going through a few things, I gave her the headset and she was off playing mini-golf and a few other things while enjoying every second of it.

I know the whole facebook gathering user data argument is valid and I understand both sides but for my own reasons, this was the best bang for the buck headset that ticked all of the boxes I was looking for. My biggest complaint with FB is them banning accounts with no recourse for the buyer.

Having something portable and could play PCVR games was a big attention getter for me and I haven't been disappointed in the graphics, compatibility, ease of use, or really had any complaint other than FB now owning Oculus and taking away what would have been the go-to VR company for years to come.

Even the included head strap is fairly comfortable. I put on the headset, move either side strap until it clears my ear, and then tighten the straps on both sides equally to try and balance the pressure. It's worked well so far and even after long sessions, I still don't notice any discomfort and if I do, it doesn't last long after the headset is off. I'm even more excited for when the games start taking advantage of the higher refresh rate of the display and texture density. It's already convincing in many aspects but the future of VR is looking great!

OVERALL VERDICT:
-If Facebook is a deal-breaker for you then get a different headset but if you can get past that, you will absolutely LOVE this gaming experience that will only get better as updates rollout and new developers enter the space. By enabling developer mode, you can use the oculus developer app to get even more power for your wireless experience.

****Also, I've heard that the elite straps are breaking so if you purchase this headset, wait for a 3rd party vendor strap to come out and use the included strap that comes with the headset until then. Maybe they will fix the problem but I wouldn't buy the elite strap anyways.****

Pros:
-AMAZING display! Rivals some $1000 headsets
-HEADPHONE JACK! Add in some amazing headphones and feel teleported into an amazing game, movie, or jam out to some awesome music
-Want more battery life? Don't settle for the elite strap's one size battery and just get a 3rd party power bank that can expand your playtime even more AND doubles as a travel charger for any of your other electronics for SOOO much cheaper.
-Hand tracking is improved over the original quest from what others have told me(This is my first real VR headset and it worked great for me other than when the cameras only could see part of hands)
-I've been playing it daily for a few hours(myself and my mother) to see how the controller batteries would handle it and they are still on 4 dots so I think they've also improved on power draw since that was a complaint of the original quest owners. The tracking of the controllers didn't seem to suffer either as I haven't had a problem with that even in games like beat saber.
-The box it comes in is sturdy enough to be used as a decent case until you decide to get a more permanent one and will keep the dust from getting on your lenses.

Cons:
-Facebook wanting to track everything about everyone and the fact that they can brick your headset at any point without warning and potentially not reverse that decision even if they make a mistake is terrible and there should be a way for customers to hold FB accountable for that. I have to tip my hat to FB purely from a generating user activity standpoint. People were leaving FB left and right (myself included) so they decided to buy up all the companies people were now using.
-Limited amount of accessories and the ones that are available are priced too high
-Oculus Link cable is a joke at $85 when I can get a high-quality USB 3.1 gen 2 for under $40 which is plenty for crystal clear PCVR gaming. If your PC doesn't have USB 3.1 gen 2, you can still buy an adapter and cable for less than the official cable
-Official Link cable is type-c which unless you have a newer motherboard, you probably won't have the port for it and have to buy another expensive adapter.
-The white color is a dirt magnet so if you want to keep it looking pristine for more than a month, looking into a cover for the headset would be a good idea.",Hardware Platform: Oculus Quest 2 - 256 GB

  The headset itself is very very awesome. The headset is lightweight and easy to carry if you get the case, feels lighter and smaller when compared to Oculus Quest 1. The controllers are very good and accurate (although i did have some accuracy problems when using in darker rooms). Although it's better in specs compared to Oculus Quest 1 but it feels cheaper because it is, the lower price tag reflects in it's build and feel. Overall the picture quality and the smooth 90hz makes it awesome and better than the first but requiring Facebook is a no-go in my opinion.Facebook can and will disable your account and that will render the headset useless. The headset has awesome features but Facebook ruined it by having a mandatory Facebook account requirement. Read a lot of horror stories on internet where people who don't use Facebook and made a new account, got their accounts suspended. I do have an old account but i don't use Facebook much so i didn't have this problem but buyer beware.Not recommended just because of Facebook requirement, if that is lifted i'd recommend it.

  I'll give my review of the Quest 2 1st & then some background info if interested.Quest 2: I purchased the 256GB model & also opted for the Elite Head Strap with built in battery & carrying case combo deal. (Which I highly recommend you get as well! The Elite Head Strap is dramatically better in every way than the standard, the integrated battery doubles your play time & you don't notice any weight difference & the official Oculus Quest 2 carrying case is well made & it all fits inside perfectly.)Quest 2 headset is very noticeably smaller & lighter than the Quest and/or Rift S. The integrated speakers sound great & are also a notable improvement. The resolution is so crisp & clear. Everything runs considerably faster too!Quest 2 with Oculus Link works perfectly & honestly better than my Rift S does!In case you are not aware, FB has stated that Go, Quest 1 are no longer being sold, Rift S will be discontinued next year as well. Going forward there will only be 1 Headset (with different storage options).Background info:My 1st headset was the Oculus Go, which I thought was awesome! The one thing I didn't like was you still needed a Rift to play PC games. So when the Quest & Rift S came out, I jumped all over the Rift S. The PC games were mind-blowing, but I missed the portability of the Go. Then FB comes out with Oculus Link which allows the Quest to also play PC games (essentially making it a Rift S on demand). I was so mad, because this left Rift S owner's like myself feeling cheated. Now FB is discontinuing the Rift line all together & going forward will only have 1 headset. Oculus Link eliminated the need for a PC specific headset.

  I can’t believe I’m writing this. I was so excited for the improved chipset, resolution, and memory. But the move to an LCD screen has removed any dark black color. For example, one of my favorite apps is Skybox VR, which lets you watch movies in a virtual movie theater. This looked great on the original Quest, but on Quest 2 the theater doesn’t look dark, but rather appears as though it’s filled with fog. This also makes it difficult to make out the details of the environment.The lack of springs on the strap mounts, as well as the narrower width of the headset, are two other drawbacks. I wear glasses, and they claim it supports frames up to 142mm wide, but mine are 136 and always get stuck in the headset as I’m removing it because they’re snug against the inside of it.Maybe once we get some games which make use of the better processor things will seem different, but as for now, these are some major issues.

It’s very important to pay attention to the instructions and READ them. I wanted to experience it and later noticed I had it in for more than an hour.

    Not too shabby, but... some things to consider
  
",4.0,M. Bauer,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2020","UPDATE: 10/20/2020 - Oculus Rift CV1, S, Quest, and now, Quest 2 owner here. Each iteration has been an improvement from the previous one. Some step-ups were more obvious than others, and depending on how you value your dollar, the upgrades might not always measure up to your expectations. However, at this price point there shouldn’t be much of ANYTHING standing in your way of buying it... especially if you are new to VR or have an older model and are merely looking for the best visual experience in a wireless setup. The Quest 2 reigns supreme in this category.

Pros:

• Resolution - amazing clarity! Upping the pixel density once again has just made it that much easier for me to suspend my disbelief. This time, though, the jump is grand! At 1832 x 1920 per eye, this is by far the best reason of snagging up an Oculus Quest 2! The color is vivid and lines are crisp. When we're talking VR, LCD offers a cleaner image over OLED. Who'd a thunk, right? You have to remember, the lenses are magnifying the screen, so how the individual pixels are arranged do make a difference. And the LCD layout is more compact than an OLED. Yes, you do loose a little contrast having “brighter blacks” from the required backlighting on the LCD, but he trade off means not having to deal with those pesky god-rays or that screen door effect.

• Refresh Rate - very smooth, even at the default 72Hz! In the beta settings there's a 90Hz option... potentially putting this wireless version back up to where we’d expect to see only the tethered units.

• Tracking - right on par with the Quest 1 and very close to the Rift S. There’s no beating Constellation Tracking like we had on the CV1, but they’ve come a long way to make Inside-Out Tracking work amazingly well. The accelerometers in the hand controllers pick up where the cameras’ FOV leaves off - giving us a perceived tracking on the far outside and behind the head. Because we are relying on algorithms essentially ""guessing"" where the controllers are in these extreme regions, you may notice a twitch or two while pulled back with your bow or aiming a tightly shouldered sub machine gun. I should also touch on hand tracking (pun very much so intended, lol). Here, you can ditch the controllers and use your hands to manipulate your environment. There aren't a lot of supported titles yet, but that will likely change over time. Naturally, you loose the accelerometer-aided tracking you get with the controllers, but the cameras do track the hands and each finger individually ...so long as you're able to keep them within the cam's FOV.

• Guardian - This feature received a nice upgrade as well. The pass-though feature kicks in to present the outside world to the viewer when one steps outside a user-defined boundary. This time, however, the b&w video feed is aligned more accurately than before and it is far less grainy. Setup of the boundary is VERY simple and if the room changes (ie. furniture moves or heaps of dirty laundry find their way inside the boundary, the device displays the new obstacles as soon as you put the headset on and ya verify guardian boundary.

• Controllers - they have a more robust and girthy feel... much like the ones that were included with the earlier CV1 and developer models. I never had any issues with my battery covers being loose like others reportedly had on previous models. But, there’s no question these covers aren’t going anywhere for those of you with concerns. It's funny how people get used to something being one way and hate change... because when the S and Quest came out, everyone hated how small and flimsy the new controllers felt. Here, they go back to the original size and ya got a whole new group upset at how large these feel, haha.

• Comfort - Significantly lighter than its predecessors. The head strap isn’t as easy to adjust as the others, but the elastic straps are thick and seem to keep the headset in place well enough. The padding that rests against your face is soft and cushioning, but I can’t really say it’s as rugged as the Quest 1. Time will tell how it will hold up.

• Purchases - Oculus Home purchases crossover seamlessly from Quest 1 to Quest 2.

• Link cable - plugging into one’s high-end gaming PC opens this thing up to surpassing the Rift S in clarity and allows the same sharing of content.

• Audio - We can use our own headphones. The 3.5mm headphone jack gives us the option to enhance what’s being output through its standard amplifier. So get yourself a nice pair of Sony, Bose, or Sanheisers... really any of ‘em are better than the factory option and will slide easily over the elastic straps.

Cons:

• Audio - it suffices, but it’s no secret that there’s PLENTY of room for improvement here. I believe I’m picking up a slightly better bass response, but there’s a definite tin-can shrillness snuck somewhere in the mid to high end frequencies. It’s very off-putting. Not sure if this is title based, hardware, or speaker placement. The Rift S and Quest 1 suffered through this early on too, so I would not be surprised if we see a firmware upgrade soon.

• IPD - glad to see the inter pupillary distance settings are still mechanical. BUT sadly, they limit the user to only three variations (58, 63, and 68mm). This is probably ample enough for most users, but there may be those who fall between the cracks and may notice regions of the screen that aren’t as refined. IPD is where the Rift S completely fell short (software adjustment moved the displayed image, not the lenses), so Quest 2 is still WAY better than that. I absolutely loved the way Quest 1 handled this adjustment (having its gradual slider on the outside), but the additional linkage would equate to a higher cost. My IPD is 65mm, so I fall between the 63 and 68 notches. My brain/eyes seem to adjust to the variance just fine and I have yet to get a headache from it. It is a good idea to speak with your optometrist. They may provide you with your exact IPD number. Know that most will tell you that ± a millimeter or two won't cause any harm. If you are taking your own IPD measurements, then the margin of error will likely fluctuate that much anyway. And, if you are just trying what “feels right” then you can throw precision completely out the window. The latter is what most people were doing anyway, so the three settings encompass most everyone right from the get-go. If you’re getting headaches, this could be the cause, but there are other factors to consider… could be the refresh rate, the FOV, spacing between eyes and lens, peripheral vision, or even how hard your brain is working to focus on distant objects that really aren’t distant. If you get headaches watching 3D movies, then VR headsets will probably give you headaches too.

• Glasses wearers - the included spacer helps, but depending on your frames and lenses, there’s still a chance for rubbing. The contact will scratch both the oculus lenses and my coated polycarbonate Rx lenses. Seeking 3rd party solutions in this area is a priority for me.
UPDATE: I found these silicone spacer things that snap on to the oculus lenses and work great. No scratches now!

• Color - I’m an adult that takes care of their equipment, but even so I sweat during physically intense gameplay. It’s true that no matter the color, sweat saturated fabric and foam portions of the headset will get nasty and require periodic cleaning and disinfecting. But I imagine the light stuff is eventually gonna’ start to discolor... clean or not. If you have filthy children/teens, or simply don’t practice good hygiene yourself, the light grey might not be a good friend to you.

• Facebook - yeah, ya gotta’ link a Facebook account to the headset. To be fair, it does say so in the description... ya’ll read that BEFORE making your purchase, right? If any of us still think anonymity exists anywhere within the digital landscape of the internet, then I think we’d do well re-read the user agreements on all our connected devices, lol. Yeah, it ain’t great, and I’m by no means a fan of this move, but what are our alternatives?
UPDATE: As of late, I’m hearing that if fb renders your social media account invalid, it essentially bricks all our Oculus headsets. That is pretty messed up if there’s no other workaround. I’d be upset too! I mean, if I purchased the hardware and all the games... to be denied it’s use due to some outside influences, should equate to a refund of monies spent at the very least! Personally, I have had no issues. Hopefully tech support hears the cry of the people and they fix this quickly. At least we’re free from paid subscriptions with this thing... for now anyway.

• Purchases - As mentioned earlier, Oculus Home purchases crossover seamlessly from Quest 1 to Quest 2. Now, when moving from Rift S to the Quest, whether or not that requires the end user to purchase the title a second time, is left up to the producer. What is frustrating is having all purchases linked to one single account. Of the three headsets we have in the household, each needs linked to a separate fb account if we wish to play with/against one another in multiplayer modes. Thus, forcing us to purchase the same title THREE times in order to make “in-home multiplayer” happen.
UPDATE: This now appears to be title related as one game I own, “Walkabout Mini Golf” let’s me play against one another simultaneously on all three my headsets... This is legit... I can see my daughter and her friend on the same putting green I’m playing on and we can all run around the map while waiting our turn.

The moot:

• Cooling fan - when playing processor-heavy titles, the cooling fan will kick on and there’s no disguising it. Yup, that is a fan I hear. But whatever, good airflow in an enclosed system makes a sound... albeit, it is NOT loud by any stretch of the word. Again, it’s merely a small trade-off for having more processing power strapped to your face.

• The mic? Everyone seems to be able to hear me just fine when I talk. Granted, it’s no RØDE or Sennheiser, but I didn’t expect it to be. It accepts all the sound waves I spew at it just fine. The only time I hear something weird is when someone doesn’t have their mic/headphone levels set correctly... giving us that robotic reverb, annoying feedback, or just cuts out. But that is the case with any headset. You weren’t planning on using it for voice-over work or laying down vocal tracks on your next single, right? Any of you who can tell a major difference in mics... idk what to say. If we’re completely honest, none of these headsets have “amazing audio” hardware, so... take it as you will and let’s get back to focusing on the meat and potatoes.

• Direct sunlight can burn the screen and/or harm the cameras (is that any real surprise though?). The lenses are just magnifying glasses…. Think of how those ants felt when ya burnt them under the summer sun. For shame. Again, go to the Oculus site and read up on the product you purchased for details, but the gist of it is, “using it outside at noon is a bad idea”.

• Doesn’t function in complete darkness or very well in extremely dim light. Theses aren’t IR cameras, they’re optical cameras and require light for the sensors to detect… well, light. So I turn a light on and I’m good to go. The Quest 2 now indicates when it’s too dark with a popup letting you know. Tracking gets finicky in oversaturated rooms, or those with too many windows and/or mirrors. Some lighting emits a specific frequency (as with SOME crappy fluorescent and lower-end LED lighting) if the pulses happen to phase up to your devices, you may notice some “glitching”.

• Battery life - It is as described. Because of the increased performance, it doesn't last as long as the Quest 1. External battery options are available. OR, you can always get a long USB-C cord and plug it in while you play. No, it ain’t cordless at that point, but it gets me by if I’m not ready to be done.

A little prelude (at the end of the review):
My first experience with an actual VR headset was in the 90’s in the VFX1. With a resolution of somewhere around 240² per eye, 256 colors at a time, awful tracking/movement latency, and a frame rate that had us calling it the “tunnel-vision migraine machine”, ANY of today’s headsets are like a dream come true in comparison. These early devices were a novel concept but limited to a handful of playable games like Descent, Quake, and some flight simulator whose title escapes me. Ok, sure... until you’d succumb to the headache or crashed DOS… whichever came first, lol.

So, although we may be able to pick these current products apart to find their flaws, I’m still thrilled to be able to use any of these devices. They are exponentially more capable and affordable than their pre-2015 predecessors... heck, even our lowest-end cell phone VR rigs have more processing power than the PCs we were tethered to back then. Depending on one’s level of entitlement, expectation, and/or brand loyalty, you can draw your own conclusions. I’ve given you mine.",Hardware Platform: Oculus Quest 2 - 256 GB

  So, I used to be a fairly avid gamer, but I haven't played much of anything in well over a decade. The common excuses of life, family, career, etc. certainly all apply, but TBH, the real culprit has just been lack of interest. As in ""Great, here comes another MMORPG, or shoot 'em up war / zombie FPS that's incrementally better than the last dozen that preceded it and will require another $1000 video card upgrade, 100hrs to figure out how to play, and exacerbate the RSS endemic of anyone who's spent their career in IT."" ***yawn***And then someone let me use their Oculus Quest 2 last weekend, (after which I immediately purchased one.) I haven't been awed by anything gaming related in, well... the last time was probably the first 3DFX Voodoo 1 card 25 years ago. I dunno, I tried the original Rift 5ish years ago, and while it was novel, it just didn't grab me. Maybe it was the lower resolution, or I tried the wrong titles, but the immersion wasn't there. This thing on the other hand... wow. MSFS 2020 in VR is amazing!

    Beautiful headset, worst ecosystem on the planet.
  
",1.0,some guy from Pittsburgh,"Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  Let me start by saying I really like this headset from a hardware perspective. I upgraded from an original HTC Vive to a Rift S last year, which I replaced with this headset this year. The screen looks great with basically zero screen door effect. There are still some god-rays in certain lighting conditions but it is never so bad as to distract from the experience. The controller batteries last FOREVER compared to pervious controllers I've used. Kudos to them on this.The reason I am making my review so low is the closed ecosystem. When you buy a smartphone, you pay a large sum up front for a device, but there is a nearly infinite number of free apps to keep you distracted or productive for hours at no extra cost, unless you buy in-app purchases. There are also higher quality apps that have a price tag on them, but these are optional.By default, the Oculus Quest has enough free content to keep you engaged for maybe an hour. And most of the apps are literally five minute demos of full games. If you want to buy all the best games, it's gonna be hundreds more dollars out of your pocket.This is because Oculus very closely vets what games can be in it's store, in order to assure quality or some nonsense answer like that. Lots of good developers have had their games excluded for basically no reason. As a software developer myself, I can't imagine how much it would hurt if I spent months developing a game just to have it rejected from the store. I guess there is nothing inherently wrong with Oculus managing the store how it wants, but there have been lots of shadier practices as well. For example, they push back against apps like Bigscreen in favor of their own ""infinite office"" product (which you can't even get yet by the way), and they push back against certain fitness tracking apps in favor of their own app. I won't go as far as to accuse them of plagiarism but they are Facebooking it real hard with the anticompetitive attitude, and I bet Zuck is proud of them.Because of this Zuckery, devs find other ways to distribute their apps. There is a service called SideQuest that allows you to sideload games onto your Quest 2, and without it this device is kind of pointless. All the Oculus store rejects gather there. And, many of the great games on SideQuest are completely free! But the process of installing SideQuest may be a bit difficult for non-technical folks, involving weird steps like creating a developer account.There is also Steam VR, to play all your favorite games you bought already. But really, if the device has 128 gigs of storage now, why can't I just install SteamVR onto the headset itself and play directly from there? Why must I pay 90 dollars for a link cable to play the VR games I already own, including ones from Oculus store? (Yep, that's a thing too) Luckily it isn't all bad, you can pay 35 dollars for a bootleg link cable that will fail after a week. I can't even stress enough how few good games are available without sideloading or using Oculus Link. Even on the back of the box, the games they advertise are BeatSaber (which has been around since I got my Vive almost four years ago) The Climb (which has been around even longer) the next Star Wars game they made (again nothing really new, some eye candy with a Star Wars theme) and three other games that are actually new. Even the box itself hilariously demonstrates the lack of good games because half of them are newer versions of games that already existed. Pretty sure the Rift S box had more games on it but I'd have to dig it out of the closet to confirm.Additionally I've heard other developers say that there is no reason for this device not to run Android apps natively (on a flat screen in 3D space of course), since it is basically an android device. I'm not sure whether this is actually feasible (I'm sure Oculus would say it isn't) but it would drastically increase the amount of stuff you can do with your device.One last rant, the Passthrough mode where you can see your surroundings is great, except there is no way to permanently turn it on. By default it turns on when you leave your play space, and you can set it as your menu environment to have it always on as long as you be a good boy and stay in your play area. But as you begin to get further away from your play area, it darkens the screen until it completely turns off and finally tells you to turn around as you flail like an idiot in pitch dark or take the headset off. I want to be able to go grab a water bottle in the next room without taking it off, and yet there is no way to do this without making and enormous play space that takes up your whole house floor. I just can't understand why, especially with an untethered headset, why they don't trust us to go five feet from the play area. With the improved quality cameras, there is a zero percent chance of me running into anything, at least as long as they are turned on. So why then is it a feature to TURN THEM OFF WHILE YOU ARE WALKIBG AROUND? Facebook literally treats you like cattle. Stay in your enclosure. Oh, and if you turn off the guardian completely, the passthrough is just always complete darkness. Thanks for that. This frustrates me more than anything else and that makes me sad. This headset makes me sad. I don't like being sad. So I don't like this headset.But I will continue to use it because it's pretty and Mark really needs those 3D scans of my living room that are tied to my identity because you must use a Facebook account to log in oh yeah have you heard about th

    Fail! The controllers are way too thick!
  
",2.0,Fri3dT0fu,"Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  I upgraded from a Rift S and an original Quest, and while the performance seems better overall, the controllers redesign is a fail for me.I’m a woman but I don’t have particularly small hands. The increased thickness of the controllers make my grip feel less secure, because I’m basically only gripping with my pinky. I have to press the controller handle against my palm because my pinky and ring fingers won’t wrap around the controller. It also often makes me accidentally press the grip button.I hope I can get used to it, and just because of the controllers, the Quest 2 is a huge disappointment. The controller fit is so incredibly important, and they ruined it because they probably didn’t really think about medium and small hands. I can’t even imagine how it would be for a kid. They wouldn’t be able to hold it at all.

  I have also been into VR, at the moment I use a PlayStation VR and Now I have the Quest 2. This this wasnted even on my radar but I say that  FB made a 2nd version and it was more than 60% better but also cheaper. After picking it up and playing with it for a few days I have been hooked. I can say without a doubt I am in the quest 2 at least 3-4 hrs a day.I have spent hours making new friends and hanging out with people on oculus in VR poker, Real Fishing, big screen beta and multiplayer games.Hardware is sturdy, visuals are perfect and has ZERO SCREEN DOOR EFFECT. It's also a LCD display so the blacks aren't the best but because of the LCD it's near 4k display and can give you 90hz for smooth gameplay. Colors are great and looks very accurate to me.The inside out tracking and guardian system is 120% accurate and just works.Then on top of that you can connect a high speed or the official oculus Link cable to your going PC to get even better visuals and better gaming  experience to be on the level of high end vr gamer's and play Steam and oculus desktop VR games.The controllers are comfortable and so accurate it's scary, you also get hand tracking which works well. The controller battery is amazing, using it for over a week it's still at 100% I don't what kind of wizardry they have going on but it's great.ConsThe sound Quality isn't the best so get some headphones if you want better direction audio. Battery life could be better so if you plan on being standalone get the headstrap with battery kit from FB.All the controversy with the FB account to be honest is silly because you have to put some email and information on everything you use today so I don't care.Last thing Il say is that all the things FB when cheap on like speakers and headstrap, not adding Link cable and hardcase is so that they can add better hardware for a much smoother gaming and social experience.

  There is very little I can say here that hasn't already been said, except I LOVE THIS VR HEADSET !!  I've owned several VR headsets before, and this is the best one on the market, and fortunately it's very reasonably priced too.  If you haven't yet discovered VR, buy this immediately!  It's perfect, not only for hardcore virtual reality enthusiasts or gamers, but also the beginner.  It's very intuitive to operate, to learn and understand.  No PC needed.  No wires.  No external cameras you have to mount all over the walls.  Just take it out of the box and start having fun.  You can play amazingly immersive games, watch 3D movies, or 3D 180 degree or 360 degree videos, adult content, family friendly content, amazing creativity and artistic apps, educational experiences, relaxation and meditation experiences, attend concerts, go to virtual movies with other people and interact socially with others in many ways.  You can use the controllers, or in many cases use your hands (it tracks the position of your hands wonderfully).  You can even connect it wirelessly to your computer and have a virtual keyboard in VR that matches your own keyboard, and type on it.  Amazing.  The list of what you can do with the Oculus Quest 2 is huge, and growing fast.  Don't be left out of all the fun.  BUY THIS NOW.

  Ive had alot of fun with this thing. It was my first vr headset. Soon as i tried it out i noticed it was kinda blurry no matter how I adjusted the headset. But i was so amazed by VR that I let it slide and bought a few games. Then i downloaded sidequest and tried to up the graphics settings. Didnt make much of a difference. I downloaded the oculus software on my pc and tried plugging it in with a brand new anker cable and it says that it couldnt be upped passed the default 70hz and that my computer only had usb 2.0 ports. My computer itself says that the ports are 3.1, I looked on reddit and even people with the exspensive link cord were having the same problem... i tried playing boneworks and the headset seems like it can barely handle it. When i turn my head theres black screen tearing pretty often even on some games off of the oculus store and on my computer screen the game looks crystal clear but on the oculus its pretty darn blurry! Almost to the point that it hurts my eyes. Same thing with anyland i can barely even read anything but on the computer screen it looks great. Earlier the remotes randomly disconnected while i was trying to play and the screen wouldnt turn when id turn my head, i couldnt get them to reconnect until i hard rebooted it. Then the same thing happened again! So yeah this thing sketches me out big time. I looked on reddit and theres a ton of other people talking about how horrible the graphics are on it.  I would return it and get somthing else but I have spent like 150$ on games and accessories for it... its to late to get refunds on the games sadly.  So im not really sure what i should do at this point.

  I bought this device as an upgrade for my Oculus Rift S. In its default state, the only improvements I got from the Rift S was the finger tracking within the menu system and a better display. The straps that come with the Quest 2 remind me of a baseball cap on sale that feels okay to wear initially but becomes more uncomfortable and constricting the longer you wear it. After upgrading to the battery-less elite strap, thankfully this problem was for the most part alleviated.As far as the battery, on average I get 2-3 hours of playtime. Coming from a pcvr headset I expected to be stifled in this department but if this is your only headset expect your headset to die and find other things to occupy your time while it charges.The display is crisp. The upgrade in graphics was one of the single most influential pros that led to my decision to upgrade. Unfortunately, being that it is a standalone device, the display does get very warm and can grow to be hard to ignore as your face sweats from the heat of the device already sitting that close to your face.As far as build quality; the headset is composed of a hardy, durable plastic which some have expressed concerned about, but passes for a light to moderate user who is not careless with their things. I have not seen a drop test of this product but feel good about it dropping from head level without any cosmetic of functional failures.One of the biggest concerns about this headset is the lack of ipd adjustment. I do not recommend this product if your eyes are not close to the average persons in terms of pupil to pupil distance. The headset contains a 3 position slider and since the original rift headset, has been a major Oculus drawback for people who may not coincide with one of the three preset distance settings.At the end of the day the Oculus Quest 2 is a very affordable VR headset and should open the door for a lot of people to experience an at-home virtual reality experience; but for me it makes a great decoration on my wall as it watches me enjoy VR through the vessel of my Oculus Rift S.

  My son saved up his Christmas money and bought this for himself. I've used it and it's fun and easy enough for an 11 year old to set up and use with only minimal help. The image is clear and the immersive experience is realistic and engaging.The first drawback is that it doesn't come with any games. For this price, it should come with at least one. Instead, you must pay around $30+ per game. Second, the requirement of a Facebook account in order to use it is disappointing. I prefer that my son not be on Facebook for numerous reasons, but there is no way around it. Finally, the battery life for the controllers is poor. We've gone through so many AA batteries in a very short amount of time.Overall, it's great technology, very fun, and I'd recommend it with the former caveats.

  I was super excited for this product. I loved VR, but don't have a gaming computer, and it missed out on getting a quest when it was easily available. so when I saw there was a cheaper quest too I immediately jumped on it and pre-ordered. But yeah, this did not live up to even the lowest of my expectations. It is super cheap, but it feels super cheap. The price is an illusion, because you definitely can't rely on the standard head strap and we'll need to spend $50 to upgrade to the elite strap. and then with my glasses, this means I'll need a fit kit, although the fit kid apparently just has less padding which is barely adequate as it is. The three PD settings are tricky as well. I fall in between two and three, and as a result I'm noticing intense eye strain that I did not have on either the quest one or rift. I was so excited, I waited an eternity for this to come out. Now I'm just sad and disappointed.

Controllers vibrate.From what I've seen online, when it works out of the box, it is pretty straight forward.  Not my experience.

  I have tried the first Oculus Quest VR at a friends house and ever since then I wanted this!  I put it off for awhile and glad I did because now I have this and its another world.  I love it. I'm getting more exercise and I love the art and crafting games and I cant wait to shoot zombies. I also love the exploring games where I can travel the world while still being in my living room. I hesitated though for a week or so because I did not like that it would be attached to Facebook but I got over it.  I love it.  Its so much fun!!  I cant wait to try more games.

  Just a quick look at the specs and the price are enough to know that this is an incredible deal, but nothing prepares you for the experience itself. I upgraded to the Quest 2 from the Vive Pro, which cost me more than 3 times as much as the Quest 2, and the former wipes the floor with the latter. What very minimal screen-door effect there is is so slight that it is quickly ignored by the brain - something impossible with lower resolution or OLED screens, so immersion is on another level to previous generations of headset. This immersion will be further enhanced by apps supporting the controller-free hand-tracking mode, which literally brings your hands into VR. The forthcoming Infinite Office's ability to similarly bring a physical keyboard into VR will hopefully be extended to support keyboards other than the Logitech K830 demonstrated so far.

  Amazing device, blew my mind with its graphics. This happens to be my intro to VR. I would recommend for anyone. I get motion sickness from games where you actually have to move around without moving around so watch out for that. Games on oculus are much more affordable than your standard console games while being more fun in my opinion. I highly recommend Job simulator as a first game. My 2 only gripes are the speakers and hand tracking. the console tracks controllers like a charm, both sitting and standing, but hand tracking only fully works while standing and even then is prone to many bugs if you move too fast. En masse, I highly, HIGHLY, recommend this device to anyone with even a sliver of interest in trying VR.

  Was great the first day I had it. On day two the fan became extremely loud, I thought maybe the headset was just getting too warm so I gave it plenty of time to cool down but the noise was still there as soon as I turned it back on. Noise continued to get worse until it was very obvious at anything but max volume and also got worse whenever you turned your head. Do a quick search online and you'll see that several users are having this issue.

  I cannot complete setup of the unit because it is asking for a Facebook account. I have an Oculus account but do not have a Facebook account. Upon signing up for a new facebook account they want a copy of my ID. No thank you. After researching this it seems all your activity on your Oculus is shared by default and you have to specifically turn it off. Furthermore, if your Facebook account is deactivated for your own privacy or safety reasons (like domestic violence) you will lose all your Oculus purchases. This is just insane. Will be sending this back. Sorry Amazon, this isn't your fault but I'm not keeping a device which I cannot use without letting facebook 3D-map the inside of my house.

  This just arrived, we love it!  We've had experience with the earlier version of Ocular Quest, and this one is just as good, but also better in some ways. The hand grips are comfortable, and the goggles have a good range of vision in all directions. I personally like the white color better than the original black color, but I know that doesn't relate to performance.The Oculist Quest 2 performs well, responds rapidly, and gives a great VR experience. It's fairly easy to use, and comes with a few games to get you started. With 256gbs, it offers more than the earlier Quest models.I purchased this as a gift for my son, and after just one day, we are both enjoying it. I may get another for myself!

    True Next Gen
  
",5.0,Jordan,"Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2021","









  
  
    
  The Oculus Quest 2 is truly next gen. I have been a life long gamer for the past 35 years, beginning with atari. I have upgraded to the newest consoles whenever a new one was released. I did this up to the PS3, then kind of lost interest in games as I began to get bored of the graphics updates and not much else.With the way 2020 went, I no longer had my normal stress & exercise outlets. I heard good things about the Quest 2 & decided to get one a week after launch. As soon as I put it on, my mind was blown. I instantly transported to a different universe when I did the first steps tutorial. The experience was amazing. The controllers felt comfortable & intuitive. The headset took a little adjustment to get comfortable, but wasn't horrible. I definitely suggest upgrading to the elite strap or other 3rd party add on (like I did) to made the headset more comfortable & less 'front heavy'.The games are all reasonably priced with plenty of free games & experiences. There are routine sales in the Oculus store, so keep an eye on your wishlist games & pick them up when they are on sale. Most games are between $15 and $40. One of my favorite games is Walkabout Mini Golf and is only $15 at full price but offers an amazing mini golf experience with high replayability.I find that I'll get about 2 hours of battery life out of the headset, but have extended that to about 8 hours with the use of a power bank.I've read a lot of people complaining about the Facebook login requirement, but this is greatly exaggerated. These are the same people who don't realize their phones are already spying on them with or without Facebook. I've been in the technology industry for 20 years & realize that all my data is already being mined by many companies... It's the price of using technology.There is a bit of an adjustment period to VR known as 'getting your legs' which is similar to getting your sea legs. I found this was about a week or 2 before my brain understood the VR world was not real life. I do stick to mostly comfortable games where the movement is by teleport action since I've had real life motion sickness in the past. Fortunately, there are a lot of comfortable games available to people who are prone to moron sickness (For example, Arizona Sunshine offers teleport movement & I experienced zero motion sickness).My friends & family who tried the Quest 2 were blown away. My mother (in her 70's) thinks it's amazing. My friends bought a quest 2 & we now hang out in VR. It really feels like we are hanging out in person, which is really fun.If you are on the fence based on some of the negative reviews, I highly recommend the purchase. I haven't had this much fun with a new 'console' since opening my super Nintendo Xmas morning & popping in Street Fighter 2 back in the 90's.

  I had previous exposure to virtual reality (VR) with the Oculus Go at a local library and was impressed with the illusion of 3D immersion. I was never particularly interested in gaming consoles like XBox, PlayStation, or Wii.During our current sheltering in place, the facility where I was regularly playing ping pong/table tennis closed. Coincidentally I was hearing about the release of Oculus Quest 2 in October and that there was a program called Eleven for playing VR ping pong. This was the motivating factor behind my decision to purchase the Quest 2. Eleven is engaging enough that I can work up a film of sweat while playing and, in the absence of the real thing, I'm really enjoying it. Note: Eleven requires a minimum of 6.5' x 6.5' feet of clear space to play.If you're thinking of jumping into the VR experience, Quest 2 provides a solid introduction. Setup is very easy using the Oculus mobile app. Unlike the Oculus Rift which needs to be tethered to a computer, after setting it up, the Quest 2 is completely stand-alone.In addition to programs that are available for purchase, Quest 2 provides access to a lot of free content including programs that are handy for getting used to the VR environment, and VR videos that use 3D immersion technology. Many of the videos fall short of the resolution provided by HD or 4K TV but again, the illusion of immersion more than makes up for that.After a few rousing games of ping pong in Eleven, I'll sit down to cool off and let myself be amazed by the other VR experiences that Quest 2 offers. It's pretty fabulous!

The Quest store alone has a lot of games/apps enough to satisfy your appetite. And you have sidequest, which has literally 10x more games/apps compared to Quest store!Watching youtube (flat) using Quest 2 is really enjoying. Watching 6DOF movie, where you can walk inside the movie, is mind blowing. Playing games using 6DOF where you can walk around, pick up stuffs using both of your hands, are crazy immersive!

  I upgraded from quest 1 and there are many things that are different. The most irritating part for me is that the controlles are not as comfortable as quest 1. I play a lot of beat saber at expect+ levels so I immediately noticed that the controlles are not as accurate as the first generations. I missed a few notes that I usually don't miss. Additionally, controlles are too bulky for my hands and the home button is usually where I rest my thumb so I frequently touch the wrong buttons. It definitely will take me some time to get used to it. Hope future software updates can help increase the tracking accuracy.Other than that, the graphics are definitely better. Images are sharper and there are fixed ipd positions so never have to worry about the annoying ipd sign pop up during beat saber again.

  The device itself is awesome.  The titles and things you can do are pretty good.  I think it obviously needs more content.  The navigation is awesome.

Why should this device have anything to do with my existing facebook account?  I created a ""burner"" facebook account but didn't realize for the phone app that it will basically more or less force you to use your existing facebook app login.It's partly privacy because FB is terrible about privacy, but it's also just the weirdness of connecting some device like this with a facebook account.  I disabled all interactivity between my FB account and the oculus but I don't trust that FB isn't collecting data through the oculus.  Which is just weird.

I was hesitant to introduce yet another screen but this has been a life saver-figuratively and possibly literally.  The set up was easy. He plays for hours each day with people and I monitor the chats (you never know if there's crazy people out there).  He's physically active, visiting places all over the world, and playing all kinds of sports virtually.  The games can be pricey as well but I just assign extra chores so he can earn more money and buy the games.  Totally worth the investment.

  The Oculus Quest 2 is the real deal. It has clear visuals, a snappy interface, excellent stationary and roomscale tracking, and ergonomic controllers.New games, apps, and experiences get added to the Oculus Store every week, so you'll never run out of things to do. Also, if you have a high end PC, you can even play PC VR games like Half Life Alyx, Skyrim VR, and Fallout 4 VR by picking up the link cable or wirelessly (using the Virtual Desktop app).The only negative I can see with this headset is the requirement to have a Facebook account in order to use it, but that wasn't a big deal for me. The battery life also isn't spectacular, so I'd recommend picking up the Elite Headstrap with battery pack if you plan on playing for more than 2 hours at a time.Overall, this is an amazing VR headset for the price. If you're on the fence about picking this up, just buy it. You won't be disappointed.

    Steam issue & Link issue
  
",5.0,LanceSword,"Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2021","









  
  
    
  This is almost a perfect product. But I had a steam issue right out of the box. I contacted Oculus and they said I should buy anti-fogging spray to stop the fogging.  So to get around the design problem be prepared to shell out for  anti-fog spray or wipes. I eventually got a silicone protector with a nose guard and I no longer have the problem. It would have been nice to have that from the start, like the PSVR headset.I ordered a suitable oculus link USB-C cable for $30 and got the oculus link working. The biggest challenge was the AMD GPU drivers. The latest drivers prevented the oculus link working. I thought it was a problem with the cable - but no - it was the drivers all along. Spent hours on this issue...  so if you have this issue - roll back the AMD GPU drivers (search the web for full solution).This is a great product though and so glad I ordered it. It gave me headaches at first - but I got used to it now. It is like having two products - the wireless Quest mode and the Rift mode - which works with a host of PC applications.I am so happy with the performance in HL Alex and other steam games.  The Quest 2 games are also great and I am a big fan of the wireless experience. I also love the way I can buy the Rift version of a game and also get the Quest version (or the other way around). Google VR is mind blowing. Some of the fitness apps really get me sweating.The strap is ok. There are videos on how to get this right. I am sure the elite strap is great - but good luck finding it in stock. I also don't feel like paying another $50.  With the drawbacks I would give 4.6 stars - but there is nothing else like it on the market and there is so much you can do with this thing - so I will give it a full 5 stars. Would love for all my family to get one so we can all meet up in the cloud and chat...

What made me return the Oculus is the fact that you can't use multiple fb accounts on one headset without completely wiping it before signing into a different account. Oculus/Facebook would like every person in the household to have their OWN headset. Apparently there are ""plans"" to develop a multiple sign-on feature that was announced in August but there are no updates on that progression.

    An uncomfortable HMD with poor PCVR quality
  
",2.0,Gamefreak,"Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  $300 for a VR headset doesn't seem bad, right? Well, that would have been the price if the stock head strap that comes with this thing was of decent quality, but it's not. The head strap is made of a really grating elastic band that's pretty obnoxious to get sitting on your head correctly. It digs into your ears, causing physical pain. This leads to why the headset isn't actually $300.The ""Elite Strap!"" Yes, you need to spend another $50 to get a better head strap from the same company (which may or may not be why the stock head strap is awful). Ok, now we are at $350, not including tax. Well, if you want to play games on your PC through Steam, you are going to need to drop another $20-$80 on a USB C to USB C or A cable. Facebook and the Oculus team didn't even bother updating Oculus Link for their new product either, meaning the visual quality of PCVR games looks terrible through Link but decent enough in input latency adding programs like Virtual Desktop or ALVR. Anyways, that brings the headset up to $370-$430.At this point, you are probably thinking, ""Well, that's still not too bad!"" On the contrary, the face foam (the foam where the front of your face sits on to play these games) is of terrible quality and has the texture and firmness of a dish sponge. Imagine moving and jumping around for a few hours with a dish sponge scraping your forehead the entire time. Welp, that's another $10-$20 to swap out another uncomfortable component, bringing you up to almost $400-$450.I really wanted to like this product, but its sole purpose is to play games ON the device with the games you download from the Oculus Quest shop. It's great for that, but I cannot recommend this to anyone looking for a good PCVR setup. Get yourself a Rift S for that. Or if you have money to drop, check out the HP Reverb G2, which is pretty similar to the Valve Index for 3/5 the price and has Valve and Microsoft working on it.

Lots of free stuff for those on a budget, including home base rooms. Too fun. There is SO much more that i havent mentioned but you can find out yourself.

    Great way to get into VR
  
",5.0,Nathan Fawcett,"Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I love the Quest 2!  I've always wanted to get into VR, but it was always too complicated and expensive.  Finally the Quest 2 made it simple and relatively inexpensive.  No cables or sensors.  It's all in the headset.  And it just works. I have been playing it for a month now for at least a couple of hours a day, and everything has been great. The experiences you can have are like nothing else.  It can feel so real and immersive.  I love letting other people try and getting to see their reactions.  It's awesome!  I would definitely recommend it to anyone.There are only a couple of negatives I've run into.  One, there a not a ton of games available.  There are plenty to keep you busy for a quite a while and there are new ones coming out.  But there is not a lot of variety.  And I wish bigger games would make VR versions.  Still worth it though.  Two, the battery life is not incredibly long.  It usually lasts a little over 2 hours, but sometimes I want to play longer.  This can be remedied by getting the elite strap with battery or a third party battery like I did.  Three, the price of accessories.  I couldn't bring myself to pay for the elite strap with battery, even though I wanted it.  I did end up buying the elite strap by itself, because the strap that comes with it can get uncomfortable.  Unfortunately it broke within a week and it took 3 weeks to get a replacement.  That's ridiculous for something that costs as much as it does.  It is more comfortable though.All in all I still think it is an amazing product and well worth the price.

  I love this thing, 3d sound, top res on the market, but gosh its uncomfortable, in app purchasing is insane, and the lenses need some work. The face cover needs waaaay more padding and the head strap needs a complete makeover because its hurts really bad after an hour or so.. i hate that their accessories cost as much as the oculus itself and aren't default design upon purchase of the oculus, it makes no sense... little things like that degrade consumer confidence.The lenses have a halo affect when not in game and I can't seem to fix even with the PD functions but in game, it seems to disappear which i guess is ok. Accessories are extremely limited atm and game selection is very small though it is able to connect to a PC and expand your library but I think if oculus tried hard enough, they could integrate steamvr via cloud servers. Idk why they don't imbed xbox apps into the oculus either. If Microsoft and oculus worked together and integrated their cloud servers, they would easily overtake Playstation when it comes to vr. Also, why only white editions?... kinda seems like oculus is being very cheap...

  Great clear screen and resolution. Would be nice if the ipd was wide enough for me to see it without all the blur. A little disappointed they didn’t think it important enough to allow the headset to fit those of us who have already invested in the first quest and thousands of dollars worth of games. Seems like both the easiest feat in engineering and the most important. I’m sure it’ll fit most people alright. Also glasses fogged up immediately. Very small on my head and I’m not a big guy. Back it goes.

   I've played video games my whole life, but I have never experienced anything like the Oculus Quest 2.Everything you need is in this headset and controlled via two hand controllers.The games are so realistic that once you put the headset on, you forget where you are.Here's my son playing a virtual reality boxing game called ""The Thrill of the fight.""Overall, this gaming system is a masterpiece of technology.  It will require you to login with a Facebook account, and the system does not include any games.  Games are purchased virtually and range in pricing.  Some games can cause a bit of dizziness while playing, and others can give you an ultimate workout.  This is worth every penny for the experience you get when using, and I highly recommend it.  Therefore I rate this product five out of five stars.

    BEWARE if you wear GLASSES - this headset may not work for you.  Cost = $$ Paid + Your Personal Data
  
",2.0,Reader,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  I'm very disappointed with my Quest 2 because it doesn't adequately accommodate glasses.  The hole in your headset where your face goes is noticeably smaller than on the original Quest and the face hole on the original Quest was already smaller than most other headsets out there.  Even if I wear a small pair of glasses, the glasses get crushed on the sides and get stuck in the headset when I remove the headset.  After the glasses get stuck when taking off the headset they can fall into the VR lenses, which poses a scratch risk (mine hasn't gotten scratched yet).  The headset does have a spacer for glasses that moves the VR lenses a bit farther away from the user's face to accommodate the extra space needed for glasses between the VR lenses and the user's eyes, but this does not address the problem caused by the small opening.  Either Facebook/Oculus didn't adequately test for glasses wearers or they made the business decision to not serve glasses wearers well.  If I was the only one using the headset in my family, I might buy a special set of prescription lenses that attach to the headset.  However, my headset is used by others in my family, so that is not a realistic option.  Unfortunately, contacts don't work well for me, so that is not an option either.  I'm not yet sure what I'm going to do, but I'll probably end up returning the headset and buying the older model, a PSVR (which works great with glasses) or going without VR.Other than the glasses issue, I like the headset except for the requirement to use a Facebook account.  The true cost of the headset is the dollars you pay plus the personal data you share, not just the dollars you pay.

    Switched from PSVR to Oculus Quest 2.  Won't go back!!!
  
",5.0,RedmondIvy,"Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've owned the PSVR on Playstation since it came out.  Loved it, although, a few things that I have to  mention to help my comparison to the OQ2...1. Hated the cords constantly getting tangled.  Not only that but if you didn't take care of the cords once your done playing, over time they start to crimp and I was worried that at some point the internal wires would snap making the headset useless.2.  The 180 degree view.  Anytime I turned my head to far left or right, the tracking would go nuts.  Same with motion controllers, they would jump out of view and you'd have to shake it to get it to re-track.3.  The headset in my honest opinion sucked.  It was to tight.  I tried everything and eventually unhooked the rubber band straps on both sides.  This allow it to sit on my head without squeezing the blood from my brain.  This very fact was the main reason I got motion sickness.  Once I relieved that pressure, I no longer got sick while playing.4.  Screendoor.  Wasn't bad but noticeable.NOW... the OCULUS QUEST 2:Blown away.  No cables to mess with, resolution is clear and sharp, headset on my head doesn't squeeze the life out of my brain, no screendoor effect.1.  The headset.  Honestly, I was actually nervous to put it on.  I was afraid I'd put this thing on and I'd get sick like the PSVR.  NOPE!  I was shocked.  The headset fit on my head perfect, no pressure points cutting blood from my brain... I played for 2 hours straight and didn't get sick.  My face felt like the blood had drained due to the pressure on my cheekbones but overall, awesome.2.  I've never played VR with high resolution.  I'm used to the PSVR and screendoor.  Fuzzy words, FOV sometimes sucked.  The Quest 2..  wow.  I just wasn't ready for high resolution and everything so clear, easy to read, no screen door.  What a huge difference.  I can see why people fork out 1K on higher end VR units.  Worth it.  Which is why the Quest 2 is a shocking piece of tech for the price.  Can't beat it.3.  360 degrees.  Being so used to 180 degrees,  it was awesome when I drew my perimeter around the living room and could walk in any direction without cables tripping me up.  Sounds funny but it was liberating to stand, sit, crawl, jump and walk anywhere.  Again, blown away and wish I would have jumped to wireless sooner.So many other things that blew my mind and in my opinion it blows the PSVR away.  YES, PSVR does have some great exclusives BUT the Quest 2 has Steam and all the games from FB with Virtual Desktop.  It's just awesome.  No other words for it.  My son owns PSVR and put it on last night as well...  it ruined it for him.  He instantly wants to get rid of his PSVR and switch to Quest 2.  Just an awesome piece of tech for the price.  No regrets.

    Facebook has ruined the Oculus experience.
  
",1.0,David,"Reviewed in the United States November 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  The hardware is OK, and the technology has come along way, but Facebook has ruined the experience. Facebook now requires association with a single Facebook account per device. Forget sharing the device amongst family members.And to make matters worse, once a Facebook account is associated with a device, it is fused for the life of the device. Even a factory reset does not break the association. Facebook has done everything to assure use of their social platform and drive a device per person story over the experience of their customers.I don’t mind the availability of a social aspect of the Oculus, but Facebook is forcing it. I should not have to take additional steps to avoid social interaction if I simply want to use the device to play a game or enjoy an experience.  Also, why would I want Facebook tracking my every move on a game device.

    Quest 2 Was Worth the Wait
  
",5.0,N. R.,"Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2021","









  
  
    
  My family has been interested in VR for a while and I'm lucky enough to be able to demo the different hardware that's come out at work.  It's all been really cool but not yet ready to invest in purchasing a unit for my home and family until now.  Quest 2 256GB exceeding my expectations so far.  Had it for about a month and have mostly played DrunkNBarfight and Beat Saber so far. Love the games and you end up working up a sweat which is a nice bonus. I was not expecting to be able to get some limited exercise while playing the games but you really do!  The games load quickly, it has a great tutorial to learn, and it's cool connecting with your friends to play a game together.  It does a great job of creating a safe virtual space to play in.  Fit is comfortable but you have to fidget with some things when you swap the headset with another person.  Battery lasts over 2 hours of full play. Hasn't run out on us yet.  I'm super impressed with the hand held controllers. the haptic feedback is impressive and they work really well.A few suggestions:> It was hard to get the games to cast to my TV - I'm on a mesh network and I think that was part of the issue. Figured it out but it took a few hours of research and trail and error.> It's hard to find your ""games"" on the home screen. They are a few clicks away sometimes.  Oculus seems more focused on showing you what to buy than letting you jump right in.> They shouldn't require a Facebook account to use Oculus.  It's convenient because you can easily reach friends to play with and I would do it even if it was optional but it's the wrong kind of thinking by Facebook. This is why they will eventually broken up as a ""monopoly"".  I don't care because I'm on Facebook but it was a really short sighted decision by the people who made this amazing hardware. If you've been waiting to get VR this is the model to buy!

  I am not considered a ""gamer."" Sure, I love a good Mario bros or Tetris, I've played the Lego Wii games with my kiddo. I love the interactive platforms. I got a Wii when it came out and the Kinect on Xbox when it came out. I was pleased but not obsessed with these. I thought this purchase would be a fun toy to treat myself with during this crappy year. I AM OBSESSED. First, there was so much interactive and interesting free content to explore that it was a couple weeks before I even bought my first game. Watching content such as Amazon Prime, Netflix, and YouTube is INCREDIBLE. It feels like you are in a theater, which you have all to yourself, and it's easy to get lost in it and lose track of time. Watching Game of Thrones (which was never released in theaters) is AMAZING! There is some free VR content including YouTube360 and Amazon has a few VR options which are just amazing. You can explore the bottom of the sea and the peaks of the mountains, ride rollercoasters without waiting in line, and more. INCREDIBLE. I purchased my first game, Jurassic World, and I am just floored. While flying in an airplane, you can walk up to the window and look out at what you are flying over. You can literally peak your head around corners before entering rooms to look for raptors. Getting attacked by a raptor is a little heart stopping! Lol I cannot recommend this more!! I am more than pleased with my purchase!!

  This is a great headset but here are some of the things that caught my eye:- Why do I need FB account to play and have some fun?- Why do I need to create an avatar when I am not playing games that require avatar?- The keyboard is something new, I guess eventually you will tell Alexa or your device and AI will do the magic, right now you have to type and it seems weird- Very limited experiences because of how hard FB has made it for others to submit their experiences- The straps are really cheap quality, mine started wearing out after 2 days.- Complicated process to play games from other platform- A lot of people in the review mentioned that if you get banned for no reason on FB then basically the device is useless. Honestly, I am not a big fan of FB and don't like limitations so I will buy Steam VR so I can experience other games and avoid all the bs associated with FB stuff.The idea is great and I think it's gonna change how we learn but the fact that I am forced to sign up for FB is what's not so cool about it. I have a friend who was banned on FB 5 years ago because FB thinks he's not a real person and he can't get Oculus because if he does and he creates a new account they will ban him and his device will be useless.

  I haven’t been this excited about a product in awhile. It’s incredible!! I got it for my kids but bought myself one when I saw what it can do. I never play video games, I’ve been to the movie theater once since 2014, and watch one tv series a year, so I’m not really into this stuff usually. But after seeing VR I’m hooked. I love being able to travel to art museums, see historical sites, watch documentaries with  iMax feeling, travel through space. I had no idea what could be done with VR or why Facebook paid a fortune for Oculus until now. I could see this replacing other forms of home entertainment—why watch a tv, or use a game console, or even surf the web on your phone, when the VR experience is so much better.

  I wanted to get this last year - but decided that the price point was too high for something that I wasn't too sure about.  At the $300 price point, this year I decided it was worth the gamble.  Every member of my family was absolutely blown away.  This is EXTREMELY realistic.  I'm amazed that we can have access to this level of technology for $300.Biggest limitation/criticism is the battery.  Takes about 2-hours to fully charge.  A fully charged battery lasts about 2-hours.  For kids that don't habitually limit themselves to appropriate, finite periods of screen time, these 2-hour limits are actually a blessing in disguise.  But it is frustrating when you want to use it only to realize that someone just drained the battery and now you have to wait.Other criticism is that it doesn't utilize any sort of ""account"" system.  Unless the individual games have their own, individual save files, it does not really accommodate, say, having multiple people do their own campaign in Beat Saber.  Also, I'm OK with having to tie this into my facebook account - you can disable all of the connections that would make typically make this annoying.  I just don't like the fact that when my wife and kids starting using it, they basically have access to my facebook account when they do.  However, since they're only playing games, it doesn't really end up being that big of a deal.
