    Very Reliable wifi extender
  
",5.0 ,Ken,"Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  The range extender works beautifully to extend my signal.  The only thing I had problem with is turning it into MeshAi with Asus router.  not compatible but now buying the TP-Link router which should make it compatible to have same SSID for router and Extender.Keeps signal and never dropped.very happy

    10x Speed in 2400 sq ft house
  
",5.0 ,Jean Martin,"Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2021","









  
  
    
  We have Fios GB to the house, two story house with basement, about 2400 sq ft. The Fios router is more or less right in the middle of the main floor so signal is pretty solid both 2.4hz and 5.0Ghz throughout the house with full bars of Wi-Fi almost everywhere. My computers are in the room with the Wifi router, so I've never had issues on wifi. My wife was getting some sporadic issues upstairs, and so we thought we'd try this option to see if it would help. I wasn't very optimistic it would make a big impact, but I plugged it in yesterday and her computer up there went from a Speedtest of 11Mpbs to 115Mbps. Choppy performance and Zoom issues gone.  Now I'm getting another one for the basement because the signal consistency is nowhere near as good as I had thought.This was the 1200 Mbps max version, which I bought over the 750 Mbps version thinking I'd want the extra headroom. I think the $30 TP Link version would do probably as well, but this one is really performing well.

  I bought this to extend the signal range beyond the confines of my house so i could use wireless components outside by as much as 20 feet or maybe more, since i have a large yard beyond the house.  it seems to do nothing of the sort, and hardly seems to do more than take up a small amount of space at an outlet.  I can't recommend this for anything.

    Not easy install. But Works Great!!!
  
",4.0 ,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States April 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I first tried to install using the ""Tether"" app on my iPhone, but the instruction sheet that came with the device left out some steps. Apparently, they assumed (incorrectly) that I already had a TP-Link account, which I had trouble setting up from the App. It kept giving me internet connection errors. I considered calling tech support, but there is none. All support is via their website. So, I went to Option 2 and set it up via a web browser on my computer. This worked fine and I was up and ready to locate the extender in a few minutes.My wi-fi router is located in my office in the front of the house. I have always had trouble getting good solid wi-fi coverage on the back lanai, around 60 feet from the router with several metal stud walls in the way. I first located the new extender around 50 feet from the router, close the back lanai. A minute and a half after plugging it it, ""Voila"" all the lights came on indicating it was getting a good signal from the router and was transmitting both bands successfully.I have tried web surfing, online gaming and file downloading on the lanai and it is as if I'm in the office right next to the router. Couldn't be more happy!

  It will make a mess for your phone to log in your Wi-Fi. Even you put in wifi password correct but somehow it will not work. You will get error messages saying wrong password. I have tried to reset factory on the phone couple times to get back to normal. Setup took two hours make me run around in circles. Finally I give up. Return. I no need technical support because I want something ez enough to set up in 5 minutes max. Tp link is a joke.

    Product doesn‚Äôt work consistently - splits bandwidth
  
",2.0 ,Tene Baker,"Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  Update: 6/8/20 After having this for a few weeks I‚Äôve realized it actually makes my internet worse. It seems to split the bandwidth so none of my network connections work very well. Not a good solution for my house.Original post: It‚Äôs very frustrating that this worked when first installed and then doesn‚Äôt work later.  This isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôm really using often. It‚Äôs for the rooms at the farthest corner of my house. They are only used if my son or grandkids are over and using the WiFi. The problem is that I don‚Äôt want to have to trouble shoot it every time they happen to need it. It‚Äôs too late then. I need something that works all the time. I go to use it with FireTV and it can‚Äôt find any network. Everything else in my house - including other fire Tv and echo boxes are working so this is just too far away and extender doesn‚Äôt do it‚Äôs job consistently.

It‚Äôs WiFi connection is just so unstable. It keeps dropping my devices ! What‚Äôs worst was I was blaming my internet service provider... cause I thought it was my internet . So to make sure , I did a process of elimination. First what I did to make sure is I disconnect all my devices from the extender. Then I connect my laptop to the main gateway and run speed test. It work and has aDecent result. Then disconnect my laptop from the main gateway and connect it to the extender... it did connect to the extender and says strong signal but there was no internet going through! It just says loading and any website won‚Äôt go through. So dissatisfied and to think I am only connecting 1 device?!

  Installation was easy enough with the phone app. But once installed and working, it didn't make a bit of difference. We tried it close to our wifi router, across the room, and in two other rooms.

  We are two adults working at home due to the COVID19 pandemic. Our dual home offices have between us two Windows 10 laptops, one Chromebook, two laser printers, two ink jet printer two 10 inch high performance tablets, two mobile phones, and an eBook reader. There is a lot going on here so range extension is important.This product did not perform to expectations and we cannot recommend it for environments similar to ours. Your experience may be different depending on you home network setup and what you are doing with it.  I am listing below the issues we encountered with the product. Overall, the device cost me a morning of work time that had to be made up in the evening.1. The photo online showed an Ethernet input for direct CAT-5 connection to the router. The delivered product didn't have one., However the setup process was clear and it worked but with unintended consequences.2. On installation the product crippled the router WiFi service by turning it off manually and wiping out the wireless connection to one of the home office printers. The printer had to be re-installed from scratch. WiFi has to be turned back on by connecting a laptop to the router via CAT-5 cable, logging in to it, and turning on the WiFi manually.3. After restoring the router WiFi services, and re-installing the printer, the tp-link product install process worked without creating a new round of issues and so did the range extender service. However, there was a huge speed penalty downgrading a 100 Mb/Sec Wifi connection on the 5G service to 35 Mb/sec on the home WiFi.  That' s not bad but it isn't what we wanted nor what was advertised.4. I have abandoned the use of this product and instead I am using a Netgear range extender which works fine even though it also slows down the signal, but not as much as the one from TP-Link. Note that the Netgear range extender install process isn't as easy as the one from tp-.link. It does have an Ethernet port.5. I was not able to reach tech support staff at the company to discuss these concerns due to long wait times. While online help is available, I felt these problems required direct contact with tech support.

  Tried the three different steps that came with the unit.  I could not get it to work, would not show connected but was visible on the computer and could connect.  Went through these steps over and over.  I went to the back of the instructions and three steps with the phone, it actually said it was connected but still no indicator lights.  Went ahead and moved the extender to another room, made contact with it on the computer and all the lights came on.  Can not explain why or how this took place but we will see if it works and keeps the security camera working.

  Buy a MESH SYSTEM. These extenders basically take a bad signal and stretch it a bit more, some of the time. Do it right with a mesh system...yes they cost a good deal more...but you're investing in the result and you'll do the job once instead of the trying time and again, wasting the time and energy, on these wannabe solutions. I bought an EERO system and it's amazing. Do it once, remove the frustration and high cortisol levels out of your life.

",4.0 ,Bruce M,"Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  If you contact them. ""It works on pretty much all routers"".  Yes and No. It is only mesh with their mesh routers, Maybe two devices. With All others. It works as an extender. If you choose the same SSID. You will have drop outs if you walk around. If you have ring cameras and a power outage; It may or may not connect to all of the remote cameras. I have to reset my Doorbell camera when this happens or I never know what it is connected to. The APP is good at telling You but you are forced to reboot the camera to get it to hook to the more power full signal. BUT it does work.... I have a Neatgesar nighthawk. It does work. I use the same SSID and for the most part have no issues.

  So far I'm satisfied the TP-Link products I've purchased have allowed my Wi-Fi to work better throughout my home. It allows stronger signal strength to reach from one end to the other connecting the farthest item's from the router keeping them connected. This recent purchase TP AC1200 has my bedroom TV and backyard camera working better than ever before with it's placement. Of course it all depends on our internet provider and how they mess with customers signal strength like it's a joke. But this has kept the strength up and working.

  I live in a 2 story home that isn't very big. However, my room is almost a dead zone. I get a ok signal with 2.4GHz and almost no signal with 5Ghz. I can't move anything in my room since where the main router is is in the master bedroom with a shower and lots of walls in the way.I've upgraded my PC Wi-Fi and it barely helped. Did some research and while some tell me Wi-Fi extenders don't really work. I needed to do something and not run a 100ft ethernet cable.Found this one since we currently use other TP link products and gave it a go. After a simple set up. I did a speed test and noticed a huge improvement! Not only was I getting signal. I was at full bars instead of 1 or no signal. Being on 5Ghz really has some good speeds. Especially since I am constantly uploading photos or streaming HD videos.Highly recommend this product and might buy more or get it for my parents since they have a similar issue in their home.

I've thought about getting a few more of these just to make sure that the signal is as high as it can be in the house.But I would recommend this device to anyone that was needing them.

  I've got a corner of the house that often has trouble with wireless signals. Even with what looks like a strong signal, the connection drops periodically. Here's the two big important things to keep in mind:1) Setup - Follow the instructions. There's three ways to set it up, choose the one you want. I used the app and the extender's ad-hoc wifi setup and had it up and running less than five minutes. I'm not sure if this is because I'm already using a One Mesh router (TP-Link Archer A7), but just follow the instructions.2) Location, Location, Location - The sweet spot for placement seems to be right where your wireless starts showing a less-than perfect signal. Further than that, and it will tell you to relocate it. Remember that wireless signals pass through different materials with varying effectiveness.Follow the instructions and choose a good location and this will make your home network work better.

  This TP-Link RE300 Range Extender is a breeze to set up to my Archer A7 and a pleasure for bringing WIFI to every nook and cranny of my home. Multiple users enjoy the signal now, with over the top signal strength and generous bandwidth for streaming live - up and down! I can't believe that such a humble solution to WIFI coverage is so inexpensive. And it links transparently to the smart APP 'Tether' for the perfect router and range extender management experience. Thanks (again), TP-Link!

    Good Range Extender
  
",4.0 ,MarkL,"Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is a good range  extender. It is better than what we had before but only complaint is that it can't get as far away from the main router as I would like even though the mobile app says that it's in a perfect place for signal.  My Fire TV stick says the wifi signal is just ""good"".  We do like the way it plugs into a wall outlet and takes up no space - that's a real plus.

  I ordered a new product, but the one I received had a mailing label on it indicating it had been shipped from a UPS location in Tulsa, OK to an Amazon return center in Lexington, KY.  I had trouble trying to connect to my network because it had previously been configured to another network.  After quite a bit of frustration, I was able to reset it and configure it to my network.  So far, it seems to be working OK, but time will tell how well it works.

  If you don't have a large company supporting your wifi, i.e. spectrum, at&t, Verizon,  it's a waste of money. We live out in the middle of nowhere so we are only able to have small modems...

  Our modem and router are in the computer room on one end of the house but we still get a fair signal in the kitchen and den on the other side but it disappears on the deck.We lived with that until we got a smart TV to replace our old plasma in the den. Our options were: 1, a new router,  an extender, or mesh. Since the extender is the cheaper alternative it was the easy first choice.Bottom line the TV is almost trouble free and I can even get mad at the news on the deck now.

    Can not create extended wi-fi with normal 2-band router
  
",1.0 ,Greg Hammersley,"Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this after extensive reviews of other products.  Two problems:  1) easy installation was not the case. I went through the ""easy"" steps and was not able to connect at all. This extender could not recognize my ATT U-verse router because it had a 2.4 Ghz band and a 5 Ghz band.  Most routers also use the 2-band system.  I called TP-Link tech support and went through a laborious process that required me to split my ATT wi-fi into two separate bands, 2.4 and 5 Ghz. I then had to create two additional bands for the TP-Link to use.  I then had 4 different bands to select from on my wi-fi.  This was as the TP-tech instructed me to do. He said this was an ""advantage"".  It was not.  Every time I went to a different area of the house I would have to switch to a different wi-fi band.  Quite the PITA!  I have since purchased the Google wi-fi mesh system.  Quick and easy install and blazing fast speeds all over my house!!

    Didn't Measure Up To Its Hype
  
",2.0 ,Tom,"Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2021","









  
  
    
  After reading the marketing information I thought all I had to do was plug in the device near the router; press the WPA button once for each band then move it to a location between the router and the area that has weak reception. Up to that point it worked according to the description but after that nothing happened. According to the hype the signal would be closer and stronger so the devices in the house would automatically connect. This did not happen; the app showed no clients which told me that the devices saw nothing stronger than my router. The one issue that made me quickly give up on the device is my Roku. The Roku is ~30ft from the router on 2.4 GHZ and I put the device between the two where it was ~10 ft from the Roku. The signal strength from the device and from the router were identical. The Roku listed the download speed at 19 MBS without the device and 9 MBS with the device.This was always a nice to have and not have to have device. I was not going to spend hours/days on this so it was returned. From opening the box to boxing it back up took me an hour.Stars were given for looks and simplicity in setting up.

  We've been looking at home internet options so that we can give Comcast the finger on the way out the door. We're currently testing an option, but the connectivity seemed slow and spotty. I'm not expecting Comcast speeds, but a more stable connection would be acceptable. I bought this unit based on ratings, cost, and ease of install/use. I wasn't expecting a miracle...and I certainly didn't get one. Did it boost our wifi? Yup...a whopping 5mbps average when it actually worked.Maybe I just need a better, stronger version of this‚Äîbut this one didn't do any of what the product description led me to believe.

  We recently switched to Comcast for internet and when they came to hook us up they basically told us Verizon (who we had previous but cancelled because our contract was up) had better signal than they did so where we had the router, we'd probably get weak signal in the living room.  After dealing with losing signal frequently for a week, i went and bought this.  LIFESAVER.  Now we have no issues with the TV losing signal.  Our phones and tablets sometimes have issues but I don't know if that's the internet failing or this.

  First bullet in product description says: Extend Wi-Fi Coverage - Boosts Internet Wi-Fi Coverage up to 1500 Square feet and connects up to 25 devices - Compatible with any Router, Gateway, Access PointSo I configured this to connect to an Access Point, which does not handle DHCP. It was simple to configure and appeared to work. I placed it in the location of the house I wanted it after it was setup and when attempting to connect to it receiving a DHCP error. So it appears to me this does NOT in fact support Access Points. An access point is not a router, it doesnt do DHCP, for whatever reason this thing is unable to receive DHCP from the actual router which is on the opposite end of my house so it is too far away to get a good signal. Looks like I will be returning this.To sum up, if you are expecting this product to meet its product description you may end up disappointed.

  We have been using this cooler for about a week now. I was concerned because I read some reviewers complaining about the noise. I have to say, I don't consider it to be noisy in the least! I never expected a water cooler to be silent, and the sound that this one makes I do not consider to be even remotely loud. Additionally, it only makes a sound when you use it, and for about 15 seconds after to replace the water in the tanks inside. The entire family is very pleased, and my wife and I are happy because it's considerably less expensive per week than single bottled water. We use about a 5-gallon bottle a week, and we used to use between 1-3 cases of bottled water a week. I think the difference is, there is a lot less waste drinking per cup. The kids would drink half a bottle, leave the half empty bottle around, and then take new, cold ones.

  This device would be great for a starbucks or another coffee shop,restaurant, if you just want to extend the network and don't care to secure your network beyond even a password.  Don't buy this if you use the methods below to secure your network.Everyone knows to use a password on your SSID right.  What happens when a hacker in 30 minutes cracks your password?  They have full access to your network.  To secure my network, I assign the ip addresses manually in my router and only assign enough ip address to cover my devices.  (I have 36 devices wifi and ethernet)  To further frustrate a hacker, I also only allow the mac addresses to join that are assigned also in the router.  I also use other network security methods which I won't mention here.I had this up and running in 15 minutes but suddenly, the devices were loosing internet connectivity.  Upon investigating, the device created random mac addresses that ""bridge"" the connection between your router this device and your device.  So all the new mac addresses that weren't authorized on my router, suddenly were blocked.  Contacted tplink support by chat, person started to walk me through their b.s. script and I told them that I had advanced certification in networks and ""here's the problem"".  The tech contacted a higher level support which directed me to an article on how to stop the device from creating the random mac address and to pass through the mac address.  Unfortunately, I was then told, ooops this article doesn't apply to your device because we cannot turn off the feature on your device.  If you do a search for ""device connected to extender are showing wrong MAC address"" you'll see the issue in detail.Now here's where it's stupid.  I asked the person, which of your extenders have the feature that can be turned off?  The person again talked to their higher support level, came back and said, sorry, we don't have any devices that will turn off the virtual mac address and pass-thru your mac address.  At this point I asked (just in case the person was stupid) so your telling me I need to shop with another vendor even though I'm asking for your help to buy a possibly even more expensive product that will work for me?  The person said again sorry we don't have anything that has the capability to shut that off.So I  fixed the issue for almost free by moving my access point from my entertainment system cabinet to a height of 7feet and mounted it to the wall.  Yes it looks like crap, but I get great signal right through 4 walls.  I had to buy two 15ft cat 6 shield cables from monoprice on amazon and use an old 100base t switch in my entertainment cabinet to hook up my 5 devices sitting in there.

  Unboxing, setup, and operation went as expected with quality packaging.  Documentation was easy to follow.  I didn't want to download the app to my phone just to set up the extender, and thankfully there's an option to allow it to be set up using a web browser.  My complaint, however, is a big one (to me).  I wanted the extender to connect to the main SSID but transmit a different ID, which it can do.  Unfortunately, the extended SSID is required to have the same password as the main SSID, which is not what I wanted.  I wanted a separate SSID with a unique password, and apparently this box will not do that.  But if you plan to extend (keep) the main wifi SSID name or don't mind the wifi password being the same for all SSID's, this is a 5 star system.  Perhaps a future firmware update will allow the passwords to be different.

So I tried to download their app.  The phone said it downloaded and installed the app, but I couldn't find it.  (This isn't my first rodeo.)So I went to their website hoping to find a customer support number. I answered a couple of questions on a simple form and I got a response in CHINESE; only in CHINESE!  (or maybe some other Asian language?)If this sounds like fun to you, disregard my advice.

  Internet signal was weak in my basement for gaming and so I purchased this based on reviews and articles I found. Plugged it in, downloaded the Tether app, and it did everything for me basically. Created a password for the extender.. made it the same as the router to avoid confusion. Now there is no lag when my ps4 is on the ext network and others can stream in the house with no problem. Good product so far.. does what I expected. Tech support is 5 stars because I didn‚Äôt need any.

  Bought this unit to boost Wi-Fi signal in weak area of house. The installation took about two hours and was extremely frustrating. I don't understand the other reviews that describe it as easy. After downloading the install app on my phone, my first attempt to capture the signal failed because my phone couldn't detect the Wi-Fi output. This part took a while to resolve with my phone settings. Then the extender couldn't detect the signal from my phone. After another hour of retries (at least five or six) the extender finally decided to work. The result: the signal improvement is marginal at best. Conclusion: you're better off just getting a better Wi-Fi router.  BTW- here's a dirty little secret- these install apps are an unnecessary complication designed to allow these companies to gain your info in order to spam you. My first router didn't need an app- I just plugged it in and it worked fine.

  Great WiFi Extender!This device helps extend the wifi in our home to difficult to reach sections of the house. However, sometimes the signal becomes inexplicably weak and the smart TV will drop off or has very weak wifi it keeps buffering. Doesn't happen all the time so I am unable to pinpoint what the issue is. All in all I think it is a very good addition if your  router wifi is not reaching all corners of the house. The best part is the mesh it creates with your wireless router and uses the same name and password as the existing wireless network. This makes it easier for connected devices to seamlessly switch from one to the other. I  am using a TP-Link AC1750 and it works very well with this Extender.  I will definitely recommend it.

  Up and running in no time. But don't look to be blown away. WiFi Router is upstairs, this Extender is placed downstairs at an acceptable spot, verified BT TP-Link app. Overall speeds have doubled the dead zone. On my 5G, when in the same room as router, speed test results are around 100 to 120 Mbps and about 18 to 20 Mbps when I'm downstairs. With the TP-Link range extender speeds are about 28 to 40 Mbps. So it helps, but it's not going to give the same speeds as if you're close to the source itself.

I read the instructions, installed the App and within 20 minutes, I was up and running with Wi-Fi in my detached garage/office about 2 bars (from 2 to 4 bars) stronger than before. I've used other extenders over the years but this was the least expensive, easiest to install and with the best outcome.

  Super easy to install. I have a Netgear AC1200 dual band router and this took 3 minutes to set up. 2.5 minutes of the setup was just me reading through  the instructions. The actual setup was just plugging in the mesh, pressing the WPS button on my router, pressing the WPS on the mesh, and the pressing the WPS buttons again for the 5 GHz band. Didn't need to install or download anything.As far as signal, I haven't had any issues. I have my router set up in the livingroom and the mesh in the kitchen about 50 ft (15 m) away and I'm getting full signal in the bedrooms upstairs for both 2.4 and 5 GHz.The only ""con"" I could think of is that the instructions list downloading the app as their ""method 1,"" which forces you create an account with your email. Method 3 was the one I used which involved just pushing two buttons and waiting for the lights to stop blinking. Sure, I might be ""missing out"" on the app exclusive features, but hey, it's a wifi mesh. What more do I need it to do other than extend my wifi range. Not much I need an account and app for.

  This little gem works very well.Received on 14 days ago.  The far end of my rather long ranch house was a near dead zone for the wireless signal so I upgraded from an older Netgear extender.  Installation was super quick using the rather large instruction sheet, which was mostly images, and the iOS app.  Total install was less than 10 minutes.  The dead zone is gone and the entire house is speedy.  The unit was installed sideways as that is how the outlets in my house are orientated but that does not seem to have any noticeable effect.  I would have expected some impact as that changes the orientation of the internal antennas, but if it does it is not readily visible.

  This is a cheap solution and you get what you pay for.  Yes, it extended my wifi signal, but only for a short distance beyond what it was before.  My wifi modem./router is upstairs, I needed to extend the signal horizontally throughout the downstairs.  But, the extender is not strong enough to get a better signal to the two areas that were lacking.  I had to decide to put in a location that improves the signal in one area and it does nothing for the other area.  If a modest, limited improvement is all you need, this may do the job.  If not, do the research, spend more money, and buy a real solution.

  If I had written this review within the first month I purchased it, it would have received a 5 star review. It was easy to set up/install, and had multiple devices in my home connected to WiFi smoothly at one time. Easy peasy.....Then.... it didn't work.  I have no idea if the iOS 14 update did something here, but I have the app for this product on my iPhone. Right after I did this update, this product no longer connected to my host device. When I opened the Tether app, there was a message about some configuration that would need to be changed due to the update, and I wish I screenshot this because the second I clicked elsewhere on the app this message disappeared.  It said I would need to turn off my cellular data in order to reconnect.Anyhow- I just figured I could reconfigure the device and reconnect. Nope. Although the product gives out a signal and sometimes is detected by the app, I can not get it to pick up the host device. I have attempted to reset the extender multiple times. I attempted to reconnect the extender and host device through the WPN buttons. Nope.  I had the cellular on and off my phone to see which might actually work while trying to reconnect this thing, all with no luck whatsoever.  I contacted ""customer service"" for tplink.... what a waste of time that was, and after 45 min of virtually no help whatsoever, they disconnected from the call!Now I think I understand what the ""tp"" in their brand means. So frustrating!  I hate to be so wasteful both in money and with items heading to landfills...but there is no other appropriate place for this.  I am now waiting for a Netgear brand extender and hope for the best!

  So, upfront, I am using the RE300 in conjunction with a TP-Link Archer A7 router as part of TP-Link's OneMesh system. So I don't have any experience using it as a generic range extender, but I'm sure it's great with how it's performing as a mesh network so far.It was incredibly easy to set up. Just plug it in, connect to its network, and follow the prompts on the Tether app. After set-up, I relocated the extender in my upstairs hallway. That was where we've been having the most problems, especially the bedroom on the opposite side of the house from the router. Before the new router/extender combo, we were getting maybe 23 - 30 mbps; if we could connect at all. Now we have download speeds of up to 150 mbps! With that kind of improvement, that's worth the investment to me.

    Alters Your Client MAC Addresses Complicating DHCP Reservation

  Unlike other TP-Link extenders I've used, this one alters your client MAC addresses...a ""feature"" that cannot be disabled. If you use DHCP reservation on your router, this MAC alteration complicates matters if you ever plan on switching back and forth between the extender WiFi SSID and the original router WiFi SSID...you will essentially have two different MAC addresses for the same client which means you won't be able to use the same IP for DHCP reservation. After conferring with TP-Link support I can confirm that this MAC alteration ""feature"" cannot be disabled.Unfortunately this is a show-stopper for our setup that will force me to return this product.

Once moved to their final locations, the extenders were very effective in overcoming my range issues, providing wi-fi speeds throughout that matched throughput in the room where the router is installed.

  Our Internet cable is in the basement, so our router is installed there. The main floor has had dropout areas for a couple of years. We replaced our old range extender at that time with a newer version of the same brand and model, hoping that our coverage would return to when we first purchased the range extender. The dead spots were reduced but not gone. I recently ordered the TP-Link AC1200 hoping it would link to the range extender to end dead spots on the main floor. When it was clear that it needed to connect to the router itself, I doubted the signal upstairs would be strong enough for the AC1200 to work.Surprise - it works beautifully. Our main floor has never had better or faster coverage. The TP-Link AC1200 was also less expensive than the less effective range extender. I wish I'd made this purchase earlier!

    Excellent Coverage for Separate homes

  As a disclamer, yes, I do have more technical knowledge and I am full-time in IT industry. Which may lead many to expect that I prefer more expensive brands of equipment to strain the best optimal performance per dollar. However, the budget and circumstances I am currently experiencing have made me decide on a lesser of two options.Yes, I have considered the google wifi mesh pucks, but, the always on microphone and the thought of google following me throughout the house bugged my paranoia senses and I opted for a piece of hardware that would put a focus on 'performing' rather than being 'innovative'.The current setup, the main house we live behind has a stock, all-in-one Docsis 3.0 cable modem with WiFi. Prior to the upgrade, we used a Linksys RE2000 WiFi extender. The previous extender 'worked' but tapped at a mediocre 1.8mbps down and 0.8 up speeds. This is part 1 of upgrading the wireless experience in the guest house as the construction for internet runs on a DSL connection (were too far for service) and satellite (too pricey for yearly subscription). After a few WiFi analysis runs, I found that the wireless signal would broadcast from inside the house to the outer rim of our pool (length of the pool is 55ft). We have an outlet on the outside of our house covered by a storm cover which is signal enough to catch a good signal (WiFi analyzer bars were in the green) and repeat both the 2.4ghz and 5.0ghz signal.Now -- onto the review of the device.The TP Link WiFi extender is an excellent purchase if you are looking to build a Wireless Mesh network for your backyard/backhouse. This device does not support a wired connection, which, considering most networked devices in the home run on WiFi, can be a good or bad thing. If you prefer for devices in the home with ethernet connections to be connected via ethernet, consider using a over power line device (carries the signal through your outlet). I considered a similar solution in my case, but the wiring and time involved did not justify the speeds. your mileage may vary.Since the AC1200 WiFi extender does not have an ethernet connection, initial setup requires a cell phone with a decent signal and the use of their TP Link tethering app. While I was skeptical, I continued with the setup, which requires patience on behalf of the end user. Registering, downloading, syncing and then connecting can take an upwards of 30 minutes. To shave some time off of the overall process, I kept my existing wifi extender up, connected to it, ran the configuration through the tether app, then swapped the devices. I tested the signal and found we had whole house WiFi for a  930~ sq 1 bedroom back house. I connected other devices, then with some minor adjustments, found that all devices were clocking in a decent 9~10mbps down and 2mbps up speeds.These are exceptional to watch HD streams with some loading, light browsing and downloading of pdfs,ebooks and moderately large files.A few options to consider, I am running this WiFi extender across a decent sized pool, with a Docsis modem that is connected in a closet on the inside of the main house. I'd estimate the signal from the modem to the guest house front door drops to 1 bar signal.A few things to consider:  1. This is a WiFi extender, a powerful one for the price. You will not get 'excellent' speeds the further you are away from your main hub and bouncing multiple extenders off of each other will diminish the speeds. Consider using this for end-to-end coverage of a large home or to push the signal out of an older router/modem. 2. Setup is simple enough if you have a few things on hand, namely your WiFi password, decent connection on your cell phone and a good position for the extender to be plugged in.3. If you are trying to extend the signal to another house/guest house please see below for some suggestions.Final thoughts & WiFi part 2 After dealing for about 6 to 8 months with the old Linksys WiFi extender, I expected to see drops in video quality, bandwidth issues and below average connectivity. By plugging in this WiFi extender to 'upgrade' an existing device over 3+ years old, I nearly doubled performance and coverage in under a half hour. Considering that there is another family with wireless devices closer to the main router, part 2 of my project is to provide an entirely separate wireless router on another SSID to separate bandwidth. Currently, my thought is a single wireless signal hosting 10+ devices (4 laptops, 7 cell phones, 4 tablets, 2 smart t.v.s and 1 console) will continue to struggle unless another private SSID is utilized to better organize the signal. To do this, I opted for a TP Link AC1200 WiFi router, with a hidden SSID to connect the backhouse WiFi separate from the main home. Its in my experience that a 'guest' wifi and a 'internal' WiFi will have varying degrees of performance based on those connected to the signal so its my hope of a dedicated router to extender will improve not only the speeds but dedicated coverage in the guest house.

  So far it appears to be working well, was very easy to set up, however I am not noticing a substantial improvement in the Wi-Fi signal. There is a marginal difference, however this may be due to the fact that we did not have a complete dead zone when trying it. Very easy to install, and works in different locations in the house without any signal compromise. I would recommend this device for a smaller house where you have a diminish signal, but may not work well in larger homes where are the Wi-Fi signalIs completely gone. You may want to invest in a more expensive and effective extender for those cases.

Not too expensive...provides a nice strong signal. The only tip I can give is go right to to Tether app for installation. I tried both other methods 1st without success. So, to avoid frustration, start with the app.

  If you‚Äôve got a gaming set-up in a dead spot go find a better WiFi booster then this one. If your just trying to watch Netflix in a room that doesn‚Äôt have good WiFi coverage like me then it‚Äôs good. Was fairly easy to set up with my spectrum router and gives good coverage to the room I‚Äôm in, it makes you download a tether app to set it up and you can mess with the settings on the app too.

    Reset requires button to be held down longer than 1 second!

  Rena was very patient in dealing with me over a poor quality phone connection (not sure if it was my phone connection or TP-Link's.  Please note to your technicians and on your instruction sheets, the RE300 WiFi extender needs much more than 1 sec of holding the reset button down to cause the unit to actually reset (the LED's all turn on and go off).  This was the problem for me, after skipping the network selection step or my thinking that the app wanted the tp-link re300 wifi names, as the ""Quick Installation Guide"" said only 1 second was necessary to reset the unit.  The instructions for using the Tether APP and what the Tether APP actually does did not match reality.  The Tether app also did not seem to initially go to the page where a network can be selected.  The full reset of pushing the reset button down for several seconds, recycling the LED's, was key to allow me to continue with another setup try, which finally worked.

  This product works mostly as expected. However, the deal breaker for me was that there is apparently some sort of routing issue with the extended network. I could not get a host on the wired network to communicate with a client on the extended wireless network. For example a computer on the wired network could not ping a client that was connected to the extended network, even tho there was no problem with the client on the extended network reaching the internet.

  I received the AC1200  on June 6, 2020 and it was relatively easy to set up and it immedieately worked. However, after about one week it shut down and needed to be rebooted, which was accomplished by unplugging and repluging the device into a power outlet. There is a small ""lock"" button and a pin reset hole on the side, but we choose to reboot rather than reset the unit.  This corrected the problem, however, the AC1200 continued to periodically shut down over the next several weeks repeaingt this annoying cycle. It shut down will not reboot. I've done a hard reset and followed the installation instructions muiltiple times and get a no internet connection message each time. I submitted a request for help to TP Link's tech support over a month ago and no response. This TP Link product was a waste of money.

  I believe it is better than most cheap WIFI range extender/repeaters because my home has concrete walls which is challenging for wireless transmission.  I have used other cheap repeaters (dlink) and they had signal drops and less range.  The higher the ""AC"" number, the more promising the range and speed (of course, much higher price).  This price was good and it is working to connect my outdoor wireless WIFI security camera to the main WIFI router through the bedroom to the living room.  That is all it is for... and it is working well.

  Before I installed this I ran a speed test of my WiFi and the download was 142, the upload was 33, and the ping was 25. After I installed it it was 78/29/24, disappointing. So I waited a few minutes and tried again it was 68/34/25 I was starting to think that I might have to return it. I waited about 15 minutes and ran the speed test again AND it was a very disappointing 20/26/32!! ü§¨ now I was really beginning to get ready to return it. I decided to take periodic reads through out the day and decide after about 24 hours and if I couldn‚Äôt get anything more than what I was getting then I would return it at that point. So the next few readings were getting somewhat better. They were 82/29/25, 168/26/24, 100/28/21, 153/22/23. So I decided to keep it a while longer and test it some more over the next few days. It was up and down but it did boost my signal finally my download speeds went from the 160, to 199, to a whopping 373! that was the highest so far it is all over the place but I haven‚Äôt had any thing less than a 90 on my download speed. It was easy to set up so 5 stars for that but because of how disappointing it was after I installed it I‚Äôm only giving it 3 stars but I really would give it only 2.5 stars.

This is not too much of an issue for me at the moment because the devices I have connected don't need a lot of throughput.

    Great Extender - Tricky setup but well worth it.
  
",5.0 ,Jeremy Delgado,"Reviewed in the United States January 22, 2021","









  
  
    
  I really like my range extender. I did not fully understand the site compatibility when buying it and thought that it could do mesh with my tp-link ac4000. Even though it does not do that part it works crazy good. I live in a older house with lathe and plaster walls and even with the great coverage that the ac4000 provides in the room we have wifi is slow in other rooms. So the extender is just great and once set up is complete, which I found a little tricky - it just works perfectly after that.

  Before you try to set it up for the first time (especially if you have a TP-link router), get your network map (like  Archer C6) cranked up so you have a visual of the real-tie activity of what is connected. Plug the AC1200 extender (one mesh) into a receptacle close to your router.  After it boots up on its own and you have a single solid light, go back to your browser and type in the default address 192.168.0.254 to create a password. Hint: use the same password you use on your router so as you move around the house your device can seamlessly change from the wifi router to the one-mesh extension.  Then move the AC1200 One Mesh to an outlet closer (about half-way) to where you need the connection strength.  For  smart phone access, anywhere, install the tether app by scanning the code and download from AppStore or Google Play and select the AC1200 -- EASY!

  I had very high hopes for the TP-Link AC1200 WiFi Extender (RE300) but have been extremely disappointed and if I can find the box it came in I will be returning it. My home Wifi is Frontier FIOS and our house is a bit more than 2000 sqft. There are 3 different ways to install the RE300 and I've found getting one of them to work is totally blind luck particularly for 5G. After many tries to install including rebooting the unit, resetting to factory, trying the Tether app, WPS and Web installation I have managed to get it working. But, and this is the most frustrating part, in a location which Tether says is a good one, it keeps dropping off line, sometimes coming back online on its own and sometimes requiring me to go through the whole frustrating setup process again. And support was no help telling me to try the different methods and if that doesn't work exchange the unit as a bad one. Real bummer.

  Super easy to install.  The only reason I gave this 4 stars vs 5 is because this extender has its own wifi network, so if you need to access a stronger signal via the extender, you have to manually go into your phone/laptop and switch to the extender's wifi network.  It basically gives you a second wifi network.

  I live in the basement of my house so I was looking for an extender to reach down to my room a little better. First off, this extender would not connect to the 5ghz band of my router, no problem I thought. After about a week of using it, my bandwidth started to plummet. I pay for ~200 MBs on my internet plan and I don't have a single speed test on this extender above 10. This is completely unacceptable, especially for the price I paid for the product. I would not recommend buying this product and wish I could get a refund at this point.

    Completely unreliable - looses 5 GHz signal in 12 hours or less
  
",2.0 ,Leonard,"Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  This WiFi extender has some positive features - relatively strong WiFi signals for 2.4 and 5 GHz networks. It's easy to configure and web based user interface is easy to use, although it doesn't have many of the monitoring and troubleshooting features needed to figure out problems in the network. However, these pluses are completely negated by the negatives - this extended software is junk. It cannot reliably maintain WiFi connections to the router even for 24 hours. With moderate use, the extender looses 5 GHz network first and then 2.4 GHz network in 12 hours. Even for a household device this is unacceptable. It's OK if a cheap household extender has to be rebooted a couple of times a week, but doing it a couple of times a day is too much.Cannot recommend this device for any service, even for light duty.

  Setup is a bit confusing. When setup tells you that you can rename the wifi name for this device DON'T.

    Difficult to install
  
",1.0 ,Edna M.,"Reviewed in the United States April 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  I tried all three suggested installation methods. This is the problem that I'm having: I use both 2.4 and 5GHz in the house, dual band. I want to extend the 2.4GHz because this signal is weak. The One-Mesh kept loading both, so it tripped my security cameras that run only on 2.4GHz since the One-Mesh uses the strongest wi-fi signal. I tried going the router connection where I was able to kill the switch for the 5GHz but the ""client"" became my android phone and did nothing to amplify the 2.4 GHZ Wi-Fi connection to my cameras. My Wi-fi uses one password for both the 2.4 and 5 GHz so it kept using the 5GHz signal even when I picked another host and didn't enter the password. It may be an easy fix but you cannot get a customer service rep to help not even on chat. Other companies have reps working remote from home to provide service, but this one doesn't. I'm not rating this product and I will give it a few more days to see if someone answers the phone to provide help, otherwise I'm sending both back for a refund.

  I wanted to use this extender for a 300Mbps plan and I am very disappointed with its speed. While I get a reliable > 300Mbps speed from my Xfinity router, this extender only gives me around 20-50Mbps in close distance, otherwise even less. This is even the case when I place the extender very close to the Xfinity router. Activating the ""High Speed Mode"" in the app decreases the speed even further. I don't recommend this extender for anyone with a fast internet connection, the speed is not as advertised.

  We have been using network extenders for years (old house, conrete walls,...), but the ones we used did not have the feature to set up time restrictions (for the kids). So I purchased this item to replace a NETGEAR extender that had eventually broken after 3-4 years (a more reasonable lifetime for a tech device under $100). Initially it worked well, and other than some reviewers, I had no problem setting up the device. After 3-4 weeks, suddenly no internet connection. Reset it a few times, worked for an hour or two, then again no internet connection. Now it won't even work after resetting it.After I read the experiences other reviewers had with tech support, I won't even bother.

  The one major advantage this device has is how easy it is to connect to the main router. Unfortunately, I can‚Äôt really say any other good things about this extender. It advertises speeds up to 1200Mbps, which is only true in the sense that you‚Äôll never come close to exceeding 1200Mbps.My main router is gigabit-capable and I receive gigabit speeds from my ISP - typically around 700-800Mbps on wifi. My extender is located where there is excellent coverage, and this is also indicated on the extender itself. I tested this extender while standing 1 foot away. I received the following results from speed tests consistently over several days:5G: ~100-120Mbps2.4G: ~20MbpsThese results, combined with the weak range of the extender‚Äôs signal, make this product nearly useless. In the exact same spot, I still get 600Mbps from my main router. I can only imagine this product being helpful if you have one room that is just barely outside your main router‚Äôs range, and even then you‚Äôre going to get shoddy internet.I did not buy this extender expecting perfection at all, and it still disappointed. 2 stars literally only because of how easy setup was.Update: My initial review is just an example of how degraded the signal is coming from the extender.  In terms of actual usage, my router is on the first floor and the extender is in a room on the second floor with excellent coverage.  The third floor room directly above the extender is where I would like improved coverage.  The extender is in the closest possible location to the third floor room.  I am not getting improved coverage at all via the extender.

",4.0 ,Colin Gore,"Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  This helped extend wifi seamlessly to our back yard.  The AC1750 router alone didn't come close, but by adding this extender to a spot with good signal/line of site to the router about 50 feet away, we're getting 75 Mbps instead of 3... or more often zero... without it.  The great advantage of OneMesh devices is you don't need to create a 2nd network (like TPLINK1234-ext) that requires devices to switch between networks and breaks some smarthome functionality.  That's what I had to do on our old repeater. My only issue is that it costs nearly as much as a 2nd router, but perhaps that's what you need to pay to put out enough signal strength.

  I'd purchased another brand of extender that I couldn't get to connect to my older router.  Using the phone app method supplied by TP-Link, the extender was connection in short order (and I'm not an IT whiz).  It has dramatically improved my ability to stay connected to my office's VPN while working from home, and it even breathed life into my old desktop (on an upper floor of my home) that has never had a strong/fast wifi connection.  I would highly recommend this extender - especially if you have an older home with plaster walls, and older router, etc.

  As the other reviews said, this is really quite easy to set up. But when you open the package it says to place the router a max of 16 feet from your existing router, and if the dead area in your house is upstairs or downstairs from your main router and you can't move that router, this extender doesn't provide much of an improvement. I've kept it because I think our service in our downstairs basement is marginally better, and for the price it's probably worth avoiding the hassle of sending it back. But the reasons why lots of houses have deadspots seem like they're not addressable by a wifi extender of any sort, and the product page doesn't give you a great idea of the requirements for optimal usage.

",5.0 ,Steven Greene,"Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  This has been a great mesh extender for my Archer A7 router.  At first, it was confusing because it was working as a regular extender (separate network) rather than a mesh extender.  Fortunately, I saw in other reviews here that you needed to update router firmware first.  But that should be *clearly stated* in the installation guide.  It's not.  That's a big fail.Once, I did update firmware, it was easy to get the mesh network and it works great.  If all you want is an extender, you should probably buy something else as there's a lot cheaper extenders out there with good reviews, but this was a great way to get a mesh network with an existing TP-Link router.

  Installed this wifi extender. It said the signal was good and placement was good. Connected to me 2.4g and 5g modem. Now every device I use in my house is so slow. Areas where I had no problem now take forever to use or can't connect at all. A total waste on my money. Would not recommend this product to anyone.

  TP-Link AC1200 WiFi Extender (RE300) was super easy to install.  The signal was ok at the far end of my house, but what happened was it was slower.  I originally bought the TP-Link AC1200 WiFi Extender (RE300) to improve my upload speed, which it did not help with.  This was not the item to boost uploads.  I ended up taking this to my rental house and it did improve the signal strength through the house there.  That house is situated on the lower part of a hill and the router is in the garage.  The booster improved the signal so that we can get reception upstairs on the opposite side of the house from where the router sits.

  I purchased this RE300 range extender to work with my TP-Link AC1750 router. My router is located on the main level of the house and I wanted better wifi in the basement. Setup went pretty well and things appeared to be working ‚Äì signal better in the basement and same upstairs. Unfortunately, things were not stable upstairs. Occasionally, the upstairs signal (speed) went down and stayed down. The only way to get the speed back was unplug the RE300 and then plug it back in after a few minutes. This was annoying at best. I then turned down the power on the RE300 for less coverage, and this seemed to help with speed stability upstairs. I thought things were working o.k. until I carried my laptop downstairs and things really got squirrelly. LAN speed really dropped off on the laptop. I rebooted the laptop while downstairs and speed returned but all my networked devices disappeared. Again, I had to unplug the RE300 and reboot. It appears to me this thing is anything but seamless. I guess it ‚Äúworks‚Äù if all of your wifi components don‚Äôt move and you get the power adjusted so there is little overlap in coverage. I noticed in one review that the company suggested setting up two different networks and manually connecting depending on what part of the house you‚Äôre in. This sounds like the problem I had, and certainly doesn‚Äôt describe a ‚Äúmesh system.‚Äù The deadline for returning the thing has passed so I‚Äôm SOL. I certainly couldn‚Äôt get it to work like a mesh system.

  I recently upgraded the router in a vacation house to an Archer C7 and figured I probably would need a range extender due to the layout and location of the router so I got this range extender as well (modest ~1800 sq ft house, the internet line from the telephone company is at one end of the house near the main road in the utility room, but we spend a lot of time on the other end of the house in the office or out on the back patio which is directly off of the office). With our previous setup, we had another brand of range extender that did an ""ok"" job of getting the signal across the house but it was obvious that we were suffering a loss in speed and it would also drop out at the worst moments and was very difficult to get setup and working. This all changed with the new router and range extender! The setup with the router was extremely easy and worked the first time around, no having to reset and try again. So far it has been amazing, I would highly recommend this range extender!!!!

  Super easy install. I have Fios modem, used the WPS button to sync the modem and extender together. Took all off 5 mins to sync 2.5 and 5. Did the sync right next to my modem. Once completed I took the modem down to my basement where I have weak signal. Plugged the extender in the outlet next to the smart tv to see if the signal was good there. All lights light up indicating good signal. Changed the connection settings on the tv to use the EXT signal (which showed as ‚Äúexcellent‚Äù signal compared to my ‚Äúfair‚Äù FIOS modem signal). TV has been working great since then with no buffering issues

  I needed a good extender to help boost the wifi signal to/from a number of wifi cams around our home. I tried a few, but never quite got the signal strength needed to support a couple of the cams. I've used TP-Link products in the past and have great success with them, no complaints, so I thought I'd give this extender a try.First, set-up was easy and straightforward. We have a dual-band router and I was able to link both bands on the first try for each.Second, I wanted to rename the extender's SSID's for these bands, that the Tether app from TP-Link made that pretty easy, too.Third, I measured the signal strength at the cam that had the worst reception from our router. The strength with the router alone was -60db. Now, with the extender, it's improved to -49 db. I'm quite happy with the improvement.I highly recommend this extender.

    Instructions are not great
  
",2.0 ,W. Andrew Tudhope,"Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  I like TPLink products, however... The instructions make some bad assumptions.  I am an IT professional, therefore I do not use default IP addresses for my home network.  As a result, without readdressing my network, the options provided in the instructions will not allow this product to connect.  For example, they suggest to download the iPhone app and run the app by connecting to the TPLink extender network. Fine, however, the app requires a user registration. Well, that requires a network connection which doesn't exist because I can't configure the device on my network. Ok, next... Connect to an IP address (192.168.0.254). That doesn't work because I don't use the default 192.168.0.xxx addresses. Press the WPS button on my router... Nope, I have a more advanced router without a WPS button.  Network security is important, therefore think outside of the box...  It will be a pain in the neck, but I will do the donkey dance to reconfigure my network to address the shortcomings on this product. Annoying...

  So, we have Verizon Gigabit Fios service in a Townhouse.  Router is on 2nd floor dead center of house and utilizes both 2.4 and 5.0.  3rd floor bedrooms struggle with WiFi so I bought this to put on 3rd floor landing.Setup out of box was really simple and straightforward.  No tech support needed so I can‚Äôt rate that.  Connection signal is strong and connecting from Apple devices is quick and easy.My issue is that as you can see from the attached screenshots (taken while connected to 5.0) is that the best speed was achieved using the router, which I am further away from.  I actually decreased speed by going through this extender.  I‚Äôm not sure why since the signal strengths should be stronger 3 feet from extender than the 30 or so ft from router through the walls and floor.Run speed test on your existing setup first, in your problematic area, and see what you‚Äôre really working with.  For my situation, the extender is actually performing worse.Buy if you are able to return so you can see for yourself.  WiFi has many variables that impact results so it isnt necessarily fair for my results to mean you‚Äôll definitely have the same results.Best of luck!

  I've become a fan of TP-Link in recent months. I install internet for a living right now and I've been looking for a simpler solution to recommend folks. You can go blow huge money on mediocre mesh systems like the Orbi which will set you back $500 for a 3-pack these days, or you can buy a TP-Link router and buy a couple of these extenders and create a smooth mesh system that's low-profile and can get you up to 3,000-4,000 sq ft of coverage without breaking a sweat or spending all afternoon getting it squared away. If you download the Tether App from TP-Link, it's easy to get these extenders setup. Right now I'm not connected to a TP-Link router but eventually I'll probably replace my modem/router combo from my ISP with a TP-Link A7 or whatever their AX/WIFI-6 setup is because I like the idea of a mesh network but I don't like the restrictive nature of some of the ones out there. All that being said, this extender seems to get the job done. I still get hiccups and packet loss but I'm starting to think it has everything to do with my ISP's modem/router unit or my ISP specifically and less-so the equipment in my home. I have a 3 level home (2 main floors and a bonus room/attic at the top) and want quality wireless connections on every floor. I sat this extender on the 2nd floor and game and use my PC on the 3rd floor. I initially used the 5G band for the better speed but as I sorted through the settings on TP-Link's Tether app, I found that there's a ""high speed mode"" available. What I quickly found is that you can choose 1 of 2 things here: use the 2.4 GHz WIFI band from your internet source broadcast as a dedicated communication channel or a 5 GHz WIFI band dedicated to communicating with your internet source broadcast and then use the other band to connect your devices to. What that does (I happen to be familiar with this process - there's no real instructions) is create a finite connection over one band and throttle-up the other band for your devices to connect to. I used the 5 GHz band to create the modem/router > extender pairing for maximum performance between those two devices (they aren't that far away from each other so the 5 GHz band is fairly strong where the extender is) then I use the 2.4 GHz band to connect my Xbox One X and my PC. The results are fantastic for the price I paid for the extender. I ran a speed test on my Xbox One X and got 105 Mbps down, 10 Mbps up, 100% wireless connection strength, 0% packet loss, and 24 ms ping. That's solid performance given that my maximum download speed is 150 Mbps if the network is completely free of other users.You may or may not need to use the ""high speed"" setting and dedicate bands like I did, but I wanted my connection to be as solid as I could make it so I used the faster band to connect my extender to the internet and the ""slower"" band (2.4 GHz is slower most of the time) to establish high quality connections with my devices so I can move around more. I'm very pleased so-far. If anything changes I'll report back but I spent a couple hours testing out online gaming with my Xbox and it seems to work pretty well. A couple hiccups at first but the experience smoothed out quite a bit as time went on.

  I have this extender paired with my TP-Link AC1200 (A6) router (with the latest firmware updates). This does a great job boosting the signals (primarily the 5 GHz band) in the family room a floor below the router location.Setup was super simple... I just used the WPS buttons to pair, and it worked like a champ. The downstairs TV doesn't miss a streaming beat connected to the 5 GHz. I setup the mesh so the phones are also happy wandering throughout the house. And the Tether app is nice for keeping tabs on everything if you need to know more than just looking at the status lights to see that it is connected.All in all a nice inexpensive solution for boosting wifi signals, and getting to play with a simple mesh. I'd recommend this extender in a heartbeat.

  I've been using this thing for a couple months now mainly for my laptop here at home. Our wireless router is downstairs. I have this extender plugged in halfway between the router and our bedroom, where I do most of my work. When it connects, the signal is full strength and seems fast. But after being connected for a little while, it drops internet connection - the wifi signal remains very strong, but there is no internet connection. This happens several times per day, every single day. I've never been able to use the connection for a full day without it dropping the internet connection at least 2-3 times. I end up having to change back to the main wireless connection to get internet. This was happening to my daughters as they work through their school Zoom meetings on their Chromebooks too. I had to remove the extender connection for them and put them back on the main wifi so it would be more reliable for them.I researched and tried several things to try and fix it, but no luck. So just be aware, this product will certainly make your wifi signal very strong, but that doesn't necessarily mean you will be able to access the internet with it all the time. It's EXTREMELY frustrating. Just beware.

  I got this along with the TP-Link AC1750 (Archer A7) router which they recommend pairing with this device in order to create a seamless mesh network.  This was the specific reason I chose this product over many others.  I was ordering this for my Uncle and wanted it to be the simplest possible solution for him, where he'd have just one network name no matter where he connected.The instructions that accompany the extender indicate that if you're connecting it to one of their compatible routers that has the Mesh capability that it should pick up the information from the main router and create a single network name automatically...  this was not the case.I did manage to get it set up that way, but it was nowhere near easy or automatic.  And, to make matters worse, the instructions don't explain how to do it either.  First, I had to update the router's firmware before the Mesh option was even available as a choice (are you kidding???)  Why would this be when it's being marketed as having this capability.  After the update, I then had to go into the router's settings and ENABLE the mesh networking option (it was off by default).  Another big 'why?'.  This was all after a number of unsuccessful attempts to set up the range extender using WPS and it kept creating the SSIDs with '_EXT'.  So, I figured I'm good now, and reset the range extender and tried again, now with Mesh enabled... should work this time...  NOPE!  Found out that I now have to go into the range extender's setup and [guess what?] ENABLE the mesh option there as well!  And finally, it now works [as I expected it to right out of the box.]After all of the above, I now have a seamless network through the house and I then took this to my uncle's house where he had terrible wi-fi in part of his house due to the layout.  I set this up (already programmed) and everything works beautifully!  Fast enough speeds and solid signal everywhere, especially in his living room which is very far away from the main router (we put the extender about half way between).It works so well that I have ordered a second pair of these (both router and extender) to use in my own home where we have problems with our Ring doorbells getting a good signal from our main router.  I'm hoping that this setup will help here for that purpose, as it will allow me to place the extender very close to the doorbells and still be close enough to the main router to get a strong enough signal (they just need an extra boost I think to get through the exterior wall.)  I'll update this review with info on how well that works once I get it installed.In general, the router and extender both have an easy to use interface for the settings and seem to have most options that one would need for basic networking (they meet our needs.)  Price is reasonable and performance has been good thus far.In conclusion, I would recommend this product for its features and performance, but would not recommend it to anyone who doesn't have experience in manually configuring these types of devices, as the setup is not easy or straightforward as claimed in the description and instructions.  I personally gave it 4 stars based on my personal experience with it and the fact that I was able to get it working.  Obviously, if I was unable to get it to this point it would have been 1 star, so this is something the customer (and the company) should consider.  Also, I could not find any tech support number to call for help with this; only links to websites, which also did not yield any contact information where I could get help when I needed it.

  My neighbor is gracious enough to share her wifi but i don't get a great signal throughout my place.. This was the perfect fix and Super easy to install. Almost plug and play. I downloaded the tether app and connected the network to the extender then logged on to the new network and now have full signal through my place on every device I have on the network üëç all you need is the password to the desired network OR access to the router and you're in

    This is half duplex - Buy if you want half the speed of your main router

  I bought this extender and installed it and everything was breeze so far. When i tested the download and upload speeds ( with extender pretty much next to the router), the speeds were half of the main WiFi. I called the support and we tried few things such as resetting the extender, ensuring the firmware is up to date etc and eventually the support person asked me to send screenshot of the speed differences between main router and extender to send to their engineering team. After couple of days, i heard from them for a troubleshooting session and when i send few timeslots. The next dayi heard that the half the speed from extender is expected since it is half duplex extender and whether i still wanted a troubleshooting session.I was not expecting increase in speed, but i was disappointed that their product description did not say anything about half duplex and reduction in download/upload speed by half. Hopefully, TP Link is more transparent about reduction in speed.  I am returning it shortly.

  This is a little cross band repeater, kind of like your kids. Hears it one place, repeats it in another in a higher pitched squeeky voice. Used this to extend the range of my beloved Apple Airport to the far reaches of the house to talk to a Ring camera and let my kids cell phone connect to the network. It knocks off some speed and adds ping time but overall does the job. Pretty impressive if you ever built a cross band repeater its big and expensive and this is a little mini cheap version that does the same thing. No free goods, no compensation to write this. I just love RF and things that work with RF.

  This is a nice package, easy to install and produces a strong WiFi signal. It worked well for one day then while the WiFi connection remained strong the internet connection was lost. I reset the unit with the same experience. I haven‚Äôt had time to debug it (but I shouldn‚Äôt have too) and I‚Äôm way past the deadline for returns so I guess I either play around and get it to work or buy another vendor‚Äôs product and use this one as a paperweight or doorstop.

  The photos are before and after I got this extender. I was using a linksys 6400 extender that died within 9 months of use. I got this about an hour ago, set it up in 5 minutes using the app, and have already gotten 5x the internet speed I had before and without this extender. I can‚Äôt speak to how long this will last but considering a $100 extender lasted me 9 months and this is half the price, I would be happy if this even lasts a year! I work from home and my room is the only room in the house where the internet just drops. This has been a really great purchase.For the reviews saying setup is difficult I can only assume some people don‚Äôt have smartphones to set this up with or have no wps button on their router because this was insanely easy for me to set up.Also for the reviews saying this thing is garbage I can honestly say the issue STARTS with your internet. If you don‚Äôt have good internet to start with then this won‚Äôt magically fix that issue. I also don‚Äôt think these people took the extra minute to move the extender around to see what spot it works best in (yes that matters).5 stars, thank you!!

    Small single level home - didn't work a bit

  I have a small single level 2000 square foot home, the wifi router is in one corner of the house - I have 4 wifi cameras around the house on each corner of the house.  The two farthest away from the router were connected but had low signal strength so I purchased this extender to give them more signal strength.  I followed the instructions to set up the extender and they were fairly simple and easy to use.  I proceeded to connect the cameras to the new extender, but the extender did NOT improve the signal strength to the camera's,  and in fact the signal strength from the extender was WORSE than allowing the cameras to just connect straight to my wifi router.  I allowed a few days to see if the signal strength would improve as suggested in a suggestion I read, HOWEVER, after 3 days - the extender ceased to provide signal to the 2 cameras altogether, and my security system was compromised by those 2 cameras being offline for a day, until I could get home and assess the problem.  I had to completely restart the extender in order to get the extender to begin sending a signal to my cameras again.  This is a complete waste of time.  I have never purchased such a product that actually makes things worse for the problem it was supposed to fix.
