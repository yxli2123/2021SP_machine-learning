    Incredible value - coming from a tool snob
  
",5.0,Nicholas Bryan,"Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2018","









  
  
    
  So the ‚Äú1 click‚Äù button finally bit me. This came to my doorstep and I had NO idea where it came from. My roommate had been asking about a super basic tool kit to be had cheaply. I guess I ordered it while scrolling. I have 6 full size tool chests (yes, standing ones) full and literally top of the top of the line tools. Yet I didn‚Äôt send this one back. Here‚Äôs why -I use a lot of tools. More even than most professionals. I‚Äôm a general contractor at work, and a woodworker and gunsmith and all around tinkerer at home.Why do I recommend this set to anyone who won‚Äôt desperately miss $20? Because these tools are just under the par of the basic/ok big box store regular tools. I‚Äôve probably received 10-20 tool kits with cheap-from-China true junk. Like the kind that a lot of times won‚Äôt even get you by in a pinch. This is not that. I would describe these as a perfect homeowners kit. The steel in these tools is impressively hard, particularly in the bit set. I broke, damaged, or generally rendered unusable 6 screwdrivers in the month of April. The bit set included with this is higher quality and harder than any no-name brand you‚Äôll find. The Allen wrenches are slightly less hard than most of my others, but by design, Allen keys aren‚Äôt going to take on too much damage.For a homeowner that sticks to putting together furniture, hanging things, maybe a little appliance work, etc, you can‚Äôt go wrong here. If you know what you‚Äôre doing you could even do a bit of light duty mechanic work. Add a drill and a saw and you‚Äôve got some incredible versatility here.This kit is set up to cover as many bases as possible in as little pieces as possible. For instance, instead of including a metric and SAE set of sockets, they include the odd SAE size that would be the metric. I wish a lot of my more expensive tools would do this (in some cases). Same with the Allen keys. They don‚Äôt include a 6mm Allen key. A common size. 1/4‚Äù is typically too big, but they do include a 6mm hex bit which would take its place.If you can only have one tool or tool set for twenty bucks, make this one it - you won‚Äôt be sorry.

  Not high end but why would you expect it for the price? I've spent years around high end tools and when I moved, I couldn't bring my stocked tool chest with me. I needed something to have handy for when small projects popped up and this set does the job. Yeah, eventually I'll upgrade or send my tools across the country but for now, this set suffices. Perfect for the weekend warrior. I've used it to hang my flat screen and to tear apart my PS3 to clean it out. A set that doesn't advertise for more than it really is and for that I can respect it.

  I was looking for a mini tool set to use around the house for a few renovation projects. I looked in the store and online. I came across Cartman 148- piece tool set. I usually use craftsman and I didn't want to waste any money. After researching this, I decided to purchase this tool set. I am glad I bought it. The case is small and can be stored anywhere securely. No worries about anything falling out. It has a basic tool just for about anything you need depending on the work that you are completing. I have used it to tighten up screws, hang boards on the wall, and take apart/assemble a faucet. So far so good. I like it. I did not have to spend much on this. It was at a great price. I would recommend this if you are looking for tool kit to get you started or just to have around.

I even had to come back on here to double check it wasn‚Äôt an error on my part and those items weren‚Äôt included. But no they shipped me a tool box with missing tools lol I couldn‚Äôt believe it my first tool box was a fool box lol long story Short I Sent it back Im still waiting for my refund & I still have no tools.

  Gave this to my daughter and her boyfriend as a house closing gift. It‚Äôs their first place and, as I told them, it‚Äôs handy to have a good set of tools for all those little things that come up as a homeowner. It would take time and money to piecemeal together the tools in this set. I know how many times I had to run out to buy a tool to fix a single problem!This is a nice sturdy set in a great compact storage case. They should be able to grab the case and find the tool they need to fix most any minor household problem. Having so many tools in one case will reduce the number of times you grab a single tool out of box thinking it‚Äôs what you need to fix something only to find out you need another tool or an additional tool! (Can you tell that I‚Äôve suffered my frustrations doing this more than a few times? üòâ)The tools seems durable and comfortable to use (we just pulled things out and played around with a bit). Over time, they may need to supplement this with heavier duty tools for a project but this should serve them well for years to come.I looked at a few sets online and in local stores but for the sheer number and variety of tools in this set, and the price, this was by far, the best value!Highly recommend this set for your basic household needs. The kids were really pleased to get this. It seems silly but most people get new/first-time homeowners pretty things (and I will when they finish renovations and move in) but this is a great gift that anyone would be grateful to have when some random thing needs fixing!

  These aren't super high quality, but they aren't intended to be. They are inexpensive and will get the standard household jobs done. A good assortment, especially for those of us that tend to misplace screwdrivers and pliers all the time. They are surprisingly strong, but obviously not premium quality. A great set for most people.

",4.0,Ida Jean Anderson,"Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2018","









  
  
    
  This ""kitchen"" tool box works for me, however, I wish it included a small level. I was comparing tools with a level and this Cartman with a box cutter. I went for the box cutter and hoped I could ""eye-ball"" the picture hanging. The box the tools are in could use some upgrades and a little better design but it stands between my refrig and wall quite nicely. The tools themselves are quality as Cartman always is.

  I got the Cartman 148-Piece Tool Set as a housewarming/starter set for someone moving away from home for the first time.  The tools are ok, for the most part.  I think a single, adjustable wrench, and a ratcheting screwdriver handle (instead of the solid one).  The tape measure is a bit of a toy, but works in a pinch.  The tools that will probably be used the most (screwdrivers, hammer, and pliers) have comfortable grips.  The case is decent, with no worry that the closures will fall off anytime soon.  A really nice touch is that there's box of screws, nails, and wall anchors.  Recommended

",4.0,Alex R.,"Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2019","









  
  
    
  I needed a set of tools for minor projects here and there in my college dorm.  This toolset works perfectly for that.  If you wanted a collection of tools for more serious projects, or for bigger handyman jobs, then you definitely will want something a little more expensive.Not that this is a big deal, but a little bit of the finish (and I think the metal too) has worn off from both the screwdrivers after using them several times.  They still work fine, but I wonder if the ends will become stripped eventually.Anyway, fantastic value.  Highly recommended if you need some tools for some minor projects here and there.

  So this is a mixed review. The set seems pretty well made for the price and is well stocked. I shipped it into my daughters new house in college. We were flying and I did not being tools. In two days I had to build a bed, a chair and a desk. My main tool was the screwdriver. It has a dimpled handle no doubt for grip. However the hard plastic of the dimples really ate up my hands.  This is a great set for a quick job and to have laying around. I would look further for my next kid to make sure the handles were easier on the hands.

  I recently lost my shop in an Oregon wildfire.  I had spent the last 30+ years accumulating tools and finally got to a point in life where I had the right tool for the job at hand.  Not anymore!Because of all the clean up and repair I needed to do on my property I needed a complete set of tools quickly. I chose the Cartman 205 piece toolset.  For the money the quality is pretty decent and the selection of tools is exactly what I was looking for.My only gripe at this point is the 1/2‚Äù socket driver doesn‚Äôt have an adapter to use the smaller sockets. I had to run some 3/8‚Äù lag bolts and the larger handle on the 1/2‚Äô‚Äù driver would have given me more leverage. Also the bit drivers break pretty easy under a work load. I‚Äôve lost two philips bits already from driving screws.

  I regret waiting past the return window to send this back because it was a waste of money.  All the tools feel really cheap but my biggest disappointment is that nothing will stay in it's place.  The tools are supposed to ""pop"" into place and stay but every time I open it back up stuff is everywhere, and yes I have gone through a couple times and made sure they were properly positioned before closing it.I have offered other people a couple tools to use (tape measure, some screws and a screwdriver) and everyone commented after that next time they'd rather use ""real"" tools.The nails and screws that came with it are so tiny as to be useless, the thumbtacks are more helpful.

",1.0,Albert M.,"Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  After having tried to use this se5 a few times, it's my opinion that it's the most useless set I have ever owned. One of the socket wrench heads is jammed onto the adapter for the socket handle (there is no rachet for the sockets) and cannot be removed, rendering all of the other sockets totally useless with the set. The most used tool around the house is not included in the kit --STANDARD PLIERS. Kit contains needle nosed pliers, but no standard pliers. The handles on the smaller allen wrenches bend when being used.

    Good value, but not particularly great tools
  
",4.0,Althernai,"Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2021","









  
  
    
  I bought this for a few tasks in a house I just moved to. It's pretty good for $30 and served its purpose, but some of the tools are definitely better than others. The screwdrivers have a decent selection of bits and are fine. The tape measure is also exactly what you'd expect and probably so are the wrenches and hex keys (haven't used them, but they look fine).On the other hand, the pliers are neither here nor there: they're tiny and look like you'd use them them for electrical work, but they don't have the holes typically used for wire-stripping and they're not actually that sharp. I tried to strip a bit of the covering off of a wire and couldn't do it without losing a few strands of copper. The hammer is similarly small and lightweight -- it worked for installing some curtain rods, but requires both more force and more precision than a traditional hammer.Finally, the case itself is compact and easy to carry, but very hard to open (it's almost painful to move the latches when not wearing gloves). Also, the tools don't always stay secured in their places and since they're on both the top and the bottom of the case, there's always the chance of something falling out no matter how you open it.In summary, better versions of some tools will probably have to be bought separately, but this is still good value for the money.

  I bought this for our daughter in her new apartment. She loves tools, which has made her a success as an OR nurse, but had always used her Dad's tools. Now that she has an apartment of her own and is putting things together, I bought her this tool box as a birthday present.  It was fun to see her examine each tool in the box carefully and figure out how each one worked before she dug into her birthday cake.  The selection of tools is quite complete for the occasional handy woman's usage., and is all packed together ingeniously. I recommend this tool set for everyday chores around the house.

  I needed a bunch of tools to put my bike together and this tool box mostly delivered.

Unfortunately my bike needed metric keys, and since it doesn't say anywhere that these are SAE....here you go.

I haven't gotten around to using every tool included, simply because the need has not arisen yet.I have used the hammer and it felt very sturdy and did its job.I have used the boxcutter as well and as far as I can tell, it is quite sharp (cut through leather of sofa like it was a piece of cake).I think this is something everyone will find useful at some point, and if it won't hurt your wallet, then it's probably a good idea to get it.

  I was looking for an all-in-one kit for basic home maintenance and repair and this was such a great deal. I haven't used it yet, but the tools look well-constructed. I'd give it 5 stars, but the hammer isn't quite as heavy duty as the rest of the tools in the kit. But for $20, I'm a super happy fix-it gal.

  I just began living alone and needed a basic tool set for random tasks that may arise. This set is a great value for the price. The tools are sturdy and almost everything you'd need is here. My only gripe is there was no level included. I know it's just one item, and I don't mean to be a downer, but why include screws and fasteners and not a level? As long as you understand that's missing and you're okay with that, I highly recommend this product, I just can't justify 5 stars.

",1.0,Alex,"Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2018","









  
  
    
  I bought this kit to leave at an apartment I am renovating. The first tool I used was the tape measure, which did the job for three windows before the hook snapped off, causing the ruler to retract into the holder. I took apart the tape measure for what should have been a quick fix, but the springs seemed cheaply made and the whole thing was quickly unsalvageable. Hope the rest of the tools turn out alright, but the tape measure self-destructing within 5 minutes does not bode well.

  Living in a one bedroom apartment there is not much use for the toolkit but for small repairs and this works perfectly!! All the furniture I bought for my apartment needed to be assembled and this kit came in handy and had every tool I needed plus more!! The reason I gave 4 out of 5 stars was because the hammer looks like the top part is just glued on and you can see lots of glue residue. However it still works for what I needed it for, so definitely a great buy!

  The wire cutter/stripper is garbage. The edges that are supposed to be sharp are dull, and the sides don't even meet. So it's not even usable. However, everything else is good. Just get a wiring/solder kit separately, and you'll be covered.
