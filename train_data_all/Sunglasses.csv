  Great sunglasses for the price. I've paid more for ones that broke the next day. These are great and vision during the day is great. I don't wear my sunglasses at night like a creeper or a tool so I can't comment on the visibility during those times. Great buy and quality product.

    Confusing Description but Decent Glasses for the Money
  
",4.0,The Virginian,"Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2019","









  
  
    
  So there are many possible combinations here.  I bought the ""(2 Pack) Matte Black Frame Black Lens / Matte Black Frame Black Lens.""  One pair is a Wayfarer clone; the other is a Clubmaster clone.But the lenses are not Black (thankfully - because if they were black they wouldn't transmit any light)  Indeed, the description shows six possible colors:  Grey, G15, Blue, Green, Red and Silver.  No Black.  And no Brown either, although some of the combinations say that the lenses are Brown.  Contradictory and very confusing!The lenses I got were more like bluish grey.  Very nice visibility.  They are plastic, just like the frames.  Despite the high ratings here, don't confuse these glasses for Maui Jim's.  The high ratings for these glasses can only be driven by the low prices.  And it is for that reason I gave them 4 stars.  They are a step up from the glasses you find in any tourist shop in a beach town, and actually for a lower price.  So that's nice.I tested out these two pair of KALIYADIs glasses, and a pair of the Polarspex Wayfarer clones I also bought here, on a drive cross country and back.Of the two pair of KALIYADIs that I got, I'm not a fan of the look or feel of the Wayfarer clone.  I like the look and feel of the Polarspex Wayfarer clones, although I like the visibility of these KALIYADIs better.However, I like the KALIYADIs Clubmaster clone a lot.  Very light and comfortable, and they look good.  An excellent value.Overall, between these KALIYADIs and the Polarspex, which are both highly rated at Amazon, I liked the KALIYADIs better.  For $16 for two pair, it's hard to go wrong.

",2.0,The Deal Doctor ,"Reviewed in the United States November 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I know I cannot expect much when purchasing sunglasses for such a low price, but I do expect -- at the very least-- for them to last more than a few uses. Unfortunately, all three broke within a month or so of use. This would be understandable if I was rough with them or careless, but I literally kept them in my Ray-Ban's case for safekeeping. So, if you want some low-cost throwaway sunglasses that will not last, these may work well! Otherwise, avoid this buy.

  After wearing these almost everyday since ordering, I love everything about them. The only con is they are a little  tight on my temples. Recently my wife‚Äôs $200.00 Raybans broke, she couldn‚Äôt  find any thing she liked at the Hut so they gave us 50% off on another pair (they really suck you in) SOOOOO. I ended up walking out with a brand new pair of RayBan Justins ( I‚Äôve been looking at getting a pair for a while but didn‚Äôt need or want to spend RB$ ). The difference between the RB and these on Amazon as far as comfort is night and day (THE RB JUSTIN IS MUCH COMFIER FOR ME)!  The finished product over all tho the differences are MARGINAL AT BEST!  I asked myself are these RB really worth $168.00 vs $12.00 for two pair on Amazon? Absolutely not!!! The RB are better don‚Äôt get me wrong, but not $156.00 dollars better. I also paid $600.00 for a pair of Ditas tho so take my advice with a grain of salt lol!

  The side corners of the sunglasses constantly reflect what's behind you, so wearing these shades would tire you out after a while. A bit distracting, to say the least. The nose pads are also a bit too noticeable to the wearer (feels like the nose is being pinched by a baby plastic lobster, if that makes any sense).

There's not a time when it happens when it is anything but a plus. If the instance occurs, it is surely, unequivocally and unmistakably, a plus. Without exception, I would consider it a plus if and when they do not look weird on my head, and these sunglasses do not look weird on my head.

  I debated writing this but decided to spare someone else from this experience.I originally bought a 2 pack and loved them for the first week. These sunglasses are stylish, lightweight and have clear and crisp viewing. Then, after a week of normal use, one of the side pieces that goes behind your ear started to snap off at the hinge near the glasses part. I thought maybe I just had a defective pair and threw them away.I bought a 3 pack all of that same style, because I love how they look, and within TWO days, the exact same thing happened to one of them (as pictured). Two separate orders, two separate glasses (same style but different colors), this can't be a defect.Then four days later, the plastic part near the inside of the nose randomly breaks off a different pair (as pictured). This part connects to the plastic over the glasses which lifts up every time I try to wear them now.Three sunglasses all breaking within a week of use? No. These sunglasses are stylish but are made of cheap, brittle plastic. These are not inexpensive glasses rather they're cheap quality glasses. If you want them to just look cute for a few wears then they're worth it for just that, however, don't rely on these being around for more than a couple of weeks.

  So I was looking for a reasonably priced pair of replacements for my last pair of sunglasses that were sadly lost. I knew I wanted something good but didn't want to drop more than $100 bucks like I did on my old glasses.  At the end of the day, sunglasses get used often and sometimes in the hustle of life they either are lost or get broken.After spending some time looking around and comparing options I settled on this pair because for the price 2 are better than one. I have not been disappointed. They are light weight, they feel great on my face and they get the job done. Would be nice if they came with a case but they do include some nice cloth pouches to keep your glasses clean and safe when not in use. Overall very satisfied with my purchase.

  I haven‚Äôt done one of these in a long time, possibly ever, but these are great! I wish I could cuss a bit to emphasize how great these are. They‚Äôre super inexpensive ( I wish I had gotten the three pack now, instead of the two), but sturdy and protect my eyes great. I‚Äôm really pumped on these. And I‚Äôm actually telling all my buddies about them. No joke. They‚Äôre great.

  The product arrived as described. In the box was a dust wipe to remove excess dust as well as one storage case for the 3 pairs of glasses. The glasses are a bit lighter in shade and appear ""see through"" from the other side. They also seem to be rather flimsy but I guess when you buy 3 pairs at once you're expecting them to break over time.

  I purchased these sunglasses due to many great reviews, so hopefully this is a fluke. However, if it's not, I strongly suggest you not purchase these sunglasses. I wore the ""Wayfarer"" style glasses four times over the course of three days. The next thing I knew, I noticed the right lens lying on the ground. The frame snapped in two at the top and the lens popped out while they were on my face. The ""Clubmaster"" style glasses were my back-ups. After one wear I noticed the frame starting to crack at the top of the left lens. In essence, this is one of those situations where you get what you paid for - and I'm out 20 bucks. I'd also note that while the lenses are polarized and seem pretty nice, there is a tint of blue for the ""Wayfarer"" and red for the ""Clubmaster"" which can and does get annoying (not good for driving, especially).

  I break and sunglasses too much to get Raybans, so these are the next best thing. It doesn‚Äôt make things as dark as Raybans do, but since I have a sunlight sensitive eye color, it keeps my eyes from hurting even when the sun is out. Only thing is that you have rainbow  peripheral vision but it‚Äôs not too bad. I love them.

  Cannot find a better pair of sunglasses for the price! It comes with a cool polarized card to check your lenses, I compared them with my $220 Ray Bans and they we're identical. They're very light and can be worn all day no problem.  The brown frames with the blue lens are my favorite but you can't go wrong with any of them!! These are perfect for a family vacation everybody gets a pair and if you lose or break them it's no big deal. Ordering more for bachelor party!

  Stylish polarized sunglasses. They're a bit smaller than I expected, but they are also a lot sturdier than expected. Would recommend for anyone looking for a nice pair of relatively cheap, polarized sunglasses! Also great that they come in pairs! But there is only one bag to hold your sunglasses (which can hold both pairs but not ideal if you're giving one of the sunglasses to someone else).

  Handsome sunglasses, comfortable, tight temples, good sun protection (I can feel the glare relief, but I have no scientific way to measure effectiveness of the UV block) . Comes with a micro cleaning cloth and storage pouch. So, for $10, great deal.Their only problem is they're not 100% optically clear. When I stared at an object, and moved my head around, passing all areas of the lens over the object, I noticed some ""wavy"" spots where the lens wasn't perfectly things.It isn't really noticeable though when you're outside in the sun doing stuff. I'm just a perfectionist photographer and notice these things. I'm also very unlucky (TWO new beam wiper blades I bought for my car make the same exact smear on my windshield in the exact same spot in the center of my vision), so you may get a pair that's fine.

  Edit 12/29/2020- the film on the glasses has begun to peel and come off the lenses. The glasses have been hard to use since that happened. I really wanted these to be great but you get what you pay for. These are not good for long term.These sunglasses have been great for driving and going to the beach. They are lightweight and polarized which makes them a dream when sitting on the beach. Since they‚Äôre such a good price I‚Äôm not freaking out if I lose them while swimming.

  These are okay. They are polarized, which is nice, but the build quality is not very good. I like the style, and I like the price, but the inside of the lenses is too reflective, or maybe the lenses are not curved enough, but I am constantly seeing reflections in the lenses while I‚Äôm wearing these. It‚Äôs really distracting, especially while I am driving. Not going to recommend these, but the price was fair.

There should be a minimum of 3 fabric pouches. Although these pouches will not really protect the sunglasses.Overall good value and quality but should have included more accessories.

  What you would expect for cheap sunglasses the polarized test is bologna. I tried the image with a pair of spy sunglasses and the dolphin was there so my guess a coating that‚Äôs unique to their glasses. They are pretty flexible and will loosen over time. The vision is good but when compared to other brands they are ok not as clear just dark. The lenses scratch easily and are hard to wipe clean even with the case. You get what you pay for and they worked well for what I needed but by no means will these be your number one sunglasses in my opinion.

  I'm a fan of inexpensive sunglasses. I have an expensive designer pair but those lenses get dirty and streaky very easily. I much prefer ordering a few pairs at a time and if they break or the lenses get scratched, I don't feel bad about recycling them and starting over with a new pair. These don't look ""cheap"" and the lenses block the sunlight.

  The glasses were very scratched when I received them today. All I had done was take them out of the package (keeping the sticker and tag were still on) and put them on. I quickly realized I could not see out of my right eye and figured it was due to scratches on the inside of the glasses! A huge disappointment and frustrating since I do not think they are wearable. I would definitely recommend getting a different pair of glasses.

  I have a small face so most sunglasses don't fit me. I was worried these would be the same but have struck out everywhere that I can try them on in person so I decided to give these a try. These actually fit and compliment my face really well. They are also well made, sturdy, and look and feel like expensive glasses (I got the matte black) . They are also polarized and UV blocking. Everything looks much clearer and vibrant in these due to getting polarized and my eyes are being protected from harmful rays which is highly important while wearing contacts.

  These have been my go-to glasses. Pretty high quality for the price, and it doesn‚Äôt hurt when they‚Äôre claimed by the lake or left somewhere. The lenses can scratch a bit easier than premium brands, but they‚Äôre great otherwise. I‚Äôve bought a ton of pairs over the past several years.

  I purchased these sunglasses not expecting much but once I received them I immediately realized that I made the right decision. The packaging was clean and neat, but beyond that the sunglasses were truly polarized and it works so well. You could easily mistake these for a big brand name pair of sunglasses because of the quality. I would absolutely recommend these to anyone!

  Love!!! I had worn a pair to a family gathering & a cousin had a pair that were Ray Ban brand that looked identical to these. We actually had a hard time deciphering which was which without looking at hers that said Ray Ban. These are one twentieth the cost of designer brands of course so it's a no brainier. These are lightweight, adjustable, & will look good on literally anyone. This is my second time buying the 3 pack because I just can't speak to how awesome they are. These are GREAT gift ideas too! Buy them all!

  These are lightweight sunglasses that mimic the uber-expensive brands out on the market. Of course there are differences that separate the two, but for the price, you can‚Äôt go wrong. They are very light on the bridge of your nose, and my favorite part is that they are made of a rubber material, so they don‚Äôt slip and slide, especially in hot weather. You are given two pairs of glasses, one being more generic in shape, and with a wider lens, so it can be used by men or women, and the other has a retro ‚Äúcat‚Äù glasses vibe to it, which is definitely suited for the ladies, and a bit more dressy/stylish. I highly encourage anyone on the fence to purchase these fabulous finds!

",5.0,Garrett,"Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2021","









  
  
    
  The glasses themselves work perfectly in the sun when driving, which is why I purchased them. But the silver trim on one of them is thin which slips when in different positions and feels either too tight and close to your eyes or loose at the bridge of the nose. I just prefer not to wear them but they work just as well, but my nose may not be the right fit. They came with a nice case but only one.

  Needed a new pair of shades to protect my eyes from the sun while driving, but wanted to keep the cost low. I came across these on Amazon. These are very NICE shades for the price. I purchased the two pack and I LOVE them. They are better quality than you would get in the stores, not cheap plastic. NO they are not high end (duh), but they appear to be well made. They include a polarized tester allowing you to see the stark difference between no polarization versus polarization. Glad I came across these. Also, you get two microfiber cloths and two microfibers pouches to hold the glasses (if you buy the two pack). I like the pouches much better because they don't take up as much space as the cases. Lastly, they have a FREE replacement within one year if you have quality issues and a LIFETIME breakage warranty. HOW AWESOME IS THAT! You get a free repair or replacement on damaged parts. I almost put that card in the trash, glad I took the time to read it. If you are in need of a new pair of shades and don't want to break the bank - give these a try.

  Wear sunglasses every day, whether cloudy, sunny, snow, beach, on water or light rain. Keep spare in each car in purse. Sensitive to glare. These are very comfortable, did not slip off, pinch my nose, give me a headache or hurt my ears. Modern style. Change my glasses daily to compliment outfit. Have a small collection but refuse to pay alot. Light weight. I have broad face, worried they'd look too small but they were fine. Wished the lenses were a bit bigger but ok. Loved the polarized eye protection. Can ""see"" the differenceüòé

  Here's the lo down.  I didn't know what to expect with these glasses.  They have lasted 7 months with semi regular use.  But alas, they now are broken.  Here's my take:Pros:Rediculously comfortable: seriously sometimes forgot they were on my face.Price point: pretty cheap for what you are getting.  They do feel a little cheap upon first handling but they sort of ""break in"" if you will.Cons:Film: as you can see in image, the film is peeling and bubbling.  This started about 3 months ago.  Maybe I needed to clean more often and store in their fabric case more often?Cheap construction:  this almost is a double edged sword.  They are light and they goes a long way for weight on your nose bridge.  But, their construction is plastic-y.  I went to remove the glasses from my head yesterday and the arm just broke at the hinging mechanism.Overall purchasing these sunglasses isn't a bad move but there's two considerations.  You will need to take special care of cleanliness and storage most likely.  Second, these are cheap but effective ... but for how long?  Participating in a purchase pattern of this sort of product obsolescence feels more like a subscription framework.If you want something to wear ever so often, go for it.  If you want something that has an ounce of staying power, spend more and get better quality.Nice while they lasted, RIP.

  For the price, these sunglasses are awesome. Not the best quality as I imagine they can break easily, but then they can be replaced for not much spent. (This is a bit wasteful in my opinion.) I‚Äôm deducting one star because my eyes are visible through the lenses. I wish the lenses were less transparent. Nevertheless, the rest of the product is great. I love the shape of the glasses. They combine angular with circular lenses in a fashionable way. I think they look very nice and go with any outfit. I also highly appreciate the thoughtful packaging. I was very impressed with the box the sunglasses came in as well as the protective coverings and cleaning cloths. Overall, I definitely recommend these if you‚Äôre looking for budget sunglasses of this trend.

  These shades are perfect for the price! I purchased the orange lens wayfarer and the black on black semi-rimless. They are made with sturdy materials and come with a nice microfiber bag and microfiber cleaning cloth. The wayfarers rims and arms have a soft rubber material over them which helps them from falling off your face.

  Well, it's big and it's wide. It makes buying eyewear difficult.When I put on normal sized glasses, the stems at the sides will dig into my temples and produce lumps on the top and bottom which makes it look like I have a fat head. I mean, I do, but I don't want it to look like I do.I get tired of buying the large over-sized styles of the 80s and 90s - you know, the aviators and huge Versace type frames. Otherwise it's the large sporty wrap arounds that you should only wear when doing sports.I usually only get to pick out fun retro styles when I stumble onto a pair at a flea market or the local Chinatown. But even then, fit is usually an issue.Well when I saw these As a !lightning deal with frames measuring 144, I decided to try them out.They fit nicely without squeezing/pinching at my temples.  The stems are also long enough that I can push these things on top of my head like a headband when I'm by the pool and don't need them but wanna keep my hair from falling down into my eyes.They are not the best quality, pretty light, but at $6 a pair, they'll do.  I'm not the type of person who constantly has sunglasses on.  I tend to keep them hanging from my neck of pushed up on the top of my head (where over time the lenses will get scratched) and will put them on only when needed. So these were perfect.Also each came with a little drawstring pouch and microfiber to wipe the lens, quite handy and thoughtful.Inexpensive, large and stylish.  I would buy them again at $6 a pair.

  Alright I get it, I got two pairs of sunglasses for $16. I guess I just had higher expectations. I lost a pair of $20 polarized sunglasses on the boat so I was looking to replace those. Where we boat polarized glasses are a near necessity to spot sandbars. These glasses if they are polarized are not polarized well if that's a thing. They don't work as polarized glasses for being able to see in to water etc as I had on my more expensive Ray Bans.One pair broke the first time I wore them (the wayfarer style) and they're now in the river. I'll continue my search for a decent and affordable pair of polarized glasses, these are not the ones.

  The glasses are decently made, especially for the price. I don't remember dimensions being provided on the product page and going by the pictures, I assumed these were adult size sunglasses. They are actually pretty small. If you're an average sized adult male 5'8"" or more, you should probably look elsewhere.On the positive side, the polarization is nice and even in direct sun I am able to see clearly, which is great for driving. I'll just have to pony up and get something larger (and probably more expensive).

  I broke/lost a few pairs of ray bans over the years and wasn‚Äôt willing to spend more on another pair. Luckily I was willing to try these out before splurging on another pair of expensive sunglasses.These are great sunglasses and they look really good. My only complaint is that the smaller one‚Äôs lens is ever so slightly curved so that there a tiny little bit magnification looking through them. Not even really noticeable though. Otherwise a great purchase, and they seem really durable.

  These were better than expected.  My son wanted a better pair of sunglasses and he likes this style in Ray Bans, I was not ready to pay that much till I knew he liked them and could take care of them.  After buying these, I really liked them so bought some for myself and the rest of our family.  The three pack options are great and come with cleansing cloth and bag to keep them from getting scratched.  I will only buy these from now on.  Fit perfectly, great in the sun, good near water.  The polarized is a bonus.  Not heavy at all, very comfortable.

  I am loving these sunglasses! I haven't been shopping for anything more than the basics in these COVID times, so thought I would check out the sunglasses here. I'm not a fancy person, but it is helpful when glasses fit your face. I was worried (I can't carry those 70's glasses look), but they are perfect! As well as very good sun protection, and not too close to my face (helping avoid the sunglass tan lines a little).They are also very sturdy, don't fall off my face, and generally don't get stuck in my hair (the catalyst for me looking for glasses in the first place). My hair is pretty much like a fuzzy Slash, so if they didn't get tangled in my hair, you're probably safe. They did get a little stuck in the eye pad part, but not bad. The hinge area & rest of the glasses are pretty smooth. I am happy!

  I changed my rating on this one to 5 stars.  It definitely is polarized, so these are officially my favorite sunglasses of all time.PROS: -comfortable -fit well -lightweight -dark tint -look niceCONS:NONE!!This part is what I'm eliminating from my review:**-the description says polarized, but every other pair of polarized glasses I've ever owned had some occasionally funky effects with LED screens and a bit of a rainbow pattern on tinted car windows.  These do not.While I don't miss those things, I have to wonder if they are really polarized.  If they aren't as advertised, do they really block UVA and UVB?**

  First impressions are fantastic - the packaging was nice and the glasses look and feel more expensive than they are. Comes with a case and microfiber cloth for each pair which is nice. Build quality appears to be solid, although I have only had them for a few hours so we‚Äôll see how well they hold up. I don‚Äôt like spending big money on sunglasses because I break or lose them way too often so I was looking for a pair or two of inexpensive but decent quality glasses in popular styles. These fit my requirements perfectly so far.

  First, getting two pairs for the price of one is always a plus. But when I put on these glasses, I feel like my vision is so heightened (which is probably just due to the polarized lenses). I can see clearly, but notice that if I'm looking at something black (like a black car) I see what looks like the light spectrum. At any rate, once you get over that, these glasses will become your go-to classes. I like that they go with anything and I've received compliments on both pair when I wear them.

  You pretty much get the look you want down and the style of glasses resembles those much more expensive. However, the quality does not match that of the more expensive brands. Mine is loose and flimsy and could easily break. If you want a quick and fast fashionable accessory, get these. Otherwise, invest in a more quality pair of glasses.

Instead of getting the 3 pack of matte glasses that I ordered, I got 2 matte and one glossy. Either I received the wrong pair or the product description doesn't clarify that one of them would be glossy. Either way the product descriptions should be more helpful rather than having to study the pictures.  Its not the end of the world but I definitely would've preferred them all to be matte.

  If you just need sunglasses but don't really care about quality, this'll work. Just be sure to measure your head compared to the width of these frames. I think they are on the narrow end for folks with small heads like me. Other than that, can't complain much at this price point.They are polarized and light.

  I understand these are cheap Ray-Ban knock-offs.  I don't expect the same quality as the originals.  These look pretty good.  The frames are definitely thinner and lighter weight.  The Wayfarer style fits well.  The Clubmaster style not so much.  These are totally unwearable as the lenses are foggy.  It's like looking through vaseline.  My eyes hurt within 30 seconds of putting them on INDOORS!  The optics are the worst I have ever put on my face.  I'm not going to risk the health of my eyes.  These are going back immediately!!!

The only thing I don't like is I wish I can curve the glasses but it doesn't feel like you should bend them. I do recommend these glasses, the description is exactly as it says and you won't regret.

  The products are great! They are high quality and extremely comfortable. As a former employee of sunglass hut, I can honestly say that these glasses are the best replacement for Ray-Bans I‚Äôve ever owned. I‚Äôve had several pairs of the ‚Äúofficial‚Äù club masters and I have to say that for the price, there‚Äôs not one reason I wouldn‚Äôt pick these first. For a pair of polarized lenses (usually a $50+ price bump) these are BEYOND worth the money. The plastic is noticeably lighter than the $150 store brands but I believe that‚Äôs one reason I am able to wear them all day without any discomfort. The all black color option is by far my favorite and has a beautiful look to it, while the tortoise shell color has a clean matte finish that you can‚Äôt usually find in stores, only the customized pairs. The build is light but sturdy, extremely comfortable and flexible around the nose, and an even cleaner without all the branding marks all over them. 3 pairs allows me to keep one in the car, one at home and bring a pair wherever I go, while the extremely low price makes it so that I don‚Äôt have to ‚Äúbaby‚Äù my frames and can actually wear them without worry. That, or just switch up the options to pair them perfectly no matter the outfit or occasion. 100% great buy and I think I just found my new go-to frames :)To put it in short form: if you want the Ray-Ban look and quality but can‚Äôt afford $150+, getting 3 pair of these for $20 may be the best all around deal on the market.

  Hey fellow buyers, firstly I have ordered a few Amazon shades and I usually get what I pay for, but these puppies are a steal. Both pairs are actually high quality whereas I thought the plastic ones would be cheap. They fit really well and for the price you can‚Äôt go wrong. At the mall these would be at least $30-60, so if you wanna get some nice glasses for a realistic price these are the way to go. Also they come with a little polarization tester which I thought was an awesome touch. I hope this company conuines to have reasonable prices and quality products.

Somehow this morning they broke, I set them in my cup holder in my car and came back out 45 minutes later and they were completely cracked by the screw that attaches the arms to the lenses. I‚Äôm very disappointed because I really liked the way they looked on me.

  For the price, these are definitely worth a look. The frame has a substantial weighty plastic that doesn't feel like it will crumble into dust like some other glasses I've purchased, the hinges aren't spring-assisted but still feel sturdy and move smoothly. The lenses are dark, but not enough to feel like I'm wearing welding goggles if I walk indoors or drive through a tunnel. The polarization can make using a laptop or my phone a slight challenge depending on the angle, but that's really not a big deal.

  I love everything about these glasses besides 1 thing, the pair that have rubber nose pads fell off fairly easily. This would not be a huge issue if they did not become very uncomfortable afterwards. Otherwise I do love the glasses, I would recommend getting a pair that did not need the rubber pads.

  I like these glasses because they have a nose piece for me. I do not have a large nose bridge and need that extra piece to help hold glasses on my face. These are light weight and I do feel they could break easily, however they have not yet broken. You can't beat the price!

  Pretty good quality for some inexpensive shades. The nose pieces are adjustable and seem like they will hold up to multiple adjustments. Comes with one cloth carrying/cleaning case and cleaning cloth. It also came with a neat polarization check card with a dolphin on it. The polarization is decent while still allowing me to use my phone.

  Found these sunglasses to be a pretty good value overall.  The quality was a little better than I expected for the price. I really like the looks, and the polarized lenses offer ample eye protection without being too dark.  The only thing that prevents me from giving a 5 star rating is the fact that they are a bit too light.  I would like them more if they were a little heavier, with a more substantial feel.  Otherwise, these are of reasonably decent quality, and are a much more affordable alternative to Ray-Ban Clubmaster sunglasses.

  Like most of you, I was skeptical. TWO pair of really nice looking shades for under $20 bucks...they have to be cheap quality or uncomfortable. Well, I'm happy to say that I purchase these in matte black and they are OUTSTANDING! I can't believe it...they look good, they're comfortable, they actually work very well as polarized shades. I'm telling you CANNOT go wrong with this purchase. There's a reason why these are 4.5 stars with almost 6,300 reviews! These make really awesome gifts that won't break the bank. I use these while riding my motorcycle and they fit well under my helmet. No pressure points and no pinching. I highly recommend these polarized sunglasses.

  Needed to replace a pair of Ray-Ban Wayfarers that got stolen out of my car.  These glasses stayed in the car and used primarily for driving.  After taking a hit for an expensive pair, I decided to see if a less expensive quality replacement was out there that I did not mind losing.A quick online vide review search lead me to these.I rwceived them yesterday and immediately noticed that they wor higher quality than your average discount  sunglasses that you would find on a rack.  The frames material felt like high quality plastic, not brittle at all. The hinges were well secured and did were not squeaky and opened smoothly.  The lenses seem like lenses and not cellophane. The big test came when I drove east into the sun the next morning.  Firstly, looking into the sun was clear with no blur from the glare that should have been there.  There was no graininess that is very apparent in cheap glasses.  The colora although darker, appeared accurate.  They were absolutely amazing.The set of glasses also came with individual bags and cleaning cloths, as well as being packaged in a sturdy box.  These are excellent glassses...well made and dies the job. I highly recommend.

  Got this pack as a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas since he always misplaces his. I was surprised by the quality since the price was so low for all three pairs and it's perfect that theres three so I can always steal a pair to wear also. Would definitely buy again.

    Wonderful Sunglasses For The Cheap

  These things are absolutely amazing for the price they come in at. They are sturdy, feel good, do not look cheap, and offer great sun protection. They even come with a bag to carry it in and a lens cleaning fabric. Highly recommend.

  These are awesome glasses.  They easily beat similar brand names that cost 10 times as much.  I can‚Äôt imagine paying for the brand name unless you just need it to bolster your self confidence...

  I love both! They are lightweight,  but not cheap.
