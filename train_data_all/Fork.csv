  After about six months of light use I noticed the insides of the tines were rusting. There are a lot of good reviews and also a number of reviews stating that the forks rusted, so apparently there is inconsistent quality of manufacturing. Until the rust appeared I was happy with the size, weight, design of the forks. Then I threw them all out so I don't have rust mixed in with my food.

  I was really surprised at the quality of these forks. I've had them for a few months and they are completely dishwasher safe and sturdy. I bought these to replace my higher priced forks since my kids kept taking them to school and losing them; however, these feel like the same weight as the more expensive silverware. I ordered spoons and knives to match.

  I ordered a set of forks for our vacation property. We rent out the property when we are not using it and often need to replace things  lost or ruined by renters. I selected these forks based on the description and was blown away by the quality and strength of these forks.  They are a much higher quality than I expected and should last forever if not longer. They are a plain pattern which is great because they blend in with other sets. I doubt any future renters in our cabin will be able to destroy these! They seem indestructible.

  This is literally the greatest fork I have ever had the pleasure of holding in my hand. From the moment I touched it I knew that I would never be satisfied holding another fork again. It's so ergonomically pleasing, with a gentle curve that allows it to rest delicately in your hand. It works for both right handed people and left handed people which is great. This fork actually enhances the way that food tastes. I am so pleased with this decision. Thank you HiWare for such a superior product. 100/10.

Due to COVID-19 I haven't been able to find forks that can be purchased separately and not in sets, but also look and feel durable, not the cheap bendable metal ones.

  They look nice, feel nice, and generally seem like good forks.  However, one is already rusty after 5 months- and it's mostly been sitting in a drawer because we didn't really need 12 forks.  Still, for the price if just this one rusts, meh I won't really care.  But if you're thinking ""I really need 12 forks and I'm planning to throw my other forks away because all my forks MUST match"", you may be upset when one rusts after some months.The rusty one has many rusty spots.  The others all have zero rusty spots.  So maybe that one just didn't get made right, who knows.  If the others turn up rusty in a few more months, I'll change my review.

  I was looking for some nice, simple, heavy forks to have for our Thanksgiving Dinner this year and these were perfectly simple like I wanted but were not as heavy weight as I thought they were going to be by looking at the pictures. I wish they were a little thicker. I like a meaty fork for a meaty dinner if you know what I mean! Although, I did keep them for backups for other large gatherings that I hope to have in the coming years because of the price but will not use again for this important dinner again. I will be going back to something like Pfatzgraff next time

They came nicely packaged, have been through the dishwasher, and came out nice and shiny. No rough edges. I'm happy with them.

  Great Product and conveniently sold as a pack of only forks, which is the only utensil that I really needed more of! I have an excessive amount of spoons and knives in all different sizes, but somehow over time, many of our forks have gone missing. I haven't been able to find a set of good forks sold as a pack at any of the home goods stores nearby. Frustratingly, my only in-store options have been to either buy the entire dinner utensil set, which will give me even more spoons and knives that I do not need, and therefore do not want to spend on; and then only get a few forks out of the deal (in my case, not a good deal). The only other option I've seen at the stores is to buy the forks individually, but when you need more than just a few, like I did, then this option gets expensive very quick (also not a good deal). Maybe I've just been shopping at the wrong stores, but this 12-peice set of forks was exactly what I was looking for... I should have just started my search here to save me the trouble and irritation. Anyway, I am very happy with this product, they work just as forks should, and more importantly I know I spent my money on items that we will get full use of in my household.

  These forks left black residue in a hotdog that I was cutting up for my child. I tested several of the forks and they all did it. I then poked the hotdogs with some of our older forks and no black a spots. Disgusting. I'm sending these back. (Yes, we machine washed the forks before use)

  Excellent and ideal for eating with. Excellent prod and spear action, can handle several peas at once due to carefully engineered tine spacing. Swiftly brings cake to your mouth for a pleasing experience. Be careful as the sharp end is pokey and it could get in your eye with over enthusiastic shoveling. A bit crap for soup but overall a good and useful device.

I really liked their simple yet graceful lines, but wondered how they would feel.  I ordered a set of spoons, and I was not disappointed.  The weight was perfect, the edges were smooth to the touch (important to a tactile-sensitive person like me), and they were very smart-looking with all of my dishware!  I love them so much that I ordered the forks this time.  Again...I am so pleased!  Dinner spoons are next...then knives.  I hope this style is never discontinued!

  I am not one to leave reviews often, but sadly, this one I had too. The first time I ordered these, the quality was wonderful. They were sturdy, easy to handle, smooth and rounded edges and looked great. Unfortunately either the vendor you purchase from, or the company that now makes these for you has let their quality drop. The set i just purchased was far less superior than the first; approximately 2 years in between orders. They are less sturdy, finish was not as good, shape was slightly different, and edges were not as smooth. New ones have a  hard edge that you feel in your hand catching your fingers when using. I would return them if I thought I could get a set of the original ones I ordered.

  I really like these forks.  They are thick and sturdy and work well.  Be aware that the bottom flares out a bit, so it nearly didn't fit inside my dishwasher silverware slots.  The real reason why I gave them four stars instead of five though, was because it left a black residue on our fingers when we used them, that was even after washing them in the dishwasher before using them for the first time.  It looks like the polish wasn't fully removed at the factory, so after some scrubbing and polishing by hand, they were good to go.

  Like other reviewers I never had enough forks to last before I ran the dishwasher.  I was always digging around in the dishwasher and having to hand wash a couple.  These forks look enough like my stainless set that it is hard to tell they don't belong.  The tines, however, are a different length and are between the length of my salad and dinner forks.  They are also a bit lighter in weight.  Still, it is nice to have forks whenever I need them!I looked up my set and discovered they are extremely expensive.  So, it was nice to get replacements that were affordable!

  Got these forks because I have spent the last 10 years with just a couple of forks and I finally got tired of washing a fork every time I want to eat. The quality of these forks is far better than the cheap dollar store ones I had been using. I didn't know quality in a fork made much difference but these feel very sturdy but they're also fairly light in weight. I would recommend these forks to anyone looking for a good set for everyday use.

  The nice thing about these forks is they have a handle and all four tines. Have you tried using a fork without a handle? Total hassle.

  We harbor an evil-doer in the office who eats cup noodles with a plastic fork and returns the ""washed"" fork to the drawer afterwards. Imagine me‚Äîusually a pretty easygoing, happy individual‚Äîwho then picks up said fork and begins to eat my lunch with it, only to discover that it had already been used, evident by all the food stuck in its hard-to-wash crevices.These kill two birds with one stone. First, they're not plastic. Second, they have no grooves or crevices were food can get stuck. Even if you have no dish washing talent, you can do a quick swish swish with a sponge and still be able to get it clean. Yes Ryan, that means you.

    Amazing Forks!
  
",5.0,Nicole Miller,"Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2019","









  
  
    
  We are a household of 2 grown adults, so how forks disappear constantly is beyond me. We need more forks so we took a shot at these because of the amazing reviews and great value. They do not disappoint. They are sturdy and do exactly what a fork should do. Also, the weight of these forks feel great. They are heavier than my other forks (in a good way). I would definitely recommend.

  I needed a few extra forks and was surprised at the price for the other ""name brand"" forks.  So, I decided to give the Amazon Essentials forks a try.  The forks are excellent quality.  Nice weight, nice feel, comfortable.  They feel and look much more expensive than they are.  Definitely worth the money and I highly recommend.  When it's time to add spoons, I'll order the same brand
