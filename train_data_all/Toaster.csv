  What a great little gadget this is. It does everything a regular oven does and more. I am thrilled that I can get the perfect grilled cheese sandwich in only minutes. My kids are into melted cheese in their sandwiches as of late. I am happy I can throw some in the over while I get them ready for school. It gives me the peace of mind that they have a good breakfast on their way to school every morning.

  I like that is doesn't take up much space on the counter and it is sleek and well built. What I don't like is that the controls have very small print and some are grayed out which makes them very hard to read. I had to bend over and get up close to see them at all when i first got it. Knobs are still and hard to turn and it takes longer than i would expect (from a previous toaster/oven) to toast a piece of bread or muffin. Only used for toasting, no baking yet.

    Takes way too long to make toast
  
",2.0,Beth Martorano,"Reviewed in the United States September 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  I never write product reviews but am compelled to do so so that others are aware of what to expect. It takes 2 cycles on the ‚Äúdark‚Äù toast setting to make toast which ends up taking way too long (well over 7 minutes) and by then the edges of the bread get burned. You also have to be careful when opening The oven doors because you can easily get burned where the handle and the oven door meet.  I would not recommend this toaster oven.

  I love that this toasts items, I always want my pizza or subs extra well done and this allows me to do so without cooking everything extra long. The tray is easy to clean even with melted cheese and bbq sauce on it. I threw my regular toaster in a cupboard and use this bad boy instead. Kids love that they can cook pizza rolls and bagels in it quickly too. No complaints and I dont see this moving off of my counter anytime soon.

  I read so many positive reviews, I thought I was getting a toaster oven to end all toaster ovens.4 pizza slices? Baby slices, maybe? It barely shuts on 2 regular ones.Neither the rack nor tray fit into the frame. The tray can only be used on the rack, which barely fills the frame - each time I pull it out it drops. I'm surprised it stays put while baking!And while the timer is a great feature, why does it take more than 10 minutes to reheat frozen pizza? I find it's very slow.

  I was glad to see the small size since I didn't want a big appliance taking up more room than I wanted.  It has just one rack which is fine, and holds 4 slices of bread or a 9"" pizza.  I can do a small pan of brownies or cake.  It looks well built, so I am hopeful it will last.  One problem is the small type at the knobs, but I am getting used to where to set them.  Very happy with my purchase (even though UPS delivered it to my neighbor, but he brought it to me!).

  Well, I was looking for a compact toaster oven that I could use to bake and toast.  This oven has a couple of problems, one it isn‚Äôt east to clean (no removable tray at the bottom) and if not cleaned after each use it smokes, setting off my fire alarm.  Two it does not toast evenly which surprised me, as most toaster ovens do at least toast more than one strip.

  This is an excellent toaster oven, especially for the money.  It doesn't take up too much room on the countertop and works well for toasting and baking.  The only downside I have found is that if you set the timer for too long it is difficult to turn the know backwards to shut it off.  However, I would definitely recommend this product.

    nice little toaster oven
  
",5.0,K. Kelly,"Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  We are hard on toaster ovens, so we go through a lot of them.  We like this one because the body is black and the face is easy to clean and mostly stainless.  One small issue is that it is hard to eyeball where the temperature is set because the pointer on the knob is in the front and the scale is in the back.  We recommend that the manufacturer add an inscribed line on the knob back to the scale printed on the face of the oven to make the reading more accurate.  You can always add a dot there yourself with a sharpie pen.

  This product - regardless of description - DOES NOT HAVE A REMOVABLE CRUMB TRAY.  On top of all that, the middle rack doesn't have a ""stop"" so it comes flying out with your food and is a floor and foot hazard.  Heats unevenly...Buns not toasted on top, burnt on the bottom.  Price may be attractive but this is NOT the toaster oven for you if you need it to be functional.

    Gets the job done
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2021","









  
  
    
  This is the first real toaster oven I've purchased in years. Admittedly, I hadn't used them often (except for tempering knife forgings, but that's a story for another day) as there was always the conventional oven to bake in.I mainly ordered this as a ""backup"" while the main oven is under maintenance. Most cooking is done stove top these days, but the 1-2 times I needed this (specifically, baking a loaf of almond flour bread to perfection), it's gotten the job done just fine. I also appreciate the timer knob, that I know comes with most toaster ovens, but does take away some of the worry of burning things, especially when you live a busy life.So far, can't find anything to be discontent about it. Created a plume of smoke with some silicone loaf pans, but that wasn't its fault. Happy otherwise!

  Just received my Mueller Toaster Oven.  It was well packaged and delivered promptly.  This is a great little toaster oven. It comes with a rack and baking tray. The crumb tray opens up easily and will be handy to keep clean. There is an Instruction Manual and Recipe book also included.  The 3 knobs on the oven are for Temperature, Function, and Time.  They are very easy to use. Please note that the settings are manual and are not digital which I really like. Less likely to have problems with it. Temperature ranges from 150-450 degrees. There are 3 Function choices designated with an icon - Bake, Broil and Toast. The timer goes up to 30 minutes or you can use without a time control by turning knob to Stay On position.  I christened the toaster/oven by making toast! I turned temp to Max, turned the Function knob to the Toast icon and set the timer for Darker setting. It took longer than a regular toaster but I was testing it and will have to adjust. Also baked biscuits in it which turned out great and didn‚Äôt have to use all the electricity to pre-heat and bake in my range. A Temperature Guide for different kinds of foods is included in the Instruction Manual.  I am very pleased and happy with this purchase.  The Mueller oven has a sleek design, is multi functional, and so easy to use.  I would highly recommend if you are looking for a toaster oven.

  Everything about this stove is poorly designed.  I cannot for the life of me imagine that this stove was allowed to be manufactured to be placed inside a home.  I set the temperature to 200 degrees and it climbed past 250 degrees ignoring my settings.  When you walk away and come back the temperature is always different and not consistent.  In addition, every surface is too hot to touch to include the bottom.  There is NO insulating properties to this stove.  THIS STOVE IS A FIRE HAZARD and should not be sold.  Amazon should immediately remove it from sales and refund anybody who has purchased it BEGGING them to throw them away.  PLEASE DO NOT purchase this ticking fire bomb.  EVERYBODY who gave this stove a thumbs up is being paid to do so.  There is absolutely NO WAY ANYBODY within reason would ever encourage ANYBODY to purchase this device.  There are some exceptions:1. You are ice fishing and you need to burn a hole through 8 feet of solid ice.  You can set it to ANY temperature and stand back.2.  You need a ""toaster"" oven that can work secondarily as a forge.  Blacksmiths may find its light weight ideal for moving about for demonstrations.3. You are trying to collect insurance money by BURNING YOUR HOUSE DOWN.4.  You want to melt various metals into ingots for jewelry making.5.  You want to divorce your partner who is a foodie by burning anything and everything you place into the oven.6.  You would like to make your own charcoal.7.  You need to heat a large warehouse in subzero temperatures.8.  You need to forge weld ANYTHING together.  Example: Forge welding diamond to titanium.

  As the reviews stated this unit will smoke a little and smell when you first turn it on and continue for several cycles so dont cook right away.It is most likely the heat elements and inside burning off the coatings and dust from manafacturing.I have had many for years and use it dailyIt will take a little getting used to the dials because the settings are not digital. It heats up fast and works well.So far I have made toast at least 4 times a week, cooked chicken and broiled fish.Easy and basic to get used to. Some folks stated that it burned toast. Well, at first you have to watch it and you can see it brown. Then you will know where to turn the knob to. It is not a precision knob.I like this little unitYou can not turn the cooking knob down once it is set but there is a quick easy dial that will turn it off.It is basic and durable, that is what I wanted.I replaced an Oster that cost over 200 dollars because it was too big and I needed counter space.Feel free to check in months from now and I will be happy to share its longevity.

    Modest, functional appliance for a small kitchen
  
",4.0,rosychan,"Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2021","









  
  
    
  We live in a small apt in a retirement community where we don't need to do much cooking. So we don't need a high functioning, big toaster oven that does everything taking up a lot of space. This sweet little thing fits very compactly on our kitchen counter, & does everything we need:  toasting breads (including ones that are too fragile to go in a standard toaster), heating up pastries & fries that would go soggy in a microwave, grilled cheese sandwich. I understand this oven can also bake fish & roast meat, but we're vegetarian so we haven't tried that. SO- if you don't want a big toaster oven that does everything short of chewing your food, but instead, something compact, low end but very functional, works well, this is for you. Oh, one more thing, the rack does not come out when you open the door so another reviewer suggested folding up a little piece of foil & wrapping it around the end of the rack with about an inch hanging down to use to pull the rack out when hot. Great suggestion! Another review lamented the non-removable crumb tray. Solution: for $10 you can get 2 teflon oven liner sheets (can be cut to fit), dishwasher safe, catches crumbs & drips. So you can open bottom & slide this out as if it were a crumb tray, & wash it. https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01KTY6XOS?psc=1&ref=ppx_pop_dt_b_product_details

",4.0,Majombaszo,"Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2021","









  
  
    
  This is a great little toaster oven. It's basic and no frills and exactly what I was looking for. It doesn't do anything fancy and I did not want a toaster oven that did nor did I want to pay for all the fancy features that I would never use. This is surprisingly difficult to find.I highly recommend buying a reusable silicone liner for the bottom - or just using some foil - because it's a bit difficult to clean the bottom due to the placement of the bottom element. It's not a huge inconvenience and it's easily solved with the aforementioned liner or foil.The only true negative thing I have to say about this toaster oven is that twisting the knob to turn it off is difficult. Well, it's not difficult exactly but it does have resistance to the point where I feel like I'm doing something wrong and it might break. It hasn't broken and I don't think it will, it just feels that way.Overall, it's a good buy. Do it.

    Awful toaster
  
",1.0,Lisa,"Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2019","









  
  
    
  The first thing I noticed is that the toaster does not allow for you to adjust (decrease) the amount of time you want your food in the toaster.  If you set it for 10 minutes and then decide to change it to 5 minutes, the knob does not allow you to decrease the time.  It only allows you to increase the time.  So if you set the timer for 10 minutes and take your food out of the toaster after only five minutes, the toaster will continue running for another five minutes.  Secondly, and most importantly, the toaster takes forever to heat anything up.  As an example, I recently took a pancake out of the fridge (it was not frozen) and put it in the toaster for ten minutes.  By the end, it was barely luke warm.  Even when I use the baking function at the highest temperate possible (450 degrees), it takes an extraordinarily long time to heat anything up.  Don't waste your money on this.

  This is a small oven, good if you have limited space. What I like about this oven is that the heating elements have a metal guard to shield from melted cheese and crumbs landing on them. This oven toasts quickly so you will have to watch it and experiment with the temperature settings. For me, this is not a problem. This little oven heats up fast. So far, I've only used it for toast and heating up leftover pizza. The crumb tray doesn't come out. There is a knob on the bottom which opens up but stays attached to the appliance.

",4.0,Karla Calder,"Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2019","









  
  
    
  The heat generated from such a small device is impressive.  Heats up to 450 quickly.  But it is not so much a toaster oven as there is no toast setting.  You have to set a timer and then watch to make sure it is not burning.  The rack settings are either 2/3 of the way up or 2/3 of the way down so unlike a toaster which is designed to toast evenly this will toast one side more than the other based on positioning of the rack.  As an mini it is great.  But I planned to use more as a toaster.  Having said that I did make garlic toast which came out well after I adjusted the wire rack during the toasting process.  But I did have to pay close attention to the toast so it did not burn.  For all other purposes seems to be a nice little unit.

Having owned numerous toaster ovens over the years I have never had this issue to the extent where I have to keep an eye on it every time that I toast anything.  The baking function is much more reliable. I have not used the broil setting yet, so cannot  comment on that.

    This toaster is bad
  
",2.0,Sia,"Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  I don't understand why people give this thing high reviews... there are a few things just absolutely terrible about this.1. It is small. Of course you should know this, but just saying, it's pretty small for what you pay for.2. Heat distribution is not good. Some parts get way hotter than others. I can never get anything consistently crispy in it.3. This is the worst part of all... the tray at the bottom does NOT come off completely. It hinges open, but thats it. If you have stains or drippings that have burned onto the bottom, it is very difficult to clean since you can't take the tray out completely. Who the hell designs something like this?I wish I had gone with any other toaster oven. I didn't realize toaster ovens existed these days without removable crumb trays.

  I have had this oven for 2 months, and I use it every day. I no longer need my microwave for anything but popping popcorn. I prefer heating up leftovers in the mini oven, my sandwiches come out toasted and with melted cheese inside. It's a real game changer. My mornings have been so much better ever since I started heating up my sandwiches in it while I get ready for work. Having a warm meal every morning is the best thing to prep me for the day.

",1.0,Michael,"Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2019","









  
  
    
  I've had it for several months, the hinge started making strange noises like metal scraping plus a spring scratching noise, then the spring popped off of where it attaches to the door so the door falls open and smacks on the table. I can't keep the door closed without putting an object in front of it to hold it shut (dangerous)I tried fixing it by using needle nose pliers to reach in and grab the spring and put it back on the door - hurt my hand in the process - succeeded - then it popped off again.Very cheaply made and broke when it was too late to return it and too early to get good use out of it.

  I purchased this toaster oven after reading it's reviews... Although, it does work great & I've been very satisfied with it for the past month since I've had it.. The door will not stay closed, at first I thought there was a magnet somewhere holding it closed, but there isn't! I guess it's just a ""latch"" a the lower left side of the door which looks like it's not connecting to where it's supposed to.  I was going to attempt fixing it myself but am scared I will break it! Needless to say, it does still work & I've been using duct tape to hold it closed...

  Everything worked as expected but the oven has one major design flaw: the tray.  When it gets very hot ~400, the tray warps.  Imagine this, you put in a carefully constructed quesadilla, you put it on the tray and set it to toast on 400.  After a few minutes, BOIING, one corner of the tray will pop up and all the ingredients pour out of the tortilla and start burning on the tray.  This is inexcusible and significant has reduced its usefulness.  I try to put directly on the rack when possible, but its not convenient

    Decent small toaster oven but it should be easier to make TOAST
  
",4.0,Mark,"Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2018","









  
  
    
  Attractive smaller toaster oven. Glass and stainless steel on front, black top and sides. Seems to heat up fine.So far, I've only used it for toast. Unfortunately, most small toaster ovens these days, including this one, have forgotten that they are TOASTER ovens. The main function of a toaster? Set the browning level ONCE, then push your toast down for consistent toasting every day. My old Toastmaster toaster oven had that feature:  set the level, then push down a small lever; when the lever popped up, toast was done. On this oven, you have to set the time you want it to toast, every time. You need to first turn the dial past five minutes, then twist it back to light, medium, or dark, or somewhere in between. It's difficult to position the knob in small increments, so the level is inconsistent, plus the smooth knob is difficult to turn backwards, pretty much impossible with wet fingers. I may wrap the knob in medical tape to make it easier to grip.By the way, although the description says ""Replacement period is UNLIMITED!"", that apparently refers to an onion chopper, not this product. According to the manual, the warranty is two years.Overall this will probably be fine as a small oven and even, with some care, for toasting. Just want to remind the designers that a TOASTER oven should make toasting easier.

  Solid toaster over, my issue is with the design.  The way the controls work is not ideal and therefore you have to manage toasting with a dial control instead of a push down button.  This makes it tricky to figure out how long to toast things for.  Also you have to remember to check another dial to ensure it will activate the right heating elements.  So it works as promised, is easy to clean but could‚Äôve been engineered better.

  I have a small counter space for a toaster oven.  The options for small toasters in a mid-range price point are pretty limited.  This fits that need, but it has some issues.Pros:* Small size* Solid build qualityCons:* Stink - The instructions say to run it for a while at a high temperature to burn off any leftover chemicals after wiping it down.  Months later, it still stinks at high temperatures.  We ran it for hours to burn off the stink, with no luck.  It's reduced over time, but still appears.* Uneven cooking - Back left corner browns toast much faster than other areas.  Can plan around it once you map it out, but at this price point is undesirable* Hard to clean - I didnt think I'd mind the drop out bottom, but moving the whole toaster, cord and all, over the sink to clean it is a bigger pain than I'd thought.* Very stiff knobs - easy to turn on, very hard to turn off.  If your hands are even a little damp, its basically impossible to shut off.

  Overall, we're very happy with this toaster oven.  The only thing that could be improved would be the design for the door.  It opens out so that food can be spilled on it.  It would be great if the door rolled up over the top so that it's out of the way when food is being put into or removed from the oven.  Other than that, we're very happy with our purchase.

    Not horrible but not unusable
  
",4.0,Angela Pilieci,"Reviewed in the United States May 14, 2019","









  
  
    
  I am giving this product a four star overall. The reason is because I realize how to use it properly. The heat is a bit uneven and to bake you need to have the machine for max time. The first few times of use it didn‚Äôt work very well but now it heats up well. Be wary of burning food though since the thing only heats on the bottom. The tray is the main issue when it comes to heat distribution. Its too thick. I have been using my old toaster ovens tray. I prefer not using a tray at all for the best results too. If you are toasting something, remember to flip whatever it is because again, the bottom heat is very powerful. The price is way to high for this.

  I was looking for a rather compact toaster oven to fit in a specific place. However it also meets all my usage needs. Door closes tightly, plenty of room for 1 huge pizza slice (or 2 regular!), 4 slices of bread and most things one or two people would use. Quiet until the bell rings (it's pleasant, not an obnoxious bell). Seems to heat evenly. Company also includes a sheet in the packaging saying that, because I purchased this, they will make a charitable donation (can't remember the group but it sounded like a good place). Didn't expect philanthropy so it was a nice extra touch. Respect a company that helps others too!  Good purchase I'd make again.

  I needed a toaster oven without spending over $100, NOT made in China...while this toaster fit both of those requirements, it failed nearly every other point.Firstly, the selection of modes is made by memory as even a 9 yr old couldn‚Äôt read the tiny print. The difference between burning something beyond recognition and hardly done, can only by accomplished by using the timer function (again, another guess).The lesson here is, there‚Äôs no options for inexpensive toaster ovens under $100!

  I doubt the temperature accuracy of this oven.  I didn't buy for toaster reasons but for small oven reasons and will buy a thermostat to set inside to determine accuracy.  Set it at product recommended temp , preheated and yet had to up the temp 25 degrees and still took 20 minutes longer than package advised (stuffed bread).  Also does not come with much of any directions on how to use.  One page plus picture printed fluff for air fry.  Only tried one air fry and not the best start.  Fresh sweet pototoes.  I don't buy processed food and will try other things before I finally comment on that function.  I do like the interior size but holding off judgement overall.

  My family uses toaster oven's for making toast a lot.  There's no dedicated timer knob for the toast functionality, so it's *real* difficult to set the timer to the right length for toasting.  And then after a couple weeks of use whatever spring or latch used to hold the door closed disappeared, so now something has to be wedged against the outside of the door while in use to keep it closed.  I'd recommend shopping for something else (as I'm about to do now).

This toaster oven heats very fast and thoroughly, and the user-friendly dials make it easy for anyone to use.It truly is like a mini oven as far as everything it can do, and is nice and compact so as not to take up all of your counterspace.The only reason I gave 4 stars is because it gets incredibly and INTENSELY hot to the touch, so I wouldn't have small kids using it the way they'd use a microwave.

  The first oven I received had some sort of power issue, and wouldn't turn on at all.  The company was great to send a replacement.  This replacement oven did turn on and functioned...sometimes.  It stops heating at times, even when there are 10-20 minutes left on the timer.  At first, I thought it was just stopping periodically to control the internal temp, but that wasn't the case. It would stop heating and then not come on again.  At other times, it worked fine, but it was a toss of the dice as to whether the food was going to heat up properly or not.  Toast burns on one side and stays almost completely untoasted on the other side. I contacted Amazon and am returning the oven, and will purchase another brand.

  It works acceptably good and it controls the temperature pretty good. But it is very cheaply made from very thin metal and the inside tray warps often . The Hight is too low for a non convection oven so it heats things a lot more by reflected heat; As a result you have to be extra careful and use some tricks to make the inside of the food cook before the surface burns.

  I was excited when this toaster oven came.  Great design.  However, I found it difficult to regulate the toasting.... that needs some fine tuning.  Also, I tried cooking biscuits in it a few times but each time there were problems... either the bottoms was burned and top not done... or after moving rack up the tops were burned and bottoms not done.  Before long the door started popping open and now the door is totally broken.  It's past the window for return so guess it's going in the trash.

    Complex toasting
  
",4.0,Nancy P,"Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  The toaster oven seems fine, but Iprimarily bought it to use as a toaster, and the process seems more complex than I had anticipated.  One must set three controls, the toaster and darkness range (expected), but also a temperature control.  Hopefully, we will figure it out. The back wall serving as the crumb tray also takes some getting used to, but I am hoping it will be effective.

  It's a nice and nifty tool to have if you're like me and just want to heat yourself up to something when working from home and don't need the extra hassle but can appreciate a nice looking appliance that your wife isn't totally against you having a hand in buying. It looks good in the kitchen, matches the rest of the appliances in the kitchen and works well enough to become a staple in my family's food routine.

  I have tried other toaster ovens in the past and they usually got returned for one reason or another, but this one is a keeper.  I love it.. I had trouble with it at first trying toast because the booklet is not clean on what temp. to put it on for toast. I didn't think you had to put it on a temperature.. I mean why right?  but my husband said it should be all the way up for the temperature on toast and it worked. the booklet doesnt give alot of info for me.  Kind of trial and error trying to figure it out. But I think I got it now!  In years past they use to have a hook from the rack that attached to the door remember that? I mean some toaster ovens and it was perfect. I haven't been able to find that since.  I don't know why they did away with that because when you opened the door the rack came right out and you could get your toast without having to reach in. I would love to see that feature again.. I hope the manufactureres of this toaster oven read this and add it.. Then this would be perfect..

If you're re-heating leftovers this will be fine.  If you're doing real cooking.... I'm going to return this and try to find better.Update:The seller saw this review and refunded my money.  I don't even have to return the thing.  Superior 5-star service from the seller.  Still a useless oven that doesn't get hot enough.

  We had our last toaster oven for 9 years and moved it to our basement kitchenette in favor of a newer, smaller model because I wanted something that didn't take up so much of the counter. Boy, am I disappointed. We have had this model for 10 months and I swapped out our old one because I was so frustrated!First; this toaster oven is difficult to clean. Instead of pulling out the bottom to clean like our older toaster oven, it has a trapdoor, which is completely counter-intuitive. Every time I clean it, I have a hard time getting it to open and then crumbs go everywhere. I have cut my finger twice on the lip of the trap door while trying to clean and get it open.Second, the heat distribution is kind of wonky, and we constantly are getting half burned toast or smoke.On low heat we seem to be able to reheat leftovers with little issue but I would definitely not recommend or buy again.EDITED TO ADD: After posting my original 2 Star review, Customer Service reached out to me and we were able to come to a solution regarding my poor experience with this toaster oven. I was very impressed! Have changed my 2 Stars to 4 Stars based on that correspondence. Thanks.

  Can't have digital toaster oven because of power surges in our location, so chose this model after reviewing many others.  What IS it with the toast TIMER on ALL of these toaster ovens?  You have to WATCH each time you put toast in to keep it from burning.  No consistency of the timer dial. SO annoying, we decide to buy a TOASTER!!  And my husband BURNED his knuckles every time he removed toast from this oven, the door plate get SO HOT!  I wanted this toaster oven for toasting (a failure on that score) AND for heating small casseroles instead of using my larger wall oven.  So far, a baked potato has turned out well.  I will experiment with a few casseroles and update this review when I make a decision.

No electronic to mess this up which was the demise of my last oven. It is small and fits well in a small kitchen nicely.  I give it 4 stars because there is a couple of problems I had to remedy. First it does get hot if cooking for some time. The door handle does not get hot but the steel plate right behind it does and I burned my finger the first time on the burn out they recommend in their instructions.  I cut a small 1 1/18‚Äù X 9.75‚Äù thin board and lodge it between the handle latches. This fixed this.  The wire tray does not slide out when you open the glass door after toasting. I simple folded some tin foil and looped it around the wire tray. Just reach in grab the foil and slide it out.  Not sure why their engineers didn‚Äôt figure this out before production. If it wasn‚Äôt for these small problems it would have been a 5.

  The only downside to this is the timer. It should be a digital timer. It is very hard to set the dial timer to a setting that you dont need to monitor the food. You basically need to watch the food and remove when done. Timer dial settings are very small and close together. Other than that it works great.

  I had this toaster for less than a month (I ordered it July 12 and today is August 5th). First, it is ungodly hot when you're using it, like the entire thing heats up and the outside is extremely hot to the touch. But, it is an oven- so I could live with that. BUT THEN, last night I toasted half a bagel, buttered it up and walked away to enjoy it away from the kitchen and after a loud glass shattering noise, I realized the glass door shattered and redistributed itself ALL OVER MY KITCHEN!

  This toaster is great. I have one major problem. When it was assembled the wiring between the Broil/Bake mode got reversed. So basically... broil setting is actually bake(lower element turns on)  and Bake settings is actually Broil(upper element)  Normally I would have returned it, but I can remember to use the proper setting for now.

  I like the choice of top (broil), bottom (bake), or both (toast) heating elements.  Just make sure your dials are in the right place before you make toast. I like that it's very small and doesn't overwhelm the kitchen. It's great for making melted cheese sandwiches, warming up taco shells, and so much more. A loaf pan fits inside quite nicely, so I baked a quick bread, but the bottom burned. Fortunately the position of the racks can be changed, as well as the temperature, so I hope to do better next time. The down side is that the baking tray included warped upon first use. I found a 7 x 9 stainless steel pan with rack for a good price on this site that I hope will take care of my needs. I have been living with a 2 slice toaster for awhile, and I'm happy to have a toaster oven again. I use it every day and would recommend it for a single or couple. I would have given it 5 stars if it weren't for flimsy baking tray.

  In 35 years of owning toaster ovens, this is the worst design I have ever seen.The toast function doesn't work as such.  The ""light, medium, dark"" settings are so small and condensed and operate on such a short time that they are non-functional.  You must use it on timed settings, putting the heat to the highest level and then watch the toast.  Then you must manually reduce the time to turn it off.The ticking is annoying.The size accommodates 4 slices as advertised, but many other models actually fit 5 slices - not this one.There is mention in the manual about a removable crumb tray, but there is not one, so impossible to clean the crumbs on the bottom of the unit.The little tray for baking is flimsy.  The rack for toasting etc is also flimsy.We really tried to get used to this, but we cannot.  We are giving it away and purchasing a different model.

  For the life of me I cannot figure out how this toaster oven got so many good reviews. It doesn't cook/heat anything correctly, making it pretty useless.For toasting, the edges of the bread turn black before the center ever gets toasted - this occurs no matter where we place the bread on the rack.For cooking, the bottom of the items turn black and the top never cooks at all.For broiling, the pan provided warps before it ever gets to full broil temp. The edges of items burn before the rest finishes broiling.We purchased a toaster oven vs. a toaster so that my kids could make pizza on their own. The pizzas are small so heating up the large oven for a 6 or 7 minute cook time is silly. However, we currently have no choice as this appliance burns the crust to black while the cheese stays frozen. This occurs with the rack on the highest shelf.I cannot stress enough that you should avoid this appliance and go with anything else. A lot of money for a worthless object.

  I completely dislike this toaster oven but it was purchased based on high reviews.  I definitely would not recommend it to anyone else.  We only use it for toasting and it does not come close to evenly toasting of either bread or bagels and must be watched closely to avoid burning items.  So much heat generates from the outside of the oven that I am genuinely afraid to leave it in the cabinet where it is kept when in use. I have to move it to the counter and let it stay there until it cools down.  Instructions for care and use are sadly lacking. There have to be better appliances available.

  This works fine, even well as an oven. As is the case with most  toaster ovens ,(certainly ones at this price point)they don't work very well as toasters. The thing to be aware of with this particular toaster oven is that the controls are simple and not in a good way. One for temperature, one for mode, bake/ broil/toast and another one, a 'stay on' setting or a timer which is for toasting. You must make sure the temperature is turned up to its maximum setting when you want to toast, the  control doesn't do that automatically. I also had to put a broad rubber band on the toast/oven round switch because it was hard to turn because of its smooth surface. The bottom opens nicely for cleaning and getting rid of crumbs. Bottom line, oven works well, controls are poorly conceived . If you want a toaster this is not your best choice.

  I have many quibbles.- Unless I set the time at or past Dark, it'll just stop ticking before hitting Off.- It's hard to set the time consistently when turning the knob.- The Timer is LOUD and so is the ding (maybe some might prefer that).- It definitely heats the middle and bottom much quicker.Honestly, it's a slight step up from my pop up toaster and is pefectly compact for my counter, so I'm keeping it, but it's not a toaster I'd recommend. I keep hearing about how these things crap out or explode so I'll give it 3 stars for not doing that in the 3 months I've had it.

    High hopes for this toaster but it just wasn‚Äôt meant to be!
  
",1.0,Lauren C.,"Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  Today‚Äôs the day: after about five months I finally tossed this toaster oven. I‚Äôm someone who hates to waste money so believe me, it was hard. I should have returned it when I had a chance! Where to begin with my dissatisfaction? I should have known things wouldn‚Äôt bode well for me after it incinerated a few test cookies back in the summer. I chalked it up to having to learn a new toaster. After all, I had just parted ways with a trusty toaster oven that lasted approximately 12 years and had seen many a casserole in its time.I purchased this oven because I had a positive experience with the brand‚Äôs immersion blender (I use that thing at least 2x - week and it‚Äôs wonderful). So, I had high hopes for this toaster. Ugh... talk about a let down. The inside rack only has two settings - both of which are too high or too low to the heating elements. I‚Äôve managed to burn anything from cookies to hot dog buns and don‚Äôt get me started on my beautiful coffee cake that ended up blackened and beyond salvaging. It wasn‚Äôt in the oven for more than 30 minutes (AND I set the temp slightly lower than the recipe stated in order to account for any wonky heat happenings!) before I smelled the tell-tale smoke. What a shame.So yes, after half a year of giving this thing chance after chance, providing offerings to the culinary gods and hoping they‚Äôd spare my dessert... it‚Äôs gone. And no - there was no way I‚Äôd foist this thing on any unsuspecting friend or family member. The thing is a fire trap and I wouldn‚Äôt dare offer it to a person I cared about. It just can‚Äôt be trusted. Now, I‚Äôm in the market for a replacement. My last brand was an Oster and I‚Äôve seen a lovely one on here that should fit my needs so I‚Äôll likely return to that brand. You live and learn, I suppose!

    Toaster Issue
  
",3.0,lisac,"Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2019","









  
  
    
  To use the Toast function you have to use all 3 dials.  It requires you to pick an oven temperature for toast.  I've never had to do that on previous toaster ovens I've owned.  The writing for each function is very small so I had a hard time figuring out what setting I needed to be on.  Also, it would be nice if a tray or pan came with it other than just the grill rack.

  I got this as a gift for my mom. She wanted a mini oven to reheat or toast some pastries in the morning. It wouldn't make sense if she used a whole oven for one danish. My mom love the temperature control, it has a timer that will let you know when it's done. It's easy to use and clean, it's also compact as well. My mom was pretty happy with the results and how easy it was to use and clean. I would recommend this to college students who are living in dorms or people who wants to have compact gadgets. I think giving this as a gift to someone is also a good idea as well :)

  We purchased this product to essentially sit on our counter and supplement our gas oven.We ended up using it daily because it heats up much quicker than our main oven and does not cause the temperature in the kitchen to increase to what I can only imagine is the temperature of hell itself.Mainly used to: reheat frozen foods, reheat leftovers, bake side dishes/anything that required a different temp setting than whatever was in our main oven from hell, keep appetizers/dips warm on football Sundays, bake 2 tollhouse cookies at a time when we're exercising self-controlPros:-Heats up relatively quickly (although no ""preheat"" setting)-Distributes heat evenly-Great size - fits small-medium casserole dishes (think 1-3 servings)-Great price - $40 for something that endured daily use and lasted 8 months? Not too shabby-Can cook, bake and broil equally wellCons:-Mechanism/hinge that opens and closes the door in the bottom left corner popped out of place after about 8 months. It wasn't a huge deal initially as I was able to disassemble the entire thing and pop it back into place. Unfortunately less than one week later, it popped out again and I was unable to repair it-Max timer setting is 30 mins or ""always on""-Timer does not require oven to be plugged in to work (we unplug when not in use because I'm irrationally terrified of fires), which leads to the following scenarios:1) You set the function, temperature, and timer and walk away after hearing the timer begin to tick. You later return when timer dings to see nothing has actually cooked because the oven was unplugged;2) You have to forcibly turn the timer knob to the ""off"" position, which isn't that big of a deal except if you turn it even slightly too far past ""off"", you end up on ""always on"" and your boyfriend comes home to chicken that could be mistaken for boulders; and3) If you need to make chicken nuggets at 3am without waking up anyone in the house, you can't, because the timer dings no matter what-Difficult to determine what temperature setting you've actually turned on due to design of the knobs-Nearly impossible to clean-External oven gets extremely hot, including the door handle, after a few monthsSummary:I wish I had splurged for something nicer (admittedly my own fault - I got excited about a good deal) because for daily use, it won't last longer than 8 months.

  I am already searching for a better toaster oven after owning this one for 6 months.  I should have known at this price, it would not be the quality I would be happy with - toast burns, the baking pan is flimsy and became charcoaled after the second time I used it.  Very uneven baking and very uneven toasting.  It is also difficult to clean the bottom due to the position of the heating element.  It now looks MUCH older and worn than it should after only 6 months, as I have only used it about 3 times a week.  This is NOT the right choice!  Go for the Breville - I am.

  Purchased this toaster several weeks ago to replace an aging Black & Decker model. Decided on this model based on the brand reputation, as well as positive reviews. First of all, it is about the same size as my old toaster oven, but the inside is quite roomy. I can fit up to 4 pieces of regular sandwich bread inside. The toast function is what I mostly use, but I've also tried the oven a bit. Very pleased with the toast function, but the light to dark adjustment is very narrow and tricky to use. It does a nice bell ""ding"" after the timer expires, which I also like. The fit and finish is clean and modern (black, silver). Seems ""solid"", all-in-all. Very pleased with this purchase!

    I Returned This Toaster Oven. Here's Why!
  
",2.0,Elyse Decker ,"Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  I returned this toaster oven and I'll tell you why. First, the toasting control is a dial that you have to turn for every toast. The difference between light, medium, dark toast is about 1 millimeter. It is impossible to get an easy reproducible toast. You have to watch what you toast instead of just walking away and having the timer go off. On other toaster ovens I've set the toast level I want once and push a button for each toast. Second,  it takes forever to toast! Even at the highest temperature. Yes, you have to set the temperature of your toasting as well as darkness level with two separate dials. It also toasts unevenly. We had to position the rack very close to the top near the heating mechanism. Even with this positioning it would slowly melt Swiss cheese on top of a sandwich. If we positioned the rack too low, the bottom the bread would be burnt to a crisp and the top would be barely toasted. Thirdly, and this isn't the biggest deal, the heating mechanisms are the brightest I've ever seen in a toaster oven. Oddly, you'd think this would make them very hot and would toast quickly, but they don't! So you're standing there with this bright toaster oven thinking it's going to fry your bread to ash but nothing is happening! It is very annoying. We are toast people and I cannot recommend this toaster oven. I was actually surprised to see it as an Amazon's Choice product, I've always thought their recommendations were good.

  I cannot believe I paid $60 for this puny toaster oven. I sincerely thought it was going to be twice the size it is. It's not much bigger than your average sized toaster. It's not even large enough to comfortably put in four pieces of toast. What a waste of money. It claims it's an oven? You can't bake anything any normal size in there. It would have to be miniscule. Do not father to buy this item if you're going to use it other than putting one or two pieces of toast in it or bagel. In addition it does not work very well. Try to make frozen french fries.

  I must admit, we were enthusiastic when we read the reviews. A good deal for the price, we thought. And yet, this was the worst small appliance we have bought in a decade. Poor quality, let's start there. Within 5 months of regular use (made toast every few days, used toaster oven to cook things like chicken nuggets or to reheat leftovers), the hinge on the door literally snapped. That rendered the door unusable, unless we held it shut with another object leaning against it. Even prior to that, it was hard to clean (the bottom does not have a crumb pan that slid out, so you had to lift the whole thing and shake it into the garbage; shame on me for missing that detail). To get it hot enough to cook anything you need to dial it up to 400 degrees. We just threw it in a dumpster, and we could not be happier to be rid of it.

  I really wanted to like this toaster oven, based on all the reviews, but I use the toast feature most often and the light medium and dark settings just didn't work, so I've been forced to stand and watch it make toast so it doesn't burn. During my busy mornings, that doesn't work for me. I do like the oven features, but refuse to buy a toaster oven and a toaster. Kind of defeats the purpose of a toaster oven, toaster and oven all in one. If it doesn't make toast as well as the oven features, it shouldn't be labeled a toaster oven. Unfortunately I am returning it.

  Clean design, big window, doesn‚Äôt take up too much counter space. Toasts quickly and evenly.Only possible detriments are that the knob to set the toast is hard to turn/has a lot of resistance. Might be difficult for young/elderly. Bell to signify finished toast is also quite loud. Neither of these things are really negatives, just observations.

  If you want the double feature oven toaster this is great. It is a bit of a change if you are coming from a regular toaster since this will not 'harden' your toast as much as a regular toaster. However, it toast bread perfectly and you are able to cook a small piece of chicken or salmon in no time. If you are cooking for two and do not want to turn your stove's oven this is a great energy saver substitution.

    Inaccurate Temperatures
  
",2.0,Natalie,"Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2019","









  
  
    
  This toaster oven runs much, much too hot. I mostly use the ""bake"" function, and everything burns no matter which slot the rack is in. I think it's because the heating element never turns off during baking, and I've never had a toaster oven that worked that way. (The others I've had turn off the heating element from time to time to regulate temperature.) I've even turned down the dial a good 75 degrees and baked for less than half the prescribed time, and the bottom burned even though the food I was baking was still cold inside.The ""toast"" function is way too intense as well. The ""light"" setting really should be medium, and the ""medium"" should be dark. I don't dare to use the ""dark"" setting because I'm afraid of setting the oven on fire.I have not used the broiler.Two more complaints: the power cord is ridiculously short. It would only be an appropriate length if you have this on a countertop very near an outlet. Also, the rack has a big lip on it, so you have to tilt the baking sheet to get it onto the rack. This is super-inconvenient for something like corn dogs, which roll around when the sheet tilts. I've been able to adapt a bit using tongs, but you wouldn't be able to use those when heating something less structurally stable, like lasagna.Only giving this two stars because it does actually function, and it's easy to use.

  For performance and ease of operation this little gem is stellar.First time owning any version of a ""toaster oven"", but this really is so much more than a toaster oven.It is essential a mini counter oven. Our traditional gas stove's interior baking oven decided to go on the fritz.Both the broil and baking capacity stopped functioning. The hubs did the requisite You Tube search for DIY repairs; and started with the ones he was capable of. The obvious heating elements, but the fix was more complicated and would have required a costly repairman plus labor and parts. This in the dead of a New England winter with heating fuel bills!Since I broil and bake constantly for the household; Organic flax bread a staple, grilling veggies, broiling meats, I knew I could not go long without something.Starting researching these toaster convection ovens/ they seemed too good to be true.Finally decided on this guy in part because of the rotary knobs not electronic parts which tend to fail with heat.Also, the name Mueller means a lot. Wow what a good choice. totally exceeded my expectationsThe first test was to see if my baked goods would be any sort of palatable. Husband said the cake and bread wasmoister than the regular oven!! I think because of the shorter cook time, they don't dry out.Cinch to use. Have made everything in there and can't imagine now what I would do without it!Probably your need won't be as extreme as mine  ( LOL ! ) yet I can't say enough about the quality of this little ovenand at such a friendly price!

  Why this toaster oven does have a good amount of functionality for the price point, it's not fancy and won't be doing a bunch of crazy things besides baking, broiling, toasting, and keeping food warm, which are more than adequate. It takes longer than an actual oven to cook things in here since there isn't as much insulation as a larger oven but it's only a ten-minute difference which is negligible if you plan right.

  Toaster oven works great. However, I had a problem with the door latch. The company's truly helpful and professional customer service sent me another unit. If you buy the unir, I would recommend not opening the door when in operation. I believe the heat from the lower heating element has a negative impact on the door latch.

  This oven doesn't generate enough heat. I often roast vegetables in a toaster oven, and with my previous toaster oven the small cut veggies would take about ten minutes to cook, with this oven it takes a good 30 minutes. There are two baking elements --top and bottom--and only the bottom element heats up in baking mode, which may explain the low heat levelEven toasting a piece of bread takes an inordinate amount of time.I regret having purchased it.

Don‚Äôt care for the fact you have to guess how long to toast something. My old toaster has light med dark spread out rather than in one inch increment. So it‚Äôs hard to gauge how long to toast something. Also it only goes up to 30 mins timer. If you are using as an oven you can‚Äôt cook more than 30 mins.

  Never found that magical number to get the perfect toast. As a result we've had lots of burnt toast and fire alarms go off. Strangest thing is it toasts on the bottom, not the top, so 1/2 way in, you have to flip the bread. Crumbs fall through an open slot that doesn't sit right between the door and base, so you have to clean up after every use. Will never buy this again!

  Best features of this Toaster oven is the efficiency in bake/broil/toast mode. It cooks foods quickly, often in a shorter period that normally required. Very compact.

Design is solid and functional, with one minor niggle, the heat and timing knobs should have textured surfaces so that they are easier to grip securely.

    Two big negatives
  
",2.0,R. Muller,"Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  First negative is the ""crumb tray"" is not removable. It kind of spring loaded and you can't open it to clean unless you turn the oven on its back. That makes all the crumbs fall to the back of the oven and makes cleaning even harder. Plus you can't remove it to properly clean it in case you have drips that managed to make it to the ""crumb tray""Second negative is there is no drip tray. Most ovens of this type have a tray you can insert below the rack to catch drippings. Since this doesn't have that feature, anything that falls though the rack goes directly to your non removable ""crumb tray"".The oven is well made and will suit most uses but this is more like a miniature oven than a conventional toaster oven. While I like the oven, I'm afraid I'll use it less than a more conventional toaster oven with drip tray and removable crumb tray since this will not be easy cleaning for those times I use it for more than toast. Careful of the temps.  Put a oven thermometer in mine and with having it set for 400, It was actually at 500

My 11 yo is comfortable using unsupervised (and mom too) and can cook pizza, pizza rolls, burritos and burger patties from frozen without using the gas hog oven!The counter footprint is small enough to remain on the counter for days and attractive enough to stay without hiding away.

  This Mueller unit is very small and thinly constructed. This is my second such device formally I had an Oster which is made by Sunbeam. The Mueller looks and feels more like a toy that might have some utility warming rolls or melting cheese on a bun. It is not a serious cooking appliance. Tried baking a chicken breast and broiling some meat. Both tasks were disappointing .Can't imagine what there is about this gadget that people find pleasing other than  it was cheap. Perhaps it does a good job thawing or melting ice cubes.  At least my Oster was able to handle baking potatoes and meat dishes accurately and with little effort.  Isn't that the minimal requirement of a toaster oven. Amazingly I think that Amazon rates this their top seller. That says more about the American consumer than it does about Mueller.Going to toss this and probably spend a lot more money for something that belongs in a kitchen.

The most disappointing feature is the cleaning function for the crumb tray. the crumb tray is located on the outside bottom of the toaster and if you have large hands/fingers it is difficult to detach the crumb tray from the underside of the toaster and also to fit it back into the clip/slot that holds it into place without having to lift/tilt the toaster up onto it back edge, a very poor design. Caution should be used when using the toaster around children, the top of the toaster gets extremely hot and inattention by adult or curiosity by children could lead to severe burns as it appears that there is not insulating material between the inner and out metal skin of the toaster. There is no auto pull out feature for the door as on some toasters to remove the toast from the rack, the rack is so hot that you have to use a fork or tip of a knife to pull the tray out. Would I buy this toaster again, no ways even with a coupon for $10.00 of the regular price this toaster is no better overall than the $21.99 Black & Decker from Macys and its easier to return, I am not going to pack this up and return it, I will probably end up donating it to Goodwill for someone who really needs a toaster.

  Good oven, not much to it. It looks great in my kitchen and I save tons since I barely use my big oven. As a single guy, I barely cook but anytime I want to heat something up, I use it. The color is great as well and it is durable. Honestly my favorite thing to make is pizza, and I can get me a nice personal size pizza made in 20 minutes. Came with a few cool recopies that I will eventually get to.

  Once I learned how to convert oven instructions to toaster oven instructions, using the toaster oven became easy. It replaces me having to start up my oven for small things like reheating food. My whole family uses it now and we don‚Äôt heat up the whole kitchen just to warm up a slice a pizza. This beats microwaving which results in soggy food.

",1.0,Margaret Baptista,"Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  I unfortunately did not have the same experience as most  The dial to set toasting light to dark can only set to dark. If less than that, the timer and toaster shuts off after about a minute, So, since the only option is dark, I have to stand there to ensure the toast does not burn on the bottom. That's another problem. The bottom of the bread toasts much faster than the top. I lessened the problem a little by lowering the temperature But, it should toast evenly at the highest heat like all the toasters I've ever owned. Lastly, the crumb tray does not detach from the toaster making it difficult to clean. I think the only thing that was as promised was the footprint of the toaster.

  Little Powerhouse. I'm very please with this oven. Came well packaged, no dings, or scratches. It's been lest than a week since this arrived. I've bake chicken, a cake, and squash in this oven and everything turned out great. Be careful though. It heats up quickly, and coooks relatively fast. You have to either time whatever you're making, or monitor closely, else it will burn. This is a great addition to any kitchen. Easy cleanup, doesn't heat up the house, and doesn't require a large footprint. Thank you Mueller for a great product.

  So far I like the toaster. What I don‚Äôt care for, and why only 4 starts, is how long it takes to toast a piece of bread and how it‚Äôs still uneven. I ended up putting the rack on the top slot so the bread wouldn‚Äôt  burn. The dial is wrong as well as for toasting light, medium, or dark. I have to do past dark every time, even with the temp all the way up to 450 just for a normal toast. And it still takes almost 5 minutes just to toast a piece of bread.

  I previously had a Breville toaster oven.  It was a gift so when replacing it I didn't want to pay the price.  This toaster oven had great reviews.  The price seemed reasonable.  Everything about it felt ""cheap"".  Opening the door I could feel how lightweight it was.  In fact the whole unit is lightweight.  It only has one heating element on the bottom and one on the top. The bottom is a drop down door as opposed to a pull out tray which makes it more difficult to clean.  Most annoyingly the tic-tic-tic as it toasts.  When trying to cook a homemade pizza I put it on bake which only uses the bottom element.  I had to switch to toast and then use broil to help melt the cheese.  Toast seems to take longer than it should.  For the price I have bought Black and Decker toaster ovens.  Should have stayed with them. Overall disappointed.

  toast! Most toaster ovens dry out the bread some but they don't brown the bread, this one toasts it perfectly. I have had many toaster ovens that not only don't toast bread but you can't actually cook in them. So far I have tried: the ""bake"" mode on frozen French fries and oh my gosh they came out better than they ever have from my regular oven. I ""baked"" a slice of bread with butter and grated cheese on top that turned out nicely browned on top. The ""broil"" mode, cooked my food (a pork chop) and (salmon fillet) thoroughly, however the food did not brown on the top as I had hoped it would, though each meal was perfectly delicious. It is also very good looking on my counter. I sent an e-mail to customer support for the manufacturer Mueller and they answered my question the same day I asked. I had been worried that I didn't know the name of the manufacturer when I ordered this UltraTemp Toaster Oven, but I am now very happy I bought this lovely piece of equipment!

You need a rack to put the drip pan on and on the lower rack setting. Food goes on an upper rack at least that's how I like to broil.

  This toaster oven is small, but mighty, cooks faster then your oven so you need to keep an eye out. I roasted a cut up chicken and it came out really good. Toasts bread, bagals and English muffins evenly. Easy to clean, with a pull out tray. This is a sturdy unit that does not take up a large amount of space on your counter. Great for heating up leftovers and avoiding using the oven. I love this little powerhouse?

",1.0,Sara,"Reviewed in the United States October 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  It more or less works fine. I have basically used it to toast bread, naans, and bagels. I do not have any issues with its functioning, it works fine as a regular toaster oven.My biggest issue is with the way this has been constructed! I have cut my fingers badly while trying to clean it. It has such sharp edges inside that if we are not watchful we can really hurt ourselves. I am now so wary of cleaning it that I keep postponing the job!! And I do know that if I am not cleaning it regularly I will not keep it for long!UPDATED: Taking off another star from the rating.I have been using it for the past 6 months now and do not like it at all. Due to the cuts I got trying to clean it I have almost given up on deep cleaning the oven and as a result, it is becoming an eye-sore! This might be the one purchase I greatly regret!

  I am usually only cooking for myself and using my oven is a pain, so I decided to purchase this toaster oven for my small, individual meals. So far, it has worked amazingly. All of my meals come out tasting like it was cooked in a real oven whether it is pizza or chicken. It fits perfectly in my kitchen and isn't too bulky, but powerful enough to heat up my food in an efficient manner.

    A few caveats about this product
  
",3.0,customer,"Reviewed in the United States April 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  This oven is clean, compact, and functional. I like it. But there are a few caveats customers should know about:1. I couldn't find anything in the description that indicated the type of heating elements used by this oven or that they were near-IR Infrared heaters. That information is disclosed in the Warnings section of the manual. There they advise you not to look at the heater elements directly for extended periods of time... because of possible eye damage. So, I went to the Internet to learn more.I found mixed reports online regarding the possible hazards of near IR Infrared spectrum exposure to your eyes. Some say it's a non-issue. Others say this wavelength penetrates all the way to your retina, and you should protect your eyes when operating a near-IR heater. I think someone should have identified the heater element type in the description of this device on AMZN. Warning you about it after you buy the product seems like a violation of some sort of full-disclosure rule somewhere. Since this lightweight oven is not nearly as well-insulated as a 6 cu ft conventional oven, the burners are ON almost continually. It's hard NOT to look at them while the oven is operating.2. I see in two or more places that this Mueller company is based in Austria. Good for them! I like Austria. I would like to visit there someday. But the packaging materials for the oven inform you that this product is sold in California and manufactured in PRC. Hmmm. I wonder if it has anything to do with Austria at all!3. I tried to use it once at 400 degrees and burned my entree. The oven is compact and the heater elements are very close to the dish you fit inside it; and as I said, they are ON almost continually. Perhaps I should try again at a lower temperature.  But...That was strike three. I sent it back.

  Have had the Mueller less than 1 1/2 yrs & absolutely loved it. However, started having problems with the door when it was less than 1 yr old. It was slightly ajar when cooking. Today the door hinge just fell apart & it‚Äôs no longer useable. It‚Äôs very disappointing considering my last one (a different brand), lasted close to 10 yrs. I rarely used this Mueller (less than 1 x week) & expected it to last at least a couple of years. It‚Äôs really not worth the $ when there are cheaper brands out there that don‚Äôt fall apart so easily.

    Crumb Tray is Not Removable. That's a Deal-Breaker.
  
",3.0,Bill,"Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  I can't stand having old food sitting at the bottom of my toaster oven. My old Black and Decker toaster oven had a removable crumb tray. Just slide it out, empty it in the trashcan and/or scrub in the sink, then (when dry), slide back in. I don't know how a modern toaster oven can be designed without this feature/convenience, but this Mueller oven is. It is so frustrating to have this simple feature be over-looked, that I had to return these (I bought 2).My beef with the crumb tray is that it is not removable. From the owners manual:""How to Clean the Crumb Tray. 1) Turn the oven on it's back. 2) Push the crumb tray knob down and then pull it. 3) clean the crumb tray. 4) After cleaning, return the Crumb Tray in it's place.""The first step alone (turn it on it's back!) just makes me wonder why this was designed this way as that makes cleaning it so inconvenient.And we all know that our kids will make a pizza or burrito in the oven from time to time which means cheese and other ingredients that are going to leak and burn onto the crumb tray. Imagine not being able to easily clean that up.It's hard to speak to the other features because for me the crumb tray issue is so big, but in fairness, the unit looks nice. Wife made a small pizza in it and it cooked fast. Some toast or a bagel, however, was not evenly cooked (top or bottom cooked significantly more).It is very light weight, which makes it feel cheap. But I think most toaster ovens around this price point are probably light in weight.As others have mentioned, the controls are quite stiff so someone with aching joints might have a problem operating it. Maybe they will soften up with use but initially they are pretty hard to turn.I saw the dimensions in some other reviews and noticed some variance, so here's what I get with my trusty tape measure. The dimensions are (roughly) 14 3/4"" W x 9"" H x 9""D (not including the handle on front). It is a little smaller than what we thought it would be.One final note: Something that piqued my interest was that this company is Mueller of Austria. They go out of their way to include ""of Austria"" in the logo and my impression was that this unit may be manufactured in Austria and to me, for whatever reason, that inferred quality and precision. I should have known better, but upon checking the box, and it was no surprise, but it is manufactured in China. And by the way, as I guess nowadays people are paying more attention to country of origin, they state ""Made in PRC"" (Peoples Republic of China), I guess to try to trick anyone that doesn't know what ""PRC"" stands for and might be averse to buying product made in China. I'm not accusing Mueller of false advertising, but it's just a tad bit shady, and I don't like that.I think if a few improvements are made, this oven could move up a notch or two, but for now they are going back and I will continue shopping.

  As both an experiment and an effort to make more cookies for a bake sale at school, I figured I'd use this toaster oven to bake some cookies while the large oven was being taken up by another batch. It didn't disappoint in the process and got out some very good looking and crisp cookies. So, whenever I need to use the oven to a small extent, I'm going to instead opt for this toaster oven. That way, I save on gas and have an easier time handling everything.

  I was replacing my old toaster oven with this Mueller model because it was on sale.  The directions gave it many restrictions, such as not operating on the same circuit with another appliance  , not placing anything on top and  keeping it several inches away from the wall. After first use, I can see why. It gets extremely hot on the outside. You could very easily get burned. If you decide to place something on top anyway, it will probably melt or stop working if it‚Äôs another appliance.  The function settings are written so tiny and light that they are hard to see with the bare eye. Other than that, I guess it does the job. Although I regret purchasing this.Im writing an update approximately  1 and 1/2 weeks after using my toaster oven. I upgraded the review to 4 stars from 3 to reflect my excellent customer service experience. ( I didn't know how to write a new review without changing the original, unless someone would like to explain how to do an update ). After I received the unit , I was trying to figure out where he crumb tray was located. I sent an email to the seller and someone got back with me the very next day with an answer. Then after posting my first review, I got a message from the seller informing me that my unit was defective, and they sent me a new unit. I just received it in the mail today and will update to 5 stars if it performs better than the first.After using the replacement for almost two months, I must admit that this toaster oven does a poor job. The replacement performs exactly the same as the original. In addition, it smokes profusely if cooking on a high setting. I‚Äôd really rather not use this toaster oven. I‚Äôd rather just use my large oven for baking and broiling and my regular toaster for making toast. This toaster oven has proven ( for me), to be pretty useless. I do regret purchasing it. I really don‚Äôt care about having gotten a replacement because it simply does not perform any better than the original.  It looks great on the counter but is not worth purchasing.

I noticed this brand, Mueller, and read the reviews on it.  Most people seemed to be very happy with their purchase. I thought about it for a while and decided the price was good and it was made in AUSTRIA. So, I bought it. When it arrived , I was a surprised how much smaller it was than my Kitchenaid.

  This is a very compact toaster oven so it won't take up a huge amount of space. I purchased it to reheat  smaller meal-size portions of food that I plan to  pre-cook to last say a week(for one person). So far I have just cooked 3 small  pizzas in it.  I cut a 12 in. frozen pizza in half and about 1/2 pizza fits diagonally in the pan provided. It has an adjustable timer so you can tweak the cooking time as needed(vs a preset digital). I undercooked my pizzas the first couple of times(did not read directions). Anyway all three pizzas ultimately came out perfect. The heat seems to be equally distributed as I didn't burn the crust and the cheese came out slightly browned. I feel this is a much better alternative to a microwave. A tuna melt sandwich is next on my list, which I am sure will turn out great!  Take measurements to make sure a smaller-size oven meets your needs. I feel this is a high quality product that will last a long-time.

  This is an okay toaster over, however the timer knob is impossible to turn if your hands are the slightest bit damp or wet. The knobs are perfectly round and very smooth... making impossible to adjust, or turn off the timer knob which has more turning resistance than the other knobs.

  I‚Äôm editing this review I posted a few weeks ago because the Seller took the time to write a lengthy reply (without me even contacting them) asking what they could do to satisfy me or make me happy. That is worth 4 stars right there!!! I am still disappointed that it wasn‚Äôt Made in Austria rather it was Made in China, but this is more of a systematic problem with Amazon (for burying the country of origin) and is not particularly the fact of the seller here. . Side note: AMAZON: PLease hear us and add a filter button for country of origin!!!!! It is impossible to read where an item is made because that information is purposely buried in the description or simply not there. Anyway, the product quality may be whatever, but this seller does care about its customers, so they get my endorsement.

  The rack or grate does not fit snugly into the grooves and will collapse when used in the bottom position.  The knobs are slick and round, and if your fingers are wet or oily, it's hard to get enough traction to turn them.  The toasting degree indicator is unreliable; you have to keep an eye on the toast and keep adjusting.  I go through a lot of toaster ovens.  I think I'll go back to Black & Decker.

  I'm sure some might be fine with this toaster oven, but there were a few things I did not like and I returned it.  1) the timer dial needs to be turned past a certain point and then dialed back. The turn back was VERY stiff and difficult to have it land where I wanted.  2) there are single elements on top and bottom. Toast is literally striped. 3) the door does not hook  the rack to draw it forward when opening 4) the crumb drawer is only assessable if the unit is turned on it's back and is not removable 5) the bake pan appears to have a finish that is not easily cleaned.

  Now that I have had and used this product for over 6 months, I can leave a review. I purchased this for quick and efficient cooking without having to use the oven. I can say that it does deliver as marketed. This appliance is very durable. However, I will say that the only issue experienced with this device is that it did catch fire from the internal heating elements after about 4 months of use. Luckily someone was around when this happened so the house did not burn down. I am rating this product 5 stars because of the excellent customer service I received after informing the company of what happened. They were very empathetic and apologized for their product's fire hazard. They quickly sent me another brand new toaster oven within a week without hesitation and I did not have to return the old one. I say all that to say this, any cooking appliance has the potential to have issues and or catch fire which is the reason all appliances should be monitored to ensure safety. Having invaluable customer service matters a great deal to me. I recommend this product because of the durability, usability, efficiency and most important the high level of customer service. I have not had any issues with the heating element in the last3 months.

Was hoping Europe as it‚Äôs an Austrian company. Alas, no. So, had to gas off the stinky components for awhile. Perfect size for use. Holds four standard bread slices horizontally. Does well with most frozens, like tater tots and such, but English muffins are slow to cook and get dried out in middle (crunchy instead of chewy), even though not very brown on outsides. Need a good slot toaster for them! Draws standard 1200+ watts so can easily trip sensitive 15amp cb if using at same time as microwave or elec kettle. Oh well...

  Great price and functionality! The Mueller MT-175 Toaster Oven has easily become one of my go-to kitchen appliances. It is stainless steel and is not unnecessarily bulky, which makes it ideal for homes or apartments with limited counter space (see photo for visual reference). In fact, it is smaller then the package dimensions annotated in the product info section, measuring approx. 9"" x 14 3/4"" x 9 1/4"" (H, W, D).  It is also ideal, if you do not have dual-ovens and need to cook a couple dishes simultaneously.Additionally, it is simple to use, easy to clean and heats up quickly! The oven has three turn knobs - Temp, Function and Time (top to bottom). The temperature setting ranges from 150-degrees F/ 65-degrees C to 450-degrees F/ 230-degrees C. The function knob consists of Bake, Broil and Toast settings. You can keep food warm by manually adjusting the temperature and time, but it is not an inherent/ stand-alone function. Lastly the timer setting ranges from 5 to 30-minutes with markings for each minute as well as toasting preferences - light, medium or dark.So far, I have toasted English muffins and sliced bread and have baked quinoa-breaded chicken nuggets to perfection! Moreover, I am looking forward to making some of the quick and simple dishes (e.g. Baked Garlic Cheese Grits and Green Chile and Apple Pork Roast) featured in the complementary recipe booklet. Bon appetit!

I am updating my star rating due to the Seller reaching out.  These days it seems very few companies do little to support their customers.  While I did not re purchase this item, I would definitely consider buying other items from them.

  Was looking to replace a larger Black & Decker convection style toaster oven that had been slowing down as the elements aged. The European design and smaller footprint of this toaster oven appealed to me and I'm pleased with the performance.Like any toaster oven, I primarily view it as a toaster and then  occasionally use the oven settings for reheating single slices of pizza or cooked vegetables like Brussels. The toasting is even and paced in a way that works for the interior and exterior of the bread, and reheats of pizza are simple.My previous toaster oven had a plastic piece at the top of the glass that protected fingers from heat when opening and closing the door and the Mueller gets pretty hot to the touch in that area, so I've had to adjust to opening and closing the door exclusively with handle. No big deal and I prefer the stainless look over plastic.

    Serious Design Flaws
  
",1.0,T. Leland,"Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  Several things about this oven are problematic.  First, several surfaces including the top and door get extremely hot during operation to the point that they will severely burn your hand if touched directly.  Second, the timer is an egg timer so it is very approximate.  Finally, the crumb tray cannot be removed without flipping the whole unit on its back to unlatch the bottom.  I do not recommend this unit especially because of the first point which makes it extremely dangerous to operate.

  I have never owned a toaster oven and thought this would help with energy costs this winter.  I used to cook for a living and thought this toaster oven would take forever to warm up, but it is fast!  I also liked the cook book that is included.  The few things that annoy me is first off, the timer makes a loud clicking noise until it goes off, like an old alarm clock.  The other thing is the crumb tray is hard to remove, it doesn't just slide out.  No big deal though.  I highly recommend this toaster oven.  It looks nice on my counter.

  Recently, our toaster 'died' and so my wife and I decided a toaster/oven would be a better replacement choice. We purchased the Mueller oven on the strength of reviews since we hadn't  used a toaster/oven before. Very quickly we realized the following: Heat dispersion was uneven so toast became overdone at the edges and underdone in the center. Insulation is poor so the unit gets very hot although the manufacturer does state heat precautions in the documentation. Baking attempts were a disaster due to the direct radiated heat  which burned anything in contact with the tray. We have now decided to purchase a higher quality unit that will meet expectations having learned a classic lesson; you get what you pay for.

Most items list the Item Dimension and not package; recommend adding the Item dimensions somewhere in the ad - inside and outside for those with counter space restrictions.Needless to say it's going back - maybe the unit is great but too small for my our needs.

",4.0,DB,"Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2021","









  
  
    
  We have had this toaster for about two months now after our old one broke. Overall, we are very happy with it. It's very good looking and takes up a lot less space than our old toaster. It's very affordable and we've also found that the heat distribution is way better and more even than our older, more expensive toaster. So even though this one is cheaper, in a lot of ways it seems like an upgrade.The only negative thing we've noticed (and maybe we just haven't figured it out yet) is there doesn't seem to be a way to manually turn the timer to shut it off early. Frequently we'll put something in and set the toaster to some amount of time. With our old toaster, if we noticed that the bread/buns/whatever looked good and pulled them out early, we could also manually move the timer dial to zero to turn it off. On this model, the timer dial seems to not allow this - you just have to wait for it to finish. You can turn another dial to Off to turn off the heating element and save energy that way but you still have the ""ding"" some number of minutes later since the timer is still going. It's a minor thing and this toaster is still totally worth it, but I wish they would update that.

    A Nifty Little Toaster Oven
  
",4.0,Edward Marcus,"Reviewed in the United States July 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  So far I've used this oven only for baking potatoes and toasting bread and bagels. The toasting function works well, turning out evenly browned bread, once you learn how to set the timing and position the bread in the oven. (It seems there are only two positions for the rack, but this becomes four if you turn the rack upside down.) This involves turning the heat control to the maximum setting, deciding whether you want to brown both sides or only the top (by activating both elements or only the top one). Adjusting the timer for toasting is a skill acquired through practice, as the gradations are narrow, requiring good eyesight and some practice. (Be prepared to scrape some pieces of over-toasted bread at the sink until you learn.) By the way, the timer runs only 30 minutes, so the ""stay on"" setting is well conceived and essential for foods requiring long cook times. But you'll need a supplemental timer; I use the timer on my microwave oven.The temperature control on the unit I have is ridiculously out of whack. After burning the skin on a couple of russet potatoes to a crisp, I used an oven thermometer to learn the truth. It turned out that on my machine the setting for 400 degrees F. is 290 degrees! Now that I know this, I can bake russet potatoes perfectly. But by any standards this must be considered a major defect. On the plus side, the oven is small, so its 1100 watt power is entirely adequate.This machine, compared with other toaster ovens I've owned, has the footprint of a postage stamp. The tiny amount of space it takes up on the countertop is one of its most attractive features. Additionally, the machine, by my taste, has a very attractive design, and it is made of sturdy materials, given its modest price. It seems well constructed as well.I've grown fond of the little bugger, my affection enhanced by the challenge of learning to use it, which definitely takes some experimentation and a touch of ingenuity. But if you're short on time and mechanically deficient, forget this demanding little beauty.

  I have had toaster ovens for many years.  I basically just use the bake setting, since these ovens rarely toast well.This is no exception.The construction of this toaster oven could be better.  The door is a bit off, which I did not notice immediately. The exterior which is supposed to be stainless steel does not appear to be that. After being wiped a couple of times it already looks old. And it absolutely does not toast well.  I doubt I will have this oven very long, since I think eventually  the hinge on the door will break. I would not recommend this item.

",1.0,Brendan,"Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've been using this for about 6 months now.  This toaster comes with a broken timer that stops around the light/med setting with no sound it just shuts off.  So you have to set it past dark, but then sometimes it gets stuck on for too long.  If I mess with the knob I can sometimes get it to ding by slowly turning back to wear is should be naturally stopping, but even doing it manually it is very finicky.  All this means I basically have to watch the toasting process the whole time or the food may get burned because the timer is so unreliable and useless.The grill comes with a big lip, so removing items from the grill is very dangerous and awkward.  Even if you never burn your self trying to get your items over the lip, your food will certainly lose integrity and crumble into the bottom as it scrapes over the lip.  The grill also slides out very easily while you are removing food, but does not go back in very easily, which means it is much more likely the burning hot grill will come sliding out and cause burns or an accident.This product will still toast your food, but the price is not appropriate for something so shoddy and unsafe.  There is no attention to detail or safety.  Very poor quality.  Produced from a place completely absent of pride or integrity.  Do not pay this much money for one of these.

A lot of heat is lost through the glass door, and some from the sides/top, due to what I assume is insufficient glass insulation. Because of this, things don't cook as quickly as they normally would in a higher quality toaster oven. As a result, cook times are typically 1.5 times longer than normal.All in all, it's solidly built and does the job well, the poor insulation just means it heats up the area around it pretty well, and takes a little longer to cook items. If you're looking for something affordable with lots of functions, this is a solid buy. If you're concerned about heat, you may want to consider spending more on something better insulated.

  After only having it for about 2 years, my last mini toaster died and I needed a more reliable replacement. So far this has been an amazing replacement. Works great and heats up food in a jiffy. I can heat up just about anything, which is convenient since I hate using the microwave. I actually use it to heat up my personal frozen pizza better than the regular oven. It is so much easier and I love it!!

  I was excited to obtain this toaster as it was the right color and price point for what I will want to do with it, which is mostly toast.  it seems that my family and I go through a toaster oven every few years and because of that, we didn't want to spend a lot.  I like the simplicity of this model as well as its size- it fits nicely on our countertop and won't collect crumbs all over the place like ordinary toasters do.  it's important, I suppose, to make sure that you follow their directions before you use it for the first time- I have done that and all was easy to touch and use- timer, toast and it clearly conducted heat from both top and bottom coils. I am excited to use this toaster oven and if anything changes, I will certainly post.

  This toaster oven had only one element across the top in the middle and only one across the bottom in the middle.  Wonder how it could toast or bake at the very front or back of the oven.  The broiler/baking tray did not have deep enough grooves for the juices to drain away when broiling which then required that the meat would have to lay in the raw meat juices when the cooked side was turned down to cook the other side.  The tray was not wide enough to fit in the slots at the sides of the oven.  It had to set on the wire rack otherwise the meat could have laid on the rack and dripped down into the broiling pan.

  It‚Äôs the right size for our kitchen counter in that it holds 4 pieces of toast. Many toasters advertise themselves now as countertop pizza ovens and list the diameter of pizza they will hold. We use this for toast and reheating leftover food. I feared that the single heating element on top and bottom would burn the toast in the center and leave it barely crisp on the edges but I was happy to see that even 4 slices of bread come out very evenly toasted when the rack is in the center position. We love this Mueller toaster and are glad Amazon recommended it due to its high number of 4 and 5 star reviews!

Wouldn't try to really cook  or bake in it, but it's good for toast, or keeping things warm.  The price was good, it looks nice  and it seems well made.  It must have very little insulation, for it puts out quite a bit of heat when in use. East to clean, but care must be taken, for there's a razor-sharp edge along the body  just inside the door.

  This is an unconventional toaster oven which proves that good looks aren't everything. The first time I tried to make toast was an utter failure. I put the bread in, turned the toast knob to medium. Ticking began and shortly after the bell rang and I withdrew the same piece of bread, completely untoasted. When all else fails ""read the directions."" From the directions I learned that you have to first set the temperature to get the oven to light; why it was necessary to design it this way I don't know. So turn the temp up high and then set the toast knob to the desired darkness. This works but it takes a few times to get the settings just right, at which point the toaster produces a nice piece of toast. It would have been good to have the toaster rack automatically slide out when you open the door. This was a feature of our old Cuisinart toaster oven and it made it easier to withdraw the toast without also toasting your hand. I haven't use the oven for anything else but toasting to this point.

It was a good little toaster oven while it lasted, but it really should have lasted longer. I chose it initially because I had a very specific spot I wanted to put it in, so space was limited.

It is pretty small but we mostly use it for simple stuff like toast and other breads. I sometimes use it to bake cookies when I don't feel like heating up the oven. The size is fine for our needs. I do line the cookie sheet it came with, with aluminum foil. Note that it's not a non stick sheet. I would invest in some extra pans, small, 9in or less pans and sheets. You can find them anywhere.

  Heating up yesterday's pizza in the toaster oven is the best. I hate how the microwave makes everything soggy, this oven makes pizza taste even better the next day.

  I got this a while back ago. I am just now doing the review because I wanted to use it for a while so my review actually count for something. Is being a while over 3 months and the whole time this toaster oven has been great. Is very practical, easy to clean and it fits just fine on my kitchen counter. I recommend it, is a great oven.

    CAUGHT ON FIRE

  Thank goodness everyone was okay but the toast legit caught on fire on the inside. There were 3 flames ‚Äî HUGE for a toaster oven this size. Luckily I bought A fire extinguisher when I first Moved into the house (thank you, amazon Prime) a few months ago and that I‚Äôve had training in using it.NOTHING else was burned inside of the toaster. The food was still frozen from the freezer. It‚Äôs brand new so it was clean and had no grime in it.Didn‚Äôt think to snap a photo of the fire (cause obviously it‚Äôs a hazard) but my furbo managed to take a small video.

    Makes good toast! Oven heats quickly
  
",5.0,scott,"Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  A 'toaster/oven' is a compromise. Some make good toast but the oven is too small or underpowered. Some ovens work great but toasting is an afterthought. This model seems a good compromise between both. You have complete control over temperature, which elements heat and the time. I was a little unsure with only a lower and upper heating element that toasting would work, but it does. The dark setting on toast most definitely is what it says. Oven wise I can fit a much larger pan than I am used to and so we now use the main oven less for reheating.Cons:* Pay attention to the manual and how to use the timer properly* Smells even after the 15 minutes they say to let it burn-off. After a week I can no longer detect the acrid smell of whatever it is.

  This is an update to an earlier review.  The oven that was originally delivered to us was defective -- the handle on the door got very hot.  We posted a review about the heat hazard.  The seller reached out to us several weeks ago months after the purchase.  The end result was they sent us a newer model.This updated version of the toaster oven is a great! No more hot handle. It's a pleasure to use.  It's easy to read the lettering on the control knobs.  It functions just like it should and we're happy to have it in our kitchen -- we are using it every day!

  Right off the bat, it overall feels a litter cheaper than the toaster I‚Äôm replacing. A feature on my old toaster that is not on this one was the door hooked onto the inside rack so when you opened it, it pulled out the rack. With this one, I‚Äôve got to get something to pull out the tray and I know I‚Äôm going to burn myself. The choices of toasting light, medium or dark are so close to each other, I can‚Äôt distinguish between them with the giant knob. I ended up just putting it into stay on mode and monitored it for when my bagel was done. I‚Äôd prefer a clear setting so I can walk away and finish the other meal prep. So I will probably have burnt bagels in my future. It‚Äôs probably better to buy a toaster that you personally have used at someone‚Äôs house.  If I could easily return this, I would but it would be a huge hassle.

  The control knobs of this toaster oven are easy enough to set to what you want and the timer's ticking isn't loud enough to bother you. It shuts off when it's set to. The material is stainless except for the sides which do make it a little less stylish but it's not a deal-breaker and they did have to make some concessions in an effort to add other more useful features like convection and four different cooking modes.

    DOOR FELL OFF, POOR QUALITY
  
",1.0,AJ,"Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had high hopes for this toaster oven, it looks very nice and doesn't take up a lot of space on the counter. The first few times I used it, it worked well, although it took forever to toast anything. Then it began burning things. It would take 10 minutes for toast to even turn slightly tan and then suddenly the toast would literally be burnt to a crisp. This happened every time I used the toast setting so I started using the bake setting to toast bread, which worked for awhile but then it started incinerating the toast on one side only. Then today the door fell off. There's a little hinge that the door fits into and I tried slipping back into place but it keeps popping out, so now the toaster is useless. Very disappointed in this toaster oven and I would not recommend it.

",4.0,B. Feder,"Reviewed in the United States October 2, 2018","









  
  
    
  UPDATED REVIEW:Seller contacted me and apologized that I had received a defective unit.  They asked if it would be ok to send me a replacement unit for free.  New toaster arrived and does indeed shut off when the timer is up.  I have only used it for toast, and it takes a little getting used to to determine the setting for light vs. medium vs. dark.  They are fairly close on the dial, and it's not easy to get it very precise.  Also the unit does get a little bit warm on the outside.  That said, it's a good little toaster oven if like me you don't want to have to encounter a mainframe computer to make your toast!  And the customer service is definitely 5 stars!The very first time I used this it was to toast bread.  I even read the instructions first!  Alas, the timer was set to medium, and it never turned itself off.  When finished ""ticking"" it just stayed on until I smelled the charcoaled toast and turned it off manually before a fire could begin.  As a test (and because I wanted my toast), I tried a 2nd time.  I did the very same thing, this time it turned off.  I proceeded to test it several more times, both moving the dial past the toast settings and not.  It failed 2 more times (out of 7), and there was no pattern.

  We love our little toaster oven. We use it everyday for toast, heating up small about of food etc. My kids make grill cheese sandwiches and for the price you can't beat it. We don't need anything fancy but something functional which this toaster is. There isn't a crumb tray so I need to carefully hold it up to clean crumbs but I don't mind.

  This toaster literally burns everything cursed enough to be put inside it. It‚Äôs vindictive and cruel.You can‚Äôt pull out the bottom to clean it, so it‚Äôs just permanently a graveyard of meals past that haunt you by burning everything else. The temperature gauge is possessed and never agrees with whatever the package says.To top that, the door mechanism broke less than six months later, so now I need a new, less psychotic toaster. I am not a beast. I do not have anger issues. I was cooking vegan turkey and went to gently close the door and it burst open with the rage of a thousand demons and remained open like the hellmouth that it is. Where is Buffy Summers when you really need her?A list of things that this toaster burns:- cookies- dreams- vegan meat- futures- potatoes- literally every one of my fingers because the doorway is attached to the flames from hell and will burn your nails off. Let alone that one time when the top bar spit viscous vitriol at me and The blister was so terrifying that it deserves its own Scary Stories To Tell In The Dark story.I hate this toaster more than I‚Äôve ever hated a human being.

    Big Regret

  Save your money and buy something else. I bought this to replace a Cuisinart toaster oven that I had for many years, and I was impressed by all the good reviews and ratings this one had. I do not understand what the good ratings are for. Basically, this toaster oven fails on every measure.1. Difficult to reliably toast. To toast, you have to set the temperature and then turn a timer dial to toast for a certain amount of time. But the dial is not very accurate, especially for shorter amounts of time like 10 minutes and under, so you never really know how toasted your bread will be. You have to stand around and watch it. Who has time for that?2. Uneven heating. The heating element is in the middle of the toaster oven, and your items will be toasted in the middle and raw on the sides. Major fail.3. Burn risk. The door is glass and there is a little metal bar handle that stays cool. However, when you open the toaster, the bar rests on the counter and you instinctively touch the glass the close the door. But the glass is hot! We had several burnt fingertips before we learned to carefully reach down and try to close the door without touching the door. Not very intuitive.4. A Big Mess. There is a little gap between the bottom of the toaster oven and the door, so every time you make toast the crumbs will fall through it and make a mess on your counter. Giant pain.5. Hard to clean. I bought this hoping it would be easier to clean than the Cuisinart was. I was wrong. The bottom has a latch, but stays attached to the toaster. So when you need to clean the crumbs out, you have to hold the entire thing over your sink or garbage can and unlatch/wash the bottom.6. Small. This is noticeably smaller than the Cuisinart. I thought I wouldn't mind, but it's just one more thing.Now that we've used it several times and threw out the boxes, I don't feel like I can return it. But I am regretting buying it big time.

    Can't cook for low times
  
",2.0,Ed,"Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2021","









  
  
    
  I bought this hoping for a quick ""flash-toast"" of bread and bagels. Problem is, though the timer will turn to a low time (and it's even marked to indicate this is a quick time) it will not start working until you turn it faster. I could not get a 10 second flash toast, or even a 20 second flash toast. Best I could get was for one minute (I think, I didn't stand there with a timer) and by that time my bread was way more toasted than I wanted. So either I open the oven while it's hot or I manually turn the timer knob back to zero. It clearly resisted turning back to zero while on, and after a few weeks of that it broke. The heat won't come on at all now. I had hoped I didn't need a digital one, but if you're looking to quick toast your items very quickly, look elsewhere. It's probably fine for people looking to toast for several minutes though (when you will turn the knob past the time where it will activate the oven)

    Decent toaster oven and looks good
  
",4.0,Bill,"Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  It's a good looking toaster oven and I have no complaints on how well it cooks. My only complaint is that if you're done coming and want to turn the timer off, it's very, very, difficult.  My girlfriend can't do it and I have a very tough time. You can still turn off the heating using the other knobs but you'll still hear the ticking until the bell rings. The instructions say to turn it slightly clockwise before trying to turn it counterclockwise but I don't notice a difference.  Based on all the other reviews I've read on toaster ovens, it seems there is a lot of opportunity for someone to make a better one.

  This toaster oven is not good for people who are getting old and having vision problems. I couldn‚Äôt see the baking temperature without turning all the lights on in the kitchen and putting on my reading glasses. The thin black lettering on the stainless steel is probably inadequate for anyone over 20! Even after thinking I‚Äôd conquered the temperature I burnt the only thing I tried to bake in it.

  I have only used this about 6 times now and the door hinge that keeps the door closed, pulls it shut, is malfunctioning. The overall appearance and simplicity is nice, but on bake, when doing brown n serve rolls, the bottoms burn before the tops brown, so the heat distribution must not be proper. I like the size but am disappointed with the door hinge and heating distribution.

  I've only used this a couple of times so far, but I'm pleased with it. I'd never heard of the brand, but I was looking for a small, inexpensive countertop oven and finally decided to give this one a try. I was tired of firing up the range oven for every little cooking job and heating up the apartment - especially in the summer heat with the A/C already struggling to keep up. It arrived in good shape and has done a great job so far. It even came with a little recipe book and some of the recipes look pretty good - I'm not much of a cook but I might even try a few of them.

  Update: You really can't bake with this toaster oven. Burns on the bottom and cooks unevenly. I think I will try much lower temperature settings to see if this helps this problem. That said, the oven heats up quickly and when you are in a rush it is great to heat things fast.My previous review: I have never owned a toaster oven before, but have used many over the years. Small on the counter top but roomy inside. Easy to figure out. Nice design. Heats up fast yet does not get hot on the outside. I am really enjoying using it. Next project is to do some baking. So far toasting, reheating and baking a casserole have been a breeze. And even on a very hot day in the upper 90's it did not produce an unbearable amount of heat. The deal of the day discount made this all the sweeter!

  We are replacing this after only a few months of use. It burns things. It has almost started a fire. It is extremely difficult to clean to the point where all the crumbs are a fire hazard. The bottom has no tray and doesn‚Äôt slide out so you have to lift it up and open the bottom and try to clean it while holding it up. Things go from uncooked to burned so fast that it‚Äôs hard to use. I never write reviews but I can‚Äôt believe this has so many positive reviews. We bought it to replace a toaster oven we had for like 6 years. This thing is scary and our teenage son once had a piece of toast catch on fire inside it. That has never happened with our old one.

  The first thing to know is that this oven is really quite small with a minimum of head room.  This is a ""one or two-person"" toaster oven.  But it seems well built and has quality fit and finish.  We previously had a ""Euro Pro"" model that had served us for many years, but the timer finally gave out.  It was true convection and this one is not.  That also means this one is essentially silent. But the new one heats food up just as fast as the old one, thanks to the really quick glass rod heating elements.  For heating up pizzas, chicken patties, etc. this one does a great job.  I just wish it was a little bigger (hence 4 stars and not 5).

  This is a feature-rich and sleek looking oven that is at home in any house with a modern motif. I can toast, bake, and broil to my liking with this oven and I'm really happy that I went through with the purchase. The two rows of racks let you position what you're heating up or cooking so that it's either away or near the source of heat so you actually get to decide which side is the more crispy side

  I originally received a defective toaster oven (the crumb tray was touching the heating element and would burn every time I used it), but the seller was kind enough to send me a replacement toaster oven. I've had no issues with the new one so far! I still don't love that the crumb tray isn't fully removable - it makes it more difficult to clean, but otherwise its a great toaster oven at a great price.

    Toast function is very unsatisfactory
  
",3.0,Jon,"Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  I mostly bought the Mueller 1100w Ultratemp Toaster Oven because it is advertised as being ""specially designed for even toasting of up to 4 slices of bread"", and I am very disappointed. Unfortunately, I have found the toaster function to be extremely inferior to other toaster ovens by other manufacturers (most of which are not great to begin with). The instructions with the Mueller oven do not even recommend a temperature setting for toast, so I experimented at between 350 - 450 degrees (most often recommended by other manufacturers). The ""light"", ""medium"" and ""dark"" settings on the ""Time"" dial are useless and have no relevance to the way the bread will actually toast.  The ""Broil"" and ""Bake"" functions seem to be reasonably good, but certainly no better than many basic models that are less expensive than this one.

  The door closing mechanism on mine broke after about 6 weeks of moderate use (see photo).The size is just big enough to fit four slices of bread (a little smaller than I was expecting).I was skeptical when it first arrived because it felt cheaply made.  My hunch was correct.

  I use this every day for at least 6 months it‚Äôs great for toast and bacon. I use the toast feature for every thing regardless it cooks the most evenly. I tried cookies heating pizza it‚Äôs not great temperature control. They usually burn on the  bottom and raw on top.

  We understood this was a small oven and that's exactly what we were looking for. It was meant to round out or existing devices.That said we're a bit disappointed in it overall.20 minutes for 2 slices of dark crisp toast is a bit ridiculous. Our toaster does it in 7-8 minutes. My bread is a dense sprouted bread. Lighter white bread is much faster but the oven is still at least twice as long as the toaster.30 minutes to broil 3 - 6 oz pieces of cod. Our old oven did it in less than 9 minutes. Our Ninja indoor grill does it in 6-7 minutes.It works best as a method to reheat food without recooking it. That's if you're willing to wait for it. The heat is so slow that the food doesn't dry out like in a microwave or regular oven.

    Going to replace with something else
  
",2.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  Disappointed in this product and will probably buy a different one to replace it. Only positive is it looks nice and heats up quickly. We always burn ourselves - our old toaster pushed the tray forward when you opened the door which was nice and safer. Also there‚Äôs no way to know how long you are roasting something for and can‚Äôt decrease the time once it has started. When it‚Äôs done toasting, the bell only dings about 1/5 of the time.

  Wow. Out of the box, this oven met my expectations which are high. We've had the Hamilton Beach 2 in 1 for over 15 years and although still working, it's old and a little under-powered. We've since grown to a family of four so toasting bread requires a tad more space and yet, we don't want to take up too much countertop space. This is Perfect sized for our needs. The stainless steel is beautiful and matches our kitchen. The dial from ez bottom rack/bake, top rack/broil & both racks/toast is simple. There's a standard temp setting. And the timer works well, with a mechanical 'ding'. I just followed the directions to clean the inside and 'toast/oven clean' for 15 minutes so indeed the place stunk up (this is a must!!). However, I'm no longer concerned with factory chemicals and can't wait to use it tomorrow. At $60, this seems costly compared to our old 2 in1 at $40 but this thing is gorgeous so we can't wait to test out all the functions. Will edit further as needed.*edit* 17 days later and we've been using this daily. Kids are home and love toasted bread or bagels. The 3-way toast-bake-broil settings work perfectly. Takes a bit to get used to calibrating settings - ex. 450* vs. 400* for the 'toast', middle vs bottom rack placement, & timer (<5 min low-med-high toast functions). That said, we absolutely LOVE this. In fact, my wife recently claimed this as a top electronics purchase for 2020, if not the decade. We're already reheated meats (makes a good 'sear' on leftover roast pork) & chicken nuggets (amazing chicken breast from AmazonFresh) & can't wait to try other 'heavier' things (ex. tater tots although we defaulted to the oven given size). Of note, we tried bacon (4 slices per, twice) and this works perfect. Less mess to clean up or worry about vs. the full-sized oven. I may consider cooking steak, pork chops, or chicken but for now, so far so good. My only complaint, & it's a tiny one is the timer dial requires a '90*' turn to activate well (mechanical spring action), which is is at the 10 min. mark so anything less, you need to 'dial' counterclockwise/back. When cooking, hands are often slipper so not easy to do. The 'notch' marker helps the grip but could be 'deeper' or simply, I just grab a towel or potwarmer. Not a deal-breaker but very noticeable, esp. when I have to 'retoast' my bread for just that extra 10-30 secs. This happens a lot with picky kids where there's a fine balance between 'burnt' & goldilocks just right. All in all, still a 5 star product!! I really can't wait to use it more to avoid having to using my regular oven (a convection one too!), which tends to draw too much heat and trigger my smoke detector (why are they in the kitchen again?!). I ordered separate trays (ex. 7"" round pizza pans) and can't wait to make pizza with the kids. Inside fits 10"" wide x 9"" deep (the included multi-purpose pan is 10"" wide x 8"" deep.. not sure why the 0.5"" gap on each end but perhaps to allow front-back circulation).
