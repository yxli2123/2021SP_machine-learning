  This is exactly what I wanted for a long time. That would tell me to getup and walk when I have been sitting for too long. That would stop me from overdoing the exercises when my heart rate goes up too high. That can even monitor my sleep and breathing. Has a fair battery life. For me one charge every other day. Comfortable to wear. Has some pre-designed exercises that it walks you through and teaches you the proper form and duration/sets. Overall very well worth a buy.

  I bought this watch in May. It worked for one month and wouldn't charge or turn on anymore. Sent it back to Samsung and they wanted to charge me $216 to fix it. They said the waterproof watch had water damage and not covered under warranty. I'll never buy a Samsung product again. Waste if $350.

    Fitness watch

  This watch works well. I would like to see it have a second timer ability so I could use it when teaching my yoga classes and time each side to the same length of holds. But for my own personal fitness tracking it works really well. I notices when I am exercising if I forget to input or begin a workout. It reminds me to get up if I have been sitting too long. I can't seem to get used to wearing it while I sleep so I don't use it for sleep tracking.

  02 December 2020: Review for the Galaxy Watch Active2 with a Galaxy S8 PhoneThis watch is holding up nicely.  No issues; the battery life has not been an issue at all.  I've left the watch in my purse for up to two days and the watch's battery was still providing power.  This is a lovely watch and a smart purchase.20 November 2019: Review for the Galaxy Watch Active2 utilized with a Galaxy S8 PhoneFirst, I want to mention, the Aqua Black color is exactly that.  I was hoping for a black watch but this watch is a dark blue, had I realized that, I'd have gotten a different color but I can't mark the watch down for my mistake.  Just know the aqua black is really a dark blue color.  Aside from this, the watch is beautiful, easy to set up, and works great.  In 7 hours my watch has drained from 100% to 61% battery life.  I don't feel that this is very good battery life.  I have not been heavily utilizing the watch or using it to control anything.  The watch is connect to my phone via Bluetooth and receiving a few notifications but nothing over the top.  The watch does have some nice watch faces that are classic and look great, the band was easy to take off to install a different band.  There are some nice features this watch has.  Overall, I am happy with my purchase.  I plan to review again in the future with battery life and how the watch holds up.

  Es un maravilloso accesorio para tu teléfono y un gran compañero si te interesa hacer deporte y der mas productivo, mide con presición gran variedad de actividades físicas y llevá un seguimiento de tu ritmo cardíaco, su diseño es muy bonito con cuerpo en aluminio y una pantalla espectacular, te permite contestar llamadas por medio de los parlantes y microfono integrado del reloj los cuales para ser sincero me sorprendieron por su calidad, tambien te permite responder mensajes por medio de dictado por voz o una intuitiva y amigable interfaz selectora de letras, sus correas de serie son muy buenas a primera vista se ven y sienten de excelente calidad, tiene varios sensores y entre ellos estan sensor de frecuencia cardíaca, giroscopio y tiene capasidad para hacer un ECG en ciertas regiones del mundo, tiene varias caratulas y fondos de reloj que permiten ver diferentes cosas dependiendo de tus intereses, en caso de tener un Samsung galaxy este es tu reloj ideal aunque tiene conectividad con practicamente todo android y iphone, aqunque tienes que descargar la app propia de Samsung, el unico inconveniente es la batería que aunque esta bastante bien, llegando hasta los 2 dias y medio de uso y es algo similar a lo que encontramos en su competencia el apple watch series 5, no es la mejor y aveces con ciertas aplicaciones no bien optimizadas la bateria se drena aun mas rápido, sientro que esto lo podrian Mejorar en verciones de actualización futura o en proximos modelos del reloj.

    Who Says You Can't Be Active and Productive?

  I work in a nursing home, so washing hands is a must, and having a watch that is water-resistance is a must. The Galaxy Watch Active 2 is great when it comes to water resistance features. A water lock for locking the screen to not worrying about wrist calling someone or sending some message to a random contact. The ability to control music while walking or jogging is a good feature. Oh, getting notifications on the wrist makes it easier not to pull the phone out.The watch has made it easier to maintain a productive and active work day. The watch also provides daily briefings to provide updates on your day.I have not tried the sleep tracking feature much. However, I have given the heartbeat a try, and I have to say it seems to be decent with the tracking. I wouldn't go so far to say it is 100%, but close to 75%.I would recommend this watch to anyone who is active, productive, or both.

  Love this watch! I recently swapped over from iPhone to Android and was missing having a smart watch. Overwhelmed by the large assortment of brands out there for androids I was hesitant on which ones were actually good quality. Struck gold here! I love the watch. Its comfortable to wear and I love the design of the straps. The tutorial makes learning how to use your new watch super easy. I've only had it for a few weeks but I'm in love! And the battery life is amazing!!

  I am REALLY enjoying this, and it's my first smart watch. I got it for the sleep tracking as well as stress checker, reminders and calendar. It is so cool all this watch can do! Syncs up with my phone. Lets me read and send texts and show off pictures of my cats. Easy to set reminders and calendar events.I didn't think the alarm would wake me up since it's quiet and I usually set my alarms max loud and obnoxious, but it does! Very useful when you and your partner keep different hours and you don't want to wake each other up.The customizable faces are a lot of fun. Can be as creative as I want.

  I really wanted to love this watch... I put in a lot of thought into the watch I was going to purchase. One of the main things that I wanted was the sleep tracker. I have had nothing but trouble with the sleep tracker on this watch. I kept thinking that maybe it was me. I have to clean the back of the watch and shut the watch off and turn it back on every night in order for the sleep tracker to work and then it doesn't work every time. Everything else seems to work fine on it. Regretfully, I don't think I would purchase this again. Just shy of $300 is a lot to pay for something that doesn't work the way it should.

    Samsung Galaxy Active 2 40mm smartwatch is a great buy!
  
",5.0,Walter L.,"Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2019","









  
  
    
  Before I get started. I am not by any means an expert on smartwatches nor do I even use all the features.I recently used a Samsung Frontier S3. I really like the size of it and I liked the dial around it that spins to move the screen around and I felt the dial or bezel whatever its called added a layer of protection.Here we go!Pros. I bought this watch for one reason only! The ECG which if the FDA doesn't mess this up will be activated via software update to detect irregular heart rhythms. Because I have Atrial Fibrillation and the Fall Detection because of Hypoglycemia (in cas I pass out from low blood sugar) I am hoping this will be beneficial to me. If not, Ill have a cool watch!Battery Life is amazing!Cons: 1. The 44mm looked to big or just weird in my opinion which it should have compared to my Frontier S3.2. The 40mm looks a little small on my wrist but I can live it.3. The apps don't seem that much different than the ones on the Frontier. I don't use the apps often just timem date and heart rate so don't take my word for that.  I will say it was nice that the icons and all looked nearly the same so I didn't feel like I was learning a whole new system.4. I miss the bezel from the Frontier but this watch was designed for Activity so I can live with it.Don't take all my cons and think this isn't a great watch. 1. I don't know much about smartwatches. 2. I really loved the Frontier S3 design. 3. If Samsung comes out with a watch like the Frontier with ECG, this watch will be for sale.I think its a great watch for those who are using it for the reasons it was designed for. The sale price I got this one for on Amazon made it hard not to buy it.All in all its a great watch despite my bias towards the old Frontier.EDITED TO ADD THE FOLLOWING:The battery life on this watch is amazing!I wore it all day and around 10:45 pm I took the watch off and still had 74% battery life left.It was connected to my phone the entire day.

  Not an overly impressive watch. The distance portion of the step counter doesn't always work and the battery life is aweful. Third part apps are also mostly a joke. Basically, it's very expensive for the functionality it gives. I wouldn't consider this a valuable purchase though it is way better than FitBit. If it worked with the Play Store and Google Pay instead of Samsung's line of applications then I'd give it five stars.

    Best smartwatch hands down.
  
",5.0,Daveenchy,"Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2019","









  
  
    
  Let me tell something, i was always skeptical into buying a smartwatch no matter who was the manufacturer, because to me it always seemed like a gimmick, like a trend that we all will get over it, but sometime has passed a little over 3 years, and boy i was wrong. So this 2019 i bought the S10+ which i already left my review, i love my phone but i was curious over the smartwatch experience that so many people now were having. So i started looking for one, and review after review i noticed that there is many more options available for people on android than iOS. There was fossil, fitbit, huawei, lg, samsung and others. But i realized that the quality of smartwatch made my Samsung was overall the best. I looked for reviews for the Galaxy Watch and the Galaxy Active and was undecided over which one should buy, until the Galaxy Watch Active 2 came out. After reviewing it online i decided that this is the watch i should get. I've been using it a little over a month and let me tell you its awesome. It completely changed my view of smartwatches and usefulness of owning one. The build quality is great, the features great, design is awesome, battery lasts 2 days, i can use almost every strap, the health apps are precise, it can play spotify standalone without having to be connected via bluetooth to my S10+. THIS IS THE BEST SMARTWATCH YOU CAN BUY FOR NON APPLE USERS. GET IT NOW!

    Doesn't correctly track sleep, steps, and cannot be used with an iPhone
  
",1.0,,"Reviewed in the United States December 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  Where do I begin..?First off this doesn't work with an iPhone. This is called a SAMSUNG watch for a reason. So don't buy this if you have an iPhone.SleepThis watch does not do what it is meant to do. It does not track my sleep correctly at all. I breastfeed in the middle of every night, yet my watch shows me that I slept great through the whole night. I have tried tracking it with being connected to my phone and without being connected. I figured the watch would feel me moving so much that it would know I'm not asleep, but nope. Once I unlock the screen is when it shows I wake up.StepsThis watch doesn't track your steps correctly either, unless you are about 7ft tall with huge strides. I don't understand why you wouldn't be able to edit your stride length on the watch or within the app, as you can for other Samsung apps. I realized this didn't correctly track steps because when I disconnect my watch, my phone will show a LOT more steps than my watch. Which is odd since I had my phone in my pocket and watch on the whole time.BatteryLastly, the battery life on this stinks. It's almost 2021, why doesn't this stay charged for longer than about 18 hours of moderate use? It should have a brightness setting so I don't waste so much battery life.Overall, I am very disappointed with this watch and I do not reccomend it.. for anything. Which is sad, because I LOVE Samsung products. I am returning this.

    Only buy if you're invested in Samsung Ecosystem
  
",3.0,Israel,"Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this watch after returning a Fossil Gen 5 Carlyle. While I loved that watch the battery life wouldn't make it through the day. The Active 2 on the other hand has great battery life and is smooth. Unfortunately the Active 2 really tries to force you to use Samsung apps. They force you to use Samsung email in order to respond to emails. They force you to use Samsung Pay. They force you to use Bixby and doesn't give you an option to use any other Assistant. I have a Galaxy Note 10 plus so I figured this would be a good pair but unfortunately I'm more into the Google ecosystem, (I have a Google Home, Chrome cast, etc) If you are heavily invested in the Samsung ecosystem then definitely go for it. As for me I'll have to wait until a decent Google Wear OS watch comes out.

",2.0,Problems with the Seller Breed,"Reviewed in the United States April 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  My watch did come sooner than anticipated which was great! however I immediately knew something was off. From all my research (here in America) I knew that only the LTE version of the Active2 came with a stainless steel case and leather band, so when I saw my bluetooth/wifi model have these I had some questions. Called Breed to see if they could send me a sports band since my model did not come with one like I had anticipated and they were unable to help. Amazon was able to work with me and will refund my purchase of silicone bands. Fast forward to setting up my watch and I notice that I am unable to use Samsung Pay, a major reason why I bought this watch over others. Turns out my model was made in Vietnam for  Latin America where Samsung Pay isn't supported. Currently tinkering with firmware to change region but this was certainly not what I expected and am disappointed. The marginal discount on the watch was not worth this effort. Really hoping I don't have to go through the hassle of returning it and waiting for a new one.

    Love the Look but wish there were more Apps
  
",4.0,PRIME Buyer,"Reviewed in the United States November 2, 2019","









  
  
    
  I do like this product.  The profile is much smaller than any other watch and I love the round shape making it look so much more like a real watch.  The always on feature is nice to quickly glance at time and I really see potential on what Samsung did on the Active 2 with the edge bezel being used for your finger to move thru menus.  There is a learning curve and the app support is very small.  All that said, for now I am getting ~2 days of battery life and I was able to download a 3rd party app to sync my company calendar.  Oh, Samsung tech support went way above and beyond assisting me to get the device working so 5 stars to them.  Only two issues so far are:1)  There doesn't appear to be an app that will sync corporate G-Suite account.  As my company doesn't use IMAPI or POP3, there simply isn't a way to log into gmail from the watch to receive email.  Bummer since in a pinch it would be useful to check receipt of critical emails.2)  Since the bezel finger gesture is so new to Samsung, it isn't yet fully realized.  My example is in calendar instead of navigating to a date on the calendar by pointing to the tiny number for the date on the calendar, it should utilize the ring gesture to scroll.  I opened a feature request so hopefully this will improve.All in all, this is a very attractive watch and good fitness device with a few additional business benefits.  Again, app support is very small so bummer there but hopefully Samsung will incent the ecosystem to grow.  Things like Lyft, Starbucks and navigation like waze / google maps for starters.Oh, I also installed the IQ Shield Screen protector 1st thing very easily.  The pack I got had 6 shields so not yet sure how quickly they scratch however the watch still is relatively responsive and help protect the screen of this $300 computer on my wrist.Consider this.  Not perfect but especially if you don't like the square screen like the Apple Watch and if you are on Android, this is the best out there (in my opinion) as of Nov 2019.

  I wasn't sure if I needed a smartwatch, I've always been a fan of watches and in need to replace my old one I decided to give this a try. The first one I got was fossil gen 5, and despite being a beautiful and useful watch the battery life is way too short, making it very frustrating where you need to constantly control the use or charge it twice a day. Return it and got the Galaxy Active 2, and I'm impressed. The battery lasts for almost 48h and that includes wifi/BT always on, sleep tracking, and 40 min of music plus exercise tracking.Great product, great battery life, beautiful and useful!

  I had pretty high hopes for his watch, but it didn't live up to any of my expectations.Possibly the biggest disappointment is the fact that the only way you can convert your speech into words is by using Samsung's voice recognition, which is subpar. A lot of times it only gets half of my words correct. Google Voice does an excellent job on my Samsung Galaxy S9, but you don't have the option to utilize Google services on this watch.Another huge disappointment is the speed of the watch. The watch face constantly lags when I flip my wrist to activate the wake up gesture. Sometimes it's so slow that the seconds completely freeze up once the Always On screen switches to the normal watch face.I definitely would not purchase this watch again. It doesn't even have any decent apps, and you have to purchase all the actual quality watch faces.

  For 6 months I loved this watch! It is sleek, the apps are similar to apple, etc. Then, it started acting glitchy, and the touch screen quit working in the center. I was able to occasionally get it to answer the phone, but I noticed water would spurt out the speakers. I did wear it in the pool since it is rated at 150 meters (my pool is 5' deep). I put it in rice for a week to dry it out and I was able to get it to come on, but I cant answer calls/texts, or use the workout apps. So, I just did an online search and others had the same issue. Unfortunately, Samsung doesnt honor the warranty for water damage (even though it is rated for swimming). So, now, after 6 months , I'm having to purchase a new watch. Don't buy if you plan on sweating, wearing in the shower, or swimming.

    Not a US version as Advertised
  
",1.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  Update 9/17/20: I recently have been in a back and forth with Amazon and Samsung. Turns out that the product was a refurbished international model. So therefore it was not covered under warranty. Samsung called me and said that they can send it back without repair. I decided to contact amazon and tell them the situation, they said they would give me a refund with a stocking fee since it is out of the return window. I told them it was unacceptable and I was thinking of taking legal action because it was falsely advertised (Seeing as it said the US version and was an international model). They ended up giving me a full refund. The seller needs to do a better job of advertising and not having false information on the amazon site. Do not buy this watch on this website, go to an authorized retailer so you do not run into the same issues that I did.I bought this watch as I wanted to upgrade from my old Samsung watch. I have been loyal to Samsung for years. After several months of usage. I started noticing when my phone was having difficulty connecting to my watch it goes into standalone mode, which drains the batter in about 5 hours as opposed to 2.5 days. I turned off all the apps that I do not use, it still will drain quickly and also has difficult connecting after troubleshooting. It is sad that it is marketed as a longer lasting watch but after a couple of months it dies so quickly. I have reached out to Samsung and they are saying ordering on Amazon may not be authorized for a warranty repair. I like the watch but this is getting really irritating.

  I have been using this for about 5 months, and it is overall a good watch. I liked everything about it, the only drawback is the battery life (2 days at most). Something I noticed is that recently it started to work slowly for some reason, I optimize it, close recent pages often, but still I notice that it sometimes works slow or freezes. Except that everything is great, and it works the way it should.

  Be careful about how you handle this watch.  The back plane fell off so I returned it for repair and they said that it was out of warranty because the back fell off.  If they had made it more sturdy, then the back would have not fallen off.  They charged me $139.64 to get it repaired.  After complaining they lowered it to $70.02.  Funny that Henry the supervisor did give me a discount when it should have been under warranty and no charge.  What was I going to do.  They had me by the.  Be worried if the back plane falls off because you will be told that it is out of warranty because YOU caused the problem not Samsung.  So in the end I have now paid $370.01.  Thanks to Samsung and Amazon.  Amazon you let companies like Samsung take advantage of your Prime Customer.Ed

    Silent alarms
  
",3.0,Shea Medlin,"Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2019","









  
  
    
  I absolutely HATE that silent alarms are not the default and there doesnt seem to be a way to make it the default or even change it quickly. It it such a hassle that I have to manually scroll through pages of settings to adjust each alarm independently and if I forget one (easy to do as I have a variable schedule) I'm jarred awake by the loud, annoying sound coming from my wrist. The only reason I bought a smartwatch was for the things it can do that a phone can't. Such as a silent alarm. I can't even ask Bixby to set a silent alarm, because it replies that it can't name alarms! What is Bixby even for if it can't do simple tasks?? This watch can do a lot of things, but it misses the mark on some of the basics. I'm thinking about returning the watch and going back to my Fitbit because of this.

    Samsung removed O2 sat tracking, sleep tracking poor
  
",2.0,maw,"Reviewed in the United States December 14, 2019","









  
  
    
  I really, really wanted to like this watch. In the 10 days I have had it, I have spent hours trying to figure out basic operations. It seems like I would have been better off with another fitbit. Samsung has removed the pulse ox reading. Now it apparently reads it in the background and calculates some sort of mythical ""stress score"" instead of simply showing oxygen saturation. You apparently need to download a previous version of the app to restore it but I can't find it (and I'm apparently not alone). Sleep is also off (and other reviewers say the same). Somehow, it shows I am only asleep 2 hours out of the 7 that I was (asleep) and in bed. Given that even my broken fitbit is more accurate, I am declaring this feature to be sadly inaccurate. For BP, you need to get a 3rd party app and calibrate with a separate BP device. I am not optimistic about the potential ECG in development either. Step counter is questionable. I find some features easy to use. Like the watch face choices. But a LOT of features are cumbersome and not intuitive. I will continue to check it out. I have another 4 - 5 weeks to return it but definitely considering a return. Disappointing - so sad.

  Bought this earlier this year. Had a cheap on from walmart that was not the best at anything. Biggest reason for needing one, was to monitor my heart rate especially while I was sleeping. Also needed it to help keep track of my workouts and activity. I will say, I was worried at first about the sizing because I had previously owned an Apple watch that was a lot smaller and I have pretty small wrists, but I don't find the size to be uncomfortable. Its comfortable to wear all day and even at night. Works well with my Galaxy Note 9 phone. Tracks everything like it is supposed to. Would definitely recommend to others! Its worth it!

    Not that great for just fitness tracking but good as a smart watch
  
",3.0,,"Reviewed in the United States November 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had a fitbit charge 2 for tracking mainly sleep, heart monitor and walk/exercise.  Its screen cracked after 4 years and I wanted something different, a bit more fashionable. I use Samsung phone so I searched for feminine, light, tracker and long lasting battery.  It looks nice and band is comfortable but it's an ok tracker.  It has so many functions and options that I don't need or use.  My biggest complaint is the battery.  I charged over 24 hours before I start it.  If I'm on regular mode it only last 24-30 hours.  If I'm on battery saving mode it last 72-80 hours.  It described on the website that the battery can go for more than a 5 day on a single charge but it never has.  I don't now how many times it died on me when I expected it to last for a couple of days.  I think I saw somewhere that the battery life got batter after a few times of full charge.  I logged my battery charge for 3 weeks and not much improvement.  The second complaint is that it does not pick up exercise automatically.  Fitbit used to figure out on its own without I push the start button in certain category.  I do jumping jack everyday and it doesn't count 1/2 of them.  I do yoga pilate and no matter how hard or easy I do, it just measure by time.  One thing I liked a lot was I can receive phone calls and messages on my watch.  I don't talk or text back through my watch but at least I can see who's calling and read my messages BUT when I'm in treadmill mode, it will not let me go back to main screen or check messages without stop the treadmill timer.  I have to stop, confirm ""finish"" then return to main page.  hm... so much for fancy function.  Also, wish it had a font control to make it larger.  Many of them can't be read without my glasses.Well, it seems a great smart/toy watch for a younger generation.  If you are like me, an older person looking for a simpler but savvy fitness tracker, this is not it.  If my insurance didn't replace my tracker, I would have been sad to spend this much money that doesn't do what I expected it to do.

  This watch left me very conflicted. The purpose of me purchasing this watch was for tracking my heart rate, daily steps, and sleep. The device failed to accurately track every metric. The watch could never hold a consistent reading of my heart rate while doing cardio, lifting, or even sleeping (and yes I tried adjusting the placement and tightness of the watch and cleaning the sensor). Also the steps calculated would always be crazy high, sometimes 2,000 steps higher than my girlfriend who followed the path as I. But, the watch as an extension of my phone worked WONDERFULLY.  It's a beautiful watch that has a big bright display,  it holds battery life for days, it's user friendly and super customizable. I wanted to like this watch, I was very conflicted about returning it.  But I can't justify spending the money on it when I intended to buy it for fitness tracking. I don't understand how this watch is called active when it doesn't do anything to aid in your healthy lifestyle.

    Good Smartwatch/Activity tracker, but not great.

  The Galaxy Watch Active2 is a beautiful smartwatch that pairs nicely with the Galaxy S10. It's been about a month now since my purchase and I have no regrets so far. However, as a longtime Fitbit wearer (Charge, Charge II, Charge 3) I guess you could say I had high expectations for some of its advertised functions.The short: If you're looking for a sleek fitness tracker that can monitor your steps, sleep habits, heart rate, and incoming text messages/phone calls, there's likely a cheaper alternative for you that'll do a more accurate job. If you don't mind spending extra money for GPS functionality and a fancy screen with mediocre fitness activity/sleep stats, buy an Active2.The long(er): As a person that's obsessed with stats, I was really excited to finally get my hands on a flagship smartwatch that doubled as a fitness tracker to pair with my Galaxy S10. My Fitbit Charge 3 was serving its purpose well, but it was finally time to fork over some extra $$ and get my hands on (what I thought was) a more detail-oriented & stats-driven smartwatch. Originally, I was going to purchase the latest Galaxy smartwatch, but the idea of having a less-bulky watch that would accurately measure my activity during the day/sleep at night was far-more appealing to me. If this is your first and ONLY fitness tracker, it's possible that you could be blown away by its results. However, having owned several Fitbits over the years and comparing my experiences, I feel like the Smartwatch functionality of the Active2 diminishes the capability of its fitness tracker. If you're looking for a stylish Smartwatch that can handle your standard smartwatch needs as well as a basic overview of your activity for the day, the Active2 will not disappoint. If you're looking for accurate statistics on heart-rate, sleeping behavior and daily steps, perhaps consider going the cheaper route and getting something that's centered around exactly what you're looking for.  It does look cool, though. So that's nice.

  I had been a Fitbit Versa Lite wearer but I had a Samsung watch so I decided to spoil myself with the Samsung watch. Big mistake and here it is 4 days too late to return it and that is on me. First, it does not hold a charge for even two days - pitiful.  It does not come on when you flick your wrist like Fitbit does.  It does not show your heart rate and steps unless you go scrolling through the faces to find it. It is attractive and comfortable on the wrist, but I would like it to be as good or better than the Fitbit and it is far from it. Now mine is shutting off for some reason and unlike the Fitbit pushing the button on the side does not bring it on. I could have bought one of the cheap off brand watches and had a better experience. If you do get it, be sure to watch your return date so you do not lose $200 like I did.

  I enjoyed this watch while it lasted (only 9 months and a few days). Within a month of really careful use, some of the pixels in the 12 o'clock area died. If that was all that had gone wrong, I would still have given this watch a solid 4 stars because it performed well in quite a few areas.Bluetooth pairing with my cellphone was very reliable and the Galaxy Wearable and Samsung Health apps were very functional. The Samsung Health app provided detailed analytics on sleep patterns,  heart rate and daily step count.During workouts, the audible reports of distance, heartrate and elapsed time were very useful for adjusting my pace and made it easy to achieve fitness goals. Notification of meeting the daily step target was always motivating. A tremendous number of watch faces was available to suit almost any mood or purpose.In the nine months I owned this watch, I never once showered or swam with it. I did have on a watch protector which retained some moisture when I would wash my hands although most times I would remove the protector and dry off the watch. I am very disappointed that a 200 dollar watch that claims to be water resistant ended up with the bottom falling off.

It has better water proof rating, it's much lighter, the stock band is more comfortable.  I've always liked a watch with a mechanical bezel but the swiping on the Active 2 is great.  Understanding it's a different style than the S3 (that is, less like an analog watch in appearance and obvious much more a watch competing with the Apple watch) I think it's a great upgrade.

  Diary of a Fitness Watch Addict. My name is Joe and I am a fitness watch addict. So far I have owned a Garmin Vivoactive 4, Garmin Venu, Huawei GT 2 (2 of them), Fitbit Blaze, Galaxy Active 2, Apple SE, and a host of watches for under $100 that promise the world (but give very little.)Lets talk.....Garmin watches. Neither Garmin watch that I owned could ply music direct to earbuds. No matter what I tried. For some reason, everytime I tried to set this feature uo, it failed. It will get you outside though becuase you have to go out there and gain GPS coordinates in order to listen to music. I don't know why; as an addict I just did as directed. It never worked. I purchases earbuds Garmin suggested and....nothing. Every once in a whil It would work, but only briefly and then,,,,,time to go outside again. The Vivoactive screen is as washed out as any I have ever seen. Battery life is metsa-metsa and that is if you don't do much. I imagine if I was able to get music it would have cut the battery life even more. The venu has a much better screen;  however, the cost in battery life is significant.Garmin watches remind me of Microsoft computers. Spend more time diddling with them then using them. Sold mine on eBay.The Huawei GT 2. Now there is a watch. Well made, beautiful to look at, battery life forever, syncs music flawlessly. I would love to have kept this watch. Unfortunately I don't live in China where this watch works. In the usa this watch will only count active calories and is extremely arbitrary and capricous regarding how many you are going to get. Frustrating as hell. Don't bother with customer service. When you tell them you are in the US you will be sent to HOLD purgatory. The one thing that this watch could do is estimate treadmill distance. I mean accurate to 1/50th of a mile. Garmin was 10 percent off every 1/4 mile and no matter how many times I would enter stridelength or the correct distance traveled on the treadmills display it would again display a significant error. Like I said, if you like dicking around with your fitness watch.Fitbits Fitbits. I lost 50 lbs when my wife bought me one of their first models. That wrist-wife had me up walking at night to finish my goals before midnight. Now...eh...I mean monthly Fitbit fees. I don't think so.Galaxy active 2. Here is a watch that does everything/nothing. Again, if you like dicking with watches. First is the calorie counting which is horrible on every watch I have had. This watch is so horrible at it that, wven though it is monitoring heatrate and Sp02 your results are a joke. Don't believe me. Take the watch off, start a workout, and watch the unearned calories start adding even though you are doing nothing. A million workouts to choose from. Try adding boxing or a host of other workouts to the watch. Not going to happen! Also, because their calorie counting is so flawed they removed total calories burned from the watch so you can't view them. Sold mine on eBay.So, let me save you. The Apple watch SE. Thank you God! Battery life is crap and promised to be crap so no disappointment. Syncs to Apple SE phone flawlessly; like without your help. Every workout is listed and has a specialized formula for calorie count that is amazingly accurate. Frankly I am so happy with this watch I could go on for hours. So if you feel that you are burning 300 calories a day in frustration sweat while you are trying to get your newest fitness watch to monitor your health, try the apple. Pay a little more save yourself the aggrivation.

",3.0,Dan Schlimme,"Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  I am a tried and true Samsung fan, but i have to say, this watch still has a long way to go.  It is leaps ahead of the original Active, but there are a lot of incompatibilities and issues.The watch forces you to utilize all Samsung native applications which is great if you are the 1% of the world who does that.  I use apps like, google assistant (not available), gmail (not available) google calendar (not avaialble), android messages (not avaialble), amazon music (not avaialble), Google Maps (avaialble if you pay for a third party tool), and many more.I purchased this for the Golf option which looks like it would work great.  its a little clunky but it would definitely do the trick.  It is also great for exercise as it has a ton of options and sensors, but in my option, that doesnt out weigh the lack of integration with applications i use day to day

    Good when it works - Dead just one month after warranty expired
  
",2.0,LightAnt,"Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2021","









  
  
    
  I had used the watch for just over a year. There were some minor issues here and there, but overall, it was a good enough experience. It had a lot of features that I now am missing because, my watch died for no reason. It died just one month after the warranty expired during a software update. Reading customer service experiences and the cost involved to repair it, I didn't even bother contacting Samsung.I should mention that unlike many other reviews here, I had no issues while swimming with the watch, either in pools or at the beach. The watch died months after I lastly swam or got the watch wet, so, that was definitely not the cause of the watch dying.I will still share my overall experience below...My most used features were;Sleep trackingStep counterWorkout featureMic for callsViewing whatsapp messagesCalendar notificationsI mostly had no issues with the above. The watch itself was generally responsive, but at random times it seemed to slow down or freeze a bit. I do not like slowdowns, so, because of this, I would have rated the watch 4 stars. It packs good features.The issues were mostly with the phone app. Sometimes the watch had issues syncing with the phone (Galaxy S10+). I suspect this is what killed the watch during updating it as well, because it lost connection, and then the watch was a brick. Nothing works. It's just completely dead.But because of it dying just shortly after it becoming out of warranty, I simply cannot recommend this watch, and I give it two stars. Normally, this would be getting 1 star, but, I like its features.I am looking to get something else now, because I don't want to spend $200 every year, and I am apparently very lucky that swimming with the watch or washing it didn't immediately kill it. Samsung's reputation with customer service doesn't help either.

  I really like this watch. My only complaint is the step counter.  It is way low. I  compared it to my Fitbit Zip and the Zip always has a higher count.  I've determined that the problem is that any time I walk without moving my arms (mowing the lawn, pushing a shopping cart, etc.) the steps are not counted. If I walk around the block with nothing in my hands, the step counts are pretty close.  I doubt the problem is unique to Samsung watches.  All watches probably have the same issue.

  I purchased this to replace my Fitbit Charge 3.  Samsung calculates sleep stages differently than fitbit. Because of this, it states I never get any deep sleep.  The stair sensor doesn't work in the US because it is set to detect 12 feet between floors. Ours are 10 feet so I never get any stairs. The main reason I purchased this watch was the ability to have a non apple watch that did ECG and fall detection.  Samsung promise, in writing this watch would have it but they still have not released an update to turn it on.

  I purchased this Galaxy Watch Active 2 on May 30, 2020, for 289.98, within 3 months the watch had stopped working, I contacted Amazon who put me in touch with the Samsung service center since the watch came with a 1 year warranty.  I sent the watch to Samsung to make the necessary repairs and received the watch back the same condition that I sent it-totally black and saying that it was charged 100%.  I again contacted customer service and requested a refund, I was told the repair dept. needed to make two attempts to repair the watch before my refund request could be considered.  I reluctantly sent it back again for repair... after a few more days, I received an email, informing me that the watch could not be repaired and that they were sending me a replacement watch.  I called immediately and again requested a refund-it was denied and I was told that they did not do refunds.  I received my new replacement watch but they failed to include either a new charger or my old charger, so now I have a phone and no charger.  Placed another call to customer service and I was told that they would send me out another charger in between 24 and 72 hours... That was on a Thursday... Monday I called to ask for a tracking number and I was told that ""There was no tracking number.""  What?  I am just beside myself if you know what I mean.  Today is Thursday 27th, and as of 1:30 PM still no charger.  I contacted Amazon and they were willing and able to rectify my issues and they made me a happy Amazon customer!

",5.0,R. Spence,"Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2019","









  
  
    
  I like this watch more than I expected to. I had the Samsung Gear 3 and it was just OK. The Active 2 is sleeker, thinner and works better with my phone (Samsung Galaxy 9+). I bought the 44mm model and it wears smaller than the dimensions indicate. The strap that comes with the watch is comfortable and long enough for big wrists. Any after market watch strap in a 20mm width will work with this watch, so there are lots of options. My only real issue is the sleep monitoring, which isn't as good as the Fitbit. I believe Fitbit does a much better job of reporting your sleep. This isn't a deal breaker for me, and maybe Samsung will update or tweak the softwear. For Android users, this could be the best Smartwatch out there.

  The watch is ok but certainly not worth $250. I bought this for its workout features but it pauses all the time while you are working out and will not resume. Many people have posted to Samsung's community asking for a fix but ehy have been ignored. I stayed on hod with customer service for a half hour only to be told I needed to be transferred to someone who could help but I was transferred to an automated message saying I had to call between 9 - 6 (so I am not sure why I was transferred). Anyway, its big for me, unattractive appearance and uncomfortable when I sweat. Its metrics are also way off - does not measure sleep correctly - says I am sleeping when I am awake and vice versa, so I just don't see what the watch does for $250, so its going back

  I tried it for about 3 weeks and had to return it. As a health watch it did not live up to the hype at all. While I did love the look/size, customizable features, Bixby routines, and integration with samsung phone, it was not what I was looking for to replace my Fitbit Blaze. After a couple of days I realized that the step tracking and heart rate was WAY off. I went into the Samsung Health app and updated height, etc and decided to try a couple more days. That did not fix the issue so I got in contact with the Samsung customer service where they essentially told me I could try rebooting it completely but it would likely not fix the problem. I rebooted the watch and sure enough the problem remained. I decided to wear alongside my Fitbit for a couple days and the difference was huge. On the Samsung watch my HR was 77 on the Fitbit (and manually taking) HR was 54 and stepwise Samsung read 3000s for the day while Fitbit read 8000s. If I tried taking my HR on the Samsung health app in phone, it was accurate and would sync to accurate HR on the watch, but who wants to do that daily when the watch is marketed to do it automatically?!If I was just looking for a smart watch to integrate text messages, music player, weather, pay, etc. this would be a great watch. Simply not what I was looking for to replace my current watch, I might look into the new Fitbit Versa as their health monitoring programs seem much more accurate.

  I guess I had bigger expectations.

It's also nice to have your calendar and weather on your wrist.  I really like how you can use it as Spotify remote as well.They shouldn't be bragging about the battery life, it lasts maybe 2 days.

  Having used a FitBit Charge2 for years, I wanted something that was a little bit more stylish and capable while still tracking my fitness stuff well.  The Active2 is certainly a well made and nice looking watch, good looking interface, watch faces, and the Tizen OS and battery life is leaps and bounds better than the top end WearOS devices (I actually returned a Fossil Gen5 to get this Samsung Active2).  The watch however needs some serious help on the fitness tracking - While I find step count and heart rate sensors to be accurate, the GPS distance comes up short, the treadmill estimations are even shorter, the calorie count is absurdly short (about 600-800 for me), and the ""floors climbed"" tracking is completely broken.  Samsung's own Samsung Health app will show 100's of feet of elevation gain during a run and credit you for, maybe 1 or 2 floors, if you're lucky.  If you're going to bill it as a smartwatch / fitness tracker, you might consider having the fitness tracking part work.  Buy some Fitbit products, Samsung, study 'em, and fix your code and algorithms!  Easy enough!  And then it would be a 5 Star Watch!

  Operation wise the watch works well. Tracks sleep time but don't necessarily believe it's measurements of the stages. Records distance and speed accurately. The phone apps are a little annoying and Samsung health on the watch is missing some activities, but overall it's good.Construction wise, mine had a major flaw. When I went to high altitude/low air pressure, the glass face popped out of the metal housing. I pushed it back it. Contacted Samsung for a warranty repair, sent it in, and they wanted me to pay to replace the LCD which wasn't broken. So I got it back unfixed and unsealed so probably isn't waterproof anymore.

    Great Phone with one major drawback - only 1.3GB usable storage (out of 4GB)
  
",2.0,MTBDET,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2021","









  
  
    
  The Active 2 is sleek and stylish and comfortable. The LTE version offers ability to use basic smartphone features from the watch directly without having to have it tethered to my smartphone so I can leave the phone at home while going for a walk or jog or in the car or locker while doing other workouts. That is a godsend.It activated just fine through Verizon and it linked up easily with my Samsung S21 plus through the Galaxy Wearables app. I hear these watches work best with a Samsung phone for best functionality.The phone is fast and responsive to inputs and while I haven't owned it long yet, it can easily last well over a day on a single charge. I basically upgraded from a Samsung Gear Fit2 and the interface is familiar to me, so the OS is basically an evolution, which is nice so the learning curve is reduced.It is lightweight and has low profile buttons and no thick surrounding bezel make it unobtrusive for general every day use and especially nice for working out.There is one glaring flaw with this watch, however. That is the paltry 4 GB of ""storage"", of which with a clean, new OS, only about 1.3GB is usable. That may have been sufficient for a basic smartwatch from four or five years ago, and on my Gear Fit2, with its 4GB of storage, it had over 2.5GB of usable storage for music. But for a top end smartwatch with LTE capability, having only 1.3GB of actual usable storage is laughable.You can free up a little bit of space by deleting watch faces, and maybe a handful of apps, although most are pretty useful and don't use much space to begin with, otherwise there's no way to gain more storage. With the available space you might be able to store 150 songs at best, but that leaves no room for adding apps or other options in the future. You shouldn't have to be storage restricted on a device like this and juggle music constantly on and off the device. Plus, just hope future OS updates don't make the installation size larger reducing usable storage even more.It does support Spotify streaming, and if you're a Spotify user that is a good feature especially if you have a decent data plan. But otherwise you will be quite limited in the number songs you can store locally on the phone. I use a lot of ripped live concert albums which isn't readily available on Spotify, and not about to add  $120/year subscription on top of an already $120/year add-on for adding my watch to my data plan.Overall it is a very nice watch. Just for a top end smartwatch in 2021 the 4GB storage almost makes it unusable. I am considering the Galaxy Watch 3 instead because it comes with 8GB RAM and otherwise same specs. I just prefer the sleeker look of the Active 2.

  Got this watch for my girlfriend. This is her review:As an active person, I teach multiple fitness classes throughout the week, I like pink, and my boyfriend wanted to give me a birthday gift to match my personality.LOOKS:The watch looks great, it's lightweight and the pink is pretty. The face of the watch is also easy to use. That's why I gave it 2 stars. But, unlike other reviews, I did find it uncomfortable to wear. I have a small wrist and it's very noticeable when I'm carrying something on it. It also left marks on my wrist, I tried wearing it a bit more loose but then it won't track your movements properly. Which takes us to the next point.FUNCTIONALITY:If you're familiar with Samsung, they have an ""Active"" phone line. Which means it'll withstand moving, getting wet, dropping it, etc. It doesn't necessarily mean it's for Fitness people. I know that the watch advertises ""advanced fitness tracking"" but it won't track your fitness as it relates to your weight or heart rate. Instead, the watch will track your moves based on average data they've gathered (from somewhere). So imagine: your calories burned in the aerobics workout you just did is an average of the calories burned in an average aerobics workout for someone else, not you. Also, I found that most of the time this watch didn't know when to start tracking the workout so I had to start it myself. Many of the workouts that I teach aren't included on the workout list you pick from, hence why I had to say it was an ""aerobics workout"", whether it was Zumba, toning for legs or arms or abs, circuit training, Pilates, Mat Pilates. I think it does have Yoga but it's not like it matters anyway because it'll give you an average of a light, medium, or high intensity Yoga class that someone else took, not you. It doesn't have many workouts to choose from. Also, I found that the option to choose your workout and talk you through it doesn't work very well either. In addition, my watch maybe was broken because I'd be standing up and walking but as soon as I sat down, it would say ""time to get moving"" because I'd been inactive for too long according to the watch... Needless to say, I wasn't impressed. You can turn off this option as it's annoying but then you won't know if your watch is working properly or not.BATTERY LIFE:Had to charge it every other day.SMARTWATCH FUNCTIONS:This is a smartwatch you'll pair with your phone. You can get text messages, take phone calls, check a few apps on your watch, see if you got an email, and have quick replies. However, I didn't think this watch was that advanced. I didn't even turn on Bixby because I've heard that it needs a lot of improvements. When the watch ""talked to me"" during workouts, the voice was extremely robotic.PRICE:For the functionality it offers and the sleek look, you could buy this watch but I found it expensive. It doesn't do what it advertises very well. I don't think it's worth it. Maybe future versions will be better.BOTTOM LINE:If you're looking for fitness tracking, don't buy this watch. If you're looking for smartwatch functionalities and a Samsung Watch, try a different one. This one isn't worth it.

  The watch is fine, however it is not very water resistant. It became water damaged, but I never swam with it or submersed it. Washing hands and showering is the most it ever got wet. Sent it to Samsung while under the warranty period, they refused to fix it under warranty. They wanted 219.00 to fix the watch. Refurbished ones are cheaper than that. Very disappointed in customer support. Samsung has lost a customer.

  I see no benefit in comparison to my android wear watch aside from better battery life, I will make some quick notes on my problems with the watch.Notifications - I can't imagine anyone preferring the notification system of samsung in comparison to android wear, it is significantly more annoying to handle many notifications on samsung than it is to do so on android wear both reading and discarding.Phone battery drain - this thing uses so many apps and services that I have noticed a significant increase in battery drain when switching from android wear to samsung.Phone audio problem - In some situations this watch can some how disable the phones loud speaker so for example if you have an app that plays audio through the loud speaker like for example youtube or a 3rd party alarm app it will either not play any sound at all or play it through the ear piece on the phone.

  I've had every version of the Samsung watch and this is definitely my favourite. My second favourite was the Gear S3 but at times it seems rather bulky. I like the minimalistic feature of the original Active but no touch bezel and the screen was quite small. This is the perfect size for me and it looks damn good on my arm, smaller than the Gear S3 while having a bigger size screen. I was a bit worried because the cloud silver looked rather blue in the images but it is actually a matte finished silver and the band is grey.

  This watch has made things so much easier for me. I don't have to carry around my phone in my pocket all of the time. I can see who is calling/texting without getting my phone. I can read my texts, respond to them, and use the phone on the watch. There are  a variety of watch faces you can download, but I wish they also had more options. For example: some have no option to remove your heart rate on the display or the step count. I don't generally want to see those things every time I look at my watch.On that note, I am not sure how accurate some of the measurements are. I got told by my watch to get up and move, because I'd been sitting still for almost an hour. But I had only been sitting for 20 minutes and was moving around a lot before that. Although I keep the watch pretty tight on my wrist, it didn't register my sleep patterns very accurately. There were times where I was asleep for a couple of hours and it registered me as awake. If you need precise data, I wouldn't count on this. The battery life is OK. I still charge it once a day. I'd say it would last probably 2 days for the  light to moderate user. I keep the ""always on"" function on, which definitely drains some battery.I guess I am used to having a million options on a cell phone, but the settings on the watch are also very basic. There aren't a lot of apps available. The app on the phone that goes with it is decent. I think it is just a newer technology and they haven't invested as much time in it as they have with other products (understandably). Aside from the variety watch faces and easily changed wrist bands (which are cool), I wish this was able to be customized more. The icons are pretty basic looking.  The messaging app is not very user friendly. It is difficult to open a conversation from a notification that a message just came in. I find myself fiddling around with it a lot when I want to see the whole conversation, especially if I got two messages in a row from the same person. I have to open the conversation to see both. It is functional enough and I do enjoy the convenience. These are just minor annoyances.Overall I do recommend this. It just needs a little polishing (figuratively) and more options when it comes to future development.

  As a left hander the heart rate sensor does not work 95% of the time thus giving me extremely inaccurate workout data. To the point I have to put this trash watch on my left wrist for to work 80% of the time. Thanks for not including a smaller wristband!! Distance is also a great issue because it is far behind the distance actually ""traveled"" on a treadmill.As with everything Samsung couples software and hardware together on, the software is absolutely pathetic. Don't bother buying if you enjoy sending messages from your wrist (unless you don't have a Samsung phone, which I'm not sure how that experience is, or you love the lackluster Samsung messenger app), or anything with efficiency and smoothness. And where is the smoothness everybody keeps going on about?  Samsung's pension for irritating is in full and constant effect. You cannot ever get rid of the intrusive prompt ""make Samsung messages default messenger app"" every damn time you want to use the messaging app. And Samsung hasn't and will not put an alternative use Android's default messenger which is, as always, Enterprise instead of 1st semester college level.Speaking of enterprise, I do not experience a fluid and smooth operating system at all. If you don't use the lackluster touch bezel the OS shows you just how poor it performs. Then there's the brilliant low battery prompt in the middle of exercise (anything. Regardless of importance) that does not go away on its own. Ever! This along with all the ads and the intrusive SmartThings (avoid!!!!!!!) no longer working on a local network while the phone is on a VPN is absolutely frightening.All I read when I owned my TicWatch pro 4G was how bad Wear OS is/was compared to tizen. That is complete and utter trash because those are just statements and they never back it up with any argument or examples. I've used both and Samsung's watch is crap and lacking severely in many areas--such as openness and choice without consequence (remove the annoying Samsung default Message prompt.  It makes Samsung look weak and desperate to force their software on people.  And it's damn amateur.)If you have a exotic drive for Samsung because you feel it's the Apple equivalent on Android, no.

  For starters, the wristband is awful the way you have to tuck one end thru the buckle then under the strap. Cumbersome. I bought a new band, another 30 bucks. I thought getting a watch where you swipe the face to get to functions would be more efficient. It is not. I look for one thing and that is heartrate. You have to go through your phone to reconfigure the watch to enable a screen to only show HR. Accuracy and time in an activity are way off.  Today time should have been 43 minutes of anaerobic activity  and a HR up near 140. It registered time as 28 minutes and HR of 89. A much better value is Polar. I have had two of their watches for years. You can not beat them for accuracy and withstanding wear and tear.

  Initially, I loved the watch. Worked well as a smart watch and activity tracker for my needs. However, one day it began flashing and not responding. I contacted Samsung support and they had me send it in. The watch was still under warranty, but after they received it, they said it would cost over $200 to repair because the warranty was voided due to being exposed to water. I explained i only showered with it, never swam (which its supposed to be water resistant to 5M), and always had the water mode on. Their only response was ""there's water damage and the warranty is voided"". There is no way to prove water damage is device issue and not user error, so they refused to cover. A new watch can be purchased for less than the repair. They clearly don't stand by their product.

  I've only had this watch for three days now, but I highly recommend it. I'm writing this in hopes of helping others choose this watch.Backstory (skip if you don't want to read): I've had two other Samsung galaxy watches over the years. The s2 and the s3 frontier. I got the s3 as a gift and just a week ago, it unexpectedly broke. I bought this as a replacement. The only things I've only ever used my watches for has been for tracking my cycling (I go everyday) and for telling the time and controlling music. The previous two have worked perfect for this.Sizing: the s2 and s3 were 42 mm and 46 mm respectively. I always thought the s3 looked a little big on my wrist, as my wrist is about 6.3 inches in circumference. I had a lot of trouble deciding whether to buy this watch in 40 mm or 44 mm, as many people on reddit recommend 40 mm for wrists below 6.5 inches. I ended up buying the 44 mm, and I think it looks great. The pictures don't show it, but I think it fits my wrist perfectly. The only problem is the band for the watch is on the tightest setting. I might even puncture a hole to have a tighter fit.Sports tracking: I don't run or do many other sports, but I do go 15 miles a day via bike. The s3 worked great for that, and this watch does as well, so far. The only problem I've had is with the auto pause feature (when off the bike to take a water break, the watch is supposed to automatically pause). It's very finicky, but that's the only complaint. It takes my heart rate accurately and I synced my Samsung health with strava via the phone app to track my biking.Battery life: I've only had it for a few days, but these past two days I've tried charging it to full in the morning and seeing where it was at night. Keep in mind that I go cycling in the morning and use GPS the whole time. For both days, it drained about 30% battery (from 100 to 70ish) for a day that was 7:30 am to 11:30 pm. I think that's pretty good, and I charge it while I'm in the shower and wear it to sleep for sleep tracking. The charging is relatively fast, enough for it to almost be 100 before I sleep after a 15 min charge.Durability/ waterproofing: I heard a lot of people say that they use this watch for swimming, but I'm too scared to take a 250 dollar device into the pool. I wouldn't personally recommend it. The durability seems good though, but I haven't run into any problems.Accessories: I have a few recommendations so far. I bought a screen protector and a ringke bezel protector. Both are present in the photos and I think it looks great, as well as providing looks. I highly recommend both, as it gives me comfort that I won't break the watch. On my old s3, I scratched the bezel a lot, but that one was metal and this one isn't. Also, for watch faces, the one I have is called minimal data weather. I also recommend iris25. The apps on the store for the watch are cool and all, but they don't serve much functionality in my eyes. The charging base is a little inconvenient as it's just a small disk, so I recommend getting a base that it can click into so it stands like the s2 and s3 charging bases do.Overall review: I'm very happy with the watch and I recommend this to anyone needing a watch. Read the other sections for my personal views on the watch, and I hope everyone has an amazing day. Hope this helped.Update:After two weeks of having the watch and using it everyday, the back panel/plate came off. The adhesive stopped sticking well. Luckily, I was within the return period and I replaced it with a new one. If the same issue occurs again, I'll be leaving a one star but for now, it mightve just been a fluke with that watch. Still a good watch.

  I wasn't sure if I wanted to go with United States version or the international version. I opted to go with the US version. The only difference is Samsung pay won't work in the international version and there's a possibility you might not be able to install updates. Anyway the watch is very lightweight beautifully crafted and works very well. The screen is super bright and the audio for calls and music is better than expected. Probably will buy another band at some point not because there's anything wrong with the silicone band it comes with but I like to have options depending on how I'm dressed. The watch seems fairly fast and the heart rate monitor, in my opinion, is extremely accurate. The watch is extremely customizable. And didn't take that long to set up. Battery life may not be as good as a Fitbit for example but still decent you get about 2 days if you set up the watch correctly. The touch bezel is very smooth and easy to use. I'm currently on a weight loss Journey and I'm about one-third of the way there and wanted to get a good Fitness watch. I'm telling you right now if you're into fitness don't hesitate to buy this. It works extremely well. Also before I forget the watch seems to be pretty waterproof. I actually showered for over 10 minutes with the watch on and had no issues when I got out. Just put water lock mode on so the screen can't be touched.

  So far, I like it a lot, but there's a lot to it that I haven't tried yet.  Two things that disappointed me:  the flower watch face they show in the pictures doesn't stay.  After wearing it 1 day, the watch face changed to one that resembled shifting sands in changing colors.  That was actually quite nice but some of the lighter colors made it difficult to read the time in white numerals. I searched all the watch faces shown on the watch and the app that goes with it, but I couldn't find the flower anywhere.  The other thing was the color of the band.  In the picture, it looked paler.  I was hoping for white, but it was grey.  That's on me because they did say it was grey, but I thought it would be a lighter shade.  In spite of those minor disappointments, it is a good watch and I would recommend it.

  There is much to like about this watch. It looks nice, the standard silicon strap it comes with is very comfortable, the Facer app is awesome....But it is incredibly difficult to figure out how to load and use most apps. The documentation it ships with lacks a lot;. A lot. A. LOT. And seeking clarification online is also, at best, like chasing shadows. My frustration level in using it from the beginning was very high. I did finally figure out most things, but it was a frustration.And equally as frustrating terrible as the Samsung-provided documentation is the usage of, basically, every app on it. There is no consistency with how they use the watch controls, there is no rhyme or reason about anything about this watch, and I literally hate it. Right now, it is a very pretty watch that tells me the time and date and temperature. Nice functions, for sure, but not worth $300. Not even nearly worth that.Even more frustrating, though, is the battery life. They claim it is good for two days. I guess, maybe, if you literally do nothing at all with the watch. But I doubt it would last even close to two days even if you did that.I wear it to bed -- I like the sleep tracking -- which means I have to charge it every single morning. Everything about the watch is quirky. Just as one (of dozens of examples): I turn my wrist to look at the watch. There's lots of pretty things on the display. But although I've adjusted the time it should stay on, it is really short and I have to do it 2 or 3 times to see all the data on face....except when I'm sleeping. I might roll over and it will light up really brightly and disturb me....and then stay lit for literally minutes.I truly hate this watch.

  I love how the Samsung watch connects directly to my Samsung phone. All my notifications come to the phone.

Only thing I was disappointed was the fact I'm left handed and I wear my watch on my right hand. It did not ask me what side I use my watch on like the Fitbit does, my only concern is that it could be missing some of my steps.

  Battery life is about 2 days. Display looks nice and crisp. I like continuous HR.  That's about it. Software is really terrible. The worst part is notifications. I want to see the new notification when it's received without touching or fiddling with the watch.  To add insult to injury after the notification is received, watch freezes for 5 seconds, nothing can be done, doesn't respond. Also having to press the side button to go back instead of having a back gesture is bad UX.

  This product supports apps, but almost nothing that you can't find on your phone, which is always on you and the battery life lasts longer on your phone.Pretty much all I do with this is wear it when I run to track steps and track my heartbeat.Note, I never have GPS or Bluetooth on and the battery barely lasts a day.If you must get a smart watch, get something cheaper, they all pretty much do the same thing.

  Be careful getting this watch from Amazon.  I have been trying to get the Samsung Health monitoring app and finally had to use a link I found on the internet to get it.  (It should have shown up in the galaxy store automatically, first red flag).  Second, once I did get it installed, it did show up in my galaxy store apps, however the app would not find my watch.  After scouring the internet trying to find a solution, I finally figured out the issue.  So it appears that my software version shows an ""XX"" in it.  After talking with Samsung customer service that software version is an international version.  The whole reason I got this watch was for the ecg monitoring that, at the time, was fda pending.  So here I am a year later with a watch that will not work with ecg/Samsung Health monitoring app.  Think Amazon will accept a return a year later? I doubt it.

  This is coming from a Fitbit versa user. I'm really loving this watch, however, comparing it to my Fitbit, there's a few things lacking with the active2. Nothing bad enough to make me regret my purchase, but enough to mention and hopefully they'll improve with the next model.. I already knew the battery life wasn't as great compared to the Fitbit, I read that from many other reviews. I thought it would still be worth it. However, most reviews did not mention how AWFULLY slow the charging is. Which means I either lose out on my sleep analysis if I have to charge it at night, or miss out on daytime use during the day. The battery life wouldn't be as bad if it didn't take an eternity to charge back up....Moving on, I wasn't expecting to need 2 apps on my phone, for all of my info. With the Fitbit app, your health info, and settings about the watch, etc, are all combined in 1 very user friendly app. With the Active2, there's a wearable app to control the watch settings, and another 'Samsung health' app that pairs with the watch and that's where you find that info. Not a dealbreaker, but something I wasn't expecting and not as sleek as being able to view everything all from 1 app to access. (Not to mention the extra storage that it takes up on your phone having 2 apps...)Also I've found that with only the bluetooth option, (at the time, I didn't think the LTE was necessary), that my bluetooth range to keep my phone paired, is not far AT ALL. With the fitbit I could be on the other side of my average sized house, still paired. With this I walk 2 rooms over and it notifies that it's out of range... the whole reason for upgrading was so that I could use my phone from my watch throughout my house/yard, but I'm not confident with this range, regretting not getting the LTE for this reason...Other than that so far I'm loving it.....

  I bought this over other watches because it claimed to have ecg. It does Not. It also has not 02 detection. Even the fitbit charge has this while sleeping. The vibration is not strong enough to notice if you are distracted which is disappointing and the battery sucks. The sleep data is wildly different then the data the fibfit shows. So i don't know which is more accurate.  Over all I feel disappointed in the amount I spent for what I got. Its pretty though and I like seeing my daughter on the customizable face.

  Battery life could be better. I have to charge it in a day or two depending on what I have on. If I have it on power saving mode it lasts for a few days. 5 at most. Maybe 6 or 7 if no notifications at all whatsoever. I have always been with Samsung for years. Love the color. Wish there was a better blue instead of cloud. Pink is cute too. Love being able to text on my watch without pulling my phone out. Checking the time too. That is also important. Big on me, really big. I can slip it off since I have small wrists and hands. It would be nice to have at least two more hole slots. I do like that the band goes inside so there isn't a flap always swinging around. The older versions didn't do that. A lot of functions on the watch that I don't even use, but it is cool that they have for people who do. Love the background customizations. There are hundreds to choose from, free and paid. The charger is so nice and small nice! Travel size. Does not come with a charging block though.

  BUYER BEWARE. NOT US VERSION. FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. NO SAMSUNG PAY ENABLED.The box label with serial numbers was in Spanish and was next to another label with the product information and said ""US Version"". The device booted in Spanish and changed to English after initial setup. According to Samsung, the Samsung Pay app is supposed to open when pressing and holding the top button for 1-2 seconds. After several hours of researching why this was not occurring, I found out this happens if you have a watch from specific non-US countries. Amazon will not let me exchange for the same item, so I have to exchange for the LTE version (which costs more money and with features needed in the first place).Regardless of whether this issue is resolved in the future, I feel this 1 star rating is warranted for the unnecessary frustration, wasted time, and false advertising.

  The watch states water resistant to 5ATM and safe for pools and salt water. I decided to check out the swim function.Put the watch into water safe mode and double checked that the water drop showed on the display. Got into the pool and took 2 arm strokes then noticed the display was flashing. ""Samsung Galaxy watch resetting"". I took the watch off and dried it. The flashing continued so I left it in the towel for 2 hours. When I picked it up the display was black.When I got home I put it on a charger. It charged to 100%. When removed from the charger the flashing continued for 30 minutes then stopped.I researched the water resistant problems and found many who have had the same thing happen when attempting to use the Galaxy active 2 for a swim workout. It seems that this is a common complaint. The Watch IS NOT water resistant as stated in the documtation.Samsung was called and they talked me through several things I'd already tried. I got a shipping label to return for repair.... according to them the watch had gotten wet!Add to that the warranty is invalidated if you get the watch wet! Then the repair costs over $220 if done by Samsung. A new watch costs between $199 and $279 depending on where it's purchased and ongoing sales.The Samsung service was no help. I was sent from one person/department to another and the conversation went in circles. You got it wet/I followed the instructions for water safe/ but you put it in water, it states the watch can be worn in pool for swimming, but you got it wet and that invalidated the warranty, but it says I can swim with it to track a workout, you got it wet..... I got the sense that each person was reading from the same scripted response card.In short the watch should not get wet. It is not water resistant. And costs as much to repair as a new watch.

  Samsung promised a lot of features on this watch, but failed to deliver as usual. Those advanced functions requires Samsung phone to work together.

You have to enable Samsung Text on your Samsung phone in order to get text notification.Of course, if you want to receive notifications from non-Samsung apps. Good Lucks! It may work, but just a simple notification. Most of time, it does not work. Even a stickers or a GIF in you chat app will not be delivered to watch.Samsung health is Ok, but this is the part the Samsung over promised a lot of functions and even it is there, it does not work well. I heard people with no Samsung phone cannot even get these advanced health functions. I am not sure why Samsung cannot put these apps in Google Play store instead. Probably those apps does not meet Google Play store standard and tracking too  many person info which it should not.Otherwise, I upgraded it from S2 watch so everything is good so far.

  So far I’m happy with it. I have a really small wrist so I was worried the watch would look bulky, but I think it looks great. (I got the 40mm). I have an iPhone so I can’t answer calls or text messages from the watch, but I had a fitbit before this watch that didn’t let me do that anyway, so I don’t really care about that feature. You’ll still get notifications that you’re getting a call or a text message and it’ll show you the message. I was just looking for a stylish, waterproof watch that would count my steps, and I don’t like the way the Apple Watch looks. I like a round, classic watch.The battery life is decent. I haven’t had the watch die on me yet but at a full charge I get probably a day and a half of battery. Of course, there are ways to save battery by turning WiFi and Bluetooth off, which is what I do. I just always charge my watch at night because I personally don’t really care about how well I slept (the watch has sleep tracking). I’ll know how well I slept when I wake up in the morning.I also really like how the watch faces are super customizable and there are so many free faces to choose from.The only complaint I have about the watch is that the bands that come with the watch are extremely hard to remove. I was chipping my nails trying to get it off. I have a leather band that I bought (not from Samsung but compatible w the watch) and it’s easy to take off when I want. However, the difficulty of removing the band could also be a good thing - as I stated earlier, I had a fitbit before this and the bands would break all the time so I could have lost my watch!

  The sleep tracker has never been accurate.  It never starts recording until after midnight.

Customer service wants to bill $219 to fix the issue. If you do a google search, you can find countless customers facing the same issue.

",5.0,Donnerstag,"Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2019","









  
  
    
  The Galaxy Watch Active2, is one of the best purchases that I've ever made in wearable technology. It delivers with more than adequate battery life, far superior comfort when compared to other products, a feature set that will appease most so-called ""Geeks"" such as myself, and the availability to add more features and/or applications via the Galaxy app store. The new customizable watch face feature makes the creation of customizable watch faces easy and simple. With just a snap of your clothing, and multiple watch faces are created for you that match your outfit. I also appreciate the much slimmer and sleeker design, when compared to the regular Galaxy Watch. With that, I can confidently say that (at least in my opinion) the Watch Active2 is the most fashionable, functional and flexible. (The Three Fs, as I call it.)  It is fashionable, due to its sleek glass, (in my case) aluminum housing, and unobtrusive thickness that is no thicker (if not, thinner) than your average premium analog watch.  It is functional, due to the fact that you have all the basic necessities that any digital watch should have PLUS, step tracking, workout tracking, heart rate monitoring, upcoming electrocardiogram capability, text messaging, the ability to accept, decline, and create phone calls, pay for things using Samsung pay, find your phone, the creation and cancellation of alarms and reminders, the ability to check the weather, and have music playback controls (also including track selection), just to name a few. (And I don't think I really need to explain why I think it's so flexible). 😉  And just to mention other things I love about the Watch Active2, I love the touch bezel (which is much better than you think it is), I love the SAMOLED display that by default automatically dims to fit the environment that it's in along with providing smooth animations, I love the now larger back button so you can tell that it's different if you're in the dark, I love the ability to triple click the apps/home button to send a message to your emergency contact(s), and so much more.  Now here's the part where I would usually explain the cons of the watch/device. But there was an issue, I struggled to come up with any. I would usually have a very long laundry list of cons, but I really don't have any. The only part I can say is a con, is that some people aren't satisfied with the accuracy of the health tracking features. Maybe it's just me, but I really haven't had any. The lack of feminine health tracking might be a con to some women, but I'm not female, so... That doesn't apply to me... That's all I can really say.  So in the end, if you are currently looking for a smartwatch to go with your Android device, then I say you should absolutely go with this one. It has many a feature that the competition do not supply, has great battery life, a digital rotating bezel that is the best way to interact with it, a decent amount of customization, and health tracking that I believe to be accurate. (Disclaimer: I am not a health professional by any means, and therefore I am not the first person you should listen to when it comes to advice about health tracking). So, I say it is a very worthy purchase. And I am enjoying my time with it.(Leather watch band pictured: Fullife hybrid Coffee Suede Leather watch band)(Screen protector pictured: LK [6-Pack] TPU)

However I work in a school, and am often using this to not only check the time, but I can also check my emails call or use my text messaging. It also tells me how active I've been during the day. I definitely did my research before purchasing any watch. This was definitely the best one for any Android phone! I also compared sizes and went for the smaller one. I am a female and the larger one looked too big for my wrist, but it can vary for others. I bought 2 watches. I especially appreciate how discrete they are when you are in a meeting. You can get important notifications without appearing rude.

  Using a Pixel phone and galaxy watch active 2 Bluetooth since Feb 2020. When the watch works it is easily a 4 star product.PROS (When you can maintain connection to your phone)-Watch is quick and fairly responsive-touch bezel works well and does a great job-style is great and you can add bezel covers-samsung pay works well-golf apps available and work very well, very pleasantly surprised by thisCONS-At some point in the last 5 weeks my watch has had problems maintaining connection to the phone and/or apps. Due to the lost connection, the watch constantly looks for a connections and lasts 12 hours most-Touch to wake and lift to wake are frustrating. Often I find myself swinging my arm up trying to see the time only to find myself tapping on the screen 3 times to wake it up-Always on Dislpay uses a lot of battery. It is also a bit misleading. If you set a timer with AOD on, after inactivity, the screen AOD will show the watchface, not the timer.This watch would be 4/5 stars if the battery/connection issues are resolved. The last 2 Cons are a bit nitpicky but battery life and connection for notifications, etc. is what i bought this watch for. If it will not last a full day and have extreme trouble connecting this is an expensive piece of metal on my wrist.

    Very expensive dud...
  
",1.0,April D.,"Reviewed in the United States October 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  Within a month of receiving, the screen started going green as in the picture. The watch would randomly flash on and off all night. I could not sleep with the watch on.I started charging it by my bedside at night, but it would wake itself up and flash thru apps as if it was being used.  It did this every night, all night.I started wearing it only during the day, but it continued to act up, difficult to get it to switch apps and it always randomly changed watch faces. I stopped wearing it and left it on it's original charger. When I would try to wear it, it didn't act right-I always had to change the watch face back, fight with the apps to work, alarms going off when I never set them...really random stuff, so I gave up.I left it on the charger for a couple days and went back to check it and saw that it was ""rebooting""... When I would remove it from the charger, it would have about 15% battery, even after days on the charger.  A hard restart of the watch did nothing to change it.I left it on the charger and when I would walk by, it was still flashing the ""rebooting"" screen, but never did anything from there. Couldn't do anything with it. Sometimes it wouldn't even turn on at all even after being on the charger.I reached out to Samsung and everything the tech suggested, I had already tried, so I sent it to them.  Mind you, at this point, I only had the watch for about 4 months.  They send me an email stating that it is ""out of warranty"" and will cost $219.00 to fix... On a watch I just spent $250.00 to BUY.  No, thanks.  I don't like it $470 worth.  Sure, I got a dud, but I won't ever be buying this watch again.

  Everywhere you read this is the best smart watch for android users, total BS, it may be if you have a Galaxy phone. Nothing works, you don't get the best features because you don't have a Samsung phone, it keeps disconnecting from my phone, sometime it reminds me to stand up sometimes it doesn't, sometime you get notifications, sometimes you don't. After a couple of months the case is full of scratches, the screen is really tough though.Half baked, very disappointed. Samsung probably got Apple a new customer.

    So Disappointed
  
",3.0,Scout88,"Reviewed in the United States October 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  Maybe I got a defective one.  I've used it for 3 weeks, and it's never seemed right.Sleep tracking is a joke.  I usually read for an hour (or more) in bed before falling asleep; the watch thought I was asleep the whole time, every night.  I wake up frequently, most nights, and stare at the clock, tossing and turning; it thought I was asleep the whole time, sometimes REM, sometimes Deep.  I got up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom and went back to sleep for 4 hours; the watch thought I stayed up, didn't detect those 4hrs, even though it was within my target sleep window.  Constant heart rate reading is On, but it doesn't seem to make a difference.Stay Active, move reminder, whatever Samsung calls it, where it nags you to get up and move:  Nope.  I watched a 2+ hour movie and it never nagged me to move.  Several times, 5min after sitting down from being active for an extended period, it said I needed to move.  And upon agreeing to do stretches or squats, it failed to detect my motion.  Upward Stretch, Torso Twist, Squats... the watch detected me doing 1 or 2 (if at all), when I had done  10+ (slowly and deliberately, waiting, watching, begging for it to detect, flipping my wrist this way and that way).  I'm not a fit person; walking and stretching are my limit, at the moment, and I need the nagging to keep me moving.  I'm rather sedentary (I'm trying not to be!), but it only nagged me 2-3 times a day, instead of every hour for 10-12hrs a day as I expected.  Yes, I can just set an alarm on my phone, or a kitchen timer even, but what's the fun in that?I have nearly every permission enabled (except Contacts; don't need any social junk thank you) for both the watch and the apps on my Samsung S9, but it just doesn't sense things like I expect it should, after many exhaustive, positive reviews I read, from many sources.I was also disappointed with the bluetooth range.  My house is small, but going from the kitchen to the bedroom it loses connection; too many walls maybe, but my bluetooth earbuds don't have a problem.  So I still have to cart my phone from room to room while I'm cleaning, doing laundry, etc. (my summer weight pants don't have pockets; winter is jeans, so no big deal, but for half the year, I'd hoped to not have to drag my phone around in my own house).The watch is Beautiful, the build feels solid, the display is crisp and bright, and far more comfortable to wear than I expected (once I bought a few tapered straps to go with it).  The apps (Wear and Health) are easy to use and worked seamlessly with my Galaxy S9.  I am almost heartbroken at returning this watch, but since it just doesn't perform the way I expected it should, doesn't perform the basic functions I need, and makes me feel rather sick at the cost for not doing all it should, I'm returning it.  I may try another unit, but I feel a bit soured on it at this point.

  This has got to be my favorite watch I've ever had, my roommate who has an apple watch was jealous of how nice this screen is, the super AMOLED is beautiful, and the 44mm is the perfect size, I really love it, beats any Wear OS Smart Watch on the market right now, I have a Pixel 4 and it works great with it. I still can't over how good this watch looks, and the band is amazing too, I was going to buy a leather band for it cause I typically prefer leather bands but I think I'm going to stick with the original, it's very comfortable and looks great. Also I bought this used front the Amazon wear house and it came in the original packaging with everything and looks brand new so I'm beyond impressed. If you have any doubts buy this watch, trust me when I say it will be your favorite, cause it's mine. Oh yeah and I get atleast 2 days of battery life even when I use it a fair amount.

  UPDATE: Since I have been using this watch there are MAJOR problems with it.  The Back Sensor Cover FELL OFF with in 30 days of use.  This is a VERY WELL KNOWN DEFECT with this product.  After hours on the phone with Amazon and then Samsung I was able to send it to Samsung to have it repair for free.  The process of sending my watch to Samsung for repair was very fast and easy.  The watch came back to me with in 2 weeks and it was repaired.Last week September 6th, 2020 the EXACT same PROBLEM happened again.  Back Sensor Battery Cover just FELL OFF again.  I called Samsung and was got help from a customer service member pretty quick.  The agent said my watch will be sent to Repair Department and a Manager will call me to discuss the problem with my watch by either Replacing it with a New watch or a Full Refund since this is a second service on the EXACT SAME PROBLEM.  However, NO ONE CALLED me.  They just repaired it and wanted to charge me $88 dollars for the repair which I DID NOT Authorized.I called Samsung immediately to let them know that proper communication was not provided to me from Repair Management team.  I got the chance to talk to Management expressing my concern about the watch.  Samsung will be providing me a NEW REPLACEMENT watch.  I just really hope that I will not run into the same issue again with a new unit.  I really do enjoy having the Samsung Active 2 Watch.I might just trade in the new unit to the Galaxy Watch 3 Titanium model launching in October.  I will do some research about the performance of the Watch 3 and if there are any on going problems with the new model.I didn't really know or expect anything from this watch.  Since the quarantine I have been walking a lot and my phone was not always accurate in tracking my steps.  This watch have help me really focused on my step counts and other functions such as water, coffee.  Not sure how accurate the sleep monitor is or the hear rate monitor, since I have nothing to compare it to.  I enjoy this watch, I have not worn a watch since high school lol

  Seriously, no one buys a Smartwatch and expects it to be a medical device, but the one basic thing it should do is accurately track things based off of the formulas.I weigh 220 lbs. If I walk 1000 steps, I should burn 60 calories. This watch says I burn 42. I have everything programmed and setup properly, but it does not compute the formula correctly. This is the most BASIC function. Good smartwatches take your heart rate O2 level GPS speed into account to approximate burned calories. This watch does not seem to do that.So it is really hard to get an understanding of your true active level above BMR. That is what I am looking for in a smartwatch. It's hard to recommend the product because of this.App store is woefully small. Samsung is gaining marketshare in the wearables space, so it would be really nice to see them approaching and paying for app development. No Nest, No Pocketcase, No Automotive Apps (FordPass), No Audible. Because of this, my phone has to be with me to workout. I'd rather download a Podcast and leave the phone at home.Fit and Finish is very nice. I like the velcro bands and I have one coming shortly. I like the universal band style which makes it easier to swap. The digital crown is really nice and useful once you get use to it.Update 3/3 - 1 more starI just got my Galaxy Phone. There is a new setting in Samsung Health to track activity on both my phone and watch together. When enabled, I see activity numbers more in-line with what my Apple Watch tracked. Not 1 for 1, but better than just the watch alone. Given these all can be off by as much as 50%, I consider that a pass. However, it definitely shows that the watch itself is NOT a fitness tracker.

",3.0,Nathaniel A Mueller,"Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  TL;DR version: Product only full works if paired with a Samsung phone.  The watch itself offers the basic features of almost any off the shelf smartwatch of today. For the price tag though, you're not buying any smartwatch, you're buying one of the only smartwatches for the android ecosystem that offers that ECG feature. That is what much of the marketing will inform you, of course, however, this comes with a very big asterisk. You see Samsung is very happy that you purchased their watch, but they would be even happier if you also bought one of their phones as well, that is why they lock this key feature (and several other smaller features) behind an arbitrary software wall.  I'm sure if I was more tech-savvy, or knew someone with a proper amount of coding knowledge there is likely a simple back door that would enable the hardware to do its job, all the components are there after all, but the simple answer for me was to just return it. I can't say that I'm not disappointed, the product could really be something if the company in charge wasn't so underhanded.  I know that many individuals say impotent statements such as this and it always sounds trite and silly to me, but for what it's worth: Samsung I know you're intent was to force me to buy more of your products, but instead, I will do my best now to stay away from any Samsung purchase. Please try to treat your current customers better, I'm sure many are fine people who don't deserve such dishonest business practices.

  I like the watch a lot - first time with a smart watch. I have a Samsung phone so it was easy to set up. Get a screen protector right away if you do buy the watch. I scratched mine within the first month. I will say it's disappointing that Samsung Health doesn't offer a HIIT workout to choose, but they have badminton, I think. Even yoga. I do like the automatic step detection and counting, but their workout tracking is off. I swam open water about for 1 hour and it said I swam a total of 400 yards so that's off by a lot. I also do a lot of jumping rope and the calorie count is off, but I don't care so much about that. I connect to the phone only a couple times/week to save battery. I also don't have email setup on the phone bc I don't want the  notifications.Update on swimming. In order for it to track a swim workout correctly,  you must choose lap or outdoor. It does track laps quite well, but if you kick with a kickboard, it doesn't track it. Nor does it track one arm butterfly well. And once I selected outdoor swimming,  it tracked it closely to a friend's apple watch.

  20 Mar 20 Update, still like the function of the watch other than the fact after only 4 months of use the battery life has gone from about 2 days before charges to only about 6 hours with minimal use. Knowing this, I would not have bought it.***********I've been a huge iPhone fan for years and also had the Apple watch 3 with dedicated line to go with my iphone 7. Due to frustration with not getting call and texts on both my phone and watch I decided to take the leap to android and traded in my iPhone 7 for a Galaxy Note 10+ and purchased the Galaxy Active 2 smart watch.1st the Pros for the watch: I found it to be a mutch brighter and easier to read display. I love how easy it is to customize the display and the huge range of display options. The battery life is unbelievable. I charge it about every 2 days which is longer than they advertise. The round shape I like better than the square apple watch in which I'd always accidentally hit the side buttons if I bent my wrist to far back.The negatives: It hardly has any compatible apps. Or if it does, I haven't figured out how to get the same ones I had on my apple watch on my Galaxy watch. I think the Apple watch had a wider bluetooth range as it stayed connected to my phone throughout my entire home and my Galaxy Active 2 disconnected about halfway through my house.My opinion: I've had the Galaxy watch now for about a month now and am still learning new things about it. I don't miss the apps that I had on my apple watch at all because i felt they were pretty worthless anyway and was easier to just use my phone. I think the Galaxy Active 2 is easier to use, my calls are louder and much more clear, my texts are easier to read and respond to, it's much more useful and fun, and its cheaper than the Apple watch. I didn't get the dedicated line with mine but it is an option.My wife stayed with Apple and upgraded her phone to the iPhone 11 and stayed with the Apple watch, but after seeing and playing with my phone and watch, she wishes she would have gotten the same.I'm by no means anti-Apple. I for the 1st time in a long time bought a windows PC and I don't believe it is anywhere close to as good as my mac or my macbook, but it will be a long time before I decide to try another iPhone or Aplle watch again.

  TLTR: FALSE ADVERTISING.  IT'S NOT WATER RESISTANT. Don't buy it if you're planning on living a normal life.I have been a Samsung Galaxy phone user since 2012. I used to proudly say that I hated iphones and Samsung was better.I bought this watch to complement my galaxy phone. I went running with it and tracked my fitness activities. I loved that I had whastapp and I received and response notiications. I compared it with my friend who had the apple watch, and although very similar, I thought Samsung was better when tracking and responding. The calories seem to be off but it picked up my steps and activities even when i forgot.The apps are OK. I sticked to the basic and I was learning how to use it. Turning on and off notifications as needed and figuring it out. It takes a bit to get used to it.It was all good until I mistakenly took a shower with it. The watch is allegedly water resistant and can track swimming. Well, all false advertisement.  After the shower the touch screen was messed up. I sent it to Samsung as it had only been a few months. I sent it for repair,  and I was expecting a quick fix, it was almost new. Instead I received a $229 bill. Mind you, Ibought the watch for that amount. The Reason, it was out of warranty because water damage. At this point, in tears because this was my birthday present,  I called Samsung, spoke with a nice lady but nothing was done. It was deemed and so was I.Clearly Samsung doesn't care about its customers, but I'm moving on, my new appliances will not be Samsung and my next phone will either be an iphone or a Google Pixel. I'm very dissatisfied with the product and with the brand.UPDATE,  they called me and offered me to repair it for $75, ultimately I'm pissed but I paid it. I'm still mourning.

  The watch is branded as IP68 however, there is no possibility to claim warranty with Samsung if there is water damaged. It doesn't matter if you never submerged the watch in water. I spend 1 month claiming the warranty but it wasn't possible. Plus, the reparation cost is impossible, just $15 less than the watch new.For a lower price you can buy a nice Huawei sport watch with the same Samsung warranty.Anyway, if you still want this watch I recommend you not to use it for any water related activity,, even when there is a swimming mode 🤷🏻‍♂️

(apparently the Blaze design has a weakness in skew flexing of the housing?)So far I am liking it.It does have some problems and drawbacks.Battery life - so far it seems like it is about the same as my old Blaze : 2-3 days. I'm still playing with some of the settings which I'm sure will impact battery life such as the wifi being enabled/disabled.App - Fitbit has Samsung stomped on this. They have a single app. For this device you have to have the Gear app PLUS the Samsung Health app. Really???Stairs - If you're looking for something to count stairs go find a different product. This thing not only doesn't count stairs accurately, it rarely if ever counts stairs. Not a deal breaker for me but a LOT of people have complained about this and NONE of the ""solutions"" work. (The documentation hints that it takes climbing 10+ feet to trigger one ""stairs"" count but a lot of people say even then it doesn't count).The only thing I cannot comment on yet is an experience with riding a motorcycle. The Fitbit would count thousands of steps and hundreds of flights of stairs while riding but I have not ridden since getting this. I'll look to update once I have and can see what happens.

    Great smartwatch

  This replaced a Fitbit Ionic which I really liked. I really wanted a smartwatch just to use for notifications and catch calls when I couldn't hear or feel my phone vibrate. This watch has worked flawlessly for that. I also like the selection of watch faces in the Samsung app. There's probably thousands to choose from. I can get through a couple of days on the battery without a charge. It's also very comfortable and light. One neat thing it does is when you receive a text and you turn the watch toward you it will automatically show the text message without having to tap or swipe the screen. I really don't have any negatives to say about it.

  I bought the all-black version of the Samsung Galaxy Watch Active 2.  I wasted money on an extra watch band:  I didn't need it because the band that comes with the watch is perfect:  comfortable, waterproof, and looks nice.  I read reviews that said this watch was almost as good as the Galaxy Watch 3, and that has turned out to be true.  This watch is much less expensive and works just fine.  Setup is very easy using the Galaxy Wearable app on my phone.The coolest feature is the ability to answer phone calls on my watch, and it works REALLY well!  Also, I like the hourly chime, which my last smart watch didn't have.  My first experience with a smart watch was the Moto 360 ... that didn't go so well.  I ended up returning it and got this one instead.  I am really happy with the decision, as I love this Galaxy Active 2 smart watch.

    No water damage issues
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2021","









  
  
    
  Purchased in December '20 and have been using every day since then. No issues what so ever. Upgraded from the regular active (pictured in 40mm rose gold for size comparison), that I constantly had issues with disconnecting on its own, happy to say this does not have that problem. As to the water damage reported in other reviews- It freaked me out and I didn't purchase this for a long time because of it. I finally decided to and was so careful to not get it wet. Eventually I stopped caring. I went to Sea World and pet dolphins and sting rays with this on my dominant hand. Fully submerged in salt water, with the water lock on, and it has not affected it one bit. Ive washed my dogs outside with the hose, without the water lock, no issues there. Also no corrosion or turning. Perplexed as to why there were so many issues reported but understand the variance of quality control. The only thing I dont like about this is how long the band is (pictured wrapped around my wrist). I wish they would have included a smaller size, as I purchased the 44mm for the larger face, and only the large band was included. Also the ECG is now an active feature and I'm super happy to play with that. Its too big and bulky to wear to sleep (pictured compared to 40mm), but I track my heart rate and activity (fitness regimine and heart problems), the period tracker i feel like should have a few more options to select, but they give you an area to write notes so that makes up for it. Find my phone, of course, was the original reason I started using Galaxy watches and it works flawlessly as well. So pleased with my purchase, I have already bought a 40mm on a data line for my kid to use when we go to theme parks and split up.

  Full suite of features that work very well. I track hr, sleep and stress full time. Has an emergency feature to notify one selected person of where you are at all times and if you've fallen/been in an accident. If this function is active, it uses GPS on watch and this KILLS the battery life. I only turn on for bike rides. Be prepared to charge 3x/day. With hr/stress/sleep and GPS turned off,, i charge 1x day 1 and 2x day 2. Seems to use less battery in my case when adjusted pretty snug (yet still comfortable) on wrist. Very wide selection of watch faces and color combinations to customize as you like. Samsung needs to allow GPS readings from connected phone when bt or wifi connected to conserve battery. Since there are quite a few negative reviews as to water damage, I have chosen to not even test this (closest it comes to water is handwashing and sweating, and i haven't used the water setting yet). The charging dock is a good design and magnetic so it doesn't require delicacy to get watch on dock. Does take 80-90 minutes from dead to full charge (I use a Samsung fast charger). If you have a Samsung account, when you first connect and activate watch, warranty is already in place on your account. Overall very useful for my needs of hr tracking. Star removed for poor battery life when desired features are used and inability to use GPS from connected phone. (For clarification i have a Samsung Note 9. It should be easy to make GPS connection work at least within their own lines, if not all Android platforms.)It is comfortable to wear and not over-sized (44mm model) on my wrist. I will stick with the band supplied as it is supple and the excess tucks underneath instead of over and a loop to secure. Definately better than leather or metal choices in my opinion.

  I was very excited about my watch for about the first 4 months. And then it started ""acting up"". It would not hold tracking a workout. When I started the workout tracking it would last at best 2 mins and then just stop. I contacted the service people and they suggested a factory reboot. I did that and it worked for about another month and then the same thing started happening again. This time maybe even worse.... at times it won't even hold the tracking for 15 secs. All the other features are working fine, but not this one. I am very disappointed as I really like tracking my HR and mins of a workout. Not sure what I will end up doing, likely seeing if they will make good on the warranty.

  I was wanting a more robust smart watch to replace my Amazfit. The Galaxy Active 2 watch is exactly what I was looking for. It looks nice, not to large (ordered the 40mm version), and has so many bells and whistles for the money. The fitness tracking is great, I love the way it integrates into their app. Setup was super easy. The notifications are great, it's nice to get get sms, email, weather, and app notifications at just a swipe. There are also some great screen protectors out there that cover the entire face of the watch so you can change the color quickly and not worry about scratching the watch. I now have gotten into creating my own watch faces with the Samsung Watch Maker app, it is so simple to be able to upload a new face to fit the mood.

  I have been looking for a smart watch that is somewhat small. The active 2 comes in a 40mm size. Although still a little bigger then I wanted, the round face helps the size seem smaller. The active 2 paired seamlessly with the S9 phone. The apps connected with the watch are easy to use and can be rearranged and removed or added depending on what you want. The watch faces are customizable so you can make the phone fit your style. Notifications are easy to receive and answer. The active 2 also has lots of accessories like watch bands and screen protectors. I would recommend this watch.

",4.0,Arlene Wolfe,"Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  I really like the watch. I am still learning how to control the mobile app functions so it doesn't spit out my battery time. I put a pic of a measuring tape on my wrist along with the 40 mm watch so y'all can see what I couldn't prior to buying it...the size of the watch on my SMALL wrist. I sleep comfortably with it, heart rate is in line with what my fitbit ""was"", sleep tracking is as well. The main issue I have is the step count is about 18% low. I have a short stride, due to physical issues, and there is nowhere I can find to manually enter my stride length to get an accurate step count, SO I just reduced my 10000 step goal down to 8200 steps per day. If I ever figure out the samsung health app, I'll amend my review. If you run the map my fitness app with the watch, it counts the same exercise (in my case, walk) twice on the samsung app. The stand alone Spotify app completely shuts off when you get notifications. I will get accustomed to the watch and learn as I go as there is no instruction book...only the internet...sometimes it is easier to flip pages rather than hit the back button...just sayin!

  Bought the watch thinking it'd work on a normal Android device as advertised but the Samsung Health app has an issue where you login only to be greeted with an infinite loading screen. Samsung KNOWS about the issue but their only solution is to ""clear the app cache"" which didn't work. Community solutions ended up being download an old APK which shouldn't be a solution due to security risks from downloading APKs from a third party.  There's no point in owning this watch if I can't have any of the data properly saved and tracked in-app. Why even have the app available to download if it isn't going to be compatible?

For ECG, I purchased an “Omron Complete” (combination ECG & BP Monitor)  that works well for EKG.

  It has all the basic features you'd expect of the smart watch like Heart rate monitor, being able to take or make a call, calculate burned calories during workout, etc.Pros:1.It's reasonably priced. I paid $200 for 44mm Bluetooth model which is noticeably cheaper than apple watch Series 5, yet I hate to admit it, but it's not as good and convenient as the apple product.2.Light weight. I don't really notice its weight on my wrist.3.Battery life is decent for it's weight and size. Usually lasts me around 2 days.4.Nice looking design.5.Colorful and bright screen (the resolution is a bit too low though).Cons:1. Very limited apps. It's not an android the watch is running on, so there is a very limited selection of apps that you can use, most of which you also need to pay for.2. No notifications for apps like Viber, Telegram, Messenger, Skype (probably because there is no app that can be installed on the watch). You can read text messages and outlook emails (not gmail emails though) perfectly fine. The problem is I can check my watch for all notifications and think that I've read it all, but I still could have a missed message on Viber on my phone, and the watch will not show it.3. Selection of workouts is not as good as on Samsung phone even though it should be the same health app.4. Low resolution screen. You could definitely see pixels on the 44mm model screen. I guess I just expected a little better from the company that has the edge in display manufacturing. It's not terrible though. You can still read all the texts perfectly fine.5. Blood pressure monitor is a joke. It's very inaccurate and only can be used as a toy.6. Sometimes the watch lags a little bit (not to much, so not a big deal)7. Bixby is okay, but not as good as Siri or Google Assistant.Overall it's worth the money, but don't expect it to be as good as Apple Watch 5 series which was released at about the same time.

    ""Gently Used??""
  
",3.0,Michelle,"Reviewed in the United States May 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  From the moment I opened my ""new watch"" I questioned whether I had received an ""almost new"" item.  The inside packaging where the charger was housed appeared to have been previously opened. I shrugged it off as, ""maybe a quality check."" I then powered on my ""new watch""... the screen instructions were in Spanish! Hmmm, that's odd, for that to be the FIRST language displayed. So I accepted the reality that this was probably a return. I didn't really feel like going thru the hassel of a return, so I completed setup and immediately fell in love with the watch itself. The fit was perfect, set up was easy and the hardest decision for me was ""which watch face"" I liked best. Then, two days later as I sat in the bright sun, I noticed for the first time deep scratches on the edge of the dark screen. That was the final straw! This ""return"" was getting returned! The 3 star rating is for Amazon sending me a used item as new. In their defense they have said they will send out another one immediately. I will revisit my rating when it arrives.

  Worked flawless for 5 months, then one function after another stopped.  Returned it to Samsung for warranty repair.  Samsung said it was the motherboard and operating system problem.  Samsung would not cover it under warranty due to water damage.  I never had this watch in water and besides it is supposed to be waterproof.  Also be sure to check other buyers with this exact same problem.  Should be a class action lawsuit against Samsung.BUYER BEWARE

  I love this watch! I purposely waited a while to write this review so I could use the watch and I love it! Im not an excercise person. But still love the step counter and BPMs the watch provides. I use the timer often too. Ive talked on this watch and Ive been told the clarity is great. Texting is hard to do, but I like that I can get texts. I would recommend getting a face protector. I had hit it a few times when I just purchased it. Lots of great choices on Amazon to dress this watch up. The band is comfortable. I got it dirty while working outside, easy to clean up too. The watch faces can be changed and personalized which is fun. Overall I love this watch.

So many ways to upgrade this smartwatch. I'm very happy so far with my decision. Almost forgot to mention I'd purchased this as a bundle. So it came with samsung galaxy buds plus.

  I love this smartwatch, but...I had a Fitbit Versa prior to getting the Samsung Galaxy Active 2.  I could go 3, sometimes 4 days between charges.  In my first few days of using the Galaxy Active 2, I had to recharge it less than 24 hrs after giving it a full charge.  I did some research as to what I could do to prolong the battery life.  When I made a few tweaks, I can now get almost 2 full days out of each charge.There are so many ways to customize almost everything about the smartwatch.  Find what works for you and it will be your favorite as well.

  At first the watch was great. I will say my first complaint was the battery life was horrible. I say was because I have returned this watch.I noticed after purchasing this watch the the step count was never correct, and the battery life sucked (literally). Having worn this watch daily for almost 3 months I started having some issues with my left arm with pins and needles feeling from my elbow to my finger tips. I didn't think anything of it. I just figured my shoulder or elbow was out if place. I was wrong. I took the watch off to charge it one night and realized the issues went away. I tested it out again after charging and the issues returned. I thought the was no way possible my watch could be causing this! I turned to Google thinking I wouldn't find anything about this and I found page upon page of complaints with this same issue. And they weren't all with the Active 2 watch. It was across the whole watch line. Since taking the watch off completely last week I have noticed some other issues I was having going away. My heart rate has even dropped back into it's normal range. Of course these were all issues on my left side since that's the arm I wore the watch on.I'm not sure what the deal is, or what caused these issues to happen with my watch. All I know is I am glad I figured out there was an issue with this watch, and that my issues are now fixing themselves.People purchase these types of watches to track our health and activities, not to cause health issues. Be careful with the Samsung Active 2.

  For a smart watch it is good, notifications, apps, and ability to store music is nice. BUT it does not accurately track steps, calories, or stairs/flights. It only notifies you if you have been in active for 50 minutes, no reminders about steps per hour or ability to set it up. Very disappointed considering its supposed to be a fitness watch. That being said for a smart watch its good but not fitness.

  tl;dr I loved this watch until I wore it while wading in the water and it broke.  Samsung said that water damage voided warranty.  Now I'm buying a Garmin.  Didn't last a year.I bought this watch (the 44mm version) over 6 months ago and loved it.  I'm a fairly loyal Samsung customer so it seemed to fit nicely with everything.  Battery life was great; if I did not use the ""always on"" I could charge it while driving to/from work and keep a full charge easily.  Notifications were great; it meant that I could keep my phone on vibrate and not fear missing a message.  I rarely used many of the ""smart"" features of the watch - I tried using it to reply to a message a few times and it did not work out well, but I did not expect much either.As far as fitness tracking - the sleep tracking was interesting. I found that it tracked the duration of time I was asleep relatively acurately (although it could get fooled if I was just laying in bed quietly) but would sometimes catch my afternoon nap too and include that.  No idea about its accuracy re: REM/deep/light sleep, but I wouldn't put much stock in it.  Step counting was great.  I loved using it for workouts.I loved the vibrating alarm clock.  Maybe a stupid thing to love on a smart watch, but it vibrated well enough that it could wake me and not my wife.  Pretty awesome!As I said, I loved it.  I wore it nearly always.  I never took it off in the shower.  I swam in it a few times without problems - the product is reportedly water resistant to 50m.  It advertises swimming tracking for heaven's sake!  So one day I waded in the ocean with it on, not thinking twice.  Emphasis is on wading - barely submerged.  Afterwards it began to malfunction and eventually died.I sent it back to Samsung, however after diagnosing it they informed me that water damage is not covered by the warranty.  I think that this is incredible - if the product is used within its advertised limits, they ought to repair it.  However, such is not the case.Since it did not even last a year, I will not be purchasing another.  I'm looking into Garmin products, and hope that they will last; unlike this product.

  The speech to text is horrendous and rarely understands me, I said probably and it added promenade.  Not very good at tracking what's most likely the word we are looking for.  It's texting is alright at best but it consistently doesn't know what an a or e are.  I've talked to friends who have other galaxy watches and they're experiencing the same thing.  Looking like its just Samsung.  I would recommend buying a different watch because even the auto exercise tracking hardly works.  It's better than no watch, but not as good as the more expensive ones I'm sure.

  I decided to switch up my iphone X for a samsung galaxy note 10, therefore rendering my apple watch useless. I can honestly say I don't miss my apple watch very much! I use this watch primarily for fitness purposes and so far I am really enjoying it. It is comfortable, stylish, and I like the round shape a lot better than the iwatch. The iwatch used to hurt the small bone of my wrist because of the sqaure design. The only reason why I am rating it 4 stars is because it bugged out when I was first setting it up for a few hours. Mainly because I started a watch software update accidentaly during setup. The screen basically went black without any response. I honestly was upset, however I was able to reset to factory settings and I have not had any issues ever since!

  I hope you really love Samsung if you buy this watch, because that's all you will be able to install on this watch.There is no app store and no apps from google can be installed on it.And for music you better use Spotify because I was not able to install any other app either like Apple Music or Deezer, so no music downloads for you unless you use Spotify.Oh and do you want voice assistant? Here you go, use Bixby and ONLY BIXBY. The only way to use google assistant is to use a third party and giving them access to your google cloud services, so no thanks.If you're really a Samsung loving guy go ahead, you'll love this watch with a lot of un-installable Samsung apps, otherwise just get a Wear OS watch or a simpler hybrid watch.

  This is my first smart watch ever. It's an excellent watch functionality, esthetically, & practically. I am happy with my purchase. Battery life is more than enough for me. I usually place it on the charger every night or every other night as a habit & not because it's running out of juice. The heart rate measurement is surprisingly accurate; it matched the reading done by the nurse on a recent doctor visit. One limitation is that I can't get an ECG trace yet awaiting a software update. Also, the free watch faces are limited. Samsung should make more available.Overall it's a great purchase.

  After ""upgrading"" to the galaxy active 2 from the Fitbit versa, it has been very disappointing. The decision was based on connectivity issues with the versa. The versa would've gotten 5 stars when new but ended with 3.5. That is neither here nor there for this review. The active 2 looks great, has a traditional round watch design, and is a great sleep tracker. The number of watch faces available is very nice and will probably meet most everyone's individual tastes. The step tracker does not seem to be accurate. I have not measured it but it seems to under count steps. The user interface is where this watch is very disappointing. The touch screen is slow to react so at times it is hard to tell if it will respond or didn't get the touch command. It is also easy to inadvertently go into various aspects of the watch by mistake. Half the time the screen won't wake up without tapping it even if you roll your arm like it is supposed to. The battery life is fair and will regularly last 3 days between charges but I am a light user and do not run a bunch of apps through it. The slow and nonreactive at times UI is the reason this only gets 3 stars instead of 4 or 5.

  I would rate this watch between a 3.5 to 4. It has great features for receiving notifications and using your voice to reply back to messages. What it truly lacks is tracking your workouts. It does not have all the workout features that you would find on Samsung Health on your phone. If you do kickboxing, HIIT, etc then this is where the watch is useless. It can not track any of those and using the other workouts is a joke. If you are looking for a watch that can track your workouts then look at Fitbit, Garmin, or Apple. You would think that Samsung would want to compete with Apple and offer all of the options that Apple has but it has failed hard. So before buying this watch you need to consider what you are going to use it for. I hate having to wear my phone to be able to track my workouts.

  Looking for a smartwatch at a reasonable price? Well, what are you waiting for? This smartwatch checks all the boxes at almost half the price of an Apple Watch and as someone who has used both, I would go with this one. Both the built quality and software is one of the best on the market, and the price is more than reasonable. The apps available on the phone and on the watch itself is more than enough to satisfy your needs and the many customizable factors of the software is amazing. As someone who prefers to pay for products that can do more for a lesser price (I mean, who doesn't?), I would go for this watch even as an IOS user. Plus, it looks amazing as well! If you're torn between the Galaxy Watch 3 and this, I would go with this one and probably wait until Samsung releases another watch that is far ahead of both just like I did. Don't hesitate and make your purchase especially on the sale price right now, and you won't be disappointed.

  Do not buy this product.Again for those in the back.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.Samsung advertises this as a waterproof smartwatch....there is even a swim mode for lap tracking and the like. HOWEVER, after being in the pool with mine for 5 minutes, it locked out and shut down, completely unresponsive to touch, charge, or any button pressing ""soft reset"". When you call customer service, their response is ""no electric device is truly waterproof, so since you admitted to getting it wet, it isn't covered under warranty"". When I asked for a supervisor, I was hung up on. DO NOT BUY THIS WATCH, or frankly anything from Samsung. I am appalled at the complete disregard for a customer spending hundreds of dollars on a watch that lacks basic functionality which is literally advertised directly on the box.Thankfully Amazon values their customers and is processing a refund for me, a clear example of a company standing by what they sell, and a stark contrast to the complete disregard Samsung has for customers who have already handed over their money. I have to say I will never purchase another Samsung product, if it doesn't hold true to basic functionality which is clearly stated on the box, I can not trust anything they say for their products going forward.

  I like this watch. It is not a Fitbit which does well at tracking health and activity. Its a smartwatch trying to be a fitness watch. However it does its best at both. With Future updates I'm hopeful.. I'd recommend  as it does what its supposed to except floors. Still doesn't work.

    Bad Battery Life. Not worth it in my opinion
  
",1.0,Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is my first smart watch and tbh i think spending over $100 for a watch is VERY expensive let alone $230ish.. So I thought I would give it a try because I needed a decent watch that had silent alarms and can give me notifications. Just as an FYI I work in an office and I am not that active so I thought this watch would last two days for sure. Here are my experiences:On 100% life without changing the settings (out of the box) it was really bad. Lasted a little longer than half of a dayon 100% life changing all the settings to OFF or minimal (some you couldn't turn completely off)and using the battery optimization tool in the beginning of the day  lasted about a day in a half maybe if i was lucky. I literally was using it as a watch that was it no calls or anything...I am currently having it returned because I cannot do anything on it without the fear of the battery running out less than what was stated and thus not a fun/worth having for a $230 watch...  It just isnt worth it. A friend recommended me to go for just the basic older version Samsung smart watch. It is bigger and bulkier but if it allows me to use it without having to worry every half day that it will just loose all the battery then I am willing to make that compromise.

  I bought the 44in version and the watch is perfect size, not too bulky and comfortable to sleep with. Sleep tracking is decent but there is room for improvements. I use it with always on HR, AOD, location and notifications activated and I usually charge it for about an hour every morning when the battery is around 65-70% but it can last two days if I forget to charge it.Overall, the watch is not perfect but it's definitely very, very good and I'm very happy with my purchase.

  Honestly, I love this watch. The demands of my job have changed and I was tired of beating up my Rolex at work. So I bought a smart watch to wear that I wouldn't mind taking some of the daily abuse that I put a watch through. I love this watch so far! I did not know how much I could love a watch again. There are a lot of reviews on poor battery life. The only way I could see the battery life being an issue is if you are CONSTANTLY fiddling with the thing. When worn for watch purposes and checking various things throughout the day, I would estimate that the battery would easily last for 2 days. If you are looking for a watch with a purpose, this is it!

    Great for Everything but Fitness Tracking

  Really nice watch for notifications from your favorite social apps when you're not right next to your phone or your phone is on silent. However, as far as fitness-tracking is concerned, this is not it. The calories and steps I've taken that it tells me are way off compared to the new Fitbit on my other wrist, which seemed away more accurate and help me adjust my macros. The sleep tracking is okay, but I also prefer fitbit's version over this. A couple things I do like about this watch though are how I can use it as a remote to take a picture on my phone, control Spotify while I'm working out, and have simplified GPS instructions always on my wrist whenever I ask for directions on Google maps. This watch is pretty much good for everything except for a fitness tracking. Hopefully Samsung will release new software that incorporates the heart rate sensor into calculating calories and steps and catch up with Fitbit in the fitness realm.

  I am coming from using Fitbits for a while.  I am not hard-core athlete or anything and do not need to GPS track workouts, but the watch tracking my activity is just as good as the Fitbit.  I actually think the heart rate tracking is better possibly.  Fitbit seemed too low on average.  I have the 40mm version which seems bigger than I thought and thicker, so soo glad I didn't get the bigger version.Smartwatch features are great.  Like to answer and talk on the watch and text.I was used to the decent battery life of fitbits, usually around 5 days.  This is 2 days for me.  I charge it every two days.  There are settings that would make it longer, like one that turns off the constant heart rate monitor.  Then it lasts a lot longer.  And there is a setting just to use it as a watch and nothing else, that gives you like 30 days.Removed one star because of battery life.

",1.0,Elizabeth R.,"Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  It's fine if all you want is a smart watch that does sleep tracking.  But if you expect accurate heart rate readings, forget it.  As soon as I start exercising, my heart rate rapidly climbs to way higher than normal.  I can put on 1 of my 2 other heart rate monitor and get much more normal readings.  I have been using Polar products for decades and they are superb at heart rates.  But since I have a Samsung phone, I thought I would try this. I will not make this mistake again.  Stupid me, I waited 3 days too late to return it.  I am terrible disappointed at this watch and at Samsung.

  I read reviews. I disect them. Then I make a decision. Althought there are pros and cons to everything, this was worth the risk. The only ""issue"" I've had is that the watch will sometimes unlair when streaming netflix or another movie app on my phone. The way I fixed it was to delete the watch from the app and repair it. Haven't had any issues since. Everything works. I absolutely love it and when this one does eventually, because it will, I'll but another at that time. The pink band doesn't get dirty or look dirty. The watch itself is sturdy. I've hit it a few times on accident. No dings or scratches.  If you're hesitant, just take the leap and try it. I'd you don't like it then you'll know when you find the right one.

  Beautiful smartwatch, nice bright colors has everything you'd want in a smartwatch. Unfortunately the fitness side of this watch not what I expected. Floors climbed count is terrible, I climb 20 floors per day usually this watch records 1 at the most same problem I have with a 2 year old Galaxy watch (Fitbit Charge 4 records all floors climbed). I thought by now they would have corrected this issue. Many comments on user forums and Google about this issue with no clear fix. Heart monitor can be wildly off. Lucky to get 2 days on battery. Sending this watch back, no sense having 2 similar watches (have original Galaxy watch) with the same problems.

  First off, the activity tracker does not use heart rate to track calories burned so your numbers will be way off. Second, the watch was eight months old when the back fell off and samsung pay started giving it seizures. Sent it in for repair and the said the watch was out of warranty because it had water damage. Yeah, the back fell off. How do you think water/sweat got in? I did not swim with or shower with it. The estimated repair cost was as much as buying a new one. For a watch that you are SUPPOSED to be able to swim with how can you void a warranty from water damage? What the actual F*#@. I spent three hours in a excruciating seventh level of hell with their phone support trying to receive assistance only to be disconnected. Upon reconnection, no one had logged any of my previous interactions and could not help me as the service order was cancelled. I used to be a big samsung supporter, and I WILL NEVER BUY ANOTHER ONE OF THEIR PRODUCTS. Save your money and buy something else.

  Just wore my watch while on my Sole E25 elliptical. I was on level 16 for 45 munutes. My elliptical said my heart rate was 134 and I burned 753 calories. My watch said I hit 128 bpm max, average was 113 bpm and I burned 342 calories. I believe the elliptical because it accounts for body weight and the amount of friction it is set to. Not saying I don't like the watch, just don't trust the calorie burn.

    Excelente reloj con features que realmente hacen que valga la pena el gasto
  
  
",5.0,Orlando Rodriguez Torres,"Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2021","









  
    
  Generalmente he tenido smartwatches más económicos o manillas y me han cumplicado bien. Esta vez me fui por un smartwatch más costoso en búsqueda de una mejor experiencia de usuario y vaya que lo he conseguido. Mi reseña está siendo hecha usando un Mate 20 Pro y un reloj Bluetooth (depende muchísimo del smartphone para funcionar)1. Pantalla e Interfaz: Muy buena pantalla del reloj, excelentes negros. Muchísima variedad de WatchFaces para elegir, muchas de ellas personalizables y la interfaz de usuario muy rápida y con excelente respuesta. Este es uno de los puntos donde muchos relojes quedan cortos, ya que suelen laguear o quedarse pegados en ciertas labores y una de las razones por las que decidí irme por este.2. Notificaciones y respuestas: Este era el punto más importante para mí: Yo quería sí o sí ver las imágenes y stickers de WhatsApp en el reloj, porque infortunadamente, muchos de mis contactos envían todo el tiempo ambas cosas y escriben cada vez menos, por lo que ya estaba aburrido de tener que sacar el teléfono en la calle para todo. En este punto MUY contento, el sistema de notificaciones es un poco diferente al de otros relojes, pero me es MUY funcional poder ver las imágenes/stickers/emoticones con muy buena calidad y poder responder ahí mismo en el reloj. El teclado es similar al de los teléfonos de antes, por lo que para mí resulta cómodo (para la gente más joven seguro que no mucho) y las respuestas rápidas son personalizables e incluso permiten emoticones, así que ayudan mucho. El reconocimiento de voz sí me parece malito en español, poco funcional, solo útil para frases muy pequeñas y no con lenguaje coloquial. Las notificaciones guardan un historial, por lo que muchas veces uno ve la conversación y NO solo la última notificación y me gustó mucho que si me llega una notificación y levanto la mano para ver el reloj, este, además de encender la pantalla, abre automáticamente la notificación, así que ni siquiera tengo que tocar el reloj para ver lo que me escriben (estos son los detalles que marcan diferencia).3. Llamadas: He hablado un par de veces y muy buena experiencia. De mi parte extrañaría un poquito más de volumen, pero realmente tampoco es importante, ya que la idea tampoco es que todos escuchen de qué estamos hablando, con el volumen que hay se escucha muy bien. Si usas auriculares, como yo, hay siempre una opción en el reloj para intercambiar entre el audio/mic del reloj con el teléfono, para continuar la llamada desde los auriculares o desde el teléfono con mucha facilidad.3.  Mediciones: Tiene de todo, las clásicas ritmo cardiaco, podómetro, gps, sueño, VO2 max, estrés etc. Pero tiene otras medidas que yo no había tenido antes como: ECG (electrocardiograma), BP (presión) y altímetro (toca bajar la aplicación, no viene preinstalada). Es de aclarar que el ECG y el BP, para mí que NO uso teléfono Samsung, sino un Mate 20 pro, resultó un poco ""tricky"" activarlos, pero gracias a XDA pude hacerlo y con MUY buenos resultados. También es importante dar a conocer que el BP es un lab hasta donde entiendo y que toca calibrarlo con un tensiómetro real cada 4 semanas más o menos. Así que igual, toca tener el tensiómetro en la casa, la ventaja está en no depender de él en todas partes.4. Multimedia: Solo uso Spotify y recomiendo mucho más usar el Widget default de Samsung que el widget de Spotify. Además de que el default funciona para cualquier aplicación del teléfono que reproduzca algo, funciona mucho más rápido también. La app de Spotify de mi parte solo me resulta útil para buscar la lista que quiero escuchar, porque tampoco me deja elegir canciones (esto me hubiese gustado ver las canciones, pero bueno, tal vez eso ya es mucho pedir).5. Batería: Al igual que los relojes de Apple, son los teléfonos con la ""peor"" batería. Sinembargo, coloco peor entre comillas, porque para el poder que tienen, antes me tiene super satisfecho el tema de la batería. En mi caso, lo necesito para el día y para 1 solo día voy mucho más que sobrado.6. Detalles buenos y cosas no muy buenas: (+) No es multimedia pero me sorprendió tener un cleinte para Openhab en la tienda de Galaxy, ya que con eso es que controlo la domótica de mi casa (además de los asistentes por supuesto). (-) No todas las aplicaciones están disponibles para mi país, muchas veces la aplicación se ve desde el navegador del pc pero NO es instalable. (-) el procedimiento para activar el ECG y el BP no fue dificil para mí, pero para muchos usuarios va a ser problemático. (-) Tener que recalibrar cada 4 semanas el BP no chévere, pero bueno, es lo que hay. (-) En mi caso tuve que instalar todo un arsenal de aplicaicoens para que corra bien, y digo, corre SUPER bien, no se me desconecta nunca, se me reconecta fácil, no he perido una sola notificación, pero vamos! Tuve que instalar Galaxy Wearable, Samsung Services, Active 2 Plugin, Samsung Health, Samsung Health Monitor (ECG y BP) y si le sumo Navigator Pro para GPS, siempre son bastantes, aunque en general me parece que funciona bastante bien porque no comen tanta RAM como creí, es bastante decente en consumo de recursos así que el celular no ha sufrido en nada prácticamente.

  Been wearing this daily for 4 months now... As a smartwatch skeptic (and collector of traditional watches) I pulled the trigger on it as a whim. The more I wear it, the more useful it is. The ability to access messages, emails, and notifications in public without whipping our my phone has been a ton more useful than I could have realized.It's a beautiful little piece of tech, intuitive to use, and pretty good looking to boot. I didn't purchase it for the fitness functions, but as the months have passed, they have turned into data points I reference daily.Frankly, a smartwatch is still a luxury that really only excels in specific use cases, but I've found myself using it constantly.

    Step counts not accurate

  I bought the galaxy gear fit several years ago and decided it was time for an upgrade. I like the fact that the charger doesn't require you to take off the band like with the gear fit, and the battery life has been great so far. The sleep tracking is extremely detailed as well which I enjoy.The only thing that I'm not a fan of with this watch so far, is that the step counter is not accurate in the slightest. My job has me on my feet for 10+ hours at a time, and I'm usually running around like crazy, but the steps don't go up. (After four hours on my feet at work last night the step count only went up by about 500, and as a waitress I know that wasn't anywhere close to what I had actually walked so far).After a little research it said that your arm has to be swinging while walking in order for the steps to be counted, which sucks when your arms are full and you're carrying things alot of the time (in my case plates & drinks at work). So in order to get a more accurate step count I have to keep my phone on me as well, which I don't care for. I got this watch mainly because I wanted to keep better track of my steps & activity so the fact that it doesn't track my steps accurately is a huge bummer.

  The only good thing about this watch is the screen. If you don't own a Samsung phone, the watch's advertised features and functionality will be crippled. Samsung launched the Active 2 with spo2/pulseox sensors enabled, then removed them from the app. Samsung requires multiple app downloads to use the device, and the apps are a buggy mess. The rotary touchscreen concept is brilliant in theory, but Samsung's user interface makes the watch difficult at best. While Android users will have slightly better luck using the watch for messaging, iPhone users should avoid this sloppy product altogether. Additionally, as noted in numerous other reviews, Samsung's warranty support is negligible and the company rarely honors claims it stands behind its products. Apple and Garmin, while higher cost up front, offer far superior products that will stand the test of time.

It's such a shame because this watch is awesome for everything else.  I have had Samsung phones for years.  I was so excited to try this watch.  One would think that if ACTIVE was in the name, it would work as a fitness device.  Unreal.Here is a snip from my chat with the first Samsung rep:Me: I just got my new Active 2. I love it so far; however, the calorie count for workouts is very wrong. When I researched a little bit, I found that this is apparently an issue your company has had with several of its watches. Is there a fix for this?10:12 AMSorry for the experience. Unfortunately for now the bug isn't still fix.After expressing disbelief, she passed me to the next rep:Me: So, you're telling me you released a fitness product that cannot correctly calculate Calories?10:35 AMI'm sorry for the inconvenience caused.10:37 AMBut I want to inform you that we have no such reported issues yet. (Which is opposite of what the first rep said and is proven to be false for their watches as you just have to google calorie count issues and samsung to see all of the complaints.)This was horrible.  I might actually have to switch to apple products which makes me want to puke.DO NOT BUY THIS DEVICE UNLESS YOU DON'T CARE IF THE FITNESS INFORMATION IS CORRECT.Funny note:  When I got a copy of the transcript emailed to me, they deleted the part where their employee said they were aware and it was a bug.

Finally the watch has actually had stopped working. It is still under warranty, yet Samsung is refusing to repair it unless I pay almost as much as the watch currently costs, claiming the water resistant watch has water damage. I have NEVER taken the watch into a water environment- not showering, nothing, so this is rather upsetting. I owned the watch barely 9 months.

  A little over a year ago my daughter love her to death but in a Samsung J3 prime for one of our friends who didn’t actually need a new phone. About a week ago I was informed that my old Samsung phone and I mean really old would no longer be supported by my cell phone service. During that time everyone has laughed at me for having such an old phone, but I loved the phone and rarely used it. During that time my husband got an iPhone and my daughter gave him a watch that works with it. So thinking that I should probably head into the current century by two but the active to watch that pairs with the Samsung phone. I was a bit hesitant initially because I was unable to find any information telling me whether or not the fun that I had would pair with the watch. I did a little bit of reading and went ahead and ordered the watch anyway, suspecting that if it didn’t pair with the phone I could at least use it without the phone.I am not in anyway a techno geek, but I was able to charge the watch, and the Samsung wearable app was already on it, so I followed the steps to pair it with the watch and presto change oh within an hour after starting I was done pairing it and putting information into it that is synchronized with the Samsung fitness app which I also was able to download without any kind of hassle. So for all those people wondering if it paired with the J3, yes it Samsung wearable app was already on it, so I followed the steps to pair it with the watch and presto change oh within an hour after starting I was done pairing it and putting information into it that is synchronized with the Samsung fitness app which I also was able to download without any kind of hassle. So for all of those people wondering if it paired with the J3, yes it does. I did however add extra storage space to the phone and toggle it to move most of the information into the SD card. I don’t know if I explained up properly but initially the phone that I had when it started the pairing process said that my phone didn’t have enough storage. But I discovered that I hadn’t turned the phone on so it couldn’t really pair with it until I turned it on but then after I did magic occurred.I did some adjustments on the settings, and slept with it all night and in fact it did track my sleep. The watchband is very comfortable, but I did notice that the one that I bought had a pretty large band on it so I have it on the second tightest hole. The nice thing about the Band is that it tucks under The other side of the watch band after you have secured it on your arm. So there’s no need really to adjust the band, at least for me. It did track my sleep it does seem to track my activity levels, and the steps that I take and I also track my food intake anyway and so the app actually takes care of that so I don’t have to write it down in a journal.I gave it a fiveThe other side of the watch band after you have secured it on your arm.

It did track my sleep it does seem to track my activity levels, and the steps that I take and I also track my food intake anyway and so the app actually takes care of that so I don’t have to write it down in a journal.I gave it a five for durability. Not so much based on the fact that I have had to watch for a little less than 24 hours but because based upon the design the size the watchband it appears to be made so that it is durable, at least enough to fool a first time buyer. I have yet to discover how to use the voice to text on it, but I am receiving emails weather reports and other things that will probably take up too much of my personal time, but overall it seems to be working quite well and I am impressed because a non-techno geek like me was actually able to pair the watch with the phone and carry-on without the stress or grief or regrets that I purchased the watch.So my daughter was pretty impressed that I was able to do all of that all on my very own. So I guess I’m living in the new Century now linked to my cell phone as though it was an appendage of my body and wearing a synchronized apparatus that is being worn on an appendage of my body.UPDATE. So sad to report the watch is in the watch hospital for the second time. I was able to over time use most functions. But I live in a two story home and it wouldn’t count floors. I tried everything on line, then the non techno geek in me finally called the Company, we tried everything, which included a lot of running up and down stairs so in it went for a replacement for the altimeter. It didn’t work after they returned it. I could tel the didn’t functionally test it because there were no stairs counted. I called again, same thing. Tried all the settings, up and down the stairs swinging arms. Now the bad part is that I Live in Hawaii and they don’t cover mailing. It’s a bit expensive. All told, the customer service is good. Polite, knowledgeable etc. I asked them to be sure to test it functionally before they send it back. We’ll see. I have a sleep disorder and it seems to track my sleep, heartbeat and activity level. But one of the main reasons I bought it was to track how many times I trek up and down the stairs. It’s been gone over 2 weeks now, so I hope they got it and fix it or give me a new watch.

    Fierce contender in the smartwatch market, especially if you have a Samsung.
  
",4.0,Dan,"Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  So originally I was going to get a Wear OS Ticwatch S2 by Google and Mobvio because Wear OS looked appealing and whatnot and it seemed convenient. Originally I bought a pretty lackluster Fitbit Versa 2, the tiny screen, lack of apps and mediocre health capabilities and their OS was just not doing it for me at all. I returned it and got my money back and spent just a little bit more to get this one. I should note that even while the Fossil Gen 5 was on special for Prime Day I STILL ended up getting this one. The 44mm, the Samsung OS, apps (albeit a bit lacking in amount), battery life and overall performance and look... I'm extremely happy with this one. The truth is that while some watches over 350+ have everything in it (built-in gps, nfc, etc) this one has it for just a bit less than your other watches that either have 1 or the other or none at all. I was genuinely surprised at how it performed and just how many features it had on top of everything. Built in speaker? Yes please. Waterproof? Um duh yeah. 44mm screen, interchangeable bands and accurate health data collection on top of gps and nfc, it's a no brainier.Honestly some smartwatches are just glorified watches with a few gimics and no real value. If you buy a fitbit you're not necessarily buying the product for the device itself rather the Fitbit OS and app that comes with it. Meanwhile you buy this watch and it's almost like you're buying a mini-phone because of all the features and necessities of a smartwatch and a health tracker. As much as I didn't try the Fossil Gen5 and gave it a chance I really don't regret it as i'm quite happy with my choice especially with my Samsung Galaxy phone that pairs even better than expected and I wouldn't get that with a Fossil or Diesel or Ticwatch I was looking at. If you're worried about battery life like I was wary before buying you won't really have a problem with the Active 2 as it charges EXTREMELY fast with my anker charger and if you tweak your settings right the battery should last you 2-3 days no charge. Just lower the brightness as much as you can and keep it so it's active only when you touch it and the battery should last as advertised.The watch itself is a bit heavier than the Fitbit I tried however the band is really comfortable for prolonged use and I have no problem sleeping with it. Also if watchfaces are your thing don't buy them from the Galaxy store and whatnot use the Facer app and you can get some pretty cool premium looking watch faces for free or less than 5.99 that are interactive and adaptive which is pretty cool thing I discovered. What else can I say, if I had a couple cons to this watch it'd be that you'd probably be happier if you have a Galaxy device beforehand maybe I'm not sure how well it might perform without a Galaxy phone or that not all of my cards worked with Samsung Pay. Maybe also that app selection is a bit bland, however still better than fitbit not sure about Google WearOS. Overall I'm pretty happy with it. If you're looking for a pretty nice all around watch this is probably the one for you. There are still many features I've yet to figure out and it feels a lot like my phone on my wrist. I can think of a lot of cool things to add like a Blue-light filter but I figured that if I mess with the visibility accessibility setting I can reduce the amount of blue light given by changing the screen color opacity to orange because you can do that and deactivate it during the day but I would like something like that.Anyways if you got this far, this watch is excellent and definitely in the top 10 2020 smartwatch lists. Right up there with the Fossil Gen5 or the Garmin Active and others.

    Nice watch ruined by poor support from Samsung
  
",2.0,Vlad P,"Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've enjoyed using this watch for the last few months! It's a clean and simple interface - helps me check my notifications without pulling out my phone, allows me to check the time and weather at a glance, tracks my steps, and quickly set timers for various tasks around the house.Unfortunately, all of this is marred by very poor support from Samsung. As a current example of the problems I've had from that side, the Samsung Wear app on my phone indicates that there is an update for the watch and it needs to update it. However, every time it tries, it fails to transfer the update to the watch. It continues to retry doing it, and while it is doing that, it fails to update other apps, fails to reliably push notifications, and continues to drain the battery of both the phone and the watch.It has been this way for a couple of weeks, and there isn't even any recognition that this is a problem. The Samsung community boards are filled with complains and no responses. I would NOT recommend this ecosystem to anyone at this point.

  Update:  after the back fell off for the umpteenth time with no hope of staying in place, I called Samsung for repair/replacement.  After finally getting an unpleasant service rep, I was informed that to get service for the watch they would need a credit card number.  I asked why I would have to pay for a defect in manufacturing and was informed that I’m SOL unless I wanted to give a card number.  I informed the unpleasant person that I will not do that and I will also never purchase another Samsung product.Probably ignorance on my part but my text messages don't show up on the watch.  I am able to accept or decline calls on it.  The fitness features are pretty good but could be accessed with a much less expensive watch.  Changing the watch faces is fun and you can download holiday themes or even a photo.  As far as durability, the watch face has two deep scratches and I've only had it for three months.  I was wiping off the sensor part of the watch and the sensor piece slid off!!!!  I replaced the gasket and the sensor but I'm now worried about wearing it if I'm going to get sweaty and isn't that the whole point???

Thats the only reason i bought the Active watch 2 and so far many month have passed since it release no update and even more so not even a wisper of one releasing any time in the future. If they would notify us of anything in the works... im sure that would satisfy most us average samsung consumers, and there are a lot of us out there who opt in for samsung devises exclusivle.

  Nice watch, haven't messed around with it much but it's comfortable, perfect size (40mm) for my wrist. For the people with tattoos on the wrist, the heartrate monitor will not read through the ink for some reason. I've tested it on multiple areas, new and old ink and right outside the ink it will read. That's one big drawback for me because I bought the watch mostly for that. Other than that so far it's great, more features than I'll utilize for sure.

I tried repeatedly to get more information about how that could have happened in the 4 months I had the watch only to wait on hold for 20 min to speak to a technician and finally gave up.

  I am a big Garmin fan but I had to replace mine due to it going faulty. So I decided on the Samsung Active 2 44mm, I wasnt impressed with it when I had it for a few days. Battery life just over a day and I am sure the Hr sensor on it isnt accurate. The screen is nice and big and the glass with the display is very clear and crisp . I love how you can answer phone calls and write text like using your finger to draw the letters. And get the notifications without missing them , I use the lighted full screen when working out  and put it on gray scale when not using it for tracking my workout. So the battery can last up to 4 maybe 5 plus days. Even so you can still read your hear rate and get notifications, alarm etc with the battery saver on. I like how you can change the straps which is real easy. I personally dont think the HR sensor is accurate or the treadmill ap as its way off. The only one thing I dislike about the samsung watch is the ap, its not too good you cant see your full gps walk, or heart rate or other health readings  . If they updated , made more or a better ap then this watch would be the best on the market . A great watch with a bad ap is its downfall .Oh but if you planning on buying one buy a screen protector just in case.

  I bought this watch primarily to use while running. I'm not certain how well it works as a heart rate tracker, but its reported distance is typically at least a mile off even when using the high accuracy feature during my 4 to 7 mile runs. When looking at the map it generates it seems to cut through curves in the road instead of following them. It also has a spotty connection on occasion when used as a music player which can be irritating. It does seem to track steps accurately though and functions well overall as a smartwatch.

    Great all-around watch, but not for the primarily fitness-motivated
  
",4.0,Victoria Caudill,"Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2020","I used this watch regularly for about 2 months, and found it to be a great all-around watch for the price and the features that you get. The strengths of the Active Watch 2 lie in its style and its ability to perform as a smartwatch, with decent activity tracking features to round it out. There are definitely some improvements to be made, and if you're looking for a dedicated fitness watch with all the bells and whistles, you should probably look elsewhere. With that being said, this watch does a wonderful job of giving you everything that you need, and perhaps even some things that you didn't think you needed, in a stylish package.

I will end up having to return this watch because despite all of my many efforts, I kept getting a pervasive rash where the metal met my skin. I made sure to clean the watch and my wrist daily and kept the watch as dry as possible; I also tried nearly every tightness of the band, but no matter how tight or loose I kept it, the rash continued. Looking online, this appears to be a problem that isn't singular, which is unfortunate. Were this not an issue, I would make this watch my primary smartwatch.

My short breakdown of this watch is as follows:

Pros:
The best looking watch I've found to date
Plethora of smartwatch features that are customizable
Built-in GPS and music storage is key
Decent fitness tracking

Cons:
Sleep tracking needs a LOT of work
Manually fixing workout readings can become annoying
Can cause a serious rash for those with sensitive skin or metal allergies
ECG reader still not released (and lack of some health tracking features found on other watches)

Here are my thoughts on the main aspects of this watch after 2 months of nearly daily use:

Build and Smartwatch Features:

This is where the Active Watch 2 really shines. It has a huge amount of features that you can tailor to your needs, and the design of both the watch and the software it uses is beautiful. You can wear this watch with just about anything and it will always look good. The bands are very easy to change out, and Amazon sells quite a few watch face covers if you want to change the color of the watch itself to better match the bands (they often also double as a scratch-resistant cover, which is great). Samsung really did a great job with just how pretty and vibrant the screen is on the Active 2, and there are so many watch faces that you'll never get bored looking at it or tailoring it to your outfit. The bezel around the screen isn't intrusive at all like on some other watches, and the watch itself feels very nice and sturdy. I love the scroll bezel as it makes everything much easier and much quicker to find when you have as many different pages as I do. It has a number of different notifications that it registers, and it's very easy to respond from your watch if you don't want to bother taking your phone out; you can set a number of unique quick responses too, or ask Bixby to respond for you (works best with texts). Also, even though the app store isn't the most expansive, it does have a few very cool 3rd party apps. Taking calls from the watch isn't the most graceful experience, but it works in a pinch if you can't reach your phone. The built-in music storage is something I have never had before in a watch, and I didn't know I needed it until now. Being able to download Spotify playlists and not have to worry about having to lug my phone with me on runs or even just doing chores around the house was so nice, and the built-in GPS meant it would still record the length of my runs.

Health and Fitness Tracking:

I was fairly pleased overall with the fitness tracking features of this watch. The heart-rate monitor appears to be very accurate, with the step counter and altimeter being more or less accurate as well (with the altimeter being the far less accurate of those two). The burned calorie tracking seemed to be a little on the high-end, but it was more or less on par with the readouts I was getting from my Garmin. While I didn't put too much stock into the stress feature (wasn't entirely sure how accurate it is), the breathing exercises were neat and I enjoyed doing them as a way to start my day and wind down for the night. One of the biggest hit-or-miss things I've found working out with this watch is that it can take a lot of manual input to make sure the readings are accurate. For any cardio-based workout, even something as simple as walking, it's much easier to manually input the start and finish of your activity if you want an accurate reading rather than relying on the auto-detection, which can be off by a few minutes. Additionally, if you do any workout that relies on counting reps, you're most likely going to need to make manual adjustments afterwards to input the correct number of reps you did. For some of the workouts, you have to have your wrist in a certain position for it to be read correctly, but it's honestly easier to manually adjust it than it is to do an extra 10 reps trying to get it to register your movements. One good thing about the Active 2 is that you can pre-program workouts so that you don't have to go in and try and scroll through all 39 of the other workouts for each new set of movements you're doing. Another is that the animations for the different workouts (especially yoga!) are smooth and easy to comprehend, which I appreciated greatly.

Sleep Tracking:

This was definitely the worst feature of the watch. I found it to be wildly inaccurate, especially because I suffer from insomnia and wake up several times throughout the night. My biggest gripes with this personally are that it registered me as falling asleep faster than in actuality, didn't register me as awake in the mornings if I woke up and remained in bed, and registered me as still being asleep when I would wake up throughout the night. I even kept a pen and pad next to the bed to quickly jot down the time when I would wake up, and it would take anywhere from 15 minutes up to an hour for me to fall back asleep - the watch counted all of that time as me having never woken up. I compared these readings to my older Garmin watch and found that the Garmin was far more accurate than the Active 2 (not as accurate as my FitBit, however). If you have a regular sleep schedule or don't care too much about the sleep tracking, you'll probably have a better experience with this feature than I did, but don't expect the sleep tracking on this watch to be the end-all, be-all.

Battery Life:

All reports of this watch getting roughly 2 days of batter life are pretty spot on. I would extend it beyond that by taking it off and cleaning/charging it when I would shower or if I was going to be doing something that I could potentially crack my watch during (like roller blading), which would usually net me another day or so before having to take it off and let it charge for ~2 hours. If you're someone who likes to use the always on display mode, you will definitely have to charge it more frequently. But even with as much tinkering and logging of manual workouts, or using the yoga workout which involves watching a lot of animations, my batter life always lasted at least a day and a half.",Size: 44mmStyle: BluetoothColor: Silver

  I had such high hopes for this watch, I read the reviews and thought well, im not going to be using it for everything it offers.. only sleep tracking, workouts and maybe a phone call here and there so I should be fine. No. I barely use this and the battery lasts a day at best. I didnt work out today, and didn't use it for texting/calling... it was at 100% when I went to sleep last night and now it's at 21%. Also, it takes a long while to charge, almost 2 hours. Ive always had Samsung products and have never been disappointed, but this battery is terrible. On a more positive note, the interface is flawless, the movements and going from screen to screen is very easy.

  As someone who was a past fitbit versa user as well as an apple user, this has to be my favorite. It runs much faster than apple and it tracks just as much. It is a little harder to use than the versa, but if you are someone who is willing to learn and can adjust to new tech, it is worth it. My only complaint is that I liked the Fitbit better than the samsung health it was much easier to understand and it sent me weekly fitness reviews once a week, and that the battery only lasts a day and a half, with doing a 30 min workout each of those days.

  This watch is not accurate on most of what it is advertised for. It only counts half of my steps at best. It says it counts how many floors of stairs were climbed... I climb up and down stairs all day long and the most it reads is 1 floor each day..When I am sitting at my shuffling papers, it tries saying I was sleeping during that time. I am moving my arms but it says I am sleeping.I am so very dissatisfied in this.Also the battery life. It says up to 5 days, but I have to charge every day and a half. That's after I put it on power saving mode.The only things I like about this watch is the look, the heartrate monitor, and that I can read and respond to messages without having to pull out my phone out of my purse when I am on the go.If you want a watch to track your steps and sleep, $25 dollar watches work just as well if not a bit better.I am really bumbed. I was really looking forward to the features of this watch just to find it's not accurate at all.

  Amazing watch, tooooons of amazing features but it does have some issues with apps. I've had sleep tracking run an hour or so longer after I've woke up. No idea why since I'm moving around. Only other issues I have are with downloaded apps but those have nothing to do with Samsung products. I wish the battery last longer. I'll get a few days depending on how much I use it. Heavy use will kill the battery in a day or two while light use will last much longer. But it's not something is consider a ""terrible battery"". It lasts x2 -x4 longer than my phone so I guess that's great. It will take a while to dial in the watch to how you want it but that's part of the fun. Is highly recommend this watch to anyone

    NOT WATER RESISTANT AT ALL

  I had this watch for maybe 7 months before it stopped working. It was running slow and the battery life was awful after only 2 months. Samsung claims the watch is water resistant but it most definitely is not. If you are planning on buying this watch, DO NOT take it anywhere near water and do not work out with it on (even though that is basically what it is for) because your sweat may cause water damage. The watch was still under warranty so I called Samsung, created a ticket and sent it in (which also cost me $7.00 for packaging by the way). They came back with a quote of $220 to fix a watch I could buy brand new for $200! They claimed it was ""out of warranty"" due to water damage....from what...my sweat from working out? Water damage from rinsing off dishes and was not even submerged to the supposed allowance of 50 meters? I also always wiped my watch off and never left it wet. Cared for it just like they said🤷‍♀️. This was an expensive and hard lesson to learn. You are better off buying a cheap $30 smart watch. Hope this review helps. Best of Luck.

The apps are all trash and since the sync wifi feature doesn't work I can only utilize bluetooth unless I manually enter the incredibly large number of wifi networks I use on a regular basis.It's ok I guess, better than a Fitbit but nothing compared to an apple watch.

In order to make calls  or send sms with the watch without a service plan you just have to have your phone within blue tooth range and connected . If you left your phone at home the only way the watch will be able to make calls is if the watch itself has a service plan. I cant comment on the physical monitoring features the heartbeat sensor seems to work well I just dont use the others enough to make an accurate comment .  And the different watch faces and downloads are to cool. Battery life seems to be about 2 full days . I dont know were there is a battery saving option that may increase battery life.  All in all my girl and I really enjoy them . And dont forget for them to be waterproof you have to turn on the water lock feature before you go jumping into the pool.  Go to settings.

  Love my watch and it does seem a little behind on calories burned but you just have to turn on the work out tracker when you're working out and also set up your correct body measurements. Then it's usually spot on. I've had the Apple watch too and it's the same issue. The stairs that you've climbed never seem to be accurate but do I really care about that? No. The steps are spot on as well. I visually watch it count my steps on the Samsung health app. What is awesome is now the new bezel feature... Which allows you to quickly access other apps and change the volume with music. The music is awesome too because I connected it to my Spotify account and it will play your Spotify music on the watch when you're away from you phone. The only downside is bixby... Samsung has really gotta work out the kinks on that one... Terrible voice recognition. However, overall I love it! Lots of improvements compared to the last one 😄 P.S. I've boycotted all apple products and couldn't be happier.

My favorite is to track my biking activity! It motivates me to workout everyday, so that's another plus!Battery life is two days - EASILY!Another great thing about this is the controllability and non-dependance on your phone. You can record workouts, control music in your buds, and also watch videos on this - all while staying away from your phone!!! It has to be in acceptable range though, since this is not a standalone LTE watch.I think it's the best value for money smartwatch money can buy right now!

  I got this to monitor my heart rate throughout the day after the doctor said I have chronic tachycardia. It's also super useful for a bunch of other things and was easy to pair with my phone. My one big complaint is that the product guide and instructions are awful. They don't walk you through anything, which can be distressing and confusing if this is your first ever smart watch. However, the product itself is really great once you figure it out, so I'm not taking away any stars.I got the cloud gray watch, which I expected to be more of a pale blue based on Amazon photos, but it really is just like a cool gray in person. I have a very small wrist and it fits me well at the 2nd tightest loop.The watch works very well for me and pairs effortlessly with my Galaxy Note 10. I currently use the pixel heart wallpaper so I can monitor the time and my heart rate constantly. My only wish is that wallpapers were more customizable, because I really want a simple wallpaper that displays the date, time, and my heart rate so I don't have to flip between widgets. I'm not a big fan of how the watch likes to remind me to move every hour... When I have online class, I don't have the option to move often, and I don't know how to turn those startling notifications off.Lastly, I don't know if I would recommend Amazon's delivery service for an expensive product like this watch. The driver didn't follow my delivery instructions!! My packages often get stolen if left out in the mail room (which does not lock and has a glass door and no security cameras, so anyone from the street can take packages), so I always request drivers to put the box in the mailbox or in front of my apartment door (which is only around 10 steps away max). They left out out of the mailbox for anyone to be able to see and take, and didn't even take a photo to confirm it had been delivered. This product cost me nearly $300 and they did that, but when I order any other cheap package, they follow my instructions to a T and always take a photo to confirm delivery!! It's ridiculous. It's probably better to pick this up in person at a store if you are worried about package security. I'm just glad I was home to pick it up immediately after it was delivered.

  I purchased this watch in April of 2020. The sleep function on this watch doesn't calculate accurately. I have a dog that wakes me up in the middle of the night, so when I get up to take her out, the sleep feature thinks I'm staying up. The battery life isn't great I have to charge it every other day. On July 15,2020 my watch starts saying it's rebooting. I tried powering it off, resetting it, putting it on the charger nothing worked. I had a black screen unless it was on the charger and then it would only say it was rebooting. On July 16,2020 I called the Samsung customer service number and the representative I spoke with tried some trouble shooting , but nothing worked. I was told to take it to Best Buy and let their Geek Squad take a look at it. I take it to Best Buy to be told you have to make an appointment and they're booked for 3 weeks. I then chat with an Amazon representative who told me that it is out of warranty and they can't replace it. The Amazon representative contacted Samsung again, only to be told I have send it in to see if they can repair it. Hopefully they can otherwise I'm out of pocket over $200.00, because they won't replace it. This is not acceptable, especially when you pay over $200.00 for a product. I had a Fit bit watch that lasted over 3 years, then I had a Garmin that lasted at least 2 years before the battery went out.  So to say the least I'm not happy with this product at all.

  I've owned this watch for 7 months now, and so I hope my feedback would provide an accurate and detailed description of my concerns and fascinations with this watch. Before jumping in, I have the black 44mm Active 2 (wifi) watch paired with a Samsung Galaxy s10e.To get straight to the point, this watch does its job well...and that's it.It doesn't strive to jump through excessive hoops to overwhelm you with extensive features that will mark it different from the rest of the competition. It is a good watch with clear and abundant watch faces, it lasts for a while, it'll get you notifications, and minor app support. I'm not an expert reviewer, but I'll try to touch on these points since they are - as I feel - the highlight of the watch.PROS1. It's a good watch. Since the battery management on this watch is fairly good, you can set it up to have a ""Screen-always on"" feature enabled. What this does is that when you are not ""flicking your wrist"" to get the screen on, the screen remains a dim (but fairly visible) colorless version of your watch face. In this mode, some designs would even disappear from the watch face to only show the time, and when you adjust your wrist to turn on the screen (gesture), the whole watch face will come back. I think this is nice since I wouldn't have to keep enacting the gesture just to see my watch; at that point, I feel it defeated the efficacy of its main purpose as a watch.2. The Galaxy watch store (which I believe is just Samsung's galaxy store) has a ton of options for watch faces. Some are tacky, but if you look through, you can find some of which may fit your style. Some watch faces could also be customized to place tidbit of information on the face, information such as step count, weather, heart rate, etc.3. Battery Life. The battery is some of the best in the market I would say. It may not last as long as a Fitbit versa, but considering what it does, it does it well. With an Always-on Screen, the battery lasts easily 2 days. Without it, maybe 2-3 days. There is a power-saving mode that may limits features and can give it an extra day, but the ultra power saving mode apparently lets you use it as a clock only for 41 days. I haven't tested that, but I think it's a feature worth noting.5. Notifications. Nothing out of the ordinary here. You get notifications, and you can reply to some of them (I am not sure how well this works on iOS). There are quick reply options and then there is that Bixby voice thing. Eh. It;s ok. Not always accurate, but if you need it, it can get the job done. You can also limit what app notifications show up on your watch!CONS1. Minor app support. I don't think this is Samsung's fault entirely. I just don't see a lot of apps on their store that seems...well...good. They are tacky, pointless, or terribly designed. I am not saying that the app is what makes the watch great, but if you are buying a premium watch with money, I sort of expect at least an app store that could provide some users more functionality if they so desire.2. Oximeter? There was a rumor of the watch having this capability. It hasn't been unlocked in my entirety of owning this. I guess Samsung doesn't want to release it?3. Heart Rate sensor. Fitness on this app is otherwise great! I am just a tad bit skeptical of the accuracy of the heart rate sensor. I would use it more as a guide rather than an actual metric. When you check your heart manually, I tend to get it slightly different. Hopefully, an update would fix this.

The sleep tracking is pretty good, but I've caught it recording sleep when I was definitely awake and the other way around.The biggest issue I have though is the battery life. When I first got it, I had to charge it about every 4th or 5th day and that was reasonable. Within a year of getting it I find I have to charge it every other day. I can sometimes squeeze a 3rd day out of it when I'm less active.

  I mistakenly purchased the 40mm version before returning it for this one. I had the older Gear Frontier S3, and the extra metal on it made it seem clunkier than this really sleek, very understated model. Even if you have a smaller wrist, you might well be satisfied with this size.As for the watch's functionality, the screen is absolutely gorgeous and the apps work with a speed far beyond my earlier 2017 S3.This model is an absolute winner.

    Best attempt at a fluid smartwatch yet.
  
",5.0,Ethan Jacquin,"Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this smartwatch to replace an older, Fossil WearOS based smartwatch that did not feature heart rate tracking. I don't miss Google's WearOS ecosystem at all. I use a Samsung phone, which makes coordination between the watch and phone nearly seamless.MAIN POINTS:- Battery life is fantastic! With my old watch, I would be around 20 percent with moderate use at the end of the day. This watch, with heart rate, GPS, bluetooth on, moderate usage, puts me at around 80 percent. I charge it every night, but fully believe it would last 4-5 days with moderate usage.- Workout tracking is very easy. There are a few quick workouts to tap and go on a page, but for full tracking you have to go through the Samsung Health app.- Accurate GPS tracking- Touch-based bezel scrolling is innovative, but I prefer swiping through screens (just how I operated with my old watch)- Fast and fluid, have not experienced any slowdowns- Build quality is top notch. This is more or less a flagship device, and feels that way. The watch feels premium, sleek, and doesn't weigh much at all.- Samsung needs to update their Wear app to make settings easier. There are multiple ways to get to settings, and you may get lost looking for what you want. For example, there are settings in the watch menu itself, in the Samsung Wear app, or maybe the app specifically for what you are wanting to change (i.e. heart rate in Samsung Health.) Streamlining will go a long way.- Voice and microphone are good, sound is loud, vibration does a good job notifying you. People I've talked to through the watch could not tell a difference between my phone and watch.Overall, I'm thrilled with my purchase. This watch is next level and checks all of the boxes for things I'm looking for in a smartwatch.

  I've owned the Samsung Gearfit2 Pro for about 2 years and was very happy with it, except for the battery life and also it started to feel a bit dated recently with constant freezing and slow operation at times.I've decided to buy the Active 2 watched as my upgrade and went with the 40mm version. 1st impressions of the watch was good, I like the look and it feels very comfortable on my wrist and even when sleeping. (Hence taking the 40mm over the 44mm version)1 month in and the watch has not given me any concerns or problems. It does the step counting and fitness tracking perfectly. The battery life is definitely better than my Gearfit2 Pro, but  was hoping to get at least 2-3 days of use before needing to charge it.I currently charge it on a daily basis, but only for a short time frame while I'm showering. It's enough to last me again until the next morning.I'm very happy with the watch so far and would highly recommend it.

    Best smart/fitness watch I've owned so far!
  
",4.0,Andre F.,"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2020","I received this watch on 23, November 2019.

I wanted to use for a few weeks or so before reviewing.

I got this to replace my aging Samsung Gear Fit 2 Pro.

The Active Watch 2 is very comfortable to wear and not heavy on the wrist.

At 1.4"", the screen is very visible and easy to read. It can get really bright, so I keep it on ""3"".

It's very accurate at keeping steps and heart rate (my main reason for this watch as it is my ""daily watch"").

I still use the Gear Fit 2 Pro for working out, though. Guess I don't want to scratch up the Active 2.

The features it has leans more towards a ""smart"" watch over a ""fitness"" watch, but it will more than suffice for the average person who wants to stay fit. Glad to see it can track water and caffeine intake like the Gear Fit 2 Pro ( a big deal for me).

The GPS seems to be spot on for my needs (walking, biking). The GPS turns on, for example, when I turn on the walking app (which the Gear Fit 2 Pro did) and turns off completely when I end my walk (which the Gear Fit 2 Pro did not. I would have to manually turn the GPS off).

Built in alarm is a GREAT plus. Nice selection of apps and the ability to customize watch faces. On my main watch face, I customized it so I can just press ""walk"" on the screen and it counts down from 3 to 0 and just starts working...no searching for the walking app in the fitness apps.

The biggest plus is the battery life. With lots of GPS use, I still get 2.5 days of use every singly time...even got 3 days usage once!

This is the absolutely the best smart/fitness watch I'v owned at this point.

Strange that you can't open the Samsung Health app from the Wearables app as with the Gear Fit 2 Pro. I hope they fix this soon

Samsung did a really good job and I don't think anyone considering the Watch Active 2 can go wrong.

    Sleep tracking is pretty bad
  
",3.0,Steve,"Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2021","









  
  
    
  It's a smart watch. It has a touchscreen and connects to your phone. You know this. Here are the problems I've had with it paired to my Galaxy S9:1. Sleep tracking is indeed as bad as other reviewers have noted. I replaced a dying Fitbit Charge 3 with the Galaxy Active 2, and the tracking is night as day different. The Samsung will almost never record deep sleep, and every once in a while it records nothing. It doesn't matter whether let it auto detect or start your sleep manually. It's bad.2. It frequently stops recording my heart rate during exercise. No rhyme or reason about it; I just get to the end of my workout, check my watch, and see that most of my workout wasn't recorded. This isn't me doing a hard-to-track workout, or waving my arms around wildly or anything. This is walking down the street. It's bad.3. Galaxy watches are locked in to Samsung Fitness. If you have another 3rd party app you like, or you want to keep using the app for your other watch form another manufacturer, you can't. Samsung Fitness is pretty mediocre and comes with it's own set of problems.4. Besides Samsung Fitness, you need the Galaxy Wearable app to configure the watch. Often, GW will open itself and knock out any other app I happen have open. This presents a problem if you want to keep a music or sound effect app running overnight, or walk around with Pokemon GO for instance. I keep GW disabled, but again if you want to make any changes to your watch you need it running.5. A minor annoyance, but I can't find a watch face that doesn't include an unnecessary complication I don't want. My favorite is ""Premium analog"", which is free; it included 3 complications, 2 of which are configurable, and one of which is a stopwatch and only a stopwatch. Don't know why anyone needs a stopwatch always front and center on a watch with scrollable screens, but someone at Samsung thinks you do.I got this watch for only about 50% more than another Fitbit Charge, and it does have more uses, so I'm mostly satisfied. But it's disappointing it fails at the very things I want a smart watch to do. If I had paid MSRP I would have returned it.

  I needed a replacement for a Samsung Fit2 Pro I lost. I was reluctant to spend this much money but the reported performance improvements, the positive reviews and the promise that blood pressure monitoring, along with some other features, that would be added in the very near future, persuaded me to go head. The watch shipped quickly, the packaging was very good and it’s a very nice-looking watch. Out of the box the watch set-up fine and synced with my existing Samsung heath app without missing a beat. The ability to make and take phone calls on the watch seemed a little gimmicky, but I have to admit I use it a lot more than I thought I would, so my first impressions was very good. Unfortunately, that only lasted about 4 weeks, that is when the announcement that the blood pressure features were finally available for download, oh but only if you used a Samsung Phone, which I do not. That same week the pushed watch and Samsung health app updates happened. Several features were removed, the biggest being the weight management feature, it’s gone, and the target daily calories has to be reset every day, which is annoying. But more annoying is the do not disturb feature will turn off the announcement to the watch per the schedule like it should, but does not turn the watch face off, you have to manually turn the good night function on and off. I not sure were Samsung is going with their update, but it appears they are leaning more toward a smart watch and less of a fitness watch. I will more than likely continue to use the watch and hope the next updates will get those features added and useable on a non-Samsung phone.

  This watch is probably the best option for an Android user so I bought it. But it's Samsung at the end of the day so expect poor product support after purchase.The watch has the hardware for an ECG but didn't activate it for a year after the launch. Even now the ECG works only for Samsung phones and not for non-Samsung phones. I bought this watch for the ECG only to wait for a year with still no guarantee that the feature will ever roll out. Also now that the Watch Active 3 has been released, I doubt Samsung would bother with updating the software for an older model. Samsung's continued efforts to sabotage their hardware with their pathetic software makes their product not worth buying or recommending.Will probably never buy a Samsung branded mobile or accessory again.

  As a lifelong Samsung user, I feel that I have to warn other fans such as myself. I have everything from their tvs, appliances, my s10 and this watch.I purchased this watch last black Friday. I ""upgraded"" from my gear s2 to this product which is arguably inferior, but I'll spare that review.My watch inexplicably died one day and would not charge. I used multiple samsung chargers and it would only display zero percent. No problem, its still under warranty and it was returned for service. (Or so I thought)After wasting my valuable time on hold (hung up on/redirected) , I was told that there was water intrusion and that their warranty specifically doesn't cover that. I pled my case that I have no where put this thing through the rigors that Samsung claims it can withstand, so it must have been a defect from the factory. The only time it got wet was when I showered. You are supposed to be able to swim with this thing! It is an ""active"" watch. Just rinse it off if you get seawater or chlorine on it. Yeah, right.With no resolution, my options were to pay $215 for their repair or go without. I chose the latter.I doubt anyone from Samsung will hear my plea's for assistance. An honestly, I dont care. Through my ventures, I have 10s of thousands of dollars in their products and have been a vocal fan boy. No longer.

  I am a android,pixel 3 owner. I previously had a fitbit, my second one that stopped charging correctly so i gave up and decided to look for an android watch. I love the design of this thing. The watch strap itself is super comfy and cool design which is important if you are wearing it all the time, including to bed for sleep tracking. I love how you can change the watch face but there is almost too many designs to chose from. The major problem I have is the whole app use. First as an android user for my phone, should be setup super easy. I had to install like 3 different apps on my phone to get it to work fully. Samsung health app is ok and it looks like it integrates with myfitnesspal but i just wish all this stuff would work together. I hate having to create a samsung account to go to their app store instead of just google play for apps. I am a heavy google user so i got youtube music to work on the watch but why doesn't google photos work? some samsung crap photo app.  Also why can't I use google pay on this? I'm not putting all my credit cards into another samsung pay app so i can use it on the watch.  So far the battery life is pretty bad. seems like i have to charge it every other day right now and i'm not heavily using it. charging is easy except it forget it on the charger. would be better to wirelessly charge it somehow while it's on my wrist. seeing as this is one of the main reasons i gave up on my fitbit which would normally need to be recharged only once a week this is a big fail. other than that great device.

  Bought for use in a health care setting. The ""second"" hand turns off if the watch is not activated. When you flick your wrist a certain way the ""second"" chronograph disappears. This means it fails to be a useful watch, which is the most basic of tasks a watch should be able to preform.Also Samsung does not allow any Google apps on its watch. Meanwhile 100% of Samsung phones run Google apps. If you use apps like YouTube music, Google maps, Google Calendar, Google Fit etc. do not expect them to appear on your watch app list. So not only does it fail at being a basic watch, it also fails at being a smart watch if you use google apps & services.  If you use Google fit with Strava, be prepared to buy a 3rd party app to link them with Samsung Health. The compatibility are not nearly as smooth and seamless as what my GF's iPhone and Apple watch have. Why Samsung chose to make their watches restricted is beyond me.The heart rate monitor seems to work fine. If you use kettle bells or other workout equipment consider using another device to avoid damage.I ended up returning the watch and am now looking at Garmin or just keeping my analogue watch while purchasing a heart rate monitor for use during workouts.

I wanted an (upgrade) from my Samsung gear... I run daily so I know how many calories, on average,I burn in a certain time span... This watch SEVERELY misses the mark when it comes to calories burned... when I run for 20 mins I burn an average of 400 cals (approx) 100 cals every 5 mins... after a 20 mins run with this watch... it only counts 177cals burned which is ridiculous for 20 mins w/ heart rate of 150...I decided to keep the watch because I like how it looks and the other features like being able to take calls, the full texting capability and the vibrant screen etc.. I have not tried it in water and don't plan on it... its just upsetting that its not up to par when it comes to the fitness aspect..If your wanting a watch for fitness ... this is not it AT ALL..Save your money!!!

  Okay I did it and I'm so glad I did! This watch has everything and I did my homework before I purchased and I'm actually blown away how amazing it is in person. My only struggle I had with buying was 40mm or 44mm, I went with 40 since I have a small wrist and the screen is perfect. Probably could have gotten the 44 and it would have been just fine. Your choice your wrist lol but do yourself a favor and get it!

    long battery life

  I replaced my Asus zen3 watch with the Samsung Active 2 watch primarily for longer battery life, swim safe, and pulse monitoring. So far it has lived up to expectations. Finding your app on the phone is much easier than with the Zen3 but still a little clumsy. I have spend lots of time in pool with this watch and no problems so far. I use the pulse monitor for workouts which is easier than using a standalone unit. The battery life is a major plus as it can easily go 2 days without a charge and it can do a 75% recharge in about 2 hours. The apps are colorful and easy to read. Responding to texts and emails is very easy. It answers phone calls with a decent speaker and the microphone seems to work well. It has EKG capability which has been approved by Korea and is built into this phone but will not be active until regulatory issues dealt with. It will involve placing your finger on a button which will act as a 1 lead EKG.  Overall, this is a great watch.  The much more expensive LTE version sounds good but cannot justify especially as you have to get a separate account for it from your cell carrierFinding apps on this watch is not always obvious but once you master them, they are really good.  The exercise monitoring functions are great...especially biking and swimming. The biking function monitors heart zones and duration in each zone, milage, speed, and maps your ride on a map and then transfers it all to your phone for storage.  Swimming keeps tack of number of laps automatically as well as strokes and calories. It even has a little pump function that pumps water out of the watch after you are done swimming.  Bixby is hard coded in but you can ignore it. It displays pictures surprisingly well and music sounds not terrible on its little speaker.

    Won't be covered with Samsung warranty
  
",3.0,Courtney Riddle,"Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2021","









  
  
    
  If it breaks and you bought it on Amazon, Samsung will void your warranty. Samsung has the worst possible customer service. The back cover came off. I just needed them to put it back on. After 3 months I asked them just to send my watch back. They did and didn't include the back.  They then refused to send the back cover to me. Now I can't wear it.

    Great Watch to keep an eye on the heart.

  I have the 44mm BT version. This is my first smart watch and so far I like it a lot. It's very comfortable on my wrist. I tried out the sleep function and it was comfortable to sleep with. It interesting to see how much actual R.E.M. I'm really getting.There were a couple of small updates out the box that were available to address the GPS accuracy and a newer version of Tizen. I tested the GPS with another phone and a 3 mile run was just as accurate as the phone.For some reason the weather app on the  watch couldn't find my location. After some digging on the internet, I've found that the GPS needs to be turned on the watch. It was off by default on my watch. Once you've turned GPS on, go to the Samsung Wearables app on THE PHONE and go to the weather function app and select your city. Then refresh your Samsung Watch Tizen weather app and it will pick up your weather location.I have this watch primarily to keep an eye on my ticker. I know that the echo cardiogram like function for the watch will not be available until early 2020, but it's nice to have an Android watch that eventually will have it.Battery lasts about 1.5 days with heavy usage. 2 days with minimal.For all that this watch does it's a great value.

  Best watch for diabetics to see continuous bg readings! I love it! I had a fossil watch first but with the g-watch app it is perfect!Also the phone option is awesome, I work at a clinic and with covid we have to keep locking the door when people come back into the building... needless to say someone gets locked out and I can use my watch to call for help back in.What i wish is that samsung would allow all apps to update bc I would rather keep this as a widget.

    Watch band is too big, no smaller band provided
  
",1.0,Matthew R. Krueger,"Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  I'm an adult male of normal height in good shape, and the band that comes with this watch is too big. Even at the smallest size the watch flops around on my wrist.Apparently the 40mm watch face comes with a small band. Why not ship that with the 44mm watch face as well? Now I either have to return this watch, or buy a separate band, which I feel that Samsung or Amazon should be reimbursing me for. Apple Watch comes with a smaller band. TicWatch (Wear OS) comes with a smaller band.My first foray in to Galaxy Watches has started off on a terrible foot, and that's before I even have to try to deal with developing apps for Tizen.

  So I was pretty skeptical about buying this watch here due to it having no reviews but I went ahead and ordered it anyway. Shipping was extremely fast and I got the watch the next day and I must say, I love it! Its totally official. Everything a out this watch is amazing from its looks and feel down to it's functionality. Samsung did a really good job with this watch. If your on the fence about buying it go ahead and pick it up you won't regret it.

    Best Watch EVER
  
",5.0,Stephanie Martin,"Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased the Galaxy Active watch 2 in order to keep up with text messages and sleep, it is very worth the purchase. The battery lasts 2-3 days with basic use, Watch is extremely customizable with the app which is amazingly easy to use. This watch can handle a LOT, although it is water resistant I have not gotten in wet. It fits all your needs from an excellent workout tracker, water tracker and more all in a small watch. it did not disappoint.
