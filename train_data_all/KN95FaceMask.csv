  Workmanship appears adequate.  Made in China apparently for Chinese-size heads.  Ear loops are short and uncomfortable but do appear to be well anchored.  Overall measurements seem designed for smaller faces.  Definitely not suitable for beards.  Nose-piece is adjustable but it takes more work to get it to fit properly than flat masks.  I think I could only recommend this for small to medium faces without beards.

  These masks made our throats hurt, even causing canker sores, there is something nasty in these. They are good construction and comfortable, but whatever is in them isn't clean. Used 2 masks total and now it's a waste. Rather wash fabric masks and be blinded by fogged up glasses than have to wear these again. Don't buy.

",2.0,WMJ,"Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2021","









  
  
    
  These mask seems to be of decent quality but they have a small surface area, especially from the top to bottom.  If I move my jaw just a bit, like when talking, the mask will slip down on my nose.  Don't know if they would work for someone with a small face as the ear straps seem to be average length.Have bought other K95 masks that are slightly bigger, just as good if not better quality, and fit perfectly.

  It's a mask....function, rather than fashion, is paramount.  These masks offer full multi-layer protection with just enough interior space to allows for breathing!  Ear loops are comfortable with adequate stretch.  Mask seals comfortably against face for good protection.  And these masks also come with instructions for cleaning!

    Provide more protection
  
",5.0,Gardenia,"Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2021","









  
  
    
  We ordered these and have been wearing them at work for the past 2 weeks. These are KN95 masks and provide much more protection than the cloth or disposable ones we were using. They're comfortable to wear, much easier to breathe, fit snugly around your face while leaving space for you to talk without having to keep repositioning the mask, don't fog your glasses, and fold up neatly when you take them off. They are also reusable. Simply let it air out for a few days before using it again. You can use one, set it aside, use a different one the next day, set it aside, same for a few days, and then start the rotation all over. Don't use soap and water or alcohol-based desinfectant to clean them. Just rotate them, airing them out before using them again.

    Low air flow, they do not have holes punched in them
  
",3.0,Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2021","









  
  
    
  I see it has been written that they have dozens of holes punched in them. I thought so at first as well.But if you look at the outside of the mask in a bright light you will see that the ""holes"" are actually heat welded seams. They reflect light. They are solid heat welded areas that are more transparent, so they can appear to be holes. But they are not holes at all.The masks are comfortable, but they do not pass air nearly as well as what I am used to with a 3M or especially a Moldex N95 mask. Nor do they seal as well around the nose. For me anyway. They suck tight to your face when you breathe in.I'd say they are as good as the typical disposable ""medical"" type mask a lot of people wear and that seem to be acceptable for reducing the risk of contracting bugs. Those don't really seal around the perimeter at all.If the filter medium restricts air more, then more air will slip through the perimeter, thus unfiltered.So I would not wear them around serious risk areas or for construction where you are trying to filter out drywall dust, fiberglass dust, etc.Personally I doubt that they meet the USA N95 specifications.

    5 layer mask, feels safe
  
",5.0,John D. Robles,"Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2021","









  
  
    
  Some have said that these are really 3 or 4 layer masks, but they are not. I cut one apart and easily found four layers,  but by looking close and tearing them apart, the white material inside the black material is two thin layers, so these truly are a 5 layer mask. I have a little trouble being understood sometimes while wearing them, but I would rather have the extra thickness that you don't have with the standard surgical masks. I was double masking as advised by the CDC, but with these masks it is not necessary. They make me feel much safer. One review was written by a nurse who recommended these, and that is a good enough review for me! I recommend these masks.

",1.0,Sim,"Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2021","









  
  
    
  Mask material is very stiff and very scratchy due to the way the seams are sealed. I couldn't wear it comfortably for more than a minute. It also is impossible to get a decent fit even with added strap tighteners - air still leaks (a lot) out of the top.  I'm a big guy, but even so these can't fit. Use a blue procedure mask with a cloth mask over it and if that works for you then you've got more than this mask provides.  Just don't buy this turkey.

",5.0,Matthew Frost,"Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2021","









  
  
    
  These masks fit very nicely on my larger face and my wife's smaller face. As both of us wear glasses, the vertical fold style fits over our noses and when pinched with the built-in metal nosepiece reduces fogging better than anything else we've tried.We wear them under the three-layer washable Gildan cloth masks we bought back in the summer, and the fit saves us from having to try and jam the cloth mask up under our glasses and up against our eyes to get it secure. And the washable cloth masks protect these masks from as much exposure, so we hang them on command hooks to let the germs die, and rotate through a few of them each week. (It helps to number them, so you don't forget which ones you've worn when.)I like that these are fused masks, not stitched—that's what the lighter spots are, the synthetic filter layers have been heat-fused together. And the wider fused base that gives the straps seems to make them much more secure to the mask than other disposables I've used.These seem to be legit, the packaging has its own batch numbering and they come with a stamped slip showing that they're the Chengde masks that have been tested. And it's much harder to smell things when I'm wearing one, even as breathing is not a problem, so I'm going to say they're at least adequate at filtration.

    Too big for smaller faces
  
",2.0,A. N. Drogynous,"Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was hoping to finally find a comfortable n95 or kn95 mask and have a few to spare but these are not one-size-fits-all adjustable. Messing with the nose piece does virtually nothing, I would have to cut around the chin area if I don't want to look like I have jowls. There is no ""seal"" between by face and the mask anyway so I can't use these effectively at work. This size is way too spacious for a thinner faced adult so I'm doubting any child who hasn't been photoshopped would be out of luck as well.

  There are lots of positive reviews here and I don't mean to discredit any of them, but regardless of how comfortable these are, they are NOT on the approved list. There is an image in the product description that shows a letter supposedly from the FDA. While I am not disputing its validity, I did google the EUA number that appears in the letter and it took me to a site which said, in essence, that these are not FDA approved. Having said that I will also add that I am NOT returning mine. These are beautifully made and have many layers. I'm sure it offers adequate protection. I'm only giving it three stars because it is being advertised as if it is an approved KN95 and it is not, so take that into account when ordering.

    Excellent quality but difficult to achieve tight fit due to non-adjustable elastic ear loop band
  
",4.0,Gary Goodnow,"Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2021","









  
  
    
  First, to clear some confusion, these masks are on the FDA EUA list - Chengde is on the list not this specific brand as the list  is by manufacturer not brand.  All Chengde masks, including the WWDoll, ChiSip and others made by Chengde would be approved.The masks seem to be of excellent quality.  5 layers and very well made, yet comfortable and lightweight.  The nose band adjusts nicely to fit the face, or at least as well as they can I think.  I CANNOT make them airtight.  There is leakage at the top near the eyes and in fairness I don't see a way to make these seal completely unless I'm missing something.  But with normal breathing, that is very minimal.My only issue is with the elastic ear loop.  Although wide and more comfortable than most, there is no way to adjust the loop easily and this results in some of the leakage I described above and also causes the mask to slide down the face a bit after an hour or so of wear.  Since all faces are different shapes and sizes, it is a difficult for elastic to be completely effective without an adjustment to take up some slack and I would think Chengde could come up with something without increasing the cost much.  I do not have a small face - I'm 6'1"" with medium build and still had to invent an adjustable loop knot to take up bit of the slack so I could get a tighter fit and it works fine.I still highly recommend the mask with that one caveat.

  I get a good seal and you can tell it is filtering because there is slight resistance and sucking in and out of the material. The straps are softer and wider than less expensive disposables but just the right amount of tension resulting in long term comfort.

  They fit pretty well, better for people with smaller faces, but still not bad for those of us with larger faces. Little foggy with my glasses on, and the nose gap makes it feel much better when wearing. I dont feel like my nose is being crushed. I have severe lung damage, and it feels easy to breath with it on in normal conditions

  I ordered the black masks since they were cheaper, go with everything and are just as effective. I work in person, not remotely so I needed something reliable, thick enough and comfortable to wear all day long. I really like those masks as I did not even need to adjust the elastic as I did with other masks. They cover everything really well and are comfortable enough to wear all day. I have been using them daily for over a week now and I'm very satisfied with this product. I am thinking of ordering some more.

  I am not sure they are any safer than the non rated surgical masks we bought in March. Dr. Fouchi says we need better masks to slow down the spread. I do not understand any of the terms on the mask and I will never trust the Chinese for a long time. I never did.  I wish I could find a box of M-95 3M masks, made in the USA.  These make you look like a duck and steam up my glasses more than the surgical masks we were wearing.

    Paper Maché Masks
  
",1.0,Chris,"Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2021","









  
  
    
  I purchased these because I thankfully had N95s from previous projects but running low and wanted to conserve what was left for potential Armageddon. I knew KN95 would not be as effective but still a plausible alternative. However, these masks are no different if not worse than the disposable blue paper masks. In terms of viability, it is a mask which should provide protection to others from you, but the reverse seems impractical. They're extremely thin and though it has holes it's supposed to be ""filtered.""  Not sure I buy it.  I've tried the lighter test and it held up. Tried fragrance test and had no issues smelling anything. There's practically no seal.  If you need a mask just to have one there are more cost effective alternatives, save your money.

  Would not fit 3 different faces.  Severe leaks at top.  Noticed it first when our glasses fogged worse than in any other mask.  We actually felt, and couldn't stop, exhaled air blowing into our eyes.At first, we thought they were perfect; extremely easy to breathe.  However, when sealing them by holding them down to our faces, as expected, they became just as difficult as any N95 or KN95 mask.  Further, without sealing them by hand, inhaled air simply bypasses the mask thru the same gaps.Might be improved by upgrading the bendable nose piece.  The existing one isn't strong enough to hold its shape.It also does seem to extenuate the bird beak look.  This is becoming more common with foldable masks, but this one did elicit laughter from those who knew me well enough not care if they embarrassed me!  Ha, ha, ha!All complaints aside, the company is exceptionally good to work with and the mask seems like a high quality product.  They responded immediately and 100% satisfied me by going above and beyond with superb customer service.  They offered no excuses, had no questions other than, ""How can we make you happy and we hope you'll give us another chance to serve you.""So if you think they might fit, give them a try.  In my experience, they'll stand behind their product so you really have nothing to lose.

It is a snug fit for my size head/face.  The elastic is not for those with those with a large head/face.

  Google ""Chendge technology and CDC KN95"" the resulting pdf indicates that the filter material is appropriate and effective, but that no manufacturing certification has been supplied and the fit might be ineffective.

  The last thing I wanted to buy were KN-95 masks made in China. The shortage of N-95 masks made in the USA made it necessary. The masks were well packaged, with several smaller packages containing several masks each.  Even thought he masks make you look like a you have a duckbill, that’s OK. It allows them to be easily folded and out in your pocket. They fit fairly tightly to the face and are a bit more difficult to breath through than a paper surgical masks, but that’s part of the price of the extra protection. My only real complaint is they itch on the skin. I don’t have sensitive skin, but after a few minutes there is a low-grade persistent itch. I can and will wear it, but not looking forward to an upcoming long air flight. My wife flat out won’t wear it and is going to go with a regular paper mask. We have friends with similar complaints  and they wear the KN-95 on top of a paper mask. Just got the masks last week and haven’t given two masks routine a try yet since I find it a touch difficult to breathe. through it anyway. But plan to try it this week. If they can figure out how to reduce the itch, then it’s a decent product, assuming it’s doing what it’s supposed to.

  These claim to be 5 ply, but are actually 4 ply - indicating to me that they are counterfeit. As other reviews have mentioned, the portions where the straps attach to the mask are suspicious - there is only 1 layer of fabric there.Additionally, the fit is not very good. On several different instances, this mask has caused irritation on my left ear due to tightness. I know N95's (and presumably KN95's) need to be tight to the face to be effective, but I've never had comfort issues like this with any other type of mask. I assume it's due to poor design.

",5.0,Dylan Djani,"Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  Got my pack in the mail today and confirmed the manufacturer first (Chengde Technology Co. KN95, indeed listed in FDA's Appendix A (EUA authorized non-NIOSH approved respirator), which was on the back of the packaging, as well as on a package insert (see photos). I also confirmed the model was marked as GB2626 - 2019 on the packaging and on the masks.Overall, I was impressed by the quality of the masks - they seem higher quality and are more comfortable than others I've bought.However, most importantly, the masks made a good seal on my face with just the ear loops.  Adding on an ""ear protector"" mask strap definitely made an adequate seal around my face, similar to the seal made with the Powecom FFP2 with the headband straps (without the ear loops).

  I have no desire to come to an early demise, nor do I want to be the asymptomatic community member spreading this virus to innocent people just going about their necessary business.

  These masks are a great fit. There is no gapping on the sides or around the nose piece. The cone shape makes breathing easy in this mask. A good value for 25 masks.

The loops are just barely on there. I don't know if it's the way they attached him or their dry rotted but when I reapply my mask two or three times one of the ear loops pulls apart and comes off. I'm on third pair I'm not even through the day yet. I bought these because I thought they were a great quality and I could at least wear one mask in a day maybe two. I am very disappointed in this mask coming apart. I pray the rest of the mass don't fall apart. This is my second order for Mass my first order never made it from another company and I was glad to see this one made it in a timely fashion. The wearing my first mask and then have to put a second and third one on before the day is up was very discouraging I'm going to have to try another brand.Like I said the mask itself is well made it's the ear loops that's the problem I'm going to try to staple it together see if I can get some more use out of it that's really going to look weird.

  After wearing this, you will question the value of your cloth mask. Naturally air intake takes a bit more effort - as a healthy person it is fine for me. The air passage so filtered that breathing out tends to leak just a bit under my eyes. I feel much more protected at the grocery store than with a cloth mask.

I bought these after seeing a report for NK95 being the best after N95, so I bought the pack of 30. The product is so misleading and lacks the protection it claims to have. The only positive thing about it is being comfortable.

  I was wondering if the mask was authentic so I gave it the water test... put a bit of water in it to see if it holds.  Because if it lets water leak, it *certainly* will let respirated particles leak!I put a bit of water in it, and after about 15 seconds it came through, a very pronounced drip.

  I have a small face, so I wish these came in more sizes than just one. Other than that one complaint, these work great.The metal nose band works more or less to help with glasses fog. The band is inside of the mask instead of being glued to the top, like other KN95’s. This makes them easier to reuse, if needed. My other KN95 masks had metal bands that became unglued or straight up just broke. As a glasses-wearer, this feature is important! These are harder to breathe in, but I take that as a good sign since I suppose this means they’re actually filtering out the air of dust and pathogens.My main reason for getting these masks is because I work as an essential worker where 6ft social distance isn’t always easy to maintain. And even when there is proper distancing, one can never be too sure! Better safe(r) than sorry.Bonus points: these come in black, which fits my aesthetic.

  Seems well made, but I should’ve looked at the photos better; these cut uncomfortably close under your eyes. There’s no curve, so it sits right under your eyes, and I couldn't stand wearing it for more than a few minutes. Also, the nose clip is weak, so it doesn’t do anything to create a seal. Both my husband and I found it annoying. Another thing is there’s a gap under my chin, I can easily fit two fingers, and no matter how I adjusted it, there was still a gap. Also, because the bottom is structured, any time you move your head, it also moves the mask up. I would suggest buying a smaller pack to see if these are for you. Not one size fits all.

  Real N95 masks have straps that go around the entire head, allowing for a custom fit. These have elastic loops. Worse still, the loops are far too tiny for an adult male (and perhaps an adult female as well). The loops will pinch your ears making for a painful way. The tiny loops also make it more likely for the mask to slip, making these quite dangerous. At this price point, they could have easily included proper head loops that go around the back of the head. Instead, they pinched pennies, pinched ears, and have lost this customer. DO NOT BUY THESE MASKS. THEY ARE FLAWED AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS.

I believe these should be labeled S/M -- they will work for children and at least some women, but I don't think you're going to find a lot of six foot tall guys who can wear these.Took a long time to arrive.

  I'm teaching myself to breathe a little differently in these since I'm switching from a cheap 2 ply medical style mask. They are heavier and the airflow isn't as easy, which is a good thing in a pandemic. They are also a little on the small size so trying to keep it over your chin and nose properly if you have a long face is not optimal. I will continue to use them until we don't have to though.

  I bought these masks as my wife and I headed out to San Diego during Thanksgiving week. I didn't want to chance using the thin blue masks for a long flight out to California and then back to the DC area. Comfort is about medium as the ear loops take their toll on your ears. I wish the seal was better as the mask itself will all of a sudden start leaking air from around your nose and cheeks. My wife's glasses were fogging up randomly even after adjusting the nose strip. I honestly did feel safer with the thickness of the mask. The size of the package was perfect for our trip. We had plenty to use on the plane ride there and back and while out and about. Other than the fact you need to relieve the pressure on your ears and adjust the nose strip to reseal the mask back to your face every 15-20 minutes or so, I’d say these masks are pretty good.

  The masks look great, but the metal strip to seal them around the nose is a poor match for Asian noses. The metal strip around 1 cm from the edge, which means the mask either sits too high (and intrudes on the eyes) or is too low. Either way, I can't get it to seal properly.

  I was initially impressed at how well this mask was fitted and sealed to my face. The mask is definitely breathable. Then, I noticed the horizontal rows of open holes just above and below the KN95 imprint (see promo pic). The holes are much larger than typical bandana fabric cloth has. The fact is, I can clearly see the skin of my finger through the holes. The seal around the face is also full of a row of such holes. So, I think while this mask might protect others from your coughs etc., it is unlikely to fully protect you from Covid-19 in close quarters where an infected person has been coughing, singing, or yelling a lot. it is not because of the lack of layers but because protection seems to be at least somewhat defeated by the designed rows of holes. The mask seems LIKELY to be better than wearing nothing... perhaps just barely. I will not purchase these again.

They cover my face from under my eyes to well under my chin, so the overall size is good—if only they weren’t pinchy around my nose. I’ll still make use of them.

  These are the best disposable masks I’ve tried. According to the literature on mask testing, they are a good replacement for N95 masks. You just need to ensure the ones your buying are on the FDA approved listing. I find them more comfortable then any other mask I’ve tried. Because of the construction, mask only touches along thes sealing edge leaving the end of your nose an lips in untouched in the interior open space. Also, so far, fogging of my glasses is a rare, temporary event.

  The short of it is that I can't get a good seal, particularly around my eyes.

  I have been waiting and searching patiently for the quality of mask for my own protection. Now that the medical experts are recommending that everyone resort to “double-masking” and to stop using those unreliable “cloth-masks” these KN-95 masks are extremely necessary to make things much safer for myself during this PANDEMIC. I sincerely believe that whether you are a health professional working on the front lines or not, everyone should be afforded the same protection in order to control the spread of infections as best possible. The first step to this end is the personal practice of protection for one’s own self which means what quality of masking is being utilized. The continued hand-washing and social distancing must also be observed without exception. I also believe that even after one has been fortunate enough to receive a COVID VACCINE SHOT that all these precautionary practices should be continued no matter what.

  I love these masks - they are the only ones I will wear right now. They are a bit more pricey than other masks, but you're paying for quality and those promising lab results. I adore it's filter of efficiency of 95% or more, and its five layers.  The extra space gives this mask its signature ""duck face"" look, but also makes it feel more breathable. The nosepiece is easy-to-use, and the mask ""molds"" to the shape of your face the more you wear it. The ear bands do not put that much pressure on my ears. If they do irritate you, I recommend stretching each one a bit before using again.  I use these masks in school, at the store, and more. I even ran with them a few times. I typically replace them once a week, as I only use them a couple times per week. It depends on how often you use it and where they're being used.  I highly recommend these masks.

  Tight fit that loop over your ears and provide a good seal though enough air escapes that your sunglasses or glasses still fog up a bit.

They give me a bit of a headache after wearing for awhile but still wearable and make us feel safer, layering under a surgical or cotton mask.The ""holes"" other reviewers point out aren't holes, no air escapes or gets in through them, they're merely heat sealed areas created by the manufacturing process, no worries there.

  The mask covers the nose and mouth securely, feels comfortable for the most part except that the bridge of the nose, the fabric will flip over and it will rub your nose raw. I'm a massage therapist and I do plenty of talking educating my patients and scheduling appointments. This little problem makes me feel the need to take my mask off and touch, not only my face but my mask to ""fix"" it. It's is light in weight so it doesn't sit heavy on your face so that adds to the comfort. I'm claustrophobic and this mask doesn't hinder my breathing with its stretch. Although with taking it on and off in an attempt to ""fix"" the nose problem, the elasticity of the bands will weaken. I have pulled on these bands, on a new mask, to have it break; I didn't feel I pulled too hard. I use a mask extender so I can pull the mask on and off over my head rather than wrapping it around my ears. This also wears down the elasticity of the bands thus making it to slightly slip off the nose.I feel safer wearing this mask than others knowing it securely covers my nose and mouth compared to other masks; even with the nose problem. I will also add that not every mask out of this pack causes the nose problem I'm mentioning. Which kind of adds to any frustration you may already have regarding wearing a mask. I will buy again.

  This mask is problematic unless you have a small circular face. The material is rather stiff and on larger faces, or faces that aren't round, it will be difficult to get a good seal and the mask will slip and slide, usually downwards.

  I had a box of real N95 masks by 3M from before the pandemic started.  They fit comfortably and tightly against my face all around my nose, cheeks, mouth, and chin - as though they were designed for my face.  However, these particular KN95 masks do not fit tightly against my face at all.  Significant air leaks in and out, bypassing all filtering material.  Regardless of how good the filtering material is, it does no good for all that air that leaks around it.  By the way, at the beginning of the pandemic, I donated my remaining N95 masks to a local hospital.

",1.0,Stefan ,"Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2021","









  
  
    
  The straps are too loose and don't hold the mask properly. Works when you inhale, but when you exhale due to the air resistance the mask gets pushed from your face and exhaled air is not filtered. This works to protect the user, but defeats any protection for others. If you wear glasses, you are 100% guaranteed they will fog up when you exhale. My face size is pretty average, but the lack of any seal other than the nose clip really prevents this mask from working properly.

The mask fits great on the face and covers all areas as it should. I could breath without difficulty and because it is away from your face somewhat in the center of the mask it does not tickle the nose.

  At work for a municipality, I received a KN95 masks that has Chinese writing and GB2626-2006 printed on them, they seem a lot better than these.Problems:Thickness: feels a lot thinner than the 5-ply mask I received from work, despite claiming it has 5 plys.  I would cut one open to find out, but I'm going to return them because that's how disappointed I amNose Clip:  The nose clip is made from a lot thinner metal than other masks and because of that, doesn't have the strength to create a good seal, and because of that....Seal:  the seal around the nose is horrible, due to the thin metal nose clip. No matter what I try, I cannot create a seal around my nose, and can feel the air rushing past both sides of my nose into my eyes, and not a tiny bit, a tremendous amount.  Although I do not wear glasses, I would imagine that these would cause them to fog up pretty badly.I cannot express how truly frustrating and aggravating it is to try and find a quality mask on Amazon, and considering your health is literally on the line (and like me who has their 70+ year old mother with preexisting conditions staying with them) and that of a loved one.  Unfortunately I work a job where I come into close contact with numerous people every day, and though they wear masks, they're nothing but single layer cloth coverings I don't put much faith in.What's worse is that Amazon will not allowregular consumers to buy any of the NIOSH approved masks, so we're basically forced to walk a mindfield of cheap, Chinese knockoffs with misleading claims and probably fake reviews.  And even when the reviews are legitimate, it seems as though some people have a much different opinion on what constitutes a quality mask than I do.  A lot of reviews claimed this is a good mask, and I honestly can't see how they came to that conclusion other than that they're probably comparing it to a cloth face covering you buy at a box store, because if you compare this with a decent KN95 mask, it seems like a napkin or a toy.This was my first attempt at trying a KN95 mask from Amazon, and when I was making the gamble on which to pick, I'd come across products like these where most of the reviews were good, with a few bad ones.  I wrote off the bad ones thinking they were just being way too picky or crazy, and now I realize I was wrong... The negative reviews are right, and the positive ones are wrong.
