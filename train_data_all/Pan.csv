  Very disappointing. Not non-stick. I fried an egg and on purpose did not use any butter or non-sick spray. The egg stuck and left a mark. I would not recommend this pan. It’s pretty, but the maker has lied about the non-stick.

    Odd Handle; Made in China
  
",3.0,KSO,"Reviewed in the United States September 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  First of all, misleading ad: this is MADE IN CHINA--not Switzerland.  I wish I had researched it a bit more carefully before purchasing.  As for the pan itself, it's a nice size.  The handle has a really weird feel.  It looks like fake wood and has an oddly soft yet firm texture.  I'm not sure how the handle will hold up over time...

  Would put zero star if I could. This is definitely NOT a non-stick pan. Sprayed oil to pan to cook fried eggs a couple of times.

  This is my 1st pan of this kind. I'm very pleased. I'm not sure I would go with light-colored wood, because any grease splatter will seep into the wood handle, but whatever.As far as a nonstick, it definitely is. And the heat distribution is great, everything cooks super evenly. Seems durable. Not much to say, when my other large nonstick dies I'm gonna get a large one of these.

    Beware induction use
  
",3.0,V Bower,"Reviewed in the United States March 27, 2019","









  
  
    
  This is a great pan for use on other than an induction cook top.  Whether the plate on the bottom, or the material used to make the pan, it does not work well on induction.  It cooks very slowly - had to turn the burner up to medium - medium high to cook an egg.  If the pan gets moved at all, the burner turns itself off, leaving the food cooking to stop.  I returned this one and a larger version that I purchased to Amazon.  That said, the non-stick coating works perfectly and I absolutely loved the the handle.  If you cook on anything but induction, this is a great pan.  Just not good for induction.

    Texture like a brick but absolutely the best non-stick (aside from my seasoned cast iron)
  
",5.0,Lee Earle,"Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  After a poor experience with an expensive, kitchen specialty mall store omelet pan, I tried this one.  Surely such an inexpensive pan couldn't do the job.Boy, was I surprised. Pleasantly.  This pan is solid, thick, and smooth - much more value than many higher priced utensils.  Seriously, I cleaned the pan the first three times with a paper towel - period.  It's amazing.I'm not kidding about the brick-like texture.  I closed my eyes and ran my fingers over the inner surface - brick!  How it manages to be so fabulously non-stick I simply cannot explain.  I just love it.Only one small complaint; the care advisory is printed on the backside label in WHITE TYPE ON ORANGE BACKGROUND!  The paragraphs almost disappear.  And it's about 6-point (small print), magnifying glass type.  So to the packaging designers, a big fail.Buy the frying pan anyway.

  I spent weeks researching to find a pan that's light and non-stick as well as durable. It is very hard to find I like this one but still were in trial phase to see what it can do. The handle I do not trust very well not to break. Since the first one that shipped to me was already broken so be aware when you're transporting the food in it. At this stage it is wearing well and Performing well Cooks evenly Fry's well and I'm enjoying the Easy to Clean feature. The people complaining probably beat up there kitchenware.I do not.

    Disappointing after my other Carote Nonstick Frying Pan
  
",1.0,Miray Yuce,"Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  I first bought an 11"" one, which is great. Non-stick, easy to clean and everything you could ask for.However this 9.5"" one is very different than my previous one. Even if it's non-stick eventually, things stick at first even with a lot of oil. I have to scratch them with a silicon spatula. My guess is that the heat distribution is not evenlyThe other problem is that when the pan is heating on low/medium heat, it makes a cracking sound, which is scary. I've never heard such a thing from an empty, new and cold/warm pan! The noise keeps coming. I don't know what is wrong with this item, but it certainly shouldn't have passes a quality checkIt's too bad that I already used the item, so I don't know if they'd accept a return. I don't recommend this product as a cracking sound is the last thing you expect from a pan

  I purchased the 11 inch skillet, received it yesterday and cooked a meal in it later in the day. No care instructions or any other information were included with it. I Googled ""Carote care instructions""  & found little available for this particular brand, only generic information.I washed it in hot soapy water, dried and spread a thin coat of oil over the interior, and let it heat on a medium low gas flame for about 5 minutes in order to season it a bit.Later, I cooked a taco ground beef/rice dinner in it and clean up was a breeze. After drying, I applied another thin coat of oil and put it away until next time. So far, so good.

  Bought 8"" on ten dollar special. Followed cleaning and oil instructions but, while it looks nice and the handle stays cool, it is NOT non-stick and does perform worse than the standard smooth/teflon coated pans I have.  Smooth coatings generally have less surface area so this rugged ""granite"" coating does not live up to the marketing hype. Sorry, returning this one to avoid Swiss holes in my budget.

  So I needed to replace an old Teflon non-stick pan. I spent a couple of minutes checking out the new non-stick coated pans. This one had very good reviews and was the perfect size for eggs and omelets. I went ahead and pulled the trigger and am glad I did so. When making eggs/omelets I always throw in a bit of butter to grease the pan. With the old Teflon pan I would sometimes get spots that stuck. That is not at all the case with this pan. Nothing sticks to it. It is always very easy to flip your eggs. The pan performs as good as it looks. If you are looking for a small frying pan I highly recommend this one.

  heavy construction so the heat distribution is good.  cooks evenly and the non-stick feature works very well.  when cooking eggs a bit of oil really keeps them sliding.  surface has a rougher texture than i'm used to in a non stick but it works really well.  I am considering purchasing another one in another size with a glass lid so I can steam items as well.

  The pan looks nice and and the handle feels good but it ends there. Used it for the first time this morning to make some scrambled eggs and it didn't come out too well. First, the pan sticks! I used about 2-3 tablespoons of olive oil and the eggs still stuck! Second, the handle started to turn yellow right where it touches the pan and it started to ""burn"" because there was a distinct rubbery smell. Third, it was difficult to clean because of the ""rough"" granite the pan is made out of. Returning this product!

    Frying pan process flawed
  
",3.0,Carlene A.,"Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  This frying was wonderful until the small amount of oil or butter you use keeps sweeping through the bottom onto the stove top making a burned mess on top. This happens in the same small spot on the bottom. This is the first frying pan I have ever used that nothing sticks to it even after 3-4 months. The finish is still like new, I followed directions for use and have never used high or even medium heat. Somewhere in the process of sealing the finish failed that is why I gave it 3 stars. Love the frying pan otherwise.

  I've owned a lot of non-stick pans in my life.  This is the best. Leagues better than any other. When I bought it I thought the handle was wood. It is not. It is some type of siliconized plastic. The handle cleans easily and is supposed to take 350 degrees F. Just to name a few,  I've owned Farberware, Calphalon, T-Fal, Cuisinart, Oxo, the stupid green ceramic Eco-Pan that lasted one use before it began to ""stick."" Usually I get 12-24 months out of a pan before it's ruined (usually by a family member accidentally scratching it with the point of a knife). But the coatings on all of the other pans I've owned seem ""soft"" and after a few months use, the surface has changed (water doesn't bead up on them). This coating is superior. I use it 1-4 times a day, and its just like the first time I used it. I also own a bunch of cast iron pans, but they are not very non-stick when cooking acidic foods like tomatoes and tomatillos. This pan is; and I love it. It was on sale for $11 when I bought it. I did not get paid for this review.

  This pan is so good that even though it was bent out of round from shipping and missing a screw holding in the handle, I am only docking it one star.  If it was round and had that screw? Total 5 stars. One of the nicest pans I have.Wish I could find a lid for it that fits it, but like I said, it's not really round anymore. Not worth returning, I don't think, since I use it near daily anyway.  So there's that!  If your pan comes to you with no shipping shenanigans, you will be thrilled. If it comes like mine, you will be happy anyway, but slightly wistful that in a better time line, your pan would be in pristine shape before and after cooking.Oh, and I had to switch from metal spatulas and spoons to plastic or wood.  Which is always a good idea, anyway.

  Over the years, I've used many other nonstick pans with traditional nonstick coatings. Even though I used nylon and wooden utensils, kept heat at medium temperatures, and stored the pans carefully, the cooking surfaces of these pans soon were damaged and discolored. The nonstick feature of the pans deteriorated far too soon, as well. The  Carote 8 inch skillet is a perfect size for cooking smaller amounts of food...an omlet for one, a single burger, a couple slices of bacon for a BLT (cut slices in half).The granite coating is holding up quite well. The pan is well built. I am very satisfied with this purchase

  I had first written a glowing review based on its overall appearance and look, before having used it. I pretty much cook myself daily for dinner an omelette which is more like a Spanish tortilla than omelette, i.e., made with egg whites and I mix inside all kinds of veggies and rice, so what I do, I flip it over, because it is thick, I don't fold it. I had been doing that with my old skillet which gave me no trouble but had started flaking on the outside something awful, and I made the mistake of throwing it away when I received this one. I tried every trick in the book and then some, but the ""non stick"" is not working. That is, I flip the omelette over with no trouble, but the final stage, which should be quick, always invariably sticks in the center. So I guess it's the skillet's fault, because come on, I have been cooking these tortillas daily over a decade or more, first with teflon and then stoneware skillets, and never a problem. Problems started with this particular skillet, driving me crazy and frustrated, whereI should sit down to enjoy my meal in peace. So I ordered another brand skillet yesterday and hope to have better luck. Or else I will have to change the menu....

  After reading negative reviews from people alleging they experienced problems with the non-stick feature, I have found NO problems whatsoever. The pan works absolutely great.I’ve cooked eggs, omelettes and chicken tenders in the three days since I’ve had this pan. There is zero problem cleaning it afterwards; and if you heat properly (and add some oil or butter) there is NO Issues or problems with the non-stick. Also The heat is evenly dispersed, heats evenly and cooks very fast (Update: oil or butter is optional as it still is non-stick without.)I would highly recommend this pan!

  EGGS for instance. If you use high heat and don't use a bit of oil/butter/spray then you may get some sticking. It cleans up very easy, but if you're making an omelet and hoping you can flip the thing without using some grease, prepare to be disappointed. I have never bought a so-called ""nonstick"" item that truly can be used without some oil to have sticky things just slide out of the pan.  That being said, this pan is super high quality! I didn't expect something this nice for the price. It's my every day egg pan, and I also use it for heating up small batches of food that I don't want to microwave.  Good quality for the price. Small but useful heavy duty pan. I like it.

  I bought this for my spouse who “needed it”, and by that I mean I accidentally burned the crap out of the OXO Teflon 10” pan and need to replace it so he could effortlessly make scrambled eggs again. He struggles with the stainless steel set we have and wanted something easier to clean than the cast iron. It is the easiest to clean of all the pans I’ve ever encountered in my entire life.I got the 12” with the glass lid and am so pleased with it. It takes a couple minutes for it to preheat, longer than my stainless steel, and about the same amount of time as my cast iron, but that’s no bother. My spouse does not preheat it and it still serves his purposes, but I wanted to see if I could brown some meat on it, hence the preheating and it was effective.It appears to be very well made. I think we’ll be holding onto it for years to come. It’s also quite nice to look at.

  I tried one of those ""As seen on TV"" copper ""nonstick"" pans. Within two weeks the copper pan had food stick to it worse than any other pan in the house! Not so with the granite pan. I did my homework and found a pan that everyone seemed to agree is actually nonstick. It's 100% true. I don't do crazy things like placing caramel or cheese in the pan by itself, but I do make scrambled eggs with cheese. The cheese that came in contact with the pan came right out.  I personally use butter in the pan for flavor, but I'm  pretty sure the pan would still be nonstick without it. I recommend for anyone whose tired of scraping frying pans and for those who got suckered into buying an ""As seen on TV"" frying pan.

  It is non-stick, but not teflon coated. I didn't have any complaints for the first month and a half. I made steaks in it like I always do, but this time 4.5 on my induction cooktop was too high and it burnt, not seared, my steaks. The inside of the pan is discolored because of it. I just made an omelette in it though, and nothing stuck.

  What we have here is a premium piece of stone cookware. The second you unearth it from its packaging, if you care a whit about craftsmanship, you will be tempted to embrace it like your strong & stoic firstborn babe. Get one of these sturdy zeniths of industrial design and two well-seasoned cast irons, and your stovetop is set for life. This robust pan is exceptionally easy to clean - no sticking - and free of discoloration. No carcinogenic nastiness that we know of. Very difficult scorch, though, of course if you really put your mind to it, you can. The only time I saw it take permanent damage was when it was left on an burner turned to max for approximately 40 min. Even still, it was usable afterward & there's been no problem with quality of use.It is somewhat convex - someone pointed that out with ire. Oil pools in a little moat around the center, but the island is still close to sea level subject to flooding. I haven't found any pans like this that aren't that way, but maybe there's some secret utopia of perfectly flat pans known only to advance chefs inducted into the Holy Order of Non-Convex Cookware. Frankly, I haven't been looking for this, so maybe it's more common than I think. Either way, the pan isn't so convex that it's challenging to cook with. It cooks perfect eggs if you act as the brains of the partnership. It does still require you to do some of the thinking, but the bright side is that you aren't out of a job yet.Treat this splendidly crafted little pan with proper care & you shan't go wanting.Edit: it's been brutally scorched 3 times due to inane misuse and is still fully functional. The pan is very impressive. The cook, arguably less so. When this weary trooper is laid to rest under a little stoneware tombstone in the backyard, I will order 2 more just like it. There's no need to get any other sort of egg pan ever again, probably.

  The pan works great and is a good deal for the price. My only issue is on my gas stove the flame hits the plastic handle and is causing the base of the handle to fail. Its not really melting but small bits pop off if it gets too hot leaving the handle loose and pitted. I think it would work better on an electric range or a small gas range.

  OK, I get it. Teflon is bad for you. Probably not good for the environment. But I have not found a suitable “non-stick “equivalent to Teflon. I mean, I love my cast-iron, but that’s not for every application. I was hopeful about this brand, and had intended to buy a set. Thought I’d start with just one pan and see what I thought. Thoroughly disappointed.First, I was very surprised that it isn’t smooth. Little white dots are a texture. But I moved on. The first couple of uses it seem to work just fine.  Fried an egg over medium heat no stick no residue nothing. But after the first few uses, it’s poor quality quickly became apparent. The handle isn’t wood but plastic and rapidly discolored. After about 10 to 15 uses it is now no longer any kind of non-stick. I called this now full-stick. What you see in the image is a couple of scrambled eggs cooked in some oil over medium heat.  Soaked pan in soapy hot water for four hours. This will require significant scrubbing. Does not just wipe out.  I am done here. The search continues…

  Skillet or pan is easy to use and surprisingly light weight for it's design. Some small pans that get good heat distribution are too heavy to use comfortably. This pan is light weight and produces good results.It eliminates my concerns using it on my glass stove top. The handle being heat resistant is nice feature too. When I can throw my omelet in the oven in the same pan to keep eggs warm or to just finish melting cheese I cannot complain about my cookware. It is my go to pan for small frying on my stovetop.

  This pan is described as non-stick. It is NOT a non-stick. I used the skillet six times over three weeks to cook eggs, sliced ham, and a hamburger patty. I followed the directions that came with and found that I had to scrub it hard  each time with a soft sponge made for skillets such as this one. After six times of hand-washing it there are spots inside that won't come out. Plus, the bottom and exterior sides are stained and and the stains won't come clean. As I said, I followed the directions for cleaning, too, and I gave up. Oh, and I almost forgot--the wooden handle is now loose where it attaches to the body of the pan.

  So far this has been the best nonstick frying pan we have bought.  Great heat distribution, easy to clean and for my money a great value. (That said, I have a 9 1/2 inch Carote pan skillet that quickly became not quite so great as the cooking surface turned brown....after just a few months of use.)  That said, I have replaced it with another 9 1/2 inch skillet from Carote with the hope that the discoloration  was a fluke.

  Recently I have been making lots of omelettes with fresh eggs from my chickens and I wasn’t sure I’d like this pan, or that it would work ok considering the low price point. But I decided to try it, and I love it. Makes a great cheese cracker, and a great omelette. It is a bit too bumpy for a good crepe, so I wouldn’t use it for that. But excellent for omelettes. It does pop when it is cooling, but so far there has been no damage to the material, and it washes easily. It looks very cute as well.

  I love this pan! I originally bought it to start alternating my breakfast and, on occasion, having an egg for breakfast instead of cereal which has been my go-to breakfast for years. I have used it a lot since then and I'm very pleased with it. Eggs and other food cook more quickly in it than they do in my other, copper pan. It's also extremely durable and I don't have to worry about using it on a hot stove as I do with my other pan.It's also very easy to clean, no matter what I occasionally burn into it. My other pan has a coating, that wears off, that I have to be very careful cleaning. Not so with this pan. Whatever it's mad eof makes it easy to clean but if you do have to scrub a little you can do so without worrying about scraping the non-stick coating off. This pan doesn't have a non-stick coating; it just doesn't stick.

  Awesome pan for the money!  Read other reviews.  Who cares about slight discoloring of the handle, if that even happens.  Keep stove top at medium or below and you won’t have a problem with this pan.  I’m using a gas range and haven’t had any issues with the pan whatsoever.  I’ve used it for two months now, still looks like new.  If someone says they use their burner on med or below and they have issues with warping, peeling or anything else, they probably have the wrong gas fitting in their stove.  Probably running a natural gas fitting while burning with propane.  Much hotter than medium or lower on a stove setup properly.

  I've never tried a pan with this kind of coating, usually preferring stainless steel, but I thought I'd give it a try. So far it's been perfect; it cleans up well, it has a nice weight and heats evenly, and I love the handle.One thing that I hate in a frying pan is if the bottom isn't flat, which is what happens to all the cheap ones. So far so good on this one - I use it on a glass-topped stove and it's dead-flat still. At one point I was frying some chicken and got called away for about 45 minutes, during which the oil burned off, the pan got very hot and the kitchen filled with smoke (stupid me, I know). Cleaning up afterward was still a breeze, a little soak in soapy water and the black came right off, pan still looks like new, and still dead-flat.

  A two hundred dollar non-stick pan needs oil, butter, or something to keep anything truly non-stick. No exception here. So far, this pan is working great after everyday use for a month. No warps, no sticking, and if you have gas you'll have good even cooking. Not so much with electric burners. As with most non-stick, try to avoid high heat for prolonged times. Heat your pan first, use EVOO,or butter, put your food in the pan and don't move it around until it cooks a little. Then flip and so on. I 've bought $90 Cuisinart non-stick pans and they last about 2 years, so we'll see how this Granite Stone pan holds up over time.

  I really like this pan. It's covered with rock, is that right? Foods taste better! One reason might be you don't need to put the heat on full blast as with other non-stick pans. Medium heat is all you need because it heats well all over, and fast. You are forced to treat it with respect because when you wash it, you can't scrub the suds off hard with bare hands, the surface being ""gritty."" Also, you know, with other standard non-stick pans, if you like to rinse the pan before putting in the oil, the water always remains so the oil splatters? Well, with this rock-pan, you shake it and every drop of water comes off. And when you fry something, you don't need to put in as much oil. Of course the main thing is how long this pan will last, but I am happy with it now for the main reason that foods just taste better. I made Korean scallion-pork-flour ""pancake"" on it, and it came out far better than on a standard non-stick pan.

  These are the two pans I use daily.  They are excellent, but follow the suggestions about how to use them.  They are great at low and medium temps.  Those are the two I use.  Using a dab of oil is recommended.  Do it.They are also terrific with the lids on.

  I loved this pan for a year, up to very recently. Now all the nonstick coating is gone and my food gets burnt all the time from sticking to the pan. Also heat doesn't get equally distributed anymore. So I have to buy a new set of frying pan now which is annoying. But if you are looking for a cheap, functioning pan for short term, this is a great one.

  Ignore any review on here that's under a few months. Within several months this pan will no longer be non-stick. Even worse it will lose its non-stick coating exposing you to the chemicals from which the pan is made (made in China.) I emailed the company to ask if it was still safe to use and received no response.  This tells you everything you need to know... about both the pan and the company selling this.

  After a week of use I’m unclear how other reviewers state this is non-stick. I’ve cooked an egg without any oil and it not only sticks but burns to the surface. I’ve cooked eggs with oil and it sticks to the pan at any nook where there isn’t any oil. Quality pan? Yes, even though the first use a bad smell emanated that I isolated to be the glue between the handle and the pan itself. Could I have a bad pan? Am I so conditioned to Teflon pans that are far superior for non-stick that I don’t appreciate this unique pan? I don’t know. I’m disappointed.

  Bought this to replace a non-stick pan that was no longer non-stick.  This is an awesome pan.  Nothing sticks, clean up is so quick (even if it's a cheesy dish),  and the handle stays cool.  It is deeper than I thought it would be which was just an added bonus.

  It was something if not nothing, this pan.  When it arrived, I was concerned as it did not include any inserts, product information, or packaging.  Only a thin plastic bag.  And there was no padding in the Amazon box.That turned out to be A-OK.  Yes, it did.The pan is functional.  It cooks things.  Sometimes I use the pan to cook eggs.  I eat turkey bacon almost every morning.  And this pan sure knows how to help with that.  Thank you pan.  Someone started calling it “The Grey(s) Pan” because they enjoy believing there are aliens in outer space.  And this pan is grey with white acne colored speckles, so maybe the “The Grey(s) Pan” is going through puberty.  It would make sense, hanging out on my oven all day I guess.  I don’t judge.I have also cooked ground beef for tacos in “The Grey(s) Pan,” as well as various delectable chicken dishes.I will keep you appraised as to whether “The Grey(s) Pan” has anything to say for it/his/her/them(s) self.Thank you “The Grey(s) Pan” – you’re the best!

  I virtually never write reviews of items I've bought, but this little psingle an is so great that I feel compelled to give it a shout out.  It is the perfect size for making an individual omelet, scrambled eggs or other portion.  The nonstick surface is so pronounced that it only takes a slight spray of oil and that same surface makes it a breeze to clean.  Your food will slide right off the pan like on demos on television, but this is real!  It's small and attractive enough to sit out on the top of the stove if you are lacking in storage space.  Cooking is even on the small cooking surface.  Truly a great little pan.

  This is a great little frying pan and has been good for scrambled and fried eggs.  We were looking for an alternative to our all-clad set because the small frying pan in that set doesn’t cleanup well with eggs.  This little pan does the job by cooking quickly and evenly, then is a breeze to cleanup.  The inside of the pan feels slightly abrasive but that hasn’t impacted how the eggs release from the pan or cleanup.  It is also cheap enough where longevity isn’t a huge concern because it can be easily replaced if needed.

  Will update this over time.1 week in: For the most part I like them. They seem well made and are definitely easy to clean. Another reviewer mentioned the inside discolored and I kept an eye out for that. Based off their picture I've determined it was burned oil. I was able to wash mine off with soap. I do see a problem with the handles discoloring due to the heat of my gas stove. I've attempted to keep the handle away from the stove as much as possible but one discolored the first day and there's nothing I can do about it. I do like the ease of washing off anything stuck on. I've only dealt with breakfast stuff so far so I haven't seen how it will hold up with meats. It takes a while to figure out the best way to cook eggs to keep it from sticking. For my stove it needs to be med-low flame. Any higher it sticks any lower it doesn't cook evenly and falls apart when I try to flip. It took approximately 4-5 attempts to get it right. Most of the time the egg hasn't stuck but even when it stuck pretty bad it just required a little extra work to clean it. I do worry about the possibility of chipping the inside. My largest skillet arrived with a ding already. Since the bottom of these skillets have a metal area that isn't flush to the skillet you have to be very careful if you have to store these inside each other. I've used a silicone mat to protect them but would have loved if I didn't have to do this. My only big con and this is more of with the non stick industry in general I spent a lot of time trying to find skillets that were safe and didn't use any chemicals in their non stick properties. I thought this did but I'm not super sure as other people have stated it does still use chemical coating. I was hopeful that by going with the Stone style cookware that chemicals could be avoided but after many hours looking into all the top brands who say they don't use chemicals I found various would admit they do. I don't know if that is the case with this brand but I hope it's safe.Overall my pros outweigh my consPro:Is non stickEasy to cleanHeats up much faster so flame can be lowerReally prettylightweightCons:Handle discolors really easy when near heatInside seems like it might chip easilyCannot easily be stacked inside each otherThere is a slight pooling that happens around the center, wish they were completely flat.

  I started off buying two skillets just to see how they performed. Within a month, I started ordering other pieces to replace all of our stovetop cookware.  It distributes heat better than any other nonstick or stainless pan I have ever used.  Super easy to clean and we have had nothing stick.  We have cooked fried eggs, omelets, salmon, pancakes and a variety of other things and literally, nothing sticks.  It's also heavier than most non-stick pans, which I think will make it even more durable. I have used it from low heat to medium high (high heat for a few minutes) and it performs well for all. Over the years I have had stainless, cast iron, ceramic and many other, some high end, sets but this is what both my husband and I reach for now no matter what we cook.

  This is a terrific pan needs only minimal drops of oil. Cleans easy nothing sticks. 3 suggestions: 1) don’t let oil sit in pan over night. All pans get a sticky residue that won’t come off if you leave oil sit in pans. 2) don’t put in dishwasher pans last longer if gently washed by hand. 3) not for high heat, pan will discolor and get a yellowish goldish tone from high heat that will not come off.Excellent pan with care cooks evenly and very well one of my favorite pans.

  The touted Non-Stick coating didn't last more than a few weeks.  The frying arrived without any  protective packing, product sleeve or brand advertisements - including cleaning instructions for protecting the advertised 'special' non-stick surface; which vanished after several weeks of use.  What you end up with is a well-made frying pan that requires soaking after each use to remove cooking oil, butter or fried food particles firmly stuck to the surface as if it were Super Glue.  Recommend purchasing another brand that actually has a non-stick surface.

  Pan was purchased less than 1/2 year ago and one day the entire non-stick coating stopped working properly. I started noting black char marks and food started sticking. I reached out to customer support, they asked for my invoice and told me ""Thanks for your response. We well received the item picture and order details and refer this inquiry to our colleague who is handling the Amazon US orders to reply to you.""Been 2 weeks since this correspondence, I have followed up twice to check on the status and have not received any response.I genuinely wanted to reuse this pan because during first few months it was hands down the best budget non-stick pan on Amazon; however, until the looming question is resolved one can only speculate what went wrong: if the pan was from a faulty batch or if this is expected wear and tear with this pan if heavily used.

  I was skeptical of the cheap price. I bought this and their saucepan. I was reluctant to buy new pans because my other one from a different brand didn't last long. The reviews were amazing so I gave it a shot. It is almost impossible to stick anything to these pans which is weird because they have a rough texture you would think anything would stick to. Would definitely buy in the future, but I may never have to. I can't say I recommend these in the over due to the silicone handles. The manufacturer said up to 350 degrees, but mine discolored after my first oven usage. Not a deal breaker for me.

  So I was getting tired of scraping pans after frying eggs, so I tried this one.  I read the reviews and glad I did, the coating is rough which defies logic as to why the eggs slide out so easily.  Highly recommended... I'm buying every size!

  This pan was great for about a year but the non-stick coating wore down very quickly after that. We never touched it with metal, only the soft side of the sponge. It's basically unusable now after 14 months. for that reason I would not recommend.

    Solid Cookware - Not Compatible with Duxtop Induction
  
",3.0,Cory Scherer,"Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased this pan with the Duxtop Induction cooktop, and I was quite disappointed to find out the pan did not work with the device.  I specifically chose this pan because of the description touting that it was induction capable.  As I only have the one device to try the induction compatibility on, that is the basis for the reduction in the rating.With that being said, in order to give a fair judgment of the product, I decided to use it on my coil electrical burner and my glass cooktop.  The pan performed well in my tests.  I cooked some fajita steak and an egg and neither item stuck to the pan.  It was easy to clean and has proven durable in its first two days of use.The results of the pan performance leave me upset that it will not work for the intention it was purchased, but I will keep the pan for other cooking appliances.

  Beautiful and a great price.When you find an attractive pan, there are always special rules. This one says don’t over heat. That can be confusing for a pan, but it is better than “don’t use vegetable oil.” I usually cook with margarine or oil in the bottom anyway. I would imagine it is just because whatever oil you line it with, it will burn if left without food in it.This is so attractive with the wood grain handle and the very solid coating, i don’t mind making sure to put a bit of oil in the bottom every so often after washing.

  Let me start by saying that if you want to make an omelette, forget it with this pan. Eggs aren't great either. I bought this pan specifically to replace my favorite teflon pan that I used to make omelettes. It is not even remotely in the same non-stick league as a good teflon pan. The sides are too steep to be conducive for easily flipping things either. The reviews were wrong in my case, in that regard this pan is a total fail. BUT, it's a great saute pan for random cooking, veggies etc. I like it, and I'll keep it, but still looking for another pan...

The thing that’s really great about this pan is it does not have a coating on it. All my Teflon pans eventually start shedding little particles of Teflon into the food which is very scary.

    GREAT COOKWARE - GREAT PRICE - GREAT VALUE

  Shopping for skillets is a lot like shopping for pain relief. There are waaaay too many to find the type you need, and the only way to know is to get it home & try it.I had some very specific things I looked for. This little skillet met them all...Affordability: I can’t remember how many cheap skillets I’ve bought & tossed because it’s a crapshoot every time. I’m always the loser. I won’t even look at “Celebrity Name Cookware”. Or anything else I’d need a bank loan for. This skillet is on the low side of the middle.Cooking Area: Skillets are measured by the top open area. This is not at all important. What IS important is the bottom flat surface area - the actual cooking surface. Most skillets are 3” - 4” less than what they say it is. Your 12” pan has an 8” surface. This skillet has high, straight walls & 6” surface.Durability: I am never going to drive a truck over my skillet. I’m also not going to beat it with a hammer. So I’m not sure what’s  the point of telling me this info. It FEELS well made. Nothing loose. Nothing flimsy. That’s all I care about.Non Stick - Without Extra Effort By Me: I’m never going to place a bag of wrapped candy in my pan. I’m never going to burn cheese in it, either. Why would I? This skillet has a nice, “stoned” surface that I seasoned before first use. So far, everything still slides around like it should. That’s what I’m looking for. A skillet to cook food in. Not a science projectI love this 8” pan so much that I ordered the 12” one. I think these skillets will be the last ones  I’ll ever need.  This is  “Must Have” cookware!
