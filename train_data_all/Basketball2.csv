  In fact, the picture of this ball contains a small mistake.The word ""INFUSION"" is not printed on the ball at all,and actually the 2nd picture which contains ""NBA Zi/O"" is the correct one.Note that there are 4 levels for this type of Spaling basketballs:1.) Professional Game Ball: The official game ball of NBA.2.) Maximum Performance: Ultimate composite leather cover for the highly competitive player.3.) Advanced Performance: Premium composite leather cover for the serious player.4.) Performance: Durable outdoor cover for players of all levels.and this item belongs to the ""Maximum Performance"".I bought a ball which belongs to ""Advanced Performance"" level at the Dick's,and it was the same price as this one, which is a better and higher quality ball.Thus, I returned my ball to the Dick's and ordered this one.In addition,this ball is more suitable for indoor play.If you use it as an outdoor basketball,you will need a new one soon.

  I needed a new ball to play with at the park and I saw that the reviews on this product was promising. Not a lot of people reviewed the ball being used for outside play, so I thought I had to share. After maybe around a month and a half of running 5’s and other pick up games at the park, I noticed that the outer layer of the ball started to peel off. The durability of the ball drops a butt ton If you use it outside but i am sure it will last longer inside.

  This ball helped me in so many ways I never thought it would. Not only was I a better baller after using this NBA certified product, but I have been able to limit voicing my political views to others and have not looked back.  This basketball gives me the feeling of greats, (that should never voice their political opinions) like Jordan, James, and Magic. Every time I dribble this unique sphere, all I can think about is the hardwood court, the roaring fans, and nothing else not having anything to do with sports. The best part of this whole thing is that I can play both inside and OUTSIDE with this ball, so I never have to worry about thinking of anything else but dribbling a basketball. This ball is the perfect product/gift, especially if you're the kind of person that doesn't like to share political views or know someone like that. I recommend this product for everyone including all those short-sighted newscasters!

  This ball has o warpage and bounces straight up off the dribble.  Many budget balls are slightly warped and do no bounce straight up.  Spins well on the fingers and shoots well.... no unexplainable misses.Only issue is that the labels and lettering are oily?!?  Any modern basketball should be tacky, not oily.  Had to wash the ball three times with soap and water to remove the oil from the lettering.Obviously this ball is not worthy of being selected as an ""Amazon's Choice"".  And even more obvious is that no one at Amazon has EVER played basketball.

    Spalding Zi/O is very underrated - you can't go wrong with this one
  
",4.0,AT,"Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2013","









  
  
    
  First of all, I must say that I'm a ""repeat buyer"" of this basketball. I play outdoors 3-4 times a week, and my basketball is always picked as a game ball among others. It feels, bounces, and weighs very good. Breaking in period is not that long either, until then it is pretty slippery though. I usually need to replace my basketball in every few months, but it's totally worth it for under $30. Every serious basketball player knows that, the ball is the most important element, and you can't compromise on it. I've tried several other Spalding balls, including very expensive ones. Shelf life is pretty much same with all, therefore I've started to buy this one 4-5 years ago. After 6-7 of them, I still come back and buy this one. Amazon is the only retailer who sells this, no other major sporting goods store have it, instead they have overpriced other models, I'm not sure why. Or you can get a beginners ball at this price. Couple of times ball didn't arrive exactly round, bouncing and rotating slightly off, but Amazon was very helpful to replace it free of charge. I'm just about to order a new one, and I thought I'd share my thoughts on this Spalding Zi/O Basketball.

  On the outside, everything looks great. The ball seems sturdy and pumped well. But as soon as I bounced it on the indoor court, there was virtually no bounce. After pumping it until I could barely put more air in, it was playable but lacked good bounce. Now I have used this ball around 10 times and even when the ball is pumped until it cannot be pumped anymore, a regular dribble will only bring the ball up just above my knees. Very disappointed.

  I have used this ball over past few years buying new ones as they wear on the outdoor court and noticed a trend of degrading quality, with my latest purchase feeling like a kids plastic ball. Item arrived in a box with no official packaging by the way, not that I mind that much.Grip is non existent when it picks up a little dust from the outdoor court, and the surface is very hard and uncomfortable. The bounce lost its ""heft"" and I feel ripped off for paying over 30 dollars for it. I suspect this will be the unfortunate circumstance for most import goods in the future: they do not want to increase price too much so they cut corners in materials. Very disappointed, Spalding.

  My basketball arrived in a nondescript square box without any additional packaging, which I'm happy about for environmental reasons.  The ball had a great, slightly tacky feel at first, but as others have commented, the surface is a dust magnet when used outdoors.  You feel the difference immediately with every bounce outside, but it hasn't gotten to a point where it feels slippery because of the dust.Where I have issue with the ball is that it just doesn't hold air for very long.  I had to pump up the ball when it first arrived, but I expected I would need to add some anyway.  However, it lost significant pressure after about a week to the point where I couldn't even dribble it because it's too flat.  After pumping the ball up, it went flat again by the time I used it the next week.  I've been playing basketball for decades and have never had a ball lose so much air in such a short period of time.

  So I recently heard of a new sport which involves tossing a rubberized ball into a hoop/net combination.  While I don't think this sport will ever take off quite like tennis, I do think it's a great opportunity for affluent suburban young people to socialize and get in some good cardio at their local private athletic club or in their private gated cul-de-sac.I understand you can purchase a ""Hoop"" and have it professionally installed at your estate by professional contractors.  This is the way to go.  If you haven't yet tried ""basket-balls"", you are missing out!

On arrival day (Wednesday, Sept. 16, 2020), I pumped it to 8 lbs and initially it looked OK. My son was excited to try his new ball, so after a week of sitting at his quarantine computer for school work, we planned to shoot baskets on Saturday afternoon. Unfortunately, the ball was already flat. I pumped it up again Saturday night and it was already flat by Sunday morning. Shame on the seller and Amazon for selling defective products like this. I've bought dozens of basketballs in my life and this is the first time this ever happened. Very disappointing for me and especially my son!

    Not Really an Outdoor Ball
  
",2.0,reality,"Reviewed in the United States April 29, 2011","









  
  
    
  The exterior of the new spalding balls get roughed up quickly when used on an outdoor court.I had an older Zi/O from the late 90s and used it fairly often... until buying two new balls this year (spalding zi/o and a spalding tacksoft). The Zi/o ball has panels that are starting to peel slightly (not peeling severely but the black underneath the orange panels is visible on two panels) after about 8 months of rare use. And the tacksoft looks like I've been playing with it for multiple years, after about 2 months of heavy use.Both the Zi/O and the Tacksoft seem like good bargains for INDOOR balls and have great grips, but they aren't made for outdoor use cause the grip wears quickly on both balls. Spalding needs to step its game up.

",3.0,Tuf-Gong,"Reviewed in the United States August 5, 2010","









  
  
    
  I just bought the Zi/o in a brick and mortar store. I didn't buy from amazon because there are two different balls pictured on this page, and I didn't want to end up receiving the wrong ball from amazon. If you look at the two pictures on top of this page, one has a ball with 'INFUSION' on it, while the other shows a ball with Zi/o on it.Amazon should clear this ambiguity, so customers know exactly which ball they're ordering. It's already hard enough to decide between different brands and models of basketballs. We don't need amazon making things even trickier by showing pictures of different balls under the same name.

  Had it for about 2 years, and lately the leather cover is peeling off and doesn't hold air like it used to when new. Majority of use was indoors, so I know I haven't been rough with it. I don't know that the average life span of a basketball should be, but I'd consider paying a little more and getting one of better quality.

  I'm a pretty avid basketball player.  I rarely play outdoors.  But, I just moved to another so I had to look for some local games at the park.  I decided to get my own outdoor ball so I can warm up before I fail at giving a solid impression!  But, this ball just doesn't seem to bounce right--either it doesn't seem to hold the air, or it bounces like a lopsided ball.  Without telling my friends, he mentioned this to me.  Buy at your own risk.  If I were you, I would just go to a sports store and try it out.  I went to a Sports Authority nearby to test out the other out door balls and they work much better.  And, they're just as cheap.  Surprising...sometimes Amazon isn't the cheapest.

  Pros:- Very high quality composite leather- Great feel on the fingertips as the ball is released from the hand- Keeps form well. After months of use, the ball still doesn't need to be inflatedCons:- None that I can think off.So if you need a  new basketball, I recommend this one.

    First 1 Star Review EVER here! BAD BALL
  
",1.0,Eric Wetzel,"Reviewed in the United States August 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  Basketballs, structurally, have few absolute requirements. The primary function of that structure is to secure air so that the ball can be used. The ball arrived, I excitedly pulled it from the packaging and pumped it up. It worked great - for that initial 10 minute shoot around. The next day, it was flat. I pumped it up again. It worked fine again, until it sat overnight. It simply won’t hold air like it’s supposed to. I’m extremely disappointed, and since I excitedly destroyed the packaging and threw it away, I can’t send it back. This was a complete waste of money - who wants a ball that needs pumped up every time you want to use it? A basketball that can’t hold air is worthless to me. I rarely issue bad reviews, but this one merits it.

  I wanted a moderately priced ball to play outdoors at a nearby park during a brief 10 week stint in NYC so I scoured Amazon and was able to purchase this item for around $22.xx.  To my surprise, the ball could actually work better as an indoor ball.  It's no Wilson Evolution, but it is closer to a TF-1000 than one might imagine.I used it outdoors a few times and given that the court was a bit dirty, the ball caught a coat of dust and became a bit slippery at times.  I'm looking forward to playing indoors again where I think the ball will excel.For the price and the quality of the ball, I definitely think this is a great purchase.

  Had this ball for a solid eight years now. Pretty close to a game replica ball on an indoor court, but has the durability for outdoors. I've put it pretty seriously through its paces outdoors, and while it held up for a couple years, it did eventually wear down.Overall, I would say this ball is a great pick if you want a great indoor ball that you can occasionally take outdoors, but I would go for something with more rubber in it if I played outdoors every day. The Zi/O is about as good as you can ask for in terms of outdoor durability from a leather ball, but the simple fact is that a leather ball will never be invincible outside.

    For me, the worst basketball in the $30 range
  
",1.0,Edward W.,"Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2018","









  
  
    
  These Zi/O's have been the worst basketballs I've purchased over the past few years. At one time, they were decent. The last 4 out of 5 that I purchased at Big 5, the balls had that weird dead feeling bounce at proper inflation and when you fill it with a little more air, it doesn't bounce straight up; it goes a tiny bit off. Been playing bball for over 40 years so you can feel it when there's something wrong with it. Several of them also lost a tiny bit of air so you have to always pump it up a little bit, even after a few days. I've switched to other Spalding models or to the Wilson Jet Pro and avoid the Zi/O's like the plague.

  The initial red flag was the ball came without any sort of original packaging: just a basketball in a cardboard box. The ball came deflated, but was hard as a rock and would not bounce. I didn't even bother with it, returned it and will be looking for a different ball. The customer review that says this is ""the GOAT"" of outdoor basketballs is laughable.

  Bought as a replacement for my old indoor/outdoor ball which had become pretty worn down and lost most of its grip--or so I thought...until I got this one. Initially I thought that it just needed to be broken in a little but after a month of daily play I can say that this ball just doesn't want to grip. There is something just sort of...off about it--the material it's made out of, the way it bounces, etc. Similar to other negative reviews on here, mine is consistently in need of air and by now I've pretty much relegated this one to my trunk and gone back to old faithful.

  I bought 2 of these balls for a summer program.  Basketball was one of a host of activities we do with our middle school students so use was maybe only 3 hours a week tops. 2 weeks in I notice staff was pumping up one of the new balls and thought little of it although I personally inflated the balls upon delivery.  4 weeks in I reached for the ball and was surprised that it was so flat it would not bounce. There did not appear to be anything wrong with the valve.  I pumped it up and kept it in my office for the week to see if there was a change in air pressure.  At the end of the week the ball was dead and would only bounce a few inches from the floor with effort.  Logged on to Amazon to initiate return only to find that i was not outside of the return window of time.Big waste & disappointment for a cash strapped non-profit academic program.

  Well... for the price, you really can't beat it.It's well-made and will probably last a fairly long time (especially indoors). My only complaint is that it feels slightly heavier than other balls on the court. It's definitely the ""official"" NBA size... but I'm a bit skeptical about it being the proper weight. Either way, I'm happy with the purchase. It feels great in my hands and is much better than just about any ball at a comparable price.Overall, I'd say it's a good buy.-AJ

  My son thought he lost this ball a few days ago. He was so upset. He said it was the best ball he’s ever had. He’s had it since Christmas and said it had been his favorite basketball (he’s had many!) because it hadn’t lost any of its grip yet which impressed him compared to other balls. Luckily we found the ball and he has it back but I will definitely purchase this again when the time comes. I trust my basketball loving son’s opinion.

  If you play outdoor basketball this is THE ball you need to have. Real leather balls are really expensive and probably not the best to be playing on concrete. The cheaper balls have that horrible plastic feel to them. They also last a good amount of time. I've been buying this style for years and really I wouldn't play with anything else.

My friends and I would dribble the ball straight down and it would go off to a completely different direction coming back up like it was lopsided which wasn’t the case. Ordered a second one and had the same issue... The quality of the black lines along the ball is horrible. The lines aren’t flush and are poorly made. I believe they are the culprit of the bad bounce. Would not recommend.

    Disappointing Basketball

  I have always been a fan of Spalding basketballs, especially in synthetic leather. I bought my first one about 25yrs. ago, so I was really disappointed with the quality of this ball. It has a great feel out of the box, and plays well especially outdoors. Unfortunately, in 4 months the outer cover started to crumble. This ball would have lasted longer if it was made out of rubber! That's a sad commentary. Hopefully it was a ""bad"" one?

  This ball is inferior to an outdoor dedicated ball because it wears out very quickly.It is a poor indoor ball because it is too hard, does not break in well, and is very slippery when hands get sweaty.By attempting to do both, it does nether well. However, as far as indoor/outdoor balls go, this is one of the better ones (compared to the other Spalding models and it is superior to any of the indoor/outdoor Wilson models)

   A great basketball with soft and squishy feeling. It has a nice texture color (black,gold). Not real leather composite. It can be used outside but, rough surface can damage the ball instantly. Dust can stick on it very easily and the ball isn’t that grippy so suggest to put little bit of water in your hand and dry a little bit to get a better grip. Nice color , good looking, ok bouncing. Good feeling when shooting. It is a really nice ball and giving 4 stars because of how they deliver the ball and negative parts of it.

  Summary: STAY AWAY, LOOK ELSEWHERE.When I first got this ball, I was extremely excited about it but I was VERY mistaken. The ball has always bounced hard and never broke in but instead (as seen in pic 2) completely lost the ""leather"" and grip. The ball has picked up dust from the first dribble and has always been slippery (even if I cleaned it). Everyone on the court disliked the ball and I definitely wouldn't recommend it. Look for another one.

  We've been playing regularly in our dead-end with a small group since COVID and this ball has held up and was great out of the box.  It's not as soft as some of the other balls but it feels more durable and hasn't lost much grip in the month of use we've had it for so far!

  Beautiful ball in color and feel, but the air input/nipple is clearly raised a full 1/8"" around the needle input, this is a disaster for reliable dribbling. I am convinced the online marketplace are seconds and rejects, would be easy to see and feel this raised area in a physical retail store; and likely rejected by the retail mgr to avoid returns.

  I had initially bought an indoor ball, but didn't want to ruin it by mainly playing out side. I purchased this ball for the reason to play outdoors. It's been more than a month and I've been using it twice a week.. The texture doesn't feel too cheap, rubbery or plastic-y. The channels are great for grip and clutch shooting. The weight feels okay.The only con is that on certain dusty outdoor courts it will make the ball slippery.  Overall I'd say this is a great ball to practice and play pick up games with.

  This is a great ball, I've had four or five in the last years and it's good for playing indoor and outdoor. It feels great and has a very good grip. I use it on pavement allmost every weekend through the year and it last about one or one and a half year. Great value for the money. Don't let it stay wet, dry it out quickly and clean it up from dirty water or mud, or the ""skin"" will start to lift-off.

  I have purchased this ball before, a few years ago. And have tried several different ones throughout the years. This ball used to be a good top of the line outdoor ball. From day one the panels started coming up at the seams, I tried to ignore it for the most part. Also has a fake feel to the skin itself, channels are not too deep, and the grip itself gets slippery pretty easy. I have played for about 20 years, and have a pretty good feel for the game, primarily run PG and SG on the court so the feel of the ball is important to me as it is for many other players. I did not attempt to return this ball, I put a blade in it to end the misery, and so noone else would have to use such a crap ball.Should note that the previous ball I purchased was great, it lasted a long time and had a good feel. It's possible this one was a bad batch, but seemed to be doomed either way.

  This is a good basketball so far as durability goes.  Because it is an outdoor/indoor ball however, it does have that synthetic leather feel to it.  If your looking for a solely indoor ball with authentic soft leather, I recommend you look somewhere else. If you just want something to shoot around with and a casual basis and want something that will last a long time, look no further.

  Have had this basketball for quite a few months now, and love it. Feels good in hands, good grip, and very durable. I play both indoors and outdoors, and the ball plays well on both courts. Of course it is much better suited for indoor use, but what basketball isn't. If you primarily play outside, this is a good choice due to price, and quality of the synthetic leather used. In all the months I've been playing, it's still looking almost brand new, where as other balls I've used in the past quickly took on tears. This is a good pick for both types of play, outside or in, and certainly a good deal for the price. I would recommend this ball for it's quality, price, and how it plays well on any type of surface. Unless you primarily play indoors, in which you should consider a full leather basketball, this is the best deal.

The reason for the 3 stars is because the ball collects a lot of dirt and it transfers to your hands. Also, the black strips on the ball feels a little sticky. I hope the sticky feel goes away after playing more with the ball. I'm still not happy with the fact that my hands are full of dirt after playing and I mean black dirty palm hands.

  Based on the reviews outside of Amazon and some of the ones here, this was supposed to be the best outdoor basketball. I go to the courts early in the morning to shoot around for exercise and I use the ball weekly for about a hour. In two months, it has lost a lot of its grip, I constantly have to wash the ball because it sticks to all dirt and dust. It's also heavier when compared to other basketballs I've tried. If you're a serious baller, I would look elsewhere. This Summer, I'll try another ball out in hopes it performs better than this one.

  I haven't played basketball in a while but came across a random ball while moving and it sparked the desire to play again. Turns put the ball was busted so I went online to Amazon in search of a new one and decided on this gem. Feels great in my hands but I felt like it could use a bit more bounce as I had to hit the pavement pretty hard for it to respond with the quickness I desired. After adding air, I must say that I am ready to hit the courts for a one on one game of hoops! Oh wait, its covid season. Oh well, looks like I'm going to be spending a lot of time perfecting my jump shot for now at least!

  Spalding has a few different Zi/O balls for outdoor use.  I bought this Zi/O, the Zi/O Excel and the Under Armor 495.  The Spalding Excel Zi/o is far and away the best ball and keeps its grip (5 stars).  The standard Zi/O has no more grip after 2 weeks play but a smooth surface which is fine if you like that.  the Under Armour 495 seems too heavy in general but kept its grip.  If you are looking at Spalding make sure you are getting the EXCEL Zi/O.

  This is a classic and Spalding still makes two of the best all purpose balls. The funny thing is depending on personal preference, you might like their replica game ball instead. Either is a dependable choice.The one thing I will say is that while you can play outdoors here and there with this, it's not great if you play all the time. It will last a decent amount of time, but the real problem is the composite leather. It by nature picks up more dirt and dust from the courts than other materials. Definitely bring a towel to keep wiping this off.So to recap: great all purpose ball with durability at a great price point. But material composition means that other brands that have rubber leather hybrids will be better choices if you tend to play more on outdoor courts than indoor courts.  If you play more on indoor courts and occasionally at the park, then this should be your everyday ball (or the other Spalding ball depending of feel/preference)

    Difference between Zi/O and Zi/O EXCEL
  
",5.0,Chris,"Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2012","









  
  
    
  I don't know what's the relationship between Zi/O and Zi/O EXCEL, but there is only information for Zi/O EXCEL on Spalding website, so I guess Zi/O EXCEL is the successor of Zi/O.Previously I had a Zi/O EXCEL, bought from Amazon about a year ago. It was good, but unfortunately was stolen some days ago.So I decided to buy another ball, a nicer ball. First I thought the Zi/O would be better than Zi/O EXCEL cause the price was higher which was $29.99. But the second day after I placed my order, the Zi/O price went down as same as Zi/O EXCEL which is $20.8. That sucks. Then I didn't know which one is better.After I received it, have it in my hand now. I can tell that the feeling of Zi/O is more smoother and softer than Zi/O EXCEL. And the color is lighter, more orange like rather than red and brown appearing of Zi/O EXCEL. The grip is good too, I can grab it easily by single hand which is only 7 inches long. Haven't tried it on the court yet.So far I like the feeling of Zi/O more than Zi/O EXCEL, and it is a good deal now with the same price as Zi/O EXCEL.

  Received product that was NOT regulation size. Its a fluke, no big deal, guy in warehouse grabbed the wrong ball.Received replacement. The SAME undersized ball arrives which is NOT regulation NBA size. Description of item is blatant lie.At least the look of the ball matches the photo. That's about it.

  Received on time. I also bought a new net and the pump kit. This ball has great grip feel works well on smooth or rough pavement. I would recommend this product. I made a great decision based on reviews.

  The ball is pretty good quality and has a good bounce.  For an indoor ball this would be pretty good, but outdoors it tends to pick up a lot of dust/dirt, which makes it very slippery.  It's alright for a few minutes, but as soon as it gets dirty it starts to lose grip.  I bought this with the intention of mostly using it outdoors, where it's almost always going to be getting some dust and dirt on it, so it's not ideal.If you're just shooting around by yourself you can still grip it alright, but trying to make any quick movements with it can be difficult.  It's not like it constantly goes flying out of your hands, but it's definitely noticeable and not a good game-ball on some courts.

  First ball arrived flat and could not hold any air in. See photos. I explained Amazon UK this was a Christmas gift for a friend. They arranged for a new delivery in 72 hours. Massive thumb up for the 5 star reliability.This ball is very good. The composite leather surface is soft and simulates the leather feel in terms of grip. Most of the grip comes from the black stripes grooves, just as the official ball. This is by far the best ball for your bank !

  Bought this on recommended reviewsI needed a second ball to replace my Nike Elite TournamentPros:- Ball is generally well made and has a weighty feel- Grip is good - actually very niceCons-  Ball deflated after first day - So need to inflate again (never had this problem with my Nike)- Bounce is not as good as I would expect - but I guess I will get used to it- I am not so sure of the rubbery feel when playingIt feels like it would take some time to break into the ballFor the price - not a bad buy

  This is an outstanding ball. It's a fairly expensive ball but well worth the price. The ball is very light making it amazing for 3 pointers and difficult layups. It has slightly less bounce than a rubber ball which is expected but it feels far more like a professional ball. The grip is great and even with small hands like I have I can palm it easily which I can rarely do with other basketballs. The only bad thing I've noticed is it marks quite easily especially if you're rough with it. Overall it's the best ball I've come across so far and the best ball for it's price range.

  It gets 3 stars for value for money. It's a ball so it's painful spending over 30quid for it. Saying that it's exactly what my partner wanted and it was a gift. He loves it and it seems really durable

  Just start playing with the ball. Sounds great to me. Not a good grip as Wilson balls. But I believe in this ball because it has improved my dribbling skills since I started using it from days ago. I recommend everyone if you play outdoors just keep this ball in your repository. It will help you :)
