    Magical book for children
  
",5.0,I. R. Borgos,"Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2017","









  
  
    
  I wasn't going to buy this book for my child, assuming it was just another story for children that was popularized for no reason.  However, my otherwise boisterous toddler proved that this book was worth it's weight in gold.  From the first reading, she sat perfectly still, absorbing every word and picture of the book, and was completely fascinated from beginning to end.  So much so, that she insists on me reading it over and over before bedtime, every night now.  She seems to find something magic in the story that maybe only children can see.  Indeed, this is a very special book.  She particularly loves the mouse and the old lady whispering hush.  I can't recommend this book enough.  It is really amazing the effect it has had on my child!!!

  This book is a classic, so you really can't go wrong giving it as a gift to a new grandma. Sturdy board book, nice medium size, and decent price.I'm not a fake profile, nor have I been compensated for any reviews...in fact, the reason I take the time to review purchases when I can is due to the fact that I find other honest reviews helpful and am tired of all the fake reviews that have polluted this site. If you find my review helpful, please take the time to rate it as such, not because I'll get anything out of it but so that others can see true reviews. Thanks and Happy Shopping!

  Read this to my children, gave as gifts to my grandchildren and just purchased it again for my great grandson. This is perfect for a little person who is too young for most childrens’ books. I like the way the pictures become darker as bedtime approaches. The board book can be touched by my five month old without it being harmed. I also like the fact that the central character is is bunny and culturally natural. Two of my great grandsons are mostly Scandinavian but the youngest little guy is half Hispanic/Dominican and all children can identify with a bunny.

  I understand that this is THE book for children.  I don't remember it - I don't think it was around when I needed it.  But I've been told that it's ideal for reading slowly and quietly to children at bedtime, to quiet them down for sleep.  Yes, I've seen the screeds that dissect the illustrations, but forget all that.  This comes in various formats - I've often given the board book version for newborns.This book is part of the library of classic children's books I give as a welcoming gift for new babies, all wrapped up in a hand-crocheted blankie.  Every parent has thanked me for it.  So I guess it works.

",5.0,MommyX8,"Reviewed in the United States November 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  This is such a classic story what is not to love. I am trying to get a routine set with my 8 week old son, consisting of bath, breast/bottle, book and bed. I picked this book because of the simple repetitive story line, the bright colors and the black and white contrasting colors. At this young age, babies love to look at patterns, and contrast. They also love to listen to the sound of your voice. This book does great at both of those aspects. And I like that it is a hard board book so as he gets bigger I don’t have to worry about pages being ripped.

    Really kinda small and “vintage” print quality not doing it for me (board book)
  
",3.0,HW,"Reviewed in the United States June 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  I should have paid more attention to the dimensions. Yes board books are meant for babies and toddlers but it’s so small it feels a bit pricey. I should have bought a different edition. Also board quality is quite thin compared to other board books (but it does have a lot of pages...) and print quality- I think it’s meant to look more like the vintage print but I guess I’m used to modern sharpness and saturation so it leaves me feeling a little underwhelmed.We got this to read along with our “good night lab” parody board book (which our 1.5 yr old LOVES - something about grumpy old professors shouting “publish” gets peels if giggles every time) We’ll see whether the kiddo likes the original one as much...but if not it might have more to do with format or lack of grumpy professors

    Best Book to Read to Little Ones Before Bed!
  
",5.0,Beth,"Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2018","









  
  
    
  I LOVE THIS BOOK! I grew up reading it but didnt realize how much I loved it until I had my own baby. We read this every night before bed and she is just a small baby but she is definitely reading along, looks forward to it, touches the pictures, and it is just a great book! She is only 7 months but as she gets older I know she will love it even more when she can read it herself. The illustrations are great, the words are fun and I just love it. The board book is a great size too!

  My toddler LOVES goodnight moon and wants to read it to us. However, my toddler has already destroyed one paperback copy of Goodnight Moon so I bought the board book. This book has withstood a LOT of abuse including being slept on, thrown out of a crib, pages bent all the way back, and chewed on. This was a book I loved as a child, so I'm happy to see my toddler enjoy and love this story as well. We read it every night before bed. Highly recommend!

    One of the greatest children’s books of all time
  
",5.0,Sarah,"Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  I don’t ever write reviews on Amazon,  but after reading this book 1000 times to my son I am convinced it is one of the greatest children’s books of all time. It is hypnotic and calming in a way no other book can achieve. The simple rhymes and phrases are written so children can understand them AND quickly and easily pick up on them to start repeating. In fact, they were written in the way children talk which is maybe why the book is so engaging for kids. (The author actually studied this during her life!)My favorite piece though is the illustrations. It took me maybe 100 times in to realize the detail of the illustrations and how they change as the book goes on. The room gets darker, the moon rises, the mouse scatters across the floor, the time on the clock gradually increases and there’s even a few hidden Easter eggs in there too! A copy of goodnight moon on the nightstand and runaway bunny (Browns other bestseller) on the bookshelf. (One of the paintings too is a picture from runaway bunny!) this book has become a favorite and crucial part of our bedtime routine and, in my opinion, is a must have for every house!

",5.0,Kimberly,"Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  Ended up having to purchase this again after we lost it (how toddlers lose things In random places is beyond me). My son was asking every night for his “Goodnight Moon” book. Seriously though, this book has been great through developmental stages. At different ages different pages and parts of the book fascinated him. At one point the mouse, another the red balloon, etc. Now he is at the age where he asks me to point out the objects and talks about them. It’s also great to incorporate into a ritual of saying goodnight to various toys, people, and objects.

But as soon as we read it, he knows it time for bed and he'll fall asleep.We have one copy we received as a baby shower gift, but I bought this one for $5 to keep in the suitcase for when we travel, so we don't forget ours.I'm most likely going to be ordering the lap edition soon.

  A timeless classic, I gave as a gift, but have many years of experience with my youngest. The details in the pictures allow for many variations of story time.

  Repeating, rhythmic, pleasant sounding text. My husband and I both yawn now as soon as we start reading this! (Conditioning much? ;) ) We LOVE this book. I love that the pages alternate between black and white (grayscale, not high contrast), and full color; I like that the colors are bold, which is developmentally appropriate for newborn eyes. We read this to our daughter from the day she came home from the hospital, she loved it then, and she still loves it. (Though she did go through a phase of a couple of months where she fought bedtime and thus hated this book. Only lasted about two months, from 6 months to 8 months. She is 10 months old now and chooses it for us to read to her at bedtime). Also, I study early childhood education (birth-age 8) and my literacy professor highly recommended this book for reading from newborn onward.

  Publisher's SummaryA little rabbit is lulled to sleep surrounded by all that he knows and loves best in the great green room of his house.*********************I don't think it's really complicated why this is popular. The story is not exactly mind-blowing or wonderfully heartfelt.  HOWEVER, this has a lot of repetition of a lot of big words for a baby and it's done in a way that (yes, it can be boring to some) when read prior to bedtime can set a tone for the evening. Now, it does not work for my son as far as making him ready for bedtime but then I also read it at any time of the day I want along with his other books in his library.What I think is unique about Goodnight Moon (as well as other familiar old classics) is that it takes some rather big words (no, it is not the ""Cat in the Hat"" but we love those type of stories also) and makes them into a story that can be read over and over and over and by the time you are most likely truly tired of it...and all, if you are reading it regularly enough. Your child may start to really get used to hearing the words and then one day...before you know it they can read some it.That is powerful, teaching your child to read. Now, you can try to teach your child with any book but Goodnight Moon isn't a decent effort for some children. It has some color and for newborns the black and white. I like the fact that this book is actually going to be easy for my child to read it himself when he hears it constantly.

    This is a small comprehensible world, invoked with poetics and illustrated with grace
  
",5.0,Bachelier,"Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2006","









  
  
    
  ""Goodnight Moon"" succeeds beyond such sobriquets as ""classic"" or ""perfect,"" for this work is that rarest achievement in art and letters: a melding of the visual with the sonic, and always presented in an atmosphere of intimacy and security. This provides a psychological construct for healthy learning that is imperative for a child's growing mind and emotional maturation. Only the Christmas Story of the Gospel of Luke, Chapter 2, is superior in Western literature in nurturing a child's introduction to mapping the world with words, built from visual clues. ""Goodnight Moon"" is an indispensable foundational work for a child's confident construct of the spoken, written and read English language. The dimension of emotional comfort invoked with this work cannot be overstated.What makes this work so remarkable? In contrast to the mad world of Dr. Suess, where made-up words serve with legitimacy of ancient ones, the vocabulary of ""Goodnight Moon"" is normal. In addition, the rhyming scheme, the scansion, the subject, and the illustrations are all both in perfect balance and contrast that engage the child on both the whole (the sentence, or the whole illustration) and the specific (the individual word, or a visual detail in the pictures). This is a small comprehensible world, invoked with poetics and illustrated with grace.It is in the processes of reading aloud, pointing to pictures and words, with the repetition of familiar themes (""goodnight"") and subjects (objects in a nursery) that the concept of printed words signifying objects (both illustrated ones, and real ones) and actions becomes incarnate in a child's mind. Ricoeur's ""the symbol gives rise to the thought"" has its birthplace here. This is the ideal vehicle to begin your child's journey of mastering comprehension and action of and in the world with symbols.We own the board book edition, and I highly recommend it for its sturdy use for each new member of a growing family.This is the first book our six year old daughter was able to read to her two year old brother, a moment all families should experience. I urge you to read ""Goodnight Moon"" regularly to your child as a gift for his future.

  What a great company to work with! Goodnight Moon was the very first book I learned how to read (more like memorize). Such a special book for me and now I want to share it with my little one. Books are meant to be shared so I fully believe in buying ""used"". This Comapny stands by their quality promise to its customers and while MY book had to be returned (it had pages stuck by food junk...gross) their customer service trumped even Amazon and took care of me via email within an hour. Don't hesitate to buy from these folks, they are a standup company! Thanks!!!

    An hypnotic little book that brings the day to a safe close.
  
",5.0,R. C. NELSON,"Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2006","









  
  
    
  This book deals with nearly everything in a child's room and house, and page-by-page, it says ""Goodnight"" to real items as well as some that had their birth in fairy tales. It says ""Goodnight"" to these items, ending with ""Goodnight noises everywhere.""  All of this is from the perspective of a rabbit in bed that children seem to ""know"" represents them. I cannot add much to the existing posts, but I think I understand why the mother of 23-month old twins ""just does not get it.""Twins have a very close sibling to share scary sounds like things that go bump in the night, while most children do not.This little book is very rugged, so you do not have anything to worry about if your child plays with it.I rate this book five stars, and I believe that it will remain popular as long as hardback books survive. The back of the book reads, ""This classic bedtime story, which has lulled generations of children to sleep, is the perfect first book to share with a child.""  That, it is.

    A true childhood classic
  
",5.0,Peggy Vincent,"Reviewed in the United States October 3, 2003","









  
  
    
  To those of us who raised our children on this book, nudging them toward sleep each night with one more, please Mommy, just one more book and please Mommy, please make it Goodnight Moon, the opening lines will always be familiar: In the great green room there was a red balloon - - - and finally there was a spoon and a brush and a bowl full of mush, and a quiet old lady whispering `Hush.'As you slowly turn the pages, drinking in the images, you begin to notice things. The room gets darker with each page, the hands of the clock progress. The mouse is always there, but it is sometimes hard to find him. The kittens get drowsy, and so does the bunny. There's less mush in the bowl. And most of all the moon rises; in each picture it's a little higher above the windowsill.Simply brilliant.Always enough to make a tired parent drowsy, for sure, and usually it works for the child, too! This classic book should be given to every first-time pregnant mom at her baby shower.

  This item gets 5 stars because I LOVE THIS BOOK for kids. This particular purchase was supposed to be the BOARD book so there was a bit of  mix up but was straightened out satisfactorily. The story is simple in this book and after a few times you will almost memorize the words and just hold the book for the child to see the pictures. Very easy read (of course) and delightful for the kiddies just before bedtime. I suggest the BOARD book for the younger ones so the pages won't get torn -- I purchase this book for all the baby showers I go to!!

  This is the type of book both parents and children adore.  It's not too long that it gets exhausting and the kids look forward to hearing it.  It has very familiar rhymes and illustrations.  I have gone through many copies of Goodnight Moon with my four children. They love to finish the sentences and point out the telephone and the stars and other things not mentioned in the text.  They love the sounds of the words.  It's often a child's first introduction to the cadence of poetry.I frequently buy this as a gift for a new baby.  I recommend buying it as a board book as it will last longer.  Also, you can get this book if you get tired of reading Goodnight Moon.

  Just like many other children, my boys love reading Goodnight Moon before bedtime.  Our first copy was destroyed when my 2,5-year-old didn't enjoy his newborn brother's presence.  Tough times...  We ordered a second copy, now reading to both 15mo and 3,5yo.  It's short enough that my 15yo can keep focused.Even though it lacks emotion, somehow my 3,5-year-old chooses Goodnight Moon over Guess How Much I Love You.  He's a very sensitive and emotional boy, so I thought he would prefer a book that talked about emotions.  Not sure what the magic is for my little one, but whatever it is, Goodnight Moon's got it.

  This book was given to me as a baby shower gift from a dear friend.  When I first looked through it, I didn't see what all the fuss over this book was about.  The pictures are not lively, some of them are even black and white.  I thought it was just okay.  With that said, my 8-month old daughter loves this book.  She loves when I read it to her before bed.  It is the only book that we have that she will sit through repeatedly.  Everytime I try to throw a new book in she starts fussing half way through.  So, I usually just end up reading this book over and over again.  Great for small children!  Highly recommend!

  This book is a must have for all young children. I have purchased this book three times now for my two year old daughter because of how she literally loved it to pieces. We are now in the habit of saying goodnight to every household item on our way to bed before story time and we even say good bye to everything when we leave our home. She now prefers to read it to me since she has memorized the easy to recall story pattern. The Susan Sarandon narration of it on YouTube also was a lifesaver while waiting in line for rides at Disneyland. Made many people in line a fan of it too since whining kids were all quietly entertained by it.

  I never read it as a child but my husband loved it. So, we've made it part of our 22 month old's bed time routine, right before bed his daddy reads it to him. I don't know what it is about this book that makes children at such a young age be able to sit and listen to it. It was also recommended to me as a staple for kids his age by my cousin who is a speech therapist and works with early intervention and elementary aged children.  Most of his other books are just tactile board books with animals and such.

  Do Not Buy This Tiny Size!!!  Get the ""Lap Edition.""  I was very disappointed to receive a small board book of Goodnight Moon.  I have 4 children, and this beloved book ended up needing to be replaced for each child.  The first 3 copies were all about 9 ¼"" by 11,"" so I did not think to look down the page on the Amazon web site for the exact specifications in the shipping details.  Goodnight Moon has some bold pages, then paler pages and muted back and white pages, as (ostensibly some nights) your young child reading with you becomes more sleepy.  It is great fun to find the small mouse on many of the pages, which is not so fun in a darkened nursery in the small pages that came with this latest shipment - fully ¼ of the size of my earlier copies.  If nothing else, the larger pages fill your baby's view with the story, and not all the nifty distractions elsewhere in the house.

  The book is about a little one saying goodnight.  When I read it I found myself looking for the different objects because they are not real obvious.  I can see this as teaching a child to be observant.  One picture is presented as a whole room then the following pages show what the object looked like in the whole room.  There was even a page where the little one said goodnight to nobody and the page was blank.Very entertaining and a great way to bond with a child.

Bright colors, simple pictures, an easy storyline for toddlers to understand and words that lend themselves to an easy almost sing-song cadence...it was the last thing my children heard every night before they went to bed and a welcome part of their night time routine.

  I've been reading this to my 7-month-old daughter every night before bed since she was a newborn, and she still is just entranced by it.  I think the alternation between pages with full color drawings and pages with only black and white pictures helps to keep her interested.  And she seems to really like all the rhymes.  It's the perfect length for a nighttime story and I love having it a part of our nightly ritual.

  What can I say.  Its a classic for a reason.  The story is simple with a soothing cadence to calm baby, and bright enough colors and pictures to keep baby's interest.  The book is substantial, which is a good thing, since it gets a lot of use.  When I'm done reading, my daughter takes the book and gazes at the picture on the final page for a while, then closes the book, caresses the cover, hands it to me and knows that its time too sleep.

",5.0,thewahlmighty,"Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2010","









  
  
    
  Goodnight Moon is a short poem meant to be read to a child before going to bed. It begins by naming all the things in a room, from ""two little kittens and a pair of mittens"" to ""a comb and a brush and a bowl full of mush."" Following this, ""good night"" wishes are granted to everything previously named.The illustrations match the book's purpose wonderfully. For example, a bright green room greets the child at book's start and then gets progressively darker.Goodnight Moon is not the only bed-time storybook, but it is one of the most highly recommended for a good reason. The book prepares a child for bed in the best way possible: it gives him the comforting reassurance that everything is in its place and all is well--in his room and in the world outside

  One of my favorite books growing up and when my children were small. I had to get one for my niece. Love how the book is durable enough for a 1 year old and small enough to throw in a backpack for her when we're out running around.

  I love the soothing rhymes. One year olds start to appreciate it for this reason, I believe. I love the little mouse that pops up here and there. I would give it the full 5 stars but I'm not a huge fan of the bright green and red in the room, I think its a bit overwhelming. :p But children seem to love it anyway.

  At first I thought the book was a little odd and did not understand the hype about it but after reading it to my baby I noticed how soothing it was to her. I read it to her before bed every night, often more than once. This book has bright pictures to capture baby's attention. She follows my finger as I point to the tiny details in the room. The story also has a wonderful rhyme to it. This book is a keeper!

  Don't know what it is about this book, but it is amazing. The illustrations are repetative, the text sometimes ridiculous, (""goodnight nobody""?!) But it works magic.

  Another awesome classic here. I ordered this with the very hungry caterpillar, because it's just one of those books every family should have. My kids love finding the rodent as he travels through the story on each page.The rhythmic rhyming structure is perfect to (hopefully) lull the little ones off to slumberland. This is the best bedtime story, because as it progresses, it gets gradually darker and darker (hey, just like in real life...) until it ends and the bunny goes to sleep, and hopefully so do your kids. Mine (at least one of them) however, weren't particularly interested in sleep, so we had other battles to contend with. Oh yeah, it's a board book, so tiny digits can maneuver it easily. It can also withstand a fair amount of biting as well. I would usually take it away if they started biting it though, cause I'd rather be able to pass it along to another kid.

  This book was a childhood staple of mine and I decided to purchase for my friend's baby shower to add in a gift box I made for her new little girl on the way. I was excited it had arrived, but not too excited when it came pretty beat up. It was dented, scraped up, and basically just looked in poor shape. :(

  Goodnight Moon is one of the first books I remember my mom reading to me.  Now, I get to read it to (and with) my kids.  The story is simple and sweet.  My five year old can read most of the words and it is fun, after reading this to her so often when she was a baby, to hear her read it to her little sister.

  I learned of this book over thirty years ago, reading Jim Trelease's book, The Read-Aloud Handbook. Each of our several children had their own copy, because they read Goodnight Moon to death. I've given it to each of my grandchildren and many new moms as a baby gift. There is no finer book for children aged 6-30 months. They love to discover the mouse on every page. Once my oldest daughter was visiting and reading my copy to one of her children. A visiting friend, whose toddler had heard me read it on many occasions, laughed and commented. ""You read that with exactly the same voice inflections as your mom."" We looked at each other and smiled. After hearing me read it thousands of times, it must have imprinted like a top 40 tune. You can't go wrong with Goodnight Moon, although I prefer the hardcover to the board book; the artwork is superior in the hardcover.

  I bought this for my grandson's birthday. He will be one in August. I'm sure he will love it as his mother did when she was little and his cousin (who will be two in August) loves her copy. Every young child should have his/her own copy of this wonderful classic. The colored  pictures are soothing and the black and white pictures show objects very clearly-making them easier to spot on the colored pages. The rhyme is beautiful and not complicated. My granddaughter, like many children before her, likes to look for the things mentioned in the text. She has decided that she is the little bunny who doesn't want to go to sleep, and I am ""the little old Lady whispering 'Hush.""'

  My son has loved this book since he was 3 months old. He loves turning the pages, and the color and black & white alternating story is just delightful. We read it to him every night, and it has helped give him a tear-free nightly routine. I recommend it to every mommy and daddy within the sound of my voice and the site of my review. Enjoy your babies!

  Who does not love this book?  Thirty one years ago, it was a present to me and my new born.  I still have it, but it does not look new.  Years of my sons being read this book, and 25 years of reading to my Day care children, has taken it's toll.  I was invited to a baby shower last month and was asked to give a favorite book signed instead of a card.  I bought this and Runaway Bunny.  She was very pleased.  The other books I bought were for my Daycare.  The kids never get tired of them and neither do I.
