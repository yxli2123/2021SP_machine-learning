  My mom LOVED this record player! She has collected records for years and my siblings and I grew up listening to records... since then she no longer had one so I was happy to get her this one for Christmas and she was thrilled and played it right away. Being a modern woman she also uses Bluetooth now so she was surprised she could do both on this beautiful record player. This has now taken center stage in her bedroom and she uses it every day.

    As expected: beginner quality, decent starter

  Just tested this out for my 14 yo first turntable for Xmas. Sound quality is as expected for a portable starter player. Reminds me of an old Walkman type radio reception. Music comes through just fine (we’ve all gotten use to top of the line tech and this just isn’t it. Again- as expected).Shipping was swift, no damage and item was very well packaged, protected needles, plastic wrapped.The turntable piece is a little bit questionable as far as quality (cheap plastic) yet with care the device will be great for a child’s first experience.

    Quit Working, will not turn on
  
",1.0 ,Brad,"Reviewed in the United States August 12, 2019","









  
  
    
  Nice while it lasted, but after a few months, with very little use, it simply will not turn on.  In fact I was using it, turned it off for a bit while I was doing something else, came back and turned it on - nothing.  I do have an electronics background - the power supply is fine and power is making it to the main board but that's it, there is no power making it to the platter control board.  There are no obvious signs of any shorts or burnt out components and since everything besides the capacitors are sub-miniature components any further home repair is not an option.You get what you pay for and this appears to be a hit or miss product - you'll either get one that keeps working or you'll get one that dies shortly after arrival.  Go ahead, spin the wheel!!  No, I would not recommend this product.PS:  Due to other reviews mentioning problems with the electronics I highly recommend you DO NOT leave this plugged in when not in use.

    Cute, basic turntable
  
",4.0 ,kindle user,"Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  It's cute, it's very basic, and it plays LPs. So it does what it says it'll do. Four stars because the sound isn't great but honestly I didn't expect it to be. I think you could connect it to a stereo but tbh I don't listen to albums like in the old days, one after another after another. It's fun to pop an album on from the 70s or 60s and listen to it then flip it over and listen to the other side. One gets used to endless streams of music with all the digital stuff we have nowadays but there's something satisfying about playing an LP you used to play ages ago.Oh and the needle drops quite lightly on the album, not fast like one might expect on a cheaper turntable like this.

   If you rarely play records or are not much of Vinyl collector, then sure it's probably alright. It comes with everything you need to turn on and play records. And it's as portable as a record player can be.But the record player is poorly designed and records will wobble quote a bit. If you buy a lot of records, you'll eventually come across a record that skips a lot or the sound sounds warped, even though the record is fine.So a good record player for the rare Vinyl listener, or someone who wants to see if it's something that will even gain their interest.But if you want to build a Vinyl collection, and keep your records in the best shape, you'll probably need to buy a more costly record player. Or look into and buy attachments that will help protect the records or get them to play better on this one, if that is even a possibility.So I'd only recommend it if you really want the portablility, or of you just want something cheap and affordable, and aren't worried about potential warping or damage to a Vinyl over time due to poor design of this player.

    Great Gift Idea
  
",5.0 ,Susan Heavens,"Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2017","









  
  
    
  Our unit worked as expected out of the box. The turntable rotates completely flat, the needle arm picks up well with the lifter and drops very quietly onto the record.  At the end of the tracks it stops the turntable with the needle in the center of the record.  The sound is quite loud enough for a single room very similar to the original units that we played in the 60/70's.  Certainly not HiFi but considering the tiny speakers it's very good, more treble than base.  Plugging in the RCA or Headphone outputs to another speaker system gives better sound with more bass.  Note that the Bluetooth is only a receiver and so you'll need to plug in a BT Transmitter into the RCA or headphone jacks if you want to play records via BT to another BT speaker system.The black case looks nice and ""retro"" on top of our wooden stereo cabinet and we like the idea that we can shut the case and keep the dust out or just snap closed the latch and pick it up like a mini suitcase and take it with us to someplace else.  Great value for the money, a good ""novelty"" gift for someone who has a stash of old 33 records that they haven't listened to for 40 years!

",5.0 ,Russell,"Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was concerned because of many of the negative reviews on here, but I really like the Victrola portable suitcase record player. First of all, the sound is great. I have played vinyl records and songs from my phone using the Bluetooth feature, and the sound is actually pretty loud. The speakers don't sound tinny. The only downside is that there's not too much bass, but you could hook up more high quality speakers, but I don't feel the need to do so. This record player's sound quality is much better than a Jensen record player I had a while back.I also like that there is a knob to switch between Bluetooth, Line In, and Phonograph. The light even changes color to indicate which mode you're on. My phone easily connected to the record player via Bluetooth, and the sound quality is excellent.Lastly, the look of the record player is really great. The material doesn't feel cheap, and the turquoise color really pops. The suitcase look is very vintage. I highly recommend this record player.

  I was so excited to give this Christmas gift to my spouse, who is a true music lover. I could barely wait for her to open it and her eyes lit up like a little kid.  She immediately grabbed it and set it up.  The sound was great-for a few minutes.  Then it started to skip.  And skip.  I had read the reviews and purchased an accessory to help with this problem but unfortunately it did not stop the skipping at all.  The hardest thing was watching the light go out of my wife's eyes as she turned this thing off and moved on.There are no words to express how disappointed I am in this product.  I will be returning it for a refund and I guess now that I have all of these albums, I will invest in a more expensive model; as I should have in the beginning. This was such a cute product. I was really hoping that the quality would be as stated.  So bummed.

  Remembering the album collection that My parents have and the record player from so many years ago that no longer works, left me craving the vintage sound from back in the day. This new school record player with Bluetooth is a perfect mash up of old school and new school.The sound is clear. The connection was easy. The only minor issue I had was the needle skipping in the beginning. I did a little research and just like my parents did back in the day (directly from customer support), a couple of quarters to weigh the needle down and no more skipping. I am very happy with my purchase!

  I purchased his items as a birthday gift.  The item stopped working within a couple months.  It was too late to return through Amazon but should have been covered under the manufactures warranty and Amazon provided me with the contact information.  I do love that Amazon is helpful!However, Customer Support for Victrola advised that I should try to ""use a different power cord with the same specifications if I had one available, and see if the unit powers on"".  If it did not work, they would ""arrange to have a replacement power cord sent"".However, since receiving that email on 12/4, they have not returned any emails.I have tried calling a couple times but do not get to a person.It is very frustrating.

    Second Try

  This is my second record player from Victoria.  The first was a Christmas gift, and I excitedly put on a brand new record...and it skipped.  I tried an old record...skipped.  It skipped on every record I tried.So, I returned it.  I ordered a DIFFERENT record player, it was so shoddy, and felt so cheap that I returned THAT one.  But, at least it played my records in full.Then I started researching.  I’m not enthusiastic enough to spend over $100, so I started searching for “best record players under $100” and this one was the TOP of multiple lists.  I figured my first one was a fluke, so I tried again. And SURPRISE, I have the exact same issue.  And even when it does play, the static is wild, and if I turn the volume up too high the sound starts to distort.

  The sound that is produced is not in stereo. I thought I could connect external speakers but the outputs aren’t working. Bluetooth doesn’t allow you to connect to a Bluetooth speaker, but does allow you to play music through the record player, and sounds wonderfully mono. I was so excited to get this and I’m very disappointed.

  Added a video.  Ice portable product. No Tom control. Nice listening to Vinyl again. I did order some inexpensive speakers that r  quality along with a subwoofer & equalizer. When I did the demonstration in the video u u can’t hear me for a few seconds. I got some great speakers woth a small sub woofer and an equalizer to take more control over the sound being produced outof this until.

But I am extremely picky in sound and record a lot of things and work with video production so that is why I want to add bigger speakers and a receiver.This will go with me frlm placeTo place when K get away for the weekend with my best friend (my English Bulldog Ethel Mae). And yes: she digs the new portable player too.This would make a great inexpensive gift. My daughter got one years back. It is fun to see her get into LP’s now.

",4.0 ,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2021","









  
  
    
  The unit came to me in what appeared to be open-box. The player itself looked new and perfect, but there was an obviously torn-open plastic insert in it that contained the power supply at one time. So to sum up, no power cord included, and I could not use the unit. Contacted Amazon, and they were prompt to return my money and even said that I could keep the player. Thanks for that Amazon, but I now have to figure out how to get my ""free"" player to work. I ordered an after market power supply for it and it worked perfectly. I am happy with the player, it works great, and I can now listen to my classic recordings the way they were meant to be heard. The built-in speakers aren't anything to write home about though. Please connect it via RCA plugs to your music system or get some powered speakers. I didn't rate the Bluetooth capability on this because I haven't tested it, and will probably not use it anyway. Is this for ""beginners?"" maybe, but it works exactly like the classic record players of old, so if you're a younger person and have never used one, read up on it and/or get an older fella like me to help you.

  So my trusty Sony Direct Drive I’ve had for years needs some serious repairs — finding myself in this pickle, I ordered an AudioTechnica with amazing reviews. However, upon receiving it: the unit was not only faulty, it also damaged two irreplaceable records of mine! I was so furious, I immediately asked for a return. At this point I was just looking for something that would be a reliable backup for the time being and after I fix my Sony.Pros: this thing is reliable as hellIt has a ton of very intuitive featuresThe arm is manually operated (no more auto arm failures!)And it has an auto stop feature.All of the cables are replaceable! I use gold RCA cables for sound qualityIt’s portable!Cons:the needles it comes with aren’t great but they’re just as good as AudioTechnica’s needles. I was able to find an elliptical needle that’s compatible on a bidding website for under $12 and the sound quality is even better than units costing 4x as much.PS: it looks way more classy and timeless in person than it does in the pictures (I got the black version)So, whether you’re a beginner or an enthusiast, I highly recommend this item. And I highly recommend getting an elliptical needle to replace the stock one!Also, you will want to cut out some felt to put on the turntable under your records, just to be safe.

  I loved the idea of this product. I bought this for my 4 year old for Christmas.  It was and still is his favorite thing.  Seeing his love for vinyl records and music in general is one of my favorite experiences in life.  I could never return it for that reason alone.That being said, from a technical standpoint, the build quality is really bad. Right out of the box, I noticed that the turntable itself isn't mounted properly on its base. Almost like it's warped or something. The tone arm is super loose and makes it a bit tough to position it where you want it.At the end of the day, it's a gift that my 4 year old loves more than anything.  However, if I'd known that the build quality was going to be so poor before I bought it, I would have passed for something better.

    Decent record player for those new to vinyl, may need to modify
  
",4.0 ,Caleb,"Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  This isn't a bad record player, it has decent sound quality and does what it was made to do. It is a pretty good starter or budget player for listeners branching out or getting back into vinyl. That said it does have its own issues. Out of the box this record player would skip on older vinyls and there was a strange scratch noise when I played any of my collection. After a few minutes of scrutiny using an inherited scratched record (something I keep for diagnostic tests for any new player), I found that the skip was because the arm didn't lower enough to maintain contact with the vinyl. The fix was a rubber disc that I had left over from a broken record player. The rubber disc raised the record high enough to maintain needle contact even on slightly warped records. The second issue of the scratching noise turned out to be caused by a plastic guard at the base of the arm. This small piece of plastic would rub at the edge of the vinyls while spinning producing the scratch noise. That fix was simply using a fine fingernail emery board (800/10000 grit) to remove just enough material to put a stop to the noise but not impede the function of the plastic guard. After those simple fixes I had no problems with the record player.

  I had jumped off the vinyl train several years ago, but lately I got some 7"" singles that have songs I can't find elsewhere, and decided I should probably get a turntable so I could actually hear them. If you are looking for something to occasionally play old records on, and don't care that much about superb sound quality, this is a decent choice. It plays just fine, but the speakers GREATLY limit the bass. If you are an audiophile and really care about great sound quality, be prepared to dish out a lot more money (and if you're buying new records, you should be able to afford that). So, for a 'beginner',or someone who just wants to pull out a record every so often, this is a nice affordable choice (the one I got was just a little over $30).

  So for the price, I guess it's ok. I've read some horror stories about how eventually this player will wear down your vinyl, so I was wary of that. The purple color with the rose gold hardware is very cute. The speakers are kind of terrible, but that's to be expected. My main problem was with the sound quality, even when connected to nicer speakers.I hooked this up to my soundbar and listened to a record. The sound was kind of rough and wobbly. I then played the same record on a vintage turntable and it sounded 10 times better, removing all the noise and strengthening the overall sound. Then I played it on an Audio-Technica turntable and again, the sound was even better. I decided it was worth a little more money to get a turntable that sounds better and has less of a chance of wrecking my records. Admittedly I'm not super concerned about damage over time to my records, since I don't buy expensive vinyl and mostly purchase from thrift stores, but it was still something to consider.The sound just doesn't compare. If you really don't care about sound quality, record longevity, or just want something that will play records and look cute and vintage, by all means grab one of these. The price is good for a trendy piece of home decor.

  Our teenage daughter (who is really an 80s child at heart) loved the cool designs of the Victrola Record Player.  Unfortunately this record player seems to be a very poor quality.  We bought our first one at Kohl""s and it was this year's Christmas present.  After opening it we realized it was missing its needle.  We bought replacement needles on Amazon and tried again.  With the new needle in place we spun a record. OMG! The speakers were horrible.  They played very softly and the volume knob did nothing.  We returned it to Kohl's.After getting home, we went on Amazon Smile (everybody should shop via Smile and support a charity such as The Multiple System Atrophy Coalition)).  The reviews on the Victrola were among the best so we decided to give it another try, assuming the first one from Kohl's was a dud.The new vintage Victrola Record Player arrived quickly. Our daughter was so excited. We unpackaged it and checked the needle. It was there! We put on a record and turned it on.  The music came on at a nice sound level. The first verse was perfect.  But then...... the record started skipping.  We tried a brand new record. More skipping. We could not get a record to play well.  We turned it off and the music died.Two busts and we were done.  We returned it hassle free and bought a different brand (similar style). The new record player sounds great and the same records that skipped on the Victrola Record Player play perfectly on our new brand.Maybe we just got two duds, but we just don't trust the quality and are glad we moved on.

So diamond needle or any other type of needles are compatible with our turntables.If the unit still does not work, please have the unit returned to the retailer for a replacement/exchange.Regards,SamCustomer SupportVICTROLA1 Channel Drive, Port Washington, NY 11050Support: +1(877) 483-2497 (toll free)So I figured i would give these a try. the sound improved and the records DID NOT skip.

  The sound quality coming out of this when playing a record is phenomenal!That being said, using the speakers via Bluetooth connection is absolutely worthless.  Playing music directly from my phone's speaker is indescribably louder than playing via Bluetooth through the record player's speakers, even at full volume.  I thought the Bluetooth feature was to transfer the record's sound to another device, which would be awesome, though obviously unlikely.

  The Bluetooth function does NOT allow you to play a record through an external bluetooth speaker. You can only use the record player's speakers to INPUT music from an external source, and the record player's sound quality is lower than a typical iPhone. Not knowing this, after unpacking unit, I switched it to Bluetooth and paired with my iPhone. The turntable stopped and music from my iPhone playlist began (faintly) playing through the record player.  Thought it was broken until I read another review from a few days ago and realized that you CANNOT USE THIS to transmit music FROM the record player TO an external bluetooth speaker. (might work with AUX cord, haven't tried).  The product description (obliquely) says so but I didn't catch this before buying.  I will keep it as it's cute and only purchased to play some very old childhood records that have sentimental value only.

Super excited when she opened it until we played our first record...Initially, we thought we had purchased records that were warped, as the newer vinyl (Harry Styles in particular...sorry Harry🤓) kept skipping, but found the culprit after a lot of googling, which revealed similar complaints about this record player: improper weight and balance to the tone arm (for those like me that aren't audiophiles, translation: the needle isn't pressing down hard enough to hold in the record groove, so it skips in certain spots). As I did more research, this seems to be more of an issue with newer records in particular-maybe due to the way they are produced. Several of the newer records we bought actually could be seen wobbling slightly up and down on the player as it turned (I now see that in several video reviews). If you really like the look and are determined to buy this, the ""fix"" is to add a small amount of weight above the needle. We added a penny right above the needle to test (apparently this was a fix in the old days when records skipped) and YEAH!!! immediately eliminated skipping on all records for us. The new issue: you are now potentially adding too much weight and therefore wearing out your record faster (as well as a penny that may fall off ocassionally. Bottom line, I would suggest passing on this and look for a record player that has a better balanced arm, or better yet, spend a little extra money and buy a player with an adjustable tone arm (which you set to a specific gram weight to hold the needle down). Rock on Harry!

  I was hopeful. With a mix of good and bad reviews, I was hopeful that maybe for some it just wasn't up to their standard and they were expecting a quality similar to a $200+ turntable.Once I opened this up and had a look at it, I quickly realized why this is a $40-$60 turntable.The entire top panel that contains the nobs and switches is a cheap looking plastic. This includes the platter, luckily there are soft rubber parts of the platter to keep the record in place. All of this was sort of expected for the price.After placing a record on and lowering the needle, the most shocking thing about this product forced its way into my ears... The sound of this product is A B S O L U T E L Y horrible. Some reviews mention no bass, but i wasnt expecting NO bass at all. The sound from this sound like the cheapest speakers they could have possibly placed in this. Theyre like the type of speakers that would be on a fast food kids meal toy.I dont know if I got a bad egg, but I cannot believe that anyone thinks that this is good quality sound unless they've been paid or reimbursed to review the product, or have never used anything other than cheap speakers.I honestly believe i could go find better sounding speakers at the dollar store.This of course is not the end of the world. I just grabbed another bluetooth speaker that I had and plugged in an aux chord and that resolved the speaker issue.In addition to the cheap speakers, the platter wobbles quite a bit. And on top of that, one of the rubber spots on the platter was lower than the others, making the record wobble even more. So the sound of the music was very unstable and was very warped sounding.I managed to partially resolve this by placing a few pieces of electrical tape on top of the lower rubber piece.For anyone looking for a beginner record player. This would be it. But dont expect miracles.Will be returning to hopefully get a better version of this product and will update my rating if it is indeed betted.

   After about 10 hours of use, it started squeaking like crazy. Loud comical squeaks... like I have all sorts of things in my home that turn, rotate, and have electric motors. None of them squeak. But this sounds like a fart every rotation.Update: I took it apart and discovered a small piece of plastic that had wedged itself into the turning mechanism. I was able to put it back together, but I had to look up tutorials on how to get the belt back on. A slightly complicated repair for something the size of a fingernail. It works fine now, but still keeping the 1 Star review because of the hassle of having to fix a practically new record player.

  While this is no means for an audiophile, it is a great record player for majority of listeners. It has great portability so you can plug up at a cookout or your friend's house. The speakers don't have amazing quality but that's not why you'd buy this one; I use my audio technica and my stereo system for HQ sound. BUT it has a headphone jack so you can listen in great quality! This makes a great player for anyone who doesn't care about audiophile sound quality so this makes a really cool gift for like 90% of people. I've bought 3 so far; one for me and two for gifts to family members. The Bluetooth function is great as it allows it to be used to play music from your phone (Hard to carry 15 vinyls to a picnic). All in all, this makes a great record player for its price and makes a wonderful gift to anyone who maybe wants to play records but maybe doesn't want to shell out 90 plus bucks for a full blown stereo compatible player. My grandpa and mom loved these as gifts because they love the nostalgia of records but also don't know how to set up and hook up a stereo and speakers for a full player. I still keep mine for its portability as most full players are not portable by any means. Great product!

  Our son used his two times, and on the third time, it smoked, smelling of electrical burning, and stopped working. Luckily, he had not fallen asleep and turned the power off immediately. After contacting the seller to request a refund/return/exchange, the seller closed the request with a pat message about ""the purchase being in the final stages so they're unable to process a cancellation.""  They did not address the issues presented, nor the refund request, leading one to believe that they knew they had a defective product, but could still keep the money. Sadly, they weren't wrong. Another reviewer stated that neither the first nor the second player she received some time ago worked.  Amazon cannot support a refund through their claim process as the item arrived ""intact.""  We now have no turntable & no money, but do feel blessed to still have our family and home safe. Interestingly, I was required to choose a star in order to provide a review.  I would give ZERO stars to this product and to the seller, as they must know by now that this product is defective and catches on fire.

  As is usual with most items on Amazon, as soon as negative reviews creep up, the item is reposted and the score is somewhat ""reset"".  Wish Amazon would fix this, but hey, they're making money so they obviously don't care.Record players are not usually made for travel use (or cheap for this case) because of the heft the arm a record player requires in order to have sufficient and tune-able weight on a record.  This is important because if enough weight is not placed on the arm, then you get skipping.  What can you do?  You can ghetto rig it by taping a penny or quarter at the top of the tip and see if this rectifies it.  If it fixes it, then it means you have a cheap record player.  AKA A Victrola record player.  Don't get this.  Just get a real one.  This might be worth it when it drops to $20, but not any more than that.

   Like that its compact and comes with adapter to play 45's.  Red and white rca outputs in back. I'll plug into a mixer then the skies the limit once I get the replacement. Plugged a bluetooth transmitter into headphone jack then paired with Amazon Echo. Be sure to play last song till the end on all size records as 'auto off' feature can be defective as shown in video.  Built in Bluetooth is a receiver not a transmitter and worked perfectly.  Built in speakers worked perfectly.  ALL manufacturers sometimes produce lemons. I will lower rating if replacement is also defective.Update: Replacement works great.

  Love this record player, it looks great in a room pretty enough to be decor and it sounds great. I’ve received so many compliments from friends and neighbors who all want to buy there own. Speaking of price it’s such good quality for such a low price It’s really easy to use, the bluetooth works great i love being able to play Pandora from my phone when I don’t want to listen to one of my records I also enjoy playing podcasts on it while I cook dinner. It’s portablility is another great feature we like to sit on our back deck and listen to music while watchin the sunset. The white/gold is beautiful the gold really stands out and goes with my decor vintage decor it doesn’t look cheap at all only downfall is that the inside is like a velvet and I know its going to get dirty from any lil speck of dust and idk how I plan on cleaning it when it does, it’s nice to be able to close the lid to keep that from happening it came with a couple small marks n spots on it being that it’s white u can see very detail and I notice everything I definitely would not buy white again. I think the player gets loud enough I can hear it very well in other rooms but my husbands would prefer to get some other speakers for when we want it even louder

  I'm happy with this little record player, it's exactly what I expected. It's not high-end, the speakers aren't the best, but its imperfections add to the vintage sounding experience I wanted from a record player. Plays my old records fine (vintage Beatles, Elvis, etc), as well as my new. It has jacks on the back that I'm sure would allow me to hook it up to my stereo if I decide to go for a bigger sound at some point.The turn table has a wobble to it, but I don't ever remember owning one that didn't. Arm seems weighted fine, no need to tape a penny to it like the one I had back in the day.

  It took me a year to get into vinyl because I was afraid that I wouldn't get the right products or I wouldn't be prepared to have a collection. While this was true and it was expensive to get started, I have found that this record player is perfectly suitable for people just starting out and even more so for people who aren't concerned with collecting and keeping quality on records.If you just want to experience vinyl at a cheaper price this works just fine. There is some concern that it is damaging my records, but I've also found that people who talk about vinyl's tend to have very personalized ideas of what constitutes good record maintenance and I'm just fixing my process myself as I go along. I will say that something about it seems to be off balance? Sometimes a record just wont play right without adjustments. Otherwise it works fine.

  Great product especially for the price. Very pleased with condition since it was well protected. Works flawlessly without any problems. The sound from the speakers are clear from using records. When using bluetooth (BT as it's abbreviated on device) it doesn't sound as great as it should so that could improve a tad bit. Maybe adding more bass into the speakers will make it improve better. As a whole, it worth the value.

  I bought this as a gift for my niece for Christmas. Since I wanted to leave some sort of review I took it out of the box to check for functionality and repacked it to wrap for her. The record player comes very well packaged and has many layers of styrofoam to keep it from breaking. The needle inside is also very well protected with wrappings. The power came on and it appeared to function just fine. It also comes with a handle that makes it super east to carry around from place to place.I have since asked my niece if she liked the sound and she said it works and sounds great, and loves playing her records on it. She hasn’t used the Bluetooth option yet, not even sure she ever will, but I guess it’s a nice feature for those that will use it.

   I have zero experience with records or record players. I love everything retro, and I got sick of buying all my music digital (even if it’s convenient!) so I thought why not try out a record player? This was the right price and a pretty color, so I went for it and picked up an Amy Winehouse album at my local Half Price Books. I’m blown away! I had it running in less than 5 minutes and the sound is awesome, no extra speakers needed (I’m just listening to it in my living room). I absolutely recommend for anyone new to vinyl albums. I’ve attached a video and a picture to give you a nice view :)Edit: the turntable on this is wobbly. It's not an even turn, I can notice that the records are unevenly spinning when I view it from the side where I sit on my couch. It doesn't appear to affect the music (that I'm aware of, I don't know what's normal vinyl variance and what isn't) but it's really annoying to see and I'm knocking off a star for it.

   Review of: ""Victrola Vintage 3-Speed Bluetooth Suitcase Turntable with Speakers, Black.""This is a very reasonable priced portable plug-and-play system that allows you to play your LP's in 33/45/78 RPMs.  The case is sturdy and light and the arm and needle are very sensitive.  The sound quality is fantastic for a system this size and you have the option to line in using an AUX cord or use Bluetooth with the system to play music or sound.  I am very impressed by this system.  After having sold my multi-component Onkyo sound system and massive speakers years ago to include my turntable I can once again play my vinyl.  It is wonderful.  The sound and features of this small system rank high.  Five stars.

  This is hand’s down the worst record player I have ever heard. It would turn on, have a long pause, and then begin playing. The records would constantly skip and albums would randomly stop playing altogether. Sound quality was subpar at best, for the times I could actually hear enough. The only thing I can positively state about this thing is that it is indeed portable. If portability is your main criteria here then you’re golden. If you’re looking for more than portability, I’d look elsewhere.

   Let’s start with the number one issue with this record player: the speakers on it suck. They suck bad. They sound awful and I was so disappointed when I first played it because I thought vinyl was supposed to sound good. However, that being said, the record player is excellent if you connect it to a good speaker system. And for the price, I don’t think you can expect much more. I’ll tell you why I decided to keep it, because it’s damn cute.I got the one with the British flag cover and it’s a-dor-a-ble!  I mean I really wanted a retro looking record player and this is spot on. Once I connected it to my Kikburn speaker via an auxiliary cable (not included) I was thrilled.In the end I ended up connecting it to a block rocker max system that I wasn’t getting much use out of except for parties and I’m very happy with the results.I’m a little concerned that you cannot close the cover while playing you records because I have young kids and I’m nervous that they will bump in to it while playing, but I do think it would add considerable bulk to the unit, so I’m not sure I’d actually choose to change that.The auto stop feature is great and pretty much necessary. It’s a bit pointless that it has the option to turn it off because I don’t see why you’d ever want to turn it off.The soft needle drop function is also very convenient and makes playing records extremely easy for anyone.And again, the look of it is just so darn cute, I can’t bring myself to return it for one that say, has a cover or a better speaker etc. Over all for the price I think it’s great. I’m very happy with it, but just know you absolutely will need external speakers to go with your adorable record player.

If you buy new records, maybe you'll get a song or two that plays properly, but the rest of your album will skip. Any new record is doing this for me. I am passed the return window so Amazon agreed to return, but were charging me a restock fee. On a $50 unit.. it's not worth it.

His mother refused my offer of letting him have our old glass fronted stereo cabinet so this was the smaller solution that made them both happy.

  I wasn't expecting much as far as the built in speakers, as I expected it is poor quality, but when you plug in your own speakers the quality doesn't get much better. My phone speakers actually produce a higher quality sound. Even if this were selling for half its price I wouldn't waste my money if I had another chance. I am going to have to get a new record player.

  I had taken my wife for a date night away from the kids, and the place we stayed at had a similar record player (Crosley Cruiser).  We enjoyed it so much, I decided to get this to surprise her.  The first time I used it, it skipped terribly on a new vinyl, causing some permanent damage to the beginning of it.  Bummer.  When I calmed down, I decided to change out the needle with the extra one included with the player.  Viola!  It then played to my expectations, which were not too high.  The sound is a bit tinny, but that is actually what makes it more endearing, along with the retro look.  I contacted Victrola via email, and the same day they said they were sending out a replacement needle for the one that was originally installed.  I don't plan to use the bluetooth function, so I can't attest to that, but I did hook it up to a soundbar successfully using rca cables.  Overall, if you don't plan to start a huge collection and if you aren't concerned about top notch sound, you won't find better for the price.  And if you like to open some wine and have a romantic evening at home every once in awhile, this thing is great.

  First one came and didn't work at all.  So we returned and ordered another.  The next one worked for about 3 days, then the arm stopped working properly.  Now the arm won't electronically move.  You have to manually move it and set in on the record, which is dangerous because you could accidentally scratch the record that way.  So we are returning the second one, because we are afraid if we keep it we will scratch our records and worse, something else will go wrong with the player after the window to return it closes.  To say I am disappointed is an understatement.  I love all things British and bought the British flag design, and it's been since the late 80's/early 90's since I operated a record player.  The thrill of putting on a record was unsurpassed, for the whole day I used it.  I now have to use my husband's record player and not have my own.  Really mad about this purchase, it's cheap and crappy.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME BUYING UNLESS YOU ENJOY RETURNING THINGS MULTIPLE TIMES!!

  This is my first time owning a turntable, born in the late 80s. I don’t know what I was thinking purchasing something with included speakers - a huge mistake. Even cleaning and deep cleaning a new vinyl didn’t stop it from skipping every 15 seconds. It’s not very loud and the sound is crappy. I am not an audiophile, but I should’ve known bare minimum money would produce a bare minimum product. This is only for people that want a device to just listen to the songs, not get lost in the songs. Clearly I need separate speakers for that. Yeah it’s more money but???? If I’m gonna invest money at all.. it won’t be for this piece of crap.

  Want to make  your LPs sound terrible? Then this is your device. Streaming MP3 through your iPhone's mono speaker sounds better.When a quality entry level stand-alone record player costs $150, what do you think you'll get for $40 when the device also packages in a headphone amp, tiny little speakers, and Bluetooth? You get a real crappy sounding, warbly sounding record player with horrible, horrible, all-treble, no-bass sound. Oddly, MP3 streamed into the device via Bluetooth sounds way better than the LPs which points to something horribly wrong with the record player portion of the unit I received.

I read good and bad reviews but thought I would give it a chance. I don’t regret the purchase so far so good. I have only played a few records on it but seems to work well.

  I got this as a Christmas gift for my parents who have a decent record collection but haven’t owned a record player in ages! The outer design is super cute and I love the different color options, and the overall size is just right, not to big, not too small. Setup was very easy. The design of the mechanism itself is simple to use and seems to work really well with both the smaller 45s and the larger standard sized records that we tried with it. It has settings for 3 different types of records. The sound quality for both the actual records and the Bluetooth option were excellent, but is not overly bassy. The volume is more than loud enough to enjoy listening to in the same room or from another. Overall we had SUCH a nice time listening to old records and making new memories with this Victrola, and I highly recommend this product for folks of all ages looking for an affordable and easy way to listen to their records!

  I bought this for the tune of $27.00 for a like new item, and pink camo was the cheapest, so I decided to man up and not pay more for red, or green. The lift arm has a nice glide over feature, and sit on a crib separate from the record plate. I used a mat to create more space for some of my wobblier records. The simple interface ON is also the volume knob, you have a second for phono, line in, and Bluetooth. I tested the Bluetooth this works with my computer, but I don't own by choice a cellphone so can't advise you on that item. This player has a brighter tone, that at first I was like where is the bass, but then you hear the full range of instruments and / or vocals all at the same time. Victrola is a name you can get behind, as the style, price, form, tone, and overall sound is really good. Originally I noticed significantly less lower tones, but more middle and upper tones, and I thought because my other mono system used one really large speaker. You would then naturally get lower tones, however when using my over the ear headphones, I notices the same sound, more high and mid-tones. So I am not sure this has anything to do with the speaker system, as the sound very bass heavy when plugging them into the computer. I tested all sorts of music on this player, Classical a Golden Tone record that really had dynamics. 80's,70's,60's music, techno, classic country, pop, rock, electronic, singer song writer. I would like to hear what 80's rap sounds like on this machine, everything you put on this sounds nice, and you can hear it at low volume, far away from the unit. What played the best Brazil 66, Naked Eye's, Strauss Waltz, Heart.

  Partially my fault for not further reading but this player doesn't connect to external bluetooth speakers rather you can connect other bluetooth sources to use the speakers on this, but why you would want to do that I have no idea as the speakers are pretty sorry on this in the first place. NOW, Victrola does make one that allows you to play your records on an external bluetooth speaker unlike this one. I purchased another so I sent this back. Look for ""dual bluetooth connectivity"" or model  VWM-100SB-LGY you'll be happier.

  So very disappointed to have to give this one star. First of all, I had to wait 2 months for it to arrive. When it got here, I was so excited! It is absolutely adorable, the color was perfect, and it was just what I wanted. Except that it doesn't play a record for more than 30 seconds before it starts skipping. I tried it in several different locations -  hoping maybe it just needed a REALLY flat surface...didn't matter. The sound quality from what I could tell seems ok. I had read a bunch of reviews, both good and bad, and thought there were so many great reviews, I'd risk it. Unfortunately, I got one that seems to have the same skipping issue as a lot of other folks. I'm not saying don't order it (if mine had worked, I'd be giving it at least 4 stars) just buyer beware that yours might be one of the ones that don't work. Sending it back.

    Why Vinyl Is STILL BETTER Than Digital
  
",5.0 ,MooreNoLess,"Reviewed in the United States February 16, 2017","









  
  
    
  Measuring about the size of a small 10 to 14-inch laptop PC, but 5 inches deep, this is the perfect portable and stowaway companion for my 40-plus years of LPs. Yes, it also sounds just right through the two small front facing stereo speakers. This Victrola is also a bigger eargasm when using my larger stereo speakers or extra-bass headphones. To use my medium sized Bluetooth speakers, I will soon buy a RCA cable Bluetooth transmitter for the turntable's RCA output connector on the back.The build and sound quality reminds me so much like the portable album and ""45"" players we had for pop-up parties at school or hang-outs at a girlfriend's house. Yet, it's almost as light as my small laptop PC. This was truly a great buy that I will get a lot of regular use from playing all my ""33s"" and ""45s"" again, and buying some current artists on vinyl. Even my Dad's surviving ""78s"" also sound awesome, but are rough on the easily replaceable stylus.Trust this for certain, uncompressed analog audio sounds much fuller and impressive than the compressed digital sound we've gotten used to over the last 25 years. Don't believe it? Well, you'll hear the same distinct similarities that those mostly ""old head"" jurors heard and knew when listening to the Blurred Lines song (Pharrell and Thicke) while clearly remembering the sounds from Marvin Gayes' worldwide 1977 hit and party jam, Got to Give It Up. ""Old head"" ears (like me) are more attuned to hearing a much fuller spectrum of sounds, ranges and rhythms than people who have only listened to compressed digitized music. Simply, it just sounds more full, real and live.Even the price on this 3-speed stereo turntable was under $50 perfect. It's well worth buying for all those middle and subtle sounds I've been missing in my music and comedy albums. Buy this Victrola portable record player, and FINALLY get your 21st century musical head and ears right --- at a low cost. Your mind, body, soul and ears will thank you.

  This summer I enlisted the help of my two granddaughters ages 10 and 13 to help me catalog a large amount of records left to me by my deceased mother and father. Among the records were 33's from the 60's 70's and 80's and 78's from the 50'ss and older. The girls were completely amazed with the ""giant CD's"". When they wanted to hear them I no longer had anything to play them on. As I told them things about the Artists I knew and the times I had grown up in we found most songs on the internet so they could hear the records they were cataloging. How thrilled they were to hear the long  ago songs and the voices of the dead that will forever live. I had offered to pay them for the hours of work they were doing to help me on the project and instead they wanted this  record player and a few of the Albums. I was all too happy to oblige them. It arrived in perfect shape and on time. The kids were so excited to hear the first album played...It was the Sound of Music. It has continued to work well. Note..On newer Albums purchased today the ""Vinyl"" is a little different and you may need to put a coin on the tone arm to make it a little heavier so it doesn't skip. There has been no trouble at all with the olderalbums.

  I bought this for my mother-in-law who is stubborn on having an all in one system. This is hands down the biggest joke for playing records I have ever experienced.I have turntables that range from cheap 80’s plastic, to Ion ittusb, vintage 70’s high end, a music hall mmf2.2 and a $1500 pro-ject. I have cartridges that run cheap to expensive. Same with speakers and amplifier. I’m not a snob. I love music and I know how to reproduce vinyl at all price points. With that, this record player is horrendous.The sound either through it’s built in speakers or connected to a home stereo is weak and empty. There is no bottom end, clarity or separation. Someone stated in a review that the speakers on their phone has better sound. Hands down absolutely true.Lepai amp $28, Dayton audio B652 speakers $28, Audio-Technica At-lp60 $99. $160 and you smoke the hell out this cheap crap.If you are playing records that cost almost as much as this crap table and say, we’ll its good enough for me, then so is a booger sandwich. You are bastardizing music, what the artist intended for you to hear and are just plain cheap and ignorant. Do us all a favor, stop listening to music and hum or pick up whistling.

  This thing skips over the most minor dust particles and it’s really really annoying, especially considering you can’t close it with the record inside which means while you play the record more dust or hair has a chance of falling on it and makes it skip a ton. I’ve wiped every record down before playing and they still skip if there’s even one hint of dust. The bluetooth part is nice but definitely not worth the price if you’re trying to just play records. Complete waste of money.

  I haven't had a record player in about 30 years, so I was looking forward to digging my old vinyl out of the closet without spending a ton of money on an expensive player. I'm not so disappointed in this one that I intend to return it, but it does leave a lot to be desired.Likes: The sound quality is very good considering the price and considering that it has tiny speakers. The whole player is smaller than I thought it would be. It's very compact, and it plays my records well. The rotation on my unit is smooth, not wobbly as others have reported.Dislikes: There are two modes of powering on the turntable. In the first, the turntable comes on whenever the stylus is moved from its holder toward the edge of the record. Unfortunately, in that mode, the table is supposed to turn off when the record is finished playing. My unit turns off with about 30 seconds of music left -- extremely annoying. Imagine pulling the power cord out of the wall and hearing the music slooow down and stop.In the second mode, the table keeps turning no matter what. That means you can't walk off and forget it with a record playing, or you'll come back to a worn-out needle.I guess I was expecting the type of record player we had back before compact disks -- one that would mechanically return the stylus to its holder when the record finished. No such luck, and I'm disappointed that I have to pay so much attention to turning the unit on and off. Oh, well, you get what you pay for. At least I have something to play my records on, even if I do have to get up at the end of each 45 and fiddle with the player.

  I ordered one of these players. When it came the UPS box was fine, but the Victrola box inside had a huge hole in it. However the packaging inside the Victrola box looked okay so I went with it. At first every record I played skipped. This was my first record player so I thought it was the records and not the player that was the problem. There were tears, I was so heartbroken. The player came with an extra needle, so after every record constantly skipped I tried the other needle. That helped, but the records still skipped some of the time. I finally taped a penny to the top of the arm where the needle was and the records stopped skipping. But I thought the record player shouldn't need all of these changes to work right, so I asked for a replacement from Amazon. Worst case scenario, I'd send the new one back and live with my ""penny player"". The new player came in a different box, no damage to the box. The new player works perfectly. No new needle needed, no pennies either. And every record plays perfectly now with no skipping. The second player is a nice one, easy to use and understand and the sound is excellent. I find myself listening to records all of the time now, and can see myself falling down the vinyl rabbit hole. I look forward someday to having a corner of my home with a beautiful sound system in it including a record player. I registered my first player (the damaged one) with Victrola, and they sent me a free needle as a welcome gift. That was nice. They seem like a quality company. First record player aside, I give the product four stars. I'm happy with it.

  Growing up, my family acquired a pretty hefty cache of LPs. Aside from the usual arsenal everyone acquired in the 70s and early-mid 80s, at one point, my elementary school closed down, and the principal decided to give away the entire music library of the school (considerable) to anyone who wanted it. For no reason other than the sheer joy of taking something from the school, I hauled away armload after armload of records which have sat in my mom's basement for about 40 years, well preserved but also unlistened-to. A few weeks ago I was on the phone with her and she lamented the fact she no longer had a record-player, because she had a yen to listen to old records. I immediately went into Amazon and had this player sent to her house. I am pleased to announce she loves it. She loves the bright color of the case, loves that it is portable and can be played anywhere in the house (unlike the hefty systems of the past), and tells me the sound quality is quite good. She even noted that it reminds he strongly of the players she herself grew up with, so there's a nostalgia factor.All in all I think that this was a great buy. I haven't yet had a chance to try it out for myself but moms was happy and since she spent the first 40-odd years of her life listening to LPs and 45s, I think her standards have to be respected. I will add a report of my own the next time I visit, but for now I give this five stars. It does the job it is supposed to do, and for a very reasonable price.

  If you're looking to play records and don't particularly care too much for good sound quality, then this turntable is for you. Don't let self-proclaimed turntable 'experts' steer you away from this novelty purchase, or make you feel bad for already owning one. This is a perfect novelty record player that plenty of newcomers can enjoy to start off their journey into this side of the music world. In the end, records are meant to be played. Enjoy them while you can.My recommendations:-Purchase a diamond needle to replace the stock one it comes with. Don't worry, it's easily replaceable. The needle it comes with is very low-quality and has a high chance to skip and sound 'hissy'.-If you plan on wanting good sound out of this thing, purchase some powered speakers. That partially ruins the 'portability' gimmick, but not by much.How's it feel?-It feels well constructed. It doesn't feel luxurious, mind you, but it also doesn't feel extremely cheap.How's the setup?-Easy. It's all set up and good to go, right out of the box. Practically plug-and-play.Hows the sound quality?-Bad. Lol. It's very 'tinny' and lacks depth. Bass is imperceptible. Mids and highs sound okay. The same can be said no matter if you're using the speakers or the headphone output. That's what should be expected at this price range. It can get very loud however, which is a good thing. It can fill a medium room with its loudness.How's the bluetooth?-Fine. Works as it should. Easy to connect. No problems so far.How's the portability?Good. It's got the body of a suitcase! Perfectly portable in that regard. One complaint I have however, is the fact that it doesn't have some sort of battery it runs off of. It *needs* to be plugged in. So its portability is only useful if you've got an outlet to plug it into.

    Stylus Skips / Terrible Customer Support / Nice Tie Dye Finish
  
",2.0 ,4Papa,"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2021","









  
  
    
  Bought 4 months ago as birthday gift for daughter. Nice style and design.  Some of my old LP's played, other's didn't.  I figured the records were old and scratched.  Fast forward to December.  Daughter received a few new vinyl records for Xmas and two wouldn't play without skipping.  Again, these are BRAND NEW records.  I tried the same LP's on my vintage player and they played perfectly.  I assume the included stylus (needle) is too crude to play the records properly.  I've tried to contact Victrola via both email and telephone and have received no answer.Two stars is generous for this player and the company.  I'm giving it 0 stars for customer service, 0 for playability and 5 stars for the Tie Dye finish.

    Alright record player, solid Bluetooth speaker
  
",4.0 ,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this refurbished by the seller, which came out to be essentially like new. The sound quality on the phonograph is alright. It plays records in a lofi sound quality, but it's still perfectly fine listening to it. If you're into listening to your records in the highest quality possible, you already aren't looking to buy this. This product is aimed at people who simply want to have an inexpensive way to listen to records, or even to get into the hobby.The build quality is alright. I'm not taking it traveling, so I'm not to worried about it holding up to force. Mine was pretty tough to get to the insides for tinkering. I had to take a razor blade to split the seams enough to lift the wooden panel up. The tonearm on mine came down pretty fast, which threw me off since the same model I replaced with this had its tonearm take a comfortably slow lowering to records. I had to add Elmer's glue to the tonearm mechanism to get it to ease on the speed, and now it falls much softer.What really surprised me about this player was the Bluetooth functionality. It's an okay phonograph, but a surprisingly amazing sounding Bluetooth speaker. With the lid closed, I was shocked how good music sounded from its built in speakers. The speakers don't really do records justice, but with Spotify and YouTube connected to it through it from my phone, it's a full, high quality sound. The size of the entire case really helps give it that quality sound. When the lid is opened, it still sound fine, but not as good as it is closed.I paid around $20 for mine, and at that price I think it's fair. Don't pay much more for it though, you can get better players than this.

  Bought this record player for my bedroom as my current record player is being used by a friend. Product arrived without a power cord and damaged (hinge for the front of the case wouldn't close and then proceeded to fall off). While I was annoyed it didn't come with a power cable it wasn't a big deal as I have plenty of others around that I could use. As soon as I plugged it in, a popping noise took place and then SMOKE started pouring out of the headphone jack and bottom of the case. Player is adorable but DO NOT PURCHASE.

  My most recent purchase was the second player I had ordered. The first player did not work straight out of the box. No phono, no line-in, no Bluetooth, no sound. Nothing. I purchased another one and it actually played for about 30 minutes before it stopped working too. I thought it had perhaps come with a faulty AC adapter but I tried another one and still, nothing.Wait. I thought I heard some static coming from those speakers! Great! Nope. Never mind. It stopped working again. Ugh.I love the look and the portability but I am a bit of a utilitarian. I don’t want to carry around a neat little box for no discernible reason. It needs to have some sort of function and unfortunately it’s not heavy enough to use as a door stop.

    Skips on brand new vinyls. JUST DON’T DO IT
  
",1.0 ,Travis,"Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I’ve been an amazon prime customer for around 8 or so years. Maybe even 10. I’ve never returned something before, until now. This thing is utter garbage. I’m new to the vinyl scene, and thought this would be a good entry-level buy. I was wrong. I got it yesterday, but didn’t have any vinyls yet, 2 of which arrived today.The vinyls I received are brand new. Not used. They have no scratches. I cleaned them beforehand. Pop one in and first thing I notice is it’s constantly slipping. One of the albums I ordered is a 3 disc vinyl, the other a one disc. I tried all four discs to make sure it wasn’t the vinyl records themselves, it wasn’t. They all were skipping constantly. Frustrated I turned to google. After some investigating I found out this is a common problem with this turntable. I read it you continue to use it it will lead to the needle actually scratching and permanently destroying your vinyls and possibly even warp them.To say I’m beyond disappoint is an understatement. I’m really hoping the my vinyls aren’t damaged already. I ordered another turntable, but it won’t arrive until Thursday due to Coronavirus and the extended delivery times for nonessential items. Guess I’ll find out then if the vinyls were permanently damaged by this poorly conceived product.In the end, imo, it’s worth paying the extra fifty to a hundred bucks to get a better low end entry level beginner turntable. When it comes to this monstrosity—JUST DON’T DO IT. It’s not worth the gamble.

",3.0 ,B. Robinson,"Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  Out of the box, this record player was limited in the records it could play. I attempted to play records by Amy Winehouse, Radiohead, and Ariana Grande, but all of them skipped horribly. I was able to play a few classic albums (Sgt Pepper's Lonely Heart Band and Kind of Blue) as well as an album by a now defunct local band. When looking through reviews, I found that some people had to replace the needle to something higher quality than the one that comes with the player and that fixed the issues. I ordered some new tips and now the records are all playing without skipping. They are pretty easy to replace. The sound quality from the player is horrible, but i expected that and i have been using my own speaker. The playback is dynamic though at times it distorts a tiny but with some records, especially at louder parts. It really is only a tiny but distorted,  if I were an audiophile I would probably hate it but it's not enough to bother an amateur like myself.  But honestly I got what I expected:  a cute but practical decoration that would hold me off as far as records go until I can find a higher quality player that adds to my home's aesthetic.As far as appearance goes, I got the light blue player and it looks exactly like it did in the picture. It is a cute addition to my home office that helps the space feel more relaxing and provides a nice color pop to the room.

  This little record player is fantastic and has returned me to the joys of collecting and playing vinyl LPs. It is sturdy, has a small footprint and very simple to use. Highly portable but I have mine in one place and have connected  nicer speakers via the RCA jacks on the back. It comes with pretty good dynamic range speakers built into the cabinet but you are not going to get the full sounds that you probably want unless you hook up other speakers and a sub woofer. I bought the Logictec Z323 system for mine and I now feel like I have the best stereo system I could ever want. Rich, warm sound and thanks to the huge number of cheap, old LPs out there, I have access to music that either never made it to CDs or is too expensive.

  This 3 Speed Victrola portable record player arrived in a box that was not taped shut. That was my first clue that this could to be a ""return"" that got sent out as good merchandise. I hope! When I opened the box the power supply cord was tossed loosely on top of the player with the twist tie undone, the cord was not even nicely wrapped up! I took the player out of the box and removed the Styrofoam protectors and undid the latch and open the player to discover that the plastic needle protector that was so suppose to be on the needle (to be removed before playing a record) was missing, another clued that this could be a return that got passed on to me! Then I discovered that the drive belt was lose and hanging out from beneath the turntable! Okay, I figured that I could reattach it around the turntable and then around the drive shaft and I did so and was successful. Next I connected the power supply and turned the power knob, the turntable spun! So I obtained one of my old LP's and placed it on the turntable and settled the needle down gently upon it (using the needle arm control) and the record started off fine, the sound was perfect and then the sound stopped! I turned the player off and then turned it on again, still no sound coming from the speakers. Well, I'm not that disappointed because anytime you purchase electronics from Amazon, it's going to be a gamble. So, I will be returning this item as usual.

  I’ve only had this item for about an hour and a half and I’m not satisfied. I watched some other photo reviews and the sound seemed so much better. But now that it’s here in person, the sound quality isn’t all that great. Now it’s not TERRIBLE - but let’s just say my crappy iPhone speaker sounds better. The bass isn’t captured well. The item itself is a tad flimsy on the inside. Don’t push or pull anything too hard or it will probably break. As far as the look - it’s lovely. If this is something you’re buying for decoration, then it’s probably a good fit. The color is nice and the record player buckles up well. I don’t use headphones but there is also an AUX and headphone jack in case you want to connect it to other speakers or your headphones. But honestly, I bought this thing in hopes it could make it’s own decent sound. So I will be asking for a return as the quality of sound and music is not good. Also, the speed goes up and down during the songs. So it will play super fast and then super slow randomly. 🙄

Quite a pain and other reviewers also had short lifespans.As for the product itself in the 29 days I had it, it is easy to use. Sound is good for the price.

    Great Value, But Tinny Speakers & Needle Skips

  I ordered this as I've had a much larger, higher-quality RCA cabinet in the past that my dad sold out from under me. Finally was able to get back into vinyl after years of wanting too, so I picked this little player up as a good starter. Victrola has always been a bit of a budget player, so this fits their usual build.It's very much a basic, starter player. It does have Bluetooth, which is a nice feature. The headphone and line in/out with RCA hookups were a nice touch. Once I finally manage to find the same cabinet I had before, I'll likely move on from this one. But it makes a decent bookshelf player. The speakers are tinny, but aren't awful for their size. Would recommend Singing Wood speakers with RCA if you're on a budget, and RCA vintage wood housed speakers if you're willing to do some leg work and Edifier/Bose if you have enough to shell out. Even with the tinny speakers; it still flat out beats MP3 quality.For some reason, the player works just fine with all of my LPs, except for my new copy of David Bowie's ""No Plan."" I checked and the vinyl is pressed flat, not any thicker or thinner than Bon Iver, Flogging Molly, etc. Taped two pennies to the top of the needle for a little extra weight and that did the trick. Otherwise, without the additional weight ""No Plan"" keeps skipping.Purchased some additional replacement needles and will grab a cleaning kit in a bit. Works like a dream with the wooden over-ear Victrola Bluetooth headphones. Would recommend using them with their headphone jack if you want the best sound quality.

  Bought this as my very first Vinyl Record Player Experience. I guess that I just expected too much for the price.The build of the item itself is plastic, so it is lightweight, as expected and is rather convenient for portability. The tonearm and needle are rather flimsy and the plate that you lay the records on is also made of a cheap plastic.I did however expect it to work with integrated or removable batteries, considering that it does have a suitcase form factor to allow it to be more portable. You are forced to use the included power supply.Now regarding to the main functions of the device: The Included Speakers are BAD, and I mean really bad. There is no depth in them, whatsoever and the overall distortion makes it impossible to enjoy.The player suffered from frequent skipping, which initially seemed to be the LP's fault, but after playing back a few more records, it became clear that the tonearm and needle are too light to apply the needed force to avoid such a problem. I stopped using this product immediately after realizing this.To set the icing on the cake, it died on me a few weeks ago... I guess I'll be switching to Sony's newest PS-LX310BT Belt Drive Turntable that is much better built and has a great minimalist design. They're pros when it comes to the good old Record Players and Vinyls!RESUMED: Save up some more cash and go with something that cost $200 or more. Anything else just isn't worth it.

  Absolutely disgusted, and disappointed.  I have purchased other “modern” record players, and found there to be poor quality sound, and even worse components.  Yet I had hoped that a record player with the name of “Victrola” behind it-  an absolutely  legendary name , in the phonograph industry-  would be the exception....  My hopes are for naught.  The speakers are horrific, and the 78 speed is too fast, and something that is all too common in electronic devices-  the headphone jack does not work properly.  If I had a dollar for every time this had happened when I have purchased electronics with headphone jacks, I could put myself through school and learn in-depth electronics, and create my own jacks, that actually work.  Do not purchase this record player, or any other modern (lower price) record player- especially the “retro” looking nostalgia types.  They are junk.  I want my money back “Victrola”.

  This is not the highest quality record player you can buy, but it's still real good. This is a nice, inexpensive little turntable that is more than enough for those of us with small home collection of vinyl albums. I chose pink because it was the cheapest color at the time of purchase. It has built-in speakers, which was a requirement for me. But it also has an output so that you can play it through external speakers. This can't be connected to computer like some record players, but it is portable and very nice looking. It has three speeds and it will automatically stop playing once it reaches the end of a record, which is really, really nice. The built-in speakers aren't the greatest quality, and they don't get as loud as I'd like, but they're still good and more than acceptable. It comes with a back-up replacement needle, which is really cool. The biggest complaint is that the record hangs off the side, and it's designed in a way that you can't directly place the record onto the player. If you tried to place it directly down, it would bump into the needle arm. So when you place records on the player, you have to kind of angle it to go underneath the needle arm. But this is just a minor inconvenience at most. I would still recommend this player as it is great quality and relatively inexpensive.

   It’s much lighter than I expected, but it was packed in plastic bags and styrofoam so it was well protected in the box. Everything has a nice feel to it meaning it doesn’t feel cheap and the lid is lined with “velvet” and the “Victrola” is raised...nice little touch. I was a little surprised it wasn’t in a cardboard shipping box as it was just the regular manufacturer’s box like you’d buy it in at a store. However, it was in perfect condition. It set up and ran very easy. The only thing I’d change is better speakers, but they’re as good as I expect for this price and I planned on using Bluetooth speakers anyway. I’d also change the auto stop function so that the arm returns to the stand, but at least it has auto stop so you can be doing other things while listening to your music and not worry about the needle bumping the label repeatedly until you can get to it. I love the look and it works great. I think it’s a great deal for less than $50.

  Sound is fine. No issues. Portability is not great. It requires a plug in and no where to carry it. Dumb. My main issue... the genius design team decided the flag should be upside down when carrying and playing. Fail. Thanks, but no thanks. Research what the American flag distress signal is Victrola. It doesn't go on your music box.

   First off before I write this review let me just say I did a lot of research on this kind of record player and even a few of my own experiments so i would consider what i found to be pretty credible. I wish someone wrote a review like this for me when I was considering buying it.#1 Is this a good record player for beginners or people who only want a few records to play for the aesthetic? Absolutely. The sound quality is meh, but I mean what do you expect for $40. It plays the records no problems, and the bluetooth is great for just whenever.Now here is how you can upgrade your setup with minimal spending. Get an RCA to mini jack cable. Plug that into a speaker you already have or if in my case you have a practice amp cause you play an instrument, get a mini jack to 1/4 converter and plug it into the amp! It works great!#2 Will this ruin my records?No. It will not. I made a little scale and using pennies weighed out the tracking force to be around 5g. Now compared to $200 record players that track at 3g this seems like a lot. But be aware, when records were made, they were made to withstand up to 7 or 8g of tracking force cause lots of old players tracked at around 5 or 6g. Now tracking heavier like this will yes, wear them out faster, but it will NOT ruin them! The needle is also a diamond, so the needle is pretty decent actually.Now you can actually fix the tracking force on this thing. Get a small scale, like the kind to bake with, put your tone arm on it, get some pennies and nickels and start stacking them at the back of the tone are where the counterweight should be. One your tone arm reads at about 3.5-4g. Take those coins, tape them together, and tape them to the back of that tone arm. Maybe even go for around 4-4.5g because in my experience these cheap ones skip very easily.#3 Is it portable?Absolutely not. You need to plug it into an outlet, and it could totally break with some throwing around. Also the lid is completely useless.I took the lid off by unscrewing the screws on the back hinges. The lid is NOT big enough even when open to run 12"" vinyls. The edge is right under your record, like millimeters under, and if you have ANY warping, at all it will hit the edge and cause it to skip. This is likely the problem a lot of people have when it skips and just don't know it. Just take the lid off its useless.#4 Does it skip? Does it sound weird?No, not at all. I had it skip on me once, and after replaying that section it never did it again. Probably was just my fault since i accidentally tapped the vinyl I was playing when getting it out of the sleeve. Also I tested the wow and flutter using a phone app. Let me tell you that it is BAD, like the wow and flutter is REALLY HIGH. But, even so, I didnt notice ANY sort of distortion in the sound. It might be worse when playing above 33rpm but at least for 33, its fine.#5 Is it worth the price?100% as long as you know what your getting. I didn't expect this player to be good or even great. Its okay at best and I'm fine with that cause its $40. If you are looking for a very nice player that delivers great sound quality, dont get this. If you want to really get into vinyl, dont get this. If you want to experience the most you can from your records, dont get this. If you want to just play a couple of records for cheap and have them in your room cause its cool and aesthetic, go ahead, im doin it for that exact reason.(Also, I purchased an amazon return and found no problems with it. Dont be afraid to purchase a used one for less, you can always return it if it is actually broken, but it will probably work anyway)

  I am so pissed off about this record player...I was sooo excited and wanted to jam out my old records...and I did..1 day...I didn't use the record player for about a month after that cause I went on vacation and forgot about it...but when I got back..I was pumped to listen to tunes....so..i went to go play a record...and (I swear!) I smelled smoke!! And ...it didn't work at all...the little light didn't even come on!! I mean...I didn't even move it from it's spot at all...it had been too late to return it...I never write reviews good or bad really..but heads up on this one...it really made me sad it didn't work after 1 time....boo to the manufacturer...boo!
