  I use this about once a week if I remember. Absolutely love this! My hair feels smooth and moisturized after using this product.  You do not need to use a lot of the product and lasts for quite awhile. Just know that it is a small bottle. You can make it last as long or as short as you want depending on the amount and how often you use it.

  Love using olaplex, it has really helped my damaged hair get back on track.  I've bought this product direct from Olaplex and also from Amazon.  I notice that the amazon version is much thinner than the one purchase direct.  They both seem to work but it makes me wonder if the formulation is different or diluted on Amazon.

  I have had dry, wild, frizzy, thick but fine- stranded hair my whole life. It breaks if you look at It very hard. I straighten it with a hair dryer and it becomes a broken straw broom. I have used “repair” products on my hair for decades with a “yeah whatever” attitude. So I bought this other “repair” product expecting more of the same, except maybe a bit softer. IT WORKS. It is literally the only thing I’ve ever used that made a difference. I don’t understand how and I don’t know what kind of hair wizardry it uses, but it literally stops my hair from breaking. I even (gasp) bleached some of my hair and it is not damaged!!! Where was this product when I was a dork  in middle school with hair so wild I couldn’t fit through doors? Thank you to whatever hair god figured this out!

  This product is amazing! I purchased this for my daughter (and used along with No. 4 Shampoo and No. 5 Conditioner) who's hair was extremely damaged from a salon visit. She had her hair bleached 3 times in 24 hrs (2 differ hair appts) in order to lighten her medium brown hair to (almost) platinum blonde so that she could achieve pastel pink hair color. Unfortunately, the hair dresser had no idea what she was doing, which resulted in straw like texture and uneven color  (not extreme breakage yet, but wanted to prevent further damage).  After 1 use of all these products (No. 3/4/5), her hair was transformed!!! It was soft and was visibly healthy.  We left No. 3 treatment on for 2hrs. and followed up with No.4/5. We did a 2nd treatment with all three products a few days later, leaving No. 3 treatment on for 4hrs and followed up with No. 4/5. Again, so soft and healthy looking. We will continue treatment 2x/week to keep it strong and to prevent breakage. The smell is clean and light - for all 3 products.

  This is literally worthless. Iv used this multiple times in my hair, my sister's hair, and my cousin. My hairstylist even used this and same the same thing. Those product is either a scam or a faulty bottle, because real olaplex has always worked. But yet this bottle didn't work on not only me, but 3 other individuals as well.

    Real vs. Fake Controversy
  
",4.0,G. LaJoie,"Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2018","









  
  
    
  There are a number of reviews here claiming that the product purchased through Amazon is fake...to find out if this is true, I purchased one bottle here on Amazon and one directly from the Olaplex website (the product price is the same, but I saved $5 here on shipping because I am a Prime member)...I compared the two on appearance of packaging and product and on performance. Verdict: identical. The stuff ordered through Amazon is NOT fake. That said, it's expensive either way, and not a miracle worker,  but if you have damaged hair it's worth a try-- I have babyfine processed hair so I will continue to use it-- and I will buy it confidently through Amazon.

  This product came as advertised.  Same as the one I had from Sephora (I had read some reviews on here that it wasn't the same).  I have fine texture, shoulder length color treated hair.  This product is quite simple to use, you just totally wet your hair and towel dry it (you don't want it dripping) , apply the product throughout (I use approx 1/4 of contents for an application, a little pricey but I want to take good care of my hair).  Afterward I put a clear shower cap over my hair and do whatever about the house or catch up on some TV shows. It says to leave on for at least 10 mins, I leave in  my hair for 1-2 hours (I want to reap as much benefits of the product as I can). Afterward rinse it all out and shampoo, condition , blow dry and style as usual.  I find it makes my hair silkier, shinier and gives it body and bounce.  My hair has the I just left the salon feel after using this product.  I really like that is doesn't have a strong scent, I would describe it as pleasant but very mild.  I just snapped a pic of the back of my hair with my phone so you can see for yourself.

  The hair perfector really does live up to all the hype. I had absolutely destroyed my hair from bleaching it, and nothing was helping. Finally, I tried Olaplex No. 3 and it literally repaired my hair. I put it all through my damp hair, leave it in overnight, sometimes for 24 hours, and the results are INCREDIBLE! You feel the difference immediately when you rinse it out in the shower. I cannot recommend this enough, as well as their Bonding Smoother. I can't wait to try more of Olaplex's products!

  I’ve seen several people say “This isn’t a fake, I compared the real one to Amazon’s and they look exactly the same.” If people ACTUALLY did that, they would notice that the ingredients list from Olaplex’s site compared to Amazon’s “Olaplex’s No 3” IS VERY DIFFERENT. I didn’t realize this (because of the 50,000+ reviews with an average of 4.5 stars, I just purchased it without comparing first) at first. Then I used it and it didn’t live up to the hype. So I did some digging.Olaplex’s Site Ingredients List:Water, Bis-Aminopropyl Diglycol Dimaleate, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetyl Alcohol, Phenoxyethanol, Glycerin, Hydroxyethyl Ethylcellulose, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Quaternium-91, Sodium Benzoate, Cetrimonium Methosulfate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance, Polyquaternium-37, Tetrasodium EDTA, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Etidronic Acid, Ascorbic Acid, Phytantriol, Tocopheryl Acetate, Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Panthenol, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Citric Acid, Potassium Sorbate.Amazon’s “Olaplex No 3 Ingredients List:Water, Bis-Aminopropyl Digycol Dimaleate, Propylene Glycol, Cetearyl Alcohol, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Ascorbic Acid (Vitamin C), Tocopheryl Acetate (Vitamin E), Retinol Palmitate (Vitamin A), Aloe Barbadensis Leaf Juice, Phytantriol, Panthenol, Simmondsia Chinensis (Jojoba) Seed Oil, Hydrolyzed Wheat Protein, Wheat Amino Acids, Behentrimonium Methosulfate, Cetyl Alcohol, Glycerin, Stearamidopropyl Dimethylamine, Hydroxyethyl Ethylcellulose, Quaternium-91, Cetrimonium Methosulfate, Cetrimonium Chloride, Fragrance (Parfum), Polyquaternium-37, Tetrasodium EDTA, Magnesium Nitrate, Butylphenyl Methylpropional, Methylchloroisothiazolinone, Magnesium Chloride, Methylisothiazolinone, Etidronic Acid, Potassium Sorbate, Phenoxyethanol, Citric Acid, Disodium EDTA, Sodium Benzoate, Prunus Amygdalus Dulcis (Sweet Almond) Oil.The ingredients list isn’t even close to the same.

  This product truly helped save my hair. My stylist always dyes me a level 1 cool blue black, and I was ready for a change and thought lockup was perfect time to lighten my hair since nobody would see me. Well...lifting black is no easy feat, and I used a 40 vol quick blue double process and my hair was beyond fried. The frizzy photo shows how bad-this was after I cut about 6 inches off too! So many tears I was hysterical. I googled, and ordered this and used once a week overnight, in conjunction with the Matrix 1&2 bonding shampoo and conditioner. Just got back to my hair stylist about 3 weeks later (pic 2/3) and we did a roof shadow and a toner to smooth her out. My hair is still trash because it’s so short, but omg this seriously is amazing! I was at a point that I didn’t think I could come back from with the structure of my hair-it was like wet goo that never dried! Three weeks of religious use 1-2 times a week will BRING YOU BACK! You need this. It’s actually amazing!

  I bought Olaplex no 3 from Amazon a few years ago and it was alright. I probably washed it off too early.Since I bleached my hair recently, I wanted to get hair treatment products such as this to prevent further damage.I bought it from Amazon again and let it sit on my hair for good 30min (few days before bleaching, bottom half had some bleached and dyed hair). I think it made my hair a little softer but not a miraculous result.I'll be using this more often on my bleached hair and come back to update my review.By the way, I saw so many reviews saying that this is not authentic here on Amazon and so I ordered the same thing from Sephora to see the consistency and the packaging. The only difference (very subtle) I see is that:the label sticker on Olaplex no 3 from Amazon is not smooth and has that vertical fold/crack going down caused by the bottle shape beneath it. The bottle from Sephora looks exactly the same and the code is the same on the Amazon one but the sticker label on the Sephora one is smooth.I looked in close on both bottles and the Amazon's bottle is not completely smoothed out where the halves (the bottle is plastic and it's obviously made from sticking two halves together) meet are not sanded smoothly so the vertical center line sticking out causes the sticker to crease.The one from SEPHORA though also has that verticle line in the center but it looks like it's smoothed out really well or something so while you can see the line, the surface is really smooth = no crease on the label sticker.Other than that, the consistency of the product, the fragrance, the stickers, prints, fonts, quality are exactly the same.I think it's important to get these from Amazon and make sure it's not sent from other sellers.

  Let me start by saying this thing is a miracle worker! I've been hearing about this for years but never had a damaging chemical process that I'd need to use it, until now. I decided to dye my hair blue, it's something I have been wanting to do for years but didn't want to bleach my full head, I have reddish brown hair, a medium to dark brown, that I dye with permanent hair color, so I bleached my entire head with 40 volume peroxide and bleach powder, luckily my hair bleached easily to a very pale blonde that I didn't need to bleach again, but that first round destroyed my curly hair. I have loose curls/waves and my hair looked like brillo when it was dry. I was so nervous, I couldn't comb through, it was elastic, it was a mess. I then dyed it using Arctic fox hair dye which is vegan, no chemicals and moisturizes the hair. My hair then looked great color wise, it was soft but looked fried, and I mean fried!!! That was Last Monday, so I spent the week doing loads of Argan oil, had to flat iron it to help hide the extreme damage, but still the ends would look super dry and pretty much like brillo, and we had the worst week in NYC, hot and very humid, which didn't help at all. So I decided to buy this, was skeptical about the ""Fake"" reviews, so I bought directly from amazon and not third party sellers, just to be extra sure. I received the product sealed, looking fine. The consistency is thick, its very concentrated. I washed my hair with sulfate free shampoo to remove all the Argan oil i used and then put Olaplex all over my hair, combed, put a shower cap and let it stay for 2 hours. Then rinsed, shampooed and put a ""It's a 10"" hair mask for about 10 minutes and massaged it on my hair. And wow, just wow, my hair felt like hair again, I was able to blow dry it straight with a comb, and NO and I mean Not a single hair got stuck or broke off on the brush! My hair is back to life! It's soft, shiny, super strong and  I""m so happy again!!! This pic is from a couple of hours after I used it and you can see it looks like hair and not a steel sponge!

  Have you ever gotten a hair product and hoped it would be the best remedy for your split ends and damaged hair? After buying so many hair products, it was hopeless to rescue my damaged hair, until I found Olaplex No. 3. This product is a great hair treatment product for men and women with damaged hair. This creation helps strengthen hair by repairing and healing each individual hair shaft with less noticeable split ends. This product has quick results and after 2-3 washes, your hair is noticeably healthier and stronger. It is also leaves your hair very shiny and soft with the amount of hydration it gives. Many celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Drew Barrymore, and Chrissy Teigen use this product and describe it as a “game changer”. Although the quality of this product is very good, it is not cheap considering how much product you’re getting. This product will help your split ends as well as relieve its thirstiness.Many people might say, “Well is it a popular brand?”, it sure is! Many famous celebrities such as Kim Kardashian, Drew Barrymore, and Chrissy Teigen swear by this product. KKW Beauty owner, Kim Kardashian, says, “When your hair is really damaged, if you sleep in that, it really works. I notice a huge difference!” Kim Kardashian has gone from brunette to platinum blonde hair and expresses confidence in this product. Drew Barrymore has her own beauty company and she also uses this merchandise. She says, “And so quickly my hair is remarkably and clearly better. It's curling and actually bouncing and looking like hair rather than coughed up bird feathers….” She clearly states that she values this product because of how it leaves her hair looking. Chrissy Teigen is a firm believer in it since she colours her hair very often and says that it’s a “miracle worker”. Although many people may assume that celebrities are getting paid to say this product is good, other review of this product certainly shows that it is definitely worth buying!Olaplex No. 3 helped me rescue my damaged hair with split ends. It is a concentrated at-home treatment that contains the same ingredients found in all professional salon products. It will fix split ends by relinking the broken disulfide bonds caused by chemical, thermal, and mechanical damage to the hair. This formula is made to work with various types of hair while reducing breakage and improving its look and feel. This treatment links broken bonds in the hair before, during, and after chemical treatment. This means your hair is actually being repaired and not just temporarily hydrated by using various types of oils with no parabens, sulfates, and phthalates, which are dangerous chemicals. This product not only brings life to your hair, but repairs it, which is why many people should buy this product.Although this product is astonishing, it can be a little high-priced for the amount of product provided. When purchasing this product, 100mL is provided for $28. The reason that only 100mL is provided is because only a generous amount of this product is needed to coat hair in one treatment; no matter the length of hair. Only a small amount is needed to leave hair looking healthy. Compared to other treatments, this product is considered over-priced, but it is considered phenomenal. This treatment is definitely an investment for hair considering the price.Olaplex No. 3 is the perfect hair treatment product for men and women with impaired hair. Now, one might say, “Why should I use this product?”, well, this product strengthens hair like no other treatment, while not only leaving hair with less visible split ends, but also repairing them. The effect of this product is impeccable with only 2-3 washes to produce healthy and hydrated hair. Many celebrities are advocates for this product such as Kim Kardashian, Drew Barrymore, and Chrissy Teigen. After constantly putting chemicals in my hair, this hair mask rescued my damaged hair by bringing my natural curly hair to life through a series of treatments. This product is an investment for hair and everyone with damaged hair should use it.

  After the first treatment my fine, thin, dry, color-treated, damaged hair feels soft, smoother, and maybe even a little thicker. I left it in overnight and I feel like I’m still seeing the effects develop several days later.

  I have long gray hair which is normally dry and looks like hay.  I've never really used anything beyond just regular shampoo and conditioner. I left this product on for 15-20 minutes, washed it out, shampooed and applied my conditioner.  Then worked in some Argan oil while hair was damp.  I have to say, my hair has never been better.  It is flaxen and looks very healthy even down to the scalp.  Scalp even looks better.  I love this stuff.  Small bottle and expensive... but worth it.

  I lightened my hair a couple times trying to even the color and my hair (long, just under shoulder blades) got gummy and too watery/porous; Olaplex no. 3 helped to repair some of those bonds and reduce the gummy texture and help my hair dry normally and 'heal' from the lightening. Best case, Olaplex should be used before the damage is done to lessen it, but masking for a couple house every few days is still helpful after the fact. Any longer than a couple hours and I understand it doesn't really do anything, so no need to sleep in the product like some claim. And remember it is not a leave-in, you must wash it out.  I used this in conjunction with Aphogee.

  Olaplex was amazing. My hair is color treated and my ends had gotten very dry and brittle. After the Olaplex treatment it made my hair so much softer and shinier  And it really helped the ends of my hair. I used about 1/4 of the bottle to saturate my damp hair and left it on for 30 minutes for my first treatment.  I used the remainder of the Olaplex for shorter treatments in the shower. My hairdresser introduced me to Olaplex. She was 100% right.

  I recently started beaching my hair, and noticed immediately that my hair now has lots of frizzies.  I tried the most popular frizz products on Amazon to take care of that problem, and was disappointed to find that none of them worked properly.I had used Olaplex No 3 in the past and loved it, so I tried it again.  Am so glad it works pretty well on frizzies caused by bleaching.  I use an amount of the product that will make my hair lay down without making it limp, and let it dry before combing it through with a fine tooth comb.  I use it after every shampoo and then a couple of times each week.  People compliment my hair and say it looks great.  I really highly recommend this item if you have chronic frizzies.

  I was skeptical at first because of the price and the small amount of product you get for it. However, I have shoulder length, fine, fragile, chemically processed hair, and I use this 1-2x/wk, and it has lasted several months. A little goes a long way. It has a light scent. My hairdresser keeps telling me what good shape my hair is in despite how much we dye it very light. I credit Olaplex bond builder. This is a must-have for me. It’s worth the money but you have to use it regularly to see results.

  I purchased this because a hair dresser friend of mine said it was what they recommended to their clients when they dye their hair (usually blonde). It helps bond the hairs back together to give it strength. I don't bleach my hair, but I do color it every few months. My hair was healthy when I was younger, but having a medical issues, my hair started to fall out and doesn't grow like it used to. The ends are split and it is usually semi-course. After using this just once, I could run my fingers through my hair and not feel the rough parts. It felt almost silky. I've used it about 3 times and still have half the bottle left. I cannot say if it repairs split ends (I know you cannot mend them back together), I mean more in the way of helping them not fray or split further...but I definitely recommend this product to help give life back to your hair. It's not a miracle worker, but it's definitely putting health back into my dry strands.

  If you’re on the fence about buying it like I was - but it. I bleached my naturally dark but also box dyed dark hair 5-6 times over a 4 month period and by the last time my hair was dead. It had the funny feeling when wet, took FOREVER to dry, and get stringy and gross when I ran my fingers through it. I’ve used olaplex only TWICE so far (I think I’ll be able to get 5 uses out of this bottle and I have a decent amount of hair) and it feels so much better. The first use I left in for about 4 hrs and the second I left in over night. My hair dries much faster, doesn’t feel gummy, and looks a lot more shiny. If you want an extra supplement to this or if you don’t wanna spend the money on this I’d recommend the whole total repair 5 line by L’Oréal.

  I’ve been using this product for 6 months, and it has made a noticeable difference in my hair.  My hair was very broken and would not grow due to split ends.  With slight trimming every 3 weeks and using this product 2-3 times per week for the past 6 months, the texture of my hair is really improving, and I finally am getting more length.  I leave this product in overnight.  The instructions say to wash your hair again after use, but I tend to leave it in until the next time I would have washed my hair otherwise.

Splits are a struggle for me, and in the dry winter air, I've been dealing with a ton of them, in spite of using various masks. I read a ton on Olaplex, trying to figure out if it would be right for hair that wasn't chemically damaged, as I know it is primarily used on hair that is dramatically colored. I just used it for the first time and left it on for nearly an hour, then followed with my regular shampoo and conditioner. I can barely see any split ends! I keep holding the ends up to the light, and it's like Olaplex almost cured my hair in one go. Highly, highly recommend.

  Smells really good & a little goes a long way. I’m a Caucasian female with very short, very kinky, curly hair that’s dry & frizzy. I bought all 7 products as recommended on Olaplex’s website. $168. Followed all directions carefully & was so disappointed. It did nothing for my hair & I mean nothing. I tried again using just the #3 everyone raves about, then the shampoo & conditioner. Nothing. If anything it was worse. I wanted this for so long & saved to get it. $168 wasted. Really mad at myself & I should have known better. If it sounds to good to be true....it probably is.

  Omg.....I love this stuff! My local salon charges $40.00 per treatment for Olaplex. Although this bottle is small, it's powerful. The shorter your hair is, the more use you'll get. My hair is shoulder length and I'll get probably 3 or 4 full treatments with it. I put in my first treatment overnight and my hair was much, much softer and healthier looking. I get my hair bleached every 8 to 10 weeks so I needed this.

  So I've used Olaplex in the past every time I've gotten my hair bleached. Normally, you get this product (as the third step to olaplex) from the hair dresser after your coloring session to take home.  This time I went to a new stylist and she says she used Olaplex in my color but I never received this step to take home. She actually damaged my hair so much, I was devastated. I decided to order this in hopes that it would bring it back to life. I used it 2 times each week for 2 weeks now, and wow what a difference! I am so happy I did. It is expensive, I have medium length hair and use about a quarter size of the product. Its worth it, I definitely highly recommend it.

  I have been bleaching my hair intermittently for several months to achieve and maintain a bright warm platinum blonde. The color is finally perfect but my hair was wrecked from chemical overlapping and dryness. My ends were gummy when they were wet. I used this ONCE on freshly shampooed hair, left it on towel dried for 10 minutes, rinsed, and it's like I've NEVER bleached my hair it's so healthy! Now I have the color I wanted with the shine and moisture of my virgin hair. This is so worth the money.

    The reviews about this causing fallout are true... Beware!
  
",1.0,Katherine Rice,"Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2019","









  
  
    
  My hair is pretty healthy; I endured a full set of highlights bimonthly for about 15 years, so my ends aren't fantastic, but I haven't color processed in almost a year and have been taking Nutrafol for 4 months, so the first 6-8in of my roots is about as good as it gets. I ordered this product as a Prime Day deal because I had been eyeballing it for a while with the idea that it would bring my bleach damaged ends back to life until they were finally all chopped off, and I gave it a good 3 weeks of exclusive use to see if maybe there's an adjustment period, but I'm convinced that this product is just not meant for people with fine hair (or oil glands). In the first week or so my hair started falling out waaaaaay more than usual; I would end up with a handful every time I washed (falling out from the root, not breaking off where the bleach damage was). I've had issues with excess oil since giving birth about a year and a half ago, but this made it so much worse! I wash my hair in the morning, and usually could go a day in between if I threw it up in a bun, but while using the Olaplex system I would have to put my hair up before I even left work for the day; if I had plans in the evening I would have to go home and wash my hair beforehand because it would bee too dirty to go out after an 8-10hr day, even hidden away in a clip. The No 4 shampoo and No 5 conditioner smell great, and the first few hours of the day my hair felt nice and had good body, but after lunch it's all downhill. The No 3 treatment is what caused the most fallout in my opinion, and the No 6 bond smoother leave-in made it feel tacky and tangle easily. After my month trial run I decided to switch back to my beloved patchouli CannaCell shampoo and conditioner, and I am so much happier at a quarter of the price! Now to focus on regrowing what this garbage stole from me :(

I do not know if it is the real Olaplex or not.
But I love this stuff. I started bleaching sessions since October 2018. I probably bleached 9x since. I reached to a point of extreme damage where my hair felt soo weak it would not even air dry on its own. It felt & looked like noodles & very gummy. It would take me maybe an hr to brush out my hair because of all the damage/breakage.

I started taking better care for my hair.
I stopped using 10$ shampoos & started buying quality shampoos & deep hair conditioners + hair masks + oils + oraganic virgin oils.

All these products did work for saving my hair , I did see improvement in time.

But with one use of OLAPLEX ❤
Made my hair very soft & silky + healthier looking .
I usually use a special detangling brush because of all the knots I get from breakage & from all the bleaching I've done to my hair.

With Olaplex 3 I no longer struggle to brush my hair or run my fingers without them getting stuck in my hair from tangles of dryed brittle hair.
This stuff is just what my damaged hair needed.
This was just half the bottle used on my 26inches of hair. I still have half left.

At first I was hesitant on buying because not only was it very expensive but it is a very small bottle.
I am soo glad I bought this.

  But... 1 had used my bottle twice and my hair did take to bleaching much better. Now saying that.... it didnt make my hair shiny or bouncy or moisturized as it just helps to protect the hair in between or after a bleach process. This is NOT a conditioner or miracle mask. If your hair was dry before... it will be dry afterwards that is why I would suggest (and instructions say) a deep conditioner after you wash out this formula.What I did try was the overnight process. Seemed silly. I'm a level 2 color and processed to a level 9. over the course of 4 years I have bleached and colored and removed color to add color and strip color and bleach some more, etc. I'm a bleach b. Cant help it. I'm also a 3A/B hair texture... half black and Asian. By year 4.... i had stopped going to the salon which uses olaplex 1 and 2 in my hair (which explains why I was able to bleach and dye my hair so much with barely any damage at all). ... and I would say 98% of ends are breaking off... i had cut about 4 inches of hair off and i still see i need to cut another 4!I pulled out my olaplex and said what the heck and kept it on overnight with my heating cap on. Wash it out the next day and deep conditioned.I used my regular oil and heat protectant, blow dry on cool setting and flat ironed my hair (which I stopped doing for a week) and my split ends literally looked like they disappeared! I wish I did a before and after. Much better results than just leaving it on for 10 minutes (which helped but I got an even better result leaving it on overnight). My hair looks healthy and it actually feels stronger. Yu have to personalize what you use after using this product to get the best results.Really good stuff!UPDATE: uploaded a few pictures of the changes in hair color I go through.. my hair has remained long and strong using olaplex. Its incredible how often I can change my color now.

  I have very over-processed hair and this did wonders. It is not completely healthy yet, but it’s getting there. My hair would take so long to dry since it was so damaged but I have noticed from the very first use that it’s drying much faster. I was very worried about the scent because I like my hair to smell nice but it honestly smells like generic conditioner and after shampooing and conditioning, you can’t even smell it. My only problem is how small the product is. I have very thick hair and spending over $25 for only a couple uses is not that great, however, you have to apply it on damp hair which allows you to use a lot less product and when you see how good it works, it is worth it.

   Ok let me start by saying, what happened to my hair is the horror story they give you at the salon about why NOT TO bleach your own hair at home.I had GORGEOUS hair. For reals! It was long and thick and healthy and full and big and beautiful.And it was red. Which i had dyed it consistently for a year. I decided (got a bug up my butt) i wanted to go back to my natural blonde. Que horror flick music.End result was hair so damaged i had to cut it all off including shaving off the back into an undercut to eliminate the severe damage.My goal for the last 4 months has been to avoid getting it wet, avoid washing it, and keep it moisturized at all costs!I bought this as a hail mary. My hair has reached the state of non stop breakage. Ive got 2 inch long bangs. I did not cut these hairs. They broke off. Seriously.I wasnt expecting a miracle. I just wanted to touch my hair without it breaking instantly.I got what i wanted, after one application.I can run my hands through it and its NOT BREAKING!THATS INCREDIBLE!!I plan to use it 2-3x/week as recommended for seriously damaged hair.Im very happy!& yes the bottle is small. Its 3.3 ounces. Thats small. But i have very thick hair and when you apply it to towel dried hair it spreads like crazy because its super creamy.I barely used any in my first application and i made sure it was on ALL the damage. Double the amount in front!I expect that my results will only improve with continued use.I wish i could afford the shampoo and conditioner. Alas, not this pay period! Mortgage and such! 😂😂So my suggestion is......BUY IT!

  I have platinum blonde bleached hair and I have been using this for at least a year and I will never stop. My colorist uses step one when she bleaches my roots and step 2 when she applies the toner. I use step 3 once per week. My hair is in remarkable condition considering the abuse I put it through. It doesn't feel like mush when it's wet and it doesn't look like cotton candy when it's dry which I see on a lot of bleached blondes.

  Most amazing product. I've used this for many applications including perms, bleaching, color correction and extremely damaged hair. No product works better. If used as instructed at three times per week and you have long or thick hair think about buying two or the entire treatment kit. This is a very small bottle, although it does cover a lot.If you don't get results from this product there' no product that can.

  After dying and bleaching my hair so many times while in lockdown, it was SUPER damaged. I was getting scared I was gonna have to chop it. After the first treatment with the Olaplex 3 my hair was manageable again. Very happy with the product!!I know each hair type responds differently to treatments, my hair is really fine and this worked great for me. I don’t know how it is for other hair types.

    Literally Magic

  I am blessed with incredibly resilient hair but we all need a pick me up after a bleach job! I did a home bleaching (which you all know can be QUITE dangerous) over top some old henna. My hair needed a bit of a pick me up and Olaplex is honestly magical. Aside from the color, I wouldn't be able to tell I'd just bleached my hair. It's so so so soft and there are NO split ends! I literally can't believe how wonderful this product is!I used it overnight. I got home, wet my hair in the sink, and ran the Olaplex through my hair. I started at the ends and worked my way up so I got a light coating up around my roots. I put on a shower cap and a towel over top to keep it insulated, and when I went to bed I put the towel over my pillow. I woke up and washed it out, and put a little bit of Lush's R&B on the ends before I blow dried it. My hair is SO SOFT now and not brittle at all. I am SO grateful that this product exists.

  I’ve been using this product for years and I will always stand by it and I constantly recommend it to everyone. However, it is important to note that this product works best if you’re already using other products that are good for your hair such as sulfate free shampoos and deep conditioners. Nonetheless, this is what will make your hair soft and silky after several rounds of bleaching, breakage, permanent and semi-permanent dyes, lighteners, and toners.note: olaplex won’t fix your hair or the damage done to your hair as only cutting it off permanently can give you the healthiest hair, but olaplex will help to build the bonds in your hair so that it doesn’t split and break.

  I am natural and after getting color and my hair straightened my hair was fried. I was working so hard to grow it and it was finally looking and feeling amazing. After I got my hair done, my hair just looked dead. My hair stayed straight after washing it. After several different protein and moisturizing treatments, I could see my hair on some parts trying to curl but other parts were just straight. I just finished using this for the first time had to write a review. There is not one straight strand. All of my hair looks amazing. Its not like it was but it looks 1000% better.

  Update: I've been bleaching my hair for over a year now. This is my 5th bottle of this olaplex. I stopped for a while because I find it expensive, but my hair got trashed really quick from two bleaching sessions with no olaplex in between. I even tried doing rice water protein masks, but didn't notice a difference. My hair was so damaged it wouldn't dry on its own and was falling out a lot more than usual. Went back to putting this on overnight once a week and after the first wash my hair felt semi soft instead of brittle. This stuff makes a huge difference and saves my hair so I can have that bleached look I enjoy.It's pretty expensive for how little comes in it. Also you have to leave it on way longer than the bottle says. I recommend leaving it on overnight or at least 4 hours. It didn't make my hair seem stronger or softer until after I did a 4.5 hour treatment on dry hair with it. Online it says after 45 min it does something, but that's not my experience. Also I have very thick hair halfway to my waist and it only did 3 treatments.

  My hair was so bleached it looked like cotton.  Toners washed right out with the first shampoo until I found Olapex 3.  It has changed the structure of my hair so it’s smooth and shinier, easier to style, too.

  Just bleached my hair pale ash blonde from a virgin level 2 black. Only shampoo once or twice a month, no or VERY rare heat, hair masks in lieu of washing about once a week. So my hair started out pretty healthy and stayed pretty healthy through the bleaching and toning but it got a bit dry on the ends.I used it after bleaching and before toning. I’ve only used it once but have also been doing hair oil treatments and some other hair masks I’ve never used before through the whole ordeal so it’s hard to pinpoint what helped most. I’ll update after a few weeks of use but whatever the cause, my hair is 99% back to its former glory (1% taken off because it’s got way more volume now which I’m assuming is due to some inevitable damage that I cannot feel with my fingers) even after 3 bleaching processes with 30 volume and one toning session with 20 volume. If you’ve already got unhealthy hair and you don’t take care of it, I doubt it’ll help you but it will probably help maintain healthy hair through something like bleaching.Note: I gave it 5 stars because it’s worth investing in but ideally I’d knock off a star because the bottle is so small (expected this. added carmex to a picture for scale) and you have to use so much even for a guy like me with shortish hair. Just not cost effective enough for me to buy it more than once seeing as I take good care of my hair.

  So grateful for this product.My fine thin curly hair was always so unsightly that until I was 24 I would wear a bandana or hat and took the time to wear it down just a few times a year and it still flew away and looked like crap within 30 minutes.... thats no way for a young woman to live. I had given up.I decided I’d relax it risking the chemical damage and there was a little, enough to risk length with my fine hair. The ends were so dry that they would tangle and break. This product made it as if I had always had long smooth straight healthy locks...And for that I am so grateful. I wear my hair down all of the time, have taken such delight in getting to know my hair and learning to style it, and feel like a new woman entirely. Thank you Olaplex. Relaxing my hair turned into a wonderfully life changing decision rather than a choppy gummy nightmare thanks to you.PS: I know they say it runs its course totally after 45 minutes but I feel like the result of the time I slept with it in was monumentally better than the time I washed it out after an hour.

  I was foolish and tried to bleach my hair myself and dye it purple.  Of course that didn't turn out so great.  I bleached it twice in one day because I couldn't get my natural dark hair light enough.  After it dried I was horrified at the damage I had done and my hair wasn't even blonde lol.  My hair was FRIED.  When I touched the ends it felt like pubic hair.  Sorry for my description but that's the best way I can describe it.I took the risk buying this on Amazon.  I was worried it wouldn't work since I never did step 1 and 2 but oh my gosh it worked.  After watching tutorials on youtube on how to properly apply it to damp hair I was surprised at how much better it felt.  It's not a miracle product, ladies and gentleman.  I still had to cut some of my ends but I didn't have to cut as much as I originally anticipated.  I may update pictures when i'm in better lighting so you can see proof.Piece of advice.  Apply on damp hair.  This helps you use less product.  Section your hair and make sure your hair is saturated.  Trust me, you don't have to use the whole bottle even if you have long hair.  A small amount will coat your hair.  I have hair past my shoulders and have done three treatments and still have a lot in my bottle.  Also, use a wide tooth brush on your hair to make sure it is coated evenly.I left it on for about 15 to 20 minutes and then added a hair mask on top of it and waited about 10 more minutes with it wrapped.  After that I rinsed it with cool water with a tiny bit of shampoo at the scalp area.I did not towel dry my hair since it can be harsh on brittle hair.  Instead I gently twisted my hair to remove excess water.  While my hair was damp I applied oil only to my ends and let it air dry.My hair feels amazing!  Good luck guys!  If you guys have just dry hair you probably don't need to do all the steps I did but I totally destroyed my hair.  And i'm telling you, just the product alone made my hair feel soft.

  Where to begin...first, this is NOT a conditioning mask!! Do not think that it is and try to use it as one. I use this on damp hair and left it on for 20 minutes. After, I washed my hair as usual. I blow dried on low heat and then straightened.My before hair:Dry, unmanageable, frizzy, lacklusterMy after hair:I have my hair back from when I was 18! After one use, I am blown away. Before, my hair wouldn't straighten even on the hottest setting, it would end up frizzy and immediately curl when I stepped outside. After my first use, I could turn my heat WAY down and my hair straightened like magic. I am ecstatic! I can't wait to see how it looks after a few months of using once a week.

  I don't do a whole lot of amazon reviews but this one deserves it.  I used this together with Olaplex No.1.  Put No.1 on dry, clean hair, then I put No.3 on over top of that.  I know it says to leave on 20 min, but I left on overnight.  First of all, it smells incredible.  I love the smell.  And then the next morning I shampoo and condition and after I dry my hair, after just one use there was noticeable difference in the texture and flyaways.  Did not weigh hair down, I have long, very fine hair that was over-processed and I use this 1-2 times a week and it keeps my hair very nice.  I will get it again.  Have used about 5 times and only halfway through both bottles

  I’ve used this one time so far but I saw the difference in my hair texture as soon as I got out of the shower. I left it in for about 20 min before rinsing out. My hair has been so damaged, it didn’t want to be it’s bouncy, curly self. I’ve bleached it many times over and finally saw the damaging effects. It was lifeless, straw like and kind of just limp. Also it tangled a LOT. I let my hair air dry and it felt soft and a lot less tangled for the first time in months! It was also curlier than I’ve seen it since June. Overall, super happy with the product. It’s a small bottle but using this saves me money on buying a million other products to tame frizz/ make it manageable. I used a bit frizz cream and I was good to go! I am going to use overnight this time like a few reviews suggested and see how that works.

    MOST AMAZING PRODUCT EVER
  
",5.0,Melissa R.,"Reviewed in the United States April 26, 2019","









  
  
    
  So I don't normally write reviews, but this product is so unbelievable I felt compelled to. I've had my hair bleached countless time over the past 4 years, and prior to that I colored my hair frequently with box dyes. I usually have a new hair color every few months so needless to say my hair was pretty brittle. Well I got my hair done (balayage) again about a month ago, and touched up the color with toner at home this week. Well after the touch up my hair was fried (I even used the lowest volume developer 10!). So I found this beauty of a product and decided to give it a try and I don't regret anything. This stuff Is AMAZING! Before using it I couldn't run my fingers through my hair because it was so dry & I was afraid of brushing it because I could just see it all breaking off and I'd pull heaps out of my brush. But after using this, for the first time since I started dying my hair I can run my fingers through my hair smoothly & I brushed my bed head out this morning with virtually no breakage and almost nothing ended up in my brush!I only left it on yesterday for about 1.5 hours and only used maybe an eight of the bottle. I'm going to try leaving it on overnight next treatment to see what that does. This product is 100% worth every penny.

  I have only used this product once and I can already see a huge difference in my hair. I had very dry, damaged hair after bleaching and not properly putting moisture in and after one use my hair feels less like hay. Obviously this is not a miracle, I do still need to keep up with maintenance and moisture masks, but it truly does make a difference even on the first use. I would say it is worth the price if you were in the same position as me where your hair needed serious repair, but expect a small bottle for the price being on the higher side. Bottom line, it really works and I would definitely purchase again.

  This is the greatest product I have ever used on my hair. I use a clarifying shampoo first then towel dry then put this on, wait ten minutes, rinse then shampoo and condition with my normal shampoo and conditioner. I have waste length hair and my hair has seriously not looked this amazing since I was in my twenties. My sister has shoulder length healthy hair. I had her try this and we were both stunned at what a difference it made. You literally get noticeably REPAIRED hair after just ONE use!! I strongly recommend the clarifying shampoo first though. That way you have no product residue on your hair and get the full benefit of the Olaplex.

  I ended up cutting my hair short in August of 2018 because my ends were looking pretty terrible and the rest of my hair wasn't too great either. I've been trying to grow it back out while taking better care of it, although because my hair dries super weird and frizzy, I usually end up using more heat than I want to. The Olaplex Hair Perfector No 3 has done a fantastic job of keeping my hair smoother and looking healthier.The directions say to leave on for at least 10 minutes, but I try to leave it on for at least an hour, usually close to two. I know that isn't possible for some of us, but I have noticed it definitely works better the longer you leave it on your hair! My hair is so soft and silky afterwards. My hair has grown out quite a bit in the last few months and I think the Olaplex might have something to do with that. It looks so much better than what it did before I cut it all off!

  Olaplex absolutely worked for me. In two sessions, it restored my over-colored/over-heated hair to a more attractive texture and has strengthened it noticeably. My pictures show my hair brushed after drying naturally before Olaplex, then after a home-coloring and two treatments of Olaplex. I love that you can leave the treatment on your hair and let it work overnight and it doesn't leave your head greasy. The downside as many have stated is the price and amount you get (one bottle only contains enough for me to use it three times, and my hair could use more repair than that). I wish this product was more affordable so people on different budgets could treat themselves. Will I buy it again? Maybe once in a blue moon when my hair is especially dried out and when I can spend a little extra.

  I was recommended this product by my hairdresser after I had decided to go from dark chocolate brunette to bleach blonde in a matter of 1 month. Any who knows hair knows that my ends were absolutely fried. I loved having my long hair but I wanted healthy hair as well. After the 1st use of Olaplex No 3, my hair felt like silk!

  Nurgle's Wife Here: I compared this with the Olaplex that I bought directly from Olaplex and it appeared to be the same in every way. I like Olaplex and use 3 regularly. It works great for keeping my hair in good shape and keeping split ends at bay. My hair is naturally wavy and if I don't feel like trying to coax out curls, I'll use a small amount of Olaplex in my hair after my shower, then brush my hair straight, and let it dry. It dries very straight, feels soft and smooth, and it doesn't feel weighed down (I don't use a lot of product, maybe a dime size, but I have thin hair so it doesn't take much for me.

  With #3, you get smoothed hair and long-term repair. The downside is, you have to use a generous amount of product to see immediate results. I don't use #1 or #2 but I'm guessing this works better when combined with those. The scent is great. I didn't find it as moisturizing so the 3rd time I used it I ""washed"" my hair with just conditioner afterwards and preferred those results. I did purchase #6 as well, which I gave 5 stars for instant, smoothing results and I only need a dime size of #6 on my long hair. My hair is colored but not damaged - I definitely recommend #3 for long-term help with damage and #6 for smooth results that make hair look better instantly and over time.

You have to wash your hair before using (as most of us with damaged hair, use products to keep the hair manageable), then apply the product, wait for it to work and take another shower to wash your hair again.

  So like many of you, I was stupid enough to bleach my hair at home.  Multiple times.  My natural hair color is a dark brown almost black, and I lightened it to nearly blonde so I could go red.  I loved the color but the damage, not so much.  It’s been like 5 months since I stopped bleaching my hair and it’s come a long way, but I still get comments about how to deal with the damage to my hair.  So I ordered this which came highly recommended.  I also bought the conditioner.  I left the product on over night and then woke up and washed and conditioned my hair.  I definitely notice a huge difference both in the texture and appearance of mg hair:  this is only after one trearment.  I’m doing round 2 tonight and will probably do 2-3 treatments a week for a while.  This definitely seems like it will help reduce the length I will need to remove.  Yay!

  Im very disappointed this is not the same product I purchased from hairstylists. I finshed off the product purchased from hairstylists and have been using ""Olaplex"" purchased from Amazon for the past 2 weeks. The product doesn't smell the same, feel the same nor does it condition my hair. I am very disappointed. I didn't mind paying double ($30 vs $15)via amazon to avoid having to bother hairstylists pickup the product for me. I'd rather pay her $30. I will be returning if possible.

  This product is amazing. It's transformed my damaged hair. I can't recommend this product enough. My stylist stopped using it in her salon in order to cut costs and switched to something else. Her new product doesn't work so I've been buying this myself and using it and getting the same great salon results. It makes my hair so soft and smooth. I have highlighted hair that only had minimal damage until I took a medication that caused my hair to fall out and break off. It was the worst my hair had looked in my life. It's slowly growing back and Olaplex is helping it to look and feel healthier as it grows out. I'm not great about using it religiously, but when I do my hair is amazing. 2-3 times a week is ideal for really damaged hair and you don't need much.

  My hair did not feel stronger or look healthier after using olaplex 3. I followed the directions exactly. Instead of repairing, it noticeably dulled my dyed auburn hair color. Then, gobs of hair fell out over the next couple weeks (regular shedding from the roots, not breakage from damage). I do not bleach my hair, I only use permanent dye to darken my hair. The good reviews I saw for No. 3 must really be for No. 1, used when lightening hair color in a salon?

  I’m an Olaplex convert. I have virgin, shoulder length, relatively undamaged hair, but it’s always been prone to breakage, frizzy, and not as shiny as I’d like. I wasn’t sure if this would do anything since my hair didn’t have too much damage to repair, but wow....it’s shinier than i’ve ever seen it, no frizz even on a rainy day, and it just looks and feels healthier. Looks like i got a blowout without the damage. I use it once every week or two to maintain results. Definitely worth the money. I just wish i could find it in a larger bottle.

  First:  definitely use a Clarifying shampoo. I actually used Dawn dish soap (it is gentle and works great) lathering up & rinsing twice before applying Olaplex 3. I was only able to leave product on my hair for 20 minutes but after rinsing, shampooing and following up with my usual leave-in conditioner, I let it air dry while lying down, not even attempting to style it (lazy day). After I let it dry, my mother noticed how shiny my hair was instantly (she was unaware I had used it). Very happy and will update as I use bottle.

",1.0,Nicole Bielski,"Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  I see that there are many positive reviews for this product, but also several negative reviews.  My experience was negative.  I started off with some dryness.  I was hoping this product would give me a smoother, silkier look like in some of the photos.  I've been lightening my hair for quite some time and touch up my roots every few weeks (I haven't dyed the length of my hair for a long time.)  I started using this once a week letting it sit on my damp hair for about 20 minutes before washing, deep conditioning and drying/styling as usual.  At first I thought it looked like it was making some small improvements.  And then…. my hair started breaking off.  I was in denial about it being the Olaplaex so I kept using it.  And things got worse.  Now I have a 3-4"" layer of broken off hair on the top layer.  It looks awful.  It's so obvious… I can't hide it unless I wear my hair up (difficult since my hair isn't very long.)  I cannot believe the breakage and damage this product has caused.  I figured the negative reviews were nonsense since there were so many positive reviews.  I think this can work for some, but for others it fries their hair off and causes irreversible damage.  In my opinion, it's not worth taking the gamble unless you're okay with all of your hair breaking off.  Maybe it'll work well for you.  Maybe you'll end up with a fried mullet.

  A friend recommended this product after my Aveda colorist did a balayage treatment on me for the first time. I have (or should I say HAD) long thick blonde hair. I used the product twice and started to notice a tremendous amount of breakage. I went back to my salon on Friday to address the problem and he asked me whether I was using this product (by name) and when I said ""yes"" he gathered his employees around me to demonstrate what happens when a color-treated blonde uses this product. They've had a number of clients have the same problem so he told me to throw the product out immediately. I was at the salon for 4 hours, and to avoid cutting my hair into a chin-length bob - I have to avoid blowdrying or flat ironing my hair for the next 3 months. I wash my hair twice a week, and let it air dry whenever possible. This is ridiculous. I look like I have a birds nest in the back of my head. Can't return it to Amazon (window expired) so now I'm throwing it away. Unreal.

  It's magic. OK, it's not magic, it's science and it performs.It's authentic (I have ordered from Amazon as seller and from the Olaplex website). Leaving it on damp hair for as long as possible, then shampoo and a goodly amount of conditioner is incredibly restorative.My hair is porous, it fades and it's not actually fragile but can get very dull and miscolored. This corrects that, softens my hair, sends frizz to the distant memory closet and adds shine.Average thickness, but longer than mid-back, a generous amount of this means 3-4 uses.It's so worth it.

  Waste of time & money. I saw absolutely no difference in my hair, even after 3 uses. When my hairstylist uses her olaplex on my hair it does wonders. She leaves it on for 10-15 minutes and in that one time my hair feels and looks so amazingly healthy.  This leads me to suspect maybe what I ordered from amazon is not really 100% olaplex...very disappointed. I would NOT buy this again...better off going to a salon or ordering directly from an authorized olaplex distributor.

  I heard all the rants and raves about Olaplex and wanted to try it at home. Mind you, my hair was pretty fragile from lightening it to a platinum color previously. This did not take away the dull, lifelessness of my hair fried hair. It made it pretty soft, but not any softer than a brand from a local beauty supply store. The formula was very watery and felt more watery than most drug store brand conditioners. This was purchased directly from Amazon so there should be no excuse for a ""fake"", although, this did absolutely nothing for improving my hairs quality. For your reference, I am a latina woman who has coarse, wavy, thick hair. Maybe this will work for super fine hair textures, but it did not work for my hair type.

  I have dyed blonde hair to base of my neck. I have been trying to use it sparingly. Got 4 or five treatments out of the bottle. Wish it wasn't so expensive. I do think I have noticed my hair has less breakage, looks a little healthier. Plan to let my grey grow out, getting lowlights soon to help it look gradual. I would purchase it again after my next salon visit. But then just keep it healthy with no more dying blonde. Blonde dye is better if you keep your hair shorter and get it cut regularly otherwise it is impossible to keep it longer and healthy looking. Don't like short hair!

  When I first started seeing people talk about Olaplex No 3 I was seeing the same old things: revolutionary product, will change your hair, repair, shine, smooth, reduce frizz, Heathy hair in one treatment! Uh-huh. Ok.I have hip length, 3B, CGM hair. I didn’t want to spend $30 on a product that was just like all of the other products promising the same things that I’ve been using for years. And for me a bottle would probably be one treatment. I was WRONG. This product delivers all of that on the first treatment. It is the single best hair product I’ve ever used.After one treatment (I can get about four treatments out of a bottle) my hair looked and felt better than it has in my entire life. I’ve been using 1 -2x per month and see improvement with every application. This stuff is amazing. It’s not a conditioning/ moisture treatment. It is a chemical treatment that repairs the damage. It actually  makes your hair more healthy by repairing bonds broken by heat, color, ponytail holders, dry brushing, environment, hard water, chlorine, etc.. My hair is mirror shiny, smooth, soft, and incredibly manageable. My curls are clumping on their own like they used to when I was a kid and I have increased shrinkage and volume. My hair is just healthy in a way it hasn’t been during my adult life.The directions say to apply to damp hair and leave on 10 min, then shampoo and condition. I leave it on until my hair drys which takes 2-4 hours and then I wash and condition. The extra time makes a noticeable difference in results for me. Their website says it’s safe to leave on for an long as you like, but they don’t recommend sleeping with it because it might get in your eyes. But I think you could do this with a plastic shower cap.Note: Olaplex 3 is CGM safe, but not all of the products from this line are. Which is a shame because I would happily spend the money on the shampoo, conditioner, and leave-ins if they didn’t have silicones.

",5.0,SlinkyPuffs,"Reviewed in the United States March 20, 2019","









  
  
    
  I learned about olaplex when the salon added it to my hair color.  I had been coloring my hair several years and had keratin straightened hair, then wanted to go blonde, and my poor hair was so dry it’s hard to even work shampoo through it when wet.  I accidentally found a stylist video on YouTube about olaplex recommending to use olaplex 3 at home to repair hair after coloring.  The salon failed to tell me about Olaplex 3, so I tried it.  What a difference in my dried out hair.  All I know is after using this one time, the shampoo and conditioner went through my hair like there was no damage, and after washing I can get a brush through my hair as well without tangles.  After blow drying, my hair is swishy, which it has never been swishy.  Feels good against my neck.  This is a tremendous product.  I think for the price there are about 5 treatments in the bottle for length to the shoulder hair, if using once a week.  I left it on my hair for one hour.  Very happy, this stuff is a miracle for my hair.  $28 vs another brand 5 procucts at $148, I’ll take the Olaplex.

  I used this for damage control after bleaching, and that's exactly what it did. I bleached my hair twice, and then dyed and toned it all in less than 24 hours, while using this in between, and I have very little to no breakage. I did use a different brand of bond protector while actually completing the bleaching and dying process (with different ingredients than Olaplex), but even after rinsing out the bleach and toner and color, I could feel that my hair was ""dry"" even while it was still wet (some of you know what I'm talking about!). This is where I applied the Olaplex - It has a recommended ""sit"" time of 10 minutes, but I left it on for about 30 each time. My hair is very soft, no ""crunch,"" has shine, and I sustained very little (if any) damage. I read somewhere that this No3 is supposed to build off of their No1 and No2, but I used this as a ""stand alone"" with that other bond protector I mentioned and it worked! I will probably purchase their maintenance shampoo. Also should be noted that even though I have done my hair many of times on my own, this past experience was a little more out of my control and I found myself having to do a few ""Hail Mary's"" to control the situation. My hair didn't turn out as I originally set out, but it turned out looking good and I am thankful I had the Olaplex this time around!

  All of my research about repairing damaged hair led me to Olaplex. I have used it once so far, and I am not impressed. However, that doesn’t mean it isn’t doing what it is supposed to do. I should mention I live in a very dry climate. I wanted shinier, stronger hair that wouldn’t break as much and would freely flow. My hair feels thicker, if nothing else, but in the way volumizing shampoo would make it feel. It seems to tangle worse than before, even immediately after brushing. Though the body is smooth, the ends are still frizzy and my hair clumps together in sections. I think a Keratin treatment is more what I’m looking for. I gave this 4 stars because it is probably doing what it should be doing and would be great for someone who likes volume, but I don’t think it is what I needed.

  READ THIS!!!I first have to say, I don't typically write reviews UNLESS the product blows me away, which is rare. To give you a little background about my hair. I had extremely HEALTHY, LONG, THICK blonde hair! It fell to the middle of my back, It was absolutely beautiful. I went to get it colored to give it a break from the highlights, I was going to change it to a strawberry blonde, which I have been many times before and other than blonde, its the only other color I like on me. When I went to the salon, they messed up the color. I ended up with hot pinkish, purple roots and a grayish auburn, mid-shaft to ends. I was in the salon that day for 7 and a half hours. They had to bleach my entire head and leave it on to get all of the screwed up colors out of my hair, resulting to EXTREME chemical damage and breakage. I went in with my hair being all one length to having bangs that were never even cut into my hair. My hair was destroyed and they had to take over 5inches off just to get the ends to LOOK healthy. My hair now sits on my shoulders and has broken pieces all over the top and mid section and all around my hair line. I have literally cried about this since it happened 5 weeks ago. It took me forever to get my hair exactly the way I wanted it and now I am starting over. My hair is no longer manageable, it is kinky and dry and looks it! The salon I had gone to was a new salon closer to where I moved. Prior to this salon I had been going to my original hairstylist for 15 years (I'm 30) so half of my life one person has touched my hair. I live two hours from her now so I decided to give a different salon a try and it was a mistake. I will now be driving 2 hours to go to her every 8 weeks. I texted her about 2 weeks after this all happened and she told me right away to order this product. I didn't hesitate. I ordered it and received it the beginning of this week. I have used it twice so far and I will tell you what, after the first time I noticed a difference! I am excited to see after a couple months and using this 3 times a week (Extremely damaged hair should use it more than once a week). I also have been sleeping with it on over night which I notice gives me better results. This is not a conditioning treatment, so it does need to be shampooed out. I have a feeling this product will be what saves my hair. I will post before and after pictures once I actually do my hair so you can see the difference!

  I learned about this product a very long time ago when I wanted to bleach my hair.  I wasn't sure if it would actually work or not despite seeing all the great reviews.  I recently bleached my hair from a dark brown almost black to a honey blonde which looked great but absolutely dried out my hair.  I knew I had to get my hands on a bottle of Olaplex to repair my hair somewhat.  I was skeptical of ordering through amazon due to some people saying that amazon is not a licensed distributor.  I don't know if this fact is true or not but the formula does work.  I think it may be watered down though.  One thing I must say is I saw it eliminated frizz which was an important factor for me.  My hair is pretty thick and just a little frizzy still.  I will definitely buy this again and continue to use it but purchase directly from Olaplex.

  I have type 4c kinky, tightly curled low porosity hair. My hair retains moisture very well because I know what products work and what don’t. The problem that I have is my hair is prone to breakage. I don’t like going too many protein treatments so I wanted to find an alternative.I was a little hesitant about buying it because I wasn’t sure if they catered to my hair type. The directions say to apply the treatment before shampoo but I applied it last after I deep conditioned. Since I have low porosity hair, I wanted to apply it last.I immediately noticed a difference when I detangled my hair. I didn’t have as much dead hair as I normally do. I’m so excited to have discovered this product and also happy that they cater to natural girls like me.It’s pricey but it’s worth it.

  I'm very satisfied with my Olaplex #3 purchase, it is legit and it works! I've noticed changes in my long, past shoulder length, 3A (natural spiral curl) hair. I've noticed some breakage, possibly due to me wearing my hair in topknots everyday. I've got dry hair and split ends, since using my hair actually feels thicker and stronger, and that 3 uses in in 3 weeks.

  i WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS TREATMENT FOR ANY HAIR TYPE EXCEPT THICK, VERY STRONG HAIR. It has been 24 hours since using this treatment. I left it on the maximum amount of time. Disclaimer: I have super fine, super thin, very very straight hair damaged over time by perms and color, neither of which, at age 75 I'm likely to stop doing, lol. So, that said, this product did leave my hair soft. VERY soft which, given the thin, fine, straight nature of my hair, isn't as wonderful as it would seem. My hair does feel very soft but soft do not compensate for it being FRIZZY or flyaway, which my hair still is DESPITE using Pur'ador cream rinse especially FOR thin, dry, permed hair. Also despite my very tight, curly perm, here's absolutely NO body left in the curls. Imagine perming a 3 year old kid's hair and that's about what I have. On the PLUS side my hair does feel wonderfully soft and looks shiny so if you have no other issues except dry hair it's worth a try. But if you're looking for a salon conditioning result....not sure you'll be happy and at THIS PRICE, HAPPY should be a minimum result.

  The first time I used it, I only left it on for like 10 minutes and it didn’t do much, plus I did it in the shower when my hair wasn’t really towel dry like the instructions say. Mind you, my hair is severely damaged from bleaching it (5 times in one night lmao) to white, then eventually dying it brown, pink, bleaching it again and dying it brown. The next time I did it, I towel dried, put it all over evenly, and left it on for like 4-5 hours. My hair is drastically healthier and feels better.TIP: Switch between this and a hydrating product. You don’t want to use a protein treatment too often, or a hydrating product too often. I’ll probably do this once a week and another hydrating one once a week on another day so I can eventually get my hair healthy again.

  18 months ago I had a full head of purple hair. My hair has been bleached time and time again, I finally decided to go back to my natural brown with a blonde balayage, Needless to say, even going to a professional who was VERY mindful with my hair, always doing things slowly as not to damage it, I still ended up frying my hair. I have thin hair and an oily scalp so I stay away from heavy conditioners or products that add to the oily look. Being purple for a year, almost black before that, and heavily highlighted before that, my hair had been through a lot of stress. A few weeks ago I was so sick and tired of the breakage (visible when brushing), like BAD breakage, I finally decided to try out the Olaplex I had heard so much about. I didn't tell my stylist I was doing it, but I would be seeing her a few days after my treatment for a touch up. As soon as she started working with my hair she asked my what I did that it looked so so healthy. We ended up not having to cut much off because it was so great. I was preparing to cut off three plus inches and this stuff saved me. I listened to a friend of mine who is a prof stylist and works with vivids who reccomended I sleep with it on. i got about 10 hours with it on over night, washed and styled my hair like normal the next morning and I havent had to straighten it to ""tame"" it since. i have been styling it just blow drying it with a round brush.

  Olaplex is only receiving 2 stars based on the VISIBLE effect this had on my hair. Potentially it did ""strengthen my hair from within"", but that's beyond my capacity to assess.Applied it overnight, but it did absolutely nothing for my chemically treated hair.Shortly afterward I did the formaldehyde-free Peter Coppola keratin treatment - and got a new head of hair. I got so many compliments; ""You look so great, not sure if it's your hair or what..."" (And it was.)However, the question remains: DOES it really strengthen the hair. I'll do my research on this, as keratin treatments don't actually prevent the hair from future breakage.

  I decided to grow my hair out and let it curl.  My bestie (who is a stylist) gave me very specific instructions on curly hair care, including the once a week use of Olaplex 3.  Don't let the 3oz bottle size deter you. You only use a small dab once a week so the bottle should last several months.  Such wonderful results, people are now commenting on my awesome hair.

  I discovered Olaplex at a previous hairdresser and began purchasing it online after moving. I have thick, medium coarse hair and I use this once or twice a week to keep my hair in good shape. I find if I add Olaplex to towel dried hair and leave it in all night, it does a really excellent job.

  I had big hopes for this tiny bottle.  My hair was double processed from a natural bark brown to a blonde then greyish brown. At the end of my day at the salon my hair was dry brittle and beyond repair.I scoured amazon for something to help. Before Olaplex, when I washed my hair, it would feel strangely spongy. After the first treatment my hair felt the closest to normal since double processing my hair.I had to do a double take and start the process over again when using Olaplex no. 3. You use it as a mask first on damp hair for 10 minutes and then go on to shampoo and condition. It felt very odd to do so but it’s worth following the directions.Ps if you see that my hair color is different in the before and after, it’s because I used a color boost with my conditioner. I didn’t like the dirty grey the salon had given me.

  Oh my! OK, so I was looking for a product to help make my hair stronger. I went from natural to relaxed. I did some research and heard about this product. Bought and bottle and was amazingly surprised of what this little powerhouse product can do. YOU must use it BEFORE you shampoo, which is a strange direction, but this is a bond builder, not a conditioner or 'treatment' as we know it. My hair is softer, stronger, shiner. I have Salt 'n Peppa hair, so keeping it soft was always a challenge.  Adding Olaplex #3 to my routine was the right choice.

    Great, but Not a Miracle Worker
  
",5.0,Brittanie,"Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  MAIN POINT: I do highly recommend as I'm familiar with Olaplex and stand by the statement that it does wonders for your hair -- but don't expect a miracle no matter how much you use or how long you leave it on your hair. What a lot of people don't know or they refuse to acknowledge is that you can't bring dead hair back to life once you've heavily compromised it. Only cutting it off will completely undo whatever damage you've caused to your hair.I purchased this perfecter in order to start strengthening/prepping my hair throughout this  week for bleaching this weekend (I'm going from washed-out-red/orange back to blonde, so protection is def necessary), and after just 2, 1-hour-long uses so far I've already got noticeably softer hair.1 downside I noticed is that my hair doesn't LOOK any different. I have naturally wavy, sometimes frizzy hair and the treatments have so far not tamed my texture so if you're looking at before/after pics where people immediately styled their hair after, then yes theirs will look really different because they styled it. I wouldn't recommend styling  until a couple of days after your last treatment as you've JUST added all that moisture back into your hair and styling immediately after is just gonna fry it right back out.

  I really enjoyed this product! As someone who has been color treating and bleaching my hair for almost 5+ years now, my hair has definitely been through some damage! While I try to avoid using heat as much as I can, the bleach has left my hair dry and brittle. At this point, my hair has been breaking off, creating fly-aways and overall damaged hair. I bought this product, under the recommendation of a friend, and am very very happy with it. I showered, combed my hair out, and applied this product overnight. I slept with it in, and rinsed it out in the morning (with just water, not shampoo). Now it is three days later and my hair has never been more smooth, un-tangled and shiny! I love this stuff, and will definitely be purchasing again. The only downside is the amount of product that you get for the money, however, you don't need much of this stuff for it to work!

  I swear by this stuff. The before is a month ago. My hair has grown a decent amount. About an inch. It grows fast. I started watching brad mondo and was introduced to olaplex. The before picture is before I started using olaplex and the after is proof my hair looks healthier. Before my hair was dry and straw like now the ends are soft like virgin hair. Before I started using olaplex, I was thinking about shaving my head but now I don't have to. It softens extremely damaged hair and the scent is amazing. If it doesn't work, you're probably not using it right. Dampen your hair when your hair is dirty. Put olaplex in for an hour (that's what I do once a week) then rinse it out, wash your hair and use regular conditioner. The directions state clearly on what to do. It is not conditioner so don't use it as such or leave it in. Oil is for that not the type 3 olaplex. It works just follow the directions.

Once that proved to be safe, I saturated my entire head, using around 5 dollops. (My hair is a little past my shoulders.) I left it on a total of 2.5 hours, followed by shampoo and conditioning as per the directions. I personally noticed improvement from this first use alone.

Long story short I bleached my hair like 10 times and at first it was stretchy and I had some breakage but after using this, the Aphogee 2 step protein treatment and the Schwarzkopf keratin potion and mask my hair is soft and manageable. The olaplex no 3 is for sure what makes the biggest difference. The longest I’ve left this on is for 3 hours but at a minimum I leave it on for one.

  I purchased Olaplex after reading tons of both positive and negative reviews.  What I learned:  1) You must was your hair with a clarifying shampoo prior to using Olaplex 3.  The chemical bonds can’t reconnect if your hair has build up from product or hard water. 2) Olaplex needs to be washed out of your hair with a clarifying shampoo.  3). Olaplex is not a conditioner so it will not hydrate your hair.  If you have dry damaged hair you must apply a conditioner after using Olaplex.  If you follow these three steps you should have a successful outcome.  I’m 48 years old and have been bleaching my hair since high school (30 years).  I am pleased that my natural waves have returned and the frizz is gone after using Olaplex 👍

  My white/grey curly hair was getting too dry and frizzy so I decided to give this a try - left it on for a few hours and when I rinsed it out, my hair felt very soft and silky.  I also used the Olaplex shampoo, conditioner and leave-in  Even with my hair wet, I could tell that my hair was healthy, silky, smooth with perfect curls.  Once it dried it looked fantastic and it did keep the frizzies away till I washed it again.  Very happy that Amazon carries it.

  Wow. I wish I would have taken a before picture. I had severe brittle bleached hair and terrible split ends. After using this once (kept in hair for about 4 hours), my hair was noticeably softer, less straw like feeling at the tips, and my split ends have disappeared...there might be a few hair strands that are still split, but for the most part they're gone. It seems like the Olaplex bonded them together. I heard that every time you use this - your hair just keeps getting better and healthier, and i'm looking forward to it and will use once a week.

  This product works!! My very long nautural hair was bleached  & dyed light Ash brown color and so the hair texture was destroyed & damaged!! It became brittle, frizzy, coarse & dry, no shine, tangly & unmanageable; my hair looked like a garden broom from the back. This product had such positive reviews so I gave it a try. I was so glad I did & would definitely recommend it to others who have damaged hair like mine. I used 1/3 of a bottle to saturate hair and left on inside a shower cap for 4 hours, followed by rinse with water, no shampoo since I washed hair a day but did conditioned & blowed dry right away to see the result. I rejoiced at what a huge difference it made. The texture of my hair felt like the one in a Pantene comercial...it became so soft & bouncy and my fingers glided down the silky smooth hair without any chocks of knots. I didn't even use a comb at all. Hair looked revived and healthy. The hair repair was so dramatic that I had to share a review on this product.

  Some of the reviews said their product was fake and watered down. This was not the case for me. I recently lifted my natural almost-black hair to platinum blonde/silver. It took 3 salon visits to lift me this much, so parts of my hair were damaged and stretchy.  I received this yesterday and immediately got my hair wet, and put this all over my head, concentrating on the fuzzier parts. I put on a disposable shower cap, and wrapped my hair in a towel. I left it on for about four hours. I have very thick, coarse, shoulder length hair and used 1/4-1/5 of the bottle. It was not watered down, and it smelled very nice-not like chemicals. After 4 hours, I washed and conditioned my hair as normal. When I got out of the shower, I combed my hair and could already see a huge difference! No more stretchy-ness in the damaged areas. Now that it is dry, it is much less fuzzy in the more processed areas. My hair doesn't feel softer (which is fine, my hair doesn't really soften anyways), but it LOOKS way healthier. I am amazed by this product. I would recommend it to anyone. I think by the time I am done with the bottle, my hair will be back to normal. I would also recommend to just dampen your hair, not completely saturate it. I feel that I was able to get more coverage with damp hair than soaked hair.

  I wish I had known about this product a long time ago. My hair is relaxed, keratin treated AND has red highlights. Naturally, I like living dangerously and I have to always be looking for products that actually work.I am addicted and I'm going to get my hands on all Olaplex products I can possibly have.My hair is so silky and beautiful - I can't believe it's mine. I applied once in between the relaxer and the keratin treatment and saw an improvement. Applied two more times after the keratin treatment, and I'm really impressed. This is truly the best product I've ever used. I didn't think humanity had come up.witb anything better than Kérastase yet. But this is it!This tiny bottle only lasted me 3 treatments because my hair is mid back length and thick, and I also throughly soak the hair - ABSOLUTELY WORTH EVERY PENNY.

  This product is trash. I have 3c hair and it’s completely natural - no relaxers, no color. 2 days ago, I got a trim and decided to use the product for strengthening. Yesterday, I applied it for 10 min and washed it out. Then  I applied lots of coconut oil and wore it naturally for the evening. Today I noticed it was super dry and brittle. So I decided to wash it completely out with my aveda shampoo and conditioner. When I brushing my hair with the conditioner in it, I noticed short pieces of my thick hair in my hands. It clearly caused breakage to my healthy hair. Hoping this is the worst of it. I will never use this product again, and to many other reviewers’ point, I will always order a hair product directly from the manufacturer. This also had a weird and intense chemical smell akin to a relaxer. If you have natural hair, don’t use this.

  If you bleach your hair to make it blonde, you simply must use olaplex because it justnplaun works. Bleaching strips each hair shaft, makes it thinner, brittle and dry. Olaplex number three helps build it back up, repairing weak spots. You end up with hair that almost feels as if you hadn't bleached it. Your hair is stringer and sleeker again, instead of ""fried"". I remember long ago Kim Kardashian saidnshe leaves it on under a shower cap overnight and washes it off in the morning. I tried that and the sound of the shower cap woke me up too much and was coming off and messy. So now I just put it on generously and out it all up in a clip for several hours as I hang out around the house and wash it out, condition and air dry. I love this stuff and have bought it many times now. I have sort of long and thick hair- so I get three treatments out of one of these little bottles.  It is so worth every penny for me. P.s. it does not add moisture to hair, but rather adds proteins etc to build and heal hair.

  Let me start off by saying that I never leave reviews of things I buy, but I tried this out as soon as I received it and it’s my new holy grail hair mask! I have bleached blonde hair, and my ends were starting to look extremely dry. I covered my hair in this and left in for about 40 minutes and as soon as I washed it out my hair felt so soft. Once it dried there was a noticeably big difference in my hair. I’ve tried plenty of hair masks but none have left results like these on just one use. Only downside I would say is that it’s a pretty small bottle, I have thick and long hair so for one use I’m already half way through the bottle. Other than that I would definitely recommend this to anyone needing to bring their hair back to life.

  As a blonde I am no stranger to damaged hair. About 2 yes ago my hair got to the point where it was over processed and started to break. I was SO self conscious about this because I always thought of my hair as my best feature. THIS PRODUCT HAS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE!!! By no means did this work over night but slowly my hair has started to grow longer and thicker again. I’ve been using 2-3 times a week and once I meet my goal length will cut down to 1x. I have also been using collagen too which makes a big difference!

  After my stylist left the bleach on entirely too long, my hair needed major help. My ends felt stringy, rough, and mostly just broke when touched/brushed/were wet. It was a mess.I ordered this product from Amazon rather than the olaplex website because I needed it NOW. When I read some of the reviews that said it was fake and counterfeit, I got nervous and ordered the other one directly from the company.This is the exact same product. Both this and the one I ordered direct have significantly improved the condition of my hair.  I can actually touch it again and it feels like hair instead of hay.Oddly, the label on the one from the company was bubbly and looked more fake than the Amazon bottle. I don't know if ALL these come from the same distributor but I'm glad I got the real thing.I would definitely recommend trying this if you have damaged hair! If your hair is generally in good condition, I'm not sure the type of results you would get. I imagine it wouldn't be as drastically different as mine.

  This does what it says.  I’ve used it once in 4 weeks and my hair still looks great!Everyone is different.  I have generally abundant healthy strawberry blonde hair, longer (mid back) with a lot of static, dryness, “flatness”  and more split ends in winter.I applied as directed, erred on the side of thoroughness, left it on overnight, and rinsed in the morning to get the most out of the first application and it yielded the desired effect.I still use quality products for regular washing and conditioning and my hair looks far better than it has in previous years. This product has eliminated all those winter issues, each strand still looks healthy and vibrant 4 weeks later, has wonderful body and shine, and no static.I’m pleased, and I imagine will get another application or two out if this bottle if I apply it the same way when the need arises.

  This is moisturizing and works okay for dead or split ends, I’ve noticed my ends looking much healthier. It has a nice scent and isn’t overpowering, it just smells like salon shampoo! I will say it is a very small amount of the product for the price. I have been able to make it last longer by pairing it with other products after the first few uses. I have used it 4 times and have about 1/3 of the bottle left (that’s just with me applying this to my ends and then gently distributing it upwards) so it doesn't last long. I don’t think I will be reordering this because of the small amount you get for the price, I just don’t feel like it made my hair grow or stay hydrated as well as it should. Overall it’s a good product and did moisturize but just not the results I am looking for in that price range.

  I bleach my hair as pale as I can to dye it various fantasy colors. My hair was in very good shape when I started bleaching it half a year ago and I’m doing my best to keep it that way. After hearing the glowing reviews I decided to try Olaplex to maintain and improve my hair’s health.I started using Olaplex a month and a half ago. My hair was newly bleached and dyed and felt a little dry, frizzy, and stressed. I applied the Olaplex once a week, for at least an hour, but often longer. I also use a coconut oil mask every week or two.I noticed an improvement, but wasn’t immediately sure it was the Olaplex until I bleached my hair again. Right after the bleach and toner my hair didn’t feel bad at all. A little dry, but not as bad as before and not at all stressed like the last time. I think it’s made a big help to my hair and as long as I continue to bleach my hair I will be using Olaplex. I’m also going to buy Olaplex 1 and 2 for future bleaching.

  I read about this product in some beauty internet article (Elle?). It was to be miracle product to bring my blond dyed hair to shining healthy hair. I got fried, dry, and color STRIPPED hair. Just returned it but now what. I have to have it cut shorter and hope that my NATURAL shine and health will come back. What a rip off. I should be able to charge the manufacturer for my haircut and emotional distress.

  This is GREAT for strengthening your hair, but it does bother me the company isn't honest about what it is. It is NOT a conditioner. After you use this, you need a GREAT conditioner. I just wish they would be honest. Now, I see they are selling shampoo and what?....a conditioner! Shocker.  I have had a lot of breakage over the years for various reasons. Thus is the best strengthener I've ever used. Adds a ton of volume. Great product. I should disclose I bought directly so can't speak to authenticity here.

  This is perfect for what I bought it for. I had to bleach my hair and was advised this would help from breakage and drying. It worked wonders. I would definitely recommend if you are looking to bleach your hair. I just popped a decent amount in the bowl with the bleach and put it on my hair. Hair feels great. Now the product on its own works well too but my hair is already oily so I only use it on the ends but it still makes my hair a little too oily. I will probably use it as a mask and rinse it out the morning after.

  Soo upon reading the reviews on this olaplex, I was a little torn whether not if it was real or a fake, tbh.  But I took the risk n ordered it, and since I received it the other day I finallyDecided to do a treatment today on my hair. I can genuinely tell u that this is the real thing. I had a little left over from a previous olaplex that I ordered from Sephora and I tested the bottle, smell and of course texture of the product. But most importantly, if it worked on my hair just as my other bottle. And it did!! I got the same or better results. So if you were feeling like I was on whether or not it’s real, don’t worry it is! And if u have prime u can save a little for shipping! Hope this helps someone.

  *update* it took me a while to realize THIS IS NOT A CONDITIONER! Once I started using it as a treatment instead of eclectic it tomake my hair soft,  I understood this is like when you use a protein treatment or some other kind of repair, it's not softening it's repairing, I started using a small amount of leave in conditioner after my shower and I notice better hair, not a lot, not enough to buy again but pretty good if it we're cheaper I'd buy it again.*old review* I'll update my review after using it a while but my initial impression is that I don't understand the hype. I use cheap deep conditioning packets that are way better. It did temporarily soften and smooth but a day later my hair looks almost fried. ( I did dye it and use another product loreal elvive smoother) but it seems like for $28 bucks I would've thought wow! But I'm like mehSo far. Maybe using it after the salon olaplex treatment (what you're supposed to do instead of a standalone item) I bet it would be much better.

",3.0,Susan466,"Reviewed in the United States May 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  This product is a bit of bother to use, so you really want it to work.  I tried it 2x as I always run 2 experiments.  Both times it totally straightened my short fine wavy hair.  I use curly girl techniques/products to enhance my curliness, so straight was not the desirable result.  It lasted a week in each case and I had to work to get it curly again.  It was softer, smoother,  ""younger"" looking hair.  I think it would be great on long straight hair.  Or perhaps tightly curly hair that does not straighten so easily.  The first time I only left it on the recommended 10 minutes.  The next time after watching a few videos I applied a more generous amount and left it on 30 minutes.  Same result... Straight Hair!  It DOES remove frizz, that's for sure.

  I used this as it was directed. The first week for 20 minutes, skipped a week, and the next week for 50 minutes. I couldn't do anymore, it was so drying.I have a mix of 2C- 3B hair type, but extremely coarse strands. I've bleached and dyed my hair in the past (most of which is cut off now) but I thought this would add moisture and define my curls. It did the opposite. My hair felt extremely dry and brittle after.I normally don't do anything to my hair in regards to heating/ styling, coloring, or anything, so if you're natural I wouldn't recommend this.I understand for some people it works wonders, for me it did not. With the price point and advertising it's for ""all hair"" you'd think it'd have some beneficial affect. I guess it's trial and error. I'll stick to my jojoba and argan oils.

  It’s a tiny bottle for the price, but worth it. If you spend a ton on getting your hair colored then this makes sense. I only use it once a week and it makes my hair far less brittle and overprocessed. It only takes a little. I just happened to see this in a magazine as one of Drew Barrymore’s favorite items. I ordered on amazon. I had just changed salons and realized my new Salon uses it. Even though I love when my salon tries different things on me I always request that they use this because the after effect after a coloring is so noticeable.

If you have long hair you’ll be lucky to get probably 2 uses at the absolute most out of it. For a mother of two, dropping that type of money on a hair product is hard.

  I was a bit skeptical when I seen the price for such a small bottle, but I said to myself treat yourself the reviews keep selling you 🤷🏽‍♀️!  I’m natural with a million different hair patterns and it seemed like no matter how well I took care of my hair I could never get my hair to be curly enough to wear it fully natural. I would suffer some type of heat damage no matter how much heat protectant or how low of a heat setting I used, even the 1 pass method, damage would always appear.  I consistently used this for a month by washing my hair once weekly and using this as a pre conditioner or a mixed in my deep conditioner.  The heat damage is reverting and my hair bonds are thickening and looking stronger.  This definitely repairs the bonds and and give your hair life again no matter the texture.  I didn’t use steps 1 or 2 prior but I did also use their leave in conditioner and bonding oil when using this.  I definitely would recommend his product and even buying it from here.  I’ve seen a lot of reviews where they said they feel like they received a different product but I can honestly say I’ve never had this treatment done in a salon and the product I received seems to be legit since it’s repairing my hair.

  If you have high porosity, natural, textured hair, I highly recommend this! I'm very excited about this treatment. It feels like a conditioner when applied (although it is NOT), and when I washed it out an hour later, my hair felt obviously in better condition. My strands were clearly smoother, shinier and easier to comb through. I plan to use this especially for the bottom half of my hair because that gets the most breakage. I have about 10"" of afro-textured hair and used about half a bottle. Maybe I was heavy handed, but I see myself using this continually once a month or every 6 weeks to make sure my hair is as strong as possible. I also alternate between henna glosses and cassia treatments as my deep conditioners on other weeks. I use rice water, flaxseed gel-I'm a super diy natural hair advocate. But sometimes you do need to fill in the cracks with the power of chemistry. This just fills in anything missing in my routine for repair. It doesn't mess with anything else I'm personally doing, although I have 10 years experience with my natural hair (3 big chops, know how to make my hair grow quickly). I'm definitely fitting this into my routine. My hair looks and feels AMAZING! Excited to see how this will help my hair over the long term which seems like where you'd see the biggest benefit. Try it! They have trial kits if you're not sure. But at least N°3 is worth spending the money on. Going to try the conditioner soon too.Also the price is high, but for what it is, it's worth it. There's plenty of other treatments that cost the same but don't work as well.

  Ok...I have been rolling my eyes about this stuff for months, refusing to purchase, opting for cheaper products. During Covid I have subjected my hair to bleachings with novice overlapping, over processing, mixing the home kit wrong, box dyes, cheaper home hair cut scissors, you name it. I am now guilty of it. But I also admit to have learned so much! I almost lost hope with my top blondes, which are now fragile, like whispers of the ghost of my previous hair. I got Olaplex #3 and expected nothing, since I have tried coconut oil, sweet almond oil, avocado oil, argan, leave in conditioners, It's a 10, lamellar water, protein filler, egg yolk and honey masks. ETC. Then I tried this. I could feel after the very first use that it was different. The pics are before first use and after the second use, wet and dry. No other product in my hair. I could have spent $28 on this instead of the handful of !*@(*#)$* that I already tried! Also, I ordered another directly. Same smell, same consistency, both sealed. I'm not a cult member and I expect to still have to keep my blondes in rehab until they grow out...but I now have hair that feels like hair. It really is a Covid hair miracle. FWIW--I use no heat and style very sparingly, as damaged hair is damaged hair. Be realistic and while it may FEEL like magic, it doesn't make the damage permanently healed. I apply to freshly washed hair and left on for an hour each time. I may regret it but ordered 0 to see if it helps and will review when I try that in conjunction with 3. Also am using this on my lightened peekaboos underneath to see if I can help breathe new life into that hair before my bright pinks go on top. There is hope to sport a messy bun again. HAhHhaha yes, goals. Right now I gingerly wear it back in a cloth hair tie. Watch out for home self bleaching jobs...they can get addictive. And I now have a whole world of understanding as to why it is best to see a professional, always!

There are plenty of how-to videos out there if you'd like to watch before your first use. When I first started using it, my hair wasn't in a good state and I let it stay in my hair longer than the minimum time.

  There are two common reviews that I want to address.  1st, that the product is damaging their hair.  If you need Olaplex, your hair is already damaged.  You hair is falling out and breaking because you bleached it.  Olaplex is amazing but it isnt going to glue your hair back together.  What it will do is bond your hair that hasnt yet reached the point of breaking and it will help but some hair cannot be helped. 2nd is that the product is too expensive for what you get.  (sigh)  So here is the deal,  You tried to bleach your own hair because you thought it would be soooo much cheaper.  Your hair is burned and falling apart so now you want to find a cheap way to fix your hair. (sigh)  Insert Brand Mondo rolling his eyes.  Good product costs money honey.  You are welcome to get something cheaper but remember that you get what you pay for.

  I've only used this once and I feel a huge difference. My hair was breaking a lot from repeated bleaching. I freaked out and researched products, and their patent impressed me, so I decided to pay $28 for a tiny bottle of stuff. I'm not usually the kind of person to splurge on stuff like that. So far it seems like the $28 dollars was definitely a worthy investment. After one use my hair doesn't feel like straw, it feels like it's returning to normal, while weeks of conditioning did nothing.

  I have extremely long and thick hair (down to my bottom) and I have had it bleached before. This stuff has made my hair softer and silkier than it has ever been before. It’s also much easier to comb and brush. I use foam curlers, and my curls are so much more lush and healthy-looking than they used to be. I only wash my hair once every two weeks, so that’s how often I use this product.The ONLY reason this doesn’t get 5 stars is because of how little product you get in that tiny bottle. I use the entire bottle with only 2 washes, so I am constantly running out. If the company ever makes a larger bottle available to consumers, I’ll amend my review.

  This is the same deep conditioning treatment my hair stylist uses, she recommended buying a bottle rather than paying the same amount to come in for one treatment. Depending on how much hair you have you can get a few treatments from this little guy. I leave it in my shower and put it in for at least 10mins- then rinse it out, use my usual shampoo and conditioner.

  For the price of this small bottle i had very high expectations, and it truly delivered! This is not a hair conditioner. As it says on the bottle, it is a “hair bonder”. I am 55 years old and I dye my gray Asian hair every 3-4 weeks. This makes my hair very frizzy and dry looking no matter how much I condition. After using this twice- I washed my hair first, towel dried it, applied olaplex and left it on for 10-15mins each time. Then I did a quick rinse and towel dried it again. I blow dried it and the result is just amazing! No more frizz and fly-away hair. That was 2 days ago and still looks good.

  It arrived fast! It was my first time using it so I'm honestly not sure how to compare it to Olaplex bought from Sephora or anything. Not sure how you would tell it was a fake or not. But I loved the product! It made my hair extremely soft when I was washing it out and it seems slightly healthier! The first time I used it, I messed up though. Apparently when using this, you need to wash it out with a low poo or shampoo and deep condition. I didn't and my hair looked aweful. It was frizzy and flat and wouldn't curl right. I have wavy/curly 2b to 3a thick, fine hair. Once I low pooed and deep conditioned, my hair came back to life, and I have liked it since using it right!

This product works in the bonus of you hair so fro the inside. Don’t expect that you will feel that is super soft because it repairs your hair inside out. Overtime because it will recover your hair you will feel it stronger. I recommend leaving the product over night and when washing condition and use a hair mask. It will leave your hair flawless.

  I can’t say enough positive things about this. It literally saved my hair. I tried several other bond repair treatments prior to using this because other reviewers were saying it’s not that great, but it is. My hair had been over processed from years passed, two current treatments of color oops and a current bleach wash (even though I have level 4/5 ask brown hair). My hair was rough to say the least. Touching it would make you cringe. Literally straw. In December I had 8” cut after the recent treatments I did and I vowed to get my hair healthy again for good and grow it back. Even deep conditioning and the other bonding treatments didn’t help as drastically as olaplex did. I always had these patches, especially on the side, that looked like they were dead ends, except they weren’t. (You know those frizzy, dead looking things more towards the top of your head)...yeah. So, I bought this. I used it once a week for now one month. My hair is now baby soft. No exaggeration. No frizz, no dryness, no dead ends...nothing. My stylist said it is soooo much healthier. I keep asking her to trim it and she keeps saying there is just no need for it especially since I’m trying to grow it back. I seriously can’t even remember the last time my hair has been this healthy! My bottle isn’t even empty yet and I am VERY liberal with it. (My hair is just past my shoulders right now but thinner). I leave in for one hour (after shampooing and conditioning) and follow with a deep conditioner after every use. I will most likely purchase another bottle after this one and continue the process for at least a few months. I should have thought to take a before pic and will add one if I can find one that counts.

  Used this for a month and saw zero difference. In fact, if anything, my hair felt grubby or something where the build up was building up not smooth or evenly. For 28.00 I expected more.The bottle is so hard to open if your hands are wet, it's annoying and frustrating. Again, for 28.00 I'd expect a little more effort in the designing of this to make it easier to use.

  My hair is very damaged from bleach so I thought I'd give it a go. I understood that the product was only 3.5oz, but the directions say to apply generously from roots to ends - I have above shoulder length hair and I had to use about 1/4 of the bottle to saturate it. The kicker is that for damaged hair it says to apply 2-3 times a week, and once a week for normal hair. I might be able to get 2 weeks out of this bottle, a month if I only apply to my ends. My hair did feel better after one use, but unfortunately for me 3.5oz at $28.00 for two weeks is not practical, and I wont be purchasing again. Nice product though.

  Well worth the price. I suffer from Hashimoto's and Rheumatoid Arthritis, both of which make your hair dry and fall out. That coupled with hair bleach and dye destroyed my hair. Instead of cutting it off, I bought the olaplex set,and, my hair is shiny and soft. I will never use anything else. If you are worried about the high price tag,don't. With this stuff,a little goes a long way and I promise you, it works.

  After seeing all the great reviews I thought this would at least *help* to repair my bleached and dyed hair and *help* with the split ends. One use and half a surprisingly small and ridiculously expensive bottle later, I’ve noticed no improvement. If you have thick hair, coarse hair, long hair, or maybe any hair at all, I’d suggest you try something else.Info: “4c” natural hair, bleached and dyed, middle back length.

  I have thick, naturally very dark hair, usually when I colour my hair much lighter, my hair tends to dry out, become brittle and dull. This is magic in a bottle, using this product regular my hair is now manageable, shiny and super healthy.  At first I used it once a week and kept it on overnight. Now I use it every couple of weeks and keep it on for a couple of hours or so. The longer you leave it on the better the results are. I also use the conditioner once a week, again another amazing product.  As far as the bottles I received from Amazon, I can say these are the real product, I compared them to the ones I bought from Sephora and they’re identical.

  Works wonders on my hair. My hair has been very dry and damaged from too much straightening and curling from hot tools and my ends were starting to look terrible. To be honest, I have thin hair, do not get hair cuts often, and I blow dry and straighten or curl my hair almost every single day so my hair goes through a lot on a daily basis.  I heard about this product from a relative who is a hair stylist and she said she uses it often and it is amazing for your hair. I used it for the first time a few days ago but I did not have much time to keep it on for very long so I left it on around 15-20 mins and after blow drying my hair it looked much healthier. My hair was silky and soft with less visible damage and that was only after 1 use. I am very positive it will only get better the more I use it and the longer I keep in on my hair if it worked well after only one 15 min use.

  My hair's color treated and it's only slightly damaged and of course super dry. my hair is pretty long and after saturating my hair with it HALF the bottle was gone and I was ok with that because that's what happens when you have long hair. After leaving it on my hair for 1.5-2 hours I shampooed and conditioned as usual and blow-dried my hair but I have not noticed any change, difference whatsoever. A 14$ treatment (since half of the bottle's gone after one use) and NO change at all?! that's very disappointing. I'll be doing the process one more time next week and update if I see any difference after 2 times use. Bottom line: it's a very expensive treatment and not really worth it.

    Olaplex System For Life
  
",5.0,Junior Photog,"Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  I'm freshly out of the shower after using Olaplex No. 3, 4, and 5 (shampoo and conditioner). In 2017, for the first time in my 54 years, I had crown breakage to the point of seeing my actual scalp! I hit YouTube and began to watch I don't even know how many hair tutorials on damaged relaxed hair, crown thinning, crown breakage, alopecia, going natural...  Now I'm not one for just buying products because someone else raves about it, but along with starting to make my own DIY hair oils and protein treatments, I did purchase a few products that really did wonders for my hair.  A main staple for life is Joico Moisture Recovery shampoo, conditioner, and treatment balm.  But I do have some other faves (Shea Moisture Manuka Honey and Mafura Oil, and Herbal Essence Coconut Milk shampoo and conditioner).  Once a month I also use Aphogee 2-step protein shampoo and conditioner, and after a relaxer (which I do my own), I would follow the 2-step system with the hardcore Aphogee protein treatment.  November 2019, my hair was longer than it had ever been in my life.  I've never had long hair, so when my hair began resting on my upper back, I was doing cartwheels!  However, my crown was still an issue.To try something new, I began watching tutorials on ayurvedic hair care.  I purchased and mixed together some fantastic ayurvedic powders, which, had I used them as a treatment once in awhile, I'm sure my hair would have continued to thrive.  BUT, I made the mistake of adding a nice heaping of the ayurvedic powder to my hair oil that I would put on my hair daily as a moisturizer. After washing, conditioning, and deep conditioning my hair one week after a relaxer, I took the towel off and looked like Bozo the Clown!  My hair was straight but the ends were puff balls all the way around! My hair had never done that!  PROTEIN OVERLOAD!! I was heartbroken!  I gave myself a good trim, but for the next few weeks, hair was everywhere. My bathroom floor looked like a bear-skinned rug. Pieces of hair on the bathroom walls, sink, it was a mess!  Unfortunately I had to deep trim my hair to remove all the damage, which meant cutting ALL of the length that I had grown.  I still have decent length in the front, but I cut the back of my hair even with just above the nape of my neck.  It's hair.  It will grow back.I had been hearing about Olaplex for a very long time and I figured, if there was a time to try it, now is the time.  I let the No. 3 stay on my hair for 30 minutes.  I used a small dollop of the Olaplex shampoo and OMG the LATHER!  Could not believe it!!  After using the Olaplex conditioner, I was hooked.  After the conditioner, I loaded my hair with AsIAm Hydration Elation conditioner and oils.  I'm sitting with a plastic cap and steam cap on while I write this review.For those saying Olaplex made your hair feel rough or didn't work, well maybe that's true, or maybe you didn't follow up with a deep conditioning moisturizing conditioner afterwards.  I know Olaplex is a bond-builder, not a protein treatment, but they both strengthen the hair.  You have to replenish the moisture after this treatment or you may think it just left your hair rough.  I'm now streamlining my wash routine to twice a week.  The Olaplex system on the weekends, and the Joico system midweek.  And while I'll continue to make my own incredible hair oil, that will be the extent of my DIY concoctions.  I already know my hair is capable of growing strong and healthy, and 2 relaxers later, had I not damaged my hair, I wonder what length it would be right now.  But, I'm on my way back, and Olaplex is now along for the journey!!

  I have 3c curly hair I am in transition from dark to very light blonde. This has been a life saver!I apply a generous amount evenly to damp hair, focusing more on the chemically treated parts. I put my hair up and let it sit for about an hour and then I rinse and follow with a deep conditioner. I have done this 2× a week and my hair has been able to keep its integrity throughout my transition.I have even found that my curls are more defined and feel stronger than they did before I started applying chemicals.Please keep in mind that this is not a deep conditioner, but it does help reinforce and bridge the gap between broken bonds in your hair's structure. There bonds are broken any time we apply chemicals and/or heat and the damage intensifies if you are not caring for your hair by giving it the proper moisture and maintenance. This Olaplex will help repair that damage but the stove ingredients do not provide the exact same thing as deep conditioners.Also, think about this before you buy, as many people have complained about the price being so expensive for what you get. If you understand what, exactly, it does and can use it in a system with other products for your hair type and problems then I think you will find that it is a holy grail!

  First of all, let me start of by saying if you receive a product without a safety seal, or you are familiar with Olaplex and the product just doesn't seem ""right,"" definitely send it back. Amazon gets it's products from MULTIPLE distributors, so unfortunately there is sometimes a (small) chance of getting a fake product. However, that being said I am pretty familiar with Olaplex, and the product I received was 100 percent authentic.I had made the mistake of being super impatient with my hair coloring process and did wayyy too much in a very short amount of time. My poor hair was NOT happy. It looked frazzled, poofy, and my color looked uneven/patchy and dull. I was afraid I would have to do a professional keratin treatment to get it to look healthy and shiny again.I had not done an Olaplex treatment in a pretty long time, and certainly hadn't done it on hair that had been pretty significantly damaged. I decided to give my hair a few days break and ordered Olaplex 3 off amazon. When it arrived I had put so many products in my hair to keep it tame, that I knew I needed to shampoo it first. I put the Olaplex on towel dried hair (thoroughly saturated the strands) and let it sit for 90 minutes.I shampooed my hair again with sulfate free shampoo the second time around, and then deep conditioned my hair for 20 minutes. While I was rinsing my hair, I could already tell that it fell so much better. After I styled my hair I was amazed. My hair was 95% better after just one use! I would have been surprised to see it even 70% better. This stuff is now my holy grail hair product. The more you use it, the more it is supposed to mend the hair. I can't wait to see what it looks like after a couple of more washes!My hair is shiny, the color looks even and professionally done since it corrected the dry patchy areas, and it feels so silky. I didn't have to do a 4 hour keratin treatment and kill my naturally curly hair for several months. My hair looks awesome and I feel like the price of this product is 100% worth it. You just need to make sure you are using it correctly. It is NOT a conditioner, it is a treatment that repairs the bonds in your hair. You still have to shampoo the product out and condition after. I highly recommend this product!

  First off, I just want to say that I have never written a product review in my life. But I had the most incredible experience with Olaplex that I had to share.I have always had relatively dry hair, it's naturally very light blonde and I spend a lot of time in the sun and salt water so it tends to get even drier and almost bleached-like in the summer. It got so bad recently that my hairdresser had to give me bangs to get rid of hair that was essentially irreparably damaged. She suggested Olaplex and I thank her non-stop for it.I bought the full set and used for a little over 2 weeks and my hair is SILK. It feels so strong and healthy and its bright and shiny every day and never looks dull anymore. When I let it air dry it's never frizzy and when I blow dry it, it never feels dry. Days after washing, it still feels and looks just as great.Every day my hair feels like I just left the salon. EVERYONE should be using this set!!

    Saved My Fried Hair
  
",5.0,MotherOfDragons,"Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2018","









  
  
    
  My stylist originally recommended Olaplex. Since I don’t see her anymore (trying to save $), when I ran out, I bought Olaplex through Amazon. I recently colored my hair myself and it went very badly. After yet another attempt at coloring and several uses of silver shampoo to fix the horrible orange outcome, my hair was fried. Olaplex saved my hair. I left it on much longer than recommend, but now that my hair is heathier, I just use it as directed. Amazing product. I’m a user for life.

    Amazing product
  
",5.0,JessicaJazNY,"Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2018","









  
  
    
  This product is absolutely amazing! I have very long hair and I have been able to use this bottle for four applications. There is no odor to the product and is easily applied. Your hair must be towel dried when using. Do not use on dry hair or you will need the entire bottle and it will be less affective. It stops working after 40 minutes so the people who will leave it on overnight are not going to see any different result. I tried leaving it on for six hours to see if there was any difference and there was not. Therefore just leave it on for 10 to 40 minutes. I have bleached my hair multiple times and this has really rescued my hair.

",5.0,Naurel,"Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  THIS IS NOT A CONDITIONER. If you still think this product is a conditioner or expect it to perform like one, stop reading. I have been getting my hair done professionally since 2008 and am very conscientious/knowledgeable about hair products/processes. I hadn't been able to find a hair stylist who is multi-talented (past typical hair color/balayage knowledge) and have been to 5 different stylists since May. I went to a different hair stylist for a full set of highlights 1 week after getting color/balayage done that was not done how I asked. The salon does not have Olaplex or any conditioning treatments, so my hair was subjected to 100% bleach. It looked and felt fried. My hair was no where near what I was looking for, so I booked with yet a different stylist for a new full set of highlights, color etc. I knew if I didn't do something to condition my hair before then that it would not tolerate any more chemicals without breaking off. I used the Olaplex 3 for 3 days straight. I left it on for 4 hours then washed with Amika Normacore shampoo followed by Marc Anthony Damage Repair Mask.  My hair looked and felt incredible. My stylist confirmed that whatever I did helped and that it allowed her to spend 6 hours on my hair. I would recommend Olaplex 3 to anyone with severely damaged hair from lightening/chemical treatments. I would not use it more than 3 times per week as too much protein will cause damage.

    Olaplex NO3 is Amazing, & WAS LEGIT!
  
",5.0,Deshawn,"Reviewed in the United States November 4, 2019","









  
  
    
  1st & foremost , This olaplex NO3 is the EXACT olaplex NO3 I purchased from a  sephora store on vacation in Las Vegas✔ The bottle DID have a seal on it✔  & the fragrance & the consistency is the EXACT same IF NOT actually a bit more potent (& I'm not sure if that may be the case  because of the Vegas heat/traveling etc) BUT this is a 👍 thumbs up! I was WORRIED due to other reviews BUT PERSONALLY this was great. ALSO AS A HAIRDRESSER Myself OLAPLEX NO3 is NOT a miracle product, it's ALSO NOT A CONDITIONER is a BOND REPAIR, which pretty much puts a so called ""coating"" on the hair while moisturizing, to keep the hair STRONG when styling to prevent FURTHER breakage , Split ends etc.... it ALSO adds SIGNIFICANT Healthier Hair Luster and Shine. But the KEY to this product working is **READ DIRECTIONS** you HAVE TO leave this in your hair for about 10 mins or longer AND THEN SHAMPOO/CONDITION your hair, its TRULY amazing of the Significant shine✔ movement✔ , Bounce✔ if seen after doing this treatment on MY hair, AS WELL as Human Hair Extensions/Human hair Wigs (which is of course longer hair!) & REALLY made the hair AFTER letting it Air dry &/or blow drying/styling LOOK AND FEEL BEAUTIFUL & pretty much REVIVED. Is it permanent? NO, but just RE Treat your hair! No product IN THIS WORLD ""gets rid of split ends"" BESIDES A SCISSOR Trimming them off! Your hair will be revived with protein and using a decent shampoo (I personally use Schwarzkopf Gliss Fiber Therapy Shampoo) and a VERY NICE Conditioner (I either use NEXXUS OR Schwarzkopf Gliss Conditioner) AND AFTER doing the entire process CORRECTLY, it is Significant difference... some people may look for a BRAND NEW head of hair, NO! But it DEFINITELY REVIVES and you will not regret it! Just use it CORRECTLY and ONCE A WEEK! You will not regret it!

So I got paranoid reading some reviews that it's not real blah blah. So I bought 2 from the Olaplex website and they are the same, same consistency, same smell, same bottle, same effect. So unless they manufacture dupes better than professional knockoffs this is legit Olaplex and you just have to keep doing the treatment until your hair is at your desired health.BTW: AMAZON OLAPLEX ON THE LEFT, OLAPLEX DIRECT FROM WEBSITE ON THE RIGHT

  This stuff saved my hair I went from dark brown, almost black hair to caramel highlights with chocolate lowlights in one day. The first picture shows  my hair literally from one day to the next when I first got it done 2 weeks ago. The bleaching process was brutal, and I was afraid I would end up with split ends, breakage, and hair that felt like straw. My stylist mentioned adding Olaplex to my hair color, so I figured I would look it up and see what it was. That's how I found out about the  #3 Hair Perfecter & decided to order some and try it out. The results were immediate. My ends felt hydrated and my hair was left soft and with very little shedding. This stuff is expensive, but definitely worth the cost if you are someone who colors or bleaches your hair. I simply wash my hair once, then apply it to my damp hair and let it sit for a few hours. I then wash it again and apply conditioner and allow that to sit for a while or overnight. Rinse, blow-dry, press and style, and I am good to go. This stuff allows me to achieve salon results at home without going to the salon every week for maintenance, and enables me to rock heavy highlights without worrying about damaging my hair. I would definitely recommend it!

  This has worked wonders in restoring my hair. I severely damaged my hair with multiple at home bleaching sessions, going from dark brown to platinum blonde. The last bleaching session I did caused ton of breakage. After research, I discovered Olaplex3. It really does work to restore your hair. One thing I will add is that it's definitely NOT a leave in conditioner.

I saw Olaplex recommended on the NBC Today show and decided to give it a try.  It is not conditioner per se.  You wash your hair, towel dry it, then add a small amount of Olaplex 3 to your palm.  Apply the white cream to your hair and leave in for 10-20 minutes or so.  Olaplex is described as ""bonding your hair.""  After 20 minutes, I shampooed and conditioned my hair as usual.  The damaged hair lost the dry, split-ends look and looked healthier.  I dried my hair and styled as usual.  Very pleased with this product.  Package suggestions say to apply 1-2 times a week.

  I started the curly girl method about 2 years ago after flat ironing my hair my whole life.  It turns out my hair is actually very curly - 2C/3A, low porosity, and coarse.  I started using this product about a year ago because it was so heavily recommended across multiple curly girls on instagram.  It was a gamechanger for me.  It helped my curl pattern tighten even more and it really helps undo any damage you may have been doing to your hair.  It's almost like a reset button.  I usually layer it on dirty hair on a wash day with my deep conditioner and let it sit under a hot cap for 30-60 minutes.  Then, I shampoo, condition, and style as normal.  (I do dirty deep conditions because it helps with preventing build-up on my low-po hair.)  It is pricey, I will say that.  But, a little goes a very long way and I usually can go months before I have to buy a new bottle, even using it fairly heavily on a weekly basis.

    A Must Have for Wavy Hair

  I have naturally wavy hair and in searching for products to take care of my trusses I found Olaplex Hair Perfector No 3 Repairing Treatment. I live in a desert climate and the heat makes my hair a little frizzy so wanted to find something to tame it. I dampened my hair, worked a small amount of the Olaplex product through my hair and went to bed. I rinsed my hair thoroughly (no shampooing) the next morning and Oh My GOSH! My hair is super bouncy and my waves are tighter than usual. I have blonde, very fine strands and this stuff doesn't way my hair down like so many other products. Olaplex is a KEEPER!!!

  If you haven’t tried this glaze, you must.  I color my hair and expose it to high heat with the tools I use.  This glaze makes my hair feel moisturized  and adds lots of shine.  I use it about once every 10-14 days.  It’s an easy treatment to do at home and most salons charge at least $25 per application.  The small bottle lasts me about 8 applications.

  Yes, it is worth it! This really works, and has done wonders for my hair. I went to the salon and they overprocessed my hair to the point of frying it. I have used this product twice to fix the damage. I still add my normal products after shampooing & conditioning, and find they penetrate better. My ends still look dry (albeit less so), so I still add oil to them every night. However, when I wake, I cannot help but be satisfied that my hair looks like hair and not hay.***I would recommend watching a YouTube video on how to use this. It is expensive and you don’t want to incorrectly use it or waste the product. Stephanie Nicole has a good segment on how to use this properly and not waste the product (Just google her name and Olaplex). I have tons of product left after using this twice, much more than what even Olaplex indicates and my hair looks incredible.My hair type: Super fine.

  There are so many stories of people talking about how their hair felt like silk after using this, and I can 100% vouch for that. My hair can get extremely dry and frizzy but after using it it’s soft and manageable and doesn’t puff up throughout the day. I’d recommend leaving it on for as long as possible (I’ve put it on right after work at 6, and left it in until almost midnight), because I’ve noticed that the longer you leave it in the better it works. Just a side note though, Amazon is not an authorized seller of Olaplex products and their satisfaction guarantee doesn’t apply. It’s a few dollars cheaper here but the only authorized sellers are Sephora and the Olaplex website, I believe.

I was a little hesitant buying this product from Amazon as opposed to the actual website, but after reading mostly good reviews, I figured I would try it out. I was also leaning towards buying it here since, as a prime member, I got free ONE DAY shipping. My package came the next day and I was a little skeptical. My package looked as though it had been opened a bit and there was no packing slip. But the bottle looked okay and still had the tamper-proof seal so I decided to try it out. I could tell it was the real deal almost instantly. My hair felt soooo much better even before I dried it!

   I'm going to be completely honest. This stuff is no miracle worker but let me tell you. It saved my hair from looking like a solver wire sponge. You all have to be realistic. This isn't going to make your hair feel virgin. My hair was bleached twice in one sitting leaving my hair destroyed: brittle, dry, and horrible. After using this product the first time, I noticed it did something. I smell Olaplex 3 from Amazon and I have the REAL DEAL from Sephora and let me tell you they smell the same and work the same.It doesn't leave your hair feeling silky smooth. For that you need some other product. Try Olaplex 6 and Olaplex 7 they work wonders. But don't expect it to return your hair to a virgin state. It just wont do that, at least not right away. It took me at least 6 treatments with all of the olaplex products before my hair looked less like a wire sponge and even still I need some hair oil.Here is my hair before dying, and then before and after Olaplex treatment. Not the same as my virgin hair but not a wire sponge either.

So I ordered those directly from olaplex because I found out they offered free shipping. The one to the top left on my hand that looks watered down is from Amazon the whiter firmer one to the bottom right is from olaplex.

  Olaplex fixes damaged hair. I’ve used it on my bleached hair and my daughters blonde hair and it makes such a huge difference like no other product out there.  You can have your salon person do the same treatment for about $30 plus tip, or you can purchase this and have at least 6-8 treatments.  You only need about a quarter size (1-2 tablespoons dependent on hair length - ours is short to just past shoulders so long hair needs more).  Leave on for 15+ minutes (hours is fine if you have the time and do not let it dry up) on unwashed, damp hair and then wash and condition as usual after treatment.

",5.0,Osie Turner,"Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2019","









  
  
    
  First of all, I was nervous about possibly receiving a knock-off product. I believe that what I received is genuine, based on the results I have gotten thus far.I ordered this after I severely damaged my hair through bleaching. Certain sections of my hair literally felt like gum. I knew if I combed through those sections, the hair would literally break right off, and some of it did!. I panicked but did some research and ordered this product. I read other reviews/instructions and here is how I used it.1. Wash your hair very gently (because it is already presumably damaged, like mine was) to get rid of any product build-up and oil. The olaplex needs to be able to penetrate the hair, so your hair should have NO PRODUCT of any kind in it when you apply the olaplex. If your hair is clean, just rinse it so that it is wet. Do not use conditioner, leave-in conditioner, or any oils. Just wash it and rinse out the soap with water. (My hair is already so damaged that I don't like the idea of washing before AND after, but it is necessary with this product. So when I wash before applying the olaplex, I will wet my hair in the shower, apply a little sulfate-free natural type shampoo onto the actual hair--whereas when I usually wash, I concentrate on the scalp and just let the suds fall down the length of the hair--and gentle suds the product, then rinse with water. I do this to just get the build-up off because when I rinse out the olaplex, I will wash it properly and I do not apply any olaplex directly on my scalp or roots. This is just another step I take to try to preserve what hair health I have left.)2. Towel dry very gently so that it is damp, not soaking.3. Concentrate the product where you have the most damage. Once you have saturated those areas of your hair, put a little on the rest, and gently comb through.4. Immediately put on a plastic shower cap to keep the product from drying out. Also, this helps use the natural heat from your body to (presumably) assist the olaplex in penetrating your hair.5. Sleep on it! I leave it on for 12 hours at a time.6. In the morning, rinse out the olaplex, wash your hair, and then use a good conditioner.I did this twice, then did a variation where I did steps 1-6 above, but after applying the olaplex and before applying the shower cap, I also applied a hair mask over top, slept on it for about 11 hours, and finished up the steps as written above.(This is my variation on getting the best results, so be sure to adapt this to what works best for you.)The directions say to use this 2-3 times per week for severely damaged hair. I have used this three times so far and cannot believe the results. My hair is nowhere near 100% healthy, but the areas that felt gummy now either do not feel gummy at all, or are about 75% improved. I am pretty sure that if I did not purchase this, I would be sporting a pixie cut right now. I plan to continue using the olaplex 2-3 times per week and eventually drop the frequency when I feel my hair is healthy enough to do so.I've read some reviews complaining about the cost of this product, and it is no doubt pricey. For me, it has been 100% worth it because my hair was literally about to fall off if the wind blew too hard. I am so grateful to have saved it. After 3 applications, I have barely made a dent in the product. I would estimate that I've used maybe 10% of the product? Maybe 15%. My hair would be categorized as long, it is past my shoulders by several inches (but not super long, like not down to my waist or anything.)Other reviewers have pointed out that this is NOT a hair mask or deep conditioner, and it is not. My hair does appear shinier after using it, and it may be softer, but it is in a way that it feels healthier. Your hair will not feel like you just used a hair mask/deep conditioner. It will feel stronger, less frizzy, more manageable, and I have also noticed that what breakage I do have from the bleaching is not noticeable because those hairs are more weighed down (does that make sense?)Overall, I am EXTREMELY happy with this purchase. I was skeptical, reading all of these reviews stating that this was THE MIRACLE product, but I am sold on it now. I will continue to use the product and update this review if needed. I would say that if your hair is severely damaged, the price is worth it, and the product does exactly what it claims to do.

My hair is down to my shoulders and I used about 1/4 of the bottle, so $20 for something that will last me about four months (I only plan on using it once a month), isn't too bad. It's definitely worth the try!

  This product is amazing. I’ve been meaning to buy it for a while but the price always threw me off. It’s not a conditioner but rather a protein and hair bonding treatment. I put this stuff on when I’m coloring my roots. I soak the ends and slap this stuff on generously on the ends of my hair and it instantly erased my split ends and makes the hair stronger. If used wrong it can fry the hair.

  So I bought this on the recommendation of a friend.  She wets her hair and applies and sleeps in it ..with a cap.  I just wet my hair ( hair has to be wet) applied and kept on or an hour making sure my hair stayed damp.  The texture was improved but not to the extent I expected...BUT after using several times. I can now see a noticeable improvement in my hair being softer and less Straw like.  Will keep using... also make sure your hair stylist uses the first 2 steps in this lineup if you do highlights or color.  I told my hair stylist about this line up and she said she had been using it on me.. that is why I always say my hair feels better after I leave.  There is a whole line up of products in this line.  This one is step 3. Step 1 and 2 are for your stylist to mix in your hair color.  Step four and Five are the shampoo's and Conditioners.

  I live on an island and I spend every day at the beach, so my hair is of course very dry. I decided to try Olaplex, even though honestly I didn't have much hope, however, it really worked. I can't say it did wonders, but it did moisturize my hair, it really does look and feel better now, much softer. Whatever  product you buy, don't expect it to change your hair completely, it cannot happen. But you can improve it a bit and prevent breakage by hydrating, so Olaplex is definitely good for that. I would buy it again.

  I was reading about the ‘is it the real product, or isn’t it’ debate. I don’t know because I have never purchased it from anywhere but Amazon. What I do know is that, the last time I had my hair colored at the salon a bunch of it broke off and my hair was ruined. Devastating. I have used this Olaplex 3 three times, and I can already see a difference. The broken ends are laying down, rather than sticking out and curling up. My hair feels softer and doesn’t get tangled up near the nape of my neck due to the breakage. I was very skeptical because every product says it will fix your hair. I actually think this is helping my hair. I don’t take writing comments lightly, and I wouldn’t say these things if I didn’t feel it was helping my hair. I hope this comment helps people make up their minds about Olaplex. When you have fine hair to begin with, having swaths of it break off is saddening. Good luck!

  So I have really dark, really fragile, baby-fine, curly hair. I have to bleach a minimum of 2 times to get the lift I want for coloring over it, but of course when you have the world's most fragile hair type, that's really just begging for punishment. For most of my life, I have been unwilling to endure the level of extreme damage that this does to my hair. There's only so much of my life I'm willing to spend crying in the bathroom with a comb hanging from my head and half my hair on the floor. Now, I can (carefully) indulge.Don't get me wrong, my hair is still damaged as hell. But this stuff REALLY helps. In the immediate aftermath of a bleach, it can take my hair from feeling like wet hay to normal hair that just happens to be really dry. And that's a difference that has allowed me to reunite with my love of colorful unicorn hair. Thanks, Olaplex. Next time I won't be so cheap and I'll actually spring for the Olaplax 1 that you add to bleach, cause if this is what the low-power stuff can do, I'm a believer.

  I've been using this product biweekly for the better part of a year now, and I really like it. I would use it weekly, but it takes 1/3 to 1/2 a bottle to saturate my hair, and the cost of using it twice as often has so far dissuaded me.I wash with a clarifying shampoo to make sure I don't have any lingering silicones or product in my hair that might interfere with absorption, then apply this throughout dampish hair. I usually put it up in a bun and cover with a processing cap to keep it from drying out (since it supposedly stops working once it dries?). I get the best results if I wait at least 4hrs before shampooing, preferably 6hrs. I haven't gone 8hrs+ yet but I suspect it might work even better.After a follow-up shampoo and condition, my hair feels softer and looks shinier. I don't know if it's actually stronger, but it definitely feels less brittle and more hydrated. I haven't noticed an increase in shedding or breakage despite dying every couple of months, which I started only in the last year, just before I started using No.3.Side note, I've purchased No.3 from the manufacturer's website as well. The products appear identical and, on my hair at least, seem to work the same way. I don't have a lab to test the actual chemical makeup or anything, but the products I've received appear genuine on a cosmetic level.

  Just to clarify this product is meant as a weekly maintenance treatment to prolong the benefits of a full olaplex application. Olaplex is a 2 step treatment (hence this product is named no.3). Many reviewers seem disenchanted because they expect amazing results using no.3 only. This is NOT a moisturizing or conditioning treatment either (another misconception amongst reviewers). When used as a full line olaplex is a lifesaver for those who chemically treat their hair. Ideally use it before damage is caused. Adding it into bleach or color prevents breakage. If you're already have existing breakage this will help dramatically. Very brittle hair may take a few FULL applications,  but worth the investment as this stuff does what no other hair treatment can do.

  I love this product it is very moisturizing, restores my hair and makes it feel soft.  I use this after I bleach my hair and it brings it back to life. I also use it once a week when I feel my hair texture changing. But I will say this product change my life and my hair forever. Yes it’s pricey but worth it. Granted I have short hair.

  After a botched bleach job, and subsequent color correction, my long formally healthy hair was in bad shape. I could barely run my fingers through my hair, it was so dry, weak and damaged.  I was distraught at the thought of cutting inches off my hair that took forever to grow long.  Olaplex 3 to the rescue! It really does repair the damage, and leaves my hair soft and manageable.  I use it every 2 to 3 days to keep my hair feeling good and soft to the touch.  I definitely recommend this!

  Horrible product. Every time someone complains about Olaplex not working for them and causing hair loss, there will be a 100 people saying 'it is impossible' as it worked for them. Well, it didn't work for me AT ALL. Caused insane shedding. I got blood work done to rule out thyroid or iron deficiency. I have no medical conditions that have caused this insane hair loss. I had thick luscious hair and now I have lost half of it. I am scared to run my fingers through my hair as it comes out easily and washing my hair is a nightmare. I stopped using it and now after 3 months, my hair is still shedding, though not as much as it did while I was using it. I read in other forums that it takes about 6-12 months for your hair to stop shedding after stopping usage. I couldn't return the product as I started using it only after the return window at Amazon closed. I DO NOT recommend this product.

  I’m a regular user of Olaplex that my sister, who is a stylist, purchases for me with her professional license. She was out of town for awhile and I was out, so I ordered from here. First of all, it’s a very small bottle, and doesn’t last long with long hair. Secondly, it’s WAY more watered down than the product she gets me at her professional store, which means I have to use twice as much. It moisturizes well enough, but it’s honestly like half water, half product. I won’t be ordering this again from Amazon.

  This stuff is amazing. I purchased this because I burnt my hair with bleach and toner recently. My hair just started falling out and became elastic/stretchy. I was hesitant to purchase this because of the size for the cost and I've never used it before but it's worth every penny, this has truly saved my hair. I noticed a difference after one treatment. I leave this on for about an hour though. One bottle I would say should last me a month using it 2-3x a week, and my hair is past my shoulders. My fine, blonde hair feels stronger, softer, less snarly, shiny, and not greasy. I also follow up with redken anti-snap leave in conditioner for extra measure, both smell amazing.

  My stylist turned me on to theses products at my last visit. I am 57 and have thinning, menopausal hair.  It is a little past my shoulders. Whatever this stuff does, it has made my husband actually stop and tell me how gorgeous my hair looks. I have less breakage, more shine, it is fuller and thicker appearing, holds my style which is just loose finger waves to reduce heat damage.  I am now using this product 1-2 x weekly and I have the shampoo, conditioner, and styling creme. You literally only use a pea-size amount of all of them. So the bottle lasts a while. I have not tried the oil as my roots get greasy looking anyway. I am far less self conscious of my thinning hair now. This is a game changer for me.

   See my video for a walkthrough from start to finish.  To start, my color treated naturally frizzy hair was not damaged, just dry with the ends feeling rough and especially dry despite fancy deep conditioners.  I’m growing my hair out To donate again so I won’t Be getting many trims. The ends needed help because they were heading to splitsville if I didn’t do something.Summary is that the Olaplex softened and moisturized my hair and made it feel quite a bit thicker when I run my hands through it.  The thicker feeling hair is nice because my husband likes to run his hands through my hair and likes when it feels fuller, which has been difficult since going through menopause.  Olaplex is not a miracle to transform hair texture or type.  I have naturally fine and frizzy hair.  While it helped with the dryness, it did not transform my naturally frizzy hair. I will have to continue my search for the frizz cure.In before and after pics, the before are on the left.Overall, I like this product, but I don't like the price, so it loses a star.  It is very expensive and unless continued and repeated use has a compounding effect, I don't think I will purchase this again.

  Not sure if this is real or not.  Regardless, I would not recommend doing this without a salon stylist.  Used it once as directed.  It did close the cuticle as it stated, hair shafts felt a bit thicker.  However, my hair had no where for the oil to go that normally accumulates.  So the end result was not thick lush hair as much as greasy hair.  Natural ability for hair to absorb and utilize your natural hair oil is essentially removed.  Will not use again.

  I accidentally over-processed my hair a little bit bleaching and my usual products (Keratin, amino acids, and hydration masks) were barely touching the incredible frizz and limpness that was my beautiful, long hair. Amazon Prime had one day delivery on this item so it was a no brainer: I bought it. I lightly shampooed my hair, towel dried my hair, slathered this crap on, and slept in it overnight. Next morning lightly shampooed and did a repair conditioning mask for 15 minutes (Joico K-pak Color Therapy Luster Lock, my holy grail of conditioning if you're interested, my hair type is thick and straight). HUGE DIFFERENCE between how it looks post-Olaplex and my frizzy puffball from yesterday pre-Olaplex. My hair is 18 inches long and I will get about 3 applications from one bottle. I should note about 5 weeks prior I had an Olaplex treatment done in a salon with #1 & #2 so maybe that has enhanced my results, although Olaplex says you can use #3 as a stand alone and still get results. My hair still needs time to heal completely but this has helped speed up the process by probably one week.

  Nothing short of a miracle product! I went to a stylist to dye and color my hair (no, not box dye!)...something I usually do myself but thought I deserved a treat! Anyway, many friends go to her, I’ve seen her work so trusted her. She knew most of my hair was already bleached under the fading pink. Turns out she used a 40vol bleach, leaving it on too long as well. I never use anything over 20. My virgin roots went from near black to a light blonde so quickly...I said “woah, how’d that happen so quick!” And asked her about the volume she used.Anyway, now i know what that “straw like”Hair is I’ve heard people refer to. Now I know extreme brittle and extreme breakage.It’s never been so damaged in my life ... started treating it with various products that helped some but not much. A friend recommended this, I trusted her and , omg. I’ve only used it once, leaving it on for about 2.5 hours...and my hair already feels like hair again. Still damaged of course, but hair, not straw!! Can’t wait to use it again! My hair is saved!!!——It’s legit (a stylist friend of a friend told methat i COULD buy the real thing (as offered on their website)  off amazon...but to be sure amazon was the distributor)—-Worth every penny—-Is the best product for damaged hair I’ve ever used (and I’ve used almost all of them— all salon grade, expensive, well known quality brands ).I seriously want to write them a thank you letter.

  For my friends with long hair who dive... I’ve found something new!  Remember the last big breakthrough was the Crave gentle detangling brush (i assume its targeted at parents with little kids who have tough to brush hair)Now its Olaplex No. 3Yeah, i thought this was a joke.  Two separate (completely unrelated) stylists were like “use this stuff”.  I was super skeptical because I’ve always been told that hair can’t be repaired and you are kinda stuck with what you’ve done to it (at home I mean, cause i hear there are some crazy amazing salon treatments out there that I can’t possibly afford).  I didn’t buy at salon prices (luckily found it online for less).So currently my hair is X number of years long, mid back, stupidly baby fine, moderately over processed, dyed, bleached, sun drenched, and salt water destroyed.  I’m using the Olaplex 1 day a week (mostly because i only wash once or twice a week unless I’m diving a lot and of course have to remove the salt, but then its just with a conditioner)Results are kinda nutters.  hair in the drain has diminished after week 3, less breakage for sure, and my hair feels ridiculously silky slippery when dry.  You know that feeling that little kids hair sometimes has?  The kind of hair that the cuticle isn’t rough -at all-, so smooth that hair bands just slip out of it?  yeah, that.  For reals.  So yeah, week three, the jar of product is small but I expect it to last for at least another 10-12 applications.  The reviews say that hair keeps improving with each use.Historically by the time my hair gets this long its epically trashed and my hairdresser starts mentioning ‘maybe taking a bit more off the ends so it looks thicker?’, but this time around its going differently.  This time the stylist actually said ‘wow, you hair is better than it was last time!’  Big change 🙂

  I have used this product for years with excellent resultsThis bottle did not work as expected. My hair was extremely tangled and brittle . I could not get comb thru hair. I don’t think this is the real product.

  My hair stylist uses Olaplex when highlighting my hair and before Brazilian Blowout and it has made a major difference. After each treatment, my hair stays silkier and appears healthier for longer. I bought this to do at home to help stretch the time between visits and like the results. Nothing is a miracle, but it is the best I’ve found... especially if you have fine and porous hair because it bonds instead of loading up your hair with residue.

  Not really sure what it is doing to my hair. Have been using it regularly for months. My hair still is very dry and damaged at the ends whee it has been colored the most. I hoped this would fix it but it didn’t. I use it at home, and I use no 2 at the salon when I do my highlights.

    My hair feels worse than it did 25 minutes before

  I read all the raves and thought, why not? Left it on my towel dried hair for 25 minutes this morning, washed and conditioned and air dried and my hair has more static, frizz and fly always than it did before. WTH? How is it possible that everyone is raving how wonderful this is and my hair feels awful? My hair is dyed, not bleached and hasn't been heat treated in over 6 months. Until I used this Olaplex 3, air drying left it wavy and shiny. What a waste of money.

  Get this immediately if your hair is damaged to the point where you're looking into this product! I wish I would have taken a photo of my very damaged & dry hair - it was rough, dry, brittle - embarrassing. I opted to get this instead of the shampoo & conditioner. Very glad, each small bottle is 28$. The Repairing Treatment lasted about a month, washing my hair once a week for that month (I usually wash my hair only once a week anyway).The directions says to leave it in for 10 minutes - after I applied a good amount around 9pm, I covered my hair with plastic wrap, secured with a head band and washed it out the next morning, around 7am. My hair felt amazing! Like silk!!!However - 2 days after the red ring around my head disappeared, I visited the drug store & bought some cheap, disposable, plastic hair covers that I used next time. They did not leave that red ring & I didn't have to hide for 2 days!Olaplex is awesome, I wish it was less expensive - but it most definitely delivers! Order this ASAP!!

  I have been bleaching my hair blonde for 15 years. My hair hasn't felt like hair in 15 years. It felt like crispy straw. I had so much damage that I would brush it, and ends would break off. It was bad. I mean bad. I knew going into this that this was not a conditioning mask or anything like that, so I knew that my hair wasn't going to feel newly replenished after one use.First use: I followed the directions EXACTLY as directed on the bottle. I left this stuff in my hair for several hours, shampooed and conditioned as normal. I noticed that I had less breakage than I usually do. I also noticed that my conditioner did its job better. My hair after one use definitely felt stronger and softer, yet it wasn't fully repaired yet. The bottle does say to use 3 to 4 times a week. This is necessary if you have severely overprocessed hair.I have used this 4 times already and I am almost done with the bottle and my hair feels like hair now. It is so much stronger and healthier, and I am not experiencing any breakage. My hair hasn't felt this good in 15 years. It looks so much better too. I will continue to use this every time I get my hair done to undo the damage. Whatever they put in this works!

    Amazing protein bond fixer

  Like the product says, it’s not a deep conditioner. It’s not going to leave your hair silky smooth and soft. It’s meant to reform the shattered and broken protein bonds in your hair. I bleached my dark, asian hair twice into a platinum blonde. Understandably so my hair was severely damaged and breaking off my head if I even brushed it too hard. So I bought olaplex and I’ve only used it for a one hour long session so far. I’m not kidding when I say after I finished washing my hair, my hair felt stronger than before. Maybe not to its original state but at least my hair wasn’t falling out. It did make my hair feel a lot less crunchy but I can’t tell if it’s the olaplex or the conditioner I love to use. Im hopeful that with another or two sessions of olaplex, my hair would be close to its original strength. For now Im very happy with the results. My hair isnt falling off my head even when Im a little more rough when combing. I dont see a lot of split ends, and Im hopeful of how my hair will turn out with more sessions.

  Ok product, good customer service, however, shipping control leaves a lot to be desired. I receive a bottle that was barely 1/3 full. The company immediately sent a replacement that I received the very next day. Thankfully, this time the bottle was full with a seal. I was disappointed and quite frankly surprised that an obviously used bottle would be shipped to a customer.  I've bought this product a few times trying to give it a chance to convince me it was a great product.  While it was ok, I haven't been that impressed.

  Anything from this company has changed the Hair industry. I have been licensed for 33 years & this is the first product that has been developed that actually heals the hair shaft from root to tip no matter how much you change the color of your hair or bleach it repeatedly like my daughter.  You should use the entire lineup in order to receive the best results. You won’t be sorry. This is an honest review. I don’t normally write them. I realize it’s expensive but it’s worth every dime. For long hair you should purchase 2 of everything.  Now also if you have split ends I would suggest that you trim just the ends off. It is difficult to repair split ends without trimming. Otherwise the hair shaft splits all the way to the scalp. Also if it’s been longer than 3 months without trimming your ends because the product is so expensive you want to ensure you start out with a fresh cut on your ends.
