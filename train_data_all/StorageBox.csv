  The container arrived nicely and secure. It arrived in perfect condition with all 64 small containers perfect. In addition, I also received 64 small labels so I can easily identify what is in the container. The outside container closes with a snap. I‚Äôd highly recommend this product to anyone who needs to store small items, which in my case are diamond drills for my diamond paintings.

  This storage container is really nice. It is compact and easy to carry with you. There are 64 containers. They look small, but actually hold a lot of drills. The tops come off easily to make filling simple. The snap lids are nice and snug. It also came with almost 200 sticker labels to put in the containers.Overall, a very nice product.

    Cute, functional container for Diamond Painting drills
  
",5.0,Rhonda Sato,"Reviewed in the United States September 11, 2019","









  
  
    
  I did one diamond painting without using little containers to keep track of the drills. Ugh! The tiny plastic zip-lock bags often didn't close completely, resulting in drills all over the floor. Since I plan on doing more (ahem, probably MANY more) diamond paintings, I decided to invest in proper storage. I ordered this 64 Grid bead/drill storage container, and I had so much fun putting my drills inside, labeling them with the provided labels. The individual containers hold a good amount of drills, and close with a very satisfying 'click', leaving me confident that I won't be tracking loose drills all over the house.I'm very pleased with my purchase.

  In my hand, joann's box on the left and this product on the right. You can see it's much more clear.Everything about this product is amazing. I needed something to replace my cheap Joanns tic tac bead boxes for my ever growing mill hill collection. The darice organizer seems to be the go to, but kind of pricey. This was a bargain but SO worth the price. The containers are way sturdier and more well built than the Joann's brand. None of them are cracked or broken or cloudy, and the lids all actually fit. I'm not worried about any accidental spills. I was also worried about the labels after having my DMC bobbin label stickers fall off constantly, but they hold on so well! They're not going anywhere. 10/10. I almost fit my 3 Joann's boxes into one, but I'm going to need a second. I just didn't want to commit until I knew it was a good item. I would recommend this over anything at Joann's for beading. If you're using it for mill hills, it fits 3 or maybe 4 packs of petites in one container.

  it's the best thing i have found so far for DP drills. On average, the kits i have gotten use 20-25 colors, and most colors will fit into one of the little individual containers - background colors may require 2 or more if you want to open all your packets while kitting up. Also they come with an abundance of self adhesive little labels for marking the color codes from your canvas.My only complaint is that the little containers do not fit perfectly together, being slightly bigger at the top than the bottom, so they have a tendency to disorganize themselves and fall over in the case if you remove one or two from the grid.Other than that, they do the job they are intended for.

  This box was a limited time only deal, so I bought it and frankly, it's cheaper and less secure than what I've been using. The dill containers are REALLY small (see pictures). I kept thinking they were like the size of a Tic Tac container.  I feel like they will stay shut, but the larger box is doomed to not last long.  I would certainly not trust this to carry drills anywhere. And the handle is worthless.I purchased this to find a better way to store my drills while doing my diamond painting. I was using a plastic set that is like a weekly pill container/4 boxes with 7 rows kept inside a larger plastic box to keep them together.  While I like that product and found them to (almost) meet my needs, the more I used them the more the plastic closing elements both on the small internal containers and the larger, external box is starting to fail staying shut.  Since I don't store back-up drills, I can't afford to spill any in a kit. I felt like I was flirting with disaster and have resorted to a rubber band to at least keep spilled ones in the larger box.  This turned out to be worse in my opinion.

    I don't see these lasting too long
  
",3.0,Rylie Williams,"Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  After completely filling every little tic tac dispenser from just a single diamond painting kit (minus 1 bag as there wasn't enough) I don't see the tops lasting too long since to get the tops off you need to pull on the tabs. Also, 1 full bag fills 2-3 little dispensers. These things are tiny. I also had three containers with large cracks in the side although the crack doesn't go all the way through. I also received several that had smaller but very noticeable scratches. In just one afternoon session I was able to empty 3 full containers. The only real plus to these is the larger box to store everything in and the labeling stickers work very well.  If you do diamond paintings often I would say either buy multiple sets or just save up your tic tac dispensers as they would hold much more. If I liked tic tacs that would have seriously been the better option and the most cost efficient but I don't like them and I can't see me just tossing them either. So overall ....ehhh....

  I adore this container for my diamond painting.  As I often do diamond paintings with over 30 colors, having 64 containers has been great.  I will say the openings are a bit small, so you will need to use a smaller funnel to load the diamonds in. I found the white tray with a spout on the end that comes with some kits was perfect for loading them up. Still, I would rather have a smaller box with more containers, that I can easily carry around then a lesser number of bigger jars.

",4.0,yiota,"Reviewed in the United States August 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is exactly what I was looking for for my excess diamonds.  The little tic tac like containers hold a decent amount.  It's easy to pour them in, it's easy to pour them out.  It comes with little label stickers that give you enough room to write a DMC number and shape on them. You can order them as you get new DMC numbers to add.My only issue is that the larger container seems to have been chosen because you can technically get all the mini containers in it,  but not always easily. So getting all the mini containers in the larger container can be mildly annoying.

  Since the Covid-19 shutdowns and restrictions, I have completed fifteen 5-d diamond projects. All of these were done prior to purchasing this portable bead storage container. I don't know why it took so long for it to dawn on me that opening little plastic bags and resealing was a real pain. Besides, I couldn't see all the symbols at once when I had the vinyl bags lined up back to back. With this storage container I can see all the symbols at once, and there is no trouble getting the containers open. It comes with an initial set of labels easily removed so I can reuse the containers for the next project. This container has saved me frustration and time. I already had a small funnel for transferring the beads back into the container. Definitely recommend.

  I‚Äôm happy with this case to store my diamond dots. The small containers inside work great for my purpose. I can take the top completely off to fill or I can flip the small top open to pour out a small amount of dots to use. They are basically small Tic Tac containers. It‚Äôs nice to have an organized way to store my supplies. The larger case that holds everything does the job. The closure snaps seem a little flimsy and I have a feeling they will break off over time. That will cause me to not be able to carry the case around (like a mini suitcase) without all the little inside containers falling out. It‚Äôs working fine for now though.

  This little sucker is a life saver. Before This I was constantly picking up little diamond painting beads all over the house.

  Likes: 1) these are flip top lid containers, 2) they come in a case to hold them all, 3) the 64 count is better than the 20 count (because when you do several different diamond art paintings you wind up with extra gems), 4) carrying case is pretty sturdy. Dislikes: the lid flaps are flimsy and break off. I just opened this package yesterday for the first time and two of the flap lids broke off, 2) the sturdy carrying case one side of the close lock is not manufactured correctly and the lid does not stay on the latch. I have ordered this very container before but this one seems to have issues.

  By far the best box for diamond art. I have previously purchased a box that had only 28 bottles that screwed on. This box has 64 snap on lids. Can be opened and closed with one hand and since all of the kids are attached, they can‚Äôt be misplaced. Boxes open/close very easily and far superior to those little little jars that can be over tightened and get stuck. Comes with small white stickers so that each box can be marked with the corresponding symbols. The worst thing that I can say is that sometimes you have to hold it by the handle in order to get both sides to snap shut.

  wish I had ordered a couple more. not very diamond painting company uses the same color labeling system so it makes sense to have other storage kits to accommodate those as well. Also, I think I will have to look into log books for the same reason.  I just received this box and have not used it but my only concern would be for sturdiness of the hinges on the individual boxes. With constant use they may become infirm and break off, however I think they will still snap on, just easier to lose track of them if they are no longer attached.  Contrary to the appearances of my apartment I am OCD about matching storage and storage anything. This fills that compulsion. I would recommend, OCD or not.

",2.0,Jennifer St.Laurent,"Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  This item came cracked in 2 places...one crack on the front of the box top which doesn't affect the function of the product, and the other crack on the back of the top near one of the hinges. This crack makes the top of the box hang funny when open, and since the weight of the top of the box pulls at the crack, it keeps getting bigger. The plastic is not very sturdy. I have duct-taped it to hold it together.The small containers for the drills are mostly fine...a few have flaps on top that almost snapped off when I flipped them open for the first time, and they will probably break off eventually. I'm using those for lesser used colors.Had I not been in the middle of a project that I really wanted to use this for, I'd have returned the item for the poor quality.That said, having your drills sorted in containers like these makes doing a diamond painting flow nicely. You can easily pour out just the amount you need for the area you're working on. Just wish the case itself was sturdier.

  First of all, I used this product for a little over a month, and it certainly serves its purpose, especially for the low cost and number of individual containers. However, I decided to upgrade to a more expensive set of containers (used for diamond painting drills) because these containers are flimsy and the thin plastic cracks. If you never remove the lid, maybe they'll resist cracking, but that tiny lid makes it harder to put drills into the container vs removing the lid. Almost all mine have splits in them now, and while the containers are still usable in this condition, I wanted something better with a larger opening for putting in new packs of drills.

  This little organizer was a game changer for the diamond art game! I did my first diamond painting without any kind of organizer aside from little ziplock bags, and that was a little bit of a nightmare, so I upgraded when I bought my next project. It's great for not only keeping me organized while I work, but keeping my mischievous kitten out of trouble. I just have one complaint: while one of the boxes works perfectly, I have issues with the little inserts in the second one. A couple of the containers have lids that are too flimsy to stay closed, so I leave them empty. Not surprised considering this organizer is on the cheaper side. Otherwise, I love how contained and organized everything is.

  I guess I was thinking that the little flip-top containers inside the box were more like Tic-Tac size, but they're smaller than that. I could still fit most of the colors in one container per color, however. And there are a lot of containers, so I could make more than one color if I wanted to (I put my extras in baggies and worked them onto my diamond painting canvas first so I could keep it to one container per color). The included sticky tabs for the numbers is great. I bought a second box so I could have my round gems in one and my squares in another. But because of the size, I'll likely end up buying more. Still, I like this better than others I've seen around the web. I'm not sorry I bought them. :)

  Love this item. I use this for my Diamond painting kits. I was using those round containers before I purchased this and I will not be going back. These containers are bigger and you get more containers for less $ and having the labels included is an added bonus. I will definitely be purchasing more.

  I really like the idea of these containers. I‚Äôve been using them for drills for diamond art. And let me just start off by saying it would be great for a small project and not for a super huge project. Some of the dots like to clean to the sides and it makes it a little difficult when you‚Äôre almost done with the color. As for sturdiness .. I had one that was already broken when I received it (which doesn‚Äôt matter to me) it‚Äôs just a small container.

  Bought this for my daughter, the product arrived from Amazon broken. The clasps to lock down the lid were both broken off and the lid was cracked. It could have been damaged during shipping. The individual containers inside are nice, but would recommend storing them in another container. Even though the damage might have occurred during shipping, I think the clasps would have eventually broke off anyway. Not very good plastic.

  Was looking for something small for vegetable/flower seeds to store in. Each container is study and seals well. I recommend making sure your seeds are well dry or add some silicon beads decadents.  Small enough to fit in a drawer in the fridge if you prefer to keep your seeds cool. I posted this on a Facebook gardening forum.  So, if you get an influx of buys, your welcome!
