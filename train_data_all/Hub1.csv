  I needed to connect 2 monitors to my laptop. This hub has 2 HDMIs and I was able to connect two 34"" monitors to my laptop, now i have 3 screens to work with. I connect the hub to the USB C to my laptop, so i dont need an extra power source for the hub. I connect my keyboard and my mouse to the hub via USB. I have the memory card in the hub at all time, so i can save to it if needed. I would recommend this hub.

    Very good, higher price, lots of ports, Lots of Tests/Stats in review
  
",5.0 ,Christopher C.,"Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  My background: Macbook pro user, not a super user but very tech savvy. Can use more ports on this than most and have tested various scenarios I have run into before.Turns out many of the USB-C hubs are either made by or sold by the same groups (probably both). They are all made in China even name brands. I have a TOTU one that I am sure is made by the same people or distributed by the same people. The TOTU one is the 13 in 1 just like this. They essentially have the same functionality with this Tiergrade one having a USB-C port instead of a 3.5mm jack output. Here is the one I'm comparing and have had for over a year. https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B07Q9JXWTP/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1I don't really need the 3.5mm output on my Macbook Pro (15 inch 2019, i9) as it has one natively. However what I do need is an easily portable solution that has all the ports I need. The main specs for the two are identical and really the difference is the one port I mentioned and the layout.Comparing this to the TOTU it has a different layout with all the USB on one side. The TOTU has a split design where it has a USB 2.0 on the side with the HDMI and the rest of the USB are on the opposite side. This Tiergrade has all USB data connections on one side and the USB PD port on the other side with the HDMI and SD card stuf (basically a power only port that you plug into your USB C power adapter).This layout is more logical in that you don't have to worry about flipping it around to find which ports you need as all USB ports for connecting anything are on one side. The downside is you have to have everything on that one side.It used to be that we worried about usb 3.0 next to a usb 2.0 and RF interference so that could be why the TOTU has that design. I put a USB 2.0 unifying receiver from logitech into the 2.0 port next to a usb 3.0 while it was connected to a hard drive. I did not notice any interference which was good.The ethernet reports in at gigabit connections to my router. I ran a speed test and it ran at my maximum internet connection. I didn't test a full saturation throughput with gigabit ethernet because... well who really saturates a gigabit ethernet connection very often? I doubt I have ever.It does get hot like all the others especially when powered and has multiple things connected.Edit: After contacting the company regarding the second HDMI port flickering they sent a new one. It was still flickering with the cable I used. Re-ran the tests with a different cable (HDMI premium high speed certified) and it did much better. Normal response and no flickering. Moral of the story is to try a better cable when trying to do 4k HDR! With another cable it was fine only through one port. I'd say that some hardware is more picky than others.SD Card transfer was decent. I had a Sandisk Ultra with some pictures on it rated at Class 6 speed (30MB/s). The transfer rate to my Macbook was about 23 MB/s so not bad. It transferred 2.85 GBs of data in about 2 minutes. I'm betting if I had a faster card it would hustle more but I'll leave someone else that test. My faster cards are at the office...Power delivery through the hub is about 8 watts less than the adapter itself. So you can probably guess the hub takes about 8-10 watts depending on what is connected. I tried two different power adapters. One a 90 watt and the other an 86 watt adapter. Both registered 8 watts less when connected to the hub vs directly to my Macbook. This is about normal from what I have seen. I even had a bus powered USB drive connected and it still showed that reading.A few big pros: this has a longer cable than the TOTU and a more useful USB C port which in this day and age is a better choice unless your computer doesn't have an audio jack. But most of the time we are dealing with wireless audio with bluetooth nowadays! It also has rubber feet on the bottom which a are nice touch to keep it from scraping or moving as much. This thing feels sturdy and all the ports work as expected. USB 3.0 didn't interfere with RF for wireless mouse like others have - better shielding.Cons: It's thicker but shorter than the TOTU. It is blue so it doesn't look like a macbook pro space grey which isn't really an issue. The blue is not a bad color just doesn't match the macbook. Must use a quality HDMI cable (Cable Matters was what I used). It gets very HOT... but they all do.Overall I'd buy it but make sure you test all the ports you are going to use with the cable you are going to use.  I contacted the company and they sent me a new one to test. When it had a similar HDMI port issue they troubleshooted that it might be the cable. They were right! I needed another one for my home ""dock"" so I'll probably leave one of the two at home connected to all the peripherals. Thanks for reading!

  Have been using for about 7 months for work and personal. Nothing broken that I'm aware of.Pros:This works great for connecting my 2 monitors via HDMI, mouse  keyboard via USB-A, a micro-usb charging cable for the keyboard and mouse, and charging my dell work laptop.Hub will work when connected to the laptop only. Does not need a power adapter for it's own source of power.  Hub is small.Case and paint is durable. Case is very lightweight.Con:Gets hot when I connect my laptop charger's usb-C cable to the hub to charge my work laptop through the hub.  It does cool down relatively quickly.The maximum power passthrough to the laptop seems to be 65w.  Thus, it won't charge laptops that require a higher charging capability (e.g. 2019 Dell XPS15).The usb A ports seems weak/or does not support fast charging.The microSD card transfer speed is really slow for transferring pictures and videos.The usb-c cable to connect to the laptop is short (like 5 inches).

    UPDATE: Issue was with extension cable
  
",3.0 ,B. Ploskina,"Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I received this today and was very excited to use this with my new surface laptop.  The two HDMI ports work perfectly.  But the USB ports do not work at all.  I even plugged the device into a USB C power supply and it still won't work.  So my USB mouse and keyboard won't work.  I have e-mailed the company and have received no reply hours later.  I was really hopeful for this.  I will update this review if the company gets back to me and develops a way to get this working.UPDATE: I lowered my review to 1 star because it's been a full day and no one has returned my e-mail to the company about the issues I am having.  Seems tech support is non-existent. Buy at your own risk!UPDATE 2 (6/22/2020): I FINALLY troubleshooted (toubleshot?) the issue on Microsoft's Web site and discovered the issue was NOT with the Tiergrade device but with the UCB C extension cable I purchased. Once I connected the device directly to the Surface, everything worked perfectly! I'm still deducted 1 star for such a short-a** cable, and 1 star for absolutely zero tech support. Had to find out this answer on my own.

    No more need to carry multiple adapters to have more functionality of my devices
  
",5.0 ,BravoMan,"Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this USB C hub because I have a lot of equipment that has a very limited amount of ports, especially my MacBook and ultra thin HP laptop. Both of these devices only have a handful of USB C ports and not much else. This makes it hard for when I want to connect an external monitor, keyboard, mouse, and so on to either one of these devices. I have a small selection of individual adapters to provide more USB ports and a way to connect to external monitors, but those adapters end up taking up the limited USB C ports that I have.With this hub I can now connect up to three external monitors, thanks to the two HDMI ports and the VGA port. I can connect up to four different USB devices with the 2 USB 2.0 and the 2 USB 3.0 ports. I can also charge my devices directly through the USB hub without taking up another USB C port. I also like that there is a little bit of rubberized material on the bottom side of the hub. This helps prevent the hub from sliding around my desk or making a lot of noise if it does move around.I also tried it on both my Android phone and iPad and it works great on both. I really like that I can use Samsung Dex on my phone when I plug this hub in, effectively turning my phone into a computer on the go.For anyone that needs more ports on their devices, I highly recommend trying this USB C hub out for yourself!

  I bought this as a present for a co-worker who bought a new MacBook pro which came with no USB ports. This was a great addition to just put into the USB - C and have a lot of different capabilities.I tested everything but the HDMI and VGA as I don't use bigger screens. Everything worked properly, issues I've had in the past with other items similar once connected they would disconnect then reconnect then disconnect over and over. This one the connector for the USB-c is a tight fit and doesn't jiggle around.I rate 5/5

  It is a great hub to extend ports and provide an ethernet.  However, I found the cable to the USB-C port too shot.  My laptop has a USB-C port on the right side. Therefore this sits right next to the laptop giving not enough length of the cable, it interferes with the mouse.  Yes, I use always a mouse with my laptop.  The cable should have been at twice the length so it could be moved away from the mouse pad area. The other option; if the cable is detachable them the user can use his own long cable.

  Solid metal unit. Feels durable. With every port full, it holds up. NOTE TO BUYER, the power is low for the new MBP16 which requires 96W. This one only pushes around 65 W. Also, the two HDMI cables CANNOT be used for extended screens on the MacBook Pro. Each screen on the MBP needs to be on two separate ports.

  This product works exactly as advertised and I was able to quickly get my Samsung laptop up and running with an ethernet connection and two external monitors connected via HDMI cables.  Great for my office set and I now have one monitor running in landscape mode and one running in portrait mode - which is great for multi-tasking and improved technology. It also allowed me to get ethernet speeds vs. WiFi when I'm connected which is nice assurance for Zoom and other video calls.  For my laptop, I was also able to use a USB-C power in (same one that powers Apple devices) to the port so that while this accessory is plugged in it is also charging my laptop (another big plus).  While I haven't yet used, nice to have the flexibility of additional USB C and 3.0 ports for other items like an external web camera.

Otherwise I would have rated it 5 stars.  It sure looks neater than the kluge of wires, dongles, and the previous hub I had before.  This was a very good investment.

  Overall this product is as specified.  It seems to be well built.  The price was mid-range, not the least expensive or the most expensive.  The qty and type of ports is very convenient.  However, the performance is less then I was looking for.  I have a 3440x1440 monitor.  It support s this resolution with one monitor connected.  I have two 2560x1440 Monitors.  When I add one of these monitors to the first monitor the performance on both drops to 1920x1080.  I probably could have figured this out before I bought it.  So I can’t say that this is the manufacturer’s fault (so the 5 star rating).  I just have higher than normal needs.  I did not try the two 2560x1440 together as I don’t have that need.  I did not try returning this product as it is convenient and does support the one monitor which gets me most of what I need.

  I replaced a failing USB-C hub with this one. This hub does more for less money and came with a warranty of one year (when registering with them). I travel, and this is smaller than my cell phone (a bit wider) in a convenient travel bag to protect the device. It's nice to have the ability to connect to HDMI or a projector when needed in case the venue doesn't have the appropriate cables to connect with my computer. It's a bit more than some of the other hubs on the market, and I'm hoping guessing that this one will outlast the warranty - if not, I'll update this and let you know. :)

  When I recently replaced my old 2010 MacBook Pro with the new MacBook Pro which has only USB3 ports, I needed a hub to be able to use the many accessories I‘ve collected over the years. This device is the perfect solution—slim, solid, worth every penny.

  I spent a great deal of time reviewing all the options for adding ports to my new 16"" Macbook Pro.  The Hatowork  seemed to offer all the ports I needed plus some I may need in the future if I want to hook up one or two monitors.  I've been using this device daily since I received it and it works flawlessly.

   Muy buen producto, útil y de buena calidad. La conexión de los puertos usb es excelente y la resolución de la conexión de HDMI a pantalla HD se ve muy nítida. Aún no he probado conectándola a dos monitores, pero a un smart tv sí y funciona muy bien.Lo único que no me gustó fue la indicación de carga, el dispositivo debe estar con carga directa cada vez que se utiliza y de haber sabido desde el inicio, hubiere solicitado un cable y cargador desde el inicio.  El único cable y puerto de carga que tengo disponible es el del docking de mi ocmputador, así que veré pronto como resolver este punto.  Por lo demás todo muy bien.

  Love this product -- no  assembly required (simply connect the USB Type C plug to your computer), its small and compact (which is ideal for my 19-inch wide desk), and it gives you the option to extend or mirror your monitors.I purchased this device for the sole purpose of connecting and extending my two monitors since my laptop only has one HDMI port. Even though I only use the two HDMI ports, its nice to have 10 additional ports just in case.

  This is a great option for an adapter to go with the new 13"" MacBook Pro's, which only have (2) USB-C ports. When you have the power cable in one and an adapter in the other, there aren't any left. This is the best affordable solution to upgrade an already expensive MacBook Pro into a complete workstation - an external monitor through HDMI, ethernet port, SD card reader, but favorite is the additional USB-C port.

    Compatibility Misleading
  
",3.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,Don G,2019年12月8日 在美国审核,"









  
  
    
  The Amazon write-up for this device states that Dell, along with several other computer manufacturers,are compatible.  So I felt comfortable in procuring this device to go with my new Dell computer.Unfortunately, not true.  The owners manual that accompanies the device states that Dell XBS 13/159365/9560 are not compatible (meaning, in this case, that data is transmitted, but not pass-through charging).  Several other specific machines (other than Dell) are also listed as being non-compatible. I emailed the supplier about my specific Dell machine and received this reply: “This usb c hub can not supply power to Dell XBS 13 7390.  We recommend you to charge your laptop by plug in separated port on your laptop.”  The physical setup for this device is a daisy-chain with the computer power-supply plugged into the device and the device's short pig-tail plugged into the computer power input (a Thunderbolt 3 connector, in my case).  The data from the dock is then available to the computer, as well described in several other user inputs—this works very well.  The problem appears to be that the device uses energy (it becomes quite warm) such that not enough is left to power the computer.  The computer will run on batteries, but to recharge, you have to unplug and plug cables.  Or perhaps a second power-supply could be introduced.  I didn't find either of those approaches acceptable and have (reluctantly) returned the device to Amazon.  Note that Dell makes several other computer models and this device may, or may not, work with them.  The supplier (ludtomsupport@outlook.com) answered my email within 24 hours, so a quick compatibility check with a specific computer might be a good idea before ordering.

  Desperately needed more ports and to free up some laptop ports. However, I've noticed an issue...I have two external monitors plugged into this adapter and a third monitor plugged directly into the laptop. I notice that with this adapter, it is mirroring the two monitors plugged into this adapter. Previous to this adapter, I had a different one with less ports but two HDMI ports and it did not mirror the monitors (desired outcome). Because i've this, i'll have to return it as the whole point was getting more ports, freeing up some laptop ports, and keeping my same 3 + 1 (laptop monitor) setup.

  My brand new HP Spectre 360 laptop only has a few ports.  This nifty hub has a ton of ports.  It was just plug and play- all 3 displays (laptop + 2 externals) are supported and the setup was a non-event.  I tried a more expensive hub from a brick and mortar retailer and it didn't have nearly the capability.  HOWEVER, that was the 1st week's experience.  On week 2, I took my laptop to a remote presentation and left the hub at home disconnected.  I used a projector connected to my laptop while at the remote meeting.  When I returned home and hooked up the TG hub to the laptop, NONE of the displays connected through the hub worked!  I tried different ports to connect the displays, nothing.  Checked my drivers, nothing.  Sent Tiergrades an email for technical support and here it is 6 days after and not a word from them.  I also note that the hub came with a warranty card that said I needed to register on line.  However, the Tiergrades on-line website doesn’t allow for registering my purchase unless it is bought directly through them.  So how are you supposed to sign up for warranty protection?Amazon did send me a replacement hub and so far it works fine- just plugged in my peripheral displays and all is good, but I'll have to test whether or not it works after I've removed the hub from the computer for a few days.So I've given TG a 2 star rating based on uneven product quality and abysmal customer tech support.  5 stars to Amazon though, who replaced the product in 24 hours  after TG didn't respond.  Here's hoping I just got a bad hub.  Tiergrades- best man up with the technical support, hear?

  Will be returning this thing. It does not work. got this because I really wanted a docking station for my new laptop. I have a fewUSB2 devices (A Logitech Unifying Receiver and an iPod; I have also tried a few USB2 Thumb drives) that this thing will not recognise as being plugged in. If I put a USBC adapter and plug the devices directly into my PC they work.If I use another (older, smaller) USBC hub that I have, they work. Any USB3 device I plug in (I've tried a couple USB3 external hard drives and a few thumb drives) all work just fine. Any USBC device I plug in works fine. But for some reason, even though it has USB2 sockets, this hub does not recognise any USB2 device I have plugged into it.Without recognising the devices I use, this thin is useless.

    Fantastic USB, HDMI, etc. Hub for Work

  I'm not one to usually write reviews, and I certainly don't write reviews immediately when I get a product. I want to test it out for a while before feeling confident enough to speak to its quality. With quarantine in full effect for a few months now, I can say without a doubt how wonderful this hub is for my home office setup. While my employer one hub for plugging in an HDMI monitor, I have two monitors and it's the optimal setup for my line of work. I'm using this on a 2019 Mac Book Pro, and with only 2 USB-C ports, I can't have 2 hubs plugged in unless one has a way to connect power into the hub.This hub has worked wonderfully for the past 3 months. I'm able to plug in a monitor, my USB dongle for keyboard and mouse, as well as the power cable for the laptop. I can leave my other smaller hub for plugging in the second monitor. Mission accomplished, things work great and have run into no problems that are the fault of the hub itself.PROS: so many ports! Plug all the things. Easy to use, lightweight and worth every penny. I know it's pricier than other hubs, but worth the extra scratch for its added abilities.CONS: It gets pretty warm, but hasn't caused any issues so far. Also, this is probably a limitation of the Mac OS and not of the Hub itself, but I'm unable to plug 2 monitors into the 1 hub and able to use 2 montiors and the laptop screen. I'm sure on Windows it works much better. But for Mac OS, you have to have 2 different hubs, and sometimes it gets confused and doesn't want to display a monitor until a good ole fashioned restart. After that it starts working again. But that's a Mac thing, not a hub thing. Also, there's a power specific port, and if you try to plug your power into a different USB-C port it will not work. Just be aware of that.Overall highly recommend to anyone looking for a high-functioning, workhorse of a hub for their office.

  It appears that my monitors and the USB-C have a mixed relationship.  They appear to have no rhyme or reason as to why they work or do not work.The site has no support options.  I have emailed the company but we will see. It appeared to work fine, right up until the first time i had to disconnect the USB-C. Rebooting, resetting monitors to default, all no go.Connect to the laptop directly and all is well.So, I would say it is a good hub, but not a good monitor system (the reason for my purchase)

    UPDATED: Current item unreliable & doesn't work
  
",1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,WL,2020年4月10日 在美国审核,"









  
  
    
  UPDATED REVIEW:Initially, the product had occasional issues where the external monitors were not being detected by my Windows.  It used to resolve itself after a few unplug/replugging.  However, recently the hub just stopped working where the external monitors are no longer detected.  My other cheaper, single monitor hub works very well so it's unlikely an issue with my laptop/Windows.  It's a pity because I liked this product and needed a hub that supports two external monitors.  I would like to get a refund or at least an exchange as the current item stopped working and at best unreliable even if it decides to work again at some point.--------------------I'm finally able to use 2 external monitors in addition to my laptop.  This product also comes  with additional ports  which is helpful especially given its compact size.  Ability to power the laptop using the charging port on this product also means I just need to unplug 1 cord (this hub) rather than 2 cords (hub & laptop power) when I take my laptop with me. Not a big deal but definitely makes the disconnect/reconnect easier.I recommend it to anyone looking for a  convenient home working setup.

  Overall, this is a great device. The case is metal and feels strong. The network connection supports the gigabit speed of my network (photo attached) and the power pass through port works as well. This will indeed drive 2 hdmi monitors (have not tried the vga port yet), but at least on Mac, the HDMI ports mirror each other (I believe this is a Mac limitation due to only one USB port being utilized on the computer and you can see the picture where only 2 monitors show...the laptop and Tiergrade), this can be useful if you need a remote secondary display at another location...like for clients or in a lobby. I'm not sure if the vga port will also mirror or show up as another display.The fact that this has another USB 3 port and also has memory card ports make this device a winner!

  This portable hub has everything I need to use for my mobile setup. I can work remotely without worrying about not having enough ports. I like that it has rubber on the bottom so that it doesn't get scratched up or move around on my desk when plugged in, not all hubs have this. I also like that it is heavier than other hubs and feels more sturdy and doesn't just dangle and the color is nice too!

  Works perfectly with my Lenovo Thinkbook 14. As advertised, it supports data, charge and video. Currently have it routing all three between my laptop and USB C monitor with no apparent loss of function. Seems sturdy enough when stationary, and stays connected even when moving around although there is some ‘waggle’ in the connection. I think I rod probably tape the cable end and adaptor together if I was using it regularly on the move but no issues for desk use. Overall I’m very happy - solves the apparent lack of right angled USB C cables that support video as well as data and power.

  Ordered these as the USB C connections on the side of the Mac means that cables have to go outwards to the right and left at 90%.  By using these two little USB connector pieces means cables can go straight back reducing strain on them and also freeing up the space next to the MacBook.  Works for both Power and Data, I'm using one for USB C to DVI for an external screen and the other for power.

Tenia un cargador de carga rápida que es una maravilla y lo he podido volver a usar gracias al adaptador.. He hecho la prueba y con el adaptador tarda en cargarse el móvil solo unos 10 minutos más que sin él, que es algo imperceptible normalmente.La única pega que les veo es que se calientan bastante y no sé cuánto van a durar.Edito la opinión porque al cabo de poco tiempo mi cable de carga rápida quedó deformado por estos adaptadores y quedó inservible.

  He comprado estos adaptadores USB-C macho-hembra acodados para cambiar la dirección de salida del conector USB-C de mi portátil del trabajo, un DELL Latitude 7490 que me planteaba un gran problema.Usando una base de expansión DELL WD19 con ese portátil, hay un problema. El portátil tiene la salida USB-C en un lateral, mientras que el cable que se conecta desde la base de expansión es bastante rígido, y la carcasa del conector es grande. Cuando tenemos el portátil en una mesa pequeña, el cable entra curvado y muy forzado (ver fotos). A mi me ha empezado a dar falsos contactos y se me desconecta de las pantallas, pero incluso la carcasa se ha agrietado, pero a un compañero le ha llegado a dañar el puerto USB-C del portátil.Con estos adaptadores consigo convertir la salida de USB-C ""hacia atrás"", con lo que el cable de la base de expansión entra sin estar forzado y ya no me da problemas.Vienen dos conectores, con lo que tengo otro libre para otros usos. Comentar que los puertos son pasivos y son totalmente transparentes en cuanto a las señales. En la base de expansión no sólo pasa las señales de datos sino también las de alimentación de alta potencia y no da ningún problema. Puede servir también para conectar el móvil al coche, dejándole en algún hueco del coche (yo lo llevo debajo del reposabrazos central.Para el precio que tienen, me han resuelto un problema grave con un aparato que cuesta más de 200€ y estoy muy satisfecho con la compra.

  Innanzi tutto, per i dubbiosi e i confusi, il funzionamento è questo:  Micro-USB  --->  USB-Covvero, se avete dei cavi con spinotto MICRO USB, questi adattatori li trasformano in USB C .  Semplice, direi.Avevo già una miriade di cavi Micro-USB che uso in diverse stanze e anche in auto per ricaricare telefono tablet etc., il mio nuovo telefono ha però l'attacco USB-C, quindi per non dover acquistare altrettanti cavi ho deciso di provare a prendere questi adattatori e devo dire che è stata una buona scelta.Il prezzo è buono e, per chi come me ha esigenza di attaccare ai cavi sia oggetti che hanno la presa Micro-USB che altri con la USB-C, questi adattatori sono un ottimo compromesso in quanto consentono di non dover avere cavi doppi ovunque.Gli adattatori si connettono perfettamente e sono molto stabili, insomma, funzionano bene e non c'è molto da aggiungere se non il fatto di consigliarli a chi appunto ha esigenza di utilizzare i suddetti tipi di attacco e non vuole avere troppi cavi in giro.Veramente ottimi.

  Ottima soluzione per chi - come me - cambiando telefono (da vecchio Samsung S6 a un Samsung più recente) si ritrova con un sacco di caricatori smartphone non più utilizzabili. Questi adattatori (il pack ne contiene 6) si innestano sul terminale ""micro USB"", tipico dei cavetti dei vecchi modelli, essendo poi dotati dell'uscita terminale ""USB C"" (tipica invece dei nuovi modelli Samsung). Nell'esperienza pratica di utilizzo posso aggiungere questo => 1) l'innesto dell'adattatore nella vecchia micro USB avviene sempre perfettamente, si incastra bene e non ""balla"" in sede, permettendo la ricarica dello smartphone anche se si sposta o si muove involontariamente il cavo.  2) l'innesto della USB C nello smartphone è anch'esso sempre funzionale, ma bisogna prestare attenzione - a ricarica ultimata - perché l'incastro è così ""efficace"" che talvolta si fa fatica a estrarlo (occorre forzare un poco l'estrazione)

  I recently bought these to replace the charging cable on my Samsung Galaxy S10.  I was very pleased at the cables after they arrived.  I've bought many different types of cables and can honestly say that these are the best of all I've bought.  The braided cable is just thick enough that I don't feel that they will break to easily.  Then the actual ends of the cable are aluminum which was a pleasant surprise.The charge was just as fast if not faster then the factor original cable.  I'm very happy with them and like most I've bought many different cords over the years.  I feel with these cords that might be the last ones I've had to buy.  Thats how good the both feel in product materials and product quality.  For what I was charged for them and quality of them I almost feel they are sold to cheap.  They came in a 5 pack by 6foot on a nicely packaged box.  I feel if your looking for a excellent quality data and charge cord look no further the the Besiva line-up of products.  I think you will love them just as much as I do.I feel in my opinion that these are the best replacement cords on Amazon.  I've spent over $50 dollars in the last year alone.  They are better quality then what came with my new Galaxy S10.

  Esta compra fue bastante riesgosa desde el principio, ya que este hub, comparado con su competencia (startech, belkin, etc) tiene un precio bastante competitivo, pero la publicación y las especificaciones que nos ponen aquí en amazon son bastante ambiguas, en el sentido de que no provee con exactitud las funciones que te va a brindar.MAC OS:- El producto NO ofrece el modo de escritorio EXTENDIDO en MAC OS, como la publicidad lo señala. Solo duplica el display. De hecho solo reconoce uno de los monitores, y el segundo monitor conectado solo lo duplica, sin más. Probé utilizando HDMI y VGA.Mi principal necesidad es usar dos monitores buscando tener todo en un solo puerto, entonces no estoy totalmente satisfecho con esta compra, pero nuevamente, esto ya lo veía venir de acuerdo a la calidad de la publicación, la reputación y la popularidad de la marca, la cual es NULA. Como se ve en la imagen tengo un adaptador de StarTech.com que me da mis dos monitores full hd sin problema, entonces me quede con este adaptador para los displays y con el HUB Tiergrade para el resto de conexiones.- Al parecer todas las otras funciones como los puertos USB 2.0 y 3.0, la conexión de red, carga (hay una observación sobre esto mas adelante), funcionan sin problema.WINDOWS:- Puedo extender los dos displays HDMI sin problema mas el display de la laptop, lo cual me da un total de 3 monitores FULL HD para trabajar, probado en una WorkStation HP con thunderbolt.- Carga la computadora.- Da conexión de red..... La verdad no llegué a comprobar el resto de funciones pues lo que me interesaba era que funcionara en la MAC, pero creo que no tienen problema.OBSERVACIÓN DE LA CARGA:- Tengo un cargador de 65W Apple conectado al puerto de carga del HUB y cuando desconecto el HUB de la computadora, el cargador de Apple hace un ruido raro, como un chiflido, es muy chistoso pero a la ves alarmante, por que al tratarse de energía me da miedo que el cargador se descomponga, entonces cada vez que desconecto el HUB también lo desconecto de la corriente. Esto me parece absurdo y cero práctico.En conclusión, creo que es un producto que da parcialmente lo que promete. Pero por el precio, tal vez es justo.

  O produto é lindo e parece bem construído, super combina com o cinza-espacial do Macbook. Mas pelo preço caro dele esperava mais durabilidade, em menos de uma semana ele começou a ficar muito, muito quente e, depois, não funcionava mais o USB nem o carregamento do notebook. Agora vou ter que ir até uma agência de correios, imprimir algumas fichas/códigos de barra/nota fiscal que a Amazon exige (e não envia junto com o produto) pra devolver e receber reembolso. Não tenho impressora e quero só ver como resolver isso, e provavelmente mais um bom tempo sem poder usar mouse e HDMI no notebook.

  J'ai pris ces câbles pour changer celui qui avait été livré avec mon téléphone et qui s'est rapidement coupé à la base d'un connecteur.Les câbles sont de bonnes factures, le corps est couvert d'une agréable gaine tressée en nylon et les connecteurs sont recouvert d'une bague en métal au toucher très doux.La vitesse de transfert des données et de la charge est bien conforme au standard attendu pour un câble de type USB 2.0.J'ai pu en installer un câble différent dans mon bureau, un près de mon lit et un dans la voiture.Les couleurs des câbles permettent de différencier celui qui fait 1.5m (rose) et ceux qui font 1.8m (gris).Petit plus, le sachet dans lesquels ils sont livrés est refermable, donc réutilisable pour les stocker quand on ne s'en sert pas/plus.J'aurai aimé qu'ils soient livrés avec une attache velcro pour les maintenir plié en lieu et place du petit élastique qui va avec. J'aurai aussi aimé que ça soit des câbles USB 3.1 (Gen 2) pour bénéficier de la charge avec mon petit MacBook Air.

  Suite à un changement de téléphone portable qui possède donc un port usb type-C et non pas un micro-usb comme mon ancien téléphone je me voyais contraint de changer tous les cordons qui me permettait de brancher mon téléphone sur mes différents appareils (ordinateurs,  chargeurs, voiture, ...).Pour une question de coût j'ai préféré acheter ses adaptateurs, et je ne suis pas déçu. Cela fonctionne sans problème. Mon téléphone est reconnu et aucun problème de charge que ce soit sur secteur ou autre. Il faut juste penser que cela fait une prise de 2.5 cm supplémentaire à la sortie du téléphone (la longueur de l'adaptateur). Cela m'a permit d'économiser l'achat de plusieurs cordons.

  Diese Winkelstecker waren bei mir nicht wirklich zu gebrauchen.Es kam dauernd der Ton als ob man ein USB Gerät ab- oder ansteckt.Mit diesem Stecker hat das Laptop den Abgastester immer erst nach aus und wieder einstecken gefunden.Ich habe ein Lenovo Top mit dazugehöriger Dockingstation.Seit ich einen anderen Winkelstecker verwende funktioniert alles tadellos.Aber erst mal den Fehler finden an was es liegt war schon auch recht zeitraubend.

  These cables work flawlessly for devices using Type C. They can charge lightning fast or super slow, all depending on the plug used. Love the 6ft lengths which give you more flexibility to use your device while plugged in. All 5 cables are the same length. The red ones are awesome as they are easy to find in the house since they stick out. Would definitely recommend.

  Bought this charging cable as a replacement for an old OEM cable that I had at work. 100% compatible with the One Plus dash charging block which ensures that I get a similar fast charge at a fraction of the cost of an OEM replacement. There is a small noticable difference in how well the charge lasts on my phone compared to the OEM cable charge but for me it's not a deal breaker.

  L'adattatore è molto comodo per orientare al meglio il cavo USB-C, tipicamente quello che porta l'alimentazione, disponendolo parallelamente al PC. L'attacco sembra sufficientemente stabile, al momento non ha dato alcun problema. Soddisfatto dell'acquisto.

  Ich habe ein Laptop mit USB-C Anschluss, mit dem Original-Kabel hat man aber auf dem Schreibtisch zu viel Plat nach links verschwendet. Jetzt wird das Kabel, dank des Winkel schön gerade direkt am Laptopgehäuse vorbei geführt und es sieht ordentlich aus auf dem Schreibtisch. Klare Kaufempfehlung.

  It's long enough that I no longer have to worry about pulling the end out. I like how each end is protected, making them less likely to fray. The braided cord is more flexible than the plastic (?) charging cable.

  These are good cables. Very sturdy and reinforced at the ends so they don't kink and fray. Also, they are fairly pliable.

  Le câble de mon One plus 5t c'était cassé. Je ne voulais pas racheter des originaux car c'est cher et ça vaut pas le coup. Je suis tombé sur cette annonce amazon, j'ai commandé. Les câbles sont très résistants, bien + que mon ancien. Les motifs sont sobres et sympas. Je recommande
