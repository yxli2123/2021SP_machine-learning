    These rules of power that will get you alone, broke and turn you in to a loser/wanna-be abuser
  
",2.0,Janaka Goonasekera,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2018","









  
  
    
  All ethics, decency, courtesy and fairness falls out of the Golden Rule - ""Treat others as you would like to be treated"". So the question is what happens when we are all those things, for the best of our ability, but we get treated poorly by a narcissist that abuses our kindness. Do we the embrace the psychology of our abuser and accept that is how the world is and that it was OUR fault for being naive?These rules are the revenge fantasy of a wounded child archetype. They are highly dysfunctional in any healthy community, relationship, friendships of family. If you practice them, you will end up losing the most valuable of friendships and other relationships that would have helped you out the most in life, and keep you in that hell.If you want to be able to recognize psychopathic indicators in others, read up some books on modern psychology that addresses that directly. It is not very hard to recognize such people.I heard this is the most popular book ordered in US prisons. That should tell you something.

    DANGER: read at your own risk
  
",4.0,J.S. Bach,"Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2017","









  
  
    
  there seems to be a lot of love and hate surrounding this book, so if you are curious but unsure, this review should help you decide whether or not to buy the book, and how it will impact youFirst, to understand the 48 laws of power, you must know two key ideas1. you CAN NOT escape the power game. thinking you can ""not participate"" is as foolish as thinking that you could somehow escape gravity or make the sun stand still.  Robert Greene explains why in the intro with some excellent examples2. the 48 laws of power are neither good nor evil; they are just LAWS.  If someone pushed a man off a cliff would you blame gravity for for his demise? This is the mindset you must adopt in order to  learn a lot from this book.Things I Liked- NEW PARADIGMafter reading the 48 laws, you will never see the world the same way again. once you understand some of these laws you will see many underlying currents and motives you did not see before.- INCREASES POWERone of the main reasons to buy the book. you wil become exponentially more powerfull by knowing and understanding these laws-CRYSTAL CLEARevery law is clearly outlined with ""transgression"" of the law, ""observance"" of the law, keys to power, and a ""reversal""-GREAT STORIESthe 48 laws are packed with mindblowing and sometimes humorous stories of people in history practicing these laws. this is helpful as some of the concepts are quite abstract.What I didn't like-RISKYan old proverb says "" A man who plays with snakes will eventually be bitten"". If you begin to use the 48 Laws improperly, you could get yourself in some dangerous situations, lose friends, piss off a lot a people, and destroy relationships- REQUIRES DISCERNMENTif you you are looking for a highly concrete book that the says ""do xyz and you will accomplish vyx"" look elsewhere. the Laws require good judgement and and and prospecting nature to practice and apply-NOT FOR EVERYONE If you are aghast at the idea of manipulation and deceit then read with caution.OVERALL: If you want to have more power or a better understanding of why different situations turn out the the way they do, you should definitely read the 48 laws of power by Robert Greene. If you want to be naive, easily manipulated, weak, you should ignore this book and go watch some netfilx.Thanks for reading

  This book has controversy, but most of it stems from reviewers that believe all people are good inside and unicorns deliver their vegan low fat cappuccino with cream. Well, most people aren't kind, and this book prepared me for reality. It doesn't teach one to be self absorbed or evil or a heretic. It teaches one to stand your ground and to protect yourself from taking unnecessary burden, unfair treatment, and manipulation from corrupt people.

  WOW!  I was asked to purchase this book for a client.  Which I did.  I wanted to see what my client was reading, so I ordered the for myself. I read the back cover....I was scared for humanity.  Basically it is a ""how to"" manipulate and not take any responsibility for your own actions.  ""Don't outshine the master.""  WHO is the master?  Talks about victims....so that make YOU reading the book, the tormentor?""Pose as a friend, work as a spy."" I get that we should take control and not let people take advantage of us. But this books looks more like a ""how to"" for wanna be Sociopaths....They should sell this book with ""How to spot a sociopath!""

    Should be called "" 48 Laws of deceit""
  
",1.0,megan,"Reviewed in the United States March 27, 2019","









  
  
    
  48 laws of power are 48 ways to manipulate  people to your will by any and all means necessary. ""Create a cult like following"" give your disciples rituals to perform and ask them to make sacrifices in your behalf"".""When asking for help, appeal to peoples self interest, never their mercy or gratitude"".Strike the Shepard and the sheep will scatter. Play dumb, lure people in with kindness and use it against then later.This book will not inspire anything good. The author gives thanks to others for help in the writing, however this is nothing more than a true representation of Law 3 Conceal your intentions, use people.

    A Book of Evil
  
",1.0,Ludovician,"Reviewed in the United States December 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  This book takes the worst parts of the human mind and drags them down into the abyss. And then thrives there. When you open this book, it's akin to stepping at the edge of the cavern. You don't notice how its stalactite-filled ceiling echo the horrors and the gore and the piss and the vomit of others that came before. Its passages are full of the bodies of good men and women who were caught by the beasts that live there. You know you should turn back after seeing the first mangled corpse, but you're enthralled by the journey. It may come off as exciting. ""What harm can it do?"" you might think. ""There's treasure at the end,"" you might think.Then you see the first demon of forty-eight. It doesn't do anything. It stands, however, at the centre of the first level. It stares at you, its black eyes full of emptyness. You may grow scared. And you'd be right to. Or, like a fool, you will approach this horned burnt skin creature. It stands tall and appears almost as if it were a part of the cavern itself. Its transparent nature, made to lure you into thinking it does not exist, makes it even more dangerous. And when you are well within its reach, it seizes you with its mighty clawed hand and eats you whole. But something strange happens. You don't die. You fall. And you fall far.When you finally come to, your body, full of pain, and soreness, and that horrible feeling of nausea explodes inside you. As if a piece of your soul was eaten away. It takes you a while before you realise that you are now deeper into the abyss. There's less light. But you still hear some of the comforts of nature. The rushing water into the bodies of aqua. The sound of drops from the stalactites. The distant birds chirping. You would think that what you saw was some illusion. That you slipped and fell. Or that some other thing occurred. A bad lunch; a meal that made you ill.  If you were smart, you'd turn around and go home. But most people aren't smart. They keep going.You hear a fox's cry suddenly. You can't believe your ears. A fox? Here? And you follow the sound. When you arrive to where the fox sits, its back to you. You might say, ""Oh you poor creature. Are you lost? Do you need any help getting out?"" Then it turns. It's not a fox. It's not....an animal in the normal sense. The world around you suddenly grows colder and darker. You may take a step back. But the fox, with red eyes, eyes that are bleeding and putrid and full of maggots, follows you. It's screeching. Loudly. And you cover your ears. But that doesn't help. And when the fox reaches up to you, it lunges at you. And eats its way into your heart. And you black out. When you awaken, the cavern is different. As if you were moved elsewhere. The walls are growing a faint red. Your chest feels like it's on fire. And you can't feel your arm. But it slowly begins to regain its feeling. Then you puke out blackness. It's not a puke like anything you've seen. The human body isn't made to expel something like this. Something is clearly wrong. That was the second demon. You might panic and run. Or you might not. If you were smart, you'd turn around and go home. But most people aren't smart. They keep going.You rub your head, then your arm. You get up to your feet and look around. Things seem hazy. Much darker than before. You're confused. You don't know what you saw. You look around. Maybe try and find a way out. Suddenly you see a light at the end. You decide to follow it. And you spot an old man sitting on a small mound. He had a long flowing white beard, a grand white gown with the names of holy people written and he wore a crown. Much rather, he wore seven crowns made of gold, silver and copper,  and each crown was full of diamonds of various colours and shapes. His eyes were gentle. And smiled, like a father does to his child. His presence gave off something warm about it.""Who are you?"" You might ask.""I am the last of all that is good. Turn ye back and never return. Ere thou too shalt be consumed,"" the mysterious fellow said, in a loud and booming voice. You might think the old man mad, others might think the old man illogical, and finally others might say that he's ignorant or outdated or that he can't understand the intricacies of the new world, the modern world. He is a relic of the past, with all those pesky morals and traditions. We can't have morals or traditions in the future.If you heed the advice, you may yet be saved. If you don't, then your soul will slowly be consumed. Until you too are no different than the demons you should rightfully fear. Even if you were not a religious person, it would be obvious to see how unethical this book is. You will become a spawn of evil. And no amount of prayer and church-going will ever be enough. Because you have been done the unforgiveable knowingly.If you wish to learn how to use power for good, then I would recommend Aquinas's De Regno, Vincent of Beauvais's The Education of Noble Children, Cicero's De Officiis, Seneca's De Clementia, and the King's Mirror by anonymous. There are many more on the observation of power and its use in business, but these work. And you don't need to be underhanded in order to do so. The best businessman is the one who can keep his soul intact, and thinks of the good of others. Not himself.

    Great read, from start to finish!  Thanks, Robert Greene ;)
  
",5.0,EJ Lohbeck,"Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2016","









  
  
    
  This is a controversial book, mostly because the average person wishes the world were peaceful, friendly, and not full of chaos and drama...Well, unfortunately, wishes don't make it a reality, and there are people out there who prey on the weak and take advantage of those who are too trusting.  The 48 Laws of Power (by Robert Greene) illuminates many ways that those predatory people can gain power over anyone who is not aware of the manipulation and power games they play.  And while it may take some practice, study, and a keen eye for detail, anyone can learn to spot these (often subtle) power struggles and often even turn the tables on the enemy at hand!Please, if you are considering reading this book but are 'on the fence' about it because of the people saying negative things about it, just read it!  This has become one of my favorite books in a short period of time, and it has given me a new way to perceive the world around me.  Robert Greene is a great author, and the way this book is formatted / written makes it educational, entertaining, and compelling, all at the same time.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend it to every single person in the world, because it is not for the faint of heart; but if you've ever been taken advantage of, shut out of someone's life, lost control of a situation, had someone feign authority over you (successfully), had relationship problems, problems in the workplace, etc, you deserve to give this a read-through at LEAST once.  Don't take everything at face-value... and by that I mean don't decapitate anyone for ""transgression"" of any of the laws, but definitely think about times you have seen these laws at work, and how a grasp on a relevant law from the book could have changed the outcome of that particular scenario..Long story short, this is an amazing book!  I hope you enjoy it as much as I did!  :)

  No one needs to know how to form a cult. The books explains how, in broad strokes. If that doesn’t prove this book is intended to entertain I don’t know what would.The rest of the stories, they are stories loads of great stories, teach us how to identify predators, defend against them and gain confidence when dealing with any problem people.I wish I’d had this book in college. Just knowing how to undermine clinging leeches would have been worth the price.If you’re afraid the book teaches how to use and abuse you can relax. There isn’t enough detail for that. This book teaches how to identify users and their primary methods and motivations in story format that are laugh out loud funny sometimes and insightful at all times.I recommend it to anyone but particularly people who have trouble dumping takers.

  This book teaches you about your ""Power"" and how to recognize it in everything you do, especially your profession.  It teaches you humility and humbleness and how powerful that is when it's applied.  I have two other books in this series and am in the process of reading them all.  This particular book does not need to be read cover to cover.  You can read on the ""48 Laws"" as they interest you, not only as the book is written.

    A Manual for Narcissism.
  
",2.0,Ritu K.,"Reviewed in the United States March 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  The two stars I am giving this book is because it DID teach me how power hungry people behave and what manipulation tactics they use. So, this book is invaluable in that it clearly lays down for people who have been on the receiving end of bullies, narcissistic people and manipulators, exactly what tactics they are using. So, while this will disturb you to the core, please read it if you been taken advantage of people like these in the past. For Self Defense and Awareness Purposes solely. Now that I have said that, this is a highly disturbing read. Yes, many power hungry people do behave this way. Yes, this is the REALITY of how people and institutions around the world manipulate and push people with less people around. But the author seems to be condoning them. I was deeply disturbed by this book and the author's ""voice."" If they meant this as an impartial study of reality (sad and depressing as that is), that is NOT how this comes across at all. In fact, I think a lot of the people who will be attracted to this book will be power hungry, narcissistic or outright narcissists. And this book is a manual that will help them hurt other people. And the rest who stumble across this book will probably be disgusted by it and shrink back. But to those, I say: Read this book as self defense. I am not sure what exactly the author intended by writing this book but we can use it to defend ourselves against predators. The next time you come across someone at work or at home whose power moves you just don't understand, look at this book. They are probably using one of these tactics that normal, decent people (which I think most, or at least, many people are) just don't use. This is truly a manual for how to become a narcissist.

  I've tried to read this book for almost 4 months now, have restarted it twice after losing interest entirely and it feels like a chore to read. It's like the author read Art of War, took something hallucinogenic and then went to writing. Perhaps in politics some of this may apply. But if you implement even half of what this book advises, you will succeed only in becoming a psychopath and push everyone around you away. Any time I've been seen reading this book and people ask what it's about, I have no idea what to tell them. Despite reading and re-reading and re-analyzing the first 19 ""laws"" I cannot understand why this book makes lists with so many great ones that you might actually get something from. There seems to be a culture in literature of garbage like this where people pretend to ""get it"" and that laws of ancient wisdom involving trust and decepit and military tactics somehow improve their life working 9-5 in an office, sitting on a computer all day. I personally have gained nothing from this book in spite of spending probably an accumulative 20 hours reading it thus far.This book will now make a very short list of mine, a list of books I absolutely could not get through and wound up discarding:-Love Yourself Like Your Life Depends On It-The 48 Laws of Power

  While this book is a useful compilation of historical stories, it dangerously also poses as a modern manual for human behavior - a task at which it abysmally fails. We have the book on our coffee table and open it any time we need a good laugh. Anyone looking to understand human behavior, power dynamics and network effects would be better off reading books based on research and modern science, since we no longer live in the dark ages. Adam Grant and Brenee Brown are good starting points.

    Guide to Survive Dog-Eat-Dog Corporate America
  
",5.0,Ramblin' Man,"Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  This book is a must for anyone working for the corporate leviathans of our age.  The scholarly  research for this book is immense and impressive.  It contains more non-fiction anecdotes from over thousands of years of human history than any book I have ever read.I graduated college in engineering in1996 right as the treasonous two decade plus mass movement of plants and entire industries began in earnest  to China and Mexico.  As millions of American jobs have been lost, dwindling work forces have been fighting like junkyard dogs over scarce resources.I was naive and tended to believe the best in people as I was born and raised in a small and relatively isolated enclave in Southern Appalachia.  The last 24 years of Hard Knocks has made me a different person.  I have been betrayed, knifed in the back, shut out by cliques, blind-sided publicity, etc.  Nobody is after me in particular but absolutely EVERYONE is looking out after number one and don’t care who goes down in the process.  Humanity has not changed over the millennia!I have unwittingly learned some of this book’s techniques over the years and have been a survivor of many mass layoffs that were inflicted on the workforce (during times of record profits I might add in case you might want to argue the business  necessity of the firings).  I am not using this book as a climb to the top as the upper echelons are much less secure and overrated than many tend to believe.  Being a manager in a giant global conglomerate is like being the head football coach of a team where you control nearly nothing yet have all the responsibility for success or failure.This book teaches survival.  I reject that these principles are amoral.  They are true reality.  The folks who are pretend religious with Jesus coffee mugs and Bibles on their desks will put a thousand working families on the street if that’s what it takes to get their own personal bonus for the year.  That’s just the way it is.Take what you need from this book and sweep the rest under the table.  Use the principles according to your needs, organizational structure, market conditions, and personal strengths.  I wish I had this book when I graduated college but would not have paid attention to it.  I was full of optimism and Pollyanna positive thinking.  The harsh reality of how the world works has set in and this book is a nightly reader for me as a result.

    It's A Doggy Dog World, Will You Fall Behind Or Thrive In It?
  
",5.0,Phoenix9,"Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2016","









  
  
    
  Many of us are told growing up that the world is a utopian place and to adjust our behaviors accordingly. We told to ""treat others how you want to be treated"", ""turn the other cheek"", ""everything happens for a reason and works out in the end"" and ""pardise awaits us after we die"".Most people realize that this view of the world, especially once they leave the nest, is in fact false. There is suffering and death occurring on scales at the moment that are beyond human comprehension (nature has a 99% extinction rate). People are, and quite willing, to hurt and use you for their own ends. And that if you expect to get anywhere in the world you have todo more than work hard and be kind, you must hustle, be lucky and sometimes use and push people aside.Robert Greene in ""The 48 Laws of Power"" is first and foremost making you aware of the way the world is. Not as we want it to be but as it is. He goes through 48 ""laws"", which are really just techniques/actions, that people use to protect themselves, advance their own interest and ""gain power"". Each chapter starts with short description of the law and then proceeds to detail the law through accompanying stories and reasoning.Overall I feel the author has created an absolute masterpiece. He's engaging, articulate, funny and smart in his writing. Personally once I really got into the book I couldn't put it down. I found myself reflecting back on my own experiences, those close to me and society at large and I saw people utilizing the laws all the time (whether they know they are is a different story). I was also suprised, in a good way, at just how diverse and applicable they were to so many different areas of your everyday life.The only real downsides I found with the book is that it is long (probably unnecessarily so) and a bit depressing (since the laws can and often are used for evil). But that's a complaint about human nature, not the authors fault.So what is the real purpose of the book, what do people take away from and use it for? Well the laws are really just like a diverse tool kit to be used at different times in your life. So first and foremost it's about awareness and protecting yourself. Even if you don't use the laws, or at least don't intend to use them in a bad way, other people will try to use them on you and you can adequately defend and protect yourself. As they say ""a ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" to any problem/conflict.Second it's about using them to advance your own interests. And this where the negative reviews are entirely unwarranted. Any weapon or tool, such as a car, is not itself good or evil. Only the person wielding it is. So you can use them for good or evil. And at the end of the day really is their anything wrong with protecting and advancing you own interests (if they are noble)? The answer is no and if you want to do anything meaningful in life you must both defend and attack.Another thing, for those still hesitant on reading the book, is this. In recovery from any major problem there is typically five steps people go through (whether they know they are going through them or not). They are ""Denial"", ""Anger"", ""Bargaining"", ""Depression"" & ""Acceptance"". This is what you will likely go through with this book. At first you'll ""deny"" the laws, you'll become ""angry"" as you see that they are in fact true and be utilizing people (how awful they are for doing so), you will start to use them for yourself and see results (""Bargaining""), ""depressed"" as you come to terms that they really work and used for evil in some cases (why does it have to be this way) and lastly you'll ""accept"" that this is just how the world works and your better of knowing about them and using them for both defense and offense.Do you want to be a victum the rest of your life and be used, abused and hurt and left behind? Or do you want to Man (or Woman) Up to the world so you can survive and thrive in it? The answer is obvious. I have seen people, including myself, get used, abused and hurt (in some cases ending in death) because they were unaware of these laws or refused to let go of the utopian/disney view of the world. Grow up or get left behind.As Saint Paul said ""When I was a child, I spoke as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child; but when I became a man, I put away childish things."".I would recommend you check out Greene's other books in particular ""The 33 Stratgies of War"" and the ""The 50th Law"" (with 50 Cent). The help complete your personal technique arsenal for effective defense and offense.My last piece of advise is to follow the unwritten ""49th law"" which is ""to not talk about the laws of power"". It is to your advatge for others not to know this stuff as they will often use it agaist you or they will resent you because they may think your using it on them. (This is the real motivation behind a lot of the negative reviews, they don't want you to know them because they put themselves at a disadvantage). I would only educate perhaps your children and a long term significant other as you want them to be protected and thrive as well. However if you can be sure you safe from harm you may want to pass it on (as someone likely did to you since your reading this review). But again be wary, when so many other people suck it makes it easier for you to stand out. As they say a good magacian never revels their secrets.

    Good for detecting users, losers and demons.
  
",3.0,Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2021","I'll be honest, this book is gross. It basically teaches you to victimize people. Look, I'm a tough person. I am happy in my life as well. I am no spring chicken.

So please hear me out- I thought the negative reviews would be just sour wimps with no real world experience. I do have that real world experience, I'm 25+. I imagine this is a very popular book with young men in high school and early adulthood, because I was thinking... Did someone give these guys a manual? How do so many people have personality disorders or lack morals? Probably not all the credit can be given to this book, but we've ALL felt the creepy sinking feeling when somebody tries one of these things on us.

I didn't like the advice in the sense that I definitely will not follow it, bit I will glean tidbits of red flags instead of just having NO idea of what is going on when I have a person, be it coworker, date or ""friend"", who takes an action that gives me an uncomfortable feeling. My favorite dating book even mentions this- that men will probe you looking for personal information to use against you in the first few dates or months of dating. I can definitely identify emotional abuse tactics in here. And I grew up in Florida with the alligators, I'm not a snowflake. I understand not everything is ""toxic"". But the advice in this book is just that! For example- he recommends ""testing"" people to see their response before you con them. I refuse to con anyone. Sure, I like to leech free stuff off my dad, but that's the extent of my conning loll.

Although, I would much rather be pissy and disenchanted with a book then to BE CONNED in my life. This book, in my opinion, has ONE use: identifying losers, users and con people

I don't want a man in my life if he frantically refers to what can only be described as an emotional abuse manual.

However, I recognize the desire for power is a healthy male desire. Many men of faith and family choose to become powerful in business and raise a family, lead in their community. I think that's a healthy expression of power. Not conning people.

In a way, I almost felt bad for the author. I mean seriously, after the advice he will tell you ""what the person's reaction means"". In my opinion, this is the most dangerous part of the book (for a well meaning reader), because there's nothing more of a turn off to a woman than to have some slick sleazy sinking feeling around a guy. Ladies, don't gaslight yourself into believing you have *anxiety* because I guarantee there are a number of slimy demonic guys out there using their abuse manual to get what they want. In the past, I used to feel obligated to ""give a guy a chance"" until I had some kind of visible proof he was up to no good. I guess this book can serve that function too, helping you to identify covert maneuvers instead of second guessing your intuition.

The reason that's the most dangerous part is because this guy has no idea what people are thinking. His PRIDE is so great he is blind. He assumes that if someone responds positively to your moves, they must be an idiot, or a ""mark"". He also has several mentions of ""if the person reacts this way, find a new victim"". He explicitly encourages people to take advantage of kind, loving people and calling them ""suckers"" too. Totally demonic. Wouldn't you rather take advantage of the looney tunes person rather than the kind man who cares for his family? You know what I mean? Kindness is not ""weakness"" and a kind man can still be a strong, powerful man.

This is the thing: the vanity and the pride of assuming you are some grand manipulative wizard, some omnipotent manipulator beyond detection... Not only is it sinful and all sin leads to death, but it's just so unappealing and arrogant.

I once said something similar to a young man who s*xually assaulted me in my youth. Once I recovered, I said to him ""why do you choose to r*pe people? You are a handsome guy, if you acted like a decent human being you would get laid all the time. You wouldn't even need to r*pe""

That's the thing, blindly stealing what you want from people and laughing about how ""stupid""they were to fall for it... It's just demonic. You can get what you want without evil tricks..

JESUS is the only true power. I can just imagine the Jordan Peterson superfans scratching their peach fuzz right now. ""Wow, she must be SUCKER, don't you know religion is a cult I read it in my Power book huehuehuehue""

THE DEVIL IS A LIAR.... if you buy this book (don't spend more than ten bucks), don't use it as a manual. That can only lead to despair, rejection and destruction. If you get the book, skim through it to identify tactics users and abusers will use against you. Ultimately, this book explains the gross feeling you get in your stomach when someone is using you. I like other books like ""the gift of fear"" and ""how to spot a wolf in sheep's clothing"", but this book gets at the HOW not WHY like those books. What EXACTLY is causing the lump in your stomach when a new boyfriend is prying about your bad childhood, even if he seems supportive at first? Not all that glitters is good. TRUST your gut. READ the Bible, the Word of God. Then skim this book.

Using this book for yourself will only lead to destruction.

Jesus said not to be OF this world, but IN it. One of these pages actually suggests to ""keep the spirit of the times"". I guess this book was written long before the dumpster fire that is 2020, but that's horrible advice. It was saying to not be outdated in your spirit or presentation, which I can somewhat agree with. Fedoras and acting like you are currently in the 50s is cringe. But to change your spirit to conform to the world? That's advice I will not be taking.

For all you skeptics, God has blessed and protected me thru many demonic attacks through people like the ones he describes in this book. I strongly believe Jesus is the only way and I would rather have a spirit of peace and trust in the Lord (combined with a healthy confidence and trust my gut) than to have some ""here's to screw people over"" book.

If you want to destroy your life, go ahead and take the book advice. People aren't as stupid, naive or gullible like this author seems to think. In fact, I've had multiple people try to take advantage or harvest information that is none of their business, and deflected it successfully just by trusting my gut and God. But if you bulldoze thru life taking advantage, don't be surprised when your life is a dumpster fire, nobody trusts or likes you because THEY feel uneasy in their gut (people cannot be gaslighted long term, they Will Find you out, especially women with their women's intuition), and you have a heart attack at age 56 alone in your apartment. I'm serious! This book is terrible, but useful to detect narcs and psychos and even insecure normal people who went down a path of sin.",

    A timeless classic less known than the Art of War
  
",5.0,Su Doki,"Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is not a novel to be read in 1-2 days. It is a philosophy about power that is reduced to 48 rules for practical use. The language is simple, direct, and easy to understand. But like all philosophy, read a little - spend a few days or weeks thinking about it, then read some more. Perhaps the best quality about reading this book is you will begin to recognize the types of power (rules) occurring in your life and the lives of others, in real time.I'm surprised by the many reviews that caution potential readers. This book is no more dangerous than reading the Art of War. Power always surrounds us and is used as naturally as breathing air.  Sometimes we call it persuasion, negotiation, networking, or tantrums - like from 2yr olds who try to get their own way. The point is power is always present. So, is it better for you to know what is power, how it is used, and to learn how to use it yourself, or to remain somewhat victimized by those who do?  Power, alone, is neither good or bad.Robert Greene, the author, has taken a lifetime of learning by trial-and-error in the school of hard knocks (sometimes more like roadkill) and put it into a book meant for casual reading for common people. I can think of a lot of things that cost less than $20 and life isn't one of them. Don't be afraid to read this book. The worst that can happen is you learn a little more today, than you knew yesterday. But no matter what, your character and what you choose to do in life is a conscious decision. Will you make that choice or give that power to someone else? Don't answer until after you have read this book.

    Unlawful laws?  A good book for bad people?
  
",5.0,William J. Bahr,"Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2021","









  
  
    
  Almost like a certain biblical tree, this highly popular book impresses me as almost akin to the “Book of Good and Evil,” maybe even a close cousin to Machiavelli’s “The Prince.”  As I read through this 452-page collection of 48 power laws, I personally rated them into the following categories (one law was split):  Good (27%), Bad (30%), and Ugly (43%, which could go either way to follow the crowd).  As far as archetypes, one could translate this split into a good George Washington, a bad Hitler, and maybe a run-of-the-mill, somewhat unprincipled modern politician. Also, some of the laws looking to be Bad on the surface appear to be just Ugly, given that the examples of the law subsequently provided soften the apparent top-level advice to do harm.  And some laws seem to contradict other laws, leaving one wondering which ones to follow.Yes, these strategies are said to work to accrue power, but to what end?  Are you trying to build up a positive world for everyone, or raise yourself up while destroying it and hoping you’re dead and gone before it comes crashing down upon you and everyone else?As you may recall, Machiavelli’s “The Prince” is one of the first works of modern political philosophy, purporting to share “the truth” rather than ideals.  The term “Machiavellian” is now viewed as a pejorative. However, if one recalls George Washington's words, he frequently used the word “interest” to determine how people and peoples (nations) are motivated. Indeed, even Machiavelli urged princes to construct compelling arguments. Thus, power is always and ultimately about persuasion, whether convincing others to work with you or to explain to adversaries the consequences if they do not.  Addressing “interest” then is frequently just a “carrot and/or stick” proposition.However, on the positive side about the book’s negative side, at least it helps one with Good character learn about what Bad characters might try!  Therefore, all in all, I highly recommend even Good guys take a tasteful bite of this good/evil book!Of possible interest:

    Laws that are Chock Full of Contradictions
  
",2.0,Everett,"Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  48 Laws of Power is a classic snake oil book. It claims to have Laws, but each chapter points out the swathes of exceptions to each Law. Furthermore, the laws blatantly contradict one another. The result is a book full of anecdotes attempting to prove contradictory rules. The book instructs the reader to be a cutthroat, emotionless, calculating manipulator to succeed. I will not argue with that conclusion, but it is not the only path in life. For fun, here are some of the 48 laws that contradict one another:Law 6 - Court attention at all cost (""all attention is good attention"")Law 5 - So much depends on reputation - Guard it with your life--------So he advises to bang pots and pans together, but to avoid getting a bad reputation. Great.Law 7 - Get others to do work for you, and always take the creditLaw 11 - Learn to keep people dependent on you--------In other words, sometimes you should make people do all the work, and sometimes you should garner a reputation for doing all the work and being reliable. Great advice.Law 4 - Always say less than necessary (to appear smart by letting people imagine you know more)Law 46 - Never appear to perfect-----------So you should pretend to be omniscient but not perfectly omniscientLaw 34 - Be royal in your own fashion: act like a king to be treated like oneLaw 38 - Think as you like but behave like others-----------Unless everyone is a king, this is plainly absurd.Before you buy this book for laughs, keep in mind that if you follow these rules, smart people around you that read similar concepts as a defensive measure (like myself) will immediately write you off as a sociopath that is not worth connecting with, befriending, or respecting. Power is not the only value in the social marketplace.

    Don’t Get Suckered
  
",1.0,PD,"Reviewed in the United States November 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  I must admit, I am a little embarrassed of having bought this book.  After the first 11 “Laws” it has become clear to me that I was suckered.  The very idea that there could be 48 “Laws of Power” is really laughable if you think about it.  But, still, one might hope to get something profound out of it.  This work could far more appropriately be labeled “How to Be The Biggest Jerk in Any Room” or maybe “48 Fairy Tales of Power.”The authenticity of the stories presented I find very suspect.  They often read to me as loose collections of facts strung carefully together in a manner advantageous to the author.  There are no footnotes indicating any sources to investigate.  There are quotes from Sun Tzu and such that I am reasonably sure are perfectly legitimate.  But to pull concepts together in this manner strikes me now as disingenuous to say the least.If it is true that this book was banned in several prisons, that likely isn’t because of any ‘secret’ or ‘utterly profound’ insights.  It is probably because some of the inmates might actually believe this garbage and get themselves or others killed.There may be scattered insights here and there into human psychology depending on your background.  And there may be some value in reading this just for entertainment.  But please do not buy this book thinking that it is academically legitimate in much any sense.

    the ultimate POWER is knowledge
  
",3.0,Stephen M. Fragale,"Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2018","









  
  
    
  I struggled whether to give this book 3 or 4 stars but ultimately I enjoyed the stories and history lessons but was annoyed by all the authors interruptions with side notes and comments and interpretations. I think the stories and histories in the book were strong enough on their own and didn't really require so many interjections.I know this is a book about POWER and it's a part of human life and interactions among humans but the author paints a rather negative and depressing picture about humanity. Surely there are other emotions and qualities that we posses and that motivate us besides this lust for POWER and the need to deceive and if we are to believe the author all our motives and desires are tied to this need, lust for POWER. I would maintain that the human condition is much more complex than that and there is an influx of motivations and emotions that are in play in all of us and that POWER and the need or desire for POWER is only one of many. Many of the historical examples depict murder, lies, deceit, robbery, criminal acts, etc. Again, this is part of humanities history and surely there is much to be learned from this history. But would I want to model my life after any of these people? Probably not. Doesn't it mean i'm in denial about my so called need for POWER? I don't know...maybe? To me the ultimate POWER is knowledge. Learning. And learning not just from books or school but from life.I don't want to make it seem like I hated the book because I certainly didn't. I learned a lot. But if I compare it to the other book I read by Robert Green, Mastery, in my opinion the former was much better!

ALL of his books aren't about learning to politic, or get along, or figure out how to win, the are more about learning to how play people, destroy your opponent and divert attention from your mistakes onto others's, there are some nuggets here and there, like law #35 when negotiating always give two options that you win either way.. never give one win and one loss option - I like that.. but then there are so many twisted ones in here.. honestly, he seems.. kind of cukoo.

  Even though I greatly enjoyed reading this book I felt that this book was nothing more than an expansion of ""The Prince"". From the style to the underlying concepts, it really felt like I was reading a modern day version of Machiavelli's classic. Other than that I felt that he over embellished on most of his so called ""laws"". Personally I felt that this book was way to long. He provided way to many thorough explanations where they weren't needed. If he trimmed out all of his over explanations and embellishments he probably could have summed up his 48 laws in less than 200 pages and would still have been able to get his arguments across.

  An uncanny and straightforward analysis of the ways of the world and how to navigate them to bring about the most fortuitous conclusion. As a sociology major in my school days, this book perfectly captures the essence of the sociological imagination described by C. Wright Mills: no individual has power except when we comprehend our position in society, where it is heading, and how we can join with others in shaping that trajectory. That said, many if not most of these laws can easily be used for manipulation and deceit, and some may be inherently inconsistent with honesty and fairness. For those who reject machiavellianism and seek to be loved rather than feared, this book will nonetheless help the reader identify where and how underhanded people work and can take measures to hinder their progress, if not stop them outright. The game of power is one we all must play, whether we choose to or not (much like ""the game""). What we do with power and how we share it determines the outcome.

    So Far so Good - Helps Understand the Techniques Used by the Controlling
  
",4.0,david,"Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  This book has caused quite a stir it seems. First, if you're worried it's a guide on how to be a sociopath, well, it's not. BUT, this book does go over various ways to come out on top in situations that involve a balance of power, and it is very blunt about how to do just that (to some extent). Most of these laws require practice to use effectively - noone's going to pick up this book and BOOM - next Machiavelli.Also important to note is that the laws themselves are neither moral nor immoral. They can be used to do good and bad things, to harm or to protect others, etc. On that same note, I wouldn't want an actual narcissist/sociopath to EVER get their hands on a book like this. I wouldn't brag about the knowledge in this book openly, and I'd only share its contents with close friends and family. Best to not have something like this in the hands of the abusive and the controlling.I really enjoy the format of the book. Each law tends to go like this:Judgement - synopsis of the lawTransgression - historical story of someone who failed to follow the lawObservance - historical story of someone who successfully followed the lawKeys to Power - Greene goes on to explain in more detail about the law and its usageReversal - exceptions to the lawBoth Transgressions and Observances have an interpretation of them in which Greene (author) gives his input about the stories. There are also little quotes/stories written in red on the side of the pages, which I personally didn't care for much. Everything in the book's format allows the reader to continually see the law in use, which makes it easier to remember, along with the use of stories to really aide memory retention.I personally have read and took detailed/concise notes on laws 1-13 so far, and plan on finishing them all chronologically, but you don't need to read the book in this manner.This book teaches many important lessons on how to deal with people in so many different ways. Even if you couldn't apply every law efficiently, just knowing the techniques of those who may want to harm you gives you quite an advantage. If anything, this book should be read by altruistic/loving/caring individuals, much more so than the selfish/abusive. They'd all benefit being much more aware of the potential ill will others bear. Of course, around decent, caring, and loving people, most of these laws are completely unnecessary.

  If you enjoy history, psychology, sociology and the dynamics of relationships you'll love this book.  Greene's work has the focus of Machiavelli's, The Prince, but is written in a voice similar to Dale Carnegie's, How to Win Friends and Influence People.  There's lots of practical advice with loads of examples to help everyone from the aspiring tyrant to the school teacher to the middle manager to the parent.  If you can get past the promotion of power (which I suspect is satirical like Machiavelli) there's much really good advice here to keep from being taken advantage of by people in power over you or those below you trying to pull themselves up at your expense.  So, read it, but don't take the admonition to power too seriously.

  This was a book that I’ve heard things about for years, a lot of them positive and then a lot of the negative depending on the person typically. Some said that it was about mind control and using people but just from some of the chapters I’ve read I don’t really see that I can see where they feel that way about certain laws but others are very real and it’s just hard reality to swallow for some people. Law 10 was one that really resonated with me in the situation I was currently going through at the moment with a person who is miserable and literally it was Word for Word what the person did and acted like. And the repercussions that I was suffering from a completely true so I highly recommend the book despite the controversy obviously take what you read with a grain of salt some of the things are Pretty dark but that doesn’t mean you have to follow it that way or you can interpret it differently.

  This was an amazing book for both business and strategy. It gave many historical examples for which each law applied and did it in such a way the law was also relevant to  modern times. This is an excellent book for anyone who is trying to get a grasp on the business world.Rich Poe did the narration for this on audible and he was excellent. His voiced possessed a serious tone that excentuated  the material being read and eleveated it to sound urgent and important. He did an excellent job!

  Whether you are a narcissist or sociopath looking to perfect your game, or just a decent human being trying to survive in a world of narcissists and sociopaths, everyone can benefit from studying the 48 laws.Some of the advice is controversial, and often even contradictory. For example, you are encouraged to protect your reputation at all costs, because once it's gone, there is no getting it back. But, in the very next chapter, the reader is told that there is no such thing as bad publicity, and it is sometimes good to invite scandal. I took off a star because I the book needs to be updated to address issues like social media and cancel culture.The author points out that we are all playing this game. People can piously claim that they are opting out, but in fact they are just losing. As distasteful as that is, I can't disagree with him.

  I can honestly say this book changed my outlook on life. I think this is a good read for anyone and at any point in their lives. Greene outlines his 48 rules and backs them with interesting historical anecdotes. Sometimes, when I feel like something is not going as well in my life as t should, I refer back to this book to see which rule can be improved upon. The book is designed for just that, review and improvement. Cannot stress enough how important this book is to me.

  A must read for all Divine Feminine Goddesses and Empaths. I recommend that you have access to a ""website"" while reading so you can find out about the ""rest"" of the story. For instance, the Bible tells of Cryus the Great who helped the children of Israel rebuild the temple (I think this story in the bible is a metaphor) but did you know a Woman Queen Warrior defeated Cyrus of the Babylonian empire, which the book The Secret speaks.  Her name Tomyris and she was of Iranian descent. Divine Feminine's and those of us who don't understand how the Game of Life is played need to get this book. I especially recommend this book for young woman whether you plan to be a work at home mother or business entrepreneur, either way it will help you avoid the pitfalls in life or help you when you fall into the pit with your eyes wide open how to recover and get out. Great read. Thank you, FREQUENCYPHOENIX555 for recommending this book. 😇🙏💖

  As a victim of manipulation,  I would like to warn people this book needs trigger alerting. Also this book holds a very rigid and unipolar approach to what power is. Power can hold different meanings to different people. Here it is all about getting what YOU WANT while creating wreckage and muck that you leave others to cleanup for you. A narcissistic approach, although I did see they tried to tell people that you should not use these techniques in your own nest and with your own people.

You should pee when you're in front of the toilet and you really need to. You should not pee when shaking hands with Obama.I get it.So how about devoting significant portions of the book to these contextual situations where one rule might violate another?Also, it seems to spend a thousand words covering a topic that only needs about 200.Overall, the book leaves me wondering why I purchased it.

  Decided I needed to read more, and I’ve always had an interest in social sciences and the like, this is one of the books I decided to purchase in order to satisfy both. The book came about 4 days after ordering, which was much quicker than expected, especially since it was over the weekend. The book was used, and upon flipping through the pages is very clear, a few folds or imprints in a few pages, but the condition is still exquisite. It came wrapped in a plastic wrap that was ripped, but did not affect its quality. Overall, delivery was great, as well as the packaging. As for the book itself, you probably know what you’re getting into just from the title. I just got it today so I have not read it, but if you are looking for an instructional book or a sort of social philosophy on power (mine being the latter), than this book will do fine, if not amazingly. However, just know that if you plan on following all of these “laws” that you may not be the best person. Power is a strange social construct and should only be sought or used if it is for good, otherwise you’re probably not a good person. Hope this helped, and I may update after reading the book. :)

  Robert Greene enfoca y usa como ejemplo a estafadores o personas viles, sin embargo, cada una de las leyes del poder si tienen una aplicación útil. Me explico, para Robert lo importante es obtener poder, sin embargo, es un poder insostenible considerando los engaños, la hipocresía, entre otros. Cuando sumas todas las recomendaciones te das cuenta que el verdadero poder está en transformar nuestro carácter para desarrollar comportamientos reales y no fingidos. En ese sentido, si se puede desarrollar poder con cada una de las leyes de tal forma que sea sostenible y duradero. Aunque la aplicación más evidente es a nivel empresarial, considero que es útil para todas nuestras áreas de vida.

  What we're reading in this book is exactly what we're seeing before our very eyes regarding politicians, the music and entertainment business,  religion, families (especially when there is  Will involved), corporate, the #MetooMovement, reality TV, and at our very own places where we work.I have no intention of following these types of behaviors which are advocated in this book.  According to the author, this probably means, i'll die, homeless, without friends, no makeup, broke,  bald, and disenchanted - Just like Nicola Tesla!When someone tells you to use ""Honesty as a tool for deception"" - then why even bother to use the word ""Honesty""?  Just say, ""Be a compulsive lying, manipulative, cold-blooded narcissist like our very own #45 (Trump and his administration), and you'll be wealthy.""Granted, the only people whom you'll call ""friends"" will basically be parasites, saboteurs, or con-artists, just like yourself!  This makes for  entertaining, intimate evenings with people you SHOULD enjoy being around.  You won't be happy, you have no one you can trust, no one can trust you, and any one who comes near you will probably have a concealed container of pepper spray, or weapon handy - just in case.This is a world, i can't stomach on most days, folks.  But it's real and surrounds us every single moment of our lives.  Millions of people are fighting for the chance being a ""courtier"".  Many of them just for the chance to eat the crumbs from their tables and brag about it.  People want to be seen, heard, revered, feared, and still come off as a ""class act"", or even worse? They demand respect, even when they have none for themselves.  But acording to the author? In order to ""look"" as if you have class, you have to act like something someone dragged from the depths of a compost pile to make it all happen.The author, has a point, and certainly does not hold back on the examples.  He did a great job with his research, and bringing his points home to the reader.  I'm just grateful, that i grew to have instincts later in life to just stay away from these types of people.The last thing i want to do when i go out to dinner with someone whom i call a friend, is have to deal with an individual who's been ""scripted"" by the writer of the Hunger Games.  I would like to HAVE dinner, not BE the dinner.I, for one, like to sleep at night.  But if i had to lay with the author or people of that type of mentality, i'd have to sleep with both eyes open..Great book, if you want to learn the ""mentality"" of the power hungry, status seeking, ambitious, manipulative, parasitic types.  If you don't want to read the book?  Keep watching the news.  Especially the politicians.  It's just as informative, as well as entertaining.  But even worse, today's news is  going to be someone's example for the next ""Power"" book.

  This is an excellent study of how power is used. I really liked the format. You can either read it cover to cover or pick out the laws that apply to your situation. There are many laws that I would never engage in myself but it's good to know them so that you can see when they're being used against you. It will surprise you how often that happens in social transactions that you normally wouldn't give much thought to.The other thing I liked about this book is how the author used snippets from the literary world in the margins of the book that pertained to the law being explored. This was a novel approach to make the points he was trying to make.

  Growing up we are taught to get good grades, work hard, etc, and you will move up. That's the lie. It's really these 48 laws that matter IF you want to advance in an organization. ALL organizations are political even if you don't see it or want to see it.This is a book about getting ahead in a political world. This is a book about advancing in corporate or government politics. I don't really care for these types of books or ""playing the game,"" but if you want to advance in the game, this is the road-map. After working 15 years in a government bureaucracy, I can vouch that these 48 laws are 100% true. It took me many years to realize these were the only rules that matter matter in organizations and it is disappointing news for idealistic people. The book is fantastic information even if you choose not to participate in the game.My only criticism is some of the dated stories used to support the laws can get boring at times.

  Good book to dip in and out of. You can skip around as much as you want. If you like reading about famous figures in history you will like this book because the entire book is examples of how great leaders or persons with other extraordinary people skills applied the themes described. Conveys an appreciation of why such people rose to such heights.

A good balance and guide for path to leadership. For those who are already not good people I see this book making them worse.

  While many of the rules are helpful, so many others are clearly problematic: use selective honesty to disarm your victim and pull one over on them; never do the work yourself, but always take credit, etc. etc.  If you want to end up powerful at the expense of humanity, then this is the book for you. :)

    The inside game
  
",5.0,RenegadeZennist,"Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  This book will change your life. The way you use it is up to you. The techniques, tactics and strategies in the book are not immoral, they are amoral. The tactics are neither good nor evil, but the nature of power means they will increase your capacity for either.More importantly, it will allow you to recognize these tactics when people use or prepare to use them against you. You'll be able to see their next move, predict how they will react when you counter their check. Being a victim in the game of life will be a lot less likely for you after reading this book.Beyond that, you will understand politics in an entirely new way. You'll start to see the moves the powerful make with a sharper perspective because you'll have the inside game.

    A Fantastic Gift for Children and Grandchildren ...
  
",5.0,Douglas A. Coggeshall,"Reviewed in the United States May 30, 2014","









  
  
    
  2014-05-30 ... I discovered the ""48 Laws of Power"" (48LP) about 15 years ago when it was first published.  A little background on why I was ""blown-away"" by this book.  First, I'm a history guy (who enjoys a well-written account).  Second, I'm a professional (Senior Mechanical Engineer) working in an office environment.  Third, during the first two decades of that career I witnessed (as do we all) the typical variations of Machevellian blood-letting in the office, as the ""Bad Guys"" decimated their way to the top of the corporate ladder.  Indeed, I was at least once or twice the unwitting ""pawn"" in their plans, and my ignorance of their genuinely ""evil ways"" caused me and my family financial harm.  So I accidently discover (and purchase) 48LP, just on a whim.  I was astounded !!!  I read about 4 chapters a night, often (almost) literally falling-out of my reading chair.  For every ""law"" that Robert Greene expounded on, I recalled event after event where I had seen it happen in my own career.  Great ""office politics"" mysteries were finally understood.  I immediately purchased four (4) hard-back versions for my children (then in their teens); the books were safely put-away, and then (10 years later) given to each of my kids as they entered the professional workforce in their twenties.  They've actually appreciated the knowledge and wisdom Robert Greene writes about.  Do your children and grandchildren a big favor -- protect them (armed with exceptional knowledge) from the Machevellian ""office criminals"" that they'll encounter in their own furures.

Or perhaps I had and hearing someone else say it validated as the book uses historical facts to defend each law of power. If you are a righty like me, and would like to become more intouch with your right I recommend it. Too much if any one type of thinking can provoke us to be radical, always healthy to keep an open mind and consider the opposition. Also, don’t read ahead! ;-)

    When trash and scumbags rule the world, only more trash and scumbags will be born
  
",4.0,BlackWeasel,"Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2016","









  
  
    
  This is a great book if you want to have the Armor of Knowledge equipped in your head. Certain laws contradict each other but the whole point is to use them when the need arises. There's 48 laws while during my lifetime, I will have countless encounters with people I prefer to avoid. Not just the workplace but school and real life I see not just stupid people but deceiving, narcissistic, and self-absorbed who want to shove your views down your throat. You can get respond back and crush their spirit (Law 15) or leave them alone for the insects that they are (Law 36). This book may be looked as manipulative but the people who have used these laws have their names carved onto History. And as a result, the Author has broken down their actions of the past and turned them into a guide on how to help and instruct the reader on how to master himself or herself and take on the world.  But then again this is how certain trash and scumbags are born. Genghis Khan, Count Victor Lustig, Yellow Kid Weil, King Henry (don't know which one), Mao Zedong (He lowkey uses this Man a lot). I'm giving this 4 stars outta 5 because there's some laws I wouldn't use. Maybe because I'm a nice guy but I prefer not to have ghosts from the past haunting my behind. The IRS can do that.

  If you could mix The Art of War and The Prince, with some War and Peace mixed in, you'd end up with something like The 48 Laws of Power.I listened to this book on Audible originally but so enjoyed it that I bought a paperback copy as a gift for my cousin, then for my best friend, another Audible edition for another friend (who's listening to it for his second time now) then finally finding a hardcover for myself.The author names each law, gives an overview, and then gives examples throughout history of how these laws were applied correctly (and incorrectly). It's incredibly well-presented, and engaging all the way through. I thoroughly enjoyed it.If someone were to follow every one of these laws to a T, they'd probably be adopted by the Kims or something, but I don't think that is the intention here. Ultimately that comes down to you, the reader.With this book, you can see exactly they methods that others may use to keep you down, or hinder your opportunities while advancing their own interests. Many laws can safely be applied without putting others down to better yourself. Once again, that's up to you.Great book no matter how you cut it.

  The reviews on whether this book is moral or not aren't relevant: Greene makes excellent use of historical examples in proving each law, and history is based on facts rather than morals. Each law has been historically demonstrated, and a plethora of laws are plainly visible in the world today. A fantastic read on the different manifestations of power, how those have come to pass in history, and how you can usurp them (to a degree) for your own purposes. It spurred me to buy three other Greene books. Highly recommend, at the very least so you can become aware of how power manifests itself.

  I wish I had found this book years ago as a parent, but somehow my 17 year old son came across it and read it and enjoyed it. Authors use of stories about historical figures to describe concepts helps to keep readers interest. It sparked many a conservation between me and my son. I liked it because it helped my son to understand many of the things I I have tried to teach him as he was growing up. It has helped look at and deal with people in a more sophisticated and mature way. In fact, he has has tells me he has been more successful using concepts when playing video games that involve complex social interactions. I am given serious thought on buying more copies to give to my  two other sons as a book they can keep their entire lives.

  This book is Phenomenal. You might not become a powerful figure by reading this, but it will definitely give you a better handle on how politics, and people really work and think. Each law has an example taken from history, sometimes when the law was followed, when it was transgressed, and sometimes both. These stories are often hilarious, clever, and sometimes you really just have to put the book down and reflect of how amazing some events in history truly were. Each chapter is short, great to read in one go, also a great bathroom reader as well. Would definitely recommend to anyone who's interested in what really drives people as to better understand how to better accomplish one's own goals.

    A Captivating, Eye-opening, and Unapologetic Foray Into The Realm of Power
  
",5.0,Mike Morgenstein,"Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2017","









  
  
    
  The 48 Laws of Power is a captivating, eye-opening, and unapologetic foray into the realm of power, and how to harness it for yourself. The chapters are beautifully structured with first the law of power in question, then a terse description of it, then in bulk you get an interpretation of the law that strings together many historical examples, and this is concluded by a reversal which goes over what situations the law may not be applicable in. This book is not an inquiry on the morality concerning the attainment of power. These laws were and will continue to be adhered by both the good and the bad. Law 26 is ""Keep your hands clean""; this is how mafia bosses have often had the ability to orchestrate the most foul crimes with impunity. They are able to layer their command chain down so many levels that it makes it very difficult to trace the main perpetrator, the one commanding the crimes rather than those carrying it out. Law number 43 states that you should ""work on the hearts and minds of others"". Something like this was done by both Obama and Mao. Both for different purposes with different outcomes. The point is that by operating within the framework of the law helped both men achieve the higher level status that they obtained that enabled them to make a difference.

  The 48 Laws of Power breaks down HOW the Power Game works in Society by 48 principles then it goes into real historical examples of people who used those principles to success and power and examples of people who disregarded those principles and the failure that followed. It is an amoral NOT immoral look at Power Games throughout history and as Machiavelli's ""Prince"" a look into that world. It's action packed and hard to put down. It's practical and gut level. It's where reading that book that You look into Your own life and begin to compare and see Your own successes and failures comparing them to those principle that it hits hard. If nothing else it give a look into the shadowy world of the Global Elites and HOW they ALL operate in their own games in High Society and being aware gives You a safeguard in life to know the users and power game freaks out there.

  Condensing the attainment of power into 48 laws is a tough undertaking.

",5.0,R. Stark,"Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2010","









  
  
    
  I read an average of 3 to 4 books per month...every month...and of the thousands that I have read..this condensed blend of psychology, history, and order is a significant solution for depression! In the words of Yoda ""Named must your fear be...before banish it you can!"" This book helps you to define the game of power;to know when and how you will be,or are currently being manipulated, in the struggle for power. Many say that depression is a lack of empowerment...you might find it here. Some of the chapters are distubing...unsettling even, as the meaning remains like a pebble in your shoe, to motivate reflection and change. Well done. I received a new Kindle recently...this was the first book I purchased for it...and undoubtedly the best. I know that it's available on CD now...I'd like to see Amazon offer a combo price for download (Audio and Kindle book).

    Modern Version of Machiavelli
  
",4.0,Eric S Metcalf,"Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2014","









  
  
    
  The best way to read this book is as a modern version of Machiavelli's The Prince.  Machiavelli was not advocating the ethos or ethics of what he was recommending; he was describing a brutally pragmatic and realistic approach to gaining and retaining political power.  Greene writes in much the sane way; this is not a book about ethics, it is a book about gaining and retaining power, regardless of position.  It also serves as a useful guide to things that people will do to you to gain power over you; it is important to understand these techniques to defend against them, even if you don't use them to gain power over others.

    Understand the concepts dont try to implement you will destroy yourself
  
",5.0,Nathik,"Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2013","









  
  
    
  This is no doubt one of the best books I've read along with Greene's Art of Seduction, but truth be told it ends there its just a good read, more than the content, if you look at the perspective that Greene employs, its actually very grim, it makes it seem like every one out there is using each other, you also have to use the people around you to survive. Now that is really destructive, like covey says ""our perceptive governs the way we see, and how we see governs the way we behave"", I read this book several years back and I can guarantee you, if you try to employ these means you wont be able to trust anybody and nobody will trust you either, if fact you'll become extremely suspicious of everyone's motives, things get complicated.How I would suggest you read this book is, read it for fun, these laws and their stories are very admirable but also understand them and ask a lot of questions as in ""why does this work?"", ""could I have used this in the past"", and once you're done with it, forget the law, just dont even think of it. Your mind is so beautiful, if you truly and deeply understand something, at the right time in your life, your mind will furnish you with it. So just understand it the content, enjoy his perspective and don't get sucked into it.And remember always in life, what you give is what you get.

  I chose to buy this book off Amazon due to the fact that it was no longer sold at my current school's bookstore. For anyone who wants to up their social standing, is studying psychology and/or sociology, or anyone who wants to harness their inner power more, THIS IS THE BOOK. I enjoy how it gives historical references that are relevant even to the times we are in in addition to giving explanations on the side such as info behind historical figures and the like. While some of the laws may seem too harsh (such as crushing your enemies totally) or frankly impossible, for some people, I still recommend reading about it to have a better understanding of it. All in all, an excellent read.

    A Good Man is Rarely Great and A Great Man Is Rarely Good
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2013","









  
  
    
  I've read through the negative reviews for this book, men and women who hold high credentials, many liberals who compare these practices to the defunct companies and CEOs of the time.  They call it amoral, or outright manipulative.  News Flash for you, we are all manipulators, every decisions and choice we make in interpersonal relationships, is an act of manipulation.  The problem is that people rarely want to accept this dark truth and instead want to hold up the vale of selflessness believing that a life of sacrificing one's own happiness for the happiness of others is a true path to success in life.I am a liberal.  I voted Obama twice, I vote Democrat 90% of the time.  But, to say that politicians don't use these techniques to great effect to gain power would be ridiculous.  To say that Obama didn't use these effects... you must be kidding me.  His entire story in politics is one of Machiavellian rise.  Then, the negative reviewers mock politics, and say, ""Well if you want to be a politician, than go for it.""  This book doesn't promote stealing or defrauding people.  This book is about using and manipulating circumstances and events to have people elevate you to places of power by raising your status and importance.  This is not what Enron did that made it a bad company.  This is not what Dick Cheney did that made him a bad man.  This is not what Jack Abramaof did that got him put in jail.  It was the crimes, the theft, the defrauding, and the occasional murder. It is what got Dick Cheney put in power and what has happened to him.  Is he awaiting trial?  No he isn't.  Is he being put to death?  No, no... he's not.  Is he living high off of our money, able to travel the world with all the protection any man could ask for... yes, yes that does seem to be what he's doing.  Interesting... very interesting. Nowhere does this book recommend criminal behavior.  Nowhere does this book promote crime.  It promotes deception, it promotes using the true nature of human psychology that almost every leader has ever used.Whitewashed text books that talk about win-win scenarios are idealistic at best, plain wrong at most.  I'm someone who has read every one of them.  Social Psychology text books, Persuasion and Influence Textbooks, and have read the studies and methods.  Here's what we now know, an expensive piece of jewelry looked at from about a distance of ten or more feet away, while standing on a soft carpet is more desirable, than when standing three or five feet away on a soft carpet, however, even more desirable, when standing on a hard floor three to five feet away, but less desirable on a hard floor ten or more feet away.  This is why you'll see several stores using carpet in one area, and floor in the jewelry area.  It's not manipulation, it's using human psychology to your advantage.This is simply a book distilling what has worked throughout history.  Call me bitter.  I've had businesses undermined by people who have used these strategies, I've had girlfriends stolen by people who swept in with neurosis and need and creating false wants, it's only when I decided that everyone else is living a life the way they want it, and on their own terms, and I'm playing by mystical rules that few others are following that my life began to change.  When I threw away the morals and ethics and decided instead to embrace my life as my own and to live it with my full ability.Not only is this book a handy guide to getting and staying in power, it's a handy guide to watching people who are trying to take that power from you.

",4.0,Patricia Hester,"Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2011","









  
  
    
  I bought this book because I am the only female working in an environment of men -- most commonly thirty-five to sixty men and most of them under the age of forty.  The environment can be empathic or hostile and can change its face at any given moment. Having deciphered those moments of change as moments of power grabs or diversions, I decided that I needed to understand how and why power is obtained.The 48 Laws of Power did help me understand how power can be obtained and did give me some defensive mechanisms to thwart unnecessary anxiety when struggles occur.  The divisive thought that arose for me while reading the book was the manipulative role of women in power. Can we really lose power by not showing enough love?  Can we be as aggressive as men in seeking power without making us more vulnerable?  Must we do without friends in such an environment?I agreed with the concepts of concealment, saying less than necessary, guarding reputations,not offending the wrong person, assuming formlessness, etc. However, in my work environment it is impossible to avoid the unlucky, use bait to get people to come to me, use generosity to disarm my victims, use absence to increase respect and honor,not build fortresses to protect myself, not offend the wrong person, play the perfect courtier,keep my hands clean, create a cultlike following, plan all the way to the end, or create compelling spectacles.I don't believe I could use many of the laws in daily practice, but the book did help me understand those who do and did increase my understanding of power brokers in a difficult environment.

Not only does he demonstrate the law being utilized successfully, he also gives (often humorous and ironic) stories detailing unfortunate results due to the law NOT being observed. I'm not a history buff, but I really enjoyed the stories.Also, in the margins of the book, the author lists relevant quotes from famous people, as well as fables, folktales, and other tidbits of information that demonstrate that chapter's law.Overall it's a smart, entertaining and clever read.

  This book was given to me by my brother. He said it would change my life and it did.  It is very split up into small parts that make it either very easy or very difficult to read according to your nature. Each law has examples for and against it from historic figures. After reading this book i identified so many behaviors in myself and others. It allowed my to take better control of myself and my relationships.That being said this book requires work.  Self improvement is never easy. The way it's divided makes it a long term project. Revisiting it after digesting its insights will surely give perspective to you and the people in your life.

  This is a great book. The laws really give you an insight to various power struggles, successes and techniques. I found this book both informative and instructional when it came to various situations which we all take part in in our daily lives.One thing which particular stood out for me with this book was how Robert Greene gave case studies of the past where it was used. During Chinese Dynasties or War Situations. These really helped to see how the law works and where you can apply the law to help all those around, even if it is just yourself.

  You have lots of ideas about what POWER IS. Most of your ideas are probably wrong. It's not your fault. The news shows clearly 99% of people AREN'T powerful. Why? One big reason: a lack of readily available knowledge on the subject. Type POWER into Amazon search and you'll find a only handful of books on the subject, most of them mediocre. Same goes for the Internet. Don't you find that odd?People are only as good at something as they have learned and applied in their life. This holds true for everything, including power.The 48 Laws Of Power is one of the best books on the topic: Well thought out, well written, and well packaged. The formula is the same for Robert Greene's other books, as well.It's a big book with lots to digest and worth it. Best read one chapter per sitting. Then take some time away to reflect. That kind of a good book.I've read A LOT of books on the subject of Power. To save you time and money, here's a variety of other goods books on power: Power vs Force by David Hawkins, The Prince by Machiavelli, Art Of War by Sun Tze, On War by Carl von Clausewitz, Knowledge/Power by Foucault, Art Of Power by Thich Nhat Hanh, Anatomy Of Power by John Kenneth Galbraith, Secrets Of Power vol 1 & 2 by Ingo Swann, and Power by Jeffrey Pfeffer. These titles run the gamut from Spirituality to War to Government and Office Politics to Philosophy and more.What's missing from all these books? This: Power is different at every level of human development. What's needed is the additional  understanding that transformation plays in power. I coach clients daily in mastering their own power. When they learn about power they use what they have better and more wisely. They acquire more power while staying a ""good guy"". Most everyone both craves and fears power. As a result, they lack true power. They crave power because deep inside they feel powerless and a need to control others OR they fear power from a concern of abusing it. All this is learned in childhood and needs to be re-learned in an intelligent and healthy way in adulthood because power is at the core of everyone of us. It drives everything we do and we all need more of YOU.48 Laws Of Power is a solid read to help you understand both the strengths and possible consequences of many different kinds of power and power plays. Combine it with the previous titles and you'll possess a quality section in your library on Power. Hope this helps. Enjoy!

  The information in The 48 Laws of Power is excellent and could be used for the purposes of good or bad, depending on how the reader applies it. Also, there were a lot of interesting history lessons, various power plays from the past that we can learn from, that helped put the laws into context.  I liked reading about situations in which people broke a law (and the result). My only complaint is that the electronic version had some annoying misspellings and missing images.

    Good advice, great stories
  
",5.0,Aaron G.,"Reviewed in the United States December 17, 2009","









  
  
    
  Many of the reviews on here (okay, several, I only skimmed those on the front page) are critiquing the book solely as a self-help or business strategy book. That's fine; that's what the book is usually billed as.Yes, the laws provide important lessons on life. The reader may integrate them into their worldview as they and their moral sense sees fit.However, the laws themselves are just a small part of why I find this book so enjoyable, and why I feel compelled to take it off the bookshelf every so often. If you only want a run-down of Greene's laws, you don't have to look far for those (hint: if you don't mind squinting, it's called the ""Look Inside"" feature). But you'll be missing so much.Greene accompanies each of his laws with examples taken from history, myth and literature, demonstrating the advice followed as well as ignored, and the supposed ramifications of each path. Along the way, little anecdotes and excerpts along the same theme are included in the margins (this may be Joost Elffers' contribution).Whether or not you agree with Greene's conclusions (he is an English major and a writer, after all, not a world leader), reading how he interprets these stories and ties them to the main advice is highly enjoyable. You will be exposed to a lot of literary and historical references that you may not have been until now, and may pick up a number of ideas for further study.If you just want a list of platitudes and are not interested in the rest of the writing, then I would suggest you go right to the source with 

  
The Art of Worldly Wisdom









  
  
    
  . You will find that almost all of Greene's laws come from Gracian's 300 aphorisms in one way or another. Unlike Gracian's concise little manual, however, Greene offers a brief literary and historical study with each case that's certainly worth the price of admission. In fact, I recommend you buy both of the books.

  This book is really well written. The examples and stories in it are excellent and entertaining in themselves. Your life is probably not as grand as the situations that are explained in the book, and of past lives in history. Its hard to change the way you live and come into situations where you can use this knowledge. I understand, and have a WAY different view of how the world works now, that I can use from time to time as a guide.**2013 updated** If you use this book as a life guide you will be missing the finer points that matter most. Trust, friendship, and love are more important than anything in this book. You could very well master everything in here be dysfunctional inside. You can't always have the upper hand and amaze people. Control does not fulfill or make life worth living. I'm not religious but the bible contains better wisdom than this book. Its still worth reading though.

  Wish I would of gotten the concise version. By the time I got half way through the book, I just wanted the key point of the Law, without having to read pages of ancient European or Asian history demonstrating the law in effect (or not) as a prequel. Although, some of the stories where interesting, some were total snoozers and made you feel like you were back in grade school, being forced to read your boring history assignment for the night (history wasn't my favorite subject lol). Overall a good book, and I would recommend to anyone. I see how it can be used for evil, but it's more important to know when the Laws are being used on YOU.

  I have just spent all summer reading and digesting this book and am  eagerly awaiting Greene's October release of ""The Art of  Seduction.""Nietzsche once wrote, ""Anything truly productive  is offensive.""  Offensive was my first reaction to ""The 48 Laws  of Power.""  But after careful reading I am convinced this is the best  book on practical psychology I have ever read.  Pay no attention to the  reviewers who say the laws contradict each other.  They don't.  They rather  compliment each other in the game of life.  Read in a spirit of adventure  (and with some humor as well) and you will find this book richly rewarding.  I wish I had had this guide years ago.

  Robert Greene is well respected, and his books are all held in high regards- and rightly so. Instead of rehashing what everyone else has said, I'll briefly explain why this book should be a cornerstone on which to base your life.-This book will introduce you to the greatest Kings, Queens, Generals, Monks, Conmen, Magicians, Strategists, Seducers, scientists...the best the world has ever known. Should you find something to dig deeper into, you will already have a name to start your research with.- This book is not written as an academic exercise. There is nothing theoretical about this book. What you read can be directly applied in life.- These laws are timeless. Contrary to popular belief, the generations that come after us are no smarter than those who precede us.Technology, rules, governments, and societies as a whole may change, but people will remain inherently the same. To master this book is to be able to navigate through the masses and get to where you want to go in life.- You will learn to have direction. If you have dreams and goals, this book will help you figure out the basics of reaching out for help, for contacting others, knowing who to trust, etc.  Law 13 alone can change the course of a man's career- ""When Asking for Help Appeal to People's Self-Interest, Never To Their Mercy or Gratitude.""Study the book. Memorize the Laws. Highlight, take notes, and read seriously-You owe it to yourself. If you want to be the best, make it to the top of whatever field you're in- you will need this book.

  This book, while somewhat repetitive towards the end of the book, is organized well, written superbly, and is a wonderful overview of the meaning and application of power throughout. Many vignettes of both fables, stories (whether fictional, rumored, or historical) put the reader in the shoes of those in a position of power (or lack thereof), and how to use power to affect outcomes. Marvelous book.

  POWER... It's ruthless, it's cunning, it's loyal, it's backstabbing.  Just like life really is without the sugar or even Equal.  This extension of Niccolo Machiavelli's ""The Prince"" is so interesting to read.  I couldn't put the book down and finished it on the plane to Italy and back.  If you can take some harsh realities and realize that people are just like you and are mainly interested in their own survival and not necessarily yours... you'll be able to accept what this book has to offer.  If you're timid... read the Prince first.  Then graduate to POWER.

    Machiavellian, deceptive and decadent...
  
",5.0,Victor Lopez,"Reviewed in the United States June 11, 2013","









  
  
    
  Although many other would see the contents of this books to be either cynical, deceptive, cowardly or even evil, I'd say it's a most valuable asset in our society to learn how to play the game of power.We all seek power in different ways: some seek it in love, others in money; others are simply intoxicated by the game, how it's played and how to bend the rules to their will. Those who have obtained true power didn't obtained it by mercy and compassion or empathy, but by trickery, deception, might and sheer willpower. Even the prophets like Moses, Muhammad and Jesus understood this well.Nevertheless I'd recommend this book to anyone interested in how the wolves of this world think and how to avoid such individuals, but in my case, the dark side of things all so sweeter...

",5.0,Busy Reader: Get To The Point,"Reviewed in the United States April 17, 2008","









  
  
    
  This book is a must-read for anyone who wants to live an independent life. You will encounter the challenges Greene writes about, and this book offers useful strategies for overcoming them.I know Greene's thinking is sound because I've tested it. With no business or technical education, I managed to increase my income 400% in just a few years. With my own money and leverage, I bought a house in the most expensive city [housing-wise] in America.Maybe your ambitions are different. Whatever you want, you won't get it without planning. All along the way, you must deal with people. You must get around or through them. This book is a great help. It is a masterpiece. I can't recommend it too strongly. I've read it through twice, listened to it on CDs and dipped deeply into Greene's bibliography. Read this book, you will never regret it.

  I refer to this book often when I have a work problem.  I have learned how to exercise restraint in what I say at work, how to delegate, and how to appear more powerful and confident than I really am.  Some of the advice you have to take with a grain of salt if you are not a ""master manipulator""; however, it sheds some great light on the power struggles of history and how to apply them to modern day.  I don't share this book with many people, as I like to keep my strategies close to my chest, but it really helps to anticipate others' power plays and avoid pitfalls of being the ""victim"".

  I remember a friend at work recommended reading this book. He was going to let me borrow it(I bought the Art of Seduction and planned on reading it before reading this) and I would let him borrow the Art of Seduction; a book exchange. Unfortunately, my friend was fired so I didn't get the chance to borrow the 48 Laws.I had remembered  this, and went ahead and bought it. I thought it was better to read this first before the Art of Seduction. Before reading the 48 Laws, I began the Art of Seduction, but couldn't get into it.As soon as I began 48 Laws, I was intrigued. This was kind of book I was looking for. Because of my interest in the 48 Laws, I began the Art of Seduction again; reading these two books, side by side(not literally), I saw connections, and wanted to finish them; because of my curiosity, I wanted to see if these principles can be applied.I like the author's style of writing, explaining historical events, describing classical literary works; he would then explain observances and transgressions of these Laws, and how they can be interpreted.I really liked this book, and will come back to it again for another read.

Wish I had read it before I made all the career blunders and politically stupid things thanks to the way my parents brougt me up - to be open, honest, nice and GOOD.

  This book is written very well and gives you a history lesson as well as depicting each use of all 48 laws of power. Some lessons can be used day to day, while some may take some time to apply effectively. It gives you the transgression of each law and the reversal which is greatly helpful, so you don't get caught in anothers trap or so you can avoid a backfire of your plan. This book revolves around the concept of deceit. So if your not comfortable with lying and deceiving, than this book is not for you.

  This is by far one of my favorite books! Some may say it is a very cynical read, but given its applications for real life situations it would seem ""cynical"" is the appropriate response; life is cruel after all. But beyond the author's style of writing, I appreciate the many ""bonuses"" from reading these collections: The historical observations of each law, the pros and cons when applying them, and the little side notes/stories/quotes at each turn of a page. I recommend everyone give it a read.

The spine had some rip and tears. Not upset about it really, but don't to sell me something new, when it was a used product.

  It has been several months since I became a disciple of Mr. Greene.  I don't read this book, I study it.I have stood up to abusive relatives by retreating when I had to, waiting for them come to me, saying less than is necessary and ultimately winning through my actions not argument.The chapter on dealing with your boss is invaluable.  I am careful now to never seem like a smart-ass in front of my supervisors. They are the sun and I orbit them- no problem.I have used the chapters on playing to people's fantasies and building a cult in five easy steps to create an amazing program in my classroom that my students cannot resist- it helps them learn and the parents love it.I have just gotten started.  I love this book so much and am so grateful to have found it.If you are foolish enough to think power is a worthless commodity then answer me this:  Why do the wealthiest men in the world, men who have everything money can buy, run for political office?  They do it because power is an irresistible delicacy.I've had a taste and I'm coming back for more!

  The new "" How to win friends and influence people"" but this is geared more towards the modern age. A look into human nature and the struggle for power and control over money and people. Even if you don't agree with these methods they exist and at the very least you should be conscious and aware of them. Successful people know how to play the game and manipulate people to their advantage. I have known a lot of successful players and being nice and kind were not their star attributes. Intelligence and cunningness oozed from their persona. They knew what to do and say and how to make someone work for them.Some people live an entire life and never figure it out. This book is a ""heads up"" about how it all works. Some of the methods come across as uncouth but chances are no one will think twice about doing it to you if need be. You either play along or get squashed.The book is a LONG read and the examples from history became tedious to read but I stuck with it.I urge readers to look for video interviews with the author robert greene after you finish reading the book. It makes a fine edition to the reading.I am ordering Art Of Seduction next.I thought very highly of this book.Give it to a college student as a gift.Wise Wise Words....

This book is not for the betterment of humanity, but a book for the ego mind.5 stars because the book serves as an eye opener to a many loop holes to ""power"". We do not want power. We just need to understand it.Read every law. The book should only take you minutes to read or less than a day. You only need to know it's laws not become it. Our world need better members of society that are open minded and are not subjugated to corruption.

  From the second a friend of mine handed me his copy of this book, dog eared and highlighted throughout, I knew that I needed a copy. Since ordering it, I have done the exact same thing.Robert Greene outdoes himself in this work. His books are always pragmatic and geared towards realists. These laws that he describes are wonderful ways for dealing with even the smallest details of your life. Knowing when to speak up, knowing when to speak out, and knowing how to bring out the best qualities in yourself and others are integral parts of the business and social world today.Added to these tenets are stories of the laws in practice. What happens when you try to make your boss look bad? It happened to this person. Too shy to speak up - this is what happens. Need to re-invent yourself at work? Watch how this person did it.There is a situation for nearly every part of your life. And you will see in your own life places to apply these principles. And how to succeed with them.Disclaimer - if you’re a rosy optimist, this book is not for you. I handed to my wife, who amounted it to a book on manipulating people. It definitely isn’t, but it WILL show you how to maximize your potential.

  I like the anecdotes, although simplified, condensed, and likely taken out of context.  The author points out things which should be obvious but most of us need refreshers from time to time.  It can be somewhat depressing to see life portrayed in such cold, callous terms, but there is some truth to it.  I would not advise someone to live one's life by these ""laws"", but the author does point out that the ""laws"" do not apply to everyone.

But so far I would recommend this book to my friends and family. I am happy with this purchase! It's a guide you can use and look back on for years to come.

    Not relevant in today's world of abundance and choice
  
",2.0,Kermit Kordell,"Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2014","









  
  
    
  It took away my confidence, making me suspicious and playing games with everyone, and made me lose some of my authenticity, which is actually my strength. It is aimed at a time in which you don't have much choice: Either you get to the top or you lose everything you have, so winning in the organization you are at is really a matter of life is or death. Today, on the other hand, we live in a world of free choice and abundance. What you get and don't get depends on your skills that are valuable to others. The more valuable and rare your skills are, the more freedom and power you will have. Freedom, because many will need you. Power, because you can demand more, the more valuable you skills.Today, you don't need power games. Instead, focus your time and energy on building your value for others rather than playing power games. The value you can offer to others will be a much more worthwhile investment, because with a high degree of value, you can exercise so much power and freedom that power games become irrelevant. If you don't like what your organization is offering you, but you have a lot of value, you can find someone else who is willing to offer you more, and simply state your terms. If they don't meet them, leave.This is the power of skill in today's world of abundance and choice.Focusing your energies on building your skill will make you more confident, make you feel better about yourself, and will bring you much more freedom and power than conspiring and playing power games will from the same effort.48 Laws Of Power might be valuable in a time of scarcity and lack of choice - When your life depended on being able to carve out as much as possible from the slight  slice of bread that was offered. In today's world, however, if you have something to offer, you can simply decide to leave the old slice for the vultures, and instead go and trade your skills for a much bigger and tastier piece which you can have all for yourself.For a book about how to achieve real power and freedom in today’s world of abundance, instead look at Cal Newport’s book “So Good They Can’t Ignore You”.

",4.0,Nir@d,"Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2006","









  
  
    
  Robert Greene interprets past events deciphering the rise and fall of some of histories most prominent figures. His cursory narration molds the likes of Cesar Borgia right before your eyes from a cynical perspective; necessary in recognizing such blatant ascendancy otherwise missed in casual history books. Greene emphasizes the point very well in each chapter, though no particular order puts one law over another.This makes a great prequel to The 33 Strategies of War

    Not laws, more like organized observations.
  
",3.0,S. Bhatt,"Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2013","









  
  
    
  I'm from science engineering background. A word like law, to me, applies to things like conservation of momentum, gravity, etc. Things which are simply put and true everywhere. With that title ""48 Laws of Power"" the author and publisher are setting our expectation for something like that. Unfortunately, the ""laws"" in the book are neither that simple, nor really set in stone.Every ""law"" is organized in a very systematic way. Starting with brief statement. Followed by a set of ""transgressions"" and ""observations"" of that law. Those are usually anecdotes/famous incidents from history, which illustrate someone breaking the law(transgression) or following the law to great effect(observation). These stories are followed by ""Interpretation"" which is essentially the author's analysis and opinion of situation, things like what were the intentions of the actors, what they did to achieve it, why they did it that way and why it worked. Each chapter ends with ""reversal"". Reversal is just an obscure way to say ""Exceptions""As I'm reading these laws, (I'm already up to law 6) I am noticing that each law has exceptions, disguised as ""reversals"". This makes the title of this book very misleading. I wish there was a simple set of rules that we could follow to get power, unfortunately that's just not true.  It is very complex.I still like the writing of this book, it's interesting. I'd read it just for some food-for-thought, even though in the preface the author claims that reading this book for amusement would be irresponsible, which I don't understand at all.I have had this issue with many books, esp in the self-help category. A great example is 

  
Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus: The Classic Guide to Understanding the Opposite Sex









  
  
    
   where the author spends a lot of time in early chapters with fluff. One of the things he said was something to this effect ""when I conduct seminars many couple approach me and say that we completely identify with your categorization but the husband feels like he's from venus and the wife from mars. That's completely normal, it's called role reversal"". A glaring example of writing a whole book as if it's a law of nature and then sneaking in a ""oh and by the way, it's perfectly normal to have an exception"".Publishers need to advertise books like these as if they are laws of nature, to get a cult following. Unfortunately the truth is gray, complex. Complex material doesn't sell that well, so we are left with best sellers wh, skew our perspective and alter our reality to the point where we can no longer tackle the reality, the supposed purpose of the book.My advise is to read this very interesting book. But read it cynically. Evaluate it critically, don't submit your reality to it.

",5.0,JT,"Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2018","









  
  
    
  So entertaining,, full of history and detailed accounts.Complaint: I  try to follow a story,  then the author cuts it off and interjects a completely different story before completing the original one. It's the most annoying thing about this book. If he's doing it to increase interest,  or power,  it didn't work on me. I already enjoy this book,  no need for that trick.Praise: in a world of humans full of ego,  the author gives valuable insight into human behavior. Some of it really doesn't apply nowadays like (crush your enemy completely), really,  does anyone kill their own children like that Chinese Empress that did anything to destroy her competition to the throne. Still I'm fascinated by human behavior so even these crazier stories were interesting to me.I consider myself very protective of innocents from deceptive individuals.  What better way to become a strong protector than by understanding the dark side of humanity.Ps. Not everything suggested will work. For example ""If you want to seduce a woman,  court her sister first- Stehndal "". Someone i already liked tried this on me,  as soon as he mentioned my sister or any other women i banished him from my life. I know he's in pain rn and i love it.

    Closer to The Form of Power
  
",5.0,J. Patterson,"Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2008","









  
  
    
  Just what is power? I believe that through the amoral approach demonstrated in the 48 Laws of Power, Greene has gotten much closer to this answer and at the same time, gotten around many of the issues that plague discussions of power. This does not mean that ethics is not important when handling power, but rather, that power is morally neutral and is a tool that one can utilize within their own ethical systems. Everybody from the subjectivist to the altruistic individual can make use of power as it is defined in this text.While some may become disgusted at the ammorality and the examples that often show a ""low brow"" use of power, this does not take away from the value of this book, and in fact probably adds to it by showing how power can be used to harm others; someone could probably even apply Law 7 (which in part refers to using the wisdom of others) in order to create examples that show positive uses of power.Overall, I would recommend this book for anybody, but especially those studying Leadership and/or Politics.

    Great Read, OVER-RATED as a life changing book.
  
",3.0,Nicholas Sanchez,"Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2018","









  
  
    
  3.2 out of 5 ! Okay, let me be as real as I can.  The 48 laws of power is well researched, containing great applications of historical, poetic, & artisic examples.  The author seems to repeat & disect the same individuals to obtain ""laws of power"",  this comes off as a bit repetitive(for example, the sun king, napolean, the yellow kid, rothschild, etc).  The Laws are applicable to a degree.  The author potrays these laws as the reality of life, if you transgress the laws you will reap the consequences.  However, this is simply not the case.  A majority of these laws if applied will at the most give you a momentary gain, but in the long run will end up ruining your moral spine, and mold you into a lying con-man/actor, leading to your eventual loss not only of power, but even your social and physical life.(For example, Marco Bragadino is an example used as a observer of the Law of power, yet by applying the law in his life he gained an amount of power, only to be followed by losing his life, by swindling and conning, instead of just working for a living.)  Granted this book is an entertaining read, most certaintly a great collection of examples and sources to be meditated upon.  But, it should be noted this is not a view changing book as you see in most reviews.  This is more or less a great book to form you into a great-con man or fake individual(literally advising you to wear a mask around your personality, to avoid displaying your thoughts and intentions) not necessarily a powerful person.  It is a book I will keep in my library for the purpose as a conversation stater, or in obtaining sources.  Final thoughts.  This book is worth the read, but it is overrated in the reviews.  3.2 out of 5.

    Great Book, Terrible Kindle Edition
  
",2.0,Trenton Bennett,"Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2010","









  
  
    
  NOTE:  This is a review of the Kindle Edition of the book.  While it mentions the print edition, my rating is specific to the Kindle Edition.  If you are seeing this review listed in other editions of the book, please be aware that Amazon does this from time to time and unfortunately reviewers don't really have any control over it.The 48 Laws of Power is a fascinating journey through human history.  Its means of breaking up the lessons to be learned into ""Laws"" makes it both entertaining to read and a fascinating treatise on the nature of how people manipulate one another to achieve their goals.  I would hope anyone reading The 48 Laws of Power quickly figures out that this is not an instruction manual on ""How to Conquer the World, All By Yourself""--it's entertaining, it's informative, but it's far from a get-rich-quick device.That said, one of the areas in which I am lacking in life has been the ability to truly understand and anticipate people's actions.  I can tell you that this book has greatly helped me to understand human nature a little better, and has even been useful helping me figure out when someone is trying to manipulate me.  I've been surprised at how much more I seem to be picking up on when it comes to others' personalities.  It also amazes me how across cultures and across the millenia, human nature stays very much the same.Unfortunately, the Kindle Edition of this book (which is where this review was written) is dreadful.  Typos are not a problem, but there are whole sections of this book that somehow got mangled in translation and it's clear no one took the time to proofread it.  The print edition of this book (which I also own) contains sidebars along the margins of many pages. For the Kindle edition, these side pieces are ungracefully dumped in the middle of a passage.  The mangled portions of this book are often unintelligible.I contacted Amazon about this and they responded that they unfortunately do not have any control over how well the publisher converts their products to the Kindle Edition.  It's cut back on my desire to purchase Kindle products unless and until the quality improves, and I do not recommend the Kindle edition of this book for this reason.  The print version, however, is certainly well worth the read.

    Saved my Life!
  
",5.0,Billy,"Reviewed in the United States October 25, 2013","









  
  
    
  If I say this book saved my life it would seem like an exageration, but that's exactly how I feel about it.  Contrary to what some reviewers might write, in my opinion and experience this book doesn't turn you into a monster, but rather informs you well enough to see the monsters around you, how they operate in all manner of obvious or subtle ways to take advantage of you, and how you can avoid or deal with them.  Basically, it doesn't tell you to create pot-holes for others to stumble upon or fall into, but opens your eyes to see the pot-holes and how to navigate your affairs safely around them.  My business partner is a modern-day Shylock -- a manipulating, lying, greedy opportunist -- who doesn't hesitate to grab all she could under the disguise of a very sweet, caring friend who constantly says ""oh, you're like family to me;"" but underneath it all she's just hoping you'd make that one irretractable mistake of signing away your whole life to her.  If you're peace-loving and easy-going, a lot of people hardly ever fail to mistake your meekness for weakness, and even ride you like a donkey to their glory if they can.  I don't know about you, but it really hurts tearfully when you suddenly wake up to the realization that you've been taken for the fool of the century all along.  Thanks to this book for helping me see what's been going on.  And a very special thanks to my friend, Marie Guillaumes, the Editor of Illuminatista: Mind Alchemy by Juliette and Julie Williams, who listened patiently to my predicament and recommended this book to me.

",5.0,M. A. ZAIDI,"Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2003","









  
  
    
  The book deals with each of the 48 laws with a very wide selection of parables, myths, anecdotes and stories from all over the world and form all times, illustrating the unchanging dynamics of power over the centuries. It features Chinese warlords, Roman and renaissance-Italian power-mongers, American and European conmen, famous courtiers from the French courts before the Revolution, and even musings by Thomas Edison. And of course, the book pays tribute to the power-writer of all time, Niccolo Machiavelli.Learning the game of power requires a certain way of looking at situations and shift of perspective. To master the art takes effort, which requires certain basic skills, once mastered one is able to apply the laws of power.  The most fundamental of this skill is the ability to master your emotions.  An emotional response to a situation is the greatest barrier to power, a mistake that will cost you a lot more than any temporary satisfaction you may gain by expressing your feelings.  Emotions cloud reason, and if you cannot see the situation clearly, you cannot prepare for and respond to it with any degree of control.Anger is the most destructive of the emotional responses, for it clouds your vision the most.  It has a ripple effect that invariable makes situation less controllable and heightens your enemy's resolve.  Love and emotions are potentially destructive in that they blind you to the often self-serving interests of those whom you least suspect.The writings by Greene are an essential guide to power play.  They can help one be astute, alert, manipulative, cunning and provide an ability to strategize with the end goal in mind.  A clear grasp and understanding of the situation is a must.  The rhythm of power requires an alteration of force and cunning.  Too much force creates a counter-reaction; too much cunning no matter how well thought makes it predictable.The 48 Laws of Power is very cynical and depicts a world without mercy. The book is written in a manner so as to inspire the reader to achieve great power with an iron fist by talking directly to the reader, much like a self-help tape. Despite this belligerent and unabating tone, and the fact that it takes over 500 pages to get through all the laws, it is very readable, very clear in its message and the laws in it are not to be easily refuted.

I'm realizing all the mistakes I've made and surprisingly they would have been easy to avoid had I just had a little bit of knowledge before entering my career.I didn't feel that the laws were a serious threat to my morals.  Some of them, if taken to the extreme, certainly would be.  For the most part though, the majority of the laws can be used sparingly without feeling like you are selling your soul to the devil.I suggest taking personal notes after reading each law.  Reflect on the law and write down some ideas of how you can apply it to your life, decide if you are willing to use the law or if it violates your own personal morals, think of ways to defend against others who may use the law on you, think of ways that using the law might backfire on you, etc.  I did this and it was a huge help.  By the time I was done with the book I had a nice personal summary and ""power plan"" written out for myself.I noticed some reviewers who thought the laws sometimes contradicted themselves.  I agree to a point.  Sometimes they did.  I suppose the word ""laws"" makes it seem like they are set in stone and should always be true.  I tended to think of these laws more of tactics.  Some tactics work in certain situations and in other situations a contradicting tactic may be more suitable.I also found it extremely eye opening to the violence of life in the past.  If anything it made me more grateful for living in a modern and more civilized society.  Sure, the deception, back stabbing, and lies are still here today but at least you don't have to worry about getting your head chopped off.  At least when you get stabbed in the back today, it's metaphorically.  I mean, every story ended with at least one person getting their head chopped off or drowned or impaled with a spike.  Unbelievable.  I'm not just talking about lowly peasants either.  The kings / emperors / generals / courtiers / all seemed to be gambling with their life on a daily basis.  P*ss off the wrong person and your head went in a basket.

  This book is great. I love reading and was searching for what to read and stumbled upon this masterpiece. I'm not a fan of modern day books, but this one changed my perspective.BEWARE! YOU MUST TAKE THINGS LIKE A GRAIN OF SALT! Robert Greene makes sure you become aware of this, each and every law, when applied on the day to day basis, must be carefully practiced. For everything you do, you musn't exaggerate.

  This book is like a window into human nature. It explains how most people react to everyday situations by using their wit to gain power and  giving examples of historic events, socialism, and philosophy . Then it breaks it down by giving you the reason for these peoples actions and  cautionary tail that states the pro's, and con's of the actions taken .  In all It's a book that explains the ways that people have used to gain power throughout history and gives it relevance in our modern times . It also gives you a way to protect yourself from these power hungry people by giving you warning signs of their approach .That's the way I see it .

    Survive and Thrive In a Competitve World
  
",5.0,onevoguer,"Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2008","I picked this book up for $1, proof that there is no correlation between cost and value.

This would be the book that Machievelli would have written, had he courted the Aristocracy of his times, rather than attempting to ingratiate the Prince.

The author gives a hint to his motivations for this composition when he states in his acknowledgments:

""Finally, to those people in my life who have so skillfully used the game of power to manipulate, torture and cause me pain over the years, I bear you no grudges and I thank you for supplying me with the inspiration for the 48 Laws of Power.""

This book is cathartic. But before diving deeper, a reader should be prepared to entertain the following ideas:

1. A Human being is no more than a sophisticated animal with self-interest as the primary motivator
2. Everyone wants more power, not less
3. Be true to yourself first and foremost, don't be a sucker
4. Power is a game and the better you play, the better your life will be
5. Power is essentially amoral and one of the most important skills to acquire is the ability to see circumstances rather than good or evil
6. To triumph, it is necessary alternate between being both cunning and formless
7. Beyond linear dualities of good and evil, there is a third dimension, the strategists' mind
8. The indirect path, that of influence is more effective and the use of it is an art

If you can live with the above, the 48 laws of power serves as a handbook on the arts of indirection.

This book argues that by mastering ones emotions, understanding the people involved and the fundamental dynamics of interrelationships within society determine the extent of ones accomplishments. Power is ultimately an artificial construct, given legitimacy by the people who participate in the game.

We need power to survive in a competitive world that is constantly seeking to recruit us into the ambitions of others. We can drain our lives in the fulfillment of others, or best use our given life, energy and talents at our own discretion. Implicit to this design is the belief that society defaults a role to you, whether or not that role reflects your beliefs and understanding about yourself. A choice then has to be made on your part to accept such a role or to resist whether in an active or passive way. In the latter sense, one will turn upon themselves. It is better then to assert some degree of control by exercising influence and demonstrating an identity that is consistent with the person whom we feel ourselves to be, in other words, to actualize ones' self. Although this end state transcends any particular identification, characterization or ego, the path to it requires a struggle and this book is about the methods and devices used by successful participants. The good news is, the struggle can be worthwhile, rewarding and the unexpected consequences enlightening.

The perfect archetypical master of the laws of power is the Courtier, who possesses more than anything, a talent to influence. Cognizant of how he is perceived at all times in a socially competitive world, the Courtier is ever vigilant to monitor his own effect, ever mindful of the elusiveness of power. I believe that this is what the author means by the Courtiers mirror.

The core realization is that more than anything, human beings are the most social of animals, so it goes without saying that the most socially adapted animal attains the best that life has to offer. Human beings also possess Consciousness to such a heightened degree, that they can deliberately break and follow a path in defiance to their instincts and conditioned or learned behaviors, unlike animals.

In a paradoxical way, learning to play the game of power teaches virtues of mindfulness, patience and mastering ones ego. In this sense, the book permits another legitimate path to the completion of ones life without blindly accepting a given religion.

Well written, argued and referenced, it is abundantly clear how the author reaches his conclusions. It is highly accessible and well digested for the reader. There is a great deal of truth to the idea that a book serves as a mirror for the reader and I am hard pressed to argue against the wisdom contained in this manual. There is great peace of mind to be had from accepting fundamental truths.

Some would read this book and walk away with the impression that this is a ""how to"" on manipulation. Beware of such people, as their delusions make them a danger to themselves and anyone who places trust in them. You need not become a con artist to derive benefit from what is contained here. The laws of cause and effect and the aphorism of ""Know thyself"" are embedded as living proof, ignore them to your peril.",

  Robert Greene spends the entire book reminiscing on powerful people throughout the ages so one can learn from history instead of being doomed to repeat it.While I must say that this is one of the most useful and fun books I've read in a long time, the fact that he teaches powers compliment, subserviency, leads me to believe that Robert himself is pompous. As a ""master"" myself, as Robert would say, I have no intention of ""beheading"" my workers for going above and beyond the call of duty. Quite the opposite - I reward those generously who work to grow within the company. If one of them kissed my feet, I'd send them away as I'll not have people worshiping me.You know what ""masters"" want from their employs? Work. The single greatest thing you can do to make your boss smile is to simply work. So many people take on a job only to sit there watching TV and not working on what they're supposed to do, and as any steward of a company, I have one of my managers send them away.As for the rest of the book, if you can get through the overzealous nature, and even downright evil nature of some things, you can learn some very interesting information.

  I find the subject matter that Mr. Greene writes about to be interesting, but I found it also to be more ""highbrow"" than necessary at times.  His strategies are solid (they're basic manipulation techniques), but I think more modern references outside of the European courts of the 17th and 18th century might make the book a bit more digestable for most.  However, I must give the author credit for not dumbing down the subject matter so much that ANYONE could understand it.Needless to say though, with a little bit of interest in history this book is an easy read.  Wouldn't use it as a guide for living, but at least you can spot these strategies in others when they arise.

  An eye opener. This book shows the true nature of mankind. Manipulation is what we do from childhood and into adulthood. We haven't changed how we interact with others for thousands of years. To deny this is to place your head in the sand.

  48 laws of powerI will not begin this review with a list of the 48 laws but I will tell you that this is one effective book. True we are past the age of kings and queens and royal courts are no longer dens of aristocracy striving for power . None the less there are small fiefdoms , work places and parties where people jockey for position and power. The quest for power has to be in a civilized fashion. Outburst and violence will not be tolerated.The book starts off each chapter with the given law of power then goes into application. The first application is transgression, what happens when you fail to follow the law. After that the author goes into how to properly observe the law and apply it. In some chapters it does talk about reversing the law.Every chapter is filled with incidents pulled from history. On the side lines are fables and stories that help illustrate the point. The history alone makes this book top notch. Macciavelli, Baltasar Gracian, aesops fables are richly quoted here. mr. Greene is a student of the history of power.I cannot enthusiastically reccomend this book enough.  Mr. Greene has several other books out and I plan to read them . No matter your walk of life or aspiration you will get something out of this.

  I saw the author Robert Greene interviewed last week and it became clear that wisdom gleened from this book would be helpful in business and in life.  I'm just about half-way through and it doesn't disappoint.  Hundreds of historic stories used to explain each Law.  I started the book by reading the Laws pertinent to my life.  Now I'm reading the ones I glossed over.If you're ambitious and / or looking to understand how power is used by others against you, this book will open your eyes to the why and how behind it and who it benefits.  Would Recommend.

  There are a lot of other great reviews on here, including the 1 star reviews (which is unusual...) so I'll let people be a lot more vocal than me in describing the pros and cons of this book.I think there is a difference between liking the material in this book, and having respect for it's contents and construction.  The book is very well written, but it's contents may be offensive to certain people and a gold mine to others.There is no doubt that anyone putting these tactics and principles to work in their everyday life will result in them being something of a sociopath and a megalomanic.  If you are an incredibly ambitious person who seeks power and domination at all costs, then this book will be your bread and butter!  (I am NOT one of those people.)However, even if you find the inner workings of this book offensive and anti-social, the books is STILL valuable as a resource that you can use to find out what games other people are playing against YOU.  In that respect, I would still put this book high on a list of books you should read.  If you want to swim with the sharks and not get eaten, this book will illuminate what you need to look for to protect yourself from ambitious power mongers.If you really want to have personal power without resorting to Machiavellian tactics, I would recommend ""Aikido In Everyday Life"" by Terry Dobson and Victor Miller.  That book shows how to use the principles of the martial art Aikido to be strong and in harmony with others (and to totally kick ass in almost any situation!) without having to be an upward mobility seeker or sociopathic power monger.If you want to be a U.S. Senator, then THIS book is for you!  (Yes, I am disgusted with our government.)Peace!

  This book is entertaining to read as well as informative. The formalistic approach to each chapter gives it a stylized edge, and Greene plays this up in his writing voice, which keeps the discussion from becoming depressing or inhuman. Some of his laws contradict each other subtly though, it would have been nice to see some discussion of how laws conflict and what that means.

  Wow is all I can say about this book. I wish I had read this years ago. This is like my secret weapon that I almost don't want to tell anyone else about. I've already used some of the laws to my success. This book is simply amazing. I won't go too deep into the actual 48 laws of power. That you can discover for yourself. I'll talk about some of the other great features of the book.1) It outlines 48 rules that will help you create and maintain power over yourself, over others, and your environment2) The author supports these rules with interesting historical anecdotes3) The book is outlined in such a way that you can easily skip around to the rules most relevant to you. However it's recommended to read the book in it's entirety4) The overall layout of the book is captivating, with the main laws of power, their anecdotes, and then fables, poems and smaller examples in the margins, with each chapter closing with a unique twist.After getting half way through The 48 Laws of Power, I came back to Amazon and purchased Robert Greene's ""The Art of Seduction"" and preordered Greene's ""Mastery"".

",5.0,A. Ingram,"Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2009","









  
  
    
  I recommend this book for anyone who desires to gain power and understand what is necessary to keep that power under your control. I also recommend this book for anyone who just wants to know how the powerful operate. Yes the book deals with power and the keys to gain power in Machiavellian terms but the game of power is cutthroat like that. The book is also helpful in that it also offers warnings on how the steps to gain power can backfire on you. If You are serious in your attempts to gain power then I recommend this book.

  Anecdotal mostly.The 44 rules of power is not only a guide for war and conflict, but also a practical explanation of how the rules can be applied to everyday life in both business and personal interaction.  There are several examples of the rules as expressed in history. Each chapter has references from modern day business moguls to ancient Chinese warlords.If we can't learn from people such as Lincoln, Galileo and Napoleon, who can we learn from? If the greatest people of the last few hundred years cannot teach us, who can teach us? Take my advice and pick up this book before you start your next ethical debate or participate in any social event at all.  Even if just for the stories, this is a great read.

    A Must Read for People With a Purpose
  
",5.0,Brian V.,"Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2014","









  
  
    
  Downloaded this book at the suggestion of one of my students last night.  Really like it.  Caught me off guard as it is written in a similar style(in my opinion) as the  ""Art of War"" (one of my favorites) is written in.  Based on the author's bio was expecting something more trendy, but once I went back and read the preface the style made sense in that he is cherry picking some of the best ideas about power over the last 3000 years - not just pop-culture stuff.What I really liked about it is a reader can just pick off one of the laws per day, and dive as deep into each as one wants. Any one of the 48 can increase someone's awareness, an help them better achieve their purpose.  Nice to have a book that has more than just one main idea and 155 pages of dribble surrounding it (like most bestselling business books).In summary, this is going on my informal book recommendation list.  I think it is one of those few books that I have seen that is interesting enough to actually make time to read in a few days, but will take a life to master.  Wish I had this book when I was in my 20's.Best,Brian Vanderjack, PMP, MBA  Recent HBR Linkedin ""Top Contributor"" (out of 500,000 member community)  Email: BVanderjac@Gmail.com (put ""48"" in the subject and will read your replies)  Linkedin: [...]Ps.  FYI  - There are about 1000 versions of the ""Art of War,"" and their approaches to the material vary widely.  If you are interested in checking it out, definitely skim a few of them at the library to find one that works for you before you invest in one.

  I do not suggest you read this and take its advice seriously, as most of it is 'how to be a jerk and get away with it'.

  The 48 laws of power may not be nice, they may not be what you aspire to, and they may not be the world in which you wish to live.  Unfortunately, Robert Greene has nailed down 48 truisms that need to be understood by anyone responsible for managing, leading, selling, cajoling or subjected to any of those things.Greene takes the best and worst of human psychology and masterfully integrates lessons from history, quotations from classical literature and an entertaining if somewhat pedantic writing style to make the reader alert to the approach.  Reminding this reviewer of the tone taken by Machiavelli in ""The Prince"", Greene aims to both instruct and entertain while not passing moral judgement on the contents.Learn the 48 laws.  Understand that they are derivative of our nature, sociology and psychology, and accept that the information in the book is useful - if at times unpleasant to comprehend.

  The lessons taught in this book, though described through examples of highly historical observances and transgressions, are highly applicable to everyday life, especially in the workplace interactions.  While reading this book I was able to recognize my own personal observances and transgressions of each law, and I was able to analyze how I could better handle similar situations in my own life.  The examples used in the book often tie together, using many of the same powerful historical figures creating personality profiles for these influential people such a Fouche, Tallyrand and Napoleon.  I learned a lot!

  This book can be unsettling. Sometimes a particular law goes against your basic human decency. But the book makes no excuses, nor should it. This is not a book about understanding ethics or morality, it is a book about how power is increased. Each of the laws do, in fact, increase the user's power. Even if you do not feel comfortable using a particular law, it is very useful to be able to recognize when it is being used against you.Since I have read this book I have noticed a difference in my professional life. I feel more in control which has made me happier both at and away from work. I've read too many books that could not make that kind of difference to not recommend this one.

",4.0,Vince S.,"Reviewed in the United States May 2, 2014","









  
  
    
  The way to read this book is to look at the 'Laws' as options presented by the author.The book is divided into chapters that discuss each 'law.' While the word 'law' really makes the idea seem universal and absolute, these are really options and tactics. Following the description of the tactic is a set of historic parables and fables that demonstrate the application of it.The exercise for the reader is to figure out the best situations to apply each tactic. The purpose of this book is to really expand your thinking and make you aware that certain options exist. Many of us immediately dismiss certain actions as unconscionable or unethical, but this author challenges that dismissal. He wants us to think about all of our options objectively in the context of our overarching goals, and not be too quick to dismiss ideas out-of-hand.

  one of the best book about these matters. Only the 36 chinese stratagems can be defined as more intuitive (even if more difficult to understand in everyday life). This book will unveil a bitter truth about human beings: all human beings, included your family, your friends, colleagues...all of us search for personal satisfaction, which could be money, sex, political power. Based on this assumption, a lot of behaviours could be observed. Most of them have common roots. This book not only list them but give you clear and (interesting) examples, through human history. Which is to say: hey guys, we all know that this sucks, but we are not the only ones to behave in this way...look at Napoleon, Talleyrand, Sun Tzu, look at Michelangelo, etc, etc. As Baldasar Gracian said (also reported into this book)...most of our power in society is not based on what we DO, but on what we avoid to DO. I suggest this work without any basic arguments.

Admittedly, this is somewhat true (you most likely aren't reading a book like this if you aren't looking for a way to influence other people more effectively) however the way a person chooses to apply these laws is really what determines their morality.  Even some of the seemingly duplicitous laws are in fact fairly innocuous.  Take for instance, taking the credit for other people's work.  On the surface, this appears to be rather despicable.  But if you've ever read a self-help book or attended a motivational seminar, and then applied the principles you learned, then you have used this law.  This in fact, is one of the best aspects of The 48 Laws of Power; at no point does Greene try to tell the reader what's right and wrong...only what works.Content aside, the book is laid out and reads well.  As you would expect each law gets its own chapter.  Chapters are broken down into a brief description of each law backed up by historical examples of transgressions and observances concluding with Green's personal thoughts.  There are also anecdotal stories and poems in the margins.  While the examples of transgressions and observances do a good job of illustrating the point, I found Greene's commentary to be extremely insightful as well.  Most chapters can be read in thirty minutes or less which leads me to another positive aspect of this book; you can read a chapter right before you go to bed and literally begin applying it the very next day.  Even if you don't apply them you will most certainly notice people following or (more often) breaking them.As far as the laws' effectiveness I don't have personal experience with them all, though the ones I have applied work great.  Many of them are situational.  Others aren't always necessary (that is to say, following them will certainly help your cause but ignoring them won't necessarily be detrimental).  Still others are indispensable and not following them will at a minimum limit your potential (particularly in the work place).  48 Laws is basically a human psychology book and how you use it is really up to you.  In my opinion, if you change even one pattern of behavior as a result of reading it then it was worth the money.  And even if you don't, it will at least give you new insight on human interaction.

  Wow, I can't believe I finished! I've been chipping away at this book for probably six years now. It is amazingly researched and organized, a great compilation for either offensive or defensive maneuvers in life. The only reason it took me so long to read is because it is DARK. When I got to the example of a concubine in ancient China poisoning a baby because it was an heir to the throne, I had to take a break. There is no way I am willing to go that far to gain power, and doing battle against someone who would is an unsettling concept.Greene specifically states that his books are amoral, not immoral, and that may technically be true. Still, whenever I felt my soul shriveling into a crumpled, blackened speck, I knew it was time to read something more positive for a while. Therefore, I had a very on-again off-again relationship with this work. But these are the rules of life they didn't teach us in school, and I can't wait to start ""The 33 Strategies of War.""

If read in the book in the right mindset, it can get you in the flow of universal in which the book talks about.However, if the reader is not emotional or mentally balanced the power will be out of their reach.Such is the way of Power.Do not underestimate the power of this book.This is an excellent book that needs to be read and read and then read some more.I have used the techniques offered in this book on how to gain power, and I have to admit, it works. Not only does most of the laws work, it s suppressing how easy it is to attain success and power.This is a book to be studied, not just read once. If you want to really get in touch with Power.Overall, excellent book. Some chapters are a little out there for me. Read what you like and leave the rest, s the best way to read this book.No pun intended, but this is a Powerful book.

  Indeed, these laws do work and are dark (well, some are in the gray zone). I subtracted a star because the book omits the few ways of gaining power that not only does not involve manipulating, deceiving, and lying, but also helps others.Anyway, anyone who wants to do anything that involves interdependence on others (about 99% of people) should read this book...if only to create a defense against those that follow the Dark path to power.

    Packed full of wisdom throughout the ages. Both unabridged and abridged editions are excellent
  
",5.0,bumandy,"Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2015","









  
  
    
  ""The 48 Laws of Power"" was a wake-up call for me. It reminded me of Machiavell's ""The Prince"" which I read in high school. However, I thought ""The Prince"" had no relevance to my life since I did not need to decide whether or not to chop the head off a defeated king.Robert Greene's book helped to make the connection between Machiavelli's principles and methods and what I have experienced in my professional career. While nearly everyone claims to be straightforward and honest, some are adept at maneuvering themselves into advantageous positions. ""The 48 Laws"" explains the many tools these individuals use to increase their power, usually at the expense of yours. I have found the most valuable books to help me learn about life through the experiences of others and this book is packed full of wisdom throughout the ages.Several of the 48 laws that were insightful to me were:Law 1 - Never outshine the masterLaw 4 - Always say less than necessaryLaw 9 -  Win through your actions, never through argumentLaw 16 - Use absence to increase respect and honorLaw 20 - Do not commit to anyoneLaw 29 - Plan all the way to the endLaw 38 - Think as you like but behave like othersLaw 46 - Never appear too perfectLaw 48 - Assume formlesslessA few of these may sound obivious, silly, puzzling. However, there are plenty of historical examples to explain each law (in the form of ""observance of the law"", ""violation of the law"", and ""reversals""). I may use a few of the laws in the future but mostly, I will be aware of the laws to watch my back.Both the unabridged and abridged versions are excellent - 'Machiavelli's ¨'The Prince¨ on steroids. If you have the time, go with the unabridged edition because it has many more historical examples. However, if you are time constrained, the abridged version is terrific as well.I first listened to the abridged version and found it to have many pearls of wisdom. As the author suggests, I identified many examples of the laws in my professional and academic career. I wished I had read (or listened) to this book earlier in my youth.I then listened to the unabridged version because I was interested in the full text and it did not disappoint with many more historical examples - ¨the wise learn from the mistakes of others.¨

  This book is great in my opinion because of the constant references that the author provides to give the reader a visual of each ""law"". It allows the reader to fully understand how to use each ""law"" in multiple ways. If I had to say I disliked something about this book, it would be the same thing I like about it. Since there are so many references as ideas, the book is dense, thus being an extremely long read. I would recommend this book to anyone who needs guidance with how to execute their goals.

Only buy these book if that is truly what you want in your life, not just to buy for the fun of it. I would use this seller again top purchase books from. Packaging was wonderful, and the book came in perfect condition for the price I paid for it.

  Fantastic book. I see people doing these things every day and even if I don't choose to use these techniques or laws I can at least identify and protect myself from them. I let my friends borrow my first copy a lot so I decided to get a second one of my own. Wonderful book. I have learned a lot about how often humans manipulate each other.

",4.0,Zach,"Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2017","









  
  
    
  I give this four stars mainly because I was bothered by formatting and the examples given in the book.  The laws themselves are well thought out and backed up with examples, but nearly every anecdote in the book brings the reader back 500 years into a time that wasn't necessarily relatable.  I give the author credit in the sense that history repeats itself and the examples are still valid, but it would have been nice to read a mix of contemporary and a mix of historical anecdotes.  I just found the book a little bit slow given I was reading about kings and queens and wars the entire time.  Power is a subject applicable to ALL domains, and I felt this book was a bit narrow.Also, I found it very distracting how the author includes one-off snippets between stories that are totally unrelated.  It disrupts the flow of the book.All that said, this book is well worth the read.  I just wouldn't suggest reading it like a normal book.  This is one of those books you just have to pick up over and over again and read little snippets of.

  Great Book! I had bought this book through a recommendation from my cousin and it turned out to be a very enlightening read.Though lengthy in nature, the book is thoroughly organized and expansive, providing key learning points with great anecdotes to get the point across. Each chapter is an aspect of ""Power"" and is demonstrated through multiple stories with a quote that exemplifies the point trying to get across the to the reader.As for the pricing, I paid about 20$ for the paperback edition which has held up pretty well. It could be cheaper but regardless the book is a great seller and the quality of the content will justify your investment in knowledge.Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone interested in the psychology of power.

",4.0,Miles Benate Tyson,"Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2016","









  
  
    
  Reading this book was fun, although sometimes it made me feel like a bad person. Some sentences are written like ""and then your unsuspecting sheeplike victim will never see it coming""...and for me that sort of language is a bit extreme. Why must power be equated with evil? Anyhow, I especially enjoyed the historical examples Greene uses to support his ideas. In terms of content, I cannot at the moment name more than two or three laws of power and their application. Now, I read this a few months ago, and few of the lessons seemed to stick with me. Maybe that's because there are 48 laws to memorize, or perhaps only a few jumped out at me. All in all, I liked the book, and internalized several of these laws of power.

  I am not sure if any other book has ever concentrated so much ""secret"" and powerful knowledge..Easily Assimilable Knowledge through historic paradigms.. Very strong messages that must be told in order to understand the power games that happen in life...A book that is a must for wannabe politicians, businessmen, social engineers and life-architects..The problem is that someone must somehow apply these theoretical arsenal in real-life situations and construct his personal laws.

If your life or your career have lost momentum then align your actions with the principles in this Book Of Life and the sin of powerlessness will be bannished.

",3.0,Ed,"Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2015","









  
  
    
  The content could have been more condensed. It gets boring reading speculative theories about power which are either entirely intuitive to begin with or impractical. The author spreads a depressing worldview where the goal of life is to deceive and manipulate everyone around you, while ignoring the forms of power which are available in life through more virtuous paths. What I like about the book is that it offers a very diverse selection of fables and historical stories from across many times and societies which clearly illustrate power.

    Like the bible for jerks, but sadly true.
  
",4.0,Austin Post,"Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2013","









  
  
    
  This book is like the bible for jerks. Basically everything that Jesus was and taught this book is the exact opposite of. If you want to learn how to be a completely amoral person who seeks their own self-interest and only that, wherein others are mere pawns in the game of success that have no value whatsoever, this is the book for you. I think almost everything it teaches is morally wrong, but I gave it four stars anyway. The reason why is because almost everything in this book is true. I think there is a difference between truth and correctness. I believe if you follow the laws written in this book there is a very good possibility you will be successful. You might end up with no friends and a completely superficial identity, but it is the path to material success. In that sense it is true. I think it is not correct in that the morals of it are wrong. Essentially the problem with the ideas taught in this book is that it requires there to be dupes who do not follow these rules, because if everybody followed them society would collapse. What I would say is that if you don't want to be what is described in this book, you can use it to identify other people who are and steer clear of them or anticipate their moves before they make them. In that sense it is a good book even for the morally decent among us.

    Power corrupts. And absolute power ... well, you know.
  
",5.0,DeistMan,"Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2017","









  
  
    
  This book is a well written analysis of how power might be obtained and maintained. The negative reviews seem to believe that Greene is encouraging everyone to act immorally. I can see where certain people would believe this. What I took away from this book is that many people act in ways that may be harmful to us and if you better understand what they are doing, you stand a much better chance of removing yourself from danger.Of course, some people with delusions of grandeur will imagine that they can follow the ""rules"" of this book and go on to conquer the boardroom, the media or even the world. Good luck with that.The fact is that most people who operate in these theaters already know and practice all or many of the ""rules."" There is nothing new here for anyone who has been educated well since they will have already been exposed to Machiavelli and the many lessons of history. Still, this book is very entertaining and instructive.

  I must say I'm positively surprised by this book. Usually I do not care too much about reading.I do like to learn, I'm a very factual person so most books just can't catch my attentions as there's too much chit-chat that I really don't care about but this book seems to have hit the perfect balance.I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone who wish to learn more about how big personalities think and how you can learn from their mistakes and / or strong sides.Even if you don't agree to parts of this book I'd say if you run a business there's 99% chance / risk you'll run into some of the types / personalities as described in this book.

  Ok, let's say you want to read simply because you are bored. This book is filled full of factual stories about every law to show you how the law has been used throughout history. Extremely interesting stories about houdini, casanova, napoleon, Tallyrand, pt barnum, and a bunch of chinese people. Plus many many more. Freaking awesome book of stories.Besides the stories, each lesson will improve your life. Some laws will be more important than others, but they will help you become a more respected person overall.  You only have power if people like you and want to follow you. These lessons make people like you, therefore you can influence people better.  Amazing book, you will not believe how great this book is. I knew as I read the first page of the introduction that I will love this book. Do yourself a favor and just read the introduction, then decide if you would like this book. You owe yourself the valuable knowledge contained within these pages.

",5.0,JF,"Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2016","









  
  
    
  Purchased as a gift to one of my ROTC Cadets to begin their professional library. As part of a class assignment I asked each cadet what book would they no-kidding read, military or not, related to their academic major or not. After I compiled the list of books for the class I went online and ordered all the books from Amazon. I placed them at their seats prior to class and allowed them to enter the room w/o me being present for the first five minutes. It was, and still is, one of the good teaching moments of our time together. Thanks for helping me fulfill a need in their soon-to-be military career.

  I came across this book by accident and read it nonstop:  Sometimes my jaw dropped, sometimes I got so angry I wanted to rip the pages, sometimes I was just amazed. It really helped me to understand what really was happening at my workplace and why working hard was never enough.I strongly suggest this book to people who have Asperger's syndrome or people who may have difficulty understanding social interactions: It classifies the interaction types, provides formula(s) even.Even if you have morals and could not practice some of the suggestions, after reading this book, you will start seeing patterns in other people's behavior and their hidden agendas.This book changed me forever. I strongly suggest to everyone.

  This book actually has some good insights. The author does a good job of explaining the concepts in a way that makes sense - even if you don't agree with the suggestion. For those of us who are less scheming it sheds light on some bizarre behaviors that others exhibit. If you take this as an observational and educational experience then you do stand to learn a lot that can better prepare you to deal with certain characters that you may encounter in your business life or even on a personal basis.

",5.0,B. Saib,"Reviewed in the United States October 30, 2013","









  
  
    
  I have recommended and bought multiple copies of this book for many friends. Once you read it, it's like someone removed dark glasses from in front of your eyes. Suddenly history makes sense to me and politics even more. This book is not a novel and actually reads like a text book. It is amoral meaning that the information in it can be used either way. Not IMMORAL where the information can only be used for evil. The example I give is like this: This book is like money. One can used it to help others or use it to buy weapons to kill. Morality comes from your application of the knowledge. Gandhi was a master of the information in here, so was Napoleon and even Hitler. Don't read it fast. Take your time. It will change you too (for the better).

    What you actually want to know before buying the Kindle edition.
  
",3.0,Dirty Hairy,"Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2010","









  
  
    
  My review is based solely on the quality of the Kindle edition.  For the most part it is great.  There are a few little errors in spacing, spelling, and general format issues.  I'd say you get 2 or 3 for each ""law"".  The bigger problem is that there are a few spelling errors so egregious that you have no idea what the word is supposed to be.  That happens every 3 ""laws"" or so.  I gave it 3 stars because these mistakes are annoying enough that they should create a new Kindle edition, but not so bad you'd demand your money back.  If you are reading this, these are the types of reviews you should be writing for Kindle books.

  I heard about this book on one of my favorite radio talk shows. The host encouraged listeners to not use this book to harm others but as a tool to identify behaviors in others so you will know how to respond and conduct yourself around people with agendas. So Amazon was the first place I came to get a feel on what folks really think. I bought the book and began reading it with the intent as suggested by the talk show host and I am enjoying it. I enjoy the historical transgressions and observances of each law and the interpretations. I still see the scriptures as a blueprint on how to conduct myself in every aspect of my life, but I do enjoy this book.

    Greatest book ever written
  
",5.0,Ryan Masterson,"Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2013","









  
  
    
  I only say what I said in the review title because, well...it's the truth. Power is the truth of life. In fact, everything in existence runs on power. There is no structure or organization or person that fully and truly operates without power. Some people might think power is a dirty word. Or the things associated with it are less than one's morals. I'm here to tell you - grow up! Everyone practices power, whether they're conscious of it or not. Like the author said, ""There's no hope in opting out of the game. Far better to learn and excel at it."" This book will teach you how.

",5.0,Kori H.,"Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2018","









  
  
    
  The book came in very good condition, and fast. I enjoy the stories told within each rule, as they really help you remember the lesson and are entertaining to read. Some of them are a bit worrying, as they are about real events in history and you think about some of the horrible things that have happened to people... but in that light, following the rules in the book could help you avoid some of those more tragic fates, or at least take a more introspective approach at the behavior of others and yourself so that you might make better, or wiser decisions regarding certain situations.Really, it can really help you understand why people might act as they do and how to react in ways that won't screw you or the people you care about over.

  If you're an historical aficionado, you will love this book, although it's more of a hindsight chronicle of how certain powerful individuals manifested their epic legacies, rather than a guidebook.  Agonizingly detailed, voraciously researched, the lessons will be a bore to slow readers, replete with dense references and margin-notes (candy for dweebs!), but succeeds as a multifarious playbook on how to map your trajectory to world domination.  Many lessons/rules contradict one another and The 48 Laws of Power is above all a notebook of previously tried and true applications, many of which will not work in all situations and which require a discerning eye for proper application.  Nevertheless, for those refined individuals patient to read about the successes and failures of predecessors across the globe and throughout the annals of history, it is an undeniable gem of psycho-historical analysis. I recommend this book to anyone who must deal with people of power/money/status, and adults who've never mastered playing with children in the sandbox.

    The 3 Laws of Reviewing Robert Greene
  
",5.0,Vincent Poirier,"Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2007","









  
  
    
  1The law: Read Robert Greene's books lightly, dipping into them from time to time. Perhaps when you wake up in the morning, or before stepping out to go to work, or before going to bed. Don't read the books cover to cover in a few sittings. Let yourself absorb their lessons.Reversal: Read lightly but pay attention. Don't think yourself above these laws. Greene presents to a modern audience lessons from the classics of human literature. Do not dismiss the wisdom of ages lightly.2The law: Let the laws and strategies that Greene has sifted from the classics guide you in your everyday life. The lessons of the past have already been paid for. Do not reinvent the wheel.Reversal: Do not insist on applying a specific law to a specific problem. Let a situation choose its own solution. Do not force a square peg in a round hole.3The law: Empathize. When asking someone for something, for instance when emailing Greene hoping for a reply, offer them something of value to them.Reversal: Accept that anyone can refuse when asked for something. Robert Greene receives too much email to reply to all messages. Move on to another author.Image: A library full of other books.Vincent Poirier, DublinYes, yes. I used the same basic review for all three of Robert Greene's books. That's OK. Robert Greene wrote the same basic book three times. But at least it's three times the same good book.

",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2014","









  
  
    
  There are people who are so narcissistic and so ruthless that they will stop at nothing to get what they want, no matter how many people they harm on the way. This book will help you to recognize some of the patterns of behavior utilized by the excessively ambitious.One shortcoming of the book, I think, is that in some cases, the author used certain criminals and their endeavors as examples of successful acquisition of power. Surely, there would be many examples in the ""legal"" business community that would have served as well or better.

  i recommend this book to anyone who is tired of being controlled or being betrayed. this book teaches you how people control each other and how to play the game of life. there is a chapter in the book"" never trust friends too much- learn how to use enemies. this chapter will show you how to never confide in any friend totally and it will tell you why. nothing is wrong with a little manipulation,life is about moderation and life is a game. sometimes it's either play or be played. the book also shows why yellow kid weil was able to con people out of millions of dollars. the book has a historic context which shows you how men like otto von Bismarck applied the laws of power. there are 48 of them choose the ones you like and apply them. this book is not for the weak but its for the people who want to play the game of life and never lose.

  It does not matter if you want to play the game or not, you are in it. You don't have to take a sword with you but for heavens sake at lest wear some armor. This book is that armor, to understand the 48 laws allows you to see the oppertunity/danger before it is to late. NO, I WILL NOT HURT PEOPLE FOR GAIN but I will no longer be used if I can help it.I came in early and stayed late to get the job done. I have recieved great reviews and many promises of money and promotion. All for little. I noticed my peers, who were not as dedicated as I by their own admission, careers were moving along at the same pace as mine or faster. When I had enough, I began to talk to managers that I trusted and employees who have had success in career advancement. Guess what, their comments and advice were very similiar to many of the laws in this book.This book is very ""Practical"" and, while I admit, practicing many of these laws would be ""Dangerous"" and ""Shameless"" to ignore that they are present in our every day lives is delusional.

  I gave this book five stars for two reasons. The first is that this book paints society without the rose colored glasses we like to place on it. Its harsh and realistic. It paints a picture of humanity that is near perfect. It tells you how humans act and what human nature is, and it isn't pretty. Second the book is interesting and easy to read. Even if you disagree with Greene's viewpoints or his paradigm the histories presented are interesting and written in a easy to read well presented fashion.

  I love this book and own it in paperback.  But I bought the Kindle edition and am quite disappointed to find out how sloppily it is put together.  Many words that are intended to be italicized are not.  Extra lines are are put where they're not needed and are not put where they are needed.  Some words are misspelled, e.g., ""TOLSIOY"" for ""TOLSTOY"" (OCR error?).  The margin notes are interspersed at arbitrary places in the text, interrupting the flow, instead of doing something more reasonable like putting them all at the end of the chapter.  There is an index that is completely pointless since there are no references to where the words are used (it would have been better just to leave it out entirely).If I were the publisher, I would be embarrassed to have my name on this Kindle edition, regardless of price.  And how on earth can they charge $16.99 when they are not even doing basic proofreading?!? ...let alone actually putting some thought into adapting it to the Kindle?  Is this a joke?  I want my money back.

",5.0,Brandenburg,"Reviewed in the United States November 1, 2013","









  
  
    
  I have listened to the audiobook version of this great text when I was at university, though I didn't have the physical book, I found the 'laws' were naturally introduced to me via lots of short but interesting stories, despite it is hard to go back and forward and cross reference things without the book.I bought the paperback and now I also own the kindle version of the book. And I have read it twice. (I kept the paperback book as a useful reference in my small bookshelf which has not been increasing in quantity since I became an ebook reader.As I read the text, I can understand though the theories have been termed as 'laws', nothing is certain, the author has used lots of examples to illustrate examples which seems contradictory but it is really a true facet of working in any company/corporation: you need to see through the reality and make the right decision based on the conditions you are in.The only thing I am not satisfied about this book is the examples which are sometimes too far away from our times, if he could even make up examples, say, as a consultant in Goldman Sachs dealing with certain issues, that will make the book even more useful.I have to say, as a young graduate working for a big American firm and have seen the harshness of life in it along with my idealism forced to wither till its eventual vanquish in such a short span of 2 months, I recommend this as one of the principal texts in dealing with people. But don't be stubborn, no situation is exactly the same, you have to use the way of thinking illustrated in this book rather than following the 'laws' stubbornly and literally.

",2.0,K. Kline,"Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2018","









  
  
    
  I got myself through this book while commuting. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. The only thing that got me through it were all of the historical 1400's 1500's stories. I may have enjoyed a 2 hour book about manipulating people alongside a companion 4 hour book on cool historical people like Napoleon and that circus guy he wouldn't stop talking about. Putting it all together over the course of 24 hours was too much for me. Those are 24 hours that I could have been learning spanish or talking to my grandma. I understand why this book exists and why some people would want this sitting on their shelves, but it goes way overboard on normal social situations. I work in a government, military branch, so bits and pieces were relevant to previous careers or social situations, but not many. I guess if you're a NY banker trying to make partner you might want to look through a paper version of this book. Interpretation: Read something else.

  I'm the type who, ""buys me now, reads me later..."" type of book buyer.  I first tried to read Robert Greene's book some time back, I couldn't get into it. So I put it to the side for the time being....A)  In 2012 I began reading ""Sun Tzu For Success"" by Gerald Michaelson and Steven Michaelson. As a result my eyes were opened to the possibilities in how to see the big picture in the success planning. As well as how thinking in proactive mode can produce stronger results than  reaction thinking like most of us would do.B)  So when I finally read ""48 Laws"", it was like life-lessons reading in how to get along with people. Or how immature people will behave toward you. Which I never understood since most of us know about morals, ethics and family-values in our civilized society of the 21st century.C)  The biggest chapter for me was Law#24; ""Play the Perfect Courtier"". It's how to play internal politics either at work or in social groups. Wow!, what an eye opener.D)  Or how about Law#46: ""Never Appear Too Perfect"". Your efforts to be ambitious, successful or even just plain charming can create envy and people hating you for no reason but for you being at your best.E)  Another is Law#18:""Do Not Build Fortresses to Protect Yourself-Isolation is Dangerous"" It's what happens when you are work alone and cut yourself off. You lose ""being out of the loop"" from very important information to dominate from.F)  Even if you are a person of high character and a good person. Your friends and working peers won't always see the world the way you do. So protect yourself from these bad people.F)  SO YOU MUST BUY THIS BOOK!... IT'S TODAY'S BIBLE!So now I'm reading ""The New Boss"" by Peter Fischer. ""How To Survive the First 100 Days"" whether starting a new job or new to a group. I'm using ""48 Laws"" like a reference book for when I observe a behavior and ask why are they?... Combined I stand a better chance to not just survive but thrive in my ever changing environments!Enjoy!

  This book is extremely concise with all the common types of power plays known to modern socities. It is true that all the historical books on strategy and the royal court system can be anundated to today's standards. Outside of reading those books, this is the only way to get by. There's one warning though: If read by the wrong person, or for the wrong reasons, this book can be dangerous. It's like this; If you give a hammer to a Michaelangelo, he can use it to create a perfect masterpiece like the David or the Pieta. The same hammer in the hands of a madman would be used to crush someone's skull. It's all relaitive.This book is a tool, and like all tools, some responsibility and depth of character is required to keep it from being misused.

    Understanding how other people think
  
",5.0,Russ888,"Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2014","









  
  
    
  The title of this book could have been ""48 Methods Other People Use To Try To Have Power Over You"" because that's what it's really about. It's 48 things that people do to try to influence, control, or manipulate others. You can read an overview of the 48 laws in the ""Look Inside"" link on the book cover at the top of the page.I wish people didn't do these things. I wish people didn't act this way, but I've found out the hard way that people do. As one reviewer said, other people don't live by the same rules that I do. This has caused me problems in the past. Now I understand what I am sometimes up against, not always, not with everyone, but sometimes with some people.Reading this book caused me to think a lot. I remembered times I've seen other people do these things to others. I remembered times other people had power over me because of them. I thought about times I may have used these methods on others. Not all of them are bad. Some are smart and helpful like making your boss look good, or not outshining your boss (causing him or her to feel insecure and not like you and cause you trouble).Each law has a story or two describing what it's about and how it works. The examples are from a time in history when these power games were the social norm. We're talking from the 1600's and 1700's with Kings and Emperors and the common people. There must have been different social dynamics at play back then because some of the rules are totally whacked out. For example, they treated their friends as pawns in a game to use for their own advantage, and they recommended hiring your enemies because they would be more loyal than friends. Say what? They also said to guard your reputation, but hey, if you trash your friends to get ahead, you have no reputation, especially with FB and Twitter and blogs. So not everything can be applied in today's world, but there is enough value here to give it 5 stars.It certainly gave me a different viewpoint in life so I can be ready to work with different kinds of people. Different companies have more or less of these at play, depending on who the managers are. I think a bad environment can draw out the worst in people, and a wonderful company culture with a supportive environment can draw out the best in people. I don't believe a person posing as a friend, working as a spy, scheming to get ahead on the job would last very long in a company with a wonderful upbeat company culture. I also don't think a nice person (oblivious of these laws) would last very long in a company who thrives on competition between employees. What you don't know could hurt you.

    How can you not love this book? Use it for tips or humor and you win
  
",5.0,Rob Kirk,"Reviewed in the United States December 18, 2012","









  
  
    
  I absolutely loved this book. The irony is that in the ""grayness"" of what's right and wrong you actually can learn a lot from this book by using it's tips, knowing what mind tricks are being used on you or simply just reading the book as entertainment. It succeeds in all three areas. I do think it's a great idea to read this book slowly, perhaps one chapter a day to really absorb the information. In general, a very useful and entertaining book well worth your efforts.

  I was horrified, in the beginning, at the suggestions the author was making, e.g., ""crush your opponents.""  Then I realized how many of these tactics were being used on me.  Then I realized how many tactics I was doing on my own, (OK, the Disney version, but still....).  I was listening to it via Audible, but I bought a paper copy so I can refer to it when needed.

  This is a 14 year-old book that I, then my wife read. After 1330 reviews, what else might possibly be said?We'll ... maybe a lot. Notice that the reviews have trended up toward 5 stars after a sketchy 3-5 star beginning 13 years ago. Are the 48 Laws of Power more relevant now than 13 years ago?Reviewer's terms have morphed from using words like `evil' in some form to `practical' and `useful' today.  Are readers more aligned to the 48 Laws then they were in 2000?My wife and I have our own book club thing going so we've spent some time chatting about Greene's 48 Law's. We agree first, that Lucifer and the demons of Hell should have gotten some of the credits in the intro. However, Greene elucidates the Hellion's strategies so well that they are likely enthralled by the result since the low key, take no credit for injecting is one of the laws. That's not to say that we mere humans don't execute the possibilities of this list of management style temptations ... at least 2 or 3 a day ... maybe more.We agree second that the 48 Laws of Power is a masterpiece. It describes the ways and means to reap what you sow. it is so exceedingly rare that an author sticks to such ancient tried and true methods that really work without messing them up with ""New"" or ""Improved"" notions. This is hard core wisdom for the power seekers and office warriors.  You can love it or hate it simultaneously. Nonetheless,  it is worthy simply because it is so spot on for offence or defense in a wholly secular world.Great value for money ... a long read.

    Arse kissing to it's highest degree.
  
",3.0,Stacy M.,"Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2018","









  
  
    
  I give this book three stars because it is essentially a history book with stories of deception, manipulation, and arse kissing. There are many tactics one can borrow from this book but due to its many reversals at the end of each chapter, only some of the of the tactics will prove to be useful.The best advice I can give after reading this book is that one must aim to work for self and build ones own 'empire' because as you can see, the other route will inevitably isolate you if you do make it to the top. The saying, ""it's lonely at the top,"" has a profound subliminal message.The book is worth the purchase nonetheless.

  Power is always the game. Sometimes understanding the powers at play can allow you to move out of the way for safety or in to play when it's your time. I really enjoyed this book it felt like I was in a History Channel documentary that covered the Laws of Power going back to the beginning. Incredible account of how the laws of power haven't changed ever and those through history that recognize that have become the people we remember through history and change the world. Start with the 80/20 version first it is much shorter and will grasp your interest for sure.

",2.0,D. A. Escamilla,"Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2018","









  
  
    
  I am listening to the audio book of this, and I don't care for the presentation of the material very much.  Instead of explaining a ""law of power"" and then indicate how you can model yourself to use it or persuade others, from what I have listen to so far, it instead is framing it as how you should lie and deceive others to achieve power. In general, it seems to be taking a negative instead of a positive slant to the presentation of the material.  Keep in mind, I am only on chapter 6 of 49 at this point, so perhaps it will get better.

  This should be your business bible, as I was reading it I thought, ""Surely most people don't think this way."" But as I dived deeper into it I could see patterns in my day, whether people know it or not, they use a lot of these principles on a daily basis. The real master of power can take this book and hone their craft to use the principles as well as know when they are being used. Caution use at your own discretion, you may be perceived as a schmuck.

  My local public library used to have 5 copies. They have all been stolen. I work as a correctional officer in a county jail. This book is very popular among the inmates. It's mostly for that reason I considered it a must read. If you're a kleptomaniac, you can steal it. If you're a pyromaniac, you can burn it. If you're a masochist, you can have someone read it to you, If you're a sadist, you can read it to someone. If you have a Pollyanna view of human nature, you'll most likely not like this book. It will make you think. It's worth many of the history lessons alone.

  Robert Greene does it again. This book is filled with true ""laws"" that you can observe in everyday society. Regardless if you agree if the laws are ""right or wrong"" morally is beside the point. These laws are a bit dark and somewhat Machiavellian but they are very applicable to modern day society. Knowing the laws from this book will help you understand the dynamics of power, how to use it, or how to defend yourself from those that try to use it against you. Even if you aren't looking to gain power, this book is still eye opening. I highly recommend this book to anyone.

  You would figure the author of such a powerful book would be at the pinnacle of power, but is not quite; the truth in the world is LOVE: fear does not create the creation love brings. FEAR only creates rushed uncomfortable action. Respect is earned from a love that sets boundaries against those who oppose it.I got this book 2-3 years ago and have recently begun to see it in a different light, a more factual light: that Greene's idea of the world is simply based on the negative ideas he had which led him to write: 48 art of seduction

  Very informative in how to get what you want by any means necessary and would be an excellent tool if you are seeking becoming a Politician.

  Not what I was expecting. Uses a lot of ""real world examples"" that happened hundreds or thousands of years ago that I find difficult to believe as there is no real way to prove that A. they ever happened or B. that the events happened in the way the book describes. There is a lot of good reading in the book, but I found myself sometimes just skimming through his examples, as it seemed as though much of them were just fluff.

    History lesson that grade schools don't teach
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2017","









  
  
    
  I love this book because he uses years of history dating back all the way to the early stages of AD to back up each law of power. I've learned so much history in this one book more than I have probably in grade school. It provides you with a different outlook on life and how to put the ball in your court when it comes to the laws of nature. A must read for everybody.

  This book was recommended to me by a former legislative aid of the Georgia General Assembly.  The rules are provided in the form of parables but taken from history from ancient times to modern (first half of the 20th century).  I found it very instructive as I'm part of a national dance organization which is highly political.
