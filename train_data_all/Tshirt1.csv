  These run small and shrink a bit when dried. I dried one on accident and won’t make that mistake!! I recommend buying a size up. Husband has a more sturdy build b not huge. He’s a large and they come up when he raises arms. They keep him dry so that’s a great part!

  These shirts seem to be relatively descent, but they are definitely not sized correctly. Make sure you order a larger size than regular because they are much tighter than they should be even if you account for a good fit. I guess they could be useful as something to aspire to lose some weight. Lol.

  I really like that the shirts stretch, but they're wayyyyy too small.  (I looked for a notation that the shirts wouldrun small, etc., but didn't see one).  I usually wear a XL, but figured I'd order XXL for some extra room.  But,even the XXL size is wayyyy too small.  The shirts seems to be about the size of a regular Large, so make sureto account for this when you order.

  I knew I would be getting cheap shirts, I mean look at the cost, but I figured the way I sweat I’d get maybe 10 good washes out of them and then they’d be well on their way to being junk. So it goes. Well, I put the first shirt on and there were loose strings hanging from all different parts of the shirt. The next shirt had a super loose neck but everything else fit fine. The next had strings everywhere again. The last two were fine (I thought) Aaaaaand then by the second wash all 5 shirts were coming apart, the strings wrapping around other pieces of clothing and tearing into delicates in my washing machine. A total and complete waste of money, time, and fabric.

  This is my second order of these great wicking shirts. This order had one shirt undersized. It was labeled as XXL but was much smaller than all of the others in this order and my previous one. It's not worth the hassle of returning, but heads up to the manufacturer/seller to be more careful on sizing. Otherwise, it is a great shirt at a fantastic price.

  Material quality is very good. They weave a black strand in with base color. Very high quality looking.

They are 1 XL or XL and fit comfortably. I bought Real essentials 2 XXL and they super small. Different countries hav3 different size patterns for sizes.

  Rookie error on my part in not noting the numerous issues folks have experienced with these t-shirts. They are not only way smaller than expected but the quality is poor. The collar hem is unevenly sewn and has a permanent wrinkle on two of them. The bottom hems have come out of three of the shirts. Giving a 2-star rating because the colors and material are as described. I would recommend another brand over these for the money.

  I really like the design of the shirt, with the different colors on the side highlighting the shirt and shaping the body. Some are better than others however, out of the pack of 5 at least 2 of them had some defects, specifically on the shoulders, for some reason it seems that the sewing was a bit different on those leading to the material to rise more than normal instead of sitting over the body.

  In many cases t-shirts are t-shirts, but I was surprised that I noticeably liked these. I'm fit but on the slim side, so many shirts are too big. These fit just right, look good and feel good. If you have a larger frame/big biceps I would probably say go up a size.

  I bought the 5 pack. Disappointed to start off.So the first thing I noticed is that for a men’s “large” the shirt was a bit snug. The fabric is extremely NOT stretchy so it feels restrictive. At the absolute least if you REALLY want these shirts I would recommend buying the next size up.Next I noticed  that the left sleeve was REALLY tight. Like almost cutting off circulation. The right side didn’t have much room either.So I thought maybe my left arm was slightly bigger?Nope. The next shirt I tried the RIGHT arm was too tight, left was okay. It was like the shirt was made to quickly and it’s too tight in certain spots around the shoulder and chest.These shirts seem really cheaply made and I am going to have to return them.

  On the advice of my Dermatologist, I was looking for some UPF/SPF Protection undershirts to use with golf shirts that don't offer the UV protection already.  I was pleased by the variety of colors and protection advertised on-line.  They arrived and look great, unfortunately there is no documentation or tag with the shirt that says they offer UV protection.  That seems a bit odd to me.  I gave them a 5 Star rating anyway.  They do look and fit nicely.  I may adjust after I wear the a few times and see how they hold up.  After a few washing you might find them a bit shrunk; I would suggest getting one size larger.  It worked out better for me on my seconf batch.

  These shirts are very cheap. Uncut stitching threads several inches long on every shirt at almost every seam. The material is as thin as it xN be without being transparent, and is very delicate. Not suitable for athletic use, these will be trashed after just a few uses. One of the shirts in the pack already had a hole ripped in the chest when I received them, and it was thrown into the trash.It's a shame the quality is so poor, because these are attractive shirts otherwise.

  Unfortunately these shirts suck for multiple reasons. The colors are awesome, price is great, but I wouldn't buy these again.1) The collar is HUGE. Everytime you wear these shirts you'll be reminded that you can fit both of your fists between your collar and neck. Pretty disappointing, seriously its that huge. Whenever I put one on I fear I look like a slob.2) Several issues with stitching brand new. I've noticed several of the shirts stitch lines are not even, are wavy, are just look terrible.3) Printed logo inside the back of the collar is printed horribly. Not that anyone sees this but really shows the quality control on these. One logo would be printed straight, another crooked at a 30 degree angle, and another missing parts of the print.

  I purchased these shirts to stay cool while at work. I'm in construction and they do keep me cool. If I sweat the shirts don't stay wet and uncomfortable. They dry off almost instantly and remain comfortable. My only complaint is that the neck size is a lite too tight. I'm a 20"" neck and I have a big chest so I got the XXL size. I think I'll try the XXXL if it's available. Definitely recommend these shirts, especially for the price.

Im not wasting money and time to do all of that. Really wish all these shirts fit right tho because they feel good and look good but you guys have to make sure are good before they go.

  I'll be honest, I woke up and found that after 10 months of quarantine, a number of my go-to lounging/light work shirts were a little more snug than I'd prefer.I needed to build up a nice stock of lightweight workout shirts, but didn't want to spend $25 per shirt and took a gamble on these.First off, yes, the material is pretty thin. You can pull it over your head and still see through pretty well.  It is also pretty soft, has a nice, flattering design, and has similar stretch/feel to some other lightweight moisture-wicking shirts. So it's a bit of a tradeoff, but if you get over the psychological hurdle of ""shirt thin, shirt cheap"" then you'll probably enjoy this set. Who needs a heavier workout shirt when you're cleaning the car or jogging, anyway.These are definitely the kind of shirts you beat up by tossing them in a gym bag or wearing them when washing a car. But that's kind of what I was looking for anyway!

  Alright, so I bought these thinking “the bad reviews couldn’t be THAT correct.” ...I was wrong. I understand that you’re essentially paying $6/shirt, but these are some poorly made shirts. I’m 6’7, 205lbs and bought the XL to be safe (which was the right choice) because of some reviews. Each color fit incredibly different...and awkwardly. Some were way too small, bordering on a medium, and some were HUGE. They are all very shiny, so if you’re into that “golf shirt” sheen, you’ll like these. One of the shirts came with a stain on it, so that was pretty cool. That being said, I wore them while in Bangkok, and they did a decent job keeping me cool. I sent them all to the second-hand store as soon as I got home. Save your money, buy something else.

  Very cute in the cut is very flattering however just simply washing them on the gentle cycle causes the colors to fade.

I do have to say they are like I said cute and very comfortable. Perhaps The softness of the fabric is somehow causing the colors to fade faster.

  Bought this for both general wear and workouts.  Gotta say, it feels amazing.  Very lightweight and breathable.  It almost feels as if I'm not wearing anything or thin silk, fabric is on point.For the size, I'm a medium to large and after reading reviews I went for the large and it fits to about a medium, so a size larger should do it for most folks.  The wear and tear is yet to be seen and even though I feel like these will only last about 6-9 months its well worth the buy - will absolutely be buying more.

  The size and cut of these shirts are all over the place.  Each one fit differently even though they were all marked as large.  Out of the five shirts one was pretty good and one was good.  The other three I threw away.  One was a medium even though it said large.  One had a stretched out neck and an odd sleeve cut.  The other was somewhere between a medium and a large which made it too small for me.  There wasn't a single shirt that was the same size as another shirt.

  If you like a cling fit, very stretchy very lightweight then this shirt my be for you. It is not what I was looking for except being inexpensive. The neck fit is good. By the time you gt to the chest, I would say you will need at least 2 sizes larger than you regularly wear. This is called a ""Men’s Dry-Fit Moisture Wicking Active Athletic Performance Crew T-Shirt"" and that is what it is. It seems to actually fit the description but I was looking for a casual loose-fitting garment. Just remember to buy 2 sizes big if you want a normal fit. The stretch to the fabric is relaxed and the shirt is not too tight but it is form fitting.

  The shirts are a bit tight around the neck, and the fabric is not uniformly connected at the seams (some parts are looser than others, if that makes sense). One of the shirts has extra fabric on the shoulder so it looks like I'm wearing shoulder pads.They actually feel like you are wearing them slightly backwards the entire time. But if you flip them around, then they really pull at your neck. All around, not a comfortable or uniform fit.

  My husband has been trimming up and now wears an XL.  I ordered him the XXL to give him the little extra room he likes when exercising.  Well, the XXL was too tight in the chest,  and the collar and arm holes were also a bit small.  Turns out it fits me perfectly and I normally wear a women's xxl.  It even tapers at the waist the way women's shirts do.  The collar and arms also fit me perfectly.  The fabric is soft, lightweight, and has a decent stretch. I now have some nice shirts and he's looking for ones that actually fit a man's body.  I would suggest ordering up a size or two.  If you are lean/lanky these shirts will fit well.  But if you have any bulk at all, expect it to hug and fit tightly in those areas.

  I bought these shirts knowing they would not be the highest quality, but just wanted them to wear around the house .  At first look, they looked decent. Not bad material, they fit pretty well, some of them already had some loose threads, but overall I was pretty happy for the price.  Unfortunately, they had a horrible smell that I hoped would go away after washing them.  I've washed them 4 times so far and the smell still won't go away.  I've never had this issue with any clothing before. It's so strong, I can't even wear them.  They want me to pay $5 to return them, which isn't worth it, so I'll try to wash them a few more times to see if it goes away.  Looks like I'll end up throwing them away.

  The shirts are very nice.  I received the shirt took them out of the package and they have a bad smell so I took them washed and dried and they still had the smell.  I let them hang in the closet for a couple of day and the smell remained. I washed and dried them again hung them in the closet again and to this day they still have the smell. It doesn't want to leave so I guess I'm going to pack them up and return them.

  After gaining my normal holiday weight, I needed some temporary shirts to get me through my weight loss.  I do this every year.  They fit my needs.  However, the material is very thin and fragile.  One tug on the collar and you will hear the crisp sound of threads breaking.  Not fashionable, but I am old and don't give a rat.  If you want better quality, I would suggest spending at least a twenty note for each shirt.  This was a bargain for me and again....temporary.  I'm cool.

  The weather has been near freezing this week, but the shirts have kept me dry from sweat on my morning hikes.  Staying dry and staying warm at 32 degrees is important as we near winter(December as of this review).  The shirts have the same characteristics of my Nike or Under Armor shirts at about a third the price.  Can't comment on hot weather.

  Shirts sewing was pretty bad, I had to take all five to a seamstress to get the stitching fixed on all of them. Shirt inner text started peeling on 3 of the five shirts after the first wash before I even wore them. These shirts do not breath at all so sweat drips out of the shirt instead of evaporate through. I've had to start using them at 4am when the temperature is about 45 F so they trap all the heat in. Never buying anything from the essentials brand again. The only reason I didn't return them is because I would have had to pay for the return shipping.

I am also usually a large in workout shirts (6ft tall 195lbs) and the larges were tight on me around the chest; not an issue if you like tighter shirts but I was not expecting them to be this tight.On the plus side the fabric itself is comfortable when working out, running and lifting weights, and is pretty good at sweat wicking.

  It might have been my mistake, but I didn't gather from the description of these shirts that they would fit as snug as they do. Normally I wear a medium in standard wicking workout shirts, but these are more of an in-between standard fit and compression fit. They are snug. I had to send the mediums back and get large. Medium looked a little scandalous on me :-)Other than that the shirts are value-priced and produced. The material and construction are about what you should expect from something priced as low as these. I'm just gonna abuse them in the gym anyway, so I'll buy more when these are no longer useful.

  Slightly larger than expected in all dimensions but a nice product. I ordered a medium and I would call this medium-large if  such a thing existed.  Had there been an XS option than I would have ordered the medium with more confidence but they only have small which probably would have been better. Quality is excellent.

  First I'll say the cons: the XL shirts I received run a bit tight on me (44' chest). I also received a different set of colors than what I choose (didn't want a green shirt but working out isn't a fashion show for me so no big deal). These are the reasons why I didn't 5 star this product.However, having said all of this, I've worked out with these shirts and they are quite comfortable. I'm glad I purchased them.

  Have been very skeptical on all purchases lately especially when it comes to close.  These shirts though really boosted my online shopping morale.  Very happy with the texture, length and color.  They are slightly long which is actually kind of nice.  Much rather have long than too short and constantly pulling down.  These are great shirts to wear around the house doing projects and working out.  And they are nice enough to wear out and about if the Covid stay-at-home orders ever go away.  Only had these shirts for 1 week so can't see much on wear and tear yet.

  I read a lot of reviews, and chose to take a chance. I really liked the look of these shirts. As many others have said, the colors are much different in person. It's because they used the flash to take their product pictures. I used the flash on my phone and it makes the colors pop. However, they are definitely the darker shade. They definitely run small, as well. I comfortably wear a men's size large tshirt, normally. I got the XL, and as others said, they are more like a medium. Two of them do fit slightly smaller. Also, 4 out of the 5 have a subtle v-neck collar, rather than crew neck. Overall, pretty regretful of my decision on this purchase. I like the feel and style of the shirts, and I can deal with them being smaller than marked. The inconsistencies make it hard to really be very happy. I'm keeping them, mainly due to laziness towards the return process.

  This purchase was a super bargain and I'm extremely satisfied with this transaction. The item I received (pack of 5 athletic shirts) was the correct size and colors I ordered. This may seem insignificant, but I can't tell you how many times in the past I did not receive the actual item I ordered in other similar transactions from other sellers. For that reason, I wanted to go on record to let you know that what you see in the pictures is what I received. The quality in terms of look and feel, and the material/stitching are substandard when compared to recognized name brands like Nike, Under Armour, etc., however that was something to be expected, considering how ridiculously affordable the 5-pack is ($27.99) relative to the better known alternatives. I wore two different shirts to the gym last week and was very satisfied each time with the performance from a breathability standpoint, the freedom of movement that was relatively unrestricted but still provided some support, and the overall aesthetic. The sizing for me is on point. I ordered size small and they fit snug enough so that you can see the shape and contour of my body without being too tight and creepy. Be sure you do not expect the same quality material and feel from Nike or Adidas brand, otherwise you will be disappointed. I like the fact that these shirts I purchased are easy to mix and match with my regular gym wear because the colors are a conservative standard set which are unobtrusive and without any tags or conspicuous branding. I will basically wear them to the gym, as an athletic top when I go running, and occassionaly as a casual top (while they are still new) with jeans and sneakers.

I will be ordering more.

  At $6 per shirt you aren't expecting much. I ended up throwing the grey one away immediately since half of the stitching on the bottom hem was broken and the collar/shoulder seam was misaligned causing the shirt to twist. The shoulders fit tight and vaguely uncomfortably. Overall the fabric is fine and I wasn't looking for anything more than something lightweight for the midsummer heat.They were alright.

  If you wear a t shirt under shirt ;switch to these. I wear polo shirts at work but go from hot outside to AC cold inside  so sweat can be an issue. I switched from cotton tees to the dry moisture WIC tees. The difference is incredible. The fit is so comfortable, when it's hot outside and I'm sweating I'm cool but don't feel soggy like I did with the cotton tees. When I go back inside I feel comfortable not sticky from dried sweat.

  These shirts were alright. I would recommend going a size up from usual. I had to go up to a 2XL and they were still a little tight for me. But thats is just my personal prefetence. I did however believe I received a used shirt since the tagless imprint was washed out. I did have to throw the white shirt away since after throwing it in the washer it started to unravel the stitching. So I am down to four shirts. It's fine though I guess. I wasn't expecting them to last too much. Overall, the feel is nice. The length is below my waist. And they're comfortable sleeping shirts as well.

The main, serious problem, however, is the chemical, petroleum-like odor.  They are unwearable; I am concerned about the health impact of the shirt touching my skin for an extended time.

  A good athletic shirt for the price.  Comfortable and light weight material but not too thin.  There was a small amount of bunching at the bottom of the seam of the front and back panels on a couple of the shirts.  Nothing too major.  The stitching is ok. A little uneven around the collar and sleeves.  Again, nothing major.  The quality meets expectations for the price.  Used for daily 5 mi. run and work outs.  Decent athletic shirt for the price.

  I ALWAYS, and I do mean ALWAYS buy based upon reviews. I did read all the negative reviews about these shirts but because I needed them at an affordable price, I ordered them anyway, HUGE mistake. These shirt are AWFUL. I didn't find them to be significantly different in size from each other as some of the reviews said (but honestly, I didn't hold them all up to each other either) but I have a long list of complaints on these shirts without adding that to the list. 1.) They are WAY, WAY smaller than they should be. I ordered my usual size and no joke, no exaggeration, they are at least 2 full sizes too small.2. All of my other dry fit shirts are cool and comfortable. These, however, are the hottest most uncomfortable shirts I have ever had the misfortune of trying on AND I even tried them on, inside, in a comfortable environment rather than somewhere hot (like my place of employment where I had intended to wear these things).3. I have read a lot of reviews on other products that mention a chemical smell but I haven't actually experienced this myself, ever, even on those items until now. These shirts have the strongest, horrible chemical smell! I can't imagine even washing them would take away from that awful odor & I tried them on (without first washing them so I could return them if needed) and now I have a rash that I am afraid to even imagine what it could be from.So, listen to the reviews. DO NOT buy these shirts. Trust me on this, it isn't going to save you any money. They stink, they are hot and uncomfortable AND unless you order a minimum of 2 sizes up, they aren't even going to fit. Save yourself time, energy and effort and just pay more and get another brand and pay a little more.  I only gave one star because it won't permit me to give less than one star.

  Tried it on and immediately noticed that the hole for the head is on the small side without any real give. Likewise, the chest and arms are tight. I ordered a set of larges and figured i should be fine as i run just slightly too big for most mediums. Not the case. The fabric has absplutelt no stretch or give to it either, which is odd for a dri-fit shirt. I get the impression these wouldn't be a good fit for lifting or calisthenics, but they're not going to get that far. They're going back to the retailer. Also each shirt varies drastically with size.

  My honest review is: I bought large according to my waist specification that was outlined but upon trying them on- they were way to small, needing a x or xx-large perhaps. The stitch quality was beneath expected and I don't understand why out of 5 value shirt deal does it comes with two of the same color? I can deal with the price barely because of the 5 value for one price and the silk style material but I was disappointed overall. If you have waist line as I do and not trimmed then the exact size will not work but will fit too tight. I'm in the process of returning. I may exchange for an xx size,

  Of the 5 pack, only 1 shirt did not have issues. The other 4 always felt like they sat wrong. Always felt like I was wearing them backwards somehow. The neck felt like it was riding up, and the shoulders felt tight when moving the arms forward.I bought a pack of large, and 1 of them was XXL instead.I would not recommend.

  I ordered these shirts with very low expectations, just needing a few shirts to workout in. I order the five pack of short sleeves. The only thing they got right is assorted colors. I got five different colors. The first one I tried on was a silver-grey color, and along with having the bacon neck fresh out of the package, it also had some dirt marks on the left sleeve...cool right. This led me to further inspect the rest of the shirts. Two of the shirts in my pack are sleeveless...??? Odd. And one is an xl. Out of the four larges, none are actually the same size. They’re itchy. They’re awful. I won’t even wear these. They’re going in the trash or to folks who don’t care. Even my low expectations were not met, please don’t buy these as this company obviously just doesn’t care. Look past the “#1 Best Seller” tag from amazon and get something different.

  For starters the colors aren't as bright as what's pictured.  I also found these ran on the small side.  When I order an extra large, I expect them to fit a little loose.  These are tight fitting on me, a pudgy guy...Ok...Alright.  A fat guy.  But I'm workin' on it!  That's why I bought these workout shirts!  Initially these things smelled pretty bad.  Just a bad new shirt smell, but after washing them a few times that smell has gone away.  It definitely took more than one wash though.  I'm cheap, so for $6 each they aren't bad.  Don't expect Under Armour quality.

  Five shirts in the package.  They said they were all 'LARGE'.  One of five shirts fit nicely.  One I couldn't get my head through, and ended up cutting the lining in front so I could get the shirt on.  Once I got that shirt on, it fit in the body and is very comfortable.  One was obviously the next size smaller, and is a throwaway too small (even though it reads the correct size).  The other two shirts ran small - I can get them on, but they are uncomfortable.  Materials are good, and the two shirts that fit I really like, even though I had to cut the one.  I expected them ALL to be the same.  Quality control people, do some quality control.

I GAVE THEM ONE STAR BECASUE THERE ISN'T AN OPTION FOR ZERO STARS.  DO NOT BUY!!!

  Very soft, fits a little loose so definitely not a tight fit. I bought these for my boyfriends birthday- he’s 5’10” and 180lbs, I got him a medium- they are a little loose on his torso but fit his arms, chest and shoulders perfectly. At 6$ each you can’t go wrong- will probably get him other colors later on

  These shirts are like lootboxes these days. You hope you get something good, but get more trash before finding that one good item. The 5 pack came in, all correct sizes. However the neck hole sizes vary, the shirts run a tad shorter than I'd like, and the stitching is...horrible.

  Very thin (which is a plus for me), no stitching issues on the 10 I bought. I'm using them for sublimation and they work and hold color well even after washing (which may be due to the ink quality), and they have a nice shine to them. The only down side (doesn't really bother me) is that 1/5 shirts has the lines going diagnally instead of horizontally. Looks fine but makes lining prints up on the heat press a whole new game lol. Good product for the money though.

  You definitely get what you pay for with these. I wanted to like these very badly because of the material and how comfortable they are. I bought 2 packs, the solid colors and the other various non-solid color ones. First impression was WOW these feel great. Then I tried on another and was like, hmmm this one has a tight collar and I find myself trying to pull it down. Some of the arm holes were even different sizes. Some collars were ""bacony"" already and I could tell that after a few washes this would become very problematic, especially if you are constantly pulling down to relieve a tight collar. I had to be careful when taking off or putting on hangers and while taking the shirts off because it felt like I would stretch the collar permanently or rip a seam when taking it off. One of the shirts was DRASTICALLY too small. I bought a size large and it fit like a medium. Overall, 1/10th of them were too small. Around 4/10 of them felt like they had too tight a collar. The shoulder stitches are off and don't fit snug around the shoulders. All of them had shoulder seams that stuck up and bothered me (and I have built shoulders/traps). One of them even had what appeared to be dirt on them.Final decision was made after trying on all shirts multiple times and determining that after a few washes these would be useless. For 6 bucks each I did not feel that they would even be worth the few wears you would get before having to toss them. Made in Egypt. Save your time and money and try something else.

  Extremely disappointed in this product. I bought these thinking they would be a good summer work shirt for my job (Construction). I've had dry-fit shirts before and they have worked great in the past so when I saw this product with the ""#1 best seller"" tag on amazon, I decided to purchase.When first opening the package I experienced a chemically smell. Looking passed that, chaulking it up as a ""new shirt smell"", I tried one of the shirts on. I originally purchased an XL because I like a more loose fit, but these are very tight. Not much stretch in the fabric. The neck is extremely tight and uncomfortable. The fabric is somewhat itchy and seems to cause you to sweat more just by putting it on. Checking the fabric by pulling the shirt down I discovered the front half of the shirt seems to be a different fabric than the back half seeing that the front half is more stretchy than the back half...Taking the shirt off led me to inspect the stitching on the inside of the shirt. Lots of extra thread and misstitches. Not to mention how tight the neck is, I could barely get my head and beard through.All and all, i would not recommend these shirts to anyone, especially someone that is relatively fit and bearded. Will most likely end up giving these to the girlfriend to sleep in.

  Purchased XL, in case these shirts run small, I normally fit in Large, but could barely fit my head into this shirt. Picture included comparing a normal Large shirt with this Men’s XL undershirt. Shoulders are about 5” smaller than my Large shirt.

  At first we were sent wrong size in one of the five shirts but I thought not too big of a deal was just a little big. But then only after a week wearing the shirts they are now tearing apart at the inseams. Armpit and sides on all shirts are tearing apart. This is not good quality at all. Never had this happen before and have purchased long sleeves in this material for my husband here at Amazon but not this brand or company here. Not worth the $30 we paid. I can’t send back used items that are falling apart due to poor workmanship and quality. and it will only let me put in defected item but then I have to return it says. That’s rediculous, can’t they see with the fotos the poor quality for just a week after being worn. I’m not wasting time on sending these back. Why would they want worn shirts back that were clearly made with poor quality and defects. This is my first complaint ever with amazon and I have purchased many items over the years. So you know it is bad.

  Wow! I’m impressed from the start. This product is perfect fit, not to thin not to thick but stylish in various colors you can mix and match... I would recommend to anyone that’s lookin for a decent cheap athletic shirt is a 5-Pack at $30 isn’t bad! I wear it during martial arts training, basketball, BLX Bike rides, just wearing about the house yard work etc... I love this product a lot.This runs a lil big, glad I ordered a small size normally I like to where a medium but this brand fits like a medium but I order small. I’m 5-10 170lbs. Shirt length is 5 inches below the belt line and above your (You Know What)!!! LolI definitely recommend this brand considering only wear during indoors and summer time not a bad investment for $30!High Recommended!!!

  Great shirts! I took a picture with all five shirts are stacked on top of each other and they are all the same size. I ordered size medium. I did that because there seem to be a lot of reviews about mismatched sizes. The colors are good. They feel really nice. Bought five different sets. Happy with all my purchases
