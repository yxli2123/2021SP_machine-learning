  Great budget Full HD monitor with DisplayPort, HDMI and VGA ports. Can rotate (clockwise) to portrait mode, height adjustable and can tilt. Loved that it doesn’t have a power brick. 110-220 volt.04-Oct-2020 Update:  Bought another one and just installed today to an older PC that have DVI (via DVI-HDMI adapter) and used the audio cable provided (PC audio out to monitor audio in). By default, the analog audio is not enabled so you have to go into the monitor's menu, navigate to Management->Audio and check the box next to the Analog audio for the speakers to work.

  after six months of working in quarantine on a laptop, I had to break down and buy a monitor. I have an HP EliteBook and this monitor seemed similar to what we use at the office, so I ordered it. I can’t tell you how EASY it was to set up right out of the box. It has built in speakers and the HDMI cord plugs right into my laptop. Now I can use the monitor as my main screen and the laptop as my secondary screen, if needed. But honestly this monitor is so big I don’t even know what to do with all the screen space I have now. At this price, I’m going to gift one to my direct report so she can benefit from having a larger screen.  Do yourself a favor and buy this monitor for your home. You will be so glad you did.

  Monitor speaker made wierd noise when i hooked up my Playstation, so I returned it. But thats not why I'm un happy. Im in happy for the seller putting false information on their website. On the product information on the sellers page it has down 1920x1080 at 75Hz. When it has down on the front page of the set up guide that its 1920x1080 at 60Hz ,not 75 like what is put in the website.  So I would of returned the item regardless if it made noise with my Ps3 or not because I want a monitor with at least 75hz and this one is only at 60Hz. Looked up monitors specs on a diffrent website than Amazon and they have refresh rate down as 60Hz for this monitor. Not cool.

  Bought this monitor for my son. He docks it with his laptop, and has also connected his Switch and Mini NES to it via HDMI. The picture is great, and the sound is surprisingly good for a monitor. The monitor easily adjusts vertically, and the tilt also works well so you can get it into the ideal position. The controls are easy to use and you can tell it is well built, it is not flimsy like other monitors in this price range. Definitely recommend it.

  If it also passes the test of time (received it and flawlessly installed it minutes ago), then this product might very well qualify for one of the best ever in its category. Unbeatable deal, considering the $110 I've paid for it. Received the monitor impeccably packed and in perfect condition from across the entire country in less than 48 hours since I've ordered it using just my regular Prime membership. The product has been shipped with the Amazon's own shipping service. So, my hat down, HP and Amazon, thank you very much!

    Great monitor + 75Hz + HOW TO FIX LOW VOLUME SOUND
  
",5.0,LindguiniTop Contributor: Watches,"Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  This HP 24mh monitor has a clear, crisp display and is the perfect size for desktop use (not too big, not too small).  It accepts both HDMI and DisplayPort inputs (and even VGA for old school PCs).  While Windows will select 60Hz refresh rate by default, you can go into Windows' display settings and select 75Hz refresh rate for this monitor.  The 75Hz refresh rate really does help smooth out motion.  You should also go into the monitor's ""Image"" menu setting and set Response Time to Level 3 which provides the best VSYNC performance.  One of the best features that places this monitor above and beyond its price range is the 90-degree rotating screen, height adjustment, and swiveling base.  The stand is rock-solid without any wobble.  The speakers are just fine once you discover the menu control I explain below:HOW TO FIX LOW VOLUME SOUND:  The built-in speakers are better than some reviewers indicate.  I believe most people don't discover that the monitor menu has its own volume control that's set to 50% volume by factory default.  If you just connect this monitor to the PC you'll automatically get sound through the HP speakers via HDMI or DisplayPort (you only have to use the separate audio cable when using the VGA input).  But no matter how high you turn up your PC volume control, you'll only get 50% volume from the monitor's speakers which is why people complain about low volume.  To fix this, all you need to do is go to the ""Management"" tab of the monitor menu, select ""Audio"", and then turn up the volume control from 50 (default) to 100 and you'll find the monitor speakers are plenty loud.  After that, you'll only have to use your PC volume control as normal.This is a great quality monitor with features beyond its price range.  Fantastic value, HP!ADDITIONAL NOTE:  HP sells an identical monitor to the HP 24mh under the model P24h.  The only difference is that the P24h has a black plastic logo strip along the bottom instead of silver like the 24mh.  Everything else is identical (specs, speakers, height adjustable stand, etc.) plus the P24h comes with both an HDMI cable and a DisplayPort cable.

  Great value for your money. Bought two for my office. The monitor goes up, down, tilts backward & forward. You actually can turn the screen to a vertical position which also makes it super easy to plug into your hdmi or display port.Also, someone wrote there are no speakers which I found that review to be confusing. My monitors have internal speakers and they work just fine. - Kurtis Pool

  Gee, what is up with some of the reviewers stating this monitor has no speakers, and can't do 75hz!My monitor has speakers, and when I adjusted the sound in the menu on monitor to 100 percent Volume, sounded good to me!  (out of box it's only set to 50 percent and not that loud).The 75hz option is if your other equipment has 75hz setting. My PC has 75hz setting, my xbox doesn't.This monitor had a 95 percent 5 star rating in the beginning!  Now it's dropping like a rock because people read the most popular review and the most critical review that both are spreading lies!You can see how FAKE NEWS can spread and many people believe the FAKE NEWS and repeat it in new reviews!

  Bought this for the online schooler at home to replace looking down on his laptop. Specifically went with this model because of its adjustability. The design is sleek with pretty much no edge on the outside. Integrated sounds is another nice feature, so we don't have to get a speaker system cluttering the table. Overall it's a good value for the price.

  Overall the price was right and the screen is great. A few people complain about the speakers being too quiet. The built in speakers are pretty good, just don't expect the quality of the speakers to be as good as $100 external speakers. To adjust Speaker Volume on the monitor itself with HDMI connected (this should work with the 3.5 mm male to male cable as well):• Press any of the buttons on the monitor (not the power)• Select the far left menu icon• Press the second from the left button to scroll down to management• Press the far left button to select• Scroll to audio• Press far left button to select• Select volume• Adjust the max range up to 100%. The default is set on 50%Then use the volume control slider on your PC to adjust the volume as you normally would.

",5.0,Lampshade,"Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  I selected this monitor because it has both HDMI and DisplayPort inputs, (it also has VGA, but I'll never use it) has a stand that will rotate to 90, allows for VESA mounting without blocking inputs, is 24"" diag. with small bezels, is 1920x1080, and is an established brand. It is all of these, no problem. What you also get is tool-free installation (nice to have even if you have plenty of tools), and cables! I expect a power cord with anything that uses power, but I did not expect an HDMI cable. It did not come with a DisplayPort cable, but I hooked one (of the two I bought) via miniDP, and a full-sized cable would have just gone into the parts pile.  Six-foot HDMI cables are a great item to have laying around.It also came with an 1/8"" stereo patch cable for analog audio. I saw the description about speakers, but didn't intend to use that feature. I didn't even hook up the cable. What surprised me was when the monitor I hooked up via HDMI started playing sound from the laptop. This feature does not seem to be mentioned anywhere in this product description, nor even in the user manual, but this thing does HDMI audio extraction! I haven't yet tried, but I think you could hook up a Chromecast and get the full audio/video experience. That said, there does not seem to be much of an amplifier -- it's not loud, even with the volume cranked all the way up on the PC (there is no on-monitor volume control). In any case, it's a nice bonus. I didn't buy this thing for the speakers, but their presence doesn't bother me. The display portion of the monitor is fairly thin. The speakers do add a bit of girth, but no more than you would have from a similarly-featured (no audio) 24"" monitor from a few years ago. Same goes for weight. I generally use Dell 24"" monitors, and this HP model holds up well against the Dell models that are significantly more expensive (and have not dropped features like VESA mounting and 90 rotating base support).Bottom line: I'm thrilled to get a high quality 24"" 1920x1080 monitor with VESA mounting, 90 rotating base, and both HDMI and DisplayPort, and even giddy about the included HDMI cable and speakers, all for $110.

  There is no setting to fix a cheap monitor, I tried thinking that as technology improves cheap monitors should get better.; wrong it doesn't get any better.There is no Clear Type adjustment, driver, or resolution /Hz that could fix what it is unfixable.The idea was to use it as a second extendable monitor in portrait mode and be able to see and edit complete documents or spreadsheets.Look and compare both attached pictures, the clear crispy one is on the primary Dell monitor the other picture is the same image moved to the secondary HP monitor.

  First of all, It was delivered within two days for normal membership. Its a new product and there isn’t much review anywhere. But I was tempted to buy for 2 reasons. One for hight adjustment and second it can tilt vertically. My main purpose is for home office so I dont mind the refresh rate but it does come with 75 hz. The speakers are decent enough. It comes with HDMI cable and an audio cable for aux. For little over 100 bucks, this is excellent monitor.

",4.0,halowe,"Reviewed in the United States October 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  Set up originally using an HDMI cable and it worked flawlessly! Of course, one of the reasons I chose this monitor is because of the built-in speakers. Unfortunately, the speakers do NOT work with the HDMI cord plugged in. Originally, I thought the speakers just simply didn’t work.I contacted tech support and they had me try a different cord but never asked me about HDMI. So, although she was very nice, she had no idea what she was doing aside from reading a script. They need to add the HDMI issue their script. A note on the site itself might be a good idea as well. Anyway, she set up a return that I later cancelled (they never told UPS that I cancelled so he showed up for a return the next - actually, that was wrong as well since I couldn’t return it till the new one arrived - oh well...)Anyway, after I sat and thought about it for a while, I suspected that the HDMI carrying the audio signal thereby blocking it. So, I used the VGA connection. It works, but I had to significantly adjust the vertical setting on the monitor.Bottom line, the monitor is now fully functional including the speakers. The speakers sound pretty much like any other PC speakers although a tad louder, certainly loud enough for my use. I was able to tweak the sound a bit with the audio manager that came with the Lenovo computer. The point I deducted was for the tech support. I realize this is a new monitor but the people answering the phone should at least understand the technology even if they don’t know the item details.UPDATE 1: The monitor does NOT work well unless I use an HDMI cable, which I am now doing. So, I am back to external speakers. Basically, if I try to use anything other than an HDMI cable, the monitor cuts out (goes dark) frequently, although it does come back on again. BOTTOM LINE: I am not able to use the internal soeakers, perhaps you’ll have better luck...

    A BAD experience
  
",1.0,Alexanderdr,"Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased this monitor because of the reviews and my 25+ years of experience with HP products. It arrived quickly and undamaged. And for 2-1/2 months it was a good purchase.A few days ago I started noticing that when I switched applications a ""ghost"" would remain on the screen, visible, behind/below the currently running application. (No, my monitor does not stay turned on to a static screen for hours on end.)Today the problem was so bad I contacted Amazon product support. They were as helpful as they could be, including the CS agent holding for 27 minutes for HP Support to answer the phone..........And then the nightmare began.The first person at HP went through a few troubleshooting steps and said he thought the problem may be the graphics card drivers or the card itself. But, because my desktop is a Lenovo he had to transfer me to an HP agent who could help with a non-HP computer.That person did a few trouble shooting steps (after trying to tell me how to hook up my new printer after I explained the monitor issue) and said that the computer was not the problem, it was the monitor and needed to be resolved as an ""in-warranty"" issue and transferred me to the HP warranty department for resolution.This new agent, after telling me I could ""reset"" the monitor by holding the power key for 15 seconds then said that the problem was not a warranty issue and said she was going to transfer me back to the department that had sent me to her. At which point, after almost 90 minutes on the phone with HP and almost 30 before that with Amazon, I lost my feces.So, tomorrow I am going to file a warranty complaint through my credit card company, file a lack of customer service and common sense complaint with HP and start looking for a new monitor - NOT HP!Until this issue I would have given this monitor a 4 or 5 star rating. Not now, it is only a 1 star, a monitor should not start failing in less than 3 months. The customer service experience is a negative 5.

  For the price, this really can't be beat if you want a new monitor in the home office during month 8+ of COVID-19. Other reviews are incorrect: this DOES come with built-in speakers, which sound fine. My only complaint is that this was advertised as having a 75hz refresh rate, but the HDMI cord this comes with is capable of only 1080p@60hz. Maybe it was just my setup/video card/configuration, but the monitor could handle it and the default cord couldn't! I had to get a DisplayPort cord for an additional $10 and now it does 75hz just fine. Whether I can even tell the difference between 60hz and 75hz is between me and my God, but if you're in the market for a nice new monitor, this is a great choice you won't regret.

  Within two hours of receiving this monitor, it turned off. And stayed off.  Then when I could get it to turn on again, the screen turned green.  Amazon was awesome and connected me to an HP rep.  She said they would send me a box and label to return the monitor and send a replacement within 10-12 business days.  That is NOT the case.  I contacted them on September 29 and it is now October 12 and still no return box or label.  I followed up and they told me I should receive it by October 14.Next, I was told that they will not ship the replacement until they receive the replacement monitor.  At this rate, I will not get the replacement until November.  When I asked if I could receive a refund instead, they basically said ""too late.""  With 40+ Zoom meetings between now and then, I will have to buy another monitor to use in the interim.If you get a dud like I did, opt for the refund ASAP.

",3.0,Tiffany-anne,"Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  So far seems like a great monitor for the price.However, if you think it will come with a DisplayPort cable, *it doesn't*. I had to order the cables and I'm still waiting for them to arrive before I can be able to check the actual performance of the monitors themselves. It does come with a HDMI cable, however.I wish it was a little more clear on the product description, but I guess that could be considered my fault too for not clarifying. Also, as the other reviews have stated, this is *NOT* 75HZ. It's 60HZ! Incorrect description! Since I am using these two as my third & fourth monitors, it isn't that huge of a deal, but for those of you who are looking for 75hz, this is not it.EDIT: if you're looking for clear quality, put in just the little extra bucks to get a better monitor. The text is incredibly blurry, the colors are dull, and in general it's just a subpar monitor when you can get better quality monitors for just a couple bucks more.

",5.0,Jessica M.,"Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought two of these, and they have been great.  I like the input options, and that the monitors have speakers.  I'm no audiophile, so having simple speakers included in the monitors meant I could have one less item on my desk.I put these on the ""Mount it!"" dual VESA mount (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08BW739D2/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o05_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), which was super easy.  The monitors came with a very nice, sturdy, flat-base (So you don't totally lose that desk space!!) stand, but I opted for the mount.  The monitors also came with VESA screws already installed, so mounting them just required removal of the screws and reinstallation of the screws with the VESA mount plate.Also, I have been working from home, and had one these hooked up to both my personal computer and my work computer.  Switching inputs was easy using the hard-key buttons hidden on the bottom-right of the monitor body.And as simple as it is, these came with an HDMI an power cable which were 6ft long each, which was nice.  NOTE: The listing says 75hz refresh rate, but that is with DisplayPort cables.  As I write this, these are running at 60hz on the included HDMI cables.  This doesn't matter at all to me, because I don't play games on them, but FYI!I shop around pretty extensively before making purchases, and I feel confident that these are a good value (obviously, since I bought them).  $110 for a brand-name, 1080p, 60/75hz IPS monitor with speakers, VESA mount-reay but comes with a good stand, and has good input options (HDMI, DP, or VGA).  Now that I've owned them for a few weeks, I would absolutely purchase them again next time.

  I was excited to get two HP 24mh monitors for my home office. The size and resolution were a good match for my Surface Book. The thin margin on 3 sides makes working across multiple monitors much easier. Unfortunately, neither monitor worked correctly out of the box. One constantly turned itself on and off and the sound wouldn't work on either of them (second monitor started the on/off thing after the third day). HP support was not a good experience. They blamed the PC and Microsoft blamed the monitor. I had to spend several hours with my own IT company trouble-shooting to verify that the problem was with the monitors. HP's virtual assistant does not seem to understand that HP sells monitors apart from computers. HP's technical assistance chat person quickly told me that I had to call a different technical support line for this problem and that there would be a nominal fee for the service. (What!?). I called anyway but got bored waiting and explored Amazon's support (Tokyo rocks!) Return and refund were processed right away and I ordered Dell monitors instead.

  EDIT: it appears this monitor has speakers only compatible with Windows. So semi-correct... can’t for the life of me get it to run through my Mac though...Bought this monitor, as many people probably have, because working from home on my 13"" laptop long-term was intolerable. This is a gorgeous monitor, lovely and slimline with an unobtrusive base. It takes a decent amount of real-estate on my desk, but the base is low-profile so I end up setting things on it out of the way. It has a good amount of customizable color balance options. The only drawback I have found is the cables must be run either side of the support which presents a cable management dilemma. Not insurmountable though! For $100 give or take, it's a great monitor, but does not actually have speakers built-in as described, so if that's a deal-breaker for you, heads up.That said, the height and tilt adjustments are nice and solid but not too tough to move around smoothly. As long as the speaker thing doesn't both you, I'd definitely recommend this monitor for a cheap and cheerful posture-saver for WFH!

  Bought this monitor to go side by side with my Samsung 27"" (which I've had for over 7 years). Color was beautiful, read review on how to change from default 60 hz refresh rate to 75 hz and all was well until I reached up to tilt it from the top: BEWARE there is almost NO bevel at the top and edges and touching the screen it broke (sent lines across top and down the center). I had only had it for 26 days. Called Amazon and they said to call HP since it was within the 30 days. HP rep said broken screen was not covered and offered to send me a replacement for the exact price as on Amazon (new) and take 8-10 days to get it to me, PLUS return broken one at my own expense. Thanks, but NO thanks. Called Amazon back on day 30 and told them what HP said and they offered a full refund or replacement with 2-day shipping. They asked me to return the broken one at their cost.  The entire phone conversation took 15 minutes. This is why I am still a Prime customer after almost 20 years. They know how to treat customers.This is a fabulous screen for the price and I could find no others on Amazon in this price range with speakers and 75 hz RR. I did take the replacement, which was here as promised 2 days later and returned the broken one the next day.  Just be careful and only hold the screen on the back and bottom, beveled-edge as the least amount of pressure will crack the screen and that is not covered with Amazon's extra warranty through Assurion nor will HP cover it.

  This full-HD monitor is an outstanding value. The image is great, the frame is unobtrusive and nice looking, the stand is solid and stable, and the built-in speakers are perfectly adequate for Zoom, Teams, Skype, or YouTube videos. It supports VGA, HDMI, and DisplayPort inputs. The power is provided by an AC cord, without the bulky and awkward power transformer box that some monitors come with.Normally I don't care much about the menus built into the monitor, but these deserve special recognition. The user interface (""OSD"" = On Screen Display) is very well organized, full featured, and easy to use. It even has the ability to reposition the menu and to make it translucent.I purchased this monitor to go along with an inexpensive mini-PC and it is an excellent companion.

  I'm probably approaching the purchase of a monitor from a different perspective from many. I wanted a reasonably large monitor but not so large that I couldn't remove it from the table for weekends. Nevertheless, i wanted the ability to rotate the screen to fit a letter on it comfortably. i had also wanted lightweight.The HP  has a brilliant stand, & is v sturdy.  it allows sliding the monitor up & down, at an angle, & yes it does allow full rotation. I read in questions varying answers. The trick to rotation is that one has to slide the monitor as far up from the base as possible, then angle it upwards, at which point it will then  will clear the bottom to allow rotation; otherwise it will not.i wanted a screen that prevents eye fatigue. ASUS advertises this in its headline description. HP has the ability  in its menu to select low blue light, which is the main way to reduce eye fatigue.  The menu system is v easy to use & access.  It also has HP enhance + which I highly recommend in other situations.  The versatility of positioning of the monitor makes for much less stress on eyes too.The screen with stand is not the  lightest at 10 pounds for a 24 inch but  not terrible.  This includes the  magnificent stand which  is v easy to detach unlike many others. Its a simple push to disengage, & pull at the back. This allows for easy storage, in my case over weekends. Keep the packing material to protect the screen. Id say that added at least a few pounds, & was completely worth it.  The monitor also  incorporates the brick many monitors leave with the cable. I don't like all those power cables with bricks, so i welcome the choice. again this adds a pound but avoids clumsiness and unsightly wiring.resolution is reasonable on par with most other basic monitors. the refresh rate apparently can run up to 75hz but i haven't tested this with my Chromebook. the usb-c displayport works perfectly .For the price this is excellent value. a premium build monitor for a basic price.

  I was about to buy vh240a and then Amazon recommended this newer model 24mh. I already have two vh240a, so I know how good it has been. But, this is even better.1. Better speaker quality than vh240a. I felt that this speaker is in an acceptable level now. vh240a speaker was the last option I would pick to hear something out of my PC.2. Extra port - Display port. A good reason I chose this model as my PC ran out of hdmi3. No adapter brick, just the power cable directly to the display. It's 2020 and I believe we don't need to compromise. Check!4. Picture quality - No complaints there. Just as good or slightly better than vh240a5. Not really sure, but this felt pretty light if you exclude the stand. So, looks like it will do well with different stands and mountsGo for it! You will not be disappointed.

",1.0,Inqualls,"Reviewed in the United States November 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was on the fence about buying this monitor but ended up doing so because of the hp brand name. Within two hours of use the screen has LED-backlighting burned into it. This is where the edges of the screen become burnt and discolored from poorly manufactured led lighting. Also, the picture is absurdly dark. I also suspect this to be the faulty LEDs. I went in to check the brightness and contrast setting only to find that both settings were already set near the max by factory default!  It's such a shame that amazon suggested this to me and that hp would put their name on something that's clearly defective. Don't be fooled by the nice trailers and good reviews like I was, just pay the extra $50 and get the monitor you actually want. It really is sad how far the quality standard has fallen. Well, I hope this helps others avoid this monitor like the plague.

  I kinda feel bad for rating this 4 stars but I have to. This is a great product for the price. My only problem is it was not what I needed. I have a 4k Dell XPS laptop and the color on my laptop is phenomenal. This monitor (I bought 2) is only FHD up to 1920 x 1080 resolution. It does not look that good next to UHD 3840 x 2160. Sooo, it depends on what you need and what you are looking for. For the price, it is unbeatable. I'm a developer and designer and I need rich color. If used on a different laptop with a lower video card, I would probably have kept these. Yes, I returned them. Thanks to Amazon for a no hassle return. I ended up buying 2 4k UHD monitors that have yet to arrive. I should see a significant difference.

  Bought this to use as a monitor for my 2017 MacBook Air as the 13"" screen was starting to strain my eyes. For some context, I'm a student and my primary use for the screen is to read read read and take lots of notes. I've read a few reviews about issues with the resolution from a mac to this screen, and the surefire way to make sure none of those issues happen is to buy a thunderbolt to hdmi cable - I bought one from amazon basics a couple years ago and it works seamlessly - edge to edge display and full resolution. It's not a 4k monitor or anything but with how big it is and how far back you sit, it's all the same in terms of crisp, clear picture. I don't use my computer for gaming really so I cannot comment on the graphics/resolution for that purpose - but for your basic office or school work - it's perfect.Not sure what a solution would be for newer mac models that have only the usb-c output. Also, this was bought in Feb 2021 and it seems like the latest model comes with built in speakers, has a tilt feature, and vertical sliding to adjust the height. For this price, I think the value is unbeatable. The only downside is that there seems to be no external volume control, but I have my bluetooth headphones in most of the time anyway so it doesn't matter. It also comes with an aux cord to connect to external speakers, and a regular hdmi cable.If you're hesitating on this product, there's a reason it's the #1 seller on computer monitors on amazon!

Only goes away when set to 800x600 display size which is basically like viewing your iPhone through a magnifying glass. Letters aren’t crisp. When rotated to verticals the display colors bleed so badly it’s laughable.

  I got two of these for my home office and honestly the monitors are great, it was a little difficult to get the one assembled due to a jammed part but that was resolved after putting in a little bit of elbow grease.

  I purchased this monitor to replace an Acer 24"" 1080p monitor that had lasted me over 7 years. I liked it because of the thin bezel and the price was great. The first monitor I received had discolored pixels in various places (see image) that would move depending on what was displayed on the screen. I tried several cables and even another computer, but the dead pixel look never let up. I installed the drivers for the monitor and updated my graphics drivers as well, with no success.After this I got a replacement monitor. The replacement monitor was worse because it showed up in packaging that had clearly been put back together after having been opened and used, and the screen had fingerprints and smudges on it. The second monitor also had the same pixel issues, except that it was also having an issue where the screen turns black every 30 seconds or so. Definitely disappointed and getting a refund.

    Bad set-up/menu software, mediocre picture quality...
  
",2.0,Steve15,"Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2021","









  
  
    
  But, it is cheap and not just in price.  Picture quality on the one we received is just OK if you can look past the light bleed around most of the edges and corners. I could probably live with that because of the price but there are other problems.  The setup/menu software for adjusting the monitor is sparse and some of the features keep changing on their own, for example, the sound setup/menu for the built-in speakers.  Because I am using an HDMI cable for the picture and a line-in cable from an external sound source for the sound the monitor wants to use the HDMI cable as a source for the sound to the speakers so it resets itself every time the computer is shutdown or rebooted.  If I don't go into the menu setup of the monitor each time the drivers are updated or the system is shutdown or rebooted we don't have any sound and we need to change the setup back to using the line-in cable as the source, then it works fine, until the next time (even the computer going into sleep mode causes this problem).Went to HP,s support site only to find one set of drivers and manuals designed to work over a wide array of their monitors and no firmware updates to fix this problem (or anything else for that matter) and they want to blame everything and everybody else as a source for the problem instead of the problematic software that they refuse to acknowledge is the problem.  I guess the old saying ""you get what you pay for"" is the lesson here.

  Got this gem a week ago. Setup was easy. I'm using this one as a second monitor attached to my laptop so I can use 3d modeling software. This monitor also has speakers in the rear, an interesting add-on.Pros: high quality image, clear picture, brightness, and accessible menu controls; screen can be adjusted on tilt and vertical axis (raised/lowered to eye level); excellent cost-to-value product for casual users to do business, browsing, etc. Would function fine for games but doesn't have the high resolution for most recent games based on 4K specs.Cons: some light bleed (about 1.5"" on the right bezel) but not enough to warrant a return; cable ports can be hard to access, especially VGA given the need to screw the port head in (although HDMI is a simple insertion). I get why ports are positioned this way but I would hope in today's modern era they'd make it easier to insert a cable. Some may not like the adjustable height mechanism to raise/lower the display. Display cannot be rotated horizontally. It is fixed straight ahead.Despite these minor complaints, I love this monitor. At at time when monitors are headed to 4K and 8K resolutions, costing hundreds of dollars, the HP 24mh delivers impressive quality at a nice price.

    Moderate Picture Quality, Misleading Audio Options
  
",1.0,Christopher L. Kingery,"Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2021","









  
  
    
  I'm not sure if I got a lemon, or if I'm just the victim of some poor or misleading advertising. The only way I can get audio to the speakers is via HDMI. Except there's no volume controls on the monitor, and most systems (including macs, gaming consoles, etc) don't allow you to adjust volume before outputting, so there's no way to adjust system volume using HDMI for audio.It came with a male-to-male 3.5mm audio cable, the type you'd expect to use to connect speakers to your computer. But in plugging the cable into the monitor and the computer, I don't get any sound. The only way I've found to get sound is to switch the audio output on my computer back from headphones to hdmi. So I don't know if the audio jack is a broken input, or if it's actually an output that allows your audio from the hdmi to go to external speakers. The fact that the audio port is completely unmarked doesn't help, either.As for the display itself, it's OK I guess. The quality isn't as good as the iMac that it replaced, despite the fact that my iMac was over 8 years old. The brightness and colors are passable, but it seems noticeably less sharp, even though this monitor and my old iMac both have a resolution of 1080p.

  When I hooked up this monitor the screen didn’t fill to the edges.  I played with the menu and found overscan enlarges the view past the edges of the screen.  In fact it enlarges it too much so I am using it with a 3/8” black margin all the way around.Yes it has speakers. Yes, I had to go in the menu and inform the monitor I wanted to use the green cable instead of the HDMI for the audio.  The only thing that bothers me is that the audio goes back to the HDMI default every time I power off the computer.I gave everything five stars because my beloved wife is planning to steal this monitor when I am not paying attention so I will probably buy another one.Update:  I was experiencing intermittent blinking of the monitor so I moved it to my wife’s computer and changed the monitor cable.  I now find the screen is filled completely and the blinking has stopped.  I am thinking that the video card in the computer contributes to this monitor’s performance.I remain happy with this purchase.

  Just received this HP 24mh FHD Monitor and set it up today. I saw some reviews that the refresh rate could not be set up to 75 hertz. I have a HDMI port on my Lenovo T480 laptop so I used a HDMI cable, connected it to this monitor, and the refresh rate showed up 75 hertz (see attached photo.)However, if I connect my HDMI cable to my USB C dongle (my dongle has a HDMI connection as well), the refresh rate can only be 60 hertz if connected to a dongle. I have a 2019 MacBook and it doesn't have HDMI connection so I use my USB C dongle to connect this HP monitor to my MacBook. The rate can be 60 hertz (see attached photo.)Therefore, my conclusion would be that you would need to have a direct HDMI connection directly connected your computer with the monitor. If you would use dongles, the refresh rate would be reduced.By the way, the shipping package is very well packed. A HDMI cable and a sound cable are included in the package, so it's very convenient. The Quick Setup Guide is very helpful, very easy to follow to set up the monitor.So far the monitor works great. It can be adjusted up and down and also tilt forward or backward just as it described on the product description on the Amazon website.Well, I just used it for a few hours. So far I’m very satisfied and I think this product is totally worth your money. It actually exceeds my expectation in many ways because the price is $109.

It was easy set up I have it plugged into an older HP laptop, which has all the current windows 10 updates.

I’m streaming Futurama on it through my provider on it as I’m writing this and even my dad dad walked by and even being as nit picky as he is he was impressed. I got it mainly for when school starts up again, and it added more space to my desk and something bigger where I’m not hunched over a laptop staring at a screen and sitting so close as I type (I got a wireless keyboard to go with it) it moves up and down very easily without worry.I gave it four stars for gaming because while I intend to use it for school I do have every intention of playing my PS4 on it, and watching a gamer video on it the quality seems very good. THIS HAS SPEAKERS!!!!!!!! Don’t let other reviews say it doesn’t, it has speakers. I didn’t even have to adjust them when I set it up they just worked immediately. All in all great product that does have speakers, I know some people are SO picky  (it’s understandable) but at $109 for this amount of quality I am definitely happy and won’t pick apart it’s flaws, which I have found none so far!!!

  As someone who just started working from home, it was imperative that I get two good working monitors. I had never really bought myself a monitor before, and studied a lot about the different specs for a monitor, like refresh rate, resolution, panel type, etc. I also needed something affordable that would fit my budget.This was THE BEST find! I love it so much and it has exceeded my expectations, and I only bought them for $109.99 each! I never had an HP computer before, so I am definitely pleased. It was super easy to set up, the screen is like matte and not glossy. You can see everything clearly and it is super wide, just how I like it. You can also turn the monitor’s screen so it is vertical! So helpful when I am looking at excel sheets. You don’t even need to take the screen off of it’s base to rotate the screen vertically! They give you an HDMI cord and power cord for each monitor, so I was able to just follow the guide they provided and set it up in only 20-30 minutes.People have complained about the audio and the refresh rate not being 75 Hz...so I was hesitant to buy it. But I saw some other reviews and was able to toggle the menu and adjust the audio for both monitors, so I am able to get really good sound! Also, if you want to change the refresh rate, literally all you have to do is download Graphics Command Center on the Microsoft Store, go to Display settings and literally adjust the monitors refresh rate from there. BAM! 75 HzThe only reason why I am giving it four stars is because I wish there were more USB ports on the monitors. I realize now I may actually never use the VGA port...also, I am not certain the warranty on these devices, especially from Amazon, will totally help me if anything were to happen to these monitors.But so far, I AM VERY PLEASED WITH MY PURCHASE. :)

They are actually pretty good.- Whatever all the stats are that denote how smooth the action is and how little choppiness there is - this is wonderful. I do not experience any discernible lag with mouse movement or typing.- Comes with an HDMI cord!!** My MacBook has a Mini DisplayPort only, no HDMI, and I knew I would need an adapter. Thanks to a knowledgable reviewer I knew to buy an ACTIVE Mini DisplayPort to HDMI Adapter. Apparently this is an important distinction. The adapter was about twenty dollars, which I had no problem paying for a good piece of equipment. I must have made the right decision because the connection seems seamless.

To attach the monitor to the dual monitor arm setup I bought, I had to purchase a ""Vesa 200mm X 100mm Universal LCD LED Bracket"". This is the one I bought:  https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00U3DQO6I/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o01_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1I also had to purchase additional screws because the ones included are too short. I bought M4-0.7 x 18mm screws from my local hardware store which fit my monitor. Good luck! The picture quality and brightness are good. I lowered my overall rating because I specifically bought these monitors because they were advertised as VESA compatible. It was very disappointing to get them home and discover I needed to purchase additional hardware.

  Fantastic monitor. Needed to upgrade an old monitor at work to something with VESA compatibility. Admittedly I bought the cheapest monitor with VESA, and this just happened to be the one. WOW! I am thoroughly pleased with this monitor. Firstly, incredibly lightweight. Setup on the VESA mount took 5 minutes, because you can hold this thing with one hand no problem. Secondly, picture quality is great! I'm not gaming on this, just typing emails, web browsing, office-type work. The brightness is adequate and easily adjustable. Thirdly, what a deal. $109.99 is what I paid, though it seems to have gone up a lot. That was my only reason for buying this monitor originally, the price. Now that it's increased I would definitely consider exploring other options just to see if you can't get more bang for your buck. On that note, this monitor is fantastic and I would buy it again, but only at the original price point.

  This was a fine monitor--for about 30 days.  Then one day I turned it on and there are lines all over it and a black spot in the shape of a leaf.  If zero was a rating option, that's what I would give it. I don't have the box anymore, so I can't return it to Amazon.  I have spent about 6 hours in chats and on the phone with HP trying to get the POS replaced, but to no avail.  They keep making promises, but not following through.  After 3 separate contacts, I was told to call back if I didn't get a confirmation that a new monitor was on the way.  Not worth my time to spend another hour fighting with them.  Not only will I say that this item was a piece of crap, but HP's service has convinced me that I will never spend another dime on any HP product ever again; they obviously don't stand behind their product so why would I?If you decide to go ahead and get this POS monitor, keep the box, at least for the duration of the Amazon return because no way HP is going to help you out if it stops working.

  I bought this for working from home so I could actually see things I was struggling with, on the tiny laptop screen. I didn’t want to deal with switching between the two laptops fighting over 1 monitor so I got this to be a dedicated 2nd screen for a 2nd laptop. This HP monitor was bigger than I realized but it’s such a relief to my eyes compared to the small laptop display. It has the capability to rises nice and tall, tilts and it was really easy to assemble in under 10 minutes right out of the box. It came with 1 hdmi cable and also has a port for the vga option if you need that like I did. I had a spare so just know you’ll need to get your own vga cable. It has a nice edge-free design (the only plastic border is at the bottom and it’s a silver color) which looks cool and gives you more screen area.

  Quarantine made me buy this monitor. I work on my laptop all day and the laptop font is too small and when I'm on client calls I need a second monitor to check my notes so I went ahead and bought this monitor. The speakers work well. Its a great extension screen. When I used the monitor alone I did find a lag but I connect it to my laptop and use it as an extension screen which has no lag at all. The display is pretty decent and I get great use off it. The screen is huge, easy to assemble and has helped me multitask. I stopped writing notes in a notebook after buying this monitor. It also comes with a HDMI cable. No need to buy one. For this price and monitor size you won't get anything better considering its a notable brand and I say this after checking so many monitors cheaper or in the same range on Amazon.

  Brightness and picture quality is good. Adjusting volume requires going through too many buttons so I keep it at 100% all the time and adjust the volume via my laptop's volume. Very happy this comes with the HDMI cord.Assembly for the stand was tricky. You have slide in the metal part of the staff into the bottom part for it to click, and it wasn't clear from the instructions. If you do that, it's easy. I wish the monitor had a greater range of height adjustment, it's too short to work with a laptop in front of so I have to put the monitor on top of a box to use it with my laptop. I haven't been able to use it vertically because it disconnects from the power cord too easily. Good for price.

",4.0,Wyrd2010,"Reviewed in the United States January 28, 2021","









  
  
    
  I haven't used a desktop monitor in some years and it will take me some time to adjust to the more basic features of this one. For the price, it does the job quite well, but cannot compare with the clarity, etc. that one finds on laptop monitors. The colors seems reasonably accurate and the brightness (250 nits) is adequate but usually has to be kept at the maximum level. This is certainly not a gaming monitor.If you buy this monitor to use it with a desktop PC for office work, it will do the job but you could probably do better if you spend a bit more. Letters, for example, are not all that crisp on the screen and while easily readable, you might find them a bit thin/dull and not having enough brightness.The features of the monitor are basic. If you wish to place a webcam on top of it, you would need one with a less bulky clamp. I used the following: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B086GQSKK3/ and it fit perfectly, the clamp staying just above the screen area.Being able to adjust easily the monitor height is a plus and installation was easy. Overall - this is a decent budget monitor that doesn't spark or dazzle but does the job fine.

    Solid Monitor-Mac Mini M1 Audio Issue
  
",3.0,L Patrick,"Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2021","









  
  
    
  This is a solid, good-quality value monitor. Bought it to use w/ a new Mac M1 and the audio volume could not be controlled through the Apple keyboard keys, only on screen w/ cursor. When using the built-in monitor speakers through HDMI or DisplayPort just the same error message: ""The selected device has no output controls."" 6 hours on support chat and phone with 4 different Apple/Mac reps could not solve the problem. All other audio devices - wired earbuds, bluetooth external speaker - work fine and the keyboard audio controls work. Just not with this monitor using the built-ins. It just does not seem to be compatible with the Mac Mini M1 in this regard. Really inconvenient having to manually adjust audio on screen with mouse and cursor in whatever app is playing audio, iTunes, YouTube, Netflix, whatever. Having to return this monitor that is otherwise acceptable and get another brand with a USB-C port and hope it works. If you have a Mac Mini M1 2020 this might not be the monitor for you if you want volume control from the keyboard. The monitor itself has no external manual volume control. I'd be cautious if you had any M1 Mac and are considering this screen.

  This monitor is great! Picture quality and brightness are super. There's quite a few brightness settings for customization - good for tweaking to your likeness. Can't think of anything bad to say about this display, especially considering how inexpensive it is. Sounds like some people have had trouble with getting a dud, or damaged screen. But mine came in perfect working condition. In fact, I'd like to get another one to replace my older monitor, as I'm running a dual monitor setup with this new HP monitor and my older Acer monitor, and the older monitor just doesn't come close to the quality of my new one. I'm using desktop speakers so I'm not using the internal monitor speakers, but I know it does have speakers (I've seen a few reviews from people saying it doesn't have built speakers?) as I just ran a speaker test and they worked just fine. The only minor issue I could say I had is the monitor stand is pretty beefy with a good size footprint, and I was trying to put this on a fairly small desk, so had to make some adjustments, but again, this was minor.

I really wanted a monitor that could be height and tilt adjusted and possibly rotated but most monitors with these capabilities are $150-$200. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of the speakers as well. Many monitors that I looked at with the built-in speakers had complaints about terrible sound so I was worried about these but where they may not be the best I think they're great! The color and brightness looks great. It was super easy to set up, just connect pieces and no screws/screwdriver required.

  I ordered this monitor to add to my existing system as a second monitor under Windows 10.  It is a good looking monitor with very thin bezels on the top and sides.  The bottom has a bigger bezel with the HP logo and power light.  It is a very stark and pleasant difference compared to my older Dell monitor that has a thick bezel on all sides.The picture quality is good but not super.  I can compare it directly with my Dell monitor that sits right next to it.  I see the difference in sharpness as I drag any app from one screen to the other.  The Dell monitor is sharp and precise while the HP seems a bit fuzzier.  This is especially apparent at higher resolution with small text.  For anything else, it really is a good monitor (especially for the price).  Pictures look good and watching videos is also a good experience.The brightness is excellent does not get washed out, even with sunlight coming in the window.  The range between pure white and black is also very good.  Overall a good monitor for general usage and for business apps.  I don't play many games, so I can't comment on the response time of the monitor.

  The monitor us a wonderful upgrade to my VGA 21 inch monitor.Overall visual design 5 stars.Speakers, and yes it has speakers. 1 star for size and placement. Use the monitor MENU to find AUDIO and adjust built in volume.If you are not using DP to DP as I am you may not have sound. Included with this monitor is a 3.5 to 3.5mm jumper cable. One end goes into the sound  out from the back of your desktop to the input of this monitor. Then you shall have a small amount of sound.Honestly, who places speakers facing the back. And, they are ridiculously small. The area they are in may be able to support much larger speakers.Sound quality is about like your phone on speaker only in stereo. The speaker size is about 1 inch or so. Facing back makes zero sense.If you look on the lower rounded back side you see where grills are. The tiny holes are where the speakers are.Do not buy this monitor for the built in speakers. They flat out suck.As for the picture/image on screen this is a fantastic monitor. 5 Stars.Recommendation: Yes.

  Product: HP 24mh - 24 inch 1080p ips monitor.For the money, this is a really excellent monitor. I bought this because I needed a monitor for a 2-month stint working away from my regular ""office"", and I didn't want to spend much money for a short term need. I'm very impressed with how far my money stretched with this product.I'm mostly familiar with working with Dell Ultrasharp monitors, which are a higher-end product. A dell ultrasharp of the same size/resolution costs twice as much as this. For half the price, I would judge this HP monitor to have 90-95% as good a screen quality. It's clear, easy to look at, and not reflective at all. The colors are bright and there don't appear to be obvious limits to color gamut. Some cheap displays I've used have whacky blues/greens/yellows, but this monitor doesn't have any such problems.The build and stand feel like great quality, with sturdy mechanisms to assemble and move the screen around. If I had to pick one flaw, it would be that the stand seems to transmit a few vibrations from the table, resulting in the screen shaking when I'm typing too vigorously. This certainly won't affect my work, but for those who wish to furiously bash a keyboard while gaming, you might want a slightly more sturdy product.Ultimately, I've used similarly-priced displays with MUCH worse screens than this. So if you want quality without spending a lot, this is a great choice.

  Let's start with the pros!-The size is good, I think it looks pretty, it's clear, has decently good speakers, can be turnt sideways, and is decent for gaming. I bought this primarily as a budget gaming monitor and to use it while I'm streaming games on Twitch.-Not too expensive-Nice looking standCons-Whenever I play any dark game like Skyrim, or see a dark loading screen from a game, I unfortunately see yellow bleeding on the sides. It's been there since Day 1. I most likely will exchange it for a new one if I can find a solution for my second issue. I really needed a monitor for streaming, so I don't have time to go days without a monitor again. This monitor does have a warranty, so I'll have to contact HP at some point if it really starts to bug me while playing games like Skyrim.-I cannot connect my Nintendo Wii. I've tried contacting HP support but no one knows the answer so far and I get an error every time I plug in my Wii saying that I need to ""change the mode"" when there is no option to change the mode. I was really looking forward to streaming switch and Wii games but I haven't found a solution for the Wii games yet although Switch games are fine... if I don't, I may have to get a BENQ or some other type of gaming monitor that is more compatible with different gaming systems.Besides that, it's great! The height adjustment is AMAZING, I LOVE that it has speakers, and it has the ports that I need! Another HDMI would be nice, but it's okay. Main problems were just the bleeding and not being able to connect my Wii. If I find a solution for my Wii I'll update this review!-@LeSweetpea on Twitch, IG, and YouTube

It's great having a huge screen without purchasing a $1,000 iMac though. I'm using a bluetooth keyboard/mouse combo and keep my laptop in ""clam-closed"" under my desk. But I really have to sit about 4' away before the pixilation gets better, especially on text and reading. If you're using a Mac, you can have the DisplayPort transfer audio (so you don't have to use the headphone wire) just go into the sound settings. Only issue with that is the native volume controls don't work, you have to use the volume slider within the respective apps.

Came with HDMI cable and an audio cable to use from your PC audio out plug. Audio quality not so good but for the price speakers are good enough. They sound about like the speakers that came with the old PC's when you bought a kit with speakers, monitor etc. included.  I hooked up HDMI to my Dell PC, it worked but the sound was not very loud through HDMI via Intel Display Audio. My Dell also has Realtech HD Audio from the audio out jack so I used the included audio cable to the monitor and the sound is much louder. For the price it can't be beat. If you want better sound get a $40 sound bar and this monitor is still a bargain.

  I got tired of hunching over my laptop - especially as my eyes are aging. Did a lot of research and this one kept coming back as a good choice. I've only had it a week, but I'm very happy. The setup was falling-off-a-log easy (just plug it in, basically). Everything comes in the box - no need to buy any cables or connections.All I have to do is get used to looking off to the side at the monitor, but I used to do that before I started using a laptop, so it's no big deal. I use it for Word and Excel doc, Canva designing and Photoshop Elements photo editing and happy with all of it. Especially nice to have the larger monitor when two of us need to look at something together. This one is big but not too big. Fits nicely on my desk. I'm not a gamer so I can speak to that.For $100-ish it's a great deal.

  Ordered this for my wife who was working from home via Citrix on giant spreadsheets, virtualized in a ""partial Excel clone"" environment that wouldn't allow for either zooming or fast moves using keystroke combos.  She was ready to chuck the gig until I hooked this winner up.  Just a day and night difference in brightness, screen angle and of course screen real estate.  Now I'm the one jealous of her.The height adjustment is a terrific plus; both height and tilt adjustments are wide-range and robust.  The built-in speakers are a nice touch, rarely found at this price point.  Speaking of price, it's worth every penny of its modest cost. I couldn't find a single shortcoming and recommend this monitor highly as a system upgrade.

    BRIGHT, CLEAR SCREEN, BUT SIZE INFO UNCLEAR
  
",4.0,follylolly,"Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2021","









  
  
    
  Just received this replacement monitor and am very pleased with the clarity and brightness of the screen.  I can't give a comprehensive review, as I just installed it.  I do have one criticism, not of the monitor itself, but of the information in the description.  I wanted the largest screen that would fit in my somewhat limited space and the product information indicated that it was close to 19"" tall.  That was the very limit of my space.  However, it is an adjustable height and can be reduced to as low as 15"" from the base.  So, had I known that, I would have probably purchased a larger monitor.  The actual graphic shows a measurement of 18.28 "" but the line showing this vertical size is only along the edge of the monitor, implying the screen itself is 18.28"".  That is very misleading.  The advertisement does say it is adjustable in height, but does not give any dimensions.  Purchasing an item without being able to see it in person is difficult and often leads to returns and dissatisfaction. I think this information would be very valuable to include in future ads.

  I bought this monitor in December and, since it worked so well, another one in January. I am using to teach (college) from home with Zoom, and it allows me to share one of the screens while keeping the attendees in the other.Connection was a breeze. If you have a dual setup in a mac you will need an HDMI to Thunderbolt / USB4.The monitor position is adjustable, both vertically and turning. The lowest possible height is really low (1.5 inches), which is very convenient for desktop setups: a monitor stand will increase your desktop real state.The screen in pleasantly brilliant, and works best with the factory setups. Good resolution (native 1920x1080). It is not 4K, but who needs 4K anyway? With a dual setup, only one of the HDMI monitors will play sound (at least with Mac), and the sound quality is underwhelming. The volume is not adjustable through the monitor settings, and the source volume only goes that far. If you plan to use this for video conference plan to use a headset or external speakers.In balance, an excellent value monitor.

  Update 1/7/21: I was shipped a new unit. Now this screen only flashes white, green, blue and red when it's plugged in. The first one displayed find on my PC so I know it's not an issue with my PC. I know this is a first world problem but the fact that I've been shipped 2 faulty products back to back is ridiculous. Companies should not be allowed to sell garbage like this. I will not be purchasing any other HP products and I suggest that you don't either.Origional: This monitor arrived with a crack on the screen. There is also flecks of ripped plastic on the edges of the monitor which makes me think that this was a repackaged, used monitor. There is typically a plastic sheet that peals off the front of the monitor and this was was already pulled off. This is pretty disappointing to think that HP is selling used/damaged products.I have ordered a replacement. Until that arrives and works as intended I'm not happy with the purchase and expect more from HP.1 star until I receive the new product I paid for.

  Bought this to use as a monitor with a Lenovo laptop.  Image displayed by monitor is about 10% too large so information is cropped from the edges.

Tried updating the driver to use HP's driver rather than the standard Win-10;  no difference.  Given previous experiences with HP products I was reticent to order this.

  I ordered one of these to complement an older monitor that I already had, so that I could work from two monitors.  It was great!  I liked it so much, I decided to replace my old monitor and get another one of these.  The second one still has a great picture quality, but occasionally it goes black.  Doesn't matter if I'm working on it or it's sitting idle, the screen will go black and the speakers will stop working.  It really looks like it's turning itself off for a few seconds, then it starts up again.  It's a bit annoying, but I threw away the box so can't return it.

  This is a nice monitor for the price. I had no problem running it at 75hz. I bought this mainly for running the new Microsoft flight simulator. It works well for that thought I do notice a little bit of backlight bleed in the corners in dark night flying.  The stand is bit more bulkier than it should be but it does make it feel sturdy. Speakers are only ok but better than nothing. Sounds better against a wall because they are backfiring. You're better off getting some bluetooth speakers. I didn't see any other monitors at this price point with speakers so that's a plus. One star off for the backlight bleed.

  A little disappointed with this monitor. I bought two of them back in November 2020 around the holidays. After a about a month of daily use for work, I started to notice a slight discoloration in the image of one monitor. The screen started to have a reddish hue to it despite having adjusted both monitors to have the same image/color settings. I tried adjusting the colors but the reddish/pinkish hue was still discrete I left. I had high hopes for this monitor, being an HP product and all, and really wanted to like it. Although the other monitor was ok, I’ve decided to return both (after reading the other reviews posted after I bought these) since I don’t want to wait for the other monitor to show signs of discoloration just after return period expires on January 31, 2021. No wonder the price was relatively cheap. I hope you will not have the same experience that I’ve had. I will update this review once I turn them both on when I return to work on Monday and show a picture of what I’m talking about.Update: 1/4/21: uploaded a picture of the reddish/pinkish hue on the screen on the left

  Nice bright crisp sharp screen. Many complain about speakers. It all depends on the quality of the recording itself. For my purposes, like a YT video or background music it's fine. Had troubles to connect the HDMI. The socket is recessed and facing down. Then realized the screen actually rotates to the portrait mode and then it's much easier. Still, they could've placed those sockets facing the user to eliminate extra guesswork. Can't get it why they still keep slapping the VGA port on? How many people have it in the computer still? Even those few who do then just by an adapter for a few bucks. This port is really a waste. But I see this is not only HP. I wish I could get an answer why they still do it.

Some folks said there are no speakers, but they are definitely there, although they face toward the back. I have it connected via hdmi and I can send audio to the speakers if I choose to (Linux).I opted to use a separate monitor pedestal for 2 monitors, that allows you to swivel for portrait/landscape layout. It also allows you to adjust the height of the 2 slightly different monitors so they line up nicely.

  I personally use the monitor in combination with my MacBook as an office setup but when I attached my ps4 it was perfect. It has 3 ports (VGA, HDMI, and DisplayPort) so, you can use it for many different things for example I have the monitor in use for my work and as an office setup in the morning, and later at night I plug my ps4 in it and its perfect for gaming. There are so many settings on the monitor itself and you can virtually change everything from the color to brightness to volume to refresh rate. It defaulted at 60Hz so make sure to change it to 75Hz when gaming. It's 1920x1080 and it is very hard to see the pixels unless ur face is touching the monitor. One flaw with this type of monitor is that you need to be looking at the monitor headon with no angle or else the colors distort. Another flaw is that the speakers are on the back so, the sound is muffled and you have to turn it up. Or else it is big, perfect quality, loud, and bright,

  I recently bought 2 of these and a dual monitor stand to replace my old monitor and an old TV set I was using as a monitor.  These are really nice monitors.  You can also set them so the irritating LED lights don't come on.  This is very useful if your office is in your bedroom or somewhere else you don't want LED lights always on.  Resolution is good and screens are nice and don't burn your eyes.  Dual monitor stand works great with them and the frame is very thin on the sides so it appears as 1 monitor if you extend your desktop.

  For those of you complaining about the quality monitor’s audio, it comes out of the box set at 50%. Use the buttons on the bottom right if the screen to adjust the volume to 100%. The audio quality is great. I tested it out for myself. It’s loud and much better than what i’ve read in the reviews. I’m waiting to set them up to my docking station and then i’ll do a thorough review but so far, very good.

    Awesome monitor
  
",5.0,ByronW,"Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2021","









  
  
    
  I needed a replacement 24 inch for my desk, and initially ordered a different brand, curved 24. The curve was OK, not life changing or all that cool, but it was OK. That monitor however, would NOT wake up after going to sleep with my PC. I tried power settings, I tried all that vendor suggested online, no help. I got tired of having to power off the PC and back on just to WAKE UP THE MONITOR, I returned it and bought this.Best decision ever. Flat, beautiful picture, IT WAKES UP every time, just like it should.

    Great monitor but NOT 75hz refresh rate
  
",3.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States March 21, 2021","









  
  
    
  While I still think this is an excellent monitor for the price buyer beware, this is NOT a 75hz refresh monitor!  After using the monitor, checking the user guide, manufacturer site, and engaging through live support with Amazon this is in fact not a 75hz refresh rate monitor.  It is only 60hz.With that being said.  If you are looking for a cheap, excellent monitor for something as simple as work then pull the trigger.  I am considering a second one.  Now do you want to use this monitor for graphic design or gaming? No.  Spreadsheets and email?  Yes. Speakers are a nice touch, nothing special, they are just monitor speakers.  Decent amount of inputs.  Adjustable easy to remove stand.  Monitor works on my Vivo dual monitor stand without any modifications.  I have it currently setup up as a vertical standing monitor and it has been working great.  Despite the free returns and the misleading information I have decided to keep the monitor.  The next price point for better monitors is not something I am willing to shell out my money to get for my simple needs.The reason the item received a 3 star rating is the description.  It is misleading in multiple places for the refresh rate and after pointing out the issue to Amazon the description has not been updated.

  I got this after my husbands continued insisting that I get a new monitor for my home computer.  I am very frugal and hate to buy something new when I have something that seems to work fine.  But I agreed to buy it, and I do have to say I am happy with it.  It is the right height, and size.  It is clear in picture quality.

    Good but delicate
  
",3.0,BrianK,"Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2021","









  
  
    
  As a monitor, these are excellent with one proviso: they are delicate. I ordered two, one was damaged in shipping, the replacement has now cracked moving it around on the articulated arm that holds it. Speaking to the sound, brightness, size, price and value, all 5 stars. I have ordered a third because I love the screen clarity but I know that it needs to be put in place and not adjusted without being specifically careful not to grab the sides or top of the screen in any way that forced pressure on the glass.

    A 75 Hz, 1080p IPS display for $109.99? What value!
  
",5.0,Eric Dawahare,"Reviewed in the United States November 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  Seriously, my main monitor is an ACER one that is tailored to gaming, 144hz, IPS display with 99% sRGB Color-accuracy, Gsync/Freesync compatible, etc, and while this display may not have all of those amenities, for literally a third of the cost, you have a monitor that visually, is virtually identical in terms of fidelity and quality. I cannot recommend this product enough at it's price-point, I use this solely in Portrait mode and love having it as a high-quality, budget-friendly second option, however, the one thing I will note is that you will have to manually set that 75 Hz refresh rate yourself. At least, I had to!

Worked well with my desk arm mount. I am not a gamer nor a computer expert so I cannot speak to specs, however, the picture quality is good for what I’m going to use it for, which is school and work. I just need to be able to zoom and do assignments. If you need it for entertainment, I can’t help you there. Happy shopping!

    Poor color/contrast compared to a 5+ year old LG
  
",2.0,Zak,"Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2021","









  
  
    
  These things have the grayest blacks I've ever seen in monitors. The color is all washed out and the contrast is terrible. For reference, the center monitor is a 5+ year old LG and it blows the doors off of these. No, the viewing angle doesn't matter. Only gave them 2 stars because they turn on and display something resembling a picture. No way they cover the full RGB spectrum though.

  I added this monitor to my new laptop computer in place of its smaller screen and it has worked very well and made seeing documents much easier. It is the perfect size to have two pages of a word document at 100% side by side. Previously I had a 21"" and this seems so much larger.Fast warm up and easy to install even with limited ports on a laptop, so no need for a docking station. Oher reviews noted that sound quality is not great but since I just use it for business software it is not an issue.

  I got monitor to use with a laptop while working from home. It was easy to set up and the windows 10 pc laptop installed it immediately. Using the included HDMI cable to connect it was a breeze. The image quality is very crisp and clear. It is set up in an area right next to a window, but the brightness of this monitor is really good, so there have been no issues seeing what is on screen. The built in speakers sound clear when used for conference calls (which is a huge plus because the laptop speakers are garbage and I prefer not wearing a headset or headphones all day for work). This monitor is a great investment if you’re in the market. I would definitely recommend it.

  I started working from home and the monitor (one) that my work sent me home with was not gonna cut it. I read some reviews which made me second guess my purchase. Screen bleed is what I read but I'm not seeing that at all. I love how you can adjust the height and angel on the screens. You can even run them sideways. You can also use VGA, HDMI and Display port to connect them to your computer. Oh yeah by the way, I did not by these for sound so I did not connect the cord. Sound it not what I bought these for.

    A very good value monitor
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2021","









  
  
    
  What this monitor is: a good general purpose monitor for document editing, email and web-browsing, or as a secondary monitor when you need a bit more screen space, which is my primary usage.  Especially at it's price point, it provides good value for general use.What it is not: a monitor for serious gaming, video or image editing.The controls provide a good deal of adjustment for image quality, tone and brightness, with menus that were easy enough to navigate to find what I wanted.  The ""Low Blue Light,"" ""Night"" and ""Reading settings are a plus.  Even if the out-of-the-box settings are your preferences, the adjustments are there.  Blacks could be darker, and the images a bit sharper, but the overall brightness and contrast are acceptable for general viewing.The sound is fine for general listening, whether music or videos on the web.  It's not quite as crisp and clear as the speakers on my high-end laptop, but are more than adequate for listening to news or podcasts on the web, or for some music while you work.The stand is a plus, sturdy, and adjustable for both height and tilt.  More surprising at this price was the option to rotate the screen for portrait orientation, which I occasionally need to do, and my reason for selecting this particular monitor.  That feature isn't common in this range, but made this purchase worthwhile.Overall, a very good value monitor with a strong feature set at a very affordable price.

Picture is fantastic, the no beveled edges (I Believe that is the correct way to say that)  Works out really well.  I Just purchased 2 of these to go with my 2 main monitors for work and they came packaged well, and are very nice.  Added Bonus: Inputs Consist of  Display Port (What I was looking for), HDMI,  and... VGA I Believe.. (Could be DVI.. it's been a while).  In any case.. If you need extra Monitors especially w/Display Port inputs, these are pretty darn fantastic, especially for the price!5 out of 5 Value, and 5 out 5 quality.  Not a 4k uhd, but a great monitor.

  I work in IT and have experience with many low-budget monitors. This one is not worth the price.The main problem I have with this monitor is the image quality--it is one of the worst IPS displays I have seen.Even after tweaking settings, the quality of the image is still not what I would consider acceptable for the price.Another negative is the screen brightness, while it is suitable for general use, the display is surprisingly dim (especially for an IPS panel), and you may experience difficulty using it in an environment with direct sunlight.I am surprised by the number of positive reviews for this monitor, considering I have used many other FHD IPS monitors at this price point that make this one's image quality inexcusable in comparison.

  I bought this as a 2nd monitor next to my main desktop computer monitor to use for playing on my Switch from the comfort of my desk and occasionally as a 2nd PC monitor for Discord/Browser tabs/etc. So far it has fulfilled my needs.Picture quality is not as good as my main monitor, an AOC 2367, but it does the job (you get what you pay for). The built-in speakers are good enough for when I play Smash or Animal Crossing on my Switch, I don't need studio-level audio quality for those kinds of games. PLEASE PLEASE USE THE ""HP ENHANCE +"" COLOR SETTING FOR CONSOLE GAMES! Trust me, you won't regret it. That option made all my Switch games look so much better, it instantly increased the value of the monitor by like $50.Overall I'm happy with my purchase so far, we'll see how long it lasts and I'll update this review if there are any drastic changes.

  I have had this monitor for a few days and from the moment I pulled it out of the box I have loved it.  I love the large, vivid, and matte display.  The stand for this monitor is even great.

I know even quality new products fail occasionally so no big deal I just need to contact HP to get it repaired/replaced as it is still under warranty.That is where the problem began.  They quickly agreed it was defective and agreed to replace it.  They said they would send me packaging and a return label and once they received it they would send out a replacement.  I asked if they could send out a replacement immediately if I put a credit card on file so I would not have to be without a monitor for an extended period and they said they could not do that.  OK. I will just have to live without for the 8-10 days they quoted.It has now been 13 days since they started the return process and it is still showing a status of ""Preparing shipping materials""  I contacted HP support after 10 days and they said they would send a note to the team responsible to get it moving along and they would keep me updated on progress.  I still have not received any additional information and it is still in the same state.

  This monitor was a pretty good one for me personally. I'm using it for my ps4, but when I'm getting my pc, I'm planning to use it for the pc as a second monitor. The colors look good, the speakers work, but you can not change the volume of the speakers, but the speakers are very good. You can change the colors and the brightness of the screen which I like. On the manual, it says ""Optimal resolution: 1920x1080 60hz"". It does say 60hz on the manual, but I did more research and on the hp website, it says that it goes up to 75hz, but I'm not sure if that's correct. I can not change the amount of hz I get from the monitor because I have a ps4, but with a pc, it MIGHT be different. Overall, in my opinion, this monitor is worth the price if you're looking for a cheap monitor (when I got this it had a  discount, not sure what the price would go up to later on though).

  I bought this model because it advertised built-in speakers and there aren't any. I see that the last person who complained about this did so four months ago. I don't care how good the product is - I'm not giving more than one star to anyone who engages in false advertising.

  This monitor is amazing.To be fair, my previous monitor was absolute $#!+, so perhaps I'm just giddy from the fact I can actually see things now. This HP monitor assembles easily from the package... about 60 seconds including figuring out how it went together (and this while not giving up my masculinity to study the instructions). The viewing space is amazing with the bezel so thin on the top and sides you wonder how it manages to hold the monitor in, and on the bottom with barely enough room for the HP logo. The controls are extremely intuitive, which was a new experience for me with monitors. You push a button, and arrows pop up on the screen indicating which button you need to push next to get what you want.I've only had this monitor for a few days now, and who knows... maybe it will blow up next week. But so far so good!Great job, HP. Maybe now I'll forgive you for beating us on that contract years ago.

  Good as a secondary or backup monitor.  One thing I found is that my computer has to be turned on first before this monitor can be turned on.  Seems like a small thing but if you forget and turn the monitor on before the computer is powered up, then it remains inactive.  You have to reboot and restart the process over again.  I'm not a computer expert, so I may be user error.  If you're not a computer expert either, then it is helpful to know this process.

  I replaced an older Acer Monitor with the HP Monitor mostly because I wanted to attach a new Switch gaming system to it.  This monitor works well through both the VGA and HDMI ports.  In fact, it seems to work best with the Switch gaming system.  My only complaint is that the included ""owner's manual"" could be more instructive.  I learned to operate the monitor instinctively.  Well-packaged and arrived on time.

  I have two monitors on one computer and other than one not having any sound they seemed OK.  One did have sound but it wasn't very good so I just didn't use the sound on either and hooked it up to an exterior speaker.  I've only had them for a few month and yesterday when I turned them on, I had a red streak down one of the monitors from the top to the bottom.  I didn't expect them to last a long time but certainly expected a couple of years.

With a proper HDMI ""splitter"" it was no hassle to plug these in and get them to work.  If you go that route make sure the ""splitter"" will let you extend your desktop across two screens, many do NOT do that.

  This monitor looks good even compared to the pricier monitors I'm used to at work. Good colors, viewing angle, true blacks, and looks great even at the edges of the screen.Brightness is pretty good but more expensive monitors are definitely a little brighter. I don't need to max out the brightness in my office's lighting conditions and its probably more than enough for most other people as well.

  I honestly love it. I didn't think the picture quality would be this good for this price. Its got a thin screen and is only adjustable by tilting the screen but that works for me. Very easy to setup and since I work remote and kept the box I can pack it up within minutes and go if in visiting someone. Might need a screw driver for one specific part. Not heavy either. Got one for my dad for his birthday so he can share in the secondary screen life and he loves it. Great value.

    Solid no frills monitor for home office
  
",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2021","









  
  
    
  Ordered this monitor as a secondary monitor for my laptop for remote work during the current pandemic.  It gets the job done and definitely boots my productivity as we're so used to having dual monitors setup at the office nowadays.  After one month of using the monitor started to dim out every few seconds even though I was actively in it's screen.  I ordered a replacement immediately and the vendor was quick to send me the replacement. meanwhile I suspect it wasn't the monitor but rather the HDMI to USB-C connector I purchased together with this monitor is at fault.  I hence ordered the replacement of the connector as well.  Once the replacements arrived, I first replace the HDMI to USB-C connector for testing. Sure enough, it was the connector being defected since the old monitor's dimming out behavior stopped completely.  I didn't even need to open the box of the replacement monitor before I happily sent it back to the vendor.

  I recommend not purchasing this monitor, it did not work correctly from the start. Red and green pixels dancing all over the screen and constantly flickers on and off to the point it’s unusable with some of our laptops. I attempted to get a replacement through HP and was told I would have a box to return the old one in 3-4 days and then they would ship me a new one as soon as they received the defective monitor. After two weeks with no box I called them back and they said they were out of stock and it would be “another week” (we’ll see). The speakers have also stopped working right during this time, and only make a buzzing noise. So I’m stuck trying to work from home with this monitor that never worked right from the start. I’ll honestly probably never buy from HP again after this experience.

Second:  You advertise this as ""BUILT-IN SPEAKERS – Experience incredible sound and more immersive entertainment with two built-in 2W speakers.""

Especially since I like to play online games.  Is my version of good picture quality the same as someone elses? I am surprised for $100 the quality is better than i thought so i ordered two more.

  In order to change the volume up or down it requires 24 various button presses and that’s if you get it right the first time. There are no USB ports either. Pic quality is decent and the edge to edge screen looks nice though. My keyboard has media controls which don’t work with this monitor but they do on a older monitor of mine.

  I bought this for my home office and it does the job for $100. I needed to buy a separate DisplayPort cord and the display isn't calibrated correctly out of the box (it's set at 1366 x 768 for some reason) but again, you get what you pay for. Another thing to note is that the power cord is quite short. Maybe that's normal for monitors, though!As others have noted, it is NOT 75Hz - it's 60Hz.

The only okayish feature is the built in speakers, but I use headphones all the time anyway. I use this for gaming, digital art, and for online school and I'm glad I chose this in the end.

  Excellent monitor! I originally got the sceptre monitor that came defective and was poor quality.  Decided it would be worth it to spend the money to get the larger HP.  I was concerned about it connecting to my 2015 MacBook Air, after getting a few adapters I found the mini Display port to DisplayPort cable on Amazon for $10 instead of the Mini DisplayPort converter to hdmi since that didn’t connect.  Excellent quality and makes my life so much easier with 2 monitors! Highly recommend for wfh setup, don’t know how I was able to work without it!

  This screen is great!  I ordered it for work purposes (not gaming) and connected it today. The screen is light but the stand is very heavy and it does stick out a ways from the wall but I like how adjustable the height and tilt are. I also adjusted the settings on the screen using the controls near the power button and was able to crisp it up a bit.

  This monitor has met all my needs, i use it for my small bedroom mixing studio as my 2nd monitor. The ability to easily rotate to portrait is the reason i went with this monitor over others in the same price range. I'm not a gamer and do not have an over the top graphics card so i cannot testify as to it's gaming performance. But for any office or audio editing needs it is great.The 3 input options are also a selling point, and the speakers sound better than other speakers that are on monitors. Your not going to get booming bass and crisp highs that stun, but for normal use it works.

  So far this monitor seems to work great - though be warned, it is NOT capable of 75hz - only 60hz. This is fine for me but if you're searching for a 75hz monitor LOOK ELSEWHEREEDIT: Weirdly enough after a few days of use, suddenly I can set the screen's refresh rate to 75hz. Maybe it took a reboot for some drivers to install? who knows - in any case it IS capable of 75hz, and for some reason when in this higher mode the blacks on the screen become deeper. This turned out to be good for me because they were too bright before!

Since I typically use my headphones though and have my own pair of speakers I don’t really need them. The sound quality was pretty decent from what I could tell. Really easy set up, you just connect like 2-3 parts and BAM it’s put together. I learned you could lower the monitor’s height by pushing it down on its stand- it was a surprise cause I didn’t know it could lower like that lol. I’d say it was a good impulse buy! It is 75 Hz, you just need to change it in the settings.

  This is only my 3rd day using.  It was easy to set up, colors are good, brightness is good and adjustable.  If I look at the screen sideways, a little grey circle shows up but it hasn’t affected performance and I’m not using it for gaming.  I love that it is adjustable and tilts!  The only bad thing I’ve noticed is when I move it, the monitor goes black/blank and then has to reset.  I’ve checked the plug ins and cords and they are tight and plugged in all the way.  No idea why it does it.

  Tons of reviews either saying ""great monitor buy it"" or ""this monitor doesn't actually have speakers"" - they're sort of both true, the speakers only work for me if I go into volume control on the monitor (Management -> audio -> volume) and unmute it. This would be fine if it weren't like 6-7 button clicks on the bottom of the monitor, and if the monitor didn't mute itself every time the computer went to sleep. I guess it's good value if you want a monitor and speaker combo but this is absolutely driving me crazy.

  I had purchased a really bad screen and was at the point I thought lower priced screens were all just junk now until this one.  The stand is my favorite part. It moves up and down. The screen is clear and easy to use. The only thing I could even complain about is the bottom of the screen is silver. Would have looked sharp in black. But that is nitpicky. I love this screen!!!

  For my work, I needed a built-in speaker on the monitor. When I read some reviews about this product, the complaint was no built-in speaker as it was advertised. Duet to an affordable price, I took a risk buying it. Indeed, it has a built-in speaker.

  Everything about this monitor is good for the price, but my monitor has made a constant buzzing noise since I connected to power. Noise doesn't change regardless of screen brightness/speaker volume. Based on research I will have to order a new power cord, and that might solve the issue.

    HOW TO USE BUILT IN SPEAKERS AND HOW TO CHANGE AUDIO VOLUME
  
",5.0,Vee,"Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  Some people said there are no built-in speakers. That's because you need to change the sound output settings on your computer:- Mac OS: Apple icon --> System Preferences --> Sound --> Output --> select HP 24mh- Windows: In the monitor menu, go to Management --> Audio --> check PC Analog Audio (based on another review)To change audio volume:1. Press any of the buttons next to the start button of the monitor twice.2. Use the arrows and icons to navigate the menu to Management --> Audio --> Volume3. You can also change volume settings on most video/audio playing apps.Remember that if you computer doesn't have an HDMI port, you will need to buy a separate adapter! For Mac laptops:1. Identify the model of your Mac2. Check what port it has by going to this website: https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT2017363. Buy an adapter that transmit from your port to HDMI (not the other way around). Check the product description to see if the adapter is compatible with your laptop. For example, this adapter works well with my early 2015 Macbook Air:https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07JDWR6W9/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o02_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=14. Plug the HDMI end of the adapter into the HDMI cable that comes with this monitor, and plug the other end of the adapter into your laptop.5. Then press the start button on the monitor to turn it on.6. If needed, change audio and volume settings as above.

  Bought this as a gift for my mother to replace a much older 22"" Dell monitor. It's much nicer than I thought it was going to be. 24"" very thin bezel, hooked right up to VGA port on her PC and was ready to go. The speakers sound good for back-facing monitor speakers. They are not audiophile quality but perform fine when listening to music and/or talk programs at a reasonable volume. For those who don't know, the speakers default setting is 50%, you have to go through the tedious menus on the monitor to increase them to 100%. Not only does this monitor tilt up or down, but the height can be adjusted by pushing or pulling the whole screen up or down. This is a great feature I have not seen on more expensive monitors. Overall my mom is very happy and that makes me very happy. Good buy.

    The refresh rate is not 75Hz. False advertising.
  
",1.0,Tom Schmidt,"Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  It's 60Hz, not the 75Hz as advertised. The instruction manual says 60Hz, the manufacturer's website says 60Hz, and if you try to change the settings it only gives you two options: 50Hz ad 60Hz. Overall a good value for the price of $109, but it's inconvenient and unfair to be lied to. Huge waste of time. If you are looking for 75Hz, buy a different product.

  I use this as a second monitor. I like that it doesn't need a stand as the base and length of the ""neck"" is long. My other monitor needs to be up on a stand so together, they match up.  The tilting and bigger viewing angles were also important. I couldn't see how the height could adjust but I didn't need it to be higher so I didn't keep looking.  There were no assembly instructions in my box but it was intuitive. Screw the base to neck then slide/attach the monitor. It came with 3 cords and I only required the 2 (power and hdmi).  The sound quality is fine, nothing special. I really like it and glad I chose this monitor. Yay! :)

    Good 75Hz monitor for the price
  
",4.0,Asim,"Reviewed in the United States October 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  The monitor is great for the price. I can use this monitor in either landscape or portrait mode. I have bought another HDMI switch and connected two inputs to this monitor. The monitor is set to 60 Hz by default so you will have to change it t 75 Hz. The speaker is not that great because it doesn't sound loud enough but I guess it's a nice feature to have anyway. The bezels are almost non-existent. I kind of wish that the bezel on the bottom was black because it would blend so well. Also, the monitor is easy to setup as it doesn't require you to have any special tools. One problem that I am facing is that the power cable is very loose on the back where it connects to the monitor and the monitor turns off if I move the power cable around. I am not sure if it's the male adapter on the end of the power cable or the female adapter of the monitor itself but I plan to contact the seller regarding this issue and return it if the cable issue isn't resolved. Other than that, the monitor is good for the price.

  I got this monitor for working from home. It's been great for work! Since this monitor has built-in speakers, on some weeknights and most weekends I use it as a nice small secondary TV by connecting my Roku to it. So during weekdays it serves me very well for work purposes, and some weeknights and most weekends it also serves me very well as a secondary TV.Regardless of whether I use it for work or as a TV, the picture quality and sound from the speakers are great! The menu system is well done and gives you enough control to alter the picture settings or adjust the volume of the speakers.All in all this is one of the best electronic devices I've purchased in recent memory! To echo the title of my review, this is a fantastic monitor for a fantastic price!

",3.0,Joe R,"Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2021","









  
  
    
  Major pain in the b****.  I use this as an extended monitor for my son's school Chromebook.  Once the Chromebook has gone to 'sleep', to get the monitor back on each time I've to unplug and plug back the HDMI cable.  I've used LG and Samsung monitors of the same category on the same Chromebook, never had this issue.  Decided to get this model because of the built-in speakers.  Then the speakers sound worse than the Chromebook's built-in speaker. Also, it takes longer than the three other monitors (LG, Samsung, Dell) of the same category I use.  Being a long-time user of HP computers, I'm very disappointed in HP.  I've already given up on their printers.  That's another story.

",5.0,Corbin,"Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2021","









  
  
    
  I expected this to be 60hz and without built-in speakers due to some of the reviewers alleging false advertising. Now that I have my hands on it I can confidently say that they do not know what they are talking about. The display runs at 60hz by default, but can be set at 75hz in the display adapter settings (not Windows settings, the actual adapter settings). The speaker works fine, and sounds decent if you keep your expectations reasonable. To clarify I have it connected with DisplayPort, so I cannot vouch for HDMI but would expect the experience to be the same. I got this to use as a second screen in portrait orientation, and you can't beat it for the price. I needed something that was cheap to use for displaying digital textbooks, and for that purpose I really don't have any complaints.Pros: 75hz, bright, colors look good, included stand swivels (clockwise only), DisplayPort and HDMI inputs, built in speaker is a nice touch and doesn't sound too bad, arrived within three days w/o prime.Cons: The silver bezel looks a bit odd when in portrait (who cares), 5ms response time acceptable but not ideal for gaming.You could game on this, but might want to spend a little more on something with a lower response time. For day-to-day browsing, watching videos, a second monitor, and light gaming you can't go wrong with it.TL;DR: yes it's 75hz, yes it has a speaker, worth my $110, would buy again.

    What a bummer.....no DisplayPort or VGA cables.
  
",3.0,Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  Our company ordered 20 of HP 24mh monitors to replenish our stock. Our company uses computers that require the use of DisplayPort cables. To my surprise, the HP 24mh model only came with the AC plug, HDMI, and audio cable. The previous HP model we bought were P24 G4 which came with DisplayPort, VGA, and HDMI cables. So we figured this model HP 24mh would come with the same cords, however this is not the case. Both the P24 G4, and the 24 mh have the exact same specs. Me personally, I would go with the P24 G4 to have a variety of display options.  Unfortunately, we now have to purchase DisplayPort cables for our newly purchased HP 24mh model displays......real bummer...

    Great for gamer on a budget, or as a backup.
  
",5.0,Roz1281,"Reviewed in the United States March 21, 2021","You can read a far better review than what I'll provide on displayninja.com, if you want a more technical write-up. I am reviewing this from a budget gaming / everyday use standpoint.

I've been impressed with this monitor for what I paid for it, so far. I use this as my main monitor right now due to budget concerns. I bought two, so I can use dual monitors in the future, or as a backup. I'm reviewing this product as a budget gamer, not as someone who needs perfect color or accuracy.

The monitor has very low input lag (this has nothing to do with advertised response time; read up on input lag if you don't know) which is great! I previously used the ASUS vh236h, which was a monitor that was used for years in professional fighting game events. This feels the same or better to me, though I do not have professional testing tools available. It rated ~10ms on displayninja's review.

The monitor runs at 60hz or 75hz. You can set it up in your graphics card control panel. I experience one bug where when I set the scaling on my nVidia card and each time I choose 60hz, it defaults back to 75. This is only for the scaling options - the native resolution of 1920x1080 runs at either. Also, the game Spelunky locks at 50 frames per second, regardless of the setting in my graphics control panel. This IS a known issue with Spelunky that I hadn't experienced on my old monitor. I can fix it by keeping VLC open in the background while the game is on. I wanted to mention this just to provide as much detail as possible about my experience.

I use the monitor in portrait mode for pinball, and it's nice having the IPS screen so it is viewable from either angle, if I am slightly to the left or right (playing with two people for example). There are no issues tracking the ball, or any extreme ghosting using the default settings. It's even easier tracking the ball at 75hz, but this can screw up some physics in certain pinball games.

I also play a lot of oldschool Doom - online and off. It's a very fast paced game, and monitor performs well for what it is.

As far as inputs, I use the Display Port input, and had to purchase a cable. Be aware that if you have an older computer / graphics card, and choose to use the VGA input, that can add some slight input lag converting the analog signal to digital. I also have my Nintendo Switch hooked up to the HDMI port. I like how the monitor switches inputs automatically depending on signal, so I can hit Windows Key + L (locking computer, which causes monitor to go to sleep after a minute), then turn on the switch and it will change inputs for me after a couple minutes.

Some reviews have mentioned that the cables come loose. So far, mine are tight, but I can see the power cable loosening after many rotations into portrait mode. Will update review if I experience this.

The speakers are actually not terrible. They aren't too tinny or grating on my ears like my past monitor. I use dedicated speakers for PC, but at the moment am happy with the onboard speakers for the Switch. There doesn't seem to be a quick shortcut button for volume, however. So I have to go into the menu to adjust. I just keep it at 10, and disable sound on my PC's Display Port connection so I don't have to worry about it.

Speaking of menus, I find this one easy to use and functional. When you hit a button under the monitor, a shortcut menu will appear onscreen right above the buttons, so you know which one to hit without memorizing them. The menu is speedy and responsive. Keep in mind I've been using the ASUS vh236 for the past many years, so compared to that, this is amazing. I do not have much else to compare it too, however.

A final note - one of my monitors had a small bit of plastic that wasn't molded correctly, and protrudes upwards from the bottom bezel. It does not reach the viewable area of the screen though, and is unnoticeable unless I'm looking for it.

TLDR:
-great for the budget gamer who doesn't mind 60/75 hz vs 120+
-low input lag
-rotates into portrait mode
-lightweight, easy to rotate and tilt (tilts backward, and very slightly forward)
-speakers are passable
-thin upper and side bezels (good for multi-monitor setup)
-easy to use menu
-no volume shortcut, have to navigate menu

If you are on a budget, or just need another monitor, and can get this <=$120, it's an excellent deal.",

  For home office use this is amazing. Just unboxed, assembled and plugged in.Surface is matte and picture quality is more than sufficient for office use.Speakers are ok. Good enough to watch a YouTube music video. Are they great. No. Above average, yes.Pros: this monitor adjusts to so many heights and tilts and even goes vertical. Which is why I bought it. Not at all hard to switch back and forth.Unboxed and in use in under 30 min.As long as it lasts 2 or 3 years I will say its definitely worth it.

  Arrived with no damage. Setup was difficult, could not get Mac Pro to recognize second monitor. Checked all settings, no help. Searched internet, no help. Ready to give up and return, decided to swap HDMI cable. All worked. Put HP HDMI cord on another component and determined that the HP HDMI cable was bad from the start. Frustrating to have a new cable bad from start.All good now. Just had to order another cable for the other component.May update after some use of monitor.

  i bought these monitors to use as my left and right side monitor to my main gaming display for the price they work but i recommend buying and after market monitor arm if you are using these in a triple monitor set up like i amProsfor the price its a monitor not much else to say the panel does its jobConsthe stand: no mater what you do it will not be level across the top and will not align to other monitors, and if you want to put it in a vertical state you better only want it on the left side if your looking to avoid the bottom bezel between your monitors because it can only be rotated one way ( you cant even remove the mount and install it upside down to get it to go the other way believe me i tried HP put little pins that have to stick through the metal plate so it couldn't be installed the other way)TL:DR - If you get this for multi monitor get an arm to mount your monitors the stand sucks

    Solid 4/5, doesn't get as bright as I'd like.
  
",4.0,Joshua,"Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  It came with *one* dead pixel out of box. I kept it because I didn't think *one* dead pixel was worth attempting a return/re-buy.I've had this monitor for about two weeks now.  As the saying goes, ""you get what you pay for"". Brightness is the weakest link; It doesn't get as bright as some that cost more money.The PPI isn't the greatest so text looks a bit fuzzy by default (it can be corrected a bit by changing the screen's sharpness).The build quality is solid.Be warned, this doesn't really have built in speakers, contrary to what the description says.All in all, it makes for a decent display for work, but it would best used as a secondary display if you already have one with better screen resolution.
