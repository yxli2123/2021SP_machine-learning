    Decent quality, but joysticks have obvious deadzones.

  Title says it all. Get what you pay for I suppose...good enough for casual/adult gamers who don't need/want to be competitive, so I may just keep it since it's almost half price of real Xbox controllers.

    Stick Sensitivity is Drastically Below Standard
  
",1.0,Eric Blazquez,"Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  tldr: Radial stick deadzones are 60% of the total movement. Unusable for FPS games.Informative version:Overall the controller gets a 1/5 rating based on the importance of the defect.The Good:95% of the controller is absolutely fine. It's super lightweight, so it feels good in your hands. The buttons aren't as smooth as on some controllers but they function just fine; no sticking or extra wobble from being too small. The rumble is nice and the cord length is ideal for PC use. Price point is great, and the controller looks and feels very similar to a Microsoft Xbox controller. Solid construction, no wobbly or loose parts.The Bad:The other 5% makes this controller unusable for almost any shooter games; the joysticks.I will preface by saying I've tested this on 5 different games and went through every setting from lowest to highest in terms of sensitivity, acceleration, and deadzone adjustments. The only thing I can't rule out is a defective controller, as I've only tested mine.The biggest flaw is these sticks have a HUGE deadzone. When moving the stick with the 4 directions, deadzone is normal. This is what i would expect from any controller. When checked 8 directions, the flaw becomes glaring. The 4 diagonals have a deadzone of 50%-60% of the allowed movement before they kick in. This makes any movement that is not 4 directional (which is 99% of modern shooters) essentially not possible. The joysticks are arguably the most crucial part of a controller and these do not make the cut. There is a certain level of quality expectation when buying off-brand equipment. It'll be 'Fine'. Not perfect, not great like an OEM version, but just fine and you can use it normally and have saved some money. This product does not make that cut. It falls below fine as it cannot function the way it NEEDS to function.If they were to correct this problem, I would say this would be a 10/10 product. As is, the 1 flaw is too essential to it's intended use to give this anymore than a 2/10.

  If there's anything that distinguishes this controller from a first-party Xbox 360 one other than the branding, I don't know what it is, and it's likely not worth the cost of buying a first-party controller.Absolutely no issues with it. Feels and works great!

    Worst 360 Knock off Controller to hit 3rd party Hardware.
  
",1.0,Barry Ween,"Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  The product is very cheap quality and the programming from controller to console will not recognize it as a controller for this console. It keeps losing connection to the console despite being a wired controller, and has faulty buttons not registering button press. Direction input is atrocious and constantly is pulling to the back right and this product is new out of the box. Definitely the worst knock off brand to hit the 3rd party wave of products. Do NOT buy.

  Edit: So after a while, it did seem like they have addressed the only complaint I had about the controller and updated their page as well addressing this.Original review:So for those that play games with the controller should know the advantage of control over the keyboard is its precision in movement due to having essentially 360 direction over the 8 direction keyboard have. this is especially true for games such as resident evil 1 where the cameras are fixed so having the ability to move where you want exactly is extremely important.This controller seems to have a limited direction set which became obvious when I was playing around with different remote and notice that this controller will make characters snap towards a direction rather than gradually turn. What this means is the remote has a limited movement direction in comparison to some of the higher end controllers lacking precise control of the movement.

    Works great on 360, not on PC
  
",4.0,TheStorySoFart,"Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2019","









  
  
    
  Maybe I got unlucky, but I get major stick drift when trying to use this on my PC. I bought it so that I could play old 360 games that weren’t backwards compatible on Xbox One or available on Steam, and it works perfect on my 360. However, for whatever reason, it starts acting up on my PC. My other controllers don’t at all.But I didn’t buy it for PC, just happened to plug it in one day and try it out. If you are buying this solely for PC, be aware that you might have an issue. Really good price though so not too much of a gamble in my opinion.

    The right stick won't start working until 5-10 seconds after a game loads
  
",1.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States March 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  As I said in my title the biggest issue with this controller is that all the buttons work normally except the right stick will not start working for 5-10 seconds when starting a new game or loading a save. Sometimes it only takes 5 seconds sometimes it takes a full 10 depending on the game. It happens the worst in the Outerworlds. I bought this to replace an Xbox branded controller that was drifting but I would rather deal with the drift than the right stick bug. If you have a saved game when you are being attacked and the right stick doesn't work for 10 seconds after you load you are going to get killed every time before you can even look around. I am tempted to give this a 1 of 5 but since everything works except the stick I'll grudgingly give it 2 stars. Would not recommend this brand to anyone.*edit*The controller completely died one week after my initial review. None of the system I tried to connect it to even recognize it anymore. This isn't even deserving of my initial 2 star rating.

I'm very much so looking at a higher end PC controller (Xbox, Steelseries, Astro, Razer, etc.) but cant justify it as long as this thing keeps working just fine. Both a curse and a blessing really.

  The longer cord is the primary reason I chose this model, it already has proven better than a previous controller.  The only reason why I don’t rate it higher is because it doesn’t aim as well for some PC games.  The thumbstick aiming is laggg....OverCorrected w/in minor movements (a game issue, doesn’t apply for all games)

    Issues But Not Buying $ony's for the $$$
  
",4.0,Brother MOLOCH 969,"Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  I got sick and tired of the continuous wireless replacements for the 360 so I decided this time let's try a wired one, especially this time for myself because at my ripe old age, I figure I can handle it with much more delicacy than say my son can who is a terror with these controllers when he plays video games.Thus far for the low price (almost less than half) of what a $ony replacement would cost, even a wired $ony Xbox controller for the 360, I was pricing them over forty bucks. It fits well in my hands. Easy to use. Comfortable. Everything is pretty much the same as you would find in an official Xbox controller.... except....1.  The panning sticks tend to push things too fast and too far on many video games such as Fallout like when you're picking locks in the game. This makes lockpicking for the PC very frustrating. It's not easy to get the posts to adjust correctly even with the game's adjustment settings set to the extreme where this issue SHOULD be resolved, yet it is not.2. The central controller button requires you to hold it down for an eternity to send a signal to the Xbox for it to wake up and play; whereas the official $ony controller you hold the button for 3 seconds and the Xbox 360 immediately turns on.3. Not certain WHY, however, there have been several times after a long day or night of gaming, I have had to virtually unplug the cable from the front of the 360 base, wait 5 seconds then reinstall the controller. At this point the Voyee controller lights up and responds whereas prior to this it sat lifeless.  This issue is sporadic.Overall if you're trying to save $$$, then give this unit a try. I gave it 4 out of 5 stars for the reasons mentioend above.

  I'm using this as a control for my motorized telescope through my Win10 Pro laptop. The control software will utilize an Xbox or compatible gamepad, and this controller works with my application. Windows device manager recognizes this as an Xbox controller.  The joysticks and buttons work as expected but are not as responsive as a true Microsoft XBox controller. I have a wireless MS Xbox controller for comparison. However, this will be adequate for my use.  One glitch was that the USB plug was partially crushed and needed to be carefully reshaped with a needle nose pliers prior to use. It inserts into the USB port OK, but is a bit tight fitting.  It was not worth returning the controller, but should not have been an issue with a brand new item.  For the price this is an acceptable item, but is only recommended for those who do not need a top quality controller.

  A great controller I'd definitely recommend. It feels great and has weight to it, not like some cheap shell knockoff, and has a nice long cable. Works with both my 360 and pc, just plug and play.If you're looking for a great wired controller, this is it.I did had an issue with mine, but Voyee customer service was quick to respond and help. I'll be buying a second for some split screen gaming with friends soon, just like the good old days.

    TL;DR: Casual play use? Yes if you don't mind a bit of dead zone. Competitive play? Absolutely not.
  
",2.0,Trent,"Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2019","









  
  
    
  Only reason I'm not giving a 1 star is because it does the basics of what a controller is supposed to do. However, if you're planning on playing any kind of game that needs precise aiming, do not buy; the deadzone in the sticks is ridiculous, and the buttons are not very sensitive either. I play competitive Rocket League and for me personally this controller is literally unplayable because of the dead zone. I bought this because the rubber grips on the sticks of my other controller came off and needed another one (it was a gamestop brand ""xbox"" controller, but there was little if no dead zone, can't remember what I payed for it, not much.) If you're looking for a cheap controller for casual play then go for it, it works ""fine"". If you're looking for a controller to use competitively, buy a more expensive name brand one. You get what you pay for.

  Having grown up on PC games and without a console, I've resisted getting a controller, but since a LOT of games now on PC are console ports, it is pretty much a necessity.  My previous controller was old and incompatible with a lot of games, and this one seemed to have the best reviews for a low price.I still don't use it for anything with ""3D look"" as the thumbstick is just awkward compared to mouse for me, but all side-scrollers and driving stuff, and right now the game Hades, work great.  It feels kinda cheap/plasticy, but does the job.  Buttons and stick still seem good.

  As many others have pointed out, it does have a pretty bad dead zone.  Really bad, If you compare it to an official Microsoft controller, which has no dead zone at all.  So this is not the controller if you play FPS games.  But, most of the games I play on computer do not require that kind of precision, so it's fine for me.  As far as build quality, I've purchased other generic controllers around this price and they have been much more poor quality.  Cheaper plastic, shoulder buttons broke right away, which are important for games like Gang Beasts.  This one feels really solid and works fine with all the types of games I play.

    Works just like the OEM xbox 360 controller, little heavier, material little rough feeling
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  This controller works great for my PC. I usually like to play grand theft auto V on a controller but my original xbox controller joy stick was starting to go bad on me. This was a really good replacement. It works exactly the same as the original controller. All the functions and such are all the same. If you were to press the home button, it would bring up the windows menu to modify the control. The controller does not feel exactly the same as the original. I would say it is a bit rougher on the material. I held it with my original and it did not feel as smooth but the grip was fine. It did not fall out of my hand or anything. The joystick took a little time to break in and feel comfortable with it. I played gta v for a few days and finally the joystick felt a bit more smooth in movement. The buttons feel pretty good and also need to be broken in a bit. They are responsive and can withstand some button mashing from certain games. The directional buttons are also the same. There is plenty of cable length as well so you can run this from your computer as needed. The cable is pretty thick and well shielded so you do not have to worry about easy punctures or cable fraying at the neck. This also works on the xbox 360 controller without any issue. I was able to plug it into my xbox 360 and it works right away. There were not issues in performance. There was absolutely no lag or drifting on this controller. The keyboard attachment as well does work with this although I do not use it for this as I have my PC keyboard to work with this but it works. It is the same size but again for some reason a bit heavier than the original controller. I would not say it effects performance but it is interesting to notice that. The LED light in the center is the same as well it will illuminate and go to play 1,2,3, or 4 depending on the controller position. Overall I think this is a good controller to have for your PC or xbox 360. You do not need to worry about batteries, the responsiveness is great, and I have not run into any issues with it during the game.

  Two words Dead zone.  The sticks have a larger dead zone than an actual Microsoft controller.  This is a fine inexpensive controller that will work fine for a lot of game types.  Shooters or anything you need to aim in it was much harder than with the genuine.  These the sticks don't register input until you've moved the sticks farther than on a real one and when they do it's at an amount comeasurant with how far the stick is so your cross hairs or whatever moves faster than you want.  Tested Bach to back playing borderlands pre sequel.  It's much harder to aim with this than genuine.  Playing Madden couldn't really notice.

  Sticks have almost no range where they have intermediate input--it goes from no input to max input very quickly, with a bit of stickiness between no and some input.

  Honestly, this controller is absolutely horrible and a giant waste of money. I used it for a couple weeks, but wound up getting a real X-Box 360 controller, from GameStop. I absolutely hated having to do that, because I think GameStop is garbage.The reason I had to do that was because the analog sticks, for this garbage Voyee controller has terrible output. If I was playing any games, that required small movements, such as Call of Duty, I simply could not play it. I could not make small adjustments, with the aim cursor, because the analog sticks just weren’t sensitive enough.I can’t stress enough. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS. You’ll thank me later.

",4.0,Gavin Betterman,"Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  This controller is all around pretty decent especially for the price. The only thing that bothers me is the little bit of dead zone on the analog sticks. In a game, for example, Fallout 4, it is fairly important to have pretty much no dead zone. You have to move the stick more than desired to make tiny adjustments. Putting sensitivity down to compensate can be a disadvantage. Overall, I'd say if you're looking for a solid and responsive controller for FPS games, don't get this one. This game is great for games like fall guys or other things that don't require as much precision.

  Got this to replace my ancient XBOX360 controller that is finally showing signs of aging. Out of the box, the X button on this is barely functional- I have to press it really hard for it to register. That's unacceptable. The overall build of this controller also is in general not very good. The buttons are deep and buried in comparison with the official controller- but that is to be expected.

Buttons all perform with ease and haven’t had any kisses after going through each button.Now, not really anyone’s fault, but annoying.

    Squishy Buttons, but Works Great
  
",4.0,Rob,"Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  I think this is a great little controller for most things.However, if you game much (like myself) and if you buy a lot of controllers (like myself) then I will say that the buttons are a bit squishy feeling, especially the triggers.  I greatly prefer a crisp trigger that immediately bounces back so you can feel a strong tactile sensation of clicked and unclicked.  This doesn't give you that.Don't get me wrong- the triggers work just fine, and you can adjust to it and just trust that it truly is in or out... but it just isn't a crisp toggle like many other controllers.For me this is a big enough deal that this controller is now firmly a kid-only controller.  But it works great for them, and I've had zero problems with it.

  I bought this to replace an actual Microsoft XBox360 controller I had been using for years.  The weight and feel of it was great.  It felt very much like the original.  But from the start I noticed the analog thumbsticks weren't quite as accurate.  Considering how much cheaper this was, it was a fair trade-off, and didn't really interfere much with my games.  But then after only about 2 weeks, I started noticing the thumbsticks would sometimes start drifting.  First it was the right stick, but the left stick started doing the same thing shortly after.  Now about 3 days later, it's getting to the point of being unusable.  I'm going to try to replace it and I'll update this review after that experience.

    Massive dead zone; dead after 2 weeks of use
  
",2.0,Andrew W.,"Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2021","









  
  
    
  First, the positives; the controller feels just like a brand-name one; it's comfortable, the buttons have the satisfying tactile responses, and true to the advertising, its d-pad and sticks are both sensitive to the full range of motion. The price is also pretty good. It also was a perfect plug-and-play for my PC; no drivers needed, and it worked out of the box.The two major downsides: first is that the dead zones for the joysticks are massive. By my estimate, the middle 20-30% of the stick's travel is not associated with any input, even after calibrating the controller (e.g. through Steam). This means that while gross motion and corrections are possible, any fine control (e.g., adjusting long-distance aim when playing a shooter) is extremely difficult.The second one, which prompted this review, is that it did not survive 2 weeks of moderate use. I'd bought this controller months ago but was unable to use it due to personal time constraints. Two weeks ago, I got a break, and have been using it daily for a few weeks. This morning, the controller was dead; the lights flash once, then go dark.The dead zone issue is annoying, but manageable, but now I've not gotten a full 2 weeks of use out of it and it's dead forever. Unfortunately, I also can't find out how to contact the seller (due to the time since purchase) so I can't test the good customer service that others have reported.

  This is such a great controller and it feels really great in your hands because the buttons feel nice and the joy sticks have a good feel to them. 10/10 would recommend for anyone searching for an xbox 360 controller without the $60 price tag!

  Can't complain about the price.  No major issues on it, works fine.  Fits fine, feels fine.  However, the analog sticks are a bit stiff.  It's hard to explain, but my movements on video games are much clunkier than when I used my other controller (Duke Hyperkin).  It works in a pinch, but for precision games it just isn't doing it for me.

  I had been using this controller for 4 months with no issues but then the wire connection encasing to the controller ripped from the regular bending of the wire. It still worked, with sometimes pausing when it was moved, but I was worried it would tear off after little use. I contacted the Voyee customer service and got a quick response same day for offering a warranty replacement (controllers comes with a year warranty) or refund. In sum, the controller works well for most PC games and felt almost the same as the old Xbox controller, but the wire bending issue might become a problem after more then a year of use. But for $15 can't complain since its far cheaper then official Xbox controllers.

  $15, can't complain a lot. I use this mostly for Rocket League on PC. It worked well for the first 8 months or so. Buttons always felt a bit stiff, but I can work with that. Now, even though the trigger is not stuck and the controller has been well taken care of, the right trigger seems to always be slightly on or ""pulled."" The game doesn't react like the trigger is being fully pulled, but it does stay on the gas when I'm not touching anything and my friends list goes crazy (trigger is mapped to both depending on if in game or in menu).If you just need something temporary, don't take care of/break controllers, or don't want to/can't spend the money on an official Xbox controller, this would probably be okay. I play 2 or less hours a day with it so that's not really a ton of hours before this issue started. I can't stand the problem with the trigger now so I'm just going to go back to an official controller.

  This controller was exactly what I needed. Had an old Xbox 360 with broken controllers that a few of us share and wanted a cheap alternative so I didn't break the bank. This controller has held up great so far and feels close enough to OEM. Obviously you will be able to tell that it's not the original controller but plays just like one with no input lag. Would def recommend and will buy again!

",3.0,Dany,"Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  Long story short: This controller is good for anything that DOES NOT require accuracy and precision.The entire controller is built well and feels like a good quality product, the issue lies in its actual functionality. The joysticks are NOT accurate, and have a pretty large dead zone before it starts to detect any movement. As an example, when I used this controller on GTA5 while driving, the steering is very obviously not precise and would behave more like using a keyboard. Some people may not notice it, but if you're an experienced user then I'm sure you won't want a controller that isnt accurate and has a dead zone. I'm returning mine and getting an original wired 360 controller, it's just not worth getting a bad product.

  This controller definitely gives decent value for the price; however, the analog stick dead zones are noticably larger than standard xbox as others have noted. I've used this controller for 8 months now and have had issues with the right trigger sticking. Recently this issue has become more pervasive and has made it just about unusable. Overall I feel I got decent use out of it for the price, but will purchase a different model as a replacement.

    Broke After A Few Minutes
  
",4.0,Ben Phillips,"Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  UPDATED REVIEW:While the original controller I received broke within minutes, after reaching out to Voyee they sent me a replacement controller no questions asked, and it arrived a couple days later. The new controller has had no issues as of 10+ hours of use.The controller itself is pretty good, perhaps not up to the quality of the original Xbox 360 controller, but for the price it beats the original. I've mostly used it for non-shooter games so far, and it has worked well. I did play Gears of War a bit with it and it wasn't super great for aiming, however, that could be attributed to the fact that I'm used to playing shooters with a mouse and keyboard and I can't play shooters well with a controller anymore. It's a good controller to get if you're old Xbox 360 controller is broken or you want an extra controller and want a cheaper alternative to an original controller.ORIGINAL REVIEW:When I plugged this controller into my Xbox 360, it worked pretty well for a couple of minutes. It then suddenly disconnected, and after a moment it started to rumble nonstop. I tried plugging it in to different ports on my 360, my computer, even my phone but all it would do is rumble uncontrollably.I emailed Voyee but haven't heard back yet, I'll update my review with the results of their customer service.

  I really wanted to love these controllers. My wife and I just ordered three to complement her one OEM controller without breaking the bank. And, for the money, they’re decent. Really, I only have one complaint, but it’s major enough that it warrants a 3-star rating. The only issue I’ve seen (aside from the slight physical quality loss that almost always comes with 3rd-party devices - which in this case is negligible) is that the thumbsticks have a significant delay. On any OEM controller for Xbox or PlayStation, any slight movement of the thumbsticks initiates some movement onscreen. However, these controllers do not have this. You have to move the stick by 1/4-1/2 a centimeter before it actually sends a signal to the console. This means that fine aiming adjustments onscreen cannot happen. Where an OEM controller essentially allows for a gradual “0-60 acceleration,” these go directly from 0 to 60, with no buildup. As someone who enjoys playing games well and really gets into them, this is maddening and can ruin one’s ability to make instant target acquisition a thing. To verify that this was a consistent issue with VOYEE, I tested all three of these controllers against our Microsoft controller on several CoD and Borderlands titles, with several sensitivity levels across each game, and VOYEE failed every time.Now, does this mean that the controller is useless? Not at all. Again, for the money, it’s decent. I plan to keep two as backups or for split-screen gaming. However, I personally would not be okay using this controller as my go-to for CoD, Halo, or any other fast-paced, competitive title. I can manage to work around the imprecise aiming, but I feel no need to do so when I can hunt down a used OEM device for a similar price, even if it will take a bit of bargain-hunting.

  Detailed review below-Parents/Grandparents of Amazon, do not get your child the cheapest controller on amazon. For 15 dollars more you can get a Razer Wildcat, which is a far better controller for the money.This controller's deadzones are absolutely atrocious. This has the ergonomics of a potato (not terrible, but not great). The pressures between the two triggers are different, and the resistance on all the analog controls are too much for precise use. The d-pad does not inspire confidence, though this is personal preference.

  This is not the one. After just a few (3) months, the right joystick is already doing its own thing.

Ironically, the features you are allowed to select on your rating have little to do with the point of having a controller. shocking.

Its level of functionality was adequate enough for my purposes though, so I didn't bother to contact VOYEE. Recently, I upgraded controllers and found that there was in fact a defect in the one I was using.

I do feel comfortable with this controller and will update if my Impression if it changesCons:This isn’t a con but I see where Microsoft changed up the up the grips on the Xbox one, if you have been playing the PC with an Xbox One then you knows it’s pretty comfortable.It will probably take some getting use tooI wish the controller cable was a tab bit longer-The vibration is so soft, I don’t understand. Is that because of the game? Ah well; one star removal for that.Update (6-25-2020): Well, it worked for about a week. Don’t get me wrong it turns on, but I have to physically disconnect the controller and reconnect it to my PC for it to reinitiate vibration too.Right joysticks starting to drift when I play certain games.I also noticed their isn’t a spring reaction in the triggers like there is in the OEM 360 controller.Update: (6-27-2020) My god, tried to play MHW last night with my friend and the controller was jumping all over the place. I might as well use my Xbox One controller lol this is a joke!Update (6-29-2020): I got the replacement and if you take a look at the packaging damaged I’m shocked it arrived in one piece. Controller seems to function but I’m not holding my breath at all.

The wired connection is much more reliable than wireless.  Cord length is adequate.  Very responsive and feels great.  At about half the price of the Microsoft version you can't beat it.

  A fantastic value. It feels a bit smaller than the official controller which is unfortunate because as someone with large hands, every centimeter counts, however it’s still comfortable, just not as comfortable as the official controller.There are some quality issues like the plastic giving way when you press it in certain areas.However, the feel of the controller is right, the analog sticks are firm, buttons feel nice, texture is great. You’d hardly notice this was a third party device if it weren’t for the missing Xbox logo on the home buttonI bought this for certain games on PC, absolutely no issues getting it to work, just plug and play.Very great value, I can’t find a big enough issue to knock off a star considering what this is.

  The controllers were purchased to play kid games on the 360 so that I could save money on batteries.  Last week both controllers no longer functioned.

",3.0,Andrew M.,"Reviewed in the United States October 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is a cheap controller that is good for hack and slash games but a poor choice for shooters. Due to dead zone issues with the joysticks, precise aiming is very difficulty. I would recommend this controller to anyone who primarily wants to play games that don't require a great deal of precision. The price is reasonable and it feels good in your hands; however, if you like shooters, you should pay a little bit more for a better controller.

  The controller looks the part and overall works. The big issue is the joysticks. They're terribly unresponsive. Zero response through 3/4 of their travel then jumps to wide open. There's a VERY tiny sweet spot to get some of the ramp up and there are definite dead spots in the diagonal directions. Probably fine for small children or very casual games. Not so much for any demanding games.

  It will serve as the standard controller we have all come to know. But damned is it great when I can finish the gaming session on silly games that need controller and place my hands on a mouse.The normal xbox controller is just so horribly terrible for ergonomics. Remember to take breaks from using it every hour or two to avoid cramps.EDIT: After a couple weeks with the controller, I have noticed that it's now just randomly having the right thumbstick read as though it's point up, regardless of how it's being used. This is obviously inconvenient for any use that you might have for a controller.  It then clears up after several minutes, before doing it again.I am really unsatisfied by this bug.

  Controller feels and looks the same as a wired xbox 360 controller besides for how the buttons feel being pushed. Good cheap controller. My only problem with this controller is that it sticks when you use the left joystick up and to the right. I've tested it on different games, both on laptop and on xbox 360. Character movement lags because of the sticking in that direction. A good controller but probably a game of chance on getting one without any defects at all.

  I bought this because after years of using a wired Microsoft XBox 360 controller, I was just starting to get some stick drift, and this controller has relatively good reviews.It's fine for games that aren't demanding on the controller itself, but after only a couple months of playing Borderlands 3 on weekends, the left stick inward push failed to register consistently, and today the up position is intermittent, both completely dealbreakers in a game that, if played with a controller, requires consistent and sharp stick input.I've chucked it and am using my old drifty controller until my wired Microsoft controller (for about four times the price, sigh) gets here because at least when I hold the stick it works.

  This is a terrible controller for any first person shooter.  To exaggerate only a little, as you push further and further on the analog stick initially nothing happens, and then suddenly everything happens and your character on the screen goes from not moving to moving too fast, with not enough motion in between.  It makes me wonder if the variable resistors inside have an audio taper instead of a linear taper, but that is just speculation; I did not preform any measurements with a multimeter.  So, to exaggerate a little, it goes from nothing to everything instead of being more in control of the left or right stick's motions.  Aka, instead of being analog, the sticks act more digital than they should. However, all the buttons and the triggers work great. It's a cheap $16 controller clone of a Microsoft brand $40 controller, only the clone got a couple of crucial things wrong, namely the analog sticks.  There is also no electromagnetic shielding on the wires running from the controller to your system, which may or may not be the reason for an almost unnoticeable slowing down (when using graphics intense games) of the system as it tries to filter out the extra noise from the controller, but it is so unnoticeable it may not be fair to even mention it.  And there is no break away connector on that wire either, but it is not like I am going to let kids play on my system anyway, after all, games are not for kids ;).  (kidding). What I did find is that the controller works great with puzzle games, where analog motion on the sticks is not required so much, so I am not returning mine.  I just wish it would work much better with all my other games, than it does. Also don't buy the name brand ""Voyee"" controller for a couple of dollars more like I did thinking you will get a better controller than the no name brand controller for a few dollars less, because they are the same controller exactly, because if you look at the reviews, it show the same functionality and problem in both controllers, strange brand or no brand, there is no difference.  If you really want to get this inferior but cheap controller, it is on eBay for $13 from certain sellers for now.Update:  Voyee does have good customer service in that they do refund your money if you are not satisfied.  Thank you Voyee for the refund.  I left you positive feedback as a seller.  However, Voyee, please stop emailing me asking me to change my Amazon review of your product, as this is dishonest.

The last time they put in a quick link taking me directly to ""delete review"" and I almost hit the wrong button getting out of it.  I am concerned they may keep contacting me once every two weeks until the day I die.  If this activity keeps happening, I will be forced to take further action.)

    Does not work properly
  
",1.0,Joseph Lucero,"Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  It came fast.  It feels good in my hands.  The whole reason I purchased this controller is because I broke the rumble motors in my other 360 controller.  Was excited to feel some rumble again when I got this.  Plugged it in and it works but the rumble does not work.  Neither does the guide button.  I also cant have another controller plugged in at the same time or this one always registers as player 2 controller, making it not work for many games.  Very disappointed.Update as of 12/23/2020 - The controller is no longer usable.  Both sticks are no good.  I dont even have to touch the sticks anymore for them to do something.  Its partly because of the huge deadzone the sticks have and also probably because of cheap stuff inside the controller.  I would not recomend this controller to anyone.  Its better to just spend between 40 and 70 dollars and get a good controller that will last a long time.Update - I was sent a replacement controller.  When I plugged it in it registered as player 2 controller, so I restarted my computer so it would register as p1 controller.  After that I started a game and had the same problem, no rumble.  Tried a couple other games and some controller tester thing from the Microsoft store.  Nothing.  I unplugged the controller and plugged it back in and decided to try a game with the controller registering as p2 controller.  I got rumble.  So I restarted my computer so the controller would register as p1.  Launched a game and no rumble.  Tested it on the controller tester and in the Steam Controller settings (if you click on Identify the controller rumbles) and got nothing.  I did the same thing as last time and tried it as p2 controller.  Got rumble.  So I unplugged it, restarted my computer and plugged it in after the computer finished booting.  Finally I got rumble when the controller is registered as p1.So, I figured out that I have to unplug the controller if I plan to restart my computer and plug it back in after its booted up if I want to get the rumble feature to work when the controller is registered as p1.

They said they are going to improve the design and wanted to offer me a $25 gift card to change my review (on top of the full refund I already received). I agreed.

  I switched from another knock off (non-Microsoft) controller after it quit in under 18 months. Mind you, I grew up on consoles and controllers so I kinda know what to expect from a knock off. This controller feels really good in your hands and the first impression of build quality seems better than most at the $20-30 range. I was extremely disappointing to find the the dead-zones in the thumb-sticks (meaning the amount of movement you make before the controller actually gives any input to your computer) are huuuge. I mean, no lie, it's probably 30% of the thumb-stick movement gives literally no input at all to my computer. I have tried re-calibrations and driver updates/installs. Nothing solves the problem. It's a hardware issue and it's so bad I'll be returning it for something else. It's just unusable.

  I bought this for my son to use when we play pc games, mostly simple indy titles, so I didn't notice right away that the thumbsticks seemed to have pretty large deadzones in their middles.  This mostly doesn't become an issue until you're trying to aim in a shooter, where you need to make tiny adjustments to your aim with the thumbsticks, but it makes these types of game basically unplayable.Now, after having bought the controller less than 1 year ago (March, 2020), it seems to have stopped working entirely.  If it had been a $10 controller, I wouldn't have been all that surprised, but when the price is closer to $20, it doesn't seem unreasonable to expect a couple of years of life from an only-occasionally-used controller.

  Having played with one of these, I was excited to have a windows-compatible controller, and I found a good price and went wired, since wireless batteries wear down over time. However, the ergonomics are really cramped and not very workable; it's where the extra cash went, saving materials. I've used this 3 or 4 times ever, and owned it for under a year. After a few months of leaving it on a shelf, perfectly preserved, never dropped, cord yanked, exposed to liquid, or abused in any possible capacity. I treat my hardware like ancient relics, and am absurdly careful around them, having been a gamer since a child.Yet, I power it back up a few months later and windows can't recognize it properly and its inputs freak out. I put it off and retry a couple months later, in case it was a user error, and the controller won't even start and windows tells me the device's USB connection is busted or otherwise malfunctioning. The hardware simply isn't built to last.My advice? Pick up any competitor that looks like it's built better and seems to stand up in the reviews. Shell out the extra 10 bucks or whatever probably even. It's for the best.

  *Final Update*I am now giving the controller 5 stars based on Voyee Direct's level of customer service and the quality of the controller. The issue I was having with the first controller I received is not present in the new controller Voyee sent me (free of charge, after the return date had passed, no less).  I can highly recommend this controller.*First Update*I'm updating my review because after posting the old review, the company contacted me saying they will send me a new controller to replace my faulty one. The experience was pleasant and seamless. I haven't received the controller yet, but when I do, I will update this review. Sounds like I may have received a lemon, but the company was nice enough to replace it, so that alone deserves 4 stars.*Old Review*Decent controller, however any games that require you to click the sticks become difficult to play. Clicking my left stick in particular is very fussy, usually not working and sometimes going off on its own. Everything else about the controller is fine, but this problem makes it nigh unusable. I wish I went another route.

  So how does this compare to an Xbox controller?VOYEE is much louder. The buttons make an audible click when you press them. It's loud enough where you can hear them from the next room with the door shut.The sticks are incredibly sensitive, like a cross pad, which makes it VERY difficult to do things like, walk slowly, snipe, or do anything carefully. They are also made of hard plastic instead of rubber.The height and width are the same but it is thinner, but it's not that noticeable.It's also a bit lighter, giving it a cheaper feel.So what do I think? It's a solid backup and worth the price!If you are a gamer, you will want an Xbox controller though.If you are a parent looking to get you kids a cheap alternative, this one is a good buy.

  I gave the controller 3 stars because it works and its cheap but I cant say much else in its favor besides that. There seems to be no variation in sensitivity based on how much you move the analog sticks. If playing a shooter and you try to gently move the crosshairs over, they will either not move at all or suddenly race across the screen.

    Worst controller I've ever used
  
",1.0,Null,"Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've never used a controller as imprecise as this. As an example say the sticks are like a clock and the 12 would be up, 3 is right, 6 is down, and 9 is left. If you want to make a diagonal movement, say what would be 5 you're likely going to have it registering between 3-6. Sometimes it will land where you want and other times you'll have to struggle doing such a basic command. It's infuriating in any game, especially ones that require precision.I bought this controller to replace a different one that I'd used for years until one of the control sticks broke and I find myself going back to the broken controller because it works better than this one ever did. I thought mine was just defective, but after reading numerous reviews with people experiencing the same thing I can only conclude that it's just a terrible controller from a bad company that will harass and put unsatisfied customers under duress to leave positive reviews for a defective product.

  UPDATED REVIEW 5/13/2020: I originally gave this controller a 2/5 star review because of some dead zone issues initially and poor longevity. It stopped working after about 3-4 months of occasional use.I did not contact the seller because I assumed I was outside of any warranty or return period. However, the seller contacted me and offered to make things right by offering a refund, which I accepted.I was surprised and really impressed by this. Although the controller itself stopped working eventually, it's nice to know that the company has customers' backs in case the product ends up failing. I now have full faith in this company!----Original Review 4/17/2020: Purchased due to the price, and I understand I'm not getting top of the line controllers at this price point. That said, from day 1 the dead zone on the control sticks was a nightmare.The USB connection has never felt good/secure -it feels like I'm forcing it in incorrectly every time I insert it.We've probably actively been using this controller since January 2020 or so (ordered it early for Christmas) and now it is constantly jumping in and out of being recognized. I usually have to plug it in and take it out multiple times before the computer will recognize it now. Sometimes in the middle of games it drops the connection and re-connects on a whim.

    Analog stick/Right trigger faulty - Company compensated

  Left analog stick is intermittent. Does not register the ""up"" function 1/4 of the time. When moving forward in a game your character will stop moving. Also the R trigger would activate without input. Possible I received a bad device. The Company reached out and sent a replacement. Hopefully this one will not have the same issue.

  The thumbsticks, d-pad, and triggers feel slightly cheap on this Xbox 360 controller clone. But it also cost a third of the price of my DS4 controller.Overall this works very well, and I don't think I'll even notice the cheap feel most of the time during my gaming experience.I still love my DS4 controller for competitive gaming (Rocket League mostly). But having an Xbox-style controller makes it much easier to enjoy my casual games, without any driver issues. I just setup the Xbox options in Steam and play what I want when I want to! <3

  You get what you paid for. It works great in terms of price and feel. But the right joy stick does not detect subtle movements. Such as for adjusting aim in a first person shooter. You have to push the joy stick all the way. This makes movements feel chopy, and  un-refined. Definitely keep this as a controller for the player 2's in your life.

  I just got the controller, and I have to say, this is the first third party controller that felt good. So many of them have ridiculous design additions that make them difficult to use, but this controller felt exactly like an Xbox controller.The problem was, the controller's left stick had issues--when I pushed up and diagonal, it wouldn't work right. Instead of running diagonally, the characters started walking. I couldn't fix this through calibration. The refund process went really well--and I think this is due to the company taking pro-customer options provided by Amazon.It seems to me this is a good company who believes in their product. I might have just gotten a bad controller.  Try it out. The company is very fair in helping you solve it if it doesn't work for you.

I like having wired rather than wireless - no dropped connections, no charging or changing batteries.The ergonomics are identical to my original Xbox 360 controllers and all the buttons, triggers, and thumbsticks feel and function like I'd expect them to.  I had some stick drift issues with the grey\black controller, but VOYEE was very responsive and offered a refund or replacement without any hassle.  I used the refund to purchase another one of these Black controllers and I've got my fingers crossed that it'll work just fine.

  UPDATED REVIEW (10/22/20) - Not only are these controllers the most affordable, but the seller will make sure you are happy with your purchase. Some of the buttons went bad on the controllers and the seller reached out to help me get a replacement. Now THAT is customer satisfaction right there! Thank you!As for the controller itself, these are the most affordable on Amazon, and they aren't as heavy as the usual ones you'd usually get. The wires are pretty sturdy as well, so I'm not worried about them bending off of the main controller. The official Microsoft one I purchased is already starting to wear and tear, and I only bought it this year too. Compared to that, I think these will last a lot longer.Don't hesitate. Get these and don't be like me and forget to contact the seller if you have any issues.

  So I had looked into buying a Xbox 360 controller for a while and after researching a bit for a cheaper wired controller I found this product. I was amazed to find that not only did a lot of people come to enjoy the quality of the controller from VOYEE but they also had great support from them as well when things did not go great (controller got busted and they got replaced).So I bought a controller to try it out! Came in today 12/9/2020 and I opened it immediately and plugged it in to play, after plugging it in it didn’t work and after 20 minutes of troubleshooting I gave up and contacted the seller. Within the same day I had confirmation that I was getting my replacement controller within a week at no extra charge thanks to the warranty VOYEE provided.Would absolutely recommend buying from this company/seller because they are very reliable.

    A fine, basic, cheap PC controller
  
",4.0,Michael J. EckmanTop Contributor: Photography,"Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is a cheap, knock off of the original Xbox 360 controller for the PC.  It has the same buttons in the same locations as the original controller and does what it's supposed to do for basic gaming.  Make no mistake though, this is a cheap knock off and nowhere near the build quality of a genuine Xbox controller.  This controller is considerably lighter in weight and creaks in your hands under hard use.  The four color buttons, shoulder buttons, and directional pad feel pretty nice, but the trigger buttons have a less refined, looser feel to them.  I've had original Xbox controllers stand up to over 5 years of hard use without breaking, but I have serious doubts that this will last as long.Then again, it shouldn't have to.  For the casual PC gamer who wants a basic controller with a familiar interface, this is a good buy.  As long as you have the correct expectations for a cheap knock off controller, it's definitely worth the money.

",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  I ordered this controller about a month ago. The way the controller feels is very similar to a regular controller, but the joysticks move a lot more freely and quickly. This may not be a good thing, though, because it makes precise movement very difficult. I got this controller to play Monster Hunter: World with, and this is the biggest issue I have with it. Normally, when moving the camera with the right joystick, you can control the speed at which the camera pans. However, with this controller, you have exactly 2 speeds: camera so fast it pans right past what you're trying to look at, or a snail's crawl. I find that diagonal movement is also difficult for the joysticks. A normal controller has no problem with this, but this controller has exactly 8 directions for the joysticks, which can be a real issue at times.Other than this, the controller is fine. Compared to the more expensive controllers, this does the job. If you want a real quality product, it may be better to splurge on the more expensive ones. Price-wise, I think this product is fine as it is.TL;DR: lower price, lower quality, but quality is enough to actually qualify as a usable controller.

  I plugged the controller into my PC via USB. It works well. Until it shuts off randomly. Then I have to un-plug and re-plug it back in. Works great otherwise. Really not the worst problem ever but it still is a problem.Edit: I was contacted by the company based on my review and they offered me a replacement. I'll update further when I receive the replacement.Edit 2: Replacement arrived quickly and after extensive testing, works without issue. Rating changed to 5 stars due to awesome customer service and fast shipping.

  Controller looks good and feels good in your hand. Just like an Xbox controller. Got it to dust off an old copy of NCAA 14. The response of the buttons seems to be a tiny bit off. Not sure if I'm just out of practice or used to current generations controller responsiveness but I'm using a knock off controller and my roommate that keeps beating me is using a real Xbox controller so I'm going to blame it on that.

  I mainly bought this for racing because my original wireless Xbox 360 controller is just worn out. it would have costed more to fix the sticks & buy new battery packs for them than buy this. Looked at reviews gave it a shot. fantastic controller. the sticks are great not as good as a new Microsoft controller great, but close.  Its a bit lighter / thinner than an original one but that don't bother me as it still has more weight than a typical aftermarket one. considering the price of a authentic wireless Xbox 360 controller. this is a great replacement at 1/3rd the cost. would buy again and again.

  It is a value for the money but the buttons started sticking a couple months in. It’s not just one its like three or four at this point. It started with one and it escalated. I have dropped it several times so take that into account. Overall I’d say it is a decent controller if you take care of it. If life hands you a couple scuffles then maybe drop a few more dollars and go with something more durable.

  As many others have mentioned already, this controller's analogue sticks have large dead zones, meaning that they do not register any input until the stick is pushed a certain distance away from center. This makes it UNUSABLE in games requiring finer precision, like FPS and driving games. Don't be fooled by the rating.

  I was impressed with the ""fit and finish"" of this controller - seems to be well constructed, looks and feels just as good as Microsoft - buttons are crisp and responsive, joysticks have a good pressure and rebound feel, triggers seem to be just as good ........... and then I actually played a game with it. That's when the movement sensitivity issues came up. When attempting to make small, subtle movements you will find that the joysticks do not respond right away - and then when you do find that spot you will VERY quickly get to the maximum. Trying to aim in a FPS or attempting to hit the apex in a race is extremely difficult compared to the original, but I guess you get what you pay for. Even playing something like Skyrim or Fallout is frustrating because of the sensitivity issues.  Love/hate relationship with this one - love the feel but there is no way I can be competitive with it.

  this controller lasted for about 140-145 hours of gameplay. The main problem is there are duplicated inputs from the right trigger, d pad, left trigger, and right button; when any single one of them is pressed they all flash at once. While this could be caused by something being spilled on it, nothing came into contact with and it seems to be the result of a little humidity condensing on the internal electronics.

  This is an updated review after having communicated with Voyee customer service.  The game control I received was a bit disappointing, the x and y axis lacked sensitivity and performed poorly in situations where small inputs were important.  As a result, I had given very poor review of it; though I noted that it was fine for the cost relative to higher end controllers of similar design.  Though I stand by that review, the company made a very strong effort to offer me a refund and a replacement controller, they claimed they'd upgraded their product.  I have replaced this controller with a Microsoft brand controller however, and felt it was unethical to accept a refund or new controller from Voyee given that the previous one wasn't defective, it just was not the quality I wanted.  I added a star to my review to reflect how much of an effort their customer service department made, as well as their courteousness, in trying to reach out to me and help resolve my criticism of their product.  Bear in mind, however, I have not tried their ""upgraded"" product and cannot speak to the quality of it.

  Alright, look. It looks great. It feels great. Like an original xbox controller! But the sticks.. yeah. Not the greatest. Kind of has a lot of trouble with the diagonals if you know what I’m saying. It’s weird, but hey for the money it’s awesome! But looking back.. I should have just a little more money forward for the real thing. You get what you pay for here.. nice on the outside, can’t really trust what’s inside.Bottom line: good for platformers maybe, but don’t play something like halo at ALL with this or you will have a bad time. Trust me on this one.

  Unboxing this I was surprised how closely it resembled the OEM controllers!But after trying it out I immediately ran into issues with the left trigger activating at random and behaving as if stuck, and also noticed some drift on the right thumbstick that could be pretty disruptive.All said it lasted less than 3 hours before I got frustrated with it. Maybe a bad unit but not a great experience.

  The controller works on my Xbox 360, but there are some obvious latency issues.  It is really noticable in first person games. I go to turn around and it starts out slow, but a second later my character will spin almost 360°.  And yes, my sensitivity is set low. All in all, it is a decent, but the analog sticks are terrible.  I will be looking for an OEM controller soon...Update 1/8/21There is also a horrendous stutter when using the left analog stick to move around in games.  moving straight would be fine, but the moment i start to strafe in ANY game it causes my avatar to seize up and twitch like it cant move correctly...i wish i could explain it better but this is not a good controller.

  Totally shocked at the quality of this controller. I've had several third party controllers over the years Mad Catz, Afterglow and Rockcandy, (were some of the better ones) but this one is probably the best. It is pretty durable, dropped it several times. The cord does not seem to have the problems shorting out like the Afterglow and rock candy brands. The rumble vibration is a little softer than the standard Xbox 360 vibration. All in all this should be your first go-to if looking for a cheaper alternative to an Xbox 360 controller. You probably won't go anywhere else.

  In my opinion, this is the best third party wired xbox 360 controller. I used an official xbox 360 wired controller before it finally broke down and made the switch to this one, and I have to say this controller feels as close to the real thing as possible!After a few months of continuous use, my Voyee controller broke down(no longer recognized by my PC or Xbox, wouldn't power on etc). I sent a quick message to the company and they replaced it, no questions asked! Great customer service.

  This controller had a great feel and solid build, just like original, but it did not work. The left trigger button would not respond at all. Filed a return and had to ship through UPS instead of just dropping off at Kohls. Sent it back and still have not got a refund (not a product feature, but a seller feature). Had to delay set up of new retro system due to this delay. Really wanted to love the product, but it has to work for me to like it.

",5.0,David Kelley,"Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2020","









  
  
    
  Updated Review September 25:So, I am a week or so late with this, but after posting the original review and also sending a message to the Voyee customer service, they replied back to me on the same day a few hours later, asking for my number and address for a replacement. I gave it to them, and they sent the replacement, which came the following week (original review was on a Friday), working perfectly! Seriously surprised at how fast it all was, and also that I even got a reply from customer service the same day! All praise and hail Voyee, exceeders of expectations! (Don't care if that word doesn't exist)Original 3 star review from September 11, 2020:So I got this controller back in May 29, 2020, and up until a couple weeks ago, it worked well. The left analog stick was a little too sensitive when moving the camera in games, but I didn't mind that, I saw that as training fine motor skills, somewhat.But my issue is that, randomly and for no reason, my controller is vibrating constantly, even when nothing is on. My TV and Xbox was turned off, but I walked into my room and the controller was vibrating. I unplugged the controller and it stopped, but plug it back in and it vibrates. I turned off vibration in the xbox, controller still vibrates. I unplugged the Xbox, it still vibrates. And, as a hunch, because the controller is USB, I plugged it into my TV which has a USB port, and the controller is vibrating. Other than the vibration, the controller works perfectly, but I dont know what will happen if this continues on, especially since I only got this thing just over 3 months ago.Basically, I love the controller, but I may have to get a new one because it won't stop vibrating.

    Epitome of cheap
  
",1.0,corey Hendricks,"Reviewed in the United States September 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  It's functional as a controller, but only just.~The stick inputs are very insensitive, making it difficult to adjust for intensity of directional input. This makes it feel like one is playing with a controller built of Legos in games that require tight controls, such as FPS's or tactical stealth-shooters. On the topic of poor stick inputs, the controller does not register small differences between specific directional input. For example, one can either go left, forward, or forward-left. There is no variation in-between the three directional movements, again making precision control impossible.~Buttons become sticky after basic use. No damage has occurred to the controller yet there are times when unpressed buttons continually send unintentional inputs.For anyone buying a replacement controller, spend the extra $10-$20 and shop elsewhere. This controller is only acceptable for use with basic Smart-TV video game apps. Any use with a half-way decent title will leave you with regret.

  I bought this to play games on steam.  It worked pretty well out of the box.  The only issue that I had from the start was that the sensitivity of the joysticks is lacking from minor movements to major ones. (trying to sneak in a game by barely moving the stick vs running by moving the stick all the way).  Now, however, a few months on, the buttons are starting to be difficult to get to respond.Update: 10-24-20The company got into contact with me unsolicited and offered a replacement for the controller.  Top class customer service in particularly because I had already written the controller off.  I would definitely buy another one of these controllers.  The newer controller's are more responsive also I think they have been improved in design or something.
