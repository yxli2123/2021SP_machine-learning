  I cannot tell you how much I have enjoyed having a cast iron skillet in my life. I am not sure what took me so long? This is such a great and affordable way to get yourself a skillet that could out live you, if properly cared for. I used Primal Gourmets method of initial seasoning and it has served me quite well. I have made several dishes in this new skillet and I am quite pleased with the new addition to my kitchen.

  I like buying usa products. You do need to season and it does have odor at first so I just ran the fan while heating it up the first time. I have switched to using cast iron whenever possible with my glass top stove and induction burner. Love it. I am replacing my pans one at a time and will be buying more from lodge. I only have one problem and it is with Amazon. I buy everything from Amazon and they always use ups. I get deliveries after 7 pmrude drivers no Saturday delivery and I don't have a choice on shipping. Why does Amazon not support the USP? I love using the post office and never have had any delivery problems ever. No I don't work for them. I ask one ups driver why they deliver so late and no Saturday delivery like the post office and he smirked and said that's why their broke.

  I bought this on a whim because of its small size.  After I got it I was a bit shock at just how small it was.  However , I pushed on.  I went ahead and  seasoned it  a couple of times (pre-seasoning is just the start of the process , not the end point, then again there is no real end point in seasoning) and decided to fry an egg.  The little pan worked great.  I don't believe there is any spatula that would work with this but if you like your fried egg sunny side up you are golden.  However, I like mine 'over easy'.  That required a flip onto a plate and a slide back into the skillet.  This worked great because the seasoning process had made it very non-stick. It was a pretty good fried egg.  Perfect size for an Egg McMuffin.  I find that each time I see this Lilliputian skillet on my stove, I giggle at how cute it is.  I could be used as a spoon rest as well.

  I followed the directions for washing and oiling this pan, however, it is a mess after just 2 uses.  It looks rusty already despite my oiling it as directed.  Maybe it is because I put it directly in the oven but I thought you could do that.  Not happy with this product.

  Purchased from Amazon in Aug, 2020.  Didn't notice the crack until I added oil to fry some chops in December 2020.  Skillet had oil on the bottom and on the electric stove.  It was smoking and I wound up microwaving the chops.  After inspecting the skillet, I found the hair-line crack.  I have purchased Lodge cast iron in the past and they have always been a quality product.  This skillet is an obvious exception.  Would like to resolve issue if possible.

  It took some time to get it completely seaoned. It says it is but it has to be reseasoned after every use for awhile. I learned not to leave it wet too. It will rust but that can be scoured out. After 3-4 months of use, food pretty much doesn't stick. On the other hand, it does not function like a nonstick pan does. You still have to do a little scouring after frying meat in it but it's not hard to clean.It does seem to cook food faster and more evenly. I'm glad that I bought it because I know that in 6 months to a year of use, the coating won't be flaking off. I won't have to throw it away and buy a new pan.

  Lodge is amazing, I'm starting a collection of cast iron to cook with and the quality blows most other companies away.This skillet is BIG. If you live in an apartment with and older stove chances are this will hang over your large burners by a lot. I find I have to heat this baby slow and low to get it up to a good temp. Lots of room and is amazing for one pan dishes, large steaks etc.The holder it comes with is not nearly as impressive as the skillet though. The plastic just isn't thick enough to protect your hand from the heat of the handle for more than a moment or two unless you are cooking on low heat. Just grab a couple good ol cloth pot holders or you might get burned!

  Excellent alternative to all these non-stick cook wares.  Back to the basic like your grandma cooked it.  It works.  It’s healthy.  It last and won’t get burnt easily like those non-stick coating.  Way to go if you have to fry foods that otherwise could stick to the frying pan and you do not want to use cookwares with non-stick coating.  We still use stainless steel cookwares for other cooking that does not have the potential of sticking.

  Always wanted to try cast iron skillets so I got the 8 inch. You can pretty much do everything with it and it will last a lifetime as long as you treat it right. The first couple uses are better if you cook food with higher fat content like meats and such. After a couple uses I started doing eggs and pancakes in it flawlessly. To clean mine, I do the following while the pan is still hot, combine kosher salt with a little oil and scrub hard with a sponge or rag. Rinse and dry it, then put a little oil to spread all over. Place it over the stove until you see smoking. Then remove it, cool down, and you're ready to go for next time! The quality of this pan is amazing and USA made. Can't ask for more than that! The flavors of foods really come alive cooking with this and distributes heat evenly.

    Lodge 10-1/4"" skillet -almost 6 years old and its Perfect !!
  
",5.0,Mitch,"Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2017","









  
  
    
  Bought this Lodge 10-1/4 "" skillet in 2012 from Amazon .  It has been well used and is holding up just fine . It cooks everything from roasted potatoes and carrots to baking bread in the oven . Have had no issues with any rusting and rarely have to season it . I do clean it right after each use with hot water ,  dry it and then coat it with a bit of oil . this pan has now many memories of many family meals . I was hesitant to buy a cast iron skillet as I did not want a pan that everything sticks to and would be hard to clean . I am really glad I took a chance and got this pan .  The non-stick pans that would stick after the teflon started wearing off no matter how careful you were taking care of them , and required being replaced every year have nothing on cast iron . Once your cast iron is well seasoned it is non stick . I paid about $15.00 for this skillet and five years , 7 months  later it is in perfect condition and likely will never need replacing .  In the same time prior to having cast iron the non stick skillets would have to be replaced yearly  . I also bought the lodge cast iron griddle , in fact bought that one first a year before buying this skillet .  The cast iron griddle  is the best for cooking pancakes . Before that pancakes never cooked right . I also really love that Lodge is Made in America.  I have since purchased many more Lodge Cast Iron pans  for myself and to give as gifts to others  So far all the Lodge Cast Iron purchased  have worked just fine.  Yes Cast iron takes a small bit of care but it really is not hard to maintain .  It keeps food hot a long time and I love that about Cast Iron,  going back for second helpings out of cast iron  your food is still hot enough to not need to be reheated .  Buying the Lodge cast iron serving dishes for that very reason . It is not delicate , it is rough and rugged and will last a lifetime ( Lodge even gives a lifetime warranty on their cast iron )  I read some of the reviews that were saying the quality of Lodge had gone down . I only know that we just bought two of the 8"" skillets and two of the 2 quart pans with lids and they seem of the same great quality as this skillet bought years ago .Thank you Lodge for the wonderful Cast Iron cookware and Thank you Amazon .

  I LOVE my cast iron. I used to be a cookware snob. I have had pretty much every type of high end pan. My latest set was a Viking stainless steel set, which are great. I also used non-stick pans for some things, but got worried about the potential toxicity of the non-stick surface wearing away into the food. So I researched and came up with cast iron, which by chance my grandmother swore by in her cooking days. Granted, it takes a while to get the skillet properly ""seasoned"" and to learn NOT to clean it with soap after use. But now my pan is very well seasoned after about 9 months of good use. I have bought more of various sizes and my expensive Vikings no longer see use. Set the chain link steel scrubbers. I have the 7"" circular one for about $20 from Amazon. This has MANY other uses in the kitchen as well. I couldn't be happier.

  I've had several  cast iron skillets over my lifetime so don't understand why I am having so much trouble with this one.  I use a low slow heat and it's supposed to be pre-oiled and I add a little more oil yet everything sticks to it!  The surface of this skillet seems to have some kind of texture that I do not recall being on cast-iron skillets of the past so am wondering if that's why I'm having problems....

  Lodge pretty much leads the way with affordable cast iron pans. We have probably six or seven Lodge cast iron pans, pots, pizza stones, crepe pans, etc. They're the most affordable/durable brand on the market right now. They're great. We've converted several family members to cast iron. I feel like they need very little explanation. They're our go-to for every cooking need.The only thing that we don't use Lodge Cast Iron for is cooking lasagna. Lodge, can you PLEASE make a lasagna pan? We're outdoorsy, we cook on the oven, stove, BBQ, and, when camping, over fire pit. These work in every scenario. I just want to be able to cook lasagna in the cold of Wisconsin without having to worry about a glass dish breaking when we take it out of the oven (if you take glass out of an oven or BBQ and it's too cold outside, the glass will shatter pretty much immediately. And that's not fun!)

  About me:  Intermediate/homestyle cookI switched to iron because of the health problems surrounding some of the other non stick cooking surfaces.At first I was going to give this product 4 stars because there is a learning curve but then I decided that I should rate the product for what it is, an iron skillet.  That being said, the product gets 5 stars because it is a quality iron skillet.  I started off with a smaller 6 in Lodge iron skillet and things stuck terribly to it.  After watching numerous youtube videos on seasoning an iron skillet, I now have a method that works for me.I would definitely recommend seasoning the skillet before you use it the first time.  The directions may say it is factory seasoned, but I think not seasoning it before the first use was part of my problem on the small 6 in skillet.  By the way, I now fry eggs on my iron skillet almost everyday with no stick!I have tried many different types of oil for seasoning my iron skillets.  The oil that has worked best for me is Extra Virgin Coconut Oil.  I do not know all the science behind the different types of oil or if one is healthier than another, but this has been the only one that has worked well for me.  EVOO and Canola did not work out well.  Before I used this skillet for the first time, I cleaned and dried the skillet, applied Extra Virgin Coconut Oil and followed the oven seasoning convention method.After each use, I clean it with water, dry it thoroughly over a stove burner and wipe it down with Extra Virgin Coconut Oil, which prevents it from rusting.Pros:  Well made  Food in an iron skillet just seems to taste better, especially potatoes!  Once you get use to cooking on it and seasoning it correctly, sticking is not much of an issue.  Nice size for 1 or 2 people.Cons:  Learning curve to cooking on iron-- a lot of sticking is caused by incorrect cooking temperatures and/or turning prematurely.  I would like to see a little smoother factory surface.  I have noticed that the more I use this skillet, the smoother it gets.  Once you begin cleaning the skillet, it needs to be dried and oiled right away to prevent rusting.  Citrus foods like tomatoes, lemons etc  reacts with the iron and changes the flavor for the worse.

  The pre-seasoning seems to not stick too well, you better oil this thing and stick it in your oven for an hour before using it.  But, whatever, this procedure shouldn't scare you if you use cast iron cookware.Other than that, the only complaint is that the handle is a little shorted than expected, making it harder to lift than it needs to be.  Standard silicon handles don't fit for the same reason.  Use a freaking towel, lol

  I cannot give a very thorough review because I gave this as a gift to my single son so I am giving an extra star above ""it's ok"" hoping it cooks a small amount well.  It is a LOT smaller than I expected.  The 8 inches must be the outside diameter of the top of the pan counting the lips and then some.  It looks to me like the bottom cooking surface is about 5"" on this one, large enough to cook an egg, but not a pan of cornbread.  I confess that I didn't measure it, but I wonder if I might have been accidently sent a 6"" one.  There were not tags.  I sure wish I had gotten a larger one.  It is nice and heavy and seems smooth.  I printed out instructions for seasoning it for him and hope he will enjoy it and learn cast iron.  If he likes it I will order him a larger one.

To season the pan (yes, it is pre-seasoned, but...if you want the BEST  just coat the pan with a light coating of cooking oil and put it in the oven at 450 for 20 minutes. Then, turn the oven off and let the pan cool off. That's it! If you want to get really fancy, repeat this process 2-3 times. You'll have to chase a fried egg around the pan! Slippery!!I have owned the pans for several months and these are the only pans I cook in now. They really hold the heat, and they really are non-stick...Yes, the pans are heavy, but you'll get used to it. I use these pans on the stove top and in the oven.

  I am so happy I purchased this! I've been wanting a cast iron skillet for some time and finally made the commitment. This is a great, sturdy and well made product. Of my own fault, I was a little thrown back by the huge size of it but hey, it clearly stated it was 12 inches, which it certainty is. I just failed to picture what 12 inches would be and that was my bad, but being cast iron, you have to expect it will be thicker and larger than a cheaper 12 inch skillet. After getting it though, I'm glad it was large because I will be able to cook a lot more things than I used to be able to with my girlfriends 8 or 10 inch skillet. I was so happy with it, that I went ahead and ordered another, smaller sized Lodge cast iron skillet for smaller things. This is my first time having a Lodge product but I am very impressed with the quality and I am proud that it is made in the U.S.A. I am so happy that I didn't purchase the Chinese made 3 pack of skillets, especially after reading in the reviews about the seasoning flaking off and seeming cheap. None of those issues here with this Lodge skillet. So, unless something major happens with this skillet in the next few months (which I highly, highly doubt), I'll be a Lodge user for life for any cast iron needs! The silicon handle cover was just an added bonus and the combo was cheaper than getting just the 12"" skillet alone.

  Like everything Lodge, this is a great piece of metal.

This.  Is.  Phenomenal.  You can actually stir things around when you need to the cleanup is much easier because you have angles that are not 90 degrees, it is just such a joy to use compared to normal frustration that I have with skillets.

One pan arrived fairly smooth inside, enough to cook an egg with a lot of butter or oil and get mot of the egg out of it. The other pan arrived super textured inside, so much that no matter how much oil I put in it, the egg stuck really bad. I kept both pans and I'm going to see if my husband will grind smooth the rougher little pan. If he screws it up, I'l just use it as a spoon rest.

I love it’s for cooking a large brisket or a large amount of food for a family gathering. The original seasoning is good, but I decided to coat it with canola oil lightly and and toss it in the oven for one more coat of seasoning.

    Great Heavy Cast Iron

  This Lodge skillet is very heavy and will do the cooking job, whatever it might be.  I like that the skillet is versatile enough to go from the stove top into the oven.  Although it came preseasoned, I'm going to take the advice of others and reseason it myself.  I don't use anything straight out of the box without doing some cleaning.  You really don't know where the pan has been, and it's easy enough to clean it and then reseason it.  I'm looking forward to making skillet cornbread, and who knows what else.  For one person the 10"" size seems more than adequate.  It should fit a whole main course of whatever I'm cooking, with leftovers.

  I love Lodge cast iron skillets. I have this one, several smaller fry pans and their dutch oven. This skillet is quite heavy, so I recommend you consider that before purchasing it, especially if you have a glass top range. Dropping this skillet on the glass top or your foot could be disastrous.  It's not a problem if your are reasonably careful. I have a glass top, so I use both hands when handling this skillet. If you don't mind dealing with the weight, it's a great skillet. If you are new to cooking with cast iron, I recommend you also buy the Lodge brush or a comparable brush to clean the cast iron.  If you keep it well seasoned , it's very easy to clean with soapy water and a good brush.  The Lodge products come pre-seasoned, but you'll want to re-season them occasionally. Lodge includes seasoning instructions with all of their cast iron products. Those instructions are also available on the Lodge website and I recommend you check out that website if you are going to invest in any Lodge products.

  I love cooking in a cast-iron skillet. Food comes out amazing and it is really much easier to deal with than my Circulon set.I would note a few things about this particular skillet.1. The silicon handle is a nice addition.2. It is BIG. I might have gotten the smaller size if I realized it but I think the better way to go is to get this one and a smaller size. The largest size can be a bit to handle, especially if you are going from stove top to oven.3. The pre-season was probably fine, but I went ahead and did my own seasoning. I also use

    Glass Top Range Iron Skillet Works Great USA Made
  
",5.0,Classic,"Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2011","









  
  
    
  The Number one reason I ordered this brand is because it's made in America. I wanted a pan that was made in America because you never know what metals are used in those imported products. If you hear reports about lead in toys, I could only imagine what you'll find in a solid iron product, which is the reason I can't understand why some of the famous chef products are not made in the USA.I was worried about using this on my Glass Top range because I was afraid that it may crack the top of it but I worried for no reason. This is one of the best pans to use if you have a glass top stove simply because it holds the heat and cooks evenly.When I received the pan, I washed it thoroughly using regular dish washing liquid and then dried it. I then cooked some bacon in a separate pan, drained the grease and placed in the refrigerator. Once the grease was a lard consistency, I smeared a thin even coat of bacon grease fat all over the pan. I then placed the pan out on the gas grill for an hour at 550 Degrees. Some of that baked on bacon grease will flake off but it keeps the pan smooth. Whenever I use the pan, I'll either wash in soapy water or I'll fill the pan with water and boil it on the stove. After I clean the pan, I wipe the inside down with vegetable or canola oil to season and keep from rusting.This is one of the best pans to use if you're cooking hamburgers or searing steaks.

  The first thing that I would recommend doing with this cast-iron skillet is to remove the pre-seasoning and re-season this skillet at least 3 to 4 times before using. Once you have a proper seasoning on this skillet it is unstoppable. I have cooked so many different dishes inside of this cast-iron skillet including desserts. If you take care of this skillet, Meaning you cook with it, you clean it properly (no dish soap, not even a little), and re-season it after every use, it will last you a lifetime and produce some of the best food you have ever eaten.

    Chef's skillet
  
",5.0,Janine,"Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2013","









  
  
    
  Updated 12\2018: i did some research. Followed tips. Now this chef's skillet is my favorite thing. Kept using it in spite of sticking problems early on.  it now has a satin finish, and nothing ever sticks to it. My 14 yr old son cooks perfect over-easy eggs in it and it wipes clean with a paper towel.  It has been a good experience teaching him to use, clean, maintain, and most importantly, respect cast iron cookware.My advice is to keep using your cast iron skillet, especially if you don't have luck at first because you need to figure it out!  The pan isn't the problem; the cast iron knows what it's doing; the user doesn't and that's why it rusts or food sticks.Heat it slowly; I heat mine over a very VERY low heat for ten minutes. I actually used to set a timer until I got used to it; rushing it only leads to sticking. After ten minutes, I put in a nickel size amount of oil and gently slide in the eggs; after some time to set up (maybe a full minute,) I can nudge them with a spatula and they'll slide around the skillet like they're on ice. Eggs are cheap so keep practicing!  You'll master it in no time, and it's a very satisfying feeling!!!  You'll never go back to Teflon cookware once you see how much better food tastes when it is prepared in cast iron. Best of luck.

  I have used these pans for years (as did my mother before me).  I bought this one as it said it was preseasoned but my first cooking of cornbread was a disaster as the whole bottom of the cornbread stuck to the pan.  This was my second Lodge - the others were other black iron skillets.  I have seasoned others in the past and I now have this new one seasoning.  I only cook cornbread in this skillet as a majority of us older adults in the south do.  I no longer fry foods.  I guess if the next cornbread I cook after this seasoning sticks, I will have to return it and order another.

  I was pleasantly surprised at how good of a cast iron pan this is considering how affordable it is! It's the perfect size to cook two steaks or just generally a meal for two people.

  My husband likes to cook with cast iron since he was in boyscouts and it's one of those things that gets better with time. The more you cook with it, the more ""seasoned"" it gets from all the oil deposited onto the pan. It heats very evenly, even on our crappy electric range, and I've noticed when we cook things on it they tend to be fluffier and evenly cooked. It does take some adjusting if you're used to teflon non-stick cookware. And the cleanup is different. We rinse it out with water while it's still hot, giving it a light scrub with a dish scrubby then wipe it out with a damp sponge. When possible, I'd avoid soap because it just washes away the seasoning (built up oil). It has a very nice heft to it and doesn't feel cheap...if that makes sense.Another nice thing is that this is american made so you have some sense of pride in the quality of it. They do sell these at Wal-mart for about the same price as we purchased it online. So if you want to just go look at them in person you could very easily.

I have 3 other cast iron pans of varying sizes, and anyone who owns a cast iron pan that is TRULY seasoned knows, that the cooking surface is smooth, sealed, and non porous.  That’s what makes it a preferred surface to cook on.  Instead, this pan arrived with a pitted, porous cooking surface, which renders it unsuitable for that which it was purchased.  Additionally, the silicon hot handle holder is ineffective as a pot holder, when using this pan on the surface of a cooktop, or in an oven or broiler. It simply does not prevent enough of the heat from the handle of the pan from reaching your hand to make it useful.

  pan- seared a WHOLE chicken oven roaster in this skillet yesterday and what a beautiful crust it gave that bird!!! Not with any other pan EVER did I get such results. Then I transferred it to the oven, unlike before I would have to transfer into another long baking dish... the chicken would never stay intact and I would have more dirty dishes to wash!It was soooooooo delicious! We ate from it till we coldn't eat no more!I anticipate cooking in this one everyday.This skillet is very generous and I did buy the lid for it, that's another story/review..what another great peice to have after you season that big ol' lid(comes unseasoned). Helper handle is a must cause it's impossible to carry this skillet with one handle(very heavy alone so with food it weighs a ton!), be careful always to cover the handle after the iron gets hot...ouch!I gotta say I don't know how the heck I was living without cast iron. It did take me a while to get a hang of the seasoning process because even with those preseasoned peices you still really gotta season it yourself to get that non-stick and glossy surface. So after a few episodes of pooling of seasoning and  and trying out different kinds of shortenings and oils and smoke detectors going off, I finally found my own method...I hope you find yours. It's very simple though like I said once you get the hang of it, and the iron just keeps getting better and better and darker and darker. I threw all my non-stick out after all of them warped...and the crazy thing about it is that they were top-of-the-line...triple the cost of iron. I bought them from Macy's, Bloomingdale's ...expensive..make a long story short.I love this pot and with some TLC you will love it too and perhaps give it to someone you really, really,really love after 30 years or so!

  I was worried the rough surface would cause sticking, but i have found it to be a non-issue. The pre-seasoning has some issues though. Its not hard to fix, but I don't think anyone should uses these pans as is. If you wipe a clean towel across it you will notice there is a black film. This is not how cast iron cookware should be.  What you really need to do is:1) Scrub the pan thoroughly in hot soapy water with a green scrubby or steel wool to wash off any residual oil and black film2) Wipe the pan dry with a dry towel.3) Heat the pan on your stove top to warm it up and make sure its totally dry.3) Wipe a thin coat of oil all over the pan. (any cooking oil is fine)4) Wipe as much of the oil off as you can with a dry paper towel. What you want is an ultra thin coat of oil.5) Bake the pan at 400-450 degrees for at least an hour, then let the pan cool inside the oven.You should now have a well seasoned pan. If there is any black residue when you wipe it with a clean towel repeat the steps above, but it should be good to go after just one seasoning.

  It’s a solid cast iron pan.

They came right out (watch a video online if you’re not convinced...there are plenty).If anything gets a little stuck, just throw in some sat and scrub with a paper towel until it comes out. Then rinse, dry on the burner for a few minutes, then wipe down with some oil and let it sit until it’s cool again.A step more than a nonstick pan to clean, but way cheaper, healthier, and it’ll perform better a year from now rather than being ready to throw away (like every nonstick pan I’ve had, from All Clad to Calphalon to granite-stone to ceramic).

I use a Lodge nylon brush to clean with just very hot water, don’t use soap.

  I was a quite disappointed with the quality of this pan. I did not expect much from the factory seasoning, but I still tried it once on eggs, with disastrous results. I was hardly non-stick.  I stripped the entire seasoning with oven cleaner and used 100 grit sandpaper to smooth out the cooking surface and inner sides. Unfortunately, I discovered a small number of holes in the surface that would have required me to sand off too much of the surface. Due to the relatively low price and the amount of effort I had already invested, I did not return it but proceeded instead to season it with flaxseed oil (4 season cycles/oven). I am quite happy with the result but still annoyed by the presence of these imperfections in the surface. As a result, I wouldn't recommend this pan.

I repeated the same coat'n bake, and leave over night to cool. then the next thing I cooked was  peach cobbler and had no problem with sticking. The pan has a glassy coating after two treatments and two uses and does not have to be treated again. Now after rinsing with hot water (no soap) I dry it with a dish towel, rub a dab of oil around it before putting it away. Canola oil works better than olive oil for the treating because it can take the higher temp and is thinner.I can't go 5 stars because the pan is heavy...but that's the nature of cast iron...takes two hands to lift.I also have an enameled Le Creuset skillet but I like the straight sides of the Lodge better.

  I got these because I wanted to stop using Teflon and was concerned about food safety. I didn’t use them very much at first because they were very heavy and frankly didn’t really know how to season or maintain them. However, after watching some seasoning videos, I feel like I have a new hobby. There is something about creating your own seasoning on these that add a personal touch to the cook ware and make you feel good when you watch stuff come off them with little to no stick. I like making omelettes on these because it cooks the eggs slowly. I tend to leave a mess when I flip omelettes but these cook more of the egg on top with out burning the bottom. I noticed a difference with using these for making pizza crust in the oven. I clean my pan by using a non abrasive sponge, water, wiping them dry, heating them in the stove to make sure they are super dry and oiling them. Seems to work to prevent rust and keeping it non stick. A little more work than normal nonstick but some people use theirs often enough that they don’t even wash them everyday and just wipe them. Sound gross you say? But apparently heating these to 300 degrees kills all the germs.Cons: they are heavy. So maneuvering and washing these are kind of a hassle.the handle is short and get super hot which can make taking them out of the oven kind of dangerous and difficult for a small wristed person with no upper body strength. I would try carbon steel if you think this will be a big issue, but otherwise I would recommend these for someone who doesn’t might the weight and is looking for durable, Versatile, non stick cookware for a relatively cheap price who doesn’t might heating and oiling these after use.

    3.5 inch lodge pan, beware shipping packaging
  
",5.0,Paul Miller,"Reviewed in the United States November 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this mainly to use as a spoon/tongs rest while I am cooking. I suppose you could use it for cooking small singular items like an egg. If you had a bunch of them you could use them to cook single brownies (or something similar) and serve them warm right in them. The shipping packaging was not good. I was lucky it wasn't broken when I got it. Absolutely no padding in the box. It's unfortunate that I see this a lot with cast iron shipping, which is why I don't mail order cast iron often. I included photos of the box and a pic of it on my stove while cooking for size comparison.

  A plastic Lodge scraper and a stainless scrub pad is all you need to keep it clean. Never use soap. I just restored my older pans that were in storage for 3 years, and bit rusty, with the SS scrub pad, and then baked them in the oven per Lodge's instructions, except  I used coconut oil instead of olive. They looked pretty much perfect after a quick scrub - again, no soap - but I did the baking thing anyway. Some food sticks a bit, but is so easily cleaned off. Did is mention to never use soap?Heating is very even, except with the square pancake pan where the corners don't get hot enough to evenly cook your pancakes. I use the larger fry pan for pancakes now. If you want to save a little gas or electricity, turn the burner off about a minute or 2 before your food is done. There is so much residual heat in these heavy pans that food will finish cooking.Unlike ""non-stick"" cookware, you will never need to baby these. And, ladies, given how heavy and indestructible they are, they may prove useful for getting hubby's and teenager's undivided attention.

  The 6.25"" (6.25"" diameter top, 5"" diameter bottom) skillet has got to be the most adorable, cutest skillet ever. I call it ""baby skillet."" It is so small, though, this size is appropriate for only an individual meal. I can't see the skillet even being big enough to cook half-size slices of bacon. I will buy the 9"" skillet. I already have (and love) several Lodge cast iron skillets and dutch ovens. Lodge products distribute heat evenly, and are very easy to clean. I saw a reviewer say the Lodge skillet she got is hard to clean and, frankly, I have no idea what that person is talking about -- sounds like a smear against Lodge (which leads the industry in quality).

  I have two other cast iron skillets that have each lasted for over forty years.  This one did not even last for four uses.  I buffed out the bottom to make it smoother, then seasoned it in the oven.  Fried bacon it in twice and and fried some potato slices in the bacon grease immediately after the second time.  While pouring out the excess bacon grease I noticed that the the side had cracked about half way down from the rim.  The pan had never been subjected to high heat, never been put on a fire empty, never had cold water put on it while it was even warm, let alone hot.  It was just defective and I can only be thankful that it was not the cause of a fire on my stove top.

  I was a little surprised how large this skillet was, but I’m very pleased. It came very well seasoned. I rubbed some Crisco all over it and put it in the oven. Later in the day, I prepared a vegetable medley and cooked it in the oven in this skillet. It turned out great, of course. Typical of a Lodge product, this is a very sturdy, dense piece of iron. You will likely need to use the added handle to lift and move it. Because of its size, the skillet overhangs most burners. Still, it does a great job on bacon and I just made some fried rice in it last night. Pretty amazing. I recommend this skillet.

  This review is for the 3.5 inch cast iron ""skillet"" (since Amazon is currently grouping multiple sizes of Lodge cast iron skillets in the same review group).  The thing is TINY, but then again it says 3.5 inch quite clearly.  I use mine for melting butter/serving melted butter and it does the job well and with a certain refined rustic style that only comes from cast iron cookware.  It is a quality item, like most Lodge cast iron, and made in the USA like so few things are these days, but it does have limited use potential due to its small size.  My only complaint is that the cooking surface is rather rough, downright bumpy even, and would have been better had they sanded and smoothed the surface down a bit before finishing.  Otherwise I love it.

    Really fine skillets
  
",5.0,Steve,"Reviewed in the United States April 15, 2014","









  
  
    
  I have a 12"", 16"" skillets, a 10"" flat frying pan and a rectangular griddle, all Lodge.  I also have a 12"" skillet by another mfg. I have had for at least thirty years,  It took a few years to become perfectly seasoned but I still prefer my Lodge.  After just a few weeks they are superbly seasoned.  I ordered a 9"" skillet just a few minute ago primarily for making gravies. I'm writing this review because I just read some of the negative reviews and found some based on people not knowing how to cook with cast iron and others due to not understanding the nature of cast iron. As far as learning to cook with it goes, it just takes a bit of practice while paying attention to how things cook in cast iron.  It is not rocket science so if you patiently stay with it, you will learn to love it.  Nothing cooks as well, heats as evenly or browns as well. As far as pots go, I prefer the enamel coated cast iron - a la La Cruset.  The Chinese make these at a fraction of the cost and they are fine.  The Chinese haven't got the steel making thing down but their cast iron seems quite adequate.  Another complaint involves cracks and breakage.  Cast iron is a bit fragile compared to other metals so if you receive a cracked one, just replace it. It is just the nature of the beast.  Personally, I've never had this problem.  Sticking - these are not non stick pans in the teflon sense but I find they stick less than other non non stick pans.  Sometimes, things are going to stick,  When that happens, I just put a couple of inches of water in the pan and put it to boil for a few minutes and whatever is stuck releases making clean up a breeze.  When I fry eggs, I use non stick spray (after the skillet is hot) and then add some butter before adding the eggs and they slide around just like they would on teflon.My other cookware is All Clad and though enormously more expensive, I still prefer the cast iron for frying.  Even though Lodge says they are non stick right out of the box or nearly so, I find it improves with use.  If you look at reviews of various brands and types of cookware on cooking related sites, you will find cast iron ranks at or very near the top.  Cast iron cookware gets passed down generations and I've never heard of any other cookware rating that - except perhaps biscuit pans which somehow gain mystical reputations.  Cast iron does cook a good biscuit by the way.I hope this helps with your decision.  It is inexpensive so just give it a go.  If you don't like it, you can always use it to hit people or hold a door open - it is a bit heavy.

  There are different choices but Lodge is the overall my top pick and worth the price. The pans are made in the USA so you know there isn't any filler toxic metals which you may find in other brands not made in the USA. Plus this is a hefty pan. Other cheaper brands tend to use less materials which do not hold heat as well. I use chain mail cast iron scrubber and do not use soap to ensure the seasoning doesn't get stripped. If I were to have any criticism, the 13.25 skillet is very heavy and your grandma may need assistance if she wanted to pick it up.

  I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this cast iron frying pan for this price.  I cleaned with cast iron cleaner and dried thoroughly.  Then I seasoned it three times, letting it cool down completely each time.  The first cornbread I made slid right out beautifully, no problem. The pan already has a dark patina from the seasoning and that will continue to improve as time goes on.  I bought this pan primarily for baking cornbread because you can't beat cast iron for that.  Lodge pans are high quality and they are known to outlast their owners and get passed down from generation to generation.

  Bought this as a test of cast iron pans. Was really amazed at how hot this pan gets and how it retains the heat. Brought this on my first camping trip and was perfect for over camp fire or on a propane stove. I love cooking bacon and steak on this pan compared to my other nonstick pans. When camping I used a crumbled up piece of aluminum foil to use to scrub this with salt. This pan is so hot that it just burns everything to crisp and then just scrubs off easily. What was annoying that I was not used to is the fact that I had to make sure to heat the pan after cleaning every time to make sure all the water evaporated to prevent from rusting. After doing this often, it's a good habit to clean the pan after cooking instead of letting it sit anyways. Most times at home, I don't even rinse the pan. I just scrub the food scraps off and leave it to use the next day.

  I never used a cast iron pan before but I had a couple of recipes I wanted to try that required one. Taking the pan out of the box I wondered if I had made a mistake because it is so different from other types of pans I'm used to. Even though the pan is well seasoned at the factory I followed the directions for seasoning myself and then promptly used it. Wow, It's great. I not only used it to make the baby dutch pancakes and cornbread I got it for but now I'm using for many other things too. If you eat meat there is no better way to cook a steak than to sear it in this pan and finish the cooking in a preheated oven. Cleaning it is easy as the seasoning really makes it a non-stick pan. The handle actually works well with the pan even though it looks too short.

  This is my first cast-iron pan. I was always scared of using cast iron because I grew up on consumer-grade pans with non-stick coatings and lightweight metals. Those lesser quality pans always seem to degrade quickly however. The non-stick coating wears off, the pans buckle and warp, and I end up throwing them away and buying another, rinse and repeat ad nauseum.The Lodge pan is solid, and heavy. I did my due diligence and read up on how to use and care for a iron pan, and to be honest, it is no worse than taking care of any other pan. It cleans up super easily, and after a few uses, it has proven to be just about as non-stick as any of my non-stick pans, but cooks better, more evenly, browns nicely, and cleanup is a breeze. I clean it like any other pan, with some mild dish soap and a plastic scrub, dry it, then apply a very light coat of oil before storing it. That's it. No magic. It just works, and it is such a joy to cook on. If you've been shying away from getting a good cast iron pan, I wholeheartedly recommend this one as a good starter. This will cover most of your daily cooking needs.

    For the price, it's hard to beat Lodge cast iron skillets
  
",4.0,🔹 Catrinka 🔹,"Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2016","









  
  
    
  I've ordered two of these 12"" Lodge cast iron skillets from Amazon over the years.  The first one I bought years ago for me to use and, more recently, another one for my son's first apartment after college.For the price, I don't think you can beat cast iron skillets from Lodge.  If you google ""best cast iron cookware,"" you'll generally find Lodge listed at the top or at least as one of the favorites by different consumer research sites and publications such as Cooks Illustrated even when compared to cast iron at many times the price.The only cast iron cookware that I find to be of better quality than these are those manufactured many decades earlier.  I have a couple of smaller Griswold cast iron skillets made around 1930-1940 and there's a definite difference.  Good quality vintage cast iron cookware is generally thinner walled and slightly lighter in weight.  Many of the older pieces also have a raised bottom ridge, or smoke ring.  However, the biggest difference IMO is the smooth, polished surface on the vintage pieces.  Modern-day manufacturing of cast iron skillets (like these by Lodge) tends to leave a slightly pebbled surface.  Unfortunately, it's getting harder and harder to find smooth-finish vintage cast iron cookware that's in good condition.  And, when you do, it's usually quite expensive.An ultra-hot cast iron skillet is my very favorite for searing thick tenderloin steaks and salmon.  I put the skillet (minus silicone holder) into a 500° oven for about 10 minutes to heat it.  Then I apply a dry rub seasoning to both sides of room temp steak filets or to top side of salmon fillets.  Remove hot skillet from oven (extremely hot, so be careful), place on high flame or burner, and immediately place steaks or salmon onto skillet surface to sear to the degree of browning and crispness desired (usually just takes 1-3 minutes).  Flip to other side to sear and then place back into still-hot oven to finish cooking.  Amount of time in oven will depend on thickness of steak and/or fish and degree of ""done-ness.""  Salmon and other meaty fish don't take long and, since we eat our steaks rare or med-rare, it usually doesn't take more than several minutes in the hot oven to finish.While the pre-seasoning on these skillets (Lodge uses soy-based vegetable oil) is a nice way to start out without having to do that time-consuming step before using, you'll find that the surface of your skillet just keeps getting better and better.  For many things, I find them to be every bit as non-stick as a teflon coating.For cleaning, I use a scraper if I need to remove anything stuck on, but rarely does that happen.  I never use detergent on mine.  Instead I use hot water and a scrubbie to clean.  Always be sure to thoroughly dry cast iron pieces so that no rust develops.  And never ever put them in the dishwasher!The silicone handle cover is a nice addition for use on top of the stove.  While it can handle some oven temperatures, I remove it before placing in a 500° oven since that's higher than the recommended temp for the silicone.

It wasn't years of seasoning right out of the box but it got you started. I made some skillet potatoes in it the first weekend I had it. They did stick a bit more than I expected but not horrible. I made a few other dishes and then decided to season it myself to see if it made a huge difference. It did. I seasoned it as I usually do with my cast iron and this thing it's awesome. So all in all, you can use it out of the box but you'll be happier if you season it yourself.

  I use it on a glass cooktop. I don’t like glass cooktops and wondered if it would work. But it does. The pan is primed already but I primed it some more with oil in a warm oven. Don’t use soap or only a teeny amount of soap. It becomes more and more seasoned with use. It was so inexpensive. Our burgers and steak come out with nice sear.  Recommend.

  I used this skillet the same day I received it and the meat I was cooking on it burned badly. The smoke filled the entire house and it was such weird smell that even my dogs went downstairs to hide. I put the skillet aside in my new sink so it can cool down and cleaned all the mess. After several hours I wanted to clean the skillet and when I lifted it, I noticed how badly the bottom of my sink was rusted! The skillet was rusted too, and so hard to clean. My sink even now is not perfectly clean again, even though I used a scrub, brushes, and different cleaning supplies to make it look all nice and shiny again. I threw away the skillet because it was all orange and the burnt food wouldn't come off anyway. I'm really disappointed.

  I was hesitant to buy a cast iron skillet as I have never owned one before, but after two nonstick skillets died back to back, I figured I would try something new. I am so ecstatic with this skillet that I'm going to have to tell everyone that they should have one!! Seriously though, it sears a steak PERFECTLY, we've made delicious eggs both fried and scrambled, and it makes a beautiful, melty grilled cheese. I'm so excited to try cooking different things with this because the flavor is so great and it heats so evenly. I was nervous about what clean up would entail but after doing some quick research its no big deal. Very happy with this purchase, I look forward to cooking many different meals with this.

  My wife originally bought a ""value"" cast iron pan. She season and seasoned it. After months of complaining, someone finally mentioned that Chinese made cast iron pans are not of the the same quality as American made pans. We bought this pan and with one attempt at seasoning, she was able to cook eggs without them sticking to the pan. She was delighted. In the long run, it would have been less expensive to buy a quality American made product that works than to buy a ""low-cost"" product that doesn't.

I contacted Lodge through their website, but haven't heard back yet, which is disappointing. I still used it to cook corn tortillas the other day, since there was no liquid that would leak out, but I'm sure the huge crack down the middle it impacting the heating.

  I went years without buying a cast iron pan because I was scared they were too complicated and difficult to use and clean. I was so wrong. I don't cook very often, but when I do, I reach for this pan. This pan actually heats up properly and evenly and cooks my food super fast. I actually can't stand using cheaper pans from Target now. I didn't season the pan when I received it so I feel like the first few times I used it, there was quite a bit of sticking and burning of food. However, after using it over a dozen times now, there is very little sticking. I think I finally built a natural seasoning.Cleaning this pan is also super easy. I bought a cast iron scrubber and only use that after I'm done cooking. I wipe it down with a cloth, oil it with olive oil, and stick it back in the cabinet. Looks beautiful and ready for use every single time.I wish I would've purchased one sooner!

  I have a couple of the pre-seasoned Lodge pans. The pre-seasoning really makes a difference. With a couple of years use I expect the pans surface to approach the smoothness of a decades-old skillet of mine, from the decent level of smoothness after a few months use.This particular skillet is heavy, almost more than what I can manage with one hand, which is why the 2nd handle is there and 1 star is missing. My girlfriend finds it too heavy. But it's great for cooking up the mound of vegetables - onions, carrots, spinach, brussels sprouts, squash, etc, that I like to have with breakfast.I've gotten rid of almost all my non-stick and aluminum pans because I'm concerned about their long-term health effects. But who can't use a little iron in their diet?

  I have owned one of these pans for 5 years. It takes a little getting used to the differences in care between non-stick and cast iron. In the end you will never need another pan. It requires extra heating/cooling time, a little extra oil, a little extra elbow grease, and bigger muscles to move it around. It will last your entire life with a some extra care, but you never have to worry about the harmful chemical surface flecking off and leeching into your food. Plus the more you use it the better it gets. You can't hurt it with a metal utensil, and the heat stays in it for searing and simmering.I got my son the 9"" pan a few years ago, and the only thing he does not like about it is the smaller size. So I got him the 12"" skillet and he loves it. One of my friends saw and also bought one.In a time when cheap, short-lived non-stick pans are plentiful, and high quality stainless steel requires a loan, Lodge cast iron skillets are a great alternative. I trust them to be made from reliable iron, and they are only a few dollars more than imported versions that I feel may not have trustworthy materials. (why do they all smell like diesel fuel?)

  I actually bought this as a protest after trying out a set of ceramic pans. I needed a 10 inch every day nonstick pan and was tired of Teflon type pans. Although it came seasoned already, I let it sit out and stuck it in my oven with oil a couple of times a day for several days. Whenever I was loading or unloading the dishwasher or general cleaning. After all that seasoning along with using it for my go to pan, it now performs as well as any non stick pan I have owned. Eggs slide right out as well as they do in my 12 inch Calphalon and the size is better for me.  Only con is the weight and the need o dry on a burner and re-oil after use. Big plus is, it's a Lodge.

  I own a smaller cast iron skillet (10.25) and needed something bigger. The 13.25” skillet came today. Not happy that an 11.7lbs cast iron skillet was placed in a square box without packing materials to hold it in place somewhat anyway. You can see in one pic the handle broke open the box and was sticking out. It is a little scratched, but I think it will be fine. When I opened the box I was very surprised at how huge 13.25” is for a skillet...and to think I was looking at the 15” skillet to buy. Thank you to the few reviewers that stated this is a BIG skillet and it really is bigger than you are thinking. I’ve cooked in cast iron most if my life and I love the ease of clean up, being able to cook on the stove and move it to the oven but must of all, the even cooking it provides since cast iron heats so perfectly even. I will admit, it is heavy and as I get older, it is tougher for me to move/carry with one hand, but I make sure I buy the products that have a helper handle and all is well. Lodge products usually have the helper handle so I look for them first when I’m in the market.

I figured it must be the skillet, so I removed it and sure enough - the bottom of the skillet was starting to MELT on the rack inside my oven! I didn’t even know that was possible. It dripped liquid cast iron onto the bottom floor of my oven, where it hardened. My oven now smells like chemicals every time I use it. So yeah.

  I bought the 10.25 inch pan on 5/15/2019 and it’s 11/27 today. I’ve never owned cast iron before, wasn’t too sure it it was worth all the trouble people made it sound like. But I love very crispy breakfast potatoes, and I’ve destroyed non-stick and ceramic pans because of it, and everything just sticks to stainless steel horribly. So I tried this and I’m glad I did. The best trick I can tell you is, start with low heat, and stay there. Just accept it’s going to take a while to cook. I have a gas stove and medium is too high to cook with this thing, food always gets burnt, but medium-low is perfect. And don’t wash it. I use it at least once a week and all I ever do is pour a little more oil in after the food is done, leave it over the hot burner, wipe out the oil and food bits into the trash when it’s cool, wipe with more oil if there’s still food bits left, and store it in the oven so it doesn’t get dusty. That’s it. It’s been great. The only time I use water and soap on it is if it gets gross and sticky (you’ll know when) and don’t scrub it that much, make sure it’s completely dry with paper towels, reheat it with oil, cool and wipe again with oil, and store it with more dry paper towels. Oh and I bought a bunch of stuff with this that I thought I needed to take care of it (cast iron plastic scrappers, chain mail scrubber, silicone gloves) you don’t need any of it. The chain mail was kind of cool but I’ve used it maybe 3 times. And two regular cloth pot holders are enough to touch the handle.

  This skillet is perfect. For so many types of cooking and baking. Sorry I waited so long to get it. When I recently was gifted a nice cookbook for cast iron skillets, I pulled my old no-name skillet out of the back corner of my cabinets. It worked OK, but heated very unevenly. I then noticed that it wobbled around on my stove. The bottom was not perfectly flat. This Lodge skillet is perfectly flat on the bottom, heats evenly, and holds a lot of food. Get a cast iron cookbook, start cooking your way through it, and you just might throw away your teflon coated non-stick pans.

  It's pre-seasoned so it worked well right out of the box and has only gotten better over time. I use it mostly for frying things: eggs and small side dishes. I don't know how it performs if you try to use it in the oven to bake cornbread or whatever, but I'm sure it's fine for that if its properly oiled. The 8-inch size is not very large, a bit wider than the burner on my stove, but it can fry 2-3 eggs at the same time comfortably. I had imagined it being slightly bigger, but that's my fault for not getting out the tape measure. Due to the smaller size/weight (ease of control), it would also make a great makeshift cudgel should I be attacked by intruders in my own kitchen.

  Learn to turn the heat down, it holds heat beautifully and cooks great. Stove top to brown meat and finish it off in the oven. I own the Lodge Enamel Grill, this size skillet and a larger one. Once you get a good season on your pans and learn to cook at lower temperatures you can cook just about anything. The only thing I tend not to cook in these are things with high acid, like tomato based, lemon based foods, they are hard on your seasoning. Fry fish, scramble eggs, you have to use butter, grease of some sort. Meat, let it brown (also when frying potatoes) well on one side before turning. People move stuff around the pan too quick and things stick, also if you don't have a good seasoning. These can last 100 years if taken care of properly. Once you learn all the things you can make with cast iron, (check out this cook book; ( https://www.amazon.com/Southern-Cast-Iron-Cookbook-Comforting/dp/1939754089/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=cast+iron+cook+book&qid=1547855010&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1 )you will always want to have one.

  but it has proven quite challenging to clean, and the time it takes to build up a nice layer of seasoning which can make it non-stick is taking months and months of consistent use and painstaking cleaning (this is standard for most skillets, but especially here because of the so-so job Lodge did at providing a pre-season).I recommend skillet cooking to everyone, but keep in mind it takes a tremendous amount of effort to maintain (tremendous compared to other types of pans / cook trays).It makes superb steaks though. If you don't have an open-flame grill, skillets are the way to go. Meats, veggies, cakes, cookies, anything under the sun will taste exquisitely non-metallic with a good, well-seasoned skillet.

  I like that the pan came seasoned. However, I did end up seasoning the pan in the oven to add a few more layers.  It took me some time to figure out the correct temperature and preheating time for the pan when cooking different foods. The cooking surface gets better with more usage. I can now cook eggs and pancakes without them sticking to the pan. My favorite food to cook using this pan is steak. The steak develops a delicious crust while remaining tender and juicy on the inside. Burgers and pizza also taste delicious when cooked in this pan. Most of the time I only need to wipe out the pan with a paper towel in order to clean it. For times when that is not enough, I rub the inside of the pan with coarse salt to remove any food residue. On rare occasions, I will use a drop of mild dish soap with a soft sponge. I then rinse the pan with water and dry it with a dish cloth or paper towel. After that, I heat the pan on the stove for a couple of minutes and rub it with a very thin layer of oil. Once the pan starts smoking, I turn off the heat and let it cool down. I have not had any issues with the pan rusting by following the aforementioned steps.

  I was very excited to get my first cast iron skillet.  I immediately made a egg frittata.  The egg stuck to the entire surface.  What have I done wrong?  I had the impression the pre-seasoned would equate to a non-stick surface.  Do I still need to add some oil to the pan to prevent sticking?  I cleaned it using a pan scraper.  Then I coated the pan with a fine covering of vegetable oil and let it burn off on the stove.  What else should I be doing OR not doing?I rated the over-all rating low cuz it forced me to in order to ask a question.

    Chef Skillet Catharsis

  I know there's a gazillion reviews already, but having used Lodge cast iron cookware a gazillion times, I can't resist weighing in. If you're newly getting into cast iron, read a bunch of the negative reviews first ... and discover people who are truly (often innocently) clueless about the preparation, care and usage of timeless cast iron cookware.I have a bunch of Lodge skillets, a griddle, two Dutch ovens and a pot with a self-basting lid which happens to also fit one of my skillets as well as my new chef's skillet. I really wanted a skillet with rounded sides, mostly for an egg and omelette pan. At $15, the LCS3 is a steal, considering I can neither find nor afford vintage Griswold.Like all Lodge, it comes pre-seasoned, which simply means it has a coating of oil that prevents oxidation. This seasoning is not what makes it non-stick. How you cook with it does. Out of the box, I enjoyed the cathartic ritual of baking four more coats of oil onto the seasoning which turned it a lovely, shiny black. Then, I pressed it into service as a non-stick wonder.Some people complain about the ""pebbly"" texture of the pan, some even testifying that this is the reason food sticks ... wrong. Proper temperature and proper amounts of fats are the keys to cooking non-stick. The ""pebbly"" texture means nothing. Besides, with continued use, the ""pebbly"" texture will turn into a smooth-as-silk surface. All my Lodge has been used enough to reach this point (except, of course, this brand new piece.)There are a lot of great videos on Youtube that can teach you how to cook with and care for your cast iron, but I can sum it up in a jiffy. Always preheat your cast iron over medium / low heat first, until it lightly smokes. Lower the heat slightly. Add butter, oil or other fats that are room temperature or cold. Coat the bottom and sides. Add your food and watch it slide around. When finished, rinse with hot water; if you have fond in the pan, scrape with a nylon scraper and rinse away. Dry the cast iron on the stove top burner and then wipe down with a very light coating of oil. You're ready for the next use. (This coating will lightly smoke when it reaches proper temperature, indicating when to add your cooking fats.)Other than the initial wash-down out of the box, I personally do not use soap on my cast iron. Some people do. Avoid cooking with acidic foods and liquids like tomatoes or vinegars or you'll surely be re-seasoning your pan before you know it. Good luck, and good cooking. And remember the chef's maxim: ""Hot pan, cold fat.""

  Cast iron skillets are a joy. The price of this one was a pleasant surprise.  Better ones have a polished cooking surface but cost way more.  Excellent for occasional use. And more nonstick than T-Val, silverstone, Teflon or supposedly ceramic coated skillets.  Like all cast-iron skillets, it is much heavier than common ones and a bit unwieldy - the very young or very old may find it too weighty.  Not quite as good as my mothers inherited ones But better than ordinary skillets and less costly by far than Moms. (That brand is still made, more than a century later, but is not cheap.

The pre seasoning from Lodge worked really well for me.I was initially concerned about getting a quick start and getting the skillet up to temperature and cooking quickly in the morning because it's so heavy, but this actually seems to get up to working temp faster than my aluminum pans, I also found that I needed to lower my normal cooking temperatures, this thing conducts heat really well.I have averaged a skillet a year with teflon and ceramic coated aluminum and they just plain don't last even if I spend three times the amount I spent on this skillet no matter how careful I clean them. Everyone says cast iron lasts darn near forever and I really look forward to not having to throw this one away.This is heavy, heavy enough so that it's a little strain moving it around.Complicating the matter is the handle they provide in this combo isn't the right size for the skillet, it's quite a bit longer than the handle which results in a weird limp overhang. It works but it could be much better.

  Love my new pan. I use it for making omelets and frying meat mostly. Easy to use right out of the package. The factory seasoning was enough to cook an omelet with no sticking. I cook in butter and just wipe it out with a slightly moist sponge when done - ready for the next meal! The only complaint is the WEIGHT - these pans are heavy! And when you're done cooking and you have a super heavy hunk of burning iron to move to the sink/clean, it's not fun. Also, avoid buying the Lodge silicon handle heat protector - it's too big and only protects you from the heat for a few seconds (enough to move it to another burner, but not enough to move it to the sink and clean it while still holding it).

  I own a 8"", 10.25"", 13.25"", and a 15"" Lodge cast iron skillet. For years I've used the 10.25"" and then bought the 8"" and 15"". I love cooking in quantity for leftovers and for big parties. So I decided to pick up the 15"". I love the size of the cooking area of the 15"" but it is massive and takes forever to heat up. I tried numerous times to heat up slowly on low-med/low and then after a good amount of time I would turn up the heat and start cooking. I noticed that the center of the pan would be smoking hot while the edges would be significantly cooler and it would instead steam my food vs. searing it. My burner is not wide enough to cover the bottom of the pan and that resulted in me returning the pan. I think the best way to preheat the 15"" is in the oven but there is no way I would do that every time I wanted to use this pan so I decided to return it. For the longest time I was deciding what to replace it with, either the 12"" vs. the 13.25"". I considered my burner size and I knew the 12"" would work but I also wanted the biggest sized pan without the issues I was having with my 15"". I think the 13.25"" you gain an inch of cooking area and the sides are 1/4"" higher when compared to the 12"". So if these things are important to you than the 13.25"" would be the one for you. The edges on the 13.25"" still run slightly cooler than the center but it is not significant enough for it to affect how I cook. But overall, comparing price and the differences of the 13.25"" over the 12"", I would say the 12"" would be the pan to get for most users. So would I return the 13.25"" and trade for the 12""? I would say no b/c the little bit of extra cooking room and slightly higher sides are important to me. I hope this review helps those that are still deciding what size of pan they should get.

  It’s my first cast iron pan so I didn’t know how to care for it fully, but I figured it out. It cannot be left to air dry or it will rust. It has to be dried of with towels, and I also spread a bit of olive oil on the surface of the pan after I dry it off to help prevent rusting. It’s heavy and awkward but it cooks pretty well, especially meat. Needs a bit of time to heat up completely, but I use it a lot to fry up chicken or turkey bacon. I wish I knew what I was getting into before I bought it, but now that I know how to take care of it, I’m starting to appreciate it so much more than the non stick skillet I have.

    Lodge 8 Inch Cast Iron Skillet replaces non-stick skillet to cook eggs

  I wanted a replacement for a 8"" non-stick pan that no longer non-stick.  I have several other pieces of Lodge cast iron cookware so I decided that this would be a good replacement.  The Lodge skillet is pre-seasoned and preforms well from the start.  I cook120 grams of egg whites in this pan every morning.  When I first began using the cast iron pan the eggs would stick around the edge of the pan but after using for several weeks there is much less egg stuck in the pan.When I cook my eggs I add vegetable oil and preheat the pan over medium heat.  I then add the eggs and begin to stir the eggs the entire amount is cooked in less than 30 seconds and then remove from the pan.What I do is after cooking the eggs allow the pan to cool and any stuck on egg will release from the pan.  After the pan has cooled wash with water and use a plastic dish scrubber to clean the inside.  Dry the pan and lightly coat the inside with vegetable oil.I have used this skillet daily for about 2 months and the seasoning has greatly improved.

  We are trying to get away from the teflon pans currently in use. This skillet is very well made. We use it on a flat top stove and it stays put - unlike teflon pans. It does take a bit longer to heat up, but when it is heated the heat is very evenly distributed. Clean up is not as easy as a teflon pan, but so far it is easier than I anticipated. After cleaning the skillet we rub it down with some coconut oil of olive oil and store it covered with wax paper.We like it enough to buy a smaller diameter skillet too.

  As other reviewers have noted with Lodge cast iron skillets this had a bit rougher texture than I might have liked out of the chute. That said I did a light cleaning and seasoning before use and found no real complaints aside from perhaps not cleaning up as well afterwards as I would have liked. But not enough to cause any real problems.As a test I took the skillet out to the shed and did some work with a file for some high peaks, followed by course sanding and steel wool on half the bottom surface. I followed this with a seasoning on the stove top. While it is easy to see that the half I worked over is smoother to the touch, it is yet to be seen how much difference it will make in the long run, but at least I can make the comparison.

  Why did I abandon my old cast irons for stainless steel, and no stick pots and pans? This Lodge cast iron skillet out preforms everything else I've owned over the years, and they were high quality brands (expensive too). Concerns for the no stick wearing off and contaminating our food motivated us to try the good old fashion cast iron. Glad we did. Better heat distribution, cooks foods evenly. A small amount of cooking oil keeps most things from sticking. The downside to cast iron cooking is having to season it with oil after washing. Also, be sure to use a pot holder or heat gloves, the handle gets awfully hot.The Lodge brand seems to be better made than others we have looked at. Finish is smoother. Lodge Manufacturing company is  the only major manufacturer of cast-iron cookware in the United States. The other cookware suppliers use pots and pans made in Asia or Europe. They tend to be courser in finish.

  This pan is incredibly well crafted!! My jaw hit the floor to see cast iron so inexpensively made in America! However. When I got it(10""), the first thing we noticed was a rougher than normal texture on the cooking surface. On the whole pan, actually! Thankfully, we have a dremel and will get to work on smoothing it down. I have zero issue with this though because of how inexpensive it was and it's Made in America. I'll sand it down, idc. But just so everyone is aware: you do not have to smooth it down. This is a personal preference. And if you do, make sure to season the whole deal all over again. Which I planned on doing anyway.The handle is so short! However, this is actually works to my advantage because I have smaller than normal hands, so it fits me like a glove but in reverse! Plus it has the other handle on the opposite side that I just LOVE.The weight of it is heavier than normal, as far as I know. Which, admittedly, isn't far at all. In fact, it's right around the corner there past ""Idk Rd"" and ""Sure Thing Boss Blvd""Overall, I have to give this pan 4/5 stars. Because of that finish. I must.

  Newbie to cast iron, take my review as such ;-)  I wanted a non-stick pan that was not Teflon, and not one I'd have to replace every few months (the organic or greenie pans).  I care about the chemicals in non-stick, and am willing to not have perfect omelets or whatever to avoid them.  In comes the great reviews on cast iron.  For $16 it was worth a try.  So far, I am LOVING this pan!!  I'm on a low fat diet so I'm not greasing it up as much as I could and even so, it is semi-nonstick.  I can make egg scrambles, cook chicken and veggies, everything, without worry of a hard caked on mess once I'm done.  Clean up is also easy, an abrasive sponge right after cooking with water, dry, then add a spray of oil and leave it for next use.  For the price this is well worth it, and I like that I won't have to throw it out like the ""organic"" non-chemical pans I have previously been purchasing.  Good buy!

  I use Cast Iron at work and finally got this one for home. I did my own additional seasoning in the oven prior to using it. It seems to be great quality and so far cooking nice and even as expected. Good price for the quality. Just remember, you have to know how to use one. You may have to learn as you go and after a little use you will be an expert. If your food doesn't turn out the way you desire the first few times, you likely just doing it wrong Give it some time, do some reading, and learn. This is a great pan.

    Great Quality US Cast Iron Skillet - VERY BIG & HEAVY
  
",5.0,George E. Goff & Better Half MicheleTop Contributor: Baking,"Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2018","









  
  
    
  Believe them when they say this is big - it is gigantic. I wanted a US made cast iron skillet to use in steak preparation that moved from the stove top searing to the final broiling and this one is excellent. It is very well made by Lodge and will last forever. I wanted a big one to accommodate all the steaks at once and this certainly does. Even with the second handle, this pan is a challenge to move around and you should be very careful if using it on a glass top stove - pick the pan up to move it - DO NOT SLIDE IT - or you may damage your range. It is very heavy and I may have been just as happy with a smaller pan, but it is here now and I certainly won't be in need of buying another for many years to come.

  Although it claims to come pre-seasoned, it's pretty clear that it isn't enough to keep your food from sticking horribly to the bottom of the pan. I followed a guide online about how to properly season a pan, and I haven't had any issues since. I recommend everyone do that prior to using it. It feels to be pretty standard cast iron, and hopefully lasts a long time, but I was very unimpressed with how rough it was and the lack of proper seasoning.

  I love this thing! I'm a recent convert to cast iron cooking. As everyone said if you don't over clean it and just cook crap off it before you use it they work well and non-stick. I'm really impressed with how much better the food tastes. Shocked really. All my cooking is now cast iron. Somebody needs to make a cast iron Foreman style grill! I'll buy that in a second.Anyway, weighs a ton like it should. Cooks great. The rubber pad thing is helpful but collects grease inside so wash that out a lot. Don't wash the pan a lot though. Just heat and spatula scraping and it is more non-stick than the non stick pans they sell.

  Kinda disappointed as when I got the skillet I was so happy to try it out. It cooks great and is well made. It has started to rust about a month ago ( 4-15-2020 ) on the bottom and have had to re season twice since I got it in Feb. 2020. I do not use water to wash it. I use kosher salt. I would love to buy the 13"" skillet but it is 3 times as much, for 3"" more. Worried about it rusting also. My 10"" needs to be seasoned again ( 5-22-2020 ) I've had cast iron skillets in the past and never had any rust. In fact I have one now that is over 30 years old and has never had rust on it. Tried putting pictures up but don't know if they stayed. I can not recommend this product unless they can stop the rust.

  This is my third lodge skillet. I typically use my 12 inch for everything, but I live alone, and this is perfect for eggs or grilled cheese. My biggest tip that I can give for lodge preseasoned cast iron---""wash it"" first. I don't use soap, but I use a stainless steel scrubber and hot water and thoroughly scrub the whole thing inside and out. I then dry it over medium heat on the stove, put a thin layer of oil all over the pan with a paper towel and then ""bake"" the cast iron in the oven at 450 degrees until it starts to smoke and stink. It kind of smells chemically. Once I smell it, I turn the stove off, let the cast iron cool in the oven, take it out, and it's ready to use. It may take a couple times before it's perfectly nonstick. Between each use I scrub it with the stainless steel scrubber and hot water and dry over medium heat on the stove. I rub more oil on it after drying about every 10th time I use it, or when it looks dry. I have never had to rebake it. My twelve inch has been perfect for years and this one is well on its way. So low maintenance. Great, heavy quality.

    American Made - High Quality Cast Iron - for same price as Chinese no-name pans
  
",5.0,R J,"Reviewed in the United States November 20, 2018","









  
  
    
  First of all, these cast iron pans are extremely versatile and durable for cooking.  Second of all, you don't have to worry about any PFOA or other types of coatings coming off in your food and you ingesting them in some way.  Third. cast iron cooks extremely evenly, and does an amazing job in browning all type of foods.Personally, I use it for cooking sliced fingerling potatoes in olive oil.  The 10.25 size allows for more than enough potatoes, and doesn't require you to use a bunch of expensive olive oil to coat the bottom of the pan for frying.  If you buy the pan, you'll have to try this -- the potatoes are easy to make and absolutely delicious.  Also, for the issue of splatter - I've found that my Swiss Diamond glass lid fits pretty good - not perfect, but since I already have it, and I don't need to store yet ANOTHER lid, I highly recommend using another glass pan lid if you have one rather than having to buy a new one.  I also purchased the Lodge silicone handle, at only five bucks - it makes dealing with these hot handles much easier and at that price, I highly recommend it.Finally, you have to love that this is a 100 + year old legendary American made and owned brand.  The fact that you can buy this at the same price as some no-name Chinese pan is a huge bonus, and you really have no excuse not to buy the Lodge.Enjoy!

Now that that I have this one I am kicking myself for not getting it earlier. It's really inexpensive too so don't waste your money trying to save $5 on the crappy Chinese knock off junk.

  This is my first cast iron skillet and I was worried about it rusting.  But after some research online I'm slowly getting a better understanding on how to use and care for this type of pan.  When it first arrive, I lightly cleaned the pan to wash away any residue from shipping (the box was very beaten up when it arrived).  The first thing I cooked was a fried egg and it did stick a little to the pan.  The key is to wait until the pan is hot before adding the oil and then the egg.  Depending on your stove type you'll need to figure out the strength of your fire (if a gas stove) or the heat on an electric stove.  The advice I found online said the skillet hasn't developed it's non stick surface yet.  So I made a few more fried eggs later in the week and it started to improve.  Each time I used the pan, I cleaned it right away with hot water and very minimal dish soap.  Then I placed the pan on the stove to dry off.  If the surface looked dull, I added a coating of oil.  A week later I cooked some bacon and that helped season the pan a bit more.  Today I made some fried chicken and after cleaning the pan of excess oil, my skillet is looking to be taking on a good surface.  It's not greasy or sticky.  I know eventually I'll get to sauté some vegetables, pan fry tofu, or make a few pieces of french toast without them sticking to the bottom.

  This is my first piece of cast iron.  It came packaged nicely when expected.  Although I haven't used it much I must say it is good quality.  The very first time I used it I was frying chicken, our fire alarm went off, and we had to leave the building for about 15 minutes.  I took the chicken out of the pan and turned the burner off.  When I came back in I turned the burner on and continued to fry the chicken.  Best fried chicken in town!  I'm tempted to use my cast iron to fry chicken like this all the time.  Because I purchased the Lodge Scrub Brush also, the clean up was not too difficult .  After reading some other reviews from pro-cast iron users, I will take their tips.

  Aside from two small 1/4"" areas of finish (pictured) on the edge which I was unsure if just color difference or finish potential problem, these are great. Those spots haven't caused any issues.Cast iron pans really are not for people who tend to set dirty pans in the sink over night full of water. Don't do that then complain about the pan developing rust. They are iron + sit in water = eventually develop rust.I don't use it for everything, though I could, because sometimes I prefer to set a dirty pan in the sink full of water overnight.I use it mostly for searing, and for baking cornbread and getting that amazing crispiness on the bottom crust.This pan has been easy and non-stick having been pre-seasoned. Just wash and dry after using, add a quick and thin coat of vegetable oil, and it's ready to go for next time. I usually put on burner after towel drying to heat it just a moment, then add the oil to still warm pan, and spread with a bit of paper towel.  That's how my mom used to do it, and it works great for me keeping the pans fresh, well dried, and non-stick.Very happy with this pan, and the price was surprisingly good... Cast iron pans will last a lifetime... or more.

    Best for crab cakes and corn bread
  
",5.0,Anne D. Terry,"Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2018","









  
  
    
  Crab meat is expensive and while crab cakes are not difficult to mix two things are critical. First, scoop 1/2 cup crab mix onto sheet and refrigerate at least two hours or longer. Two, use a Lodge cast iron pan to cook. The heat and heat retention of this Lodge pan quickly seals and sears crab cakes, 3-4 minutes on each side (keep warm in oven if doing more than the four that will fit in the pan. I do not believe you can get the high point of corn bread--a bottom and side crust and a good browned top other than in a pre-heated Lodge cast iron pan and into the oven! I am not much of a meat eater, I serve meat and as noted above crab cakes on special occasions. Friends swear by the searing in a cast iron pan. The thickness, the ability to hold heat as food is added of the cast iron pan is tough to find in other pans. And the price is crazy good. Follow Lodge's directions on cleaning the pan, I store upside down between uses.

  So this is my first ever cast iron pan - after years of having a ceramic stovetop I now have a gas one and lost my last excuse.  I've had the pan about a week now and love everything about it.As a first time cast iron user I read a lot of the reviews here and seasoned it in the ""cathartic"" method (nice review bud!) - heated the pan, rubbed it down with oil and then let it preheat in the oven @ 475, left it for an hour after it preheated and then shut off the oven, left it in there until cool.  Did this three times over a couple days, got a lovely black sheen.  I even ""messed up"" the first time, using too much oil and too little time - to help anyone else who makes the same mistake if you end up with a ""tacky"" pan, simply lightly oil it again and bake it off in the oven just as if you were seasoning - came out perfect!As far as cooking goes - I've had a blast using it.  My first ever meal was steak and cheese - got that nice hard crispy brown ""steak shop"" crust on the shaved steak, delicious!  Next up was attempting a filet and ribeye - again awesome hard brown (not burned!) sear on the exterior and perfect medium / midrare on both (filet went in first, ribeye shortly after).  The last thing was an omelet.  With all this, I've heated up the pan on medium low, added in fat after smoking then added in whatever I was cooking... and it's come out perfectly.  The omelet floated right up above the bacon fat and slid right out of the pan when done!  Awesome!One thing I was worried about was cleaning - knowing I can't use soap and fearful there'd be tons of grit on the bottom had me thinking post-dinner cleanup would be a pain - but it's been so simple.  There's very little stuck to the pan (even the omelet left only a small amount of egg) and the stainless steel ""chainmail"" scrubber I bought with the pan works wonders.  It hasn't been a chore to clean at all, and it was something I was worried about (would the pan never hit the stove if it was a 30 minute process to clean after cooking, eating, dishes, etc?).  Instead, it's almost fun to go through the ritual of scrub, dry, heat and oil (yes I heat the pan after cleaning then rub it down with a tiny bit of oil).So, overall this thing is a bit like a kitchen gremlin, what with all the initial rules and such... but the results are fantastic so far.  It's a joy to cook with and I actually like the little niceties of caring for it.  Like any other tool, take care of it and it will take care of you!

Pour water in the skillet and put it on the stove until the water boiling for a few minutes. -- clean the inside2. Discard the water, then pour another cup of hot water with baking soda to clean it out. -- clean inside/outside3. Put the skillet on the stove to heat dry and apply a thin layer of vegetable oil on both sides. -- season4. Put the skillet in the preheated 450F oven for 1 hour.  -- make the oil dissolve into the small pores on the skillet, which is critical to turn the skillet nonsticky!

  I love my Lodge pans. The only reason I hesitate to give them a 5-star rating s because of minor manufacturing impurities/defects present in the pan that you don't find in more expensive brands. But for the price, Lodge is the best price-performance product that still exceeds minimum standards of excellence to be used in a master chef kitchen.The 10.5"" pan itself is about 5 pounds. If you are not used to sturdy cookware, this may seem heavy, but if you want the best, you may find this to be the optimal balance between sufficient cooking mass to retain and distribute heat, and being still light enough to hold in one hand. I also bought the 15"" and 6"" pans. The 15"" is too big for my stove and way too heavy to hold in one hand. The 6"" pan is light, but a little too small for many cooking jobs. If I had to do it over again, I would have bought the 10.5"" before anything else, then eventually the 6"".Haven't had any issues with rusting, though I always wash, dry, and slightly reheat after each use. Rub a little cooking oil on at the end of each use, too. The only time I wish I had a stainless steel pan is for frying eggs or fish, which are both very difficult to scrape of the pan (and don't need the heating properties of cast iron, anyway).

    Pans like your Mama had
  
",5.0,Carrie Timlin,"Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2012","









  
  
    
  I purchased this pan nearly a year ago, and am now adding to my set. I actually grew up with cast iron frying pans, but it has taken me some time to get used to using them again. I highly recommend these to anyone concerned about the chemicals that leach into your food from non-stick coating or traditionalists or even someone who wants to invest in a pan that will last you a lifetime and never need replacing. You can't break them, you can't ding them, and they won't warp. As long as you take care of them, they will not rust. And you probably get some minor iron intake from cooking in them regularly.Follow the manufacturers instructions about not using soap is the most important thing. Use a stainless steel scouring pad or other scrubber (brush, chain mail) to remove food shortly after cooking. I find that if I leave them dirty on the stove for a day or two, the food debris sort of act as moisture on the pan and can create rust.If you ever get a rust spot, scrub it immediately, dry the pan thoroughly (I like to put mine on the stove for 2 minutes on low to warm the pan and evaporate any moisture), and re-oil it lightly with olive oil or coconut oil on a paper towel. This includes the bottom, which may not make sense to anyone who is grease fire fearful, but we are talking about a light coating to seal out moisture, the pan should look dark on the outside, not shiny or dripping.My best suggestion is to fry bacon! Yes, fry bacon in each pan when you first get it. Although they are pre-seasoned, it is a light seasoning that needs to be reinforced with something greasy several times before you start to develop a deeper seasoning. Before this, you will find that foods will stick, aka, eggs. Stick with the pans, and they will not stick to your food after some time!  Keep to oily foods like bacon, ground beef, or frying something in oil, etc, until you see them darken up a bit, or even follow the manufacturer's instructions on reseasoning, but do it a few times in a row.It will probably take more than a year of regular use for these pans to develop that smooth bottom that you may remember your mama's pans had, but with proper care and oiling, they will be no-stick within a few weeks or months. Always use a bit of cooking oil or butter when you heat them up before adding food, unless it's bacon.Best of all, there is no need for plastic utensils to avoid scratching non-stick coating. You can use stainless steel or wooden!

I’ve been cooking a lot recently and was told, to really up my cooking game I had to get a cast iron skillet, so finally getting around to it. Exchanged the 15” for a 10.5” and it comes tomorrow. Excited to throw some salmon and steaks on this thing!

  Only dislike I have is that Lodge doesn't smooth down the cooking surface a little bit.  It takes a lot, and I mean a lot, of seasoning before it's not pretty rough.  There's a guy named Cowboy Kent Rollins who has good youtube videos on cast iron cooking who uses and orbital sander with 80 grit pads to smooth the inside of the pan before re-seasoning.  I may try that sometime.On the other hand... it's so inexpensive that it's practically free.  I use mine on the stovetop, the oven, on the gas grill in the backyard, on the campfire grate, and directly on the campfire coals.  It does great everywhere.  From bacon and eggs to an awesome NY steak.  If you know how to use cast iron, you can't go wrong with this skillet.

  I have a much larger cast iron skillet I use for dinners and such, but I finally decided a small one would be nice when I need just one egg, or just a little something and don't want to dirty up the whole big pan in the process. This is the perfect size for single-person small batches of food. Love it!  It comes pre-seasoned, which is convenient, but the patina is not significant so I seasoned it again the old fashioned way (oiled and oven baked). It will take much more use to build up just the right surface, but even with the from-the-store level of finish, it is a mostly non-stick surface.  So yay for that too. Very happy with this, and I wish I'd bought one a long time ago!

  Just what you'd expect from a Lodge.  This skillet is so large that I can put this across two burners on our stovetop.  It's nice having the extra surface space to cook things like several eggs without having them all bunched up.  Or, I can cook pancakes and eggs on the same surface at the same time.  Only thing with this size is that it's very heavy.  I expected that but some might not anticipate the weight if they haven't used cast iron before. These skillets last forever as long as you don't completely abuse it so I expect to use it for the rest of my life.

  As soon as I got this pan I gave it a quick rinse, wiped it down with oil and seasoned it in the oven for several hours.  The first time I used it, I made pan seared ribeyes and they turned out so good.  The thick cast iron holds in heat better than my previous thin stainless pan and it reduced the cook time of my steaks by a couple minutes.  I've only used it to cook steaks and burgers, but cleanup has been super simple and the results of the food cooked in it have been really good.  $15 for a pan that will outlast you is a pretty fair deal.

  I purchased this skillet a long time ago and finally go around to season it properly and start using it. I have been using a similar but ribbed skillet for years to cook chicken on a gas stove. I like the strips that a ribbed skillet provides, but I also like how much easier it is to clean this flat surface skillet compared to a ribbed one. It's holding up well so far to my weekly meal prep that involves 10-12 lbs of chicken breast that goes through it. If you have never cooked in an iron skillet, try it. You're likely to never go back to other pans. The only hassle is the additional effort in scrubbing and cleaning, but that's a small price to pay for great tasting food time after time after time.

  I was concerned about food sticking to the pan. Even though it says the pan is ""pre-seasoned"", I still felt the need to season the pan a little bit.I heated half of an inch of oil on medium/medium-high for several minutes until it just started to smoke, then I turned it down low and let the hot oil ""simmer"" uncovered for a half-hour or so. I also rubbed the frying-surface a little bit with the tip of a wooden spatula while the hot oil bubbled around it. Then I poured out the excess oil, and I put the pan into the hot oven after some baking was done, and I let the pan cool as the oven cooled.The next morning I put the pan on a Medium/Low burner, allowed it to heat up, splashed a small amount of oil into it, and fried an egg...THE EGG DID NOT STICK, NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT. Then I wiped the pan with a paper towel, and it was clean.Perfect. I feel this pan is ready for decades of service, as long as it is treated properly.

Its the hardest thing in the world to keep clean. I used it for one meal and have sat it on the side and probably will throw away. Its just way too difficult. Cast iron shouldn't be difficult in fact they should be rather easy to work with, but this was not.

  Since learning to cook on cast iron a couple years ago, Lodge has been a mainstay in my kitchen. I was wary of the silicon grip at first, wondering how effective it would be, but it has proved very effective in eliminating the need for a mitt when handling the handle of the pan. Like all Lodge products, it comes pre-seasoned, so it is ready to use out of the box, though I chose to put it through the oven with oil a couple times (personal preference). It's the perfect size for cooking individual meals or even cooking for a few folks, though some folks might find it a little heavy. (It's cast iron, after all). I used it the other weekend to cook a potato dish that fed 15 people, and I use it a couple mornings a week for omelets. If you're looking to start cooking on cast iron, I firmly believe you can't go wrong with Lodge.

  I’ve gone through several cast iron pans. This one is by far the best one. I bought this late 2018 and still use it at least 3-4 times a week. It really brings out the flavor of every dish. I even made deep dish pizza with it. Every kitchen needs to have this pan! Make sure you season it after every wash. If yours comes with a silicon holder, don’t use it.

I'll be treating it myself going forward, and suggest this for others as well. Other than this, I like the size and performance. If you're cooking anything larger than a couple of eggs (e.g. sautéing veggies or cooking hamburger meat) you'll want at least this size (10.25 "").

  This seems like a really great pan, although I feel like I ruined it after the second use. Maybe it's because these are ""high-maintenance"" but I tried to cook a steak on this by pan searing it and pretending it was a grill... One of my friends told me you can do this by putting it in the oven at 500 degrees, and I did that, but it didn't stay hot for long enough to continue cooking it. So the next time I put it at a high temp on the stove top and slammed down those steaks, and not long after that the fire alarm was going off and we had to air out the house. I DO know how to cook in general, but maybe not with a cast iron skillet. My boyfriend cleaned it without soap, but I noticed it looked weird, and possibly hadn't gotten cleaned completely. It seemed like there was still burnt crust on it still. So I took a brillo pad and very gently rubbed it around on it. Blackness ensued. Then I took oil and rubbed it around with paper towels, and it came off black, the blackness wouldn't stop. I finally used coarse salt to scrub at it, but it was still black. So I feel like I've already ruined it by taking off it's top layer. I'm now afraid to use it again.

  I recommend the 12"" cast iron skillet, it has a 10.5"" cooking surface and you can cook two burgers side-by-side in this pan. Canola oil works well with this pan (vegetable oil might fill your kitchen with smoke). To cook burgers, season the burger patty with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Heat the pan up on 7 (medium-high) until you see the first sign of smoke coming off of the pan, turn it down to 5 (medium heat) and add the burger. Flip the burger after 2-3 minutes, flip again after 2-3 minutes, and then flip it every minute until they're done. You can cook a burger as thick as you want by adding a few minutes on medium heat (I've cooked up to 0.75 lb burger patties). I seasoned the pan 5 times with flaxseed oil before using it for the first time and it helped smooth the surface slightly. However, any modern cast iron pan really needs to be sanded smooth to be considered a non-stick pan.

  I haven't used non-enameled cast iron since my later childhood years.  I always had some good memories with Lodge...grandma's pancakes, a hearty stew cooking in a Ben Franklin wood burning stove and so on...  I love my Le Creuset (the only enameled cast iron I'll buy), but I have been wanting to bring back some old family recipes, prepared in their traditional way...with Lodge...still made in the USA...I had to get some pieces.I've always hated nonstick, Teflon coated and the like cookware.  I even tried enamel over metal pans...they work ok, but I like cooking with fats and oils...and that tends to make the enameled layer not so nonstick and the flavors just aren't right.  So, back to Lodge...I almost forgot how inexpensive and easy these are to care for.  I  started with this 10.25"" skillet.  It was easy to clean with mild soap before use.  I did a quick seasoning (although it is pre-seasoned well) with an organic cast iron oil...super easy!My first ""dish"" made in this was a custardy French toast for my daughter and I.  The heat was easy to attain, and our French toast cooked evenly and to perfection.  --Absolutely no sticking.  I seriously wasn't expecting nonstick effect upon first use!!!  The butter and coconut oil I used melted beautifully...no scorching and the oils were evenly distributed in the dish, while cooking.  I was also able to use stainless steel utensils without fear.  I've always made a good French toast, but this batch was my best yet.  The egg mixture that overflowed and surrounded the toast was delicate and fluffy (as it should be)...not the hardened crispy fried egg effect (gross).The most beautiful part of our experience with this Lodge fry pan....clean up...everything wiped out with just a simple paper towel, mild soap and water wash, then quick seasoning on the stove, wipe out excess, put away.  This seriously is the best no frills, no stress, ""no need to sacrifice or skimp on flavor"" and ""healthy for you"" nonstick cookware...and it's just about as inexpensive as the throw away, unhealthy nonstick cookware at your local discount store.What I love about Lodge cast iron...it can be put on a campfire, grill, wood burning stove or firepit and still keep it's appearance with simple care (no worries over pretty enamel getting ugly or metals losing it's shine or luster) and STILL be able to use it on the stove or in the oven...no warping.  It's an inexpensive investment that I'll be able to pass down; along with my more expensive investments like Le Creuset, All Clad and Mauviel.  I also love that Lodge cast iron is made in Tennessee, USA.  (*their enameled items are made in China)  It's not ""beautiful"", but I love incorporating it's rawness with the beautiful...nice balance in a functional kitchen.I also purchased the 5qt Lodge Dutch Oven

  Some people will tell you that it is laborious to have a cast iron skillet.  Not so with the Lodge!  I watched a lot of videos on the youtube about cleaning and care and people were all over the board about removing the factory seasoning and starting over.  No way.  I washed the pan after I received it and the first several times I cooked with it I used some vegetable oil and butter to make sure nothing stuck.  The directions say you can even use soap and water to clean it, so I do.  Then I put it back on the burner for a few minutes to dry as I do the rest of my dishes and Then I rub some vegetable Crisco all over it and then wipe it down real good and put it away for the day.  So maybe 1 extra step in the cleanup process.  I have cooked eggs and meats and so far I have had nothing stick.

  I love cast iron. I have two pans from Great Gatherings (Big Lots store brand). One is a large and deep welled 11-1/2 inch pan and one is a smaller 10 inch pan. I now wanted an even smaller pan to round out my collection, but Great Gatherings doesn't make a smaller size, so I decided to go with the 8 inch Lodge pan. Lodge is a name that many people associate with cast iron, and it is an extremely popular (and costly) brand, so I expected a top quality pan for my money.When I opened the box and felt the heft of the 8 inch pan I was surprised. It was heavier than expected. Not a bad thing for me. And it was much thicker than expected as well. Again, not a bad thing. In fact, it was slightly thicker than my two other pans, which is why it had more heft than I expected.I ordered two pans, one for myself and one for my daughter, so I compared the finish and quality of both...that is where I was disappointed. Although I expected the pans to be rough, all cast iron brands are rough these days, (except for one or two brands that are extremely expensive), these were even rougher than I expected. But even that I could live with because with proper seasoning, and continuous use, the pans will smooth out and be slick. yet, I was surprised they were much rougher ""out of the box"" than the inexpensive Big Lots brand I already owned.Most cast iron come from the factory pre-seasoned, but anyone who owns cast iron cookware knows, you still need to season your pan before use. Usually the pans arrive lightly, yet evenly pre-seasoned, but both of my Lodge pans arrived with uneven seasoning and with heavy doses of oil on parts of the pan, that was sticky. That should not be, so before I began to season my pans I had heat them to soften the seasoning and smooth them out with a metal scrubbing pad. It took a while to do, but I got the job done. Then I took to giving the pans two rounds of seasoning to get them cook worthy.I used one this morning and it was fine. I made fried eggs in it (yes, you can make eggs in today's rough cast iron pans) and sticking was minimal as expected. One reason my eggs stuck was I cracked them into the pan before the pan was fully heated. And second, I used a plastic spatula to release them from the pan instead of a metal spatula. The trick to cooking on cast iron is knowing when the pan is hot enough to add your food, and using the right utensils. Also, it is important to know when to gently shift your food in the pan...example, if you are frying up some chicken wait until it has cooked a while before you nudge pieces to shift them in the pan...nudge them too soon, and they may resist and stick slightly, but get out your metal spatula and shovel it under after the chicken has cooked a while and it will slide without sticking.In conclusion, I expected more from Lodge. I expected the pans to be rough, but not so rough, and that they would be better, and more evenly seasoned. But in the end, if they last a lifetime, as they should, I won't remember the misgivings in years from now.

",5.0,Joe Bush,"Reviewed in the United States September 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought the 13.25"" skillet to complement the 20"" Lodge griddle we've had (and loved) for over a decade. As expected, the skillet is solid, heavy, and BIG. Carefully measure your cooking space (stove burners, outdoor grill, etc...) before purchasing this skillet to ensure it's a good fit. Additionally, make sure the skillet can fit in your sink to be washed. It may seem silly to stress this point but I forgot to measure my sink and lucked out in that the skillet fits, but with only an inch to spare! So far I love this versatile skillet and reach for it at every opportunity. It is roomy enough to put a great sear on a large roast, the sides are tall enough to deep fry chicken, you can make gravy, beautifully caramelize onions, whip up a party-sized batch of cornbread, and the list goes on. I've had absolutely no problem cleaning the skillet. Let it cool completely so that it's safe to handle, pour any remaining oil into an appropriate container, and use a pan scraper to remove as much residue as possible. To avoid damaging your sink, especially if it's enamel, line it with kitchen towels and then transfer the skillet to it. Fill the skillet with very hot water and let rest for a few minutes to soften stuck-on food before using a scraper or non-abrasive scrub brush. Pour out the water and repeat the process as necessary. Give a final rinse and  thoroughly dry with a lint-free cloth. Moisten a paper towel with some cooking oil and apply a light coating to the skillet before storing it in a dry location. I can' t say enough good things about this skillet and the many tasty meals it's produced.

    I needed to brown 3 large pork chops last night and they fit beautifully in this new pan
  
",5.0,PITA,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2017","









  
  
    
  Been wanting another cast iron pan.  I first bought the 10 inch.  Almost immediately I regretted not getting a bigger one.  I still use the 10 inch but you definitely need a bigger pan if you cook for others and not just yourself.  I needed to brown 3 large pork chops last night and they fit beautifully in this new pan.  The pan could have held a 4th but would have been a tight fit.  I frequently make rack of lamb as Costco sells a great Australian brand that is very affordable.  Searing it in the 10 inch was kind of a pain.  Now that I have the 13.25 inch pan I like it much better.  No matter what you are going to get splatter on your stove top, but the larger pan helps keep more in the pan and not on the stove.  The only thing I don't care for is the weight of the pan.  Even the 10 inch is HEAVY.  I just have to work out more I guess and build up my biceps.  I have to use both hands to lift the 13.25 inch one.  That to me is not a deal breaker but, dang, they are heavy.  It was also important to me that this product is American made.  Big selling point for me every time.  If you have a glass stove top (as we do) you must be careful not to drag or shake the pans on your stove top as the cast iron WILL scratch the glass.  Care is easy as well.  You can give it a quick scrub using cold water and then just wipe it out with a cloth or paper towel.  Never use soap on it.  Sometimes I'll put a tablespoon of kosher salt in the pan as a scrubbing agent.  Make sure to re-season it with oil (I use olive or avocado oil) before putting it away.  It will last you generations.

  This pan is amazing. If you have never tried cast iron, you should. I have used (far far more expensive) ""swiss diamond"" nonstick pans in the past, and while that doesn't scratch as easily as other nonstick pans, it still wears out. Even with a lifetime warranty, you still pay shipping when the screws wear out. This pan, on the other hand, is indestructible. I have left the heat on and forgotten about it, no problem. I can use a sharp metal spatula without worrying. The iron even seems to add a bit of flavor to the food. As for non-stickiness, the other day I cooked an egg in it with just a tiny bit of sausage grease. The egg didn't even try to stick. For cleaning, it is a breeze as you just run some water over it and brush off any gunk. If you find out a way to get something to stick to it, you can just put it in the oven to burn it off, and reseason. Try that with a nonstick pan.Last but not least, this is the new weapon of choice if a burglar comes.

  Love this! Cast iron is life changing when it comes to cooking. My husband and I love it. We did the full seasoning process when we got it (look up the process on YouTube), even though the manual said it came pre-seasoned. But since then, haven't had to redo the the process, and almost no washing required as it is so non-stick. Just wipe it out with a paper towel once it cools and occasionally rub a little olive oil in it. As long you let it heat for a few minutes on med-low before putting the food in, it's 100% non-stick and cooks perfectly. We highly recommend it!

    Not bad for a mid grade piece of cast iron
  
",5.0,Rob,"Reviewed in the United States November 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  I'll start by saying I absolutely hate the pre-seasoning Lodge uses on all their stuff, it sticks and is generally just not great. HOWEVER the iron is great quality it just takes a little TLC to get it to the point that it's truly non stick. What I did for starters is I used yellow cap easy off oven cleaner with lye and coated the skillet thoroughly and sealed it in a trash bag, then after about two days pull it out and wash all that seasoning off down to the bare iron(May take two passes to get it all off) Then I took my sanding mouse and smoothed out the iron inside the skillet, once it was nice and smooth to the touch I gave it a nice wash with soap and a sponge. And after all that I began the seasoning process, I use flax seed oil for the initial seasoning then grape seed oil for maintaining it. I seasoned it three times and after that the beast was non stick and I could slide an egg around in it. I have to give credit to the idea of sanding it to Kent Rollins on youtube, I suggest any beginner to go check him out he has some great videos about cast iron. Anyways all in all I'm really pleased with this skillet and would definitely recommend it.

  It just doesn't compare to a vintage cast iron skillet when it comes to making eggs.  The lack of a polished bottom really tells.

I bought this to supplement my big 12 inch Griswold when I just want to make some eggs and don't need the huge pan.The difference is massive.  Nothing sticks to the 60+ y/o Griswold.  Everything sticks to the Loge.I've used cast iron for nearly 40 years.  I know how to season a pan.  That's not the issue.Loge really ought to offer a line of polished skillets.

  This is for the 3.5” Lodge Cast Iron fry pan. The description says good for “frying an egg”. That might be true for a hummingbird egg, but definitely way to small for a chicken egg. Even if you cooked a minuscule egg, the pan would only work over a match or lighter flame, anything much bigger would also burn the tiny handle (which you can only grasp with one finger and thumb). I keep this fry pan on the 3” ledge behind my stove to remind me to not take description claims as fact.  This might be good for a toddler’s toy stove to play make-believe.

  Things for Lodge have somehow gone even further downhill. I know this isn't the Lodge of even the post-war era, but that is is even worse than that of the early 2000s is surprising. With a parrot in the house, we needed to replace our non-stick cookware. With years of experience in using cast iron, these moderately priced Lodge pans seemed a good option -- until they arrived.The cooking surface is so rough that it is unusable, even with proper seasoning. Read up on it, you can't smooth it out as apparently it won't take seasoning if you do any more that remove the sharp points of the rough surface.Soy oil is used for seasoning, which for those with allergies or sensitivities is beyond problematic. The seasoning can't be removed with any reasonable cleaning approach used for cast iron.There's a reason Lodge acquired Finex this year, apparently they either or both can't manufacture a quality product, or their brand's value has plummeted so far as to be unrecoverable.Do yourself a favor, buy a https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00076QWTA/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 or similar if you're looking for an inexpensive, ""seasonable"" pan.

First time cast iron skillet owners should be aware that they need proper care and any issues arising from putting it in the dishwasher (or other bad ideas) isn't the skillet's fault.

  I was initially skeptical about cast iron. After using it for a few months, I appreciate the consistent temperature it can maintain. It holds a lot of heat, so varying the burner temperature does not immediately affect it, and it can heat more substance without quickly losing temperature.It is slow to heat up (as well as slow to cool), but it's very consistent, so harder to burn things on.  Cleaning so far has been simple, with nothing really sticking (and don't be afraid to use dish soap).The seasoning is a bit bumpy, but I don't really see a problem with that.  Some people re-sand and re-season, but I have no idea why that would make a difference, especially if you're used to steel (+teflon) pans.

  I have read a couple of reviews complaining about the Lodge pan's rough surface.  A few people referred to other pans that are WAY more expensive.  With a little effort, it's easy to smooth and re-season a Lodge pan for next to nothing.  A common drill with some inexpensive sanding pads (start at 60 grit, end at 240 grit) and in less than an hour you have a super smooth pan.  After sanding, clean in hot water and dry.  Put a light coat of flaxseed oil on the pan (dripping is too much) then bake up side down at 400 degrees for 90 minutes.  Allow to cool in oven and you have a BETTER pan than the super expensive guys.  (Photos attached of the process.)

Even so, I finally purchased this because I needed a large skillet for cooking for larger numbers of people.

  There are plenty of people online that will tell you that you need a smooth surface on cast iron like the old Griswold and Wagner skillets in order to get a nonstick pan. The truth is, as long as you baby the seasoning for the first few weeks, it'll fill in just fine. Mine is a beautiful shiny black after just 2 months of use, and as long as you know how to cook on cast iron (preheat the pan, don't use high heat, etc.), then you shouldn't have an issue with sticking. I just use a Knapp chainmail scrubber after cooking and it cleans up just fine.

The pan provides a noticeable taste different in food. It also an absolutely swiss army knife in the kitchen. Stove top, over, grill, you name it. Holds heat and wont let you down. If you plan on cooking a good steak with out a grill this is the best pan to do it - sear it for a few minutes on a stove top and just transfer the whole skillet into the oven to finish.Tip(s): 1 .It says it comes preseasoned, but I would recommend also preseasoning before you use it. If you google it, there are a million ways/opinions on how to do it if you are unsure.2. Get a grease splatter guard. Keeps your stove top clean and minimizes clean up.

  I've been married for almost six years now and have been doing the majority of cooking for about four years. I've owned a few cheap non-stick pans when we were super-poor, bought some decent non-stick pans when times were looking up, some stainless pans that were hand-me downs, and I've replaced them all with a couple Lodge cast iron pans. I managed to destroy a couple non-stick pans by overheating them or scratching them or looking at them funny. I had never used a cast-iron pan but after a little research I realized how nice they can be for not much money. Seriously, this pan cost half the price of some of the ""better"" pans I had bought.It comes pre-seasoned but I realize that it will take some work and time to get it really well seasoned and truly non stick. The fist couple uses I did nothing but cook bacon, caramelize onions or crisp up tortillas. Nothing too fancy just to get used to it and help break it in. Bacon wanted to stick initially but moving the strips around as I set in helped lubricate it and once the fat started to render out there as no problem with sticking whatsoever. After about 10 or so uses it's much more non-stick than it was and I'm sure it will just get better.What I wasn't prepared for though was how much heat retention this pan has. Once it gets hot it stays hot and for a long time. Food cooks faster because of that. I'm used to putting food in a hot pan and immediately losing a bunch of heat. This thing stays hot and cooks food FAST. I've had to adjust my cooking temperatures and times a little bit to re-adjust. Overall though, with a little bit of re-learning I wouldn't think about cooking with anything else now. I'll probably pick up a second one because it's so cheap and indestructible.

  After using it for a week I have to say this is one of my best purchases to date. I see a lot of people complaining about it “sticking” and I would have to say that is user error. I put some olive oil in it and essentially cooked the oil then wiped it clean before the first use and it cooked my chicken wonderfully . If needed you could always put some water in it bring it to a boil and wipe it clean when it cools down. Just make sure to add a little bit of your choice of cooking oil after you clean it. I find it especially wonderful for making pizza, turns out perfect every time.

This one came w/ neat silicone removable handle that comes in handy when handling while hot. With proper care this is one of rare items that gets better after each use, recommended for sure.

  Love it! This is my first cast iron skillet, prior to this I had been using non-stick and stainless steel. Have to admit, I was always intimidated by cast iron because of the care it requires. Realized how wrong I was after cooking with it! I wanted to start making dishes that required stove top to oven cooking and had read that cast iron was perfect for just that. After doing some research, I decided on this one for the quality and affordability. First dish I made, I seared some meat and finished cooking it in the oven. Sidenote: I love how this process only uses one pan -- less to clean! I was initially worried that the meat was going to get stuck to the pan -- but it didn't! Produced the perfect sear that my previous skillets cannot even compete with and the meat turned out delicious! Next, I was concerned that it would be difficult to clean, since there was some bits burned and stuck on the bottom. When this happens in my stainless steel pan I'd have to soak and scrub and scrub...I was amazed when I only had to use a bit of water and some light scrubbing and rinsing to get it up. No soap needed! Took about a minute and the skillet looks just as good as brand new, can't even tell I used it, and it is still well seasoned. Which is another thing I'd like to remark on -- Lodge did a phenomenal job preseasoning! I can't wait to put this to regular use in my kitchen. Also, I used silicone oven mitts when cooking with this and it made it so much easier to transfer the pan, with the grip and the heat resistance. Definitely plan on purchasing more cast iron from this brand.

  The small 8” cast iron pan from Lodge was a disappointment. The interior of the pan looked like a matte finish of a newly rough tarred road. We own an older and larger pan from Lodge and it came with a smooth interior and once seasoned, works beautifully. What has happened? Is the company sending out unfinished pans in order to save a manufacturing step and money? Too darn bad!

  Quality is fine. This will still be a useful addition and we will use it but...it's nowhere close to the size that is quoted in the product description. The product dimensions are listed as 19x13x6. Actual dimensions are 19x13x2.25. That's right, 2.25 in instead of 6in. So, I went out to the Lodge website to look at their product specs. Lodge does not even list a skillet/deep skillet that is 6in deep. The deepest they list is 3.975in. Most of the skillets at the Lodge website are between 2in and 2.25in.This specific skillet sold at Amazon as a deep skillet, is in fact the normal Lodge 12in skillet which has a cost of $39.50 at the Lodge website. So, basically you get a typical Lodge 12in skillet plus the silicone hot handle for the same price as the skillet at the Lodge website (e.g. no savings).I just feel that Amazon/Lodge should just be upfront about what is really being sold. It's not a ripoff, but it's also not as advertised.

  This is certainly one of the simplest items to review on Amazon.  It seems to be well cast, as this pan has gone straight from the stove-top to the oven to the cold sink (not a good idea) and has not cracked or warped at all.  The handle is fairly easy to grip with an oven mitt or dish towel.  I've used this pan for everything from morning eggs to deep dish pizza, and it has performed admirably.  The factory seasoning is superb and easy to clean.  I live with 3 other college students who don't know how to properly take care of cast iron, yet it has survived all the abuse it's been subjected to.  I've had to re-season it a number of times, but that is to be expected with any cast iron cookware in this setting.  This is probably the best new cast iron on the market.

  When you need a BIG cast iron pan, this is it. This falls in the be careful what you wish for category, like 12” chef knives. It’s heavy, and big, so washing it by hand in the sink you need to take care not to dent the steel or chip the countertop. It’s not going to play nice in a jumble of other pots and pans in that hard to reach occasional use cabinet. But it does what only a cast iron pan can do. Also makes a passable cat bed.

  Definitely a one-person serving pan, as the 8 inches is just barely enough to cook two medium sized chicken breasts. but as one person who uses this pan, this is the BEST pan for cooking meat - hands down. I take good care of it, every once in a while i clean and season the pan, and after every use i scrub WITHOUT soap just elbow grease and a brush. If there's stuck food on the pan just pour a little water in it, leave the water simmering on the stove while ya eat, and scrub it off again.I wouldn't call this a non-stick pan but i use a pastry brush to brush a little oil on every time i use it and that does the trick to keep most food from sticking. a little food might still stick though, get over it.

  For one of the leaders in the cast-iron pots industry, I was surprised with what I got. There is a crack in the pan that appears to have been welded over. I could see bumping this against something some day and the piece fall off. Second, there's an instructional cardboard flyer that they GLUED to the pan. Yes, glued. This rubbery glue was difficult to take off and some residue remained, so I had to scrub it off, which removed some of the seasoning. Why Lodge thought they had to do this (which is also not so environmentally sensitive) is beyond me. I'm returning it.

  This pan is great, I think its a nice size and you can cook a lot of things with it, its really good for induction tops, but if you got a glass top I recommend parchment paper to go underneath it to prevent scratching. Great for searing meats and things.I think many of the reviews that involve rusting and what not are because people did not take care of their cast iron properly.Rule of thumb: You shouldn't wash your cast iron with soap and water, just give it a nice rinse and scrub it with a hard side of a sponge, immediately dry it, and slather some oil around it to preserve the seasoning. If you just take care of your cast iron, it will do you a great benefit.Cast Iron is really good for you in general, as you can cook using high heat and it won't release chemical fumes unlike using a teflon coated pan. You can also use metal utensils on cast iron when cooking, I would limit the use, but again no teflon chemical poisoning. It also cooks very evenly and distributes heat nicely, while aluminum pans may also do this, there is a lot going around about aluminum leaching into food while cooking, you should stick to anodize aluminum instead.Just do your research before you buy the cast iron, it's wonderful, and even better if you use induction cooktops.

  We've gone through a few grills in anodize aluminum, they get really stick-prone after a few years. Stainless steel is just awful for frying and incredibly hard to clean. Teflon wears out. Cast iron is where it's at. I mean for stock pots and sauce pans stainless is probably better. But for frying and grilling, CAST IRON! After using it for a few weeks the seasoning on this is pretty good. I have read that super smooth cast iron is better, and we have a really old smooth 13"" Wagner classic iron frypan up at our shared mountain cabin. (The really sought after kind.) I think the Wagner is about perfect, but this new Lodge pan is actually pretty darn good. I have recently come to appreciate cast iron, what I really notice is that you can truly brown meat and even veggies really quickly, whereas stainless and aluminum it take far longer and just doesn't get as brown and crispy. Also fried hash browns are actually very crispy in a cast iron pan, whereas is stainless or aluminum they just aren't. We've done eggs and fritatas and Dutch Babies in the pan and they don't stick much at all.  At the price this is just a steal. I would say everyone needs one of these pans, they are just awesome.

It came out looking great and is now ready for use.I've had Lodge skillets in the past but lost them, usually as a result from moving from one apartment to another when all of my possessions, mostly books and LP's, could fit in my old VW Beetle in just two trips.  I had more books than anything else and they were heavy.  Asking me to sacrifice a book would have been like requesting that I offer up a child for sacrifice!  So the heaviest of items were usually omitted from the move(s).  What are LP's?  Google it.At a young age one isn't as enamored with quality cookware or can appreciate its durability or longevity as one can today.  Of course I am speaking of this 'one' who is so old that he knew dirt before God.Lodge cookware has been setting the standard for incredible quality for generations.  I have absolutely no doubt that this incarnation of my Lodge cast iron skillet will perform as exceptionally as my other skillets.  Of course, they never were around long enough to establish the classic seasoning that Lodge has become known for.This skillet will be with me for a very long time and this baby will have the time to grow into its seasoning, by golly, by gosh!

  Just the right size to make one burger or a small batch of eggs. I have a larger lodge pan and found it cumbersome to clean, especially for one person.  Right out of the box this was very  easy to season (I use flax seed to season all my cast iron).  It cleans like a dream - even with burnt on cheese.

  My husband mentioned to me that he wished we had a “larger” cast iron skillet so I saw this 15” and decided to try it because I thought the price was reasonable. We love this pan and I just think everything tastes better when it’s fried in a cast iron skillet. I’m not gonna lie, it is heavy but at least it does have your long handle on one side and the smaller grab handle on the other side so you do have two handles to make carrying it easier.

I did not want to put it with water so I tried to clean it immidiatly after using it. The problem that it was too hot to be touched (it is all made from iron).I put it on the marble to be cooled but after a few minuts it had a rust stain.What about the food? a rust flavor is not one of my favored tastes so I throw to the garbage with the  Skillet itself.

  This is almost exactly like the type of iron skillets that I grew up with. It’s not as large as the ones that we had but that’s okay. I knew that it wouldn’t be. It’s medium sized and just what I needed. Everyone must have at least one iron skillet. It came already prepared and seasoned. I never knew that you weren’t supposed to wash them. I always washed ours growing up. I just get really weird when it comes to what is stuck in the grease that I cannot see when I use it again. That’s just me though. I’m sure that you would get better results if you didn’t wash it and reseason. Thank you for the fast shipping too. Now I wish I would have gotten the rubber cover that goes on the handle. I think I’ll have to purchase one.

  I had 3 cast iron pans before but one got ruined and I am now down to 2.  I make cornbreads as gifts around Christmas and missed being able to do 3 at a time. I found this on Amazon and oredered.  While they are “preseasoned” I always season them again at least once or twice before using.  My other two are black now and this one needs to be close to that before I will use for the cornbreads.  I wash them with a scrubber or nylon brush (no soap) and put them on a burner until they are dry.  If the black looks a little thin I rub a thin layer of oil in them while they ate still hot or I will oil them and put in the oven.

  This pan is made with the usual Lodge quality, and the Rosie the Riveter tribute is wonderful.  I recommend this pan to any cast iron cookware enthusiast.

  This skillet really is a great skillet for just under $35.00.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was the fact that it was pre-seasoned from the company, however, I have had to give it a few more seasonings.  But this is such an easy thing to do that I didn't mind putting forth the extra effort due to the price.  I used it this morning for breakfast and had some foods stick - just a bit - so I decided to give it one more seasoning go around - 3 in total.  Should be great after this.  I highly recommend this skillet if you don't want to purchase a higher price one and don't mind the little extra effort needed.

Use flax seed oil for a hard, fragile seasoning, or grapeseed oil for a soft, clingy seasoning.3. Use a soft sponge, adding salt for abrasion if necessary.A review:For a $30 pan, the quality is acceptable. The pan works exactly as advertised, including the pre-seasoning.

  As person who loves to cook I love anything that makes cooking easier.  So when I first got married, I wanted stainless steel everything.  I bought a beautiful set of stainless steel T-Fal cookware.  I quickly learned that stainless steel is not the way to go unless you want to be best friends with Pam (the cooking spray) or if you use a lot of cooking oils (butter, grease, shortening) in your foods.  So I bought more T-Fal, this time I purchased 2 non-stick skillets for my daily usage.  I learned a short time after purchasing that non-stick fades.  Suddenly I started finding little black chips in my eggs and the interior of the skillet had all kinds of scratches as the non-stick coating was peeling.  I did some research and found this is a common occurence in non-stick cookware.  And it will happen to every item sooner or later.  I also found that the little non-stick chips are toxic.  Well, that was enough for me.  What else is there?  Cast Iron.  I decided to buy an iron skillet for the health benefits as well as the longevity of the cookware.  How many grandmothers, mothers and aunt have a cast iron skillet from 20, 30, years ago?  Pretty much every cook I know.  So I knew going into the purchase that this would be a long term investment of time.  But after 3 years... it was all worth it.I cook pretty much everything in this skillet.  From eggs to fried chicken to alfredo sauce to grilled cheese sandwiches.  This is my go to skillet.  The only thing I dont cook in this is anything with tomatoes or tomato sauce.  The acid from the tomato just kills the nice non-stick loving I have going in this skillet.  Besides that its a perfect size for large and small meals.I've heard of different methods for cleaning and seasoning an iron skillet.  As much as they say that this skillet is pre-seasoned, it is not non-stick yet.  You have to do that work yourself.  Personally, this is what I did when I first got it.I used it for everything!  Eggs, baked chicken, fried foods, burgers, pretty much anything you can cook.  You have to actually USE it.After I cook in it, I cleaned it with only HOT water and a really really tough nylon scrub brush.  Sometimes, I would sit and scrub that thing for what seemed like hours.  Sometimes, it took an overnight soaking in hot water to get out baked on lasagna.  Never use dish detergent or put it in the dishwasher.  The soap with eat away at the non-stick layer you're slowing building up.Either way, after you clean it, dry it completely with a towel.  Not a paper towel because the surface of the skillet will scratch away little fibers from the paper towel and you'll have small white things stuck to your skillet.  Place the skillet on the stove on high heat and use a small bit of shortening and very, very, lightly grease the interior of the skillet.  I have an old cotton dinner napkin that I keep specifically for this purpose.  Keep it on the burner and let it heat up until you see the skillet begin to smoke.  Turn off the burner and let the skillet sit while it cools.Over time, using this method every time will get you that nice non-stick layer.  Of course, this layer is just shortening or cooking grease building up and baking into the skillet.3 years into this, I don't have to season it like this anymore.  I just cook on it, wash it with hot water and my scrub brush and dry it completely. Good luck with this method.

  For a woman who is not terribly strong, it is heavy.  I had trouble placing it in a hot oven without spilling a little because I couldn't hold it even  from just one hand on the red safety handle provided.  Also, although I greased it well before baking cornbread, even after the first use it seems the finish is slightly damaged.  I  hope not. Afterwards, I greased it well after carefully rinsing it (not scrubbing it).  I guess time will tell whether I'll need to re-season it already.

  i had been reluctant to own cast iron because of the ""fear"" of all food sticking to it and clean up being laborious.  Neither of those notions I had are true with this pan.  Meats, eggs, pancakes, etc leave very little sticking to the bottom or sides.  From stove top to oven in the same pan is very convenient.  The only reason I put 4 stars on ""easy to clean"" is because the pan does require a bit more attention than rinsing and throw into the dishwasher.  I usually just scrub the bottom with my brush and water, maybe a touch of liquid soap, and dry well.  I heat it and add a teaspoon of oil and wipe it around after cleaning.  Of note...it is beyond slightly heavy, surely being a 2 hand pan to handle for 95% of users.

  I cooked in cast iron skillets years ago but they went with the ex. so thought I'd start cooking again in cast iron. These new Lodge cast iron skillets are nothing like the old ones. Maybe if you do as the youtubers say and sand the bottom smooth it may be ok but why should I have to do that. If I coat the bottom with Crisco and leave it in the oven while I bake something @  375 for an hour it will be non stick the next time I use it, but then if I do not repeat this process it will stick. i clean it while it is hot using only very hot water no soap, no scrub pads. If you want to use cast iron that is great, but invest in the older smooth bottom ones.

I scrambled some eggs up the other day, no problems at all, but, again it's not a stick free teflon skillet.  I seasoned it again out of the box, even though it says it's pre-seasoned.

It has spoiled my last minute week day dinner , so I had to get this after getting reviews from friends.I bought the 8 inch pan when there was some discount on it.It is pre-seasoned but , I did wash it before use and seasoned it again. So far I have prepared fried fish, eggs omlette - without getting over done, chicken fajita , veggie stir fry.. all came out very good . The handle is sturdy and needs to be picked using mitts when hot.This definitely needs proper before and after care , I season it after every use.

  Perfect size for two-person meals. I haven't used it yet, but i do plan to season it again before i do, just to be on the safe side with the non-stick aspect of it.Update 08/18/18: I had to season this pan twice in a row to get a good surface, then two things: first, when making fried eggs, I had to be more patient--the pan will let go when the underside is cooked enough. I am used to making eggs over easy, and I still can, but I need to wait just a bit longer to be able get the pan to release the egg. Second, if only doing a simple fry, I just wipe it down with a paper towel after letting it cool about 5-10 min to get any excess oil and/or food particles, and that's it. This method has definitely helped with creating the perfect surface for frying and searing.

  I am a college student and I bought this to use for camping and then I just started using it in the kitchen and now I use it everyday. I am also looking at getting another one. I did not season this skillet in the oven as other reviewers mentioned. Food did stick to it for the first couple uses, but it scraped off with no particular difficulty. After a few uses I could cook an egg without it sticking at all, with some oil.I now cook everything in this skillet. I even put it right on the table to serve the food in. It looks great and stays hot for a very long time relative to cookware of other materials. I have been using it for about a month and a layer of polymerized oil has build up on the bottom. There is a 1/2 inch ring near the wall of the skillet where there is no built up seasoning yet but it does not seem to affect the nonstick quality.I just use this on an old style heating element on my kitchen stove. It takes 3-4 minutes to heat up. I usually leave it on medium heat to heat up and just leave it on medium. I have researched extensively and I have concluded that soap does not really hurt cast iron. I wash mine with soap and it is still nonstick. I also purchased the Lodge plastic scrapers that I really like.I also like frying things in cast iron. The oil seems to hold its temperature really well which may be why things turn out more crispy than in a regular skillet.

I bought the 13.25 inch size and it's  just what I want.  The pan is heavy, so the person at Amazon needs to be retrained in packing.  The packing job was bad, as part of the handle was sticking out of the box, but no damage to the pan so I'm happy.  Like I said, this pan is HEAVY.  It's nice and flat and just the right size for me.  Lodge is made in America too!  Well made and I'll pass it down to my daughter when I bite the dust. Secondary small handle is good to have.  5 stars as this is a really nice cast iron skillet.  Spend the time to season it properly and it will outlive you and make cooking much more pleasurable.

  I have an induction cook top that makes an annoying buzzing or cycling sound with my magnetic stainless steel cookware. I was advised that cast iron pans would eliminate this noise. I'm so glad that I took the advice and bought this pan! I now have noise free cooking and the best tasting food I've ever cooked. I fry up eggs and bread on weekend mornings and the whole family raves about them. Crunchy on the outside, light on the inside. I rarely use the toaster now because bread and bagels taste so much better fried in this pan. This pan gets a perfectly even heat and which is easy to quickly control with an induction cook top. I have seared meat for stews and made stir fries in this pan, and it also works well for making sauces as well. At first I was a little intimidated by the cleaning instructions and the need to keep a coat of oil on the pan to keep it non-stick and rust free. But I have found the cleanup to be extremely easy. I simply clean the pan with the scrubber side of a damp sponge (no soap), rinse it out with clean hot water, dry it well and then apply a thin coat of coconut oil with a paper towel. I bought the scrubber brush and plastic scrapers that are recommended with this pan but haven't found a need to use them.

  A cast iron skillet is an age-old tool and a must-have for any cooking enthusiast. We purchased our Lodge specifically for outdoor cooking and we fell in love with it immediately.The design of the skillet is no-nonsense. There are no fancy gimmicks or tricks up its sleeve, and none are needed. It's just the right size to cook for two people. It comes pre-seasoned, which was great because our past attempts to season a vintage skillet did not work out. This bad boy was ready to go right out of the box.The extra handle and pour spout made it easy to pour juices, melted butter, etc over the food we made. Everything cooked perfectly due to the fantastic heat distribution of the iron. So far, we have prepared steaks, potatoes, bacon and mushrooms in it with amazing results. It is easy to clean, but follow the included instructions to ensure a long and fulfilling relationship with your skillet.This is a simple, solid and reliable skillet. I can't imagine campfire cooking with anything else, and look forward to many more adventures and amazing meals.

  I wanted to try cooking on cast iron for a long time now, but I was always worried and intimidated by the large heavy pans. This little guy is cheap but high quality, so it's low risk to try it out and see. It's perfect size for a lot of things, like cooking meat for two (we've tried steaks, burgers, chicken, and bacon) or making a quick full meal for one person (excellent for grilled cheese!). It was easy to use and easy to clean. We like it so much, we've now taken the plunge to get a larger cast iron pan for bigger meals. I'm totally recommending this one for other beginner cooks!

    Great Little Skillet for Making Chocolate Chip Cookie Dessert

  After having the Pizookie and similar chocolate chip cookie desserts at restaurants, I was on the hunt to find a little cast iron skillet to make the same dessert at home. This little skillet works perfectly! Just add chocolate chip cookie dough to the pan, bake the cookie, and then add a scoop of vanilla ice cream and hot fudge. It’s a great once in a while treat! The cookie cooks evenly and has the perfect consistency.

  I already had a 12” cast iron skillet (another brand) but wanted a second one, so I bought this Lodge skillet because of its low price and reputation. Sadly, it is a dud. I seasoned it as per Lodge instructions. The first use was OK, but the second one proved disastrous. I cooked marinated skirt steak, the meat came out great but there are tons of black bits crusted on the pan and I can’t get them out. I cooked a second batch of the same exact meat in my other skillet, no black bits, no problem wiping it clean. I’m throwing out this Lodge pan and getting another one of the same brand that I had. Also, the red silicone handle cover is worse than useless, it’s downright dangerous. You think it will protect your hand, but it won’t! Use proper oven mitts.

  I put this on my wish list since I already bought the cover some time ago for another pan. Bought when the price dropped on a late late night. Anyway, this is the largest pan that lodge has, that has an accompanying cover. I can make large quick braises with it, as long as the braising liquid isn't too acidic. Also fantastic for oven roasting. Preheat pan in 450 oven, then place your items in the pan and turn on the broiler. It cooks from both sides with no flipping needed. Quick hot cook=juicy foods. You need a good insulator to pick up from the helper handle. The radiant heat goes through most oven gloves!

  I ordered this 13.25 inch Lodge skillet when it was on sale, and I'm glad I have it!  I have a 12-inch burner on my stove, and this skillet fits just right.  The 13.25 inch measure is across the top, and the sides slope inward so the bottom is 12 inches.  If you don't have a 12 inch burner, this is not the skillet for you - it will not heat properly on a smaller burner.  The first time I used it, there were several spots where my steel spatula snagged against little bumps on the cooking surface.  I took some 150 grit emery paper on a sanding block and sanded the bottom of the skillet for about 10 minutes.  I ended up with about 1 1/2 tablespoons of dust that I washed out, then generously oiled the skillet.  The next time I used it, the bottom seemed smoother, but not completely smooth like my old Wagner ware.  My spatula no longer snags anywhere.  Because of the size and weight of this pan, I leave it on the stovetop most of the time.  If I have to move it, I put it on a rack next to the stove, so I don't take a chance of chipping my granite counter with it.  I have to lift it with both hands.  I use it as a frying pan for breaded chicken and pork chops, as well as a griddle for pancakes, quesadillas, french toast, bacon, fried eggs, and anything else you can think of.  I'm looking forward to when we can have a party again, and plan to bake a humongous cornbread in it!  Bacon and sausage often leave residue stuck to the bottom, so to clean it I will pour in about a cup of water while it's hot,  then take it to the sink while still warm, and run hot water into it and scrub with a brush.  I put a dishcloth or dishtowel on the sink divider to protect it from scratches, and rest the skillet on that while washing.  No soap is needed most of the time.  Just don't leave it until it gets completely cold!  Wipe it dry, and use a paper towel to spread a little oil over the cooking surface.  Put it on the rack to completely dry.  Now I just have to figure out who gets it in my will!

  This is a great skillet. The benefits of cast iron are numerous and well known and Lodge knows cast iron. I use this for almost everything especially meats that must go from the range top to the oven and back again. The thing one must be aware of is the maintenance. The care and feeding of cast iron is not an easy thing and there are do's and don'ts to adhere to. I've been cooking with cast iron pans my whole life and didn't know all there was to know about ""seasoning"" until looking on line for recipes. Having said all that, it is totally worth the additional attention!

  Have been using it for two years since I purchased, and it's still wonderful. It's a little different to wash/care for than my previous cast iron pans, which let to a bit of rusting at the beginning as I got use to it. But now it's wonderful. Cooks wonderfully both on burners and in the oven; people with cheaper burners should beware that the weight of this pan is quite heavy.The reason I'm writing this review now is because my house got broken into a week back while I was home. Came down to confront the dude in the kitchen and, seeing that this was the first thing within reach, swung at him with it. I only hit him in the shoulder, but it sent him scrambling away with some visible damage. The pan survived without a scratch.So overall 5/5 stars. Cooks well, durable, and does more to prevent crime than my local municipal police force.

  I really wanted to love this pan after reading all the reviews, but I must have done something wrong that it failed the very first time I used it.  The day I received it, based on the instruction from Lodge's website, I used hot water to rinse it without soap, dried it completely using paper towel, and applied veggie oil.  I then put it on cook top, turned on heat to low, and slowly to high.  I then cracked an egg into it, and a few tomato slices.  I thought I followed every step correctly, but everything stuck on the pan.  It was super hard to clean.  I used a brush with nylon bristles, but in vain.  I then again followed instruction and boiled water for a few minutes, but the food still got stuck on the pan.  I tried boiling water three times and didn't help.  Very frustrated, I dried it and coated with oil.  I tried again the next morning with a Dutch baby pancake in the oven, and again was very sticky.  I wonder what I did wrong and how to fix it.  I emailed Lodge, but a week passed and I have not heard anything from them.  I had high hope on this pan and now super frustrated.

  Because of my wrist issues, I resisted getting a cast iron skillet for years. But a week a go, I was at the point of replacing my non-stick pans (again). So, I decided to give Lodge a try. I've cooked eggs, bacon, sausage and steak in it! Success! I got the crispy ends on eggs which I love. The iron skillet browns a steak beautifully. I was going to post a pic of my steak, but hey, I was hungry. I suggest letting the skillet warm up for a while. Washing the cast iron skillet was easily achieved. However,  the Lodge Cast Iron Skillet is heavy for me. Ahhhh, I will just live with it or get a wrist splint and increase PT.The instructions said to use more oil on the first few uses. So my breakfast had more oil than usual. I had eggs and sausage with rice. I plan to invest in more cast iron skillets. I plan to use the skillet daily. These baby is durable.

  I love cooking with cast iron and this product is no exception. It distributes heat evenly and is great for stovetop or oven cooking. The only downside is the cleanup. Be very careful cleaning, as water causes it to rust.  I recommend using a large grain salt and paper towels to wipe out the food as an alternative to cleaning with soap and water.We use ours in a variety of ways but our favorite is to cook a big wheel of brie cheese.Coat the wheel in olive oil. Put garlic and sliced cherry tomatoes on top. Cook at 325 degrees for 25-30 min. Do not cook at higher temp as brie will cook and you want it just to melt. Finish with chopped basil. Great with meat or crackers.

  This is my daily use skillet for my family of five.It came with a decent seasoning from the factory. However, I recommend a giving it a good one or two seasonings before using it for sticky foods (like frying eggs). With the rougher surface on these Lodge pans, it won't take too long to build up.I’m able to do steaks for the whole family, deep dish pizzas and of course, big breakfasts.It’s well finished and consistent with Lodge quality. The only challenge that I have with it is that it is thick and heavy. The short handle makes it unwieldy so you need 2 hands to move it around. You definitely need a good, consistent heat source to keep it warm enough as well.If you need a larger skillet, the price and quality make this well worth it. Just be prepared to work with it’s weight.

  So I don’t usually write reviews, but I also get real annoyed with the “only buy USA made crowd, because Chinese made us crap” crowd, so I just needed to review this particular USA made Lodge skillet to assure them that some products made here aren’t so well done either.I ordered the Rosie The Riveter skillet from Lodge because I have a special affinity for the gals who rolled up their sleeves and went to work in what was normally men-dominated fields when their country needed them to. I don’t usually buy anything “special edition,” because it’s not special, there are thousands made, but having spent some real time with various Rosies, this one was near and dear to me.Came out of the package great, no worries about it being shipped. I took off the label that sits attached to the interior of the pan and was honestly a little shocked by what I saw—massive (for cast iron) pits in the center of the pan. I mean, these are legit holes in the cast iron itself, not just the seasoning.I’ve got many cast iron pieces, most of them I’ve gotten secondhand or they’re enameled, but never have I seen one with actual holes on the cooking surface. The bottom of the pan looks great, and i were just planning on hanging it up and making it a conversation piece that would be fine, but I also expect it to function properly as cookware so this was super disappointing.

  It's not often you can find something that just works as intended, will last a lifetime, and at a good price.  There may be lighter ones out there, or some kind of better ""design"" like a double spout, whatever - save yourself some time and just go with the reliable standard - Lodge.  Their YouTube videos are also very informative.  But you have to learn how to maintain and season a cast iron pan if you're looking at cast iron - there is no skipping that part.  But once you get the hang of it you'll wonder how you ever cooked without one.  We use ours both in the kitchen and out camping.

  I love cast iron products in general and I had high expectations for this skillet. The pros are basically what most cast iron products offer: evenly heated surface that cooks meat/eggs thoroughly, nonstick surface when seasoned, great with slow cooking.However, I noticed that this skillets handle is quite short when comparing to some of my other skillets. Combined with the weight of this item, I find it extremely difficult to maneuver. I also purchased a rubber handle protector that’s suppose to help with gripping the handle during cooling, but guess what, the handle does not fit properly and it’s hard to safely (without burning your hand) lift the skillet.I strongly recommend that the handle to be extended, or provide a better sleeve (to be included with the product, not only sold separately) that fits properly so you can actually lift the skillet during cooking.

  Came with a sizeable hole in the bottom of the pan, perhaps from a bit of sand in the casting process?

In addition the ""pre-seasoning"" was flaking off in chunks, and there were bits of burnt charcoal chunks stuck to the pan, presumably ""seasoning"" that wasn't applied properly, but I could have easily fixed both of those by stripping the seasoning and re-seasoning the pan. I own other Lodge cookware that I love. They make good products, but they don't seem to have any quality control.

  My wife has been using this skillet about 3 times a week since she got it. It came oiled & ready to use. She made some stove-top chicken with what they call smashed potatoes which was fantastic. Looked just as fantastic as it taste. I am amazed at all the recipes that are out there online. I think she got this one from Facebook but I assume Amazon probably has recipes somewhere on the site also for free. If I would have known she'd be getting one of these skillets, I would have went garage sailing more this summer since they're usually a buck or 2. I can tell you from a husbands point of view who's not the cooker in the family, guy's, if you are looking for a gift for your wife, get one. You won't be sorry. For you ladies reading this, it's great. You'll be amazed with what you can cook with it & the recipes out there are nothing short of fantastic. I'll post another review with a photo this week I had to fix the errors on this review because I was calling it a pan & not a skillet. I just ordered her a 12 inch skillet with 8 egg/pancake rings I might as well get those accessories since she'll be doing Sunday morning breakfasts again. The egg rings do help you make the eggs all uniform. With our 18 inch X 12 inch electric skillet, she'll be able to cook 8 eggs at a time, which helps out, plus it helps you make a restaurant style egg, without any broken yokes or egg runs where it looks like one gigantic egg, at least when I am elected to cook that's what usually happens. As for using the Egg Rings for Pancakes, our favorite server at our neighborhood restaurant told us that if we can't get the Real Restaurant Pancake Mix, use Sprite or 7-Up in the place of water, when we make our Pancake Mix. Not only will they have a sweet taste but they'll be nice and fluffy too. One more thing, if you like to cook outside on a grill over a log fire out on the pit, there's nothing around that beats a cast iron skillet. Those Teflon coated skillets warp so easy, they can get ruined after just one meal made outdoors & you now how good food taste's when you cook over an open fire.....Dan

  I purchased 2 of these mainly because of the reviews and price of the item with such high reviews. I'm definitely glad I decided to purchase these! I made the mistake of putting oil in the skillet during my first use as I read that cast-iron skillets need extra oil in the beginning. I learned my lesson the hard way! I either had too much oil or didn't use the right kind because my house was really smoky and the quality of the pork chops was not as good as the ones I cooked with the other skillet that did not have extra oil.These are very heavy and sturdy for paying a little over $20 per skillet. They do not feel flimsy and are very secure. I would recommend making sure you have another pot older for the handle as the skillet does get very hot and an accidental burn over something that could have been prevented would be no fun!

  Have wanted a cast iron pan for a long time, finally got it and it’s a disappointment. There were scrapes all over after the second use, used only silicone utensils and cleaned it with damp paper towel, so I couldn’t scrape it. It just cracked. It heats up so much that even the silicone holder doesn’t help, you still can’t touch it. Really heavy and not comfortable in use.

  Compared this Skillet to other Lodge products I own and the surface is different.  It's minutely dimpled.  I think Lodge started using this when they pre-seasoned their cast iron.  I believe the dimpling is much better in reducing sticking.  Amazing that this American company has resisted ""the China"" syndrome and continues to produce a superior product at a competitive price.  Also this pan is $5 less on Amazon than at Walmart.  This is really a good deal.

  This is my first cast iron pan. I use it almost exclusively for many different types of food. It is easy to clean, it heats evenly, and it has held up well. Make sure to dry the pan completely and oil it after use. Do not set it on a drying rack and leave it because it may rust. The 10 1/2 inch pan fits a one dish meal for two adults.Most people opt for non stick pans because they think cast iron is intimidating or too much work, but non stick is actually more temperamental. You have to use special utensils, you have to wash it carefully, and the non stick coating quickly wears out and you have to replace the pan.With cast iron, if you keep it oiled properly, it gets easier to clean instead of wearing out.

  I had a cast iron pan a long time ago and after one move, it must have disappeared and by the time I noticed I decided I really didn't need it.  Lately, I've been coming across a lot of recipes for which a cast-iron pan is ideal, so I decided to buy this one.  It heats very evenly, its easy to clean and the silicon handle works as long as you don't exceed what it's rated for.  I'm very happy with it, and as a bonus it gives my right arm a workout just taking it out of the cabinet, ""washing"" it, and putting it back.

  Our household kitchen wizard has been requesting a larger cast iron skillet for a while now, and this does the job just fine and dandy!  Does need to be re-seasoned, but not a problem; pretty much expect that with any cast iron product.  Pretty sure that paying triple (or much, much, more) for a more highly rated pre-seasoned pan is really not worth it.  What - you can't buy some flaxseed oil and turn on the oven for a bit for under $60?Price is right, product is what it is, a nice cast-iron pan, and the shipping was astronomically speedy to boot!

  I bought the 13in Lodge skillet and I love it. It’s heavy and you’ll probably want to get silicone covers for the handles. It’s very heavy. I have a ceramic cook top so I’m careful to not slide the skillet around on the stove. I haven’t had any scratches but I’ve read it’s possible on these stove tops.I feel like an idiot for not trying cast iron sooner. I cook eggs a ton and I thought it couldn’t be done well in cast iron. I was wrong. I can tilt this pan and slide my eggs out most of the time. It does require some prep to get to this level of non-stick though.When the pan arrived I covered it in the thinnest layer of canola oil I could and baked it at 400F for an hour. Over several days I did this 7 times. Some say that’s overkill but my skillet is hella non-stick now. Just make sure to use oil/butter to cook sticky foods like eggs and wipe the pan out while it’s still warm. Always dry it completely as it will rust quickly, but rust can be removed from these fairly easily.

  This guy was my first foray into cast iron cooking, and I am 100% hooked. This skillet is super solid (read: quite heavy) and reasonably pre-seasoned. The pre-seasoning was a little uneven, with some obvious pooling on the handle which led to dark splotching. I ended up giving it a very light wash and re-seasoning it before use. It's been a joy to cook with - no sticking at all, and so easy to wipe clean. This is built to last, and definitely will with the right care.

  I have to say this will be the first negative review I’m leaving on Amazon. I’m well aware not everything will be perfect through mail, but the packaging on these products was atrocious. Not only was there absolutely no packing materials between the two CAST IRON pans but there was barely any in the box. There’s a small scratch on the larger pan because the smaller one was sitting inside of it and probably rubbing the edges onto the other. The box didn’t look sturdy enough for a small rug let alone two roughly 10lb pans. Otherwise the pans are beautiful they look well made and very sturdy considering they held up in the cardboard box it was sent in. Will review the other pan good or bad if I have any issues or positive comments to make. Giving it a 4 because I’m unsure if this is an amazon mess up or the seller, don’t want to see a company have a bad review if it’s not even their fault.

  While I've had good luck with the smaller diameter Lodge brand iron skilets in the past, this 15"" model proved to be an EPIC failure. I'm definitely 'old-school', so I've bought, seasoned and utilized these older types of cast iron skilets for well over 60-years, but we repeatedly seasoned and used this one, and it was just a doissster. The quality of the cast iron on this model is dismal! Its way too porous and low-grade. In addition, the heat distribution was pathetic out to the outer margins of the pan. In fact, on only its third use (and at moderate stovetop heat), while making routine fajitas, the very center of the pan overheated, with the metal becoming molten and it literally SAGGED! Absolute fifty-dollars worth of garbage! We have four other Lodge brand cast iron skilrts of smaller diameter, and NONE of them have shown this type of failure. And cleaning it? A virtual nightmare! So I would recommend opting for another brand, or at a minimum, I would suggest avoidance of this largest (15"") skilet in favor of two smaller ones.

  Awesome skillet! No complaints. It's a larger pan so if you're looking to cook two eggs it might be a little overkill. Two 1lb New York strips fit perfectly with room to spare for some aromatics. There's some reviews talking about food sticking and sending the pan back because of that. I took the time to season this pan twice before I ever attempted to put food into it. The steaks didn't stick and cooked just fine. The mashed potatoes stuck some but I fully expected that to happen. Afterwards during cleaning it flaked right off and barely required any scrubbing. I fully expect this pan to last well beyond my life time and will be given to my kids who will probably throw them in the back of the cupboard, oh well. For $40 it's a helluva deal for a brand new piece. Without a doubt I'll be buying a smaller size for smaller breakfast type stuff. Again take the time to understand how to use cast iron and how to care for it and you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for instant gratification, stick with something teflon coated.

  NOTE: I received nothing of value for this review and paid full retail price for this item.I have the 12"" Lodge skillet that I use for lots of things but it's often too big. I'm very happy with this smaller, commemorative skillet. They really last forever.CAST IRON COOKING TIPS: It takes the iron a long time to heat up! Rarely would I use more than medium heat: give it time, it will heat up. I set the pan on the stove 10+ minutes with oil in the bottom to preheat. Once properly preheated, it cooks very evenly. When I'm finished, while the pan is still hot, I wipe it out and then scrub it out with more oil, then rinse oil off when cool. Rarely needs seasoning this way.

  This is a key pan for home cooking. Core cook wear is stainless but over the last 3+ months the need for cast iron became obvious. This pan is made in the USA by a long term manufacturer and is an exceptional buy at the Amazon price point. Caution is required in use and emphasized by the manufacturer for electric induction flat top stoves. It heats well, note the handle heats up as well, and holds the temp. Great utility for going from stove top to oven in cooking as well as direct baking. Recommend d/l mfg guidance from the Net on use and maintenance. Re-seasoned before first use. Clean up 4 out of 5 depending on use. Use hot water and stiff brush for cleaning after use with oil wipe.

  I was a little skeptical about how well this skillet would work for the price, but I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised with my first cast iron cookware. I took the steps to “season” it once by adding some oil and baking in the oven for about an hour. I also did as others have suggested and made sure to add oil when heating up and heating slowly. The first couple uses the skillet was a little sticky, but after that it has been great. Good even cooking and easy clean up. I make sure I always scrape it right afterwards under hot water and avoid using soap. Couldn’t be happier with the quality of this cast iron skillet for the price.

  I read a lot of reviews of these. I grew up on a cast-iron pan house, and cooked a lot of moosemeat in one. But I was a kid then, and really didn't have a clue one from another. So when I read the reviews, I decided to give it a shot. I wanted something I could make single-serving egg dishes in for myself. Well, I LOVE this. It is, indeed, rough (not smooth) on the inside, but I have a feeling that this is a GOOD thing. It comes pre-seasoned (vegetable oil), and I seasoned it before first use with canola oil. I rubbed it, heated it, and threw it in the oven to keep it clean. Then I baked something, and left it in there. Finally I used it for scrambled eggs. NOTHING STUCK to the pan! Then I got brave and cooked a cheese and jalepeno omelette. NOTHING STUCK to the pan! In fact, I can put a 3-egg and cheese mix in the pan, let it set on a medium burner for a few minutes, put the stainless steel/walnut spatula (sold on Amazon) under it, flip it intact, turn off the heat, then just flip the pan over and drop it out onto a plate. NOTHING STICKS! And I cannot say that for my older teflon pan from a big-name anodized aluminum maker. At all.So when you wash it, use a plastic brush and warm water... not even hot. Then rub a little vegetable oil on it, and put it into the oven and let it reside there the next time you bake. OR just heat it on the burner and let it smoke.BIG TIP FOR CAST IRON AND STAINLESS PANS: Let them heat up BEFORE you add any cooking oil as you first start to cook. Things will not stick. If you add things to a cold pan, they will very likely give you problems.

  I've recently gotten back into using Cast Iron.  I got a good deal on this one as a ""scratch and dent"" / Amazon Return.  I'm not sure where the scratch or dent is / was, but it works like it should.One thing to keep in mind is that this thing is HUGE.  No really, it's bigger than you were thinking.  That poses two ""problems"" for the average kitchen user, that aren't reasons to take stars away.1)  This is heavy and (like all Lodge cast iron) has a tiny handle.  You'll want to use two hands to move it around once it's hot and is full.  Fortunately it has a second handle.  Be sure to use oven mitts, welding gloves, or something else to protect your hands, because once it is hot, it is going to STAY hot for a while.2) Did I mention it's HUGE?!  So big in fact that the burners on my kitchen stove don't heat the entire pan very well.  You'll want to spend some time (5-10 minutes at least) pre-heating this on a medium low setting before cranking up the heat, and even then you'll probably have a hot spot in the middle, and cooler temps out at the edges.  This isn't an issue if you're cooking over a large burner camping / expedition type stove, but burner size should be factored in.

  Once I finally got this correctly seasoned, the pan is amazing. There is a lot of conflicting information on how to season cast iron in general, with what seems like a bunch of ""science"" explanations that are BS. After reviewing various instructions online and trying a few things, here is exactly what I did to finally get it right:1. by hand, sand the pan down using 220 grit sand paper. Just to get the major bumps off, probably 50% of the bottom of the pan was still black when I finished. Many people say not to sand cast iron as a mirror finish won't take seasoning well, but it would appear that higher end pans have additional processing done after casting such as machining or polishing/sanding. Lodge doesn't seem to do anything to the pan other than season it after it is cast, so my sanding probably brought it down to similar roughness to higher end pans.1. Rubbed with a light coating of bacon grease and let sit upside down in a 400 degree oven for 30 minutes. This resulted in an even, sticky amber coating on the pan.2. Since the amber coating did not appear to be a fully formed season, I put it on the stovetop on high for a few minutes. The pan smoked a lot until the coating turned black. This was finally the season I was looking for.3. Let it cool then rubbed it with bacon grease again and just cooked it on the stove this time on high, for probably 20 minutes. Again, until it stopped smoking and the coating turned black. This was just to make the coating thicker.

I put a piece of salmon on mine with a nice layer of seasoning, and when I tried to flip the salmon, I lost the spice layer that had been face down, which pretty much ruined the meal. These are inexpensive and will last a lifetime, but if you're going to be cooking sautéed veggies, rice, or any kind of meat, you're going to wish that you had something nicer.

  What can I say? I am obsessed with this pan. I absolutely love it and I'm frustrated when I have forgotten to clean it right away because I can't immediately use it. I cook everything in this. Steak. Eggs. Veggies. Ragout. It's so versatile and I love being able to go from stovetop to oven without any real thought.Says it's pre-seasoned but that's a lie. No such thing as a pre-seasoned cast iron pan. I recommend using flax seed oil for a solid, shiny seasoning. It's really inexpensive at Walmart and I've barely used any of the bottle I bought despite having had this pan for months now (i bought it when I had a different pan I accidentally left behind at my old place of residence).I like that the other handle has finger loops, makes gripping it with a potholder much easier. I would still suggest getting a leather or silicone sleeve to cover the main handle for safety, just remember to remove it if you stick it in the oven.No complaints, this is a great product!

  Well I bought this five years ago and figured it’s probably time to write a review.  Up until last year it was my only pan. I cooked fish, pizza, sauces, meats, eggs etc.  About a year ago it started having sticking issues. I fought with it on and off trying to get it to reseason.  I finally fixed it yesterday and had scrambled eggs sliding around better than a nonstick panIssues: smoking is a problem, it heats up real hot and the oils you add start smoking. Sucks if you don’t have great ventilation which is us.  So I had a lot of trouble getting a reseason as I cant use the oven to do it without filling the house with burnt oil smell.  There doesn’t seem like to be a way around this unless you have a grill or good ventilationI used my charcoal grill fired up to 500f for three hours after scouring the pan and put on  thin layers of flax oil every 45 mins.  This morning it was better than our non stick pan which is definitely seeing its end of days after one year of use. So after five years it’s like brand new which is exciting.  That’s something you just can’t do with other pans.  I ha e no doubt it’ll last my lifetime as long as I don’t temperature shock it.

  Wife and I used this iron skillet for a camping trip in Mendocino, CA. this past 4th of July weekend. It worked great for cooking meat, bacon,  and eggs. Only thing that we didn’t like was the cleaning aspect of it because it was tough to scrub. We’re not sure if there was a specific technique or step that was needed prior to using the skillet such as pre-oiling the skillet before use. I think that would have been important to do before cooking on it. But overall, it served its purpose that weekend, and we will be using the same iron skillet in our next trip.

The problem with the hole is it is big enough to be noticeable, but small enough that you won't be able to get all the moisture out after washing, and may be a potential rust spot.Unfortunately, I live overseas so the effort of returning it for exchange is not worth the effort, but I don't know if I will order any more cast iron products I can't see first.

",5.0,Scorpio,"Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was looking to replace my Tramontina 14"" Nonstick Fry Pan which was getting old and the nonstick had lost it effectiveness after almost 8 years even though I used it only occasionally. I like a big pan for family meals or when you just need the room such as making multiple pancakes in the same pan. nonstick/teflon pans are simple to use but they are not made for high heat and the nonstick coat will only last for a few years then it needs to be replaced. I mainly use a large pan for braising or frying meats and vegetables and sometimes adding sauces to them once cooked, like when I cook chicken thighs until browned and then drain oil and add teriyaki sauce to finish the dish. I was going to get another nonstick pan but I have recently started using my Cast Iron pans more so I decided to get the 13.25"" Lodge Skillet at under $40 it is a fantastic deal. I was happy with the size, but beware it is a very heavy pan so my wife can only move it with two hands. Cast iron requires care and knowing how to wash and prevent staining and rust, a few extra steps will keep it great shape and you will have a pan that last decades.I have also seen people doing extreme re-seasoning on these pans to make the sandy texture perfectly smooth on the cooking surface, they are stripping or sanding these pans down. My experience after using this pan for many meals is that it works Great, and there is no need to go to the trouble of resurfacing it. What I did was Wash the pan thoroughly when I received it with warm water and dish soap (this is the only time dish soap is required) and then put it on a medium flame to finish drying it for a few minutes, while it is still warm (carefully) add buzzywaxx or crisbee seasoning all over the pan in a (very very thin coat), put your pan in the oven for 1 hour at 400 degrees and let cool afterward in the oven for another hour, once the pan is cool put a very thin coat of canola oil on it, and your pan is ready to store or cook with! It should be nonstick for the most part but you have to some cooking skills to properly use the pan in accordance with the food your cooking. After cooking just use hot water and a soft brush to clean thoroughly, dry pan and heat on a medium heat until completely dry and let the pan cool then apply a very thin layer of canola oil before storing it.  I have cooked eggs, pancakes, meats with sauces, french fries, country potatoes, fajita steak etc... and I have had no problems with cooking or sticking, just great food and a pan that will last forever.

",5.0,Mary Mary,"Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2018","









  
  
    
  This is a great little cast-iron skillet. It heats evenly and quickly, and cleans up beautifully. The food doesn't stick to it at all.  I just seasoned it before using it the first time; and then, after each use, season it again with either olive or vegetable oil after washing and drying it. Seasoning, for those who are new to this, is just putting a small amount of oil inside the pan and spreading it around with a paper towel or napkin to give it a light coating...that's it.  The cast iron is fine on your Corelle cook top; it does not scratch or damage the cook top; I know because that is the cook top I have.  This 6-1/2 inch size is perfect for 1 or 2 eggs, a toasted cheese sandwich, a pork chop, etc., or for cooking and sauteing things to be added to other dishes you may be preparing. I couldn't be happier with this Lodge iron skillet. I bought this small size to give cooking with an iron skillet a try, and now I am sold on them. I plan to buy another in the 10"" or larger size but will only buy the Lodge because it has proven to be great for me.  There is a hint of iron taste at first, but that is one of the reasons for an iron skillet - adding iron to your diet. That taste has dissipated with use, though, but you still have that iron added to your food.  Price: Amazon always has the best prices. I don't think this is returnable though. You may want to check that if you prefer that option.  At the price I paid as an add-on item of a little over $8, I wasn't concerned about that.  Happy I bought it.

I suppose I will be returning this and buying something that I can see before I actually purchase. The surface needs to be smooth and I am not sure if that is something that happens over time or if it should be smooth to begin with.

  Nothing made of cast iron heats evenly, and you do have to be careful when you clean and dry cast iron cookware.  That said, I oiled and baked mine a few times when I first got it, and now it is virtually non-stick.  There is nothing like cast iron for baking cornbread and I can sear anything in it beautifully once it heats up.  I prefer it to a non-stick skillet for bacon and eggs in the morning, it will sear pork chops beautifully, deglazes easily to make a great pan sauce, and it usually wipes clean with just a damp cloth.  I put it back on a burner or in the still warm oven after washing it to be sure it is dry and it stays in great shape.  It is the most versatile skillet I own.  You just need to work with the quirks that go with using cast iron.

    I cook almost everything in my Lodge Cast Iron Pan
  
",5.0,Eric Wentz,"Reviewed in the United States September 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  If you haven't already taken the leap into cast iron you should think about it.  First off the pan is cheap, durable and generally non-stick.  Does this mean nothing will stick to this pan?  No but if you have the right temperature and use the right amount of fat/oil when cooking and take care of this pan it will take care of you.  I would say this pan excels at proteins first and foremost.  I have cooked bacon, eggs and pancakes right after one another and nothing stuck to this pan.  I would say vegetables are also a favorite in this pan as well because of the great flavor this pan helps create through the oil and char you can achieve with this pan.If you are the type of person that cooks and then puts the pans in the sink for a later time then cast iron might not be for you but I have left this pan in a sink for a few hours or on the stove top overnight and cleaned the next day so it is worth a shot.  If you are the type of person who lets pans soak in water overnight or puts them immediately into a dishwasher for cleaning then this pan is definitely not for you unless you are willing to make an exception with this pan.Did I have immediate success with this pan right away?  No I didn't.  I had food stick and I had issues with cleaning the pan and reasoning the pan and had to look for advice on the internet to solve my issues because not many people use cast iron so I couldn't ask them.Some of my mistakes were simple ones to make as I have always used either stainless steel or non-stick pans.  I didn't wait long enough for the pan to heat up.  Take it easy and heat this pan up on medium before you start cooking.  Don't think this amount of iron will be hot in 5 minutes.  You may need to wait 15 minutes to get this pan heated evenly but I would say put the pan on the heat before you start your prep.  The next issue is using enough oil.  You don't need a ton of oil but you should use a healthy amount.  If you are frying then yea sure use a ton of oil but generally your food doesn't need to be swimming in oil but coat the bottom of the pan.  I would advise against using black pepper on your steak if searing.  The high temps will burn the pepper causing smoke and burnt flavor on your steak.  You are better off using just salt before cooking and fresh cracked pepper afterwards.  Acidic food like tomatoes are okay in the pan but make sure you have a well seasoned pan.  I would stay away from sauces but cut up tomatoes in the pan for your first few uses should be fine.  You need to build a good layer first before tackling sauces.  This pan excels at bacon and frying so if you are in the mood to do either this pan will be your best friend.  The pan is shallow so it isn't meant for deep frying but I have done fish and chicken where I had to flip and it worked great.Also take care of this pan.  Scrub it down with soap and water.  Yes you can use soap I do all the time but I also rinse thoroughly and dry immediately over heat and spread another thin, thin, thin layer of oil on it too.  Every other month or so I give it a good scrubbing and then apply a light coat of oil and stick in a 500 degree oven, upside-down for an hour or so and then turn off the oven and let it cool.  This adds additional seasoning to the pan.  You can overseason the pan which I have done and all I did was heat, scrub, wash which eliminated most of the excess seasoning.  A salt scrub can help as well or if you really are in the weeds you can get a more aggressive scour pad and remove all the seasoning and start from scratch.  Shouldn't take more than 30 minutes to strip and then dry.  The time in the oven will be what takes the most time but at that point its set and forget.  You just need multiple layers so it will need a lot of oven time like 6 hours or more depending on your diligence.The best advice is keep cooking and don't be afraid to experiment, keep the temperature lower than you think you need and don't rush the food it will be done when it is done.

  I love cast iron (as well as stainless steel) and I’ve finally tossed all of my Teflon aluminum non-stick pans. I trust Lodge stuff. Yes, these new lodge pans have a sandpaper like cooking surface (unlike smooth old milled out Wagner/Grissy) but that doesn’t mean they can’t be non-stick. I bought this new lodge last week and it is already non-stick. I fried eggs and made Swedish pancakes in it yesterday. The trick is to season the thing properly and cook at medium temperatures. I don’t trust the lodge pre-seasoning because it’s filmy and leaves residue. So I remove it using my ovens self clean process, then I wash the pan with soap, dry it, heat it, then start the seasoning process with cooking oils. 200 degrees then oil, wipe off, 450 degrees (or above whatever your oils smoke point is) for one hour, let cool, repeat and cook on medium heat. Hot pan cold oil.If you must have a smooth surface because you don’t like the scraping sound from your spatula touching the lodge, then there’s always that stripping pad and 5 inch stick-on sanding pads for your drill... less than 20 minutes of work and your lodge will be smooth as a baby’s boo boo.I have Wagner/Griswold old pans and the Lodge, at $8 to $25 on sale, is so worth it. The lodge can be non-stick and smooth at fraction of price with no wobble or spinning.

  This is a great 12"" cast iron skillet, but for one factor - the handle is too small - both too narrow and too short!! With something this heavy, even with the ""handle holder,"" it's very hard to lift hold and maneuver, especially when it's hot. Plus, no lid. If I'd had any history using cast iron ware, I would not have ordered this model.

  I have wanted a cast iron skillet for some time. I carefully read about each one before choosing and am so glad I went with Lodge. After reading about the history of it, I knew it had to be the right one. It's a great pan, I am still working on getting it seasoned but I am really enjoying it. Even thought I read that most recipes are for 10"" I felt the 12"" would be best for me since I often have guests. I really don't think it will be difficult to adjust the recipes, just a change in length of cooking time.

  Doing a lot of home cooking lately, and many recipes recommend using a cast iron skillet.  Decided to give it a try and checked Amazon to see what was available.  Saw this 10.25” Lodge being sold for $15 and ordered one.  Glad I did, it has become my go-to pan for most of my cooking and frying.  This is a heavy well made heat holding skillet.  Yes, many of the negative things you read about Cast Iron cookware are true; it’s heavy, requires seasoning,  specific washing, and maintenance before storing.  But to me the pans performance makes it all well worth it.  Once you get into caring for C I it becomes second nature.This pan comes pre-seasoned, but I gave it two hot oven seasoning sessions before it was put to work.  Then first uses were for frying chicken, bacon, and then french fries which helped to build on the initial coatings. You can find a lot of good info online regarding caring for, and cooking on C I.  Don’t be concerned about this pans stippled finish.  When  you apply a couple of initial seasoning coats the finish doesn’t have any effect at all on your cooking.  I highly recommend this skillet.

  You can't go wrong with Lodge. I see a lot of comments about people getting upset about rust, but honestly I think a lot of that comes from not knowing how to properly care for cast iron. I know people get huffy and say they know what they are doing, but they usually don't. This little pan is awesome. We did a skillet cookie and it cooked evenly and perfectly. I seasoned it when it first came and have used it several times since, it it still has a beautiful black sheen. Don't bother buying cast iron if you are not going to do the research of properly caring for it.

  Comes  pre-seasoned, ready to use after a light washing. I especially like the side handle so it can be handled more safely than my antique cast iron skillet with one handle only. After I sauteed chicken in the skillet (overcooked it, too), I had to soak it overnight.  Then after washing and drying it, noted a few rust spots.  No problem -- just spritzed a bit of cooking oil and rubbed it all around both inside and outside, wiped it dry with a paper towel, and voila! Ready to hang up 'til next use.  Couldn't be easier than that. I have the 12"" skillet also, but will be gifting that to my daughter, as it's really too heavy for me to handle.

  This cast iron skillet keeps the temperature high, great for searing protein(I made fried fish with it, and it works perfectly). The thing you need to remember is that before adding oil and meat, you will need to preheat the skillet. It came pre-seasoned so less maintenance required, however you still need to clean it up right after it cools down and dry it on the stove before storing it. It can be a little bit high maintenance.

  I purchased this skillet and then immediately fell down the rabbit-hole of internet forums telling me that the surface would be too rough to be nonstick and I should have shelled out $$$ for antique skillets because everything new is awful.Seriously, don't listen to that noise.Do I wish this thing were a bit smoother? Sure. But truthfully, it doesn't seem to be making a big difference either way. Last night I cooked pancakes and tonight I fried an egg - nothing stuck. Nothing. As for quality, it is super heavy duty and came with no cracks, scratches or defects - you will not be disappointed in this regard. Also, notice that most of the bad reviews of this pan all happened around the same time with the same complaint - it was just a bad batch, and it was a long time ago. Seriously, this is a quality product.Have reasonable expectations. This is not Teflon and you absolutely need to use some sort of oil while cooking with it. (actually, I always found that to be the case with Teflon as well - but hopefully you get my meaning.) But, with a thin layer of oil this thing will perform as hoped. (And seriously, don't fear oil - dietary fat is not generally bad for you like we were once led to believe. Certainly not in the quantities needed to make this pan work wonders.)Edited to add: if this is your first time trying to achieve a non-stick cooking experience without non-stick (teflon) cookware, do a bit of googling around because there is a method to make it work. You have to first heat the pan to the correct temperature (so that water dances across the surface - not sizzling (too cool) or instant evaporation (too hot)) and THEN add the oil, and then the food. With foods like eggs or chicken breasts, you have to then leave them alone for a while... if you attempt to flip too early, it will stick. When the food is cooked sufficiently on that side it will ""let go."" Experiment and don't give up too soon!

  I just got it today. First, I seasoned it again because someone online said the preseason is for stain resistance, not non-sticky.  The process is as follow. Spoiling water to get rid of possible unknown residual.  Then, used baking soda to wash it thoroughly. Next, using a wet tissue to clean it. I found out that the tissue turned dark brown during wiping. I used three tissues to wipe until the tissue turn yellow then almost no color after. Last. I used a dry tissue to dip some oil to cover outside and inside, put it into oven, 450F,  heat for 1 hour. It was ready to use. Second, I put some oil in, put some dumpling in it to fry. It was very nice, tasted better than my nonstick pan. After that, I cut several pieces of pork, just have some salt and white pepper on, put it into the Skillet. The taste was very good. I fried scrambled eggs after, and it was not sticky at all. I like it very much.Of course, It is not as non-sticky as  nonstick pan, but it is healthier.

  I bought this skillet a little while ago and I was surprised how rough the surface finish was. It felt like sandpaper. Given all the positive reviews, I was expecting higher quality. After some research I found instructional videos on how to grind these Lodge skillets smooth, but who has time for that? I found two other American producers of cast iron that come with a smooth finish right out of the box: Stargazer and Finex. The Finex looks interesting but I went with the Stargazer because it's fully machined at half the price. Seems like I made the right call. The design is great, the surface finish is super smooth, and it cooks like a champ. If you're reading this review, do yourself a favor and pass on the Lodge. Go with the Stargazer instead. It's well worth the investment.

  Great product. I almost did not buy it because I thought it too was small to be usefel. I bought it along with the Lodge 2-Quart Serving Pot because the same lid fits both. I have been pleasantly surprised. I have used it often. After careful seasoning after receiving it has become my go to pan for sunny side up eggs for 1 or 2. I heat it slowly while I cook my breakfast potatoes in my 12 inch Lodge. Spray liberally with cooking spray and put in 2 to 4 eggs and cover. A few minutes later over a low heat you have 2-4 perfect eggs. I often do omelets in it!This 8 inch is perfect for cornbread. A recipe with 1 cup of flour/cornmeal or just cornmeal fits pefectly.  I usually do two at a time. I just got my third 8 inch skillet. I will be using all 3 at once for an upcoming family function.1 cup cornmeal, 1 tsp baking powder, 1 tsp baking soda, 1/2 tsp salt, 1 Tbs sugar. 1 cup buttermilk, 1 egg, 2 Tbs oil. Preheat the skillet with the oven. Melt a couple of Tbs of butter in the skillet. Spray with cooking spray. In the oven at 400 for about 25 minutes or a little less. Let cool in the skillet for at least half an hour. Some cheese and green chilies in the batter are optional, but a good addition.As with all iron: Always PREHEAT!!. That is even more important than seasoning to limit sticking. Even though it comes with some seasoning give it at least 2 coats of additional seasoning. Never cook at too high a temperature unless you need to sear.For most dinner dishes I transfer the food into a serving dish and wash the piece with hot water and a brush andget it into an oven preheated to 425 degrees. I turn the oven off and eat. By the time it cools the piece or pieces are dry and sterile and the hardest cleanup done before I take my first bite of dinner.

  Update 7/11/2020:Still love this little pan! After only a few times cooking with it, it became well-seasoned. Didn't have to season it in the oven. As long as I have a little bit of fat coating it, my egg doesn't stick no matter how high the cooking temp. I've used it nearly every day for months. <3The only thing I'd improve upon it is to lengthen the handle. It's very short, so using an oven mit is unweildy. I don't handle the pan when hot, because if this. I just use a spatula or fork to carefully lift food from it.Original review:This pan is the perfect size for one fried egg (with some cheese and an English muffin, you've got the basic fixings of a great breakfast sandwich). Used it for the first time this morning. It heated quickly and evenly comparable to a non-stick pan of similar size. For reference, I cook my eggs over hard. I used butter as a grease/fat and though there was some egg stuck to the bottom when I flipped it despite the good coating of butter, I think I only need to cook it at a slightly slower and lower setting to avoid that the next time. Even so, the egg was easy to flip with a small rubber spatula.

  We use this pan for everything except eggs. We've had this one for quite a while now so I feel like i can give a longer term review. The biggest thing I don't like about this pan is that it didn't feel like it came sufficiently pre- seasoned, so we looked up some videos and instructions and did it. Now it feels like the more we use the pan the better it gets. My husband and I both just Love this thing. The only thing it doesn't seem to cook right is eggs. There seems to be a bit of a learning curve when it comes to cast iron, but once you figure it out, it's very enjoyable to cook on and the food comes out delicious.Tips on how we seasoned it: there are lots of opinions on which oil to use but we just went with plain ole vegetable oil. We made sure the pan was clean, then covered it with a thin layer of oil. We put it in the oven as preheated it until 475 degrees. Once it came to temperature, we turned it off and just let the pan sit in there until it cooled. The goal is to ""burn off"" the oil, so bring it past the smoking point until it gets dry and hard on the pan. That's what makes it coat well. We did this 3 or 4 times, but the more you use it the better nonstick surface you'll have.Tips: Don't wash with soap, it'll strip it. We purchased a chainmail scrubber that we love to use. Seems to help smooth it out a little too, but that might be in my head. When I clean it I only use the scrubber and hot water. The more I use the pan the easier it gets to clean.When you finish cleaning it, don't leave it wet. It'll rust. We just put it back on the stove with the burner on until it's dry. Easy.Keep in mind that cast iron doesn't exactly heat evenly, but it holds heat well. This just means that you have to sufficiently preheat the pan before you use to ensure even cooking.Overall I love this pan! It just gets better every time I use it.

  This is a quality item.  In all honesty, this is my first cast iron pan.  Wanted to move away from non-stick pans as much as possible as I suspect the chemicals that cook into your food over time aren't meant for humans in the longer run.  Anyway, this cooks so differently than what I've always been used to.  Things don't burn as easily as they do with a non-stick and everything cooks very evenly.  Cleanup is easy and you can use soap but I've taken to filling the pan with water and leaving it on the stove for a few hours before gently cleaning it.

  After using very expensive hard-anodized skillets for years (so that I didn't have to use butter or oil), they started to fail. When I went to get a replacement because they were guaranteed for 10 years, or life depending on who I asked, I was asked if I had been using oil and subsequently told that even though they were hard-anodized and didn't require oil, I should have been doing so. For health/ nutrition reasons, I had started to use ghee about two years ago so I did some more research and decided to throw away the hard-anodized (since it didn't stand up to what it says it does) and try cast iron.This is the second Lodge skillet I've purchased. With the first, I didn't know what I was doing and I struggled. Food stuck and clean up was a nightmare. Since I no longer had the hard-anodized to fall back on, I decided to really try with the new cast iron skillet (this one) by following recommendations I read on several websites for seasoning and cleaning (including buying a stainless steel enmeshed silicone sponge, scrapers and a scrub brush).Now, everything is great!! Food no longer sticks (although some things do still leave a little residue, e.g., scrambled eggs and salmon) and clean up is a breeze. I seasoned both skillets (bought the cast iron oil, which is really just flax seed oil I think, and put them through 5 seasoning cycles) and try to use both regularly. I clean them by rinsing with warm water immediately after cooking using the stainless steel sponge or brush; initially I was afraid the food would get cold, but the skillets clean in no time. Then I dry them well and put them back onto the stove top or in the oven to let the residual heat dry off any remaining moisture (I've read that rust can be a problem).The skillets do get hot and they hold the heat really well, so I've had to learn to cook a little differently, but nothing has burned, yet anyway. I do use a little ghee every time and try to make sure that I get it into and up on the edges as it melts. The red silicone handle that comes with the skillet is great at protecting my hand from the heat although I am careful to have another potholder nearby.When transferring the skillets to the sink to clean, this skillet is easily managed with one hand, but the original one I bought, which is larger, can wobble a bit due to its weight so two hands are needed.I know this is long, but I was so afraid of cast iron before really learning about it and wanted to share my experience to help anyone else thinking the same.I'm so glad I made the switch. From what I've read, it should get easier and easier to use as time goes by. It's my belief that's it's a healthier way to cook as well... and the browning on things like breakfast sausages is amazingly delicious!!!

Also cast iron can sear things that teflon pans fail miserably at.  I have actually burned food in cast iron because you don't need it as hot as teflon pans most of the time

  My sister said this company makes really good cast iron wear at reasonable prices.  I washed with soap & water and oiled before using per the instructions.  EPIC FAIL!  Everything stuck to the pan.  Actually had to transfer the food to a different pan so I wouldn't waste the food (salmon).  Also, I saw a ""chip"" (?) as you can see in the picture.  Will see if I can return or have it replaced.  So disappointed!

  cast iron will never go out of style, the hear retention in cast iron is amazing and the searing and browning is to perfection and with the larger 12'' surface area for certain types of cooking it unbeatable, but here's one warning about this pan... this is a 12'' cast iron pan... its VERY heavy... You go into it knowing that... so if you want to use this pan to pick up and pour things out of it can be challenging because of the size and weigh. It dose have a helper handle on the opposite end of the pan but if you need a free hand to scrape or push out what ever you have in the pan then you may need the help of another person. And being that its iron you don't want to wash it with soap and you should oil it after every use to keep the seasoning. I usually spritz the pan with some natural non-stick cooking spray or coconut oil, wipe the excess with a paper towel and store it in the oven, but like I initially said, this is cast iron so you go into it understanding certain things the for lifting and pouring in particular you may want to use another pan for that meal

  I tried cast iron about 20 years ago when it all came unseasoned and I could never quite nail the seasoning thing. Gave it all away but decided to try it again now that it comes pre seasoned. Love it this time around. Got this skillet and did do a bit of extra seasoning to it (flaxseed oil/500 degrees/1 hour/twice) and then decided to give it a whirl - fried chicken with milk gravy made from the drippings. It came out perfect, the ""brown stuff"" left by the chicken lifted right off when I made the gravy, come clean up time I simply rinsed the pan under hot water and gave it a quick scrub with a brush. Done and clean. Wiped it dry and wiped it with some oil. Done and ready for the next meal. I am absolutely blown away and will be purchasing additional pieces of cast iron in the future.

  When our very old generic cast iron pan broke ( a chunk of the side dramatically popped off!) we immediately went to the dependable Lodge cast iron products for a replacement. Along with a very reasonable price we were able to take it out of the box, wipe it down and use it as it was preseasoned. Of course repeated use will fine tune the surface, but it is holding up well to daily use and is lighter in weight that our old generic pan which is better for my arthritic hands. Perfect!

    The Pre-Seasoning Works! Don't forget to buy a silicone handle!
  
",5.0,Vince,"Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2016","









  
  
    
  I finally got serious about cooking my steaks and bought this Lodge cast-iron. As you may already know cast-iron pans require seasoning before use where oil is heated on the iron at such a high temperature that it eventually adheres to the iron itself, providing a non-stick surface that won't peel off like the teflon in non-stick pans.Like you, I read most of the highly rated reviews before buying it, including the one by ""joe bob"" from Florida. He noted that he cleaned it with a bit of soap before using it and the egg he tested with it stuck. I was worried that the pre-seasoning wouldn't be substantial enough after reading his review and that I'd have to re-season it myself. This wasn't the case. I used a good bit of vegetable oil and cooked an egg on it just fine without sticking. So don't worry! The seasoning on the pan is more than adequate. However, I still use a small non-stick pan for my eggs and the lodge for pretty much everything else because I find it easier to flip my eggs and don't want to use such a big heavy pan for one egg.Since getting the pan I've cooked steaks with a crust that I though I could only get on my grill. I've taken the pan camping where I tossed it on the fire to cook bacon, sausage, chili etc. and I've grown to love how tough this thing is and how well it cooks. One drawback however, is that there is a bit more work in cleaning the pan than I'd like. I usually put a bit of sea salt and water in the pan and scrub with a plastic brush then dry with paper towels before rubbing a bit of oil on it to store. The only other drawback is that I had to buy the lodge silicone handle for $6-7 so I could pick up this guy while its hot.

  I wanted to get away from PFAS laden teflon so I went back to the basics - cast iron - for my eggs every morning.  This is the perfect size.  I read another review that said they can't get eggs to come out right on this and I am thoroughly confused.  My eggs are perfect every morning.  You do need to use enough oil, especially at the beginning, and make sure it seasons appropriately.  The description says it is pre-seasoned but I find that it takes a few months to really get good.  I still use a small amount of oil every day but much less than I used at the beginning.  Overall this is exactly what I was looking for and I love it!

",3.0,Matthew Brown,"Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2014","









  
  
    
  This Lodge is a decent pan, though it has some issues. Like other reviewers, I found that the initial black coating was uneven, or applied weirdly in some areas. Secondly, the interior of the pan is WAY too rough to be truly non-stick. The idea of non-stick cast iron comes from the interior finish being smooth and seasoned. I've felt Lodge pans wherever I go, and they are ALL very rough on the interior. I took the roughness down with 120 grit then 220 grit sandpaper, then seasoned it twice, and now it's easy to use and works well. But this took me over two hours to sand alone.In the end, I'd opt for a vintage, turn of the century pan like a Wagner on eBay...you'll pay a bit more for it, but it will be truly non-stick, and you'll most likely be eating off a pan that cooked a meal for some burly pioneer dude.

  Very nice!  I had not cooked on one of these since I was a kid.  It arrived and while the one-pound weight sounds kind of light, the pan is anything but that.  Good, heavy, solid, well-made.  Very impressive.  The gripper opposite the handle is a nice touch - not something my original pan had.Made in the USA - always nice.  As far as cooking goes, the pan does heat up quickly so exercise caution there.  I don't think I need the level of heat other pans require.  The pan retains the heat.  Even after I turned off the burner, the pan remained quite warm for awhile.  I would say it provides very even heating.  Of course, the handle gets quite warm and you'll need a holder but not a big a deal and certainly not scorching hot.  You wouldn't want to carry the pan around for very long without a holder, though.I cooked some potatoes, sausage, onions, and the like.  I obtained the right browning desired.  It seems to be great for that.This is 10-1/4"" by 2"" so this takes up slightly more than the large burner on an electric stove.  Just the right size and the tall sides keep food in place while turning over the food.  The bottom is very flat making for good contact with the coils.Cleanup was a snap.  I may well expand my collection based upon this experience.

  I figured out the joys of cast iron cooking way too late in my life.  I bought my first cast iron skillet over 30 years ago (Wagner's) and that thing never could get seasoned -- so I never used it and thought I'd never figured out the magic of cast iron.  On a lark, though, I bought a small 6"" Lodge skillet on clearance at a local store.  I fell in love with it and have been scooping up every Lodge skillet that I can find ever since.This is the latest addition to my collection.  I now have 5 Lodge skillets of varying sizes and I absolutely love every one of them.  Love the grip handle that comes with this one, too.I've seasoned all of these pans.  Others have said it and I will chime in:  do not use harsh soap or abrasives on these pans.  Wash in warm/hot water with a nylon scrubbie and just a squirt of mild dish soap and it's clean.  Sprinkle a bit of oil on it and wipe with a paper towel to keep it seasoned.FYI:  I've found that if you sprinkle with the oil that you normally cook with, it picks up that oil flavoring in your cooking.  That is, if you normally use the pan with olive oil, use olive oil to rub it with after cleaning; if you normally use canola or peanut oil, use those oils instead.These are the only skillets I use.  I had a full set of Revere Ware copper bottom skillets (with lids) in multiple sizes that I gave away because I never used them.  Lodge skillets are THAT good!

But it cost under $15.  The next best price on American cast iron is near, or just over, $100.  Take a little time to re-season the lodge and it, too, will be just as smooth.Lodge cookware, for most people, is ready to go out of the box (aside from an initial washing).  It's well made and it's durable.  And nobody comes close to the price.I have a cabinet full of Lodge cookware, and I have some of the higher end pieces.

  It came with the silicon heat resistant handle cover. Works okay if you are pushing the pan around on the burner. It really doesn't do the job for moving the pan or pouring off liquids/tipping contents into a another pot/container since the handle sort of rotates inside the holder.Since it came with the pan it isn't a huge deal. Would NOT recommend it as a solo purchase. Heat resistant gloves (or even oven mitts) would be a better purchase both for versatility and for the specific task.

I tested it the next day to cook chicken for a stir fry, and...I had some trouble with the chicken sticking, much to my dismay. I didn't give up, however, and went to make stir fry again the next day, and nothing stuck! Maybe it just had to be broken in a little, but I have had zero issues since and have used it for bacon, eggs, stir fry, burgers, mac and cheese, pancakes...It really is a jack-of-all-trades pan, and I like that I don't have to worry about damaging it like with teflon-coated pans!

  I wanted a big skillet, and this is definetly big.  I'd read some complaints about the rough interior of lodge pans, but it hasn't seemed to affect my cooking at all.  Compared to some higher end cast iron, it has a more pebbled surface, but that is just the remnant of the casting process.  I've been using my for a couple weeks, and it is building a nice seasoning.  I've had minimal stickingor burning so long as I'm cautious about how hot I keep the pan.One word of caution about this pan is that it is almost too big for a standard coil stove.  It will heat up, but you end up with an inner ""hot"" ring and an outer ""cool ring"".  You have to keep moving the food around.  It works much better on a larger outsider burner.  This would be perfect for an outside chicken fry.  This is simply because the pan hangs out over the coils by about 4 inches on either side.

I read the instructions and wash it with soap and water (even though I would never do that in a cast iron) and after scrubbing for more than 10 minutes I gave up. Worst quality ever.

  For the money - and it's made in the US - this is a great deal.  Heat is much more evenly distributed on cast iron skillets than other types of skillets and you'll notice the difference right away.  The heat-resistant rubber slip on handle cover is a nice touch (just be careful placing the skillet on the stove with this one so as not to burn it over the flame.... I speak from some slight experience...) I recommend this highly. I had a smaller one, and it was nice to find a larger size, especially at this price.

    For The $$$ - The Skillet Wins

  I have been looking for a skillet that was the perfect size for two people (enchiladas in an oversized skillet is no bueno). This cast iron dream is great, and for the price, you really cannot beat it. Super heavy duty. Make sure to season the skillet prior to use, as it will get rusty otherwise immediately after you use it. If you don't know how to season a skillet, here are some skillet seasoning skills I shall bestow upon you:-Scrub it in hot water with dish soap-Towel Dry (DO NOT AIR DRY)-Spray it with vegetable oil - just a little, enough to cover it-Wrap it in tin foil, turn upside down and onto the rack in your stove at 400 for 30 minutes-Let it cool-YOU ARE SEASONED!

Just make sure to follow directions for cleaning it... an get the chain cleaner it's perfect! DO NOT USE THE SILICON HANDLE WHEN COOKING AN LEAVE IT ON.. ive read other reviews an thats the #1 complaint... folks its a type of plastic... to use temporary to move the skillet around!

    Love It So Far

  I was raised by a dinner-from-the-box type of family, so cooking with cast iron was an entirely new concept for me. I do remember one of my grandparents cooking from one when I would visit, but didn't give it much thought. We recently just restocked our kitchen, from plates and flatware to non-stick pans. I decided to buy the Lodge 8"", 10 1/4"" and 6 1/2"" skillets along with the 10.5"" griddle about 10 days ago. So far, I love them all, though I use the 8-inch version the most. In fact, I find myself using these far more than the non-stick skillets we purchased around the same time.I've had no problems with rusting due to following instructions, which is always important. The more I use it, the better the food tastes. I also made an attempt to watch some how-to videos off YouTube, which helped tremendously as well (Alton Brown has some handy ones on there).When I first used these, food did stick quite a bit, despite using oil, so I decided to start applying oil after each use. I now am in the habit of rinsing/scrubbing when I'm done, I dry it down and then heat it back up on the stove as I apply a thin layer vegetable-based oil, which seems to make it more non-stick. Not a must-do sort of thing, since it's already pre-seasoned, but I'm loving the results. I don't do it long, just about a two minutes. It also helps me to ensure that everything's dry.

    3.5"" skillet's size is very small. Can fry just a single egg.

  3.5"" skillet's size is very small, diameter is  ~ 3.5"" at top, 2.5"" at bottom, height is 1"". Can fry just a single egg. Got measurements image from manufacturer's  website. Volume will be around 130-150 ml, I think. Bottom sits on a gas stove's burner, no need to keep holding. Compared to 

  










  
  
    
   Lodge 15 ounce (~420 ml) melting pot which seems not to sit on a gas stove's burner by itself, may be because of its shape. https://www.amazon.com/Lodge-LMP3-Melting-Pre-Seasoned-15-Ounce/dp/B0002CX9FE/ Measurements are for melting pot: diameter ~ top 5"", bottom 2.5"", height 2.5 "" as given at  manufacturer's  website.Edit added: For a small cast iron skillet,  seems Lodge 5"" ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LJSETWM/ )  or Lodge 6.5"" ( https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00063RWT8/ ) are better options, as the volume will be bigger than this tiny 3.5""  skillet.

  The first time I used it, I washed it well, and dried it . Put it in the cabinet. The next morning it had red rust all over the pan. So reseasoned it, and baked it In oven . Now it is fine. You would think it would have been season alot better that this from the manufacturer.  I do not recommend this product.
