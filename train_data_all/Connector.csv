  The Best & fastest  Ethernet cable !Well, before I have no ideal of CAT8 and never heard about it .  After I got this one .I plan to upgrade my network to gigabytes station  & smart householdCompare with the old yellow CAT5 ,the cable was shielded and each pair was also shielded per CAT8 spec and there was a grounding wire.After I test it via FLUKE, you can see the performance is really fantastic .Insertion Loss is tiny , brand-with is big , have to say , it support 40Gbps 2000Mhz High Speed Gigabit  and its SPEC really meet everyone’s requirements .Works very fast and steady with my iMac 2019 . To improve the best experience I’ve called COMCAST and now upgrade to a Xfinity 1000Mbps package ,The wire is well-made and easy to manipulate not being to stiff but still thick durable material. The main feature that I mentioned before that is my favorite part is the durable head piece connector which is the main piece that has given me problems in the passed breaking or becoming unusable.Meanwhile the outdoor material jacket of cable is tough enough for the daily use .

  I have an area with lots of known 60hz interference, no reasonable way around it. Shielded cabling seems to be the answer. This one works great! But, the fun doesn't end there. This isn't one of those crappy cables that you have to pray doesn't fall apart as soon as you leave. This thing is built to last. It's flexible, and solidly built. Did you have too much to drink at the last Christmas party and break all of your patch cables swinging through the warehouse like Tarzan? Have all the egg nog you want, this cable will still work perfectly.

  I upgraded to this cord from a CAT 6 cable. I use it to connect my tv to the router. There was a noticeable difference in the sound quality while streaming video. There was a slight improvement in video. This is comparing CAT 6 to this one.The cord is a little stiff,which is understandable with all the insulation on the wires. The cord is round.Good value for the money!

  The cables appear to be of high quality and I’ve had no issues attaining some of the faster speeds that cat8 cable allows for. However, I haven’t tried pushing the cable to the limits.The shielding is good and the connectors snap in firmly. The gold plating around the edge of the connectors is gimmicky, though, but it looks cool and might help you differentiate these cables from others.

  It's awesome!  So far as I can tell. I just wish I had the electrical testing laboratory available to verify the quality,  like I had in the calibration lab I worked at in the Air Force.  I cannot see any issues, and everything seems of a better quality, and construction, than anything you would be able to purchase locally, or would be installed, or provided by local technicians.  Much, much better than what was installed at my property (not included the ruggedized cable buried underground).  For anything above ground, inside, and outside this is the ""gold standard"" for installation of services and perfect for gaming, and general home use, in my opinion.

  I bought these to improve the stability of my internet usage. There wasn't any issues with my existing cords, but...I wanted to see if investing in new, top of the line cords would make it even better. The moment I started using these cords (hardwired into my PC) I experienced severe packet loss - something you're not suppose to have with a wired connection, and I never had before. So I am returning these cords ASAP. Glad it worked for everyone else, but it was worthless for me. Disappointed.

I’m a novice & it made absolute sense to change out all of my old Ethernet cables — the one from the modem to our WiFi router, and (2) from my child’s PS4 & computer that connect to our WiFi router

  Bought this around April 2020 to support working from home during the COVID shutdown. Speeds seem to be up to the specs claimed by the manufacturer from what I have tested. The cable itself and the gold plated connector seems durable, but the clip for securing the connector to the target device (PC, router, etc.) is made of an absurdly cheap plastic. It broke in < 1 week during light indoor use at home. Most Ethernet cables have the plastic clip, but I've never seen one snap off that easily.Still gets the job done so long as the cable isn't disturbed, which for my WFH setup is fine, but be aware. Seems like an odd yet annoying component to skimp out on.

  We had some home wi-fi issues in our house and long story short:  a sharp Comcast techie explained some internet and wi-fi things to me via chat and phone, of which I was not aware.  Ignorance is no excuse.  One of several issues was down/up speeds to my Xbox One X, via our gateway, and then via the old cable from my Xfinity pod.  So, I upgraded my ethernet cable from one I'd owned for something like 6 years, to this one.  Bingo!  This Cat8 effectively trebled my down/up speeds via our Xfinity gateway to the console, via the pod.  Great value purchase IMO, based on some great advice.  Bottom line?  If you're having some speed issues in-house, check to see (1) if your device's interactions may be faster via a cable, and (2) if your cable needs to be updated to a 2020 version.  And a big Thanks to everyone that helped me with this!!

  Recently I bought a 10gbe card setup for 2 of my computers. My machines are a bit distant from each other and there are live AC power cables in the way. I am well aware that 40gb/s is a bit overkill, but at the same time, I know that AC electromagnetic radiation can interfere with a lot of things.The main selling point for why I got this product was 3 things:1. The insane amount of shielding and protection it has. It's way better than your typical CAT6 or CAT5e cable. (You can tell due to the thickness and the stiffness)2. I needed a cable that is capable of handling a 10gbe transmission speed. I could have gone with CAT6, for sure, but at the same time, 10gb/s is the ""maximum"" that CAT6 supports up to. There's no guarantee that I would ever ""see"" the full bandwidth of 10gb/s.3. The price. This cable is super cheap, I was surprised! While the available overhead is quite much, yes, the good thing I can say is this: ""At least I'm prepared for USB4!""While I cannot confirm or deny that this cable can handle 40gb/s data transfer rate speeds, I CAN confirm that it handles a full 10gb/s transfer speeds, for sure! When 40gbe network cards come out (or become cheap enough that they're more affordable by the consumer market), I'll update the review and tell you my findings!

  I am not sold on cat 8 cables after my experience with these cables. They are stiff and because of that they have a tendency to hold my router at an angle and not flat on the table. The biggest gripe however is that my old cat 5 cables out performed them in a speed test - not once but every time I tried. I’m using my old cables - these are going in my spare parts box for an emergency.

  So I purchased these along with 8k HDMI cables for my then PS4. I tested speeds and they were great once the cables were updated. I have since switched them to my PS5and re tested and I was getting speeds of 812 plus and I pay for 100 mpbs, so that a great improvement. The picture is fantastic and the wifi is supercharged, no lag or buffering on my Firestick wired and my other connected via wifi on the second floor. For this price they are well made and feel like good quality and they work. So with the combo of the cat* and 8k cables streaming and gaming are great now.

",5.0,Rais,"Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have very fast internet (250 Mbps) but I kept getting lags while I was streaming. I did a little research and I came to the realization that my ethernet cables were the cause. Once I replaced the ethernet cable connecting my modem to my router, and my router to my PS4, things instantly changed. For most people, Cat7 cables would be enough, but I like future-proofing everything so I got Cat8. Keep in mind that Cat8 cables are good for small spaces like apartments but not so much for large spaces like estates. So If you're planning on installing ethernet cables on acres then Cat7 is the way to go.

  I currently have AT&T internet and I have the Fiber package which gives me about 1G of internet speed in my area. I personally never had an issue with the WIFI signal on any of my devices or TVs for streaming. However, when I got the new PS5 I just wanted the best experience I could get with the console and the 4K 120 native FPS TV I have. I noticed the slower download speed when downloading digital games and when playing COD Cold War public multiplayer matches. I checked the PS5 internet connection system for WIFI signal and download/upload speeds. Even though I technically had 1G internet and the router was unobstructed and high up for better signal coverage what the PS5 was getting was about 360 download speeds and 60 uploads. This was noticeable in COD and other online games as there would be connection issues and lag. After I bought this 25FT Ethernet cable and set it up to my router I restarted my PS5 and now I consistently get about 990 downloads with about 470 upload speeds. A drastic change over WIFI alone. This makes a difference when gaming online as I have a stable internet connection a low PING. Personally, I recommend this to any serious console or PC gamer forget about a good headphone set they are useless if you are lagging all over the place and have long wait times. Overall, anyone who is looking to gain an increase in the internet connection for either console, PC, TV, or other compatible devices will benefit from buying this cable assuming you have a decent internet plan to start with. Obviously, this ethernet cable can't turn for example a max of 100mbps internet plan into 1G internet speed that is up to you and what you are willing to pay for a month/offered in your area.

  I was a bit skeptical about the CAT8 type cable but decided to try it after some research.

Just by replacing the old CAT6 w/ the new CAT8 Ethernet cable to connect both caused my internet speed to noticeably improve. That affected my desktop connected via Ethernet cable and also all WI-FI devices on my network as well. I wish I had purchased this sooner.

  The wire out if the bag is thick, well made and looks durable. I have a HP Laptop and have 5G Wi-Fi connected to it, I wanted an Ethernet cord to get the best out of my 5G Spectrum service as I have 1 level under the fastest Spectrum offers Residentially. I feel I'm better off with the Wi-Fi as I didn't see a big difference in speed, the only thing good is download speeds is quick and uploads. As for streaming on websites on browsers 4K is slow and sinus the 1444K settings which I think is a smaller tlrate within 4k? I will buy a MacBook Pro soon and see if it's this laptop as I am fully customizing the Mac to it's best settings.

The jacket quality is decent. The foil wraping is so thin you can tear it if your not careful. The same foil is around the pairs. The conductor size is very very small. 26 awg or less. I counted 8 individual strands of copper. This will not hold up. The jacket around the pairs is extremely thin as well. I bought these cable under the impression I was getting a heavy quality cable.

  I replaced the ""standard issue"" Cat5e cables that were provided by Verizon and 1-Voip with their hardware and saw an immediate increase in wifi speed and clarity with their respective services. Overkill? Yes, but actually a future-proof investment and for the price per each, totally worth it.

  This Ethernet cable appears to be like any others but it's in fact, CAT8.  Sometimes, the higher up you go, the more stiff the cable becomes.  This cable is still flexible and gets the job done.  Speed tests over 1Gb and 10Gb look great.  Haven't been able to test 40Gb with Base-T yet.

  I purchased 2 of these to connect my ps4 and my laptop both via ethernet so I could get the best connection. Well, I did not get the best or even close to what I should be getting with these cables. I have a 1000 Mbps(1GB) up and down connection. I only get 90 struggling when using these cables. The cables in the walls are cat6 and the connection is Fiber. I plugged in one of my trash cat5e cables from 2015 and I got 750Mbps consistently while with these supposed cat8 cables the speeds were consistently below 100Mbps. I def don't recommend these. Make the investment and buy from a trusted brand.

I will say the connection was amazing it was much faster and it was exactly the same speed I was getting from the main router. So I will say if your looking to improve your home connectivity. These are good investment for the future.

",1.0,Wesley Ritchie,"Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  there is no printed markings on the cable so I have no clue what this is? all ethernet cables have printed markings to define what it is wether its cat5e cat6 cat6a cat7 or cat8. (unless it is a braided cable in which its rating will be stamped on the flat spot of the ends) I have 3 different black cat7 ethernet cables 2 yellow ones an one white. the black ones have white print that has a serial number, MHz rating an cat7 every 12 inches and the white an yellow have black printing. but this cat 8 that I bought has no markings no print on it for all I know they are selling me something besides cat 8 because their is no printed proof an my speeds during test were lower then my cat 7

  I bought two of these ""Cat 8"" cables for the ethernet cable between my router and modem, and between the router and computer. The original cable between my modem and router was a Cat 5e cable that was provided for by the manufacturer of the router. The cable between my router and my computer is a Cat 6 cable from Best Buy. Before I installed both of these cables, I had no issues with streaming, playing video games, and other devices connected to the same network. After installing these two cables, I've had nothing but issues with these cables. They should NOT be sold on the market as Cat 8 standards as they feel stiff and very light as if there are no cables inside. You WILL get severe packet loss on this cables, will drop the connections to streams, at any moment. I've had these longer than the 30 day return policy. I thought it was my computer itself as I uninstalled all networking drivers, followed by reinstalling, and flashed the latest firmware onto the router. I wish I could return these cables as the manufacturer's words do not back up their product. The only words they provide is a FLUKE test that was most likely flawed.

    I'd give this more starts but, it's not necessary for any regular consumer
  
",3.0,Julian Uccetta,"Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  There is really absolutely no point to any consumer buying this cable for use in their home. Cat8 supports up to 25/40Gbps, much faster than any consumer router or even consumer internet supports. Remember: Getting a faster rated ethernet cable does not make your network any faster. Your network is only as fast as the slowest link in the chain. So if your router only handles 1gbps, thats all you are going to get. You'd be far better off saving money and buying a nice Cat6 or even Cat5e cable. Furthermore, Cat8 is not a recognized standard by ISO yet, they are working towards it but it's not a recognized standard yet. It has been ratified by ANSI though.All in all, this cable seems to be decent quality, good for fast networking if you have the switches to support it. I purchased this as a slightly cheaper alternative than other cabling for a 25gbps switch and so far it seems it can maintain the speed, though I purchased a short length of cable. I do not have a longer version of this cable to test and see if it can even reach the distance/speeds that Cat8 should provide according to ANSI.Tl;dr - do not buy this cable unless you have network gear capable of 25 to 40gbps. If you are an average consumer, pick a nice cat5e or cat6 cable. This wont make your Xbox multiplayer gaming any faster.

  Don't fall for scams like this. Gold-plated rj45 connectors don't do anything. The 8 individual wires in the inside of the connector is your conductors. Gold plating rj45 connectors is just for show and offers no benefit. It allows the company to over charge you for pointless crap.Residential networking has literally no need for a cable that can handle 40gbs.Cat6 can withstand 1-10gbs uplink that is plenty for any residential and commercial use and the best part is it is cheaper than dirt in bulk.Buy a rj45 crimp set, watch a 5 minute YouTube video and make your own cables.Again, cables like these are an absolute scam.-Data Center Technician.

  I bought this cable to hook up my ps5 to see if I'd get faster upload speeds then wifi. The the cable outpriformed cat6 cable I purchased at Walmart for $4 I get the same speeds as I do when hooked to wifi on the ps5. I feel it's due to the wifi6 in the ps5. I do only have the router that was supplied to me from Xfinity and understand that other factors can come into play when it comes to internet speeds. I only wanted to have less of a dip in upload speed to live stream in 4k instead of 1080p/30 when on wifi. In my opinion the cable is built very well and is very durable also. It did give me a solid 6mbps upload without the dip I'd get on wifi going down to 5.8 or so. I'd say this cable is good and did give me the fastest speed I can receive from the slowest speed that my network provides.

  I had never purchased anything above Cat 6 when I recently purchased Cat 8 cable from two different manufacturers.When it seemed that my speed was slower with this Cat 8 cable, I decided to test it. When the initial test confirmed my gut feeling, I decided to do a more rigorous test.For reference, I pay for a 1GB internet speed, so I expected to be limited by that. I compared my WiFi speed as well as Cat 5e, Cat 6, and two different brands of Cat 8For the test I plugged into the same port on the router supplied by my internet provider for each cable.I tested each cable, six times over two days, and eliminated the slowest recorded speed for each.The download results…  this Cat 8 cable was slowest, with results even slower than the Cat 5e by 10.5%The upload results were even worse. This Cat 8 cable was the slowest, with results even slower than the Cat 5e by 13.4%.In case the manufacturer is reading this, the reason I eliminated the slowest recorded speeds from each cable’s test results is because this cable also had the lowest recorded speeds between the Cat 5e, Cat 6 and the Cat 8 from the other manufacturer. I was trying to help this brand’s cable show better results, but it didn’t help.

  I have 1Gbps download speed internet. Before buying this ethernet, I never got close to 400Mbps download speed. It was frustrating because I thought that my internet provider wasn't providing what I am paying for . After getting this ethernet, my speed download is always above 900Mbps. I love using this ethernet because its steady with the upload speed which works perfectly with gamin.definitely  recommend this ethernet.

  Using the cable, I hooked up my Roku to my gigabit hardwire network , and the cable works well with a 4K TV. I am not  a gamer, so I could not rate the cable for gaming, but, seeing that the cable is rated at cat8 my guess is that it would work well.

  I bought this cable to direct connect my ps4. It is very fast with connection, it actually at times is able to up my download speed past my service that I pay for (50mb/s up to 70mb/s). My upload speeds almost tripled as well with this cable. Overall, very good investment to up your download and upload speeds.
