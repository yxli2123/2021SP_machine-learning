    Locking is shotty, opens too easily.
  
",2.0,Quinn,"Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2017","









  
  
    
  This was perfect in every way when I first got it.  After a few months, the locking mechanism got less and less effective to the point where it opened inside of the pocket and when I sat down it gave me a laceration that needed stitches.  The possible medical bills aren't worth the cheap cost of the knife.  I wish I could give a good review as I love the aesthetic of the product and it was useful when it was functional.

  I have never owned a pocket knife in my life, but after binging LNM on Reddit for awhile, I thought it time I took my safety seriously. So I got this knife with the Prime membership & boy am I obsessed with it. The blade is legitimately super sharp and means business. I love the rainbow, it looks incredible when it hits light just right. I got down the one-hand open / close in about 5 minutes, it does open and close fast like the description stated. The bottle opener / screwdriver or glass breaker is such a nice perk to it. I hope I never have to use it to defend myself but if I do, I know I am in good hands with this product. Will recommend to others!!!

   I have to admit, I was ordering one for my bf and decided to order one for myself purely because of how beautiful it was lol it is a really good knife though. It’s easy to open, the blade it really sharp and also has a nice serrated part. I also like how it has a little clip so you can attach it to your bag or pants or whatever. I use it mainly to open boxes and stuff and it does a great job at that! I’m sure it can be used for many other tasks as well

  The knife is pretty, and it would probably be a sweet blade if it worked properly. Alas... The bottom of the blade is not properly aligned with the liner lock, and the lock will not snap into place when the blade is opened. This means the knife will not stay locked open, making it entirely likely that I will close it on my fingers if I make any attempt to use it. My fingers have done nothing to deserve this fate, therefore, I will not be using this knife. Unfortunately, I tossed it in a corner and forgot about it until it was too late to return it. Maybe I'll put it on display somewhere...First picture shows faulty locking mechanism. Second picture is just for you to admire its technicolor beauty. Disregard the scuff marks around the screws - I took it apart completely to see if I could fix the alignment myself. (Obviously, I could not.)

  My family loves camping and scouting, and as such, we use pocketknives frequently. Of the four of us who have a knife, three of us have this one, and we LOVE them! I've got the orange, and my two sons have the rainbow ones. The blade locks effectively, and if you take care of the knife - keep it clean, etc - it won't malfunction. I like the belt clip feature so that it doesn't slide around in my pocket or risk falling out - women's pockets are a JOKE, so this is really important to me. It's easy enough to open/close for children to use with proper supervision, and it holds up to vigorous use in the wilderness. We've used our knives for everything: whittling, carving, cutting off chunks of fat wood, even cutting potatoes and onions when the kitchen knives in our packs failed. I've used them to cut bandages for first aid, and so much more. Awesome, versatile, high quality knife. When my youngest gets his first pocketknife in a month or two, we'll be getting another one of these.

  First off, be careful because this is extremely sharp. I was playing with it when I first got it and cut my finger because I was not careful enough. So that is good point for sharpness of the knife.Easy to open (although I cannot personally do it one handed) but stays locked so it will not open accidentally.I've carried it in my purse for quite a long time and it's been super handy and convenient to have around for opening and cutting things when needed. Blade doesn't seem to have dulled noticeably either.I liked it enough to buy a replacement one when my idiot self accidentally left it in my purse and had it confiscated at the airport (oops). Ordered the new one as soon as I got home from my travels. (:The rainbow color is a nice option as well.

  I paid $7 for this knife and am absolutely blown away by its quality. Its NOT a $200 knife, but its every bit as nice as many $60 knives I've owned. Smooth to the touch, not exceptionally heavy (though slightly heavier than an expensive brand name.)The spring assisted opening is perfectly made, just tight enough not to pop open, but lose enough that it doesn't take a ton of effort to launch it when you want it.I cant say firmly enough how much nicer this knife is than anything else for even 5 times as much money.Improve: I'd love to have the bottle opener work with the knife closed. Or, even better would be to use it as a strap cutter with the knife blade inside it when closed. Would like some more color choices.But, if you've read this far: buy this knife. Its great, especially for the price.

  This knife which is under 15$ is your best option in this price range. I have had this knife for several months and the blade is just as sharp as the day I received it. It has a belt clip, a bottle opener and a glass breaker on the bottom of the handle. The stub on the side that is used to swing out the blade is extremely useful and fast. The weight of the knife is nice and lets us know this is not cheaply made, you are not losing quality and still spending a small amount of money for what you get. The blade always stays locked in and has not became loose over the several months I have had it. There is no hassle when using this knife, it is very dependable. This Tactical knife is ideal for any situation, it holds up and may surprise you on how well it holds up. I have used it to open boxes at my job to cutting rope on camping trips. Very convenient knife for whatever you may need it, not to mention the versatile colors that are available for the knife are incredible. Overall a bang for your buck and I recommend this knife without hesitation to anyone in search of one.

  I'm a woman with small hands, I can open it one-handed but not easily, needs practice. To close it, on the inside just below the blade, right on the curved serrated-like area, you just push down (meaning: with the blade at your left, sharp edge toward you, push the inside part 'downward' toward the ground. You can see how it goes up to the outer-blade area and 'releases' it). Then close with fingers while pushing down with thumb. I can't fully do this yet, I think my hands are a little too small. Anyway, the knife is weighty, seems pretty solid. And of course: it's truly lovely.

  I love this thing. All the positive reviews are spot on. It's got a great weight to it. Feels strong and sturdy. I've had it about 2 months now and I have had no issues. It was really stiff for awhile there. Hard to open and close one handed without breaking a nail...yes I broke a nail trying to open and close this knife. True story. But it seems to slowly be getting more loose where it opens and closes easier. But not loose loose...just getting broken in. It still takes a bit of effort to pop it open one handed. Then again I have small female hands. Over all, love this knife. Really sharp. Great size. 10-10 all around.

  Opens easily with a flick of the flipper one-handed. Blade color is beautiful. Feels sturdy but not heavy. No play in blade when locked . Lock has not failed to engage nor has it shown any tendency to disengage prematurely. Edge is sharp but not razor sharp. If you are one of those people that needs a blade that sharp then this is probably not the best choice. It is sharp though and the serrations are also quite sharp. Bottle opener is slightly more useful than the one on my CRKT Pryma. Haven't tried the glass breaker. A little harder to close one-handed but it can be done. Its just a little more awkward so not as smooth to close as it is to open. I am happy as a pig in sheet with this knife.

  I was really excited for my knife, only to realize that it was extremely hard to open. I know how to, but it made my fingers hurt alot because I had to press on the little mechanism IMMENSELY hard to open it. My fingers are still sore after not touching it for 12 hours. Also not to mention when I do get it to spring up, it doesn't even come up all the way and I have to lock it into place by hand. At first I thought I was doing it wrong or just weak but after watching videos and speaking to someone who has the same knife, I realized this is just a faulty product.

",4.0,Keri,"Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2016","









  
  
    
  Had this knife for nearly a year at this point. It's overall, a very good knife. I have used this knife for near daily, for smacking, cutting ripping, but primarily as a box cutter. Biggest issue, a week ago the screw came out of the bottom of the knife, did not come all the way out though. I'll have to wait until I can get a Hexwrench to see if I can get it back in. The bottle opener only functions when the knife is out. which seems really dangerous to open bottles with, although that didn't really stop me. The blade scratched, but held up pretty decently, and the color is still very vibrant.Also the blade has bent slightly, it was worse at one point but I have managed to getting back into shape for the most part. Decent. Good buy.PRO: Sturdy.cheap.pretty.cons:poorly placed bottle openerThe black paint on the grip wore off, very quickly. In under a month.

",2.0,Maverick Kucia,"Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2021","









  
  
    
  The knife on its own is flashy and cool. The handle has a fantasy quality and the blade itself a nice holographic.  I opened it and was pleased, until i actually touched it. The grip is somewhat uncomfortable with ridges in awkward places. The latch has smaller grip ridges on either side and is difficult to use if you have bigger fingers. In addition to that, i discovered it to be rather dull out of the box, and very difficult to sharpen due to the aforementioned unpleasant grip. The rainbow sheen proved to be impossible to keep clean: the slightest touch gives it an unattractive smudgey look, not to mention how easily it scratches off.  I suppose there was little better to expect, as i did buy a 10 dollar pocket knife, but i am nevertheless annoyed by the inconsistency of quality. A year or so ago i bought a TAC force knife, (black blade w/ faux wood handle) and it has served me very well! It needs to be sharpened a little more often than my higher-quality knifes, but other than has a very comfortable grip. Very disappointed with this more colorful purchase, howeverTl;dr overall, not a great knife. Awkward to hold, difficult to use, and you're better off saving your money for a better one

  So I haven't actually had an opportunity to put this to any actual use yet, but just based on general inspection and playing around with it this seems like a pretty nice knife, especially for the price. It has a nice weight to it, feels pretty balanced and nice in my hand (it's a little heavier in the handle than on the blade, the center of balance is a bit past the halfway point - which I like). The screws and hardware and such all look fine, nothing feels loose or doesn't work properly. It is a little bit stiff both opening and closing, personally I like the amount of resistance there is when opening it, it's not too hard to open (somehow a friend of mine - a grown male friend at that - had some issues with it and I ended up having to open it for him but he's kind of an idiot so I think he COULD'VE opened it but was doing something wrong? Even though I'm not sure WHAT you could actually do wrong, it's pretty straightforward...) but it's not so easy that it might come open when it brushes up against something; so as long as you don't have some sort of weird ragdoll fingers that can't press down on things you should be ok haha (I'm sure this could vary some between knives though, so if it WAS too hard to open you could probably either wd40 it or loosen up the blade screw ever so slightly). The lock is a little stiff as well, not horribly so, but I do find myself not pushing it QUITE far enough in and then having to adjust a little more to get the blade folded back in, which only takes an extra fraction of a second so again, not a big deal at all just slightly... not even annoying really, just barely notable enough for me to mention it - also there is still some resistance once you're fully clear of the locking mechanism so you may initially think you haven't fully pushed it aside but once you push down a little harder on the blade it'll fold up just fine.The blade itself is pretty sharp straight out of the box, I'll probably sharpen it some anyway around the tip because I like to keep my knives as sharp as possible at all times but this is by no means necessary, in fact I managed to put a little cut in my thumbnail when I was messing around with it haha and with little to no effort at that. Because of this as well as the price point and quality I think this would be a great 'starter knife', to carry around and try out as an edc to see if you even use it enough to warrant buying a sharpener or a more expensive knife. I also think it would also make a great gift, and you won't need to open the box and sharpen it before you give it to them (in fact I actually bought a second one for my friend).My final thought on this, and I'm sure you will see many other people mention this if you haven't already, is that this thing is SO gorgeous. I got the rainbow/oil slick color, and I knew it would look good just based on other reviewers' pictures, but still figured I'd bring it up because it's just so cool looking in person, everyone who's seen it has commented on it.Overall this is a great buy, I am so happy with it and I think anyone else would be too so I recommend this 100%. I don't really have much to add to what anyone else has already said about this so I'm really just agreeing with all the other people who loved this knife but I hope this was helpful regardless, and I hope everyone reading this has a great day!

  First off, it's cheap, so I halfway expected all of my following complaints.  Both arrived relatively sharp, but the first time I tried cutting rope with them they dulled almost instantly.  Cheaply built: made in china, and the rivet that acts as a pivot point for the blade came loose after a couple weeks.  Buy this if you want to cut yarn or string, don't expect a heavy duty knife... again, look how much it costs.  Also, the ""bottle opener""  has such a wide gap that it even fails at effectively opening bottles.  Looks good though.

  Full disclosure: I am no knife expert, or even a knife enthusiast. I'm sure someone with deeper knowledge could tell you why this isn't nearly as high-quality as an expensive one. That said, it certainly cuts boxes, slits tape and splits cable ties like a madman, and that's good enough for me. Does so at least as well as the Kershaw Brawler I stupidly lost and bought this to replace, in fact. Again, more of a ""knife guy"" could quite likely tell you why the Brawler justifies its considerably higher price... but for my purposes, the TF-705RB keeps up just fine.

  I just received my knife really fast which is awesome because I was told I would get it in 3-5 days but I got it in 2! I ordered it on a Thursday night & got it that Saturday afternoon. The box that the knife comes in is just a simple cardboard box, nothing fancy. But, when you open it & take the knife out you will definitely be impressed. It does not look or feel cheap at all. It looks & feels like a knife you would pay $30-50 for, in my opinion. At the top of the knife you'll notice a little piece that you push to open the knife. When I first tried it It stuck a little but after opening it a few times it flicks right open. It doesn't feel like it will get loose any time soon though but if it does you can just tighten it if you need to. Just like many other knives, under the blade there is a rigid piece that you push to the side to close the knife. On the back there is a clip so that you can clip your knife onto whatever you'd like to clip it on. I was really impressed with how sharp the knife is as well. Another reviewer said they would give the knife a 7/10 on sharpness & I agree. If there's is a con it would be that you can only use the bottle opener when the knife is open. That doesn't bother me but it might bother someone else. Just be cautious & you won't hurt yourself. There's also a part at the end of the knife that you would use if you need to break a window. Overall, I think this is a great buy. I loved it so much I bought my best friend one & now her dad wants one too. I can't wait to try it out when we hunt & fish. I would definitely recommend this knife & buy more TAC-Force products.

I know it says that this knife has a bottle opener on it, but be advised that the knife has to be opened to use the bottle opener. The bottle opener had no bearing on me getting this knife, and that it why it still gets 5 stars even with the unsafe bottle opener. Of course, like most knives these days, this knife is made China. Not the kind of knife you get to be a family heirloom, but a great inexpensive daily use pocket knife.

  Ok, this knife is just badass!  After seeing the videos about how quick and easy this opens, I had to order me one.  I chose the rainbow option because I've never owned a blade like it before and wanted it to stand out against the other ones I own.  The knife is super sharp and the serrated portion scares me to death!! I'm going to have no problem sawing limbs off small trees with that.  Or cutting through rope if need be.  I love the way it looks like some sort of alien technology.  However, that's where the only drawback (for me) this knife has as it's handle includes a bottle opener feature that when holding the knife, digs into my pinkie finger.  Should I ever need to use it in self-defense, I would have to use a reverse grip so that any strikes wouldn't cause me as much damage as my threat.  All in all, I'm extremely satisfied with my purchase!

  Very pleasantly surprised with this knife! Not only does it look totally badass, the spring assisted opening is awesome. After spending some time practicing opening it by swinging the blade out with my thumb, I noticed a small “button” protruding from the knife when it was closed. Whaddaya know? Press the button and the blade opens automatically. Surprise!Nice sharp blade, the serrated section is VERY sharp 😎And the price??? Come on, just get it. You won’t be disappointed!

    If you’re looking for a working class knife keep looking

  If you are looking for a working class blade, keep looking. I bought this to use at work while my benchmade is being serviced. I was not expecting anywhere near the same quality seeing as this is one of Amazons cheapest knives.However, here’s my take: the blade is solid and the weight of the knife is heavy. If you are someone who rarely uses a knife this is a fine selection. You can use it for many basic purposes.If you are a person who uses knives multiple times an hour to open boxes, cut zip ties, scrape away material, any type of industrial usage. This is not the blade for you. Do yourself a favor and get a benchmade. Yes they are over $200 but it has a lifetime blade sharpening and repair warranty. So it will pay for itself and always cut better than this $8 titanium.Again if you just want to look cool and occasionally open a box or something this is fine for you.

  Lost my old knife and wanted a quick cheap replacement. I always have a knife on me as they're often useful. This one came with even more uses. While the spring assisted rainbow blade is nice, I got it because it can also double as a glass breaker & a flathead screw driver, and lastly, a bottle opener!I'm no country hick because I drive a truck, I drive a truck because I see it more useful than a car. Same thing with the knife. I'll take something with more uses vs something shiny any day. The fancy rainbow blade is just a nice look & the knife is cheap but well worth it.

",4.0,Matthew G.,"Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2015","









  
  
    
  For the price, you can not go wrong. Out of the package it feels solid and is shave worthy. It is over light use though, when it starts to show it's character. First, the Rainbow blade is very shiny and pretty to look at, but that nice finish isn't going to stay flawless forever. I noticed quickly that the blade began to hold scratches and any kind of oil/fingerprint smudges, but with that said I didn't really buy the knife for it to be perfect all of the time. It gets the job done. Very cheap and reliable. As of construction, it has a nice weight to it.The blade feels very solid and the lock holds well. As for the handle/grip, there isn't much to say. For me I don't like the shape or feel of the grip. My hands get sweaty holding it for some reason, I don't know why. But that might just be me so no points on them. Also the screws in the grip were a concern from the beginning. They didn't feel like they were going to last very long and indeed I was right. Within a month or so one of the screws near the glass breaker was gone. Also a flaw but nothing I worry about too much. It still works fine. Again with the blade, it came very sharp. This shave worthy edge does not last long but is not hard to get back. The blade sharpens very easily but that can be a con as well depending on how you look at it.Overall, it is a great knife with decent construction and function. I just put in order for another for myself and one as a gift to my brother who just lost his $100 boot knife and loved mine for the idea of a decent knife for less than $10. I highly recommend.

  Pros: Looks like the picture, no scuffs or scratches. Very sharp and sleek looking. it’s got a nice comfortable weight & grip to it. It locks completely into place once opened. (I know some people had problems with the knife locking into place).Cons: It’s stiff. It takes some real pressure to push down on the spring action button thing 😂. Even if I try to just pull the knife out I have to use some force and that scares me because I don’t want my hand to slip or the knife to spring out by me using so much force and cut myself. Even the button to close the knife takes pressure to push aside. I’m going to oil it & see if that solves the problem. Or maybe the screws are too tight?

  For a ""Made in China"" knife, the blade, sharpness, lock, open-assist, and versatility of the TAC Force TF-705RB-MC is a pretty decent buy.  How well this stands the test of time and durability remains to be seen, but for the price I'm very pleased with my purchase.  I do not anticipate ultra-high use since I only camp once or twice per year, and fish / float from my kayak a few times more.

  The knife is pretty and springs open nicely. I was opening and closing it about 5 times when I got it today. Then it became VERY difficult to close. I wasn’t able to push the lock to the side to close it, and it was a little jammed. I saw some metal shavings fall off where the lock meets the back of the blade so I think mine needed to be filed a little more before it was assembled. I can still open it when I need to so that’s the important part. I do prefer knives that have an easier close though.

  Its a really good knife. The only 2 drawbacks are, it comes kinda sharp, but not very sharp. And idk about you guys but I ain't the knife sharpener guy, id probably just mess it up lol. So that sucks. But also the spring assist feature works well, but not all the time... I'd say about 1 in every 15 times you use it, it won't work. And those are decent odds, but when it comes down to life or death, you don't want any odds lol.. overall, for the price, this thing is really well designed, made decently, looks cool.

  Real cool knife. I enjoy flipping it in and out. Though, it's not sharp at all and you'll probably have to sharpen it yourself.Also, if you get the rainbow variant and you touch it a lot, the oils from your skin make the colors real dark.I think I actually like the darker colors anyways. More manly. Heh.**Edit** I just gave the rainbow knife to my girlfriend and bought the grey variant and I've noticed it's not quite as good mechanically. When I first received it, it wouldn't flip out all the way and lock.. so I had to loosen it up a bit. Still, it doesn't flip out quite as solidly as the rainbow one, most likely because of the paint. Still a good knife, though.

  Wanted a knife to carry in my purse. Bought the rainbow because it is girly enough without going overboard. Very sharp right out of the box. I like the feel in my hand. Only drawback is the single handed open. My husband has a Kabar with a nipple on the blade that allows you to flip the blade with your thumb, and I love that. This knife however has a nipple on the back of the blade that you drag back with a finger, then the blade pops open with the assist feature. So it does open very quickly. Shutting it is also somewhat of a challenge. It unlocks easily and shuts about halfway easily. The remaining halfway is more difficult and requires a good bit of force. I'm sure this is to prevent someone from inadvertently shutting their finger in it, but it makes me more scared that will happen because I'm struggling to close it. I feel like this will loosen up as time goes on though.Overall, would recommend.

  I’ve had this knife for a few days now, I haven’t really used it a lot, mostly have just opened other Amazon packages. It looks really nice, feels nice in the hand as well. The only issue with the knife is that the lock mechanism feels a bit sketchy. Sometimes I have a problem closing the knife but it hasn’t been much of a problem. If it does become an issue within the following months I might make an update but overall good quality for the price I paid. If you plan to use it for heavy duty work I’d recommend looking for something more effective but otherwise I still think it’s a good purchase.

  I love that these Knives have such color variety, and I had to get the rainbow blade! It doesn't come super sharp but it's not bent or seem to be used in any way. I know how to take care of a knife so I'll sharpen it myself. It flips just like it's supposed to and I like how I can get a firm grip on its handle. I'm a little unsure about using the bottle opener with how position right next to the tip of the blade because I don't want to dull the end of the knife. I don't know if I'll ever use the glass breaker but it's better to have and not need it than to need and not have.

  Now, let me say that this knife looks awesome, and it worked well for a while. It cut the way a knife was supposed to cut, the opening and closing was smooth, and it seemed like a great product.The problem is that it decided to loose some screws and basically fell apart.Now, it didn't phisically separate from the handle, but the handle will shift a solid 6cm. Now, I may not be an expert on knives, but I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to do that.In conclusion,  looks awesome, but may fall apart if you actually use it.

  Gibbs rule #9: ""Never go anywhere without a knife.""I bought the rainbow-hued TAC Force TF-705RB just for fun, but it is a pretty good knife. Although it looks like an oddball Klingon Bat'leth, the grip is surprisingly firm and comfortable. The blade has a nice edge, but the serrated section is freakin' wicked sharp.The TAC Force knife arrived in two days in a nice black box. When it arrived the hinge screw was a little too tight and opening the blade was a real fight. I loosened the screw a hair and now I can use the TAC Force as a flip knife.Note that the blade locks in the open position and you need to press an interior bar to close the knife. The clip is pretty useless, IMO, since it leaves part of the handle protruding from your pocket. Others will likely feel differently.But at the price, this is a real five star bargain.

  As far as my knife collection goes, this is the best one yet. I love the blade color and design and the flame shape of the handle makes it comfortable and natural to grip. The knife has a comfortable weight to it that's not too light nor too heavy. This also fits perfectly in my pocket and the clip keeps it very secure. Typically the clip is either too loose that it slips or so tight that you can't clip it to anything easily but this one is perfect resistance and has a high lip at the end which makes for easy pocketing. The blade was sharp right out of the box and the spring assist is strong. This is my favorite knife.

This knife is the perfect size for my purse, and is fairly sharp.This knife has a bottle opener, but you can't really use it unless the knife is open... seems poinless - and there's a ""window breaker"" on the end.  Haven't had to use that yet.I've used it for several months, and it seems to have kept it's edge.The only bad thing is that the rainbow-surface shows smudges easily.

  For a knife that's under $7, this is surprisingly quality. It's not too stiff or loose, and very sharp. I used it to open all my packages and cut a few zip ties right out of the box, and will be taking it backpacking soon. After that, it'll stay in my glove box for self defense purposes, since I work a graveyard shift.It's also very pretty, which is a nice touch.

  First out of the box, the knife smelled of sweatshop and grease. Knife was slippery and extremely sharp. After I figured out where the open lever was, I noticed just how big this knife was. The clip is very sturdy and latches onto anything and does not move. Blade doesn't wiggle when folded and it takes a bit to get it open so don't worry about it being in your pocket. Glass breaker on the rear of the handle takes a few hits to pop open a window and dulls quickly. Color is good, but I did get the wrong color. Overall, the knife smells funny for a bit, knife is huge in your pocket, glass breaker works twice, and it is incredibly sharp. 4/5

  Pretty good knife. It's very sharp so you'll have no problem cutting anything. Bottle opener is nice but you have to have the knife open to use it, obviously you should exercise sound judgement with that feature. After a year or so the locking mechanism became less secure but if you have the correct tools you may be able to correct it.

  I like to keep this on me for everyday use, and for my peace of mind when walking alone at night.This knife is spring-assisted, so you will have to apply a force on the hinge in order for the blade to flip out. You can fold it closed by pushing the lock (located beneath the blade) out of the way with your finger and carefully folding in the knife with your free hand. You might find it hard to open the blade the first few times - but I've found it becomes easier after having used it over time. Others might suggest you could use tools on it or apply a lubricant on the blade hinge, but do this at your own risk.The blade comes sharp out of the box, but can dull over time depending on how much you use it. Consider purchasing a blade sharpener depending on your usage of this.There's a clip on the side of the blade that allows you to slip it into your pocket or on your hip for a discrete carry. I do either from time-to-time, and sometimes I forget its even there because it fits so well. Knife comes with glass-breaker and bottle opener. Note that you cannot use the bottle opener unless the knife is unfolded, which might be somewhat unsafe.For hunting, or other ""heavy"" uses, I would recommend looking for something a bit more durable. Otherwise, I recommend this for general, everyday use.

  The prices on the TAC Force/MTech knives are so low that I have always thought they must be poor quality. Found this one in a local store and was pleasantly surprised at how solid, crisp and sharp it was. Bought it and then bought again on Amazon for half the price. Only one problem: the spring assist is a negative feature. The extra resistance that the spring makes necessary to hold the blade closed makes it harder, not easier, to open. The MTech version I bought at the store is not spring assisted and much easier to flip open one handed.

  I didn't expect anything more than a knife that looked cool, obviously because of the low price. Yes it's nowhere near the same quality as my other knives but then again it is 1/8 of the price which is why I am not disappointed. I was already aware that the bottle opener is extremely impractical because I read read quite a few reviews before I made my purchase so I wasn't disappointed at all. It is great quality for the price I paid but if you are looking for a knife to use on a daily basis you are one cheap son of a b****. This knife is to look cool and to use every once in awhile (you should be able to tell because of the price). Side note if your the type to loctite everything make sure you have a torx T6.

  The knife was up to standards that I had expected, and was tight and fairly sharpe, but with little effort was very sharpe and what little I used it I beleive it will hold an edge.  Considering the price and what I received in a timely manner ahead of time quoted I think it's a very good knife at a very low price.  If I lose,break, or someone walks off with it I won't be out a bunch of money, and if I need to abuse it I won't worry but will pry, chisel or unscrew with it,at the risk of breaking off the tip or snapping it in half,but with what labor cost verses knife cost if it saves a 1/2 hour of going after another tool break it!

The weight is nice as well giving the knife a real quality feel. I purchased the rainbow colored one and have gotten many comments on how cool it looks.

  I purchased this knife to add to my everday carry items (phone, wallet, keys). I wanted this knife primarily for protection and self defense. I am 18 and not of age to buy and conceal carry a handgun so I figured this was the next best thing. I don't know very much about knives, but this knife seems to be very sturdy and well made. It feels good in your hand. The spring assist does its job and alows the knife to be opened one-handed with relative ease. I have only one minor gripe about this knife and it is the placement of the glass breaker. When opening the knife it may poke your hand depending on the placement of your grip, but as I have said it is only minor because in order to avoid this you just have to adjust your grip slightly. I also really like the color of the blade. I was worried it might be a little too feminine, but I was wrong. It gives the knife a unique look that really stands out and looks great for either sex.PROS:CostLooksSolid ConstructionGood Spring AssistPerfect WeightFairly SharpCONS:Placement of glass breaker may poke the users hand (again, minor but worth noting)I only received the knife today so I cannot speak on how long it lasts, but based on everything that I observe I would be willing to bet it will last some time.

  I've ordered this twice, with very large gaps, and both times I was very satisfied. This one came with tiny scratches, but i can barely even notice them. They're not deep enough to feel them, either. I'd highly recommend this as it also seem to be good quality and the color, along with the price are some pros :)

  I got this for myself. This was a perfect compromise between looks and practicality. I'm very leery of how it flips open when using it one-handed, so I use a two hand open. But it opens smoothly and locks open well. The locking mechanism is easy to release. The knife came sharp. It has a nice heft and feel to it. Overall, I'm very happy with it.

  I didn't need another knife but I liked the look of this one.  Then I saw the reviews, then I saw the price!  Buying one at that point was a no brainer.  Even if it was crap, it was only $8.  When it arrived (I got the rainbow titanium one) I couldn't be happier!  The style and quality of this knife is as good or better than any knife I have purchased and a fraction of the price!  I plan to buy several more and keep one in my truck, bug out bag, and anywhere else I might need a good knife.  For the price you will not find a better or cooler looking knife.  Feels well made, looks great and all at basically a disposable price!

  Shipping: Pretty quick even as I live in Canada. Bubble lined envelope was used and the wrapping on the outside was good, inside the packaging tho not so much. This is more of the manufacturer's problem tho.Knife: Feels pretty solid in hand but not too heavy, screws are tight and blade is solidly mounted. The blade is shaped pretty well and the ""rainbow"" finish is evenly coated on. Opening mechanism is smooth and feels satisfying, closing lock is a bit hard to push away but still acceptable. Black anodizing on the body looks good but not very durable. It's not rubbing off per say but can be scratched fairly easily. Some how clipping it on my jeans induced a few scratches and then when I used it to open a bottle of beer it did a bit of damage as well. Doesn't bother me much but something to keep in mind for heavy duty users or perfectionist. Ergonomics are okay, certain holding positions are better as it has a curve to its handle. Main issue is probably factory defects, have 2 scratches right out of the box as well as a semi-rounded screw.Quick summeryPros: Looks cool  Solid feel  Smooth action  Sharpened bladeCons: Minor factory defects  OK ergonomics  Need to open blade to use bottle opener

   I have had this knife for almost a year now and I’m in love. It is still incredibly sharp and I only sharpen it every month or so. It opens easily but I’ve never had it accidentally open on me. The assist gets easier to use the longer you have it. I carry this knife every day and I use it about that often as well. I’m an extremely clumsy person and I drop it constantly (as you can tell from the pictures the paint chips off after dropping it about a hundred times) and I’m not light handed with it so it is extremely durable. I don’t see myself having to buy a new one anytime soon but if I ever lose it I’m definitely getting another one of these knives!

Has minor impurities in the handle on the blade, but nothing that would affect it. And for the price you can guess that it might. I love the blade though, have had 2 friends order it because theyve liked it so much.

  It is a lot better than I expected all the reviews on here about its being bad remember it’s a 10 dollar knife and it does it’s job perfectly, it’s extremely sharp so watch out I cut myself the first day I got it. The cut wasn’t deep but it just sliced my finger like there was nothing there no resistance at all, overall worth the money.

  Too big and too many gadgets for my taste for a pocket knife.  I keep my knife in the same pocket as my cell phone and this knife is just not a good combination.  Otherwise works really well.  A little too big for my taste to keep in a pocket so it's out by my toolbox for quick easy use when I'm out there.

  A little smaller than I expected, but looks great nonetheless. The rainbow finish is forged in, not coated or plated like some other colored blades, so I would expect it to last for a long time. Handle is either a hardened plastic or a lightweight metal, but feels sturdy. The only issue is a design flaw for the bottle opener where you would need to keep the blade in an open position to access it, which leaves your fingers susceptible to cutting while using it. Otherwise an excellent little knife for the price.

  These knives are great for such a cheap price.  I'm on my second one after beating the heck out of my old one at work for over a year.  I'm in grocery and don't always remember my ""safety cutter.""  In a pinch the glass-break on the end splits packing tape better than keys and I don't freak everyone out using the blade.  My 1st one didn't break, one of the screws came undone and I lost it. I'll be adding Locktite to my new one.

  I initially purchased this for a friend, but I ended up loving it so much that I had to get one for myself too! Not only is the blade beautiful, it's a great knife! The colors on the blade are just as vibrant as in the photo. It's sharp and has a good weight to it. I personally can't figure out how to open it one-handed, but I think that's more due to my weak baby hands than any fault of the knife. I've now had it for over a year and it hasn't failed me yet. I haven't tried to use either the bottle opener or the glass breaker, so I can't speak for those.

  I've had this knife for approximately two months and it has held up fairly well. Two of the torx screws that keep the knife together have fallen out at some point but I have replaced them with two phillips screws that fit. This isn't a huge problem since the knife was only 8 dollars; however, I do have to re-tighten the screws (phillips and torx) every week or so to keep the knife from essentially falling apart. I rated this knife 5 stars when I first received it but I have since changed it to 4 stars for the screw issues. Still a great knife for the money but it just can't take the punishment of an everyday carry.

The thumb knob for opening is super slick and the blade locks tight when open. It is easy to close with minimal effort.

  I love this TAC Force knife! The flipper is very smooth and is the best I have ever seen, even compared to my friend's more expensive Kershaw. The blade came very sharp and the serrations work like magic on rope. The size is perfect for me and most of my other friends love it too. The bottle opener works perfectly and the glass breaker doubles as a flat head screwdriver. The steel is very corrosion resistant and has not rusted yet. Overall this knife is better than more expensive knives and I think as a knife enthusiast it's worth around $30.

  I purchased the ""rainbow"" one because it looked really cool and it lived up to the expectations I was hoping for.it came sharp, well packaged, and is very sturdy. If it was a dollar or two cheaper that would be more worth it for some people, but for me I'm satisfied and it's a great pocket knife for me.

  Bulkier than expected. Knife isn’t spring assisted, which is fine, but opening it requires a level of force I wasn’t anticipating.Build quality seems good. Knife was sharp out of the box. Time will tell if the knife has durability or not.

  This knife looks awesome!  It is a really good deal and the quality is quite nice.  All metal and has built in tools such as: a seat-belt cutter (which is what the teeth are for) and a glass breaker which is what you would use the end for and a belt clip.  It is a little smaller than I thought but that is good for keeping it concealed. The spring action is nice and the blade comes out the box pretty sharp.

",3.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2016","









  
  
    
  This knife arrived quickly, which was a nice surprise. Once it was opened, I flipped it right out. But there was an issue. The inner lock and spring assist had issues, the knife would not fling out as it should, and once it was out it wouldn't lock. I was ready to send it back, though after fiddling with it, it finally worked, and flipped out and locked as it's supposed too. I've ordered one of there before, they are great knives for the price. I am a constant Tac-Force buyer, I am usually very satisfied with their products. This knife has a heavier metal frame which is nice, compared to other hard plastic frames on other Tac-Force models. Also, this knife it extremely sharp! Cut myself within the first few minutes. The rainbow finish was a nice touch too.

  This is my first knife. It's got a decent weight for its size. Assisted opening opens easily with a satisfying click. Haven't had to use bottle opener or glass breaker, but other reviews say you need to open the knife to use the bottle opener (if you haven't read that). Pretty cool design. Comes very sharp. Clip seems very rigid on mine, might be because I just keep in my pocket or backpack. Somewhat difficult to close, but that might be because it's new.For my first knife and its price I give it five stars. Plus I really like how the colorful blade stands out from the black handle.

  I buy these in bulk orders of 2-3 since I lose them. Good cheap solid dependable knife. I use this constantly at my job. It is sharp and at hand when I need it and folds up to disappears when it is done being used. The blade itself has a really nice shimmery purple look to it, mixed with the ""shark fin"" look make the whole piece look very sharp. Big fan of this line!

  For the money this knife performs as you would expect it too.  Granted I only use it as a glorified box cutter but what drew me to the knife was its additional combo of window breaker and bottle opener.  Thankfully I have not had the opportunity to test the window breaker but the bottle opener end is a little bit clunky to use, not as smooth to use as a more traditional opener but will open it nonetheless.  The blade was sharp when received and the overall color and design was fantastic.

  This seems to be a good quality knife so far. It came sharp and after using it for about a month on miscellaneous stuff,  it is still holding an edge. The only complaint I have so far is the bottle opener part of the knife is a piss poor design, I really don't like the idea of having to have the knife open to use the bottle opener, that is an accident waiting to happen. On the Pro side, I like that the window breaker is flat instead of a point, I've used it a couple times as a screw driver.

  The blade was not very sharp but would still cut, just used the flat head on the end today to get old painted over screws out of a door hinge. The tip of the knife has not broken off or even chipped. Also the “switchblade” part to get the knife to open works well just needs a bit of muscle the first few times.

  Arrived literally 48 hours after I ordered it and an entire week before it's estimated delivery date! It is absolutely gorgeous and is extremely sharp. I purchased it because I was tired of spending $50+ on what I thought were good knives that I could use for work only to have the blade become dull and even snap after a month. I can not believe the quality for the price. Quite possibly the best knife I've ever owned.

  I was NOT expecting a knife of this quality for such a low price! It's extremely durable, HEAVY, and absolutely beautiful. One press of the switch and it opens quickly, locks in place, and stays strong so long as it's drawn--tere's not a single loose screw that might compromise its efficiency. Beautiful knife! Sharp too!

  When I first got the knife, it did not open fully (locked open) when ""flicked out"". Only after about 50 times of opening it, did it then become locked open when opened.The knife was also not as sharp as I would have liked it, and I therefore had to sharpen the knife.But other than those two things, it is a great knife.

    Can't flick it open safely
  
",4.0,Jonathan Young,"Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2015","









  
  
    
  It's a sturdy knife, looks awesome. The only problem I have with it is that it takes way too much pressure to flick it open with the small protrusion near the bottom of the blade. It feels very unsafe. It's probably just better to open the knife conventionally, that is pinch the top of the blade and rotate it out. I imagine this will diminish with time however.

  Its such a beautiful knife and I HAD to add it to my collection. At first glance, it looks like something the Arbitor would use. Alien looking is what I'm getting at and it is quite unique in that aspect. Its rather weighty for its size and when it arrived, the metal cutouts were still visible on the blade so I had to groom it before I felt like I could show it to people which was a bit of a drawback, but in the end I got what I wanted.

His brother liked his knife so I bought him one for a Christmas stocking stuffer.  The sisters liked them so now they have them to keep creepy bad dudes away.  My oldest son, the Marine says this, ""I use this knife every day.  It's my work knife, my hunting, camping, farming, fishing, and self-defense knife...my everything knife.  It's got a great clip on it, it looks great, it's still sharp after two years and it was cheap.""Our family gives it 5 stars!!

  I have some expensive knives that I hardly use because they cost 10x as much as this one and I don't want to wear them out with everyday use.  This knife I can bring with me everywhere and not care if it gets beat up because I can easily afford a new one!  Awesome!

  Really good knife for the price. It's actually pretty sharp. I like that it has a surrated part on the blade. It feels good in your hand. I've used another knife with this type of handle that cut into your hand when you try to cut with it. This one doesn't do that at all. You do need to make sure the blade is fully opened and secured before you start using it so that it doesn't fold up on you while you're trying to use it. You could cut you're self otherwise. I wouldn't let a kid use it, or anyone that doesn't realize you need to check that the lock is in place first.

  I was so excited to purchase this knife because of how deadly, yet girly it looks.  All the features of the knife were great as well, until I actually tried to use it.  I bought this knife as a tool and a form of protection when I traveled to Africa by myself last month and was more than a little frustrated when it did not work.  I almost cut my finger off and ended up having to superglue a large cut I gave myself from this knife.  The locking mechanism to hold the knife open failed to work the third time I used it, and I can no longer use the knife for fear of it closing on my hand.

  Bought a second TAC Force after having one for 3 years. Compared to my old pink TAC Force, opening the knife via the spring assist was extremely much harder and stiffer compared to my old one. This was very disappointing. The spring would get stiff midway and not open, whereas on the pink one it would open immediately with much less pressure needed and it was much smoother. I'm not sure if the quality has decreased over time or if I was just unlucky. I will just have to open the knife via the blade from now on.

  It looks fantastic and fits my style. Only complaint is that the pocket clip is really hard to open and that there's a fair bit of resistance with the blade when it's opening--I cannot open it one handed.
