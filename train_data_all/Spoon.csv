  I will NEVER agree on reviews, now that I bought this spoons and found that the reviews were just to jeopardize them.. They are just but a perfect fit for eating using them.. They are NOT big or small as indicated in some reviews, they are just a PERFECT fit. They are very sturdy, durable and pocket friendly.. Am super happy with my purchase.. THANK YOU Hiware for putting a smile on my face.. Will be buying more and more from you.

  My room mate eats food in his room and would use my spoons. Apparently he has been throwing them away in the big trash bag in his room, because he was too lazy to wash dishes.

I noticed a spoon in his trash. So long story short I high recommend this great spoons. They are shiny and smooth to eat with. Great mouth feel.

  Bought these as the last set I bought (different brand) is slowly disappearing thanks to roommates taking them to work for lunch and not bringing it back home when done. The other set was ok,  these actually are better looking and have a much nicer feel to them than I was expecting.  It was a pleasant surprise considering the cost wasn't very high. Once these have all disappeared, I'll be looking to buy this brand again.I did buy these when they were on sale on prime day,  but after seeing them, I would buy again even at normal price.

  These are good stainless steel spoons that were bought for school and work lunches. I also bought the Hiware teaspoons in the same pattern. My plan was for us to use them with thermos, including my daughter’s 25-oz zorijushi food jar. The dinner spoon can reach the bottom of the 25 oz jar, but not comfortably. Another problem is that the difference between the teaspoon and dinner spoon is very small, in length and the size of the bowl, which makes it difficult to sort and stack in my flatware drawer.

  I was looking for replacement serving spoons, after 30yrs of displaced/misplaced pieces, when I found the Hiware brand/style on Amazon.  I really liked their simple yet graceful lines, but wondered how they would feel.  I ordered a set of spoons, and I was not disappointed.  The weight was perfect, the edges were smooth to the touch (important to a tactile-sensitive person like me), and they were very smart-looking with all of my dishware!  Next up...dinner forks!

  These spoons are a great value -- strong metal, no sharp edges, beautifully polished, a plain design but with a nice shape and curve to the handle. We have a retreat center and spoons seem to walk away. This is called a ""dinner spoon"" and it is not as big as a serving spoon nor as small as a teaspoon. It is just the size I wanted, as many people, especially men, seem to like a larger spoon for things like soup. I also use them for stirring small pots of food on the stove.

  My family loses spoons a lot. Where do they all go? Do they slip into an alternate Spoon Dimension? Are there aliens that have a special affinity for beaming up spoons? Are we infested with Spoon Trolls?? Until I solve the mystery, Hiware is there for me, selling me sturdy, attractive, perfectly-weighted spoons for an affordable price. They look nice but are generic enough to not clash with the remnants of the set I have. They are heavy enough to feel nice in your hand, but not so heavy that they flip backwards out of my yogurt cup. Don’t you hate it when they flip backwards out of your yogurt cup? I have ordered this 24-set of spoons three times over the past couple years. I am not joking. Someday we will find all the spoons in a glorious, magical rainbow Cascade of Spoons.

  I spent a bit of time searching for just a pack of spoons that were decent quality. I want my spoons to be sturdy enough to scoop a frozen sorbet without surrendering. These spoons are very nice. They look nice. They are the size of spoon you are expecting, not one of the nonsense large sizes that don't fit correctly in silverware organizers. They work nicely for scooping small amounts of things. So far none of the ice cream tests have result in bending. If you just want some spoons, these are some nice spoons. I have not found spoons of similar quality for the price in town or elsewhere online, but I'm also not obsessed with spoons. Like if you're ready to stop looking for spoons, get these spoons. They're fine.
