  I have been searching for the perfect duvet for awhile now - I found it here!  I LOVE that there is a zipper, my husband always manages to get his feet stuck between the buttons (??).  The zipper is a good quality; opens and closes smoothly. Overall, the fabric is pleasingly soft.  There is no extra weight to this, and it is breathable.

  This duvet cover did come wrinkled but I threw it in the wash and dryer and took it out of the dryer immediately so it didin't have a chance to wrinkle and it was perfectly smooth on the bed, same with the pillow cases. It was so soft immediately taking it out of the box and was still so incredibly soft after washing it! Fits my queen perfectly and I love the zipper on the bottom. Just easier ... the ONLY thing I was a little caught off guard by was that I ordered white and next to my bright white sheets, it definitely looks more eggshell or ivory. I didn't need it to be a bright white because my color scheme is neutrals but if you're looking for bright white, it's not. It's SO soft, though. Whoa. I got rid of my top sheet so I could sleep right next to it. Incredibly soft.

  First, I'd like to say I was offered a $20 Amazon gift card, if I like the cover, to write a 5 star review and take a picture.  But I'm giving that up for a 4 star review, mostly because the white is not white.  I had to hide the white pillow cases from my sheets so it wouldn't make the cover look old and worn out.  It is wrinkle free though, but it has no style at all.  Very plain.

",5.0,amadden,"Reviewed in the United States September 19, 2019","









  
  
    
  I ordered this duvet cover mainly because the price was super reasonable for a broke college student. I was honestly baffled with how amazing the quality was when I opened the package. It’s the softest duvet cover I’ve ever had (and I was raised in a house with a mom who has unreasonably high standard for bedding comfort). I got the white, and it’s pristine. I also love that it has a zipper because every other duvet cover I’ve had in the past has had buttons, and they’ve always fallen off. 10/10 recommend!

  First off they sent me the wrong grey, I ordered the dark grey and they sent the light. Which I don’t mind so much, but my bigger complaint is that the comforter doesn’t stay to the ends of the duvet cover, leaving you and your partner slowly moving towards the middle of the bed all night to avoid the parts of the blanket that are just two thin pieces of cloth, till you wake up smushed together (and not in the good way).

  This is my first duvet and I'm thrilled with it. The pink mocha is a perfect neutral, blush color.  (I was specifically concerned about buying a blush cover that might appear too pink or fussy.) The microfiber material is soft and inviting. I washed and dried it using cool temps and it came out beautifully.  I love it so much that I'm considering buying another one in a different color just so I have two on hand. 100% recommend.

  My comforter stays inside of it well without bunching up or falling into awkward spots.

  Absolutely Beautiful! After years of searching, I finally found the perfect duvet! The quality of the fabric and how well it's made add the clean, elegant look I was looking for!Finding the right shade of a very soft pink was also key as it  gently brings out the distinctive design and colors of my great grandmother's silk wall tapestry...it's about as neutral as pink can be for a romantic couple's room.I also added thin, soft velvet sheets that couldn't have matched more perfectly. I'm SO thankful! Highly Recommend!

  I am in love with this duvet!! I bought a king size to fit over my queen size comforter and it fits perfect. It is the softest duvet I’ve ever felt making it so comfortable it feels like i’m wrapped up in a cloud. I washed and dried it on low heat and it came out completely wrinkle free. I purchase the white duvet. I wish it came in other colors like taupe or tan but I love it so much I will purchase another color. It feels like an expensive luxury duvet but very affordable.

    WTF IS A DUVET? A French word for sheets?!?!
  
",5.0,Billie29,"Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  I didn’t know what a duvet cover was and I had searched sheet sets, so I just thought it was a French word that meant Sheets. So I was expecting sheets for my bed. When it came I didn’t take it out of the zippered pouch it came in, I just opened it and felt them and they were extremely soft! I wanted to put them on right then but I had just changed my sheets the day before so I put them on the shelf in the laundry room. I had also ordered a new comforter that hadn’t came in. A month later I had everything I had ordered to make up my bed! Imagine my surprise when I pulled what I thought was sheets out and started seeing a zipper like something would have to go in and NO fitted sheet was with it. Just 2 nice extra soft pillow cases! I was so bumfuzzled! I called my daughter and asked her what is duvet cover? She laughed and said you zip up one that you don’t use In it or that you got and didn’t like and “Vio’la” your “Duvet” is now all new!I wish I hadn’t waited to open it up and take it out of the package because truthfully I would have returned it. It wasn’t the item I needed but like I said VERY SOFT AND WARM TO SLEEP WITH! Good Buy*

  I’ve had this for about a month. I washed it when I first bought it and put in on my comforter. At first I really liked it. It was super soft and comfortable. Then I washed it a second time and the softness was gone, the material started pilling and snagging. I also don’t like how the ties are only in the corners, so the comforter slips all over inside this thing.I know this wasn’t the most expensive duvet cover I could have bought, but it wasn’t exactly cheap either.

  Updated review 7/10/2020:I initially LOVED this duvet cover because it was the softest to snuggle with. It was great, but I started noticing myself waking up in pools of sweat in the morning. I have always been a hot sleeper but the damp sheets in the morning were excessive - never experienced it in my life. I am a 26 year-old, average weight petite woman and I have not had any changes in my diet or exercise routine, so I found the damp sheets odd. After almost a year with this duvet cover, I decided to change up my style in bedroom and ordered a duvet cover (different brand) that was 100% natural cotton. The fabric on the new duvet is not as soft as this one, but after several nights, I noticed that the pools of sweat were gone and I slept cooler in the night. Unfortunately, that means that the culprit in the situation was this duvet cover which was causing me to overheat in my sleep. It retains A LOT of body heat and moisture. If you are a hot sleeper, you may want to buy other sheets.Original review 08/09/2019:I know that it sounds dramatic, but I have been waiting my entire adult life for this duvet! I am 25 years old to put that in context for you, but I travel frequently for work and have always been a little disappointed to come home to my bed and not the luxury sheets that I have grown used to during my stay in hotels. This duvet, however, completely changes that for me! It is the softest, most comfortable thing to snuggle up in bed with after a long day. It has simply made me look forward to coming home and getting a good night's rest.

    Dreaming ""WHOOPWHOOP"" Wapiti...

  Ohhh Boy...Ok, so, this was my first duvet purchase, ever. I have alternative down comforters, that are white, with a toddler....so in my attempt to save them from anymore ruin, I stumbled across the Dreaming Wapiti. I read the reviews, like I always do prior to purchasing anything online. It definitely had great reviews. I dont usually write reviews, but since they have helped me so much lately, I figured mine might help someone else. Especially with social distancing and a lot of shopping is mainly online now...Back to the duvet cover....talk about soft and comfy!!! I ordered the Mocha Pink, it goes perfectly with my dark grey headboard and deep purple decor in my room. I will admit I had a hard time getting my cover inside (remember this is my first experience with a duvet cover) I laid it out on my floor, inside out, laid my comforter on top, corner to corner, pulled corners of my comforter (almost like making a pony tail) then used to corner ties from duvet to tie around corners, keeping comforter in place. Then I carefully tucked comforter into the duvet cover, right side in, through the small area that zips open. Zipped it up and VIOLA!! My toddler, kitty cat and I all slept very snug and have been ever since...I did wash prior to using, make sure you keep the duvet zipped up or else it could break, per the instructions.Although I have no other duvet cover to compare this one to, I can tell you that I am a ""snob"" when it comes to what I sleep on; pillows, sheets, blankets...I wanna feel like I'm sleeping on a cloud and my duvet cover is exactly what I wanted. I've had it for a week now and no problems thus far, except I look forward to bedtime even soon than before. Hope this helps!!

  I purchased the gray king size duvet cover. I like how it washes without ruining the quality or softness. It comes with the inside ties to keep the duvet in place. The zipper ensures that the duvet stays clean and fully inside the cover. The only thing that I didn’t love is how difficult it was to fully put the duvet in but I think that’s just because the king size is so large. I still was able to do it on my own though.

  As a guy that has been sleeping alone on a twin mattress for his whole life, the concept of bedding existing beyond my limited world of a single pillow and blanket completely baffled me. When I had to fill out my registry for my upcoming wedding, it was completely mind-boggling to find out that there are things on this planet such as quilts, duvets, comforters, throws, flat sheets, bed skirts, and an extensive collection of different species of pillows! (I still don't understand what purpose a ""sham"" serves.) Despite my own discomfort in learning about these things, let alone shopping for them, buying and using this duvet cover was incredibly simple. We got the king-size gray cover, and although my fiancee guided me through the installation process, it was really simple and easy (flip it inside out, tie the duvet corners, turn right-side out). The fabric is soft and comfortable, and it will obviously be used all the time, so we'll definitely get our money's worth out of it. Despite the tight packaging, the cover was relatively wrinkle-free which really surprised me! Overall, great product, happy (and less confused) customer.

Unfortunately, my duvet cover also ripped the second time I washed it. Also, it did not do my hair any favors. I have fine hair and I woke up every morning with I can only describe as greasy hair.

  I have only had this duvet cover for about a week but so far it is perfect and i will update my review if there are any negative things people should know.Most new things aren't the same after that first wash but this duvet is still so soft and comfortable. I'd say its a little on the warm side but that is also because of the down comforter inside of it.It is not some beautiful duvet, very plain and looks like an oversized pillow cover but thats ok with me.I bought a king and fits my king comforter perfectly, the ties inside make it super easy to attach and the zipper is perfectly placed so it is not noticeable.

  I've only been using this duvet set for a few days but I love it so far! I was a bit surprised by the quality when I opened the package. I wasn't expecting it to look and feel so nice. The zipper works and is hidden as promised in the description. It really is a nice update for it bedroom. I like the casual and comfy look and it is softer than I expected. The fabric is sturdy (not thin like some cheaper versions). I would definitely purchase again!

  I ordered this when I finally decided to go back to using a comforter for winter after trying to keep warm under summer coverlet with tons of blankets. I veered away from comforters as I like a neater look. However, this cover, not being 100% cotton, looks nice and smooth once I steamed out a few wrinkles and is very soft to the touch. I haven't washed yet as we still use sheets, so don't know how much it will wrinkle after. The pillow shams are very basic, but I have decorative pillows anyway.

  I was very hesitate to purchase site unseen, but was very surprised at the quality of product I received. So pleasantly surprised, I'm purchasing another for back up.The material is a soft, almost linen feel to it. Perfect fit, and with the inside ties my duvet did not slide or move at all, and to me that is a huge selling factor. I would suggest this to anyone needing a good soft duvet cover. It definitely fits in with the new linen phase that seems to be in fashion right now. I got the pink, which is a really pretty blush color. Thank goodness!!  Just give it a try, I promise you will not be disappointed.

The duvet I have inside is the Linenspa All-Season White Down Alternative Quilted Comforter (also amazing).

  The cover was very soft and seemed like it would be comfortable. But I will be returning it because the color is not at all what was shown in the pictures and is not what I wanted. I ordered the grey and was sent what looks like the ""light grey"" from their photos. It seems as though whoever packaged it just grabbed the closest ""grey"" one they could find and threw it in the bag. The best word to describe the one I received is DRAB. It almost looks dirty. I will just order from a different company to avoid the inevitable ""colors vary by batch, and photos were taken by a professional photographer"" spiel that I'll get if I complain about the color. Photos taken by a professional photographer should mean that the color is almost exactly what you actually receive, not drastically different.

  Since our pup likes to jump up on the bed, I was looking for something easy to clean. The fabric is very nice quality and feels nice to sleep under. The weight is also a plus, we just put our old comforter inside of the duvet cover and those two combined makes it have a light weighted blanket feel to it. Though the color wasn't what I necessarily was going for (the gray is more cool colored than the warm color I was looking for) I could not be more happy with it. The comforter inside also stays in place instead of falling down inside the duvet cover like our previous one did.

The duvet is very soft, like a soft sheet. It looks and feels great and it fit very well with the comforter. My dog really liked it as well. I slept great!

  I was so excited to find a duvet in this color (blush pink is waaay harder than I thought to find) but when I got it I noticed the color was completely different than whats pictured; it's more of a cute lighter pink rather than a tone of pink. Wasn't super soft either, I returned the product.

  i love this duvet cover. very soft and comfortable. one big con is that i washed it before i put it on my bed and there’s already loose threads. so i guess it won’t last that long but it’s very pretty and the exact color i was looking for.i wash my bedding once a week so i know the threads will keep coming undone and it will begin to fall apart sadly :( otherwise love it.

This one was SUPER white (like made my other pillowcases look yellow) and VERY soft. It’s a smooth Jersey material. Fits perfect, easy to put on feels and looks great.

  If your hesitant to buy, don't be! Just note: THIS IS A DUVET COVER, NOT A COMFORTER. Bought this for my daughter's bed. My daughter LOVES IT!!! The pink color is a really settle pink, just what she wanted. There were no harsh smells out of the box, which is nice. The duvet didn't come with any ties inside, but that was no problem. The comforter doesn't shift around a lot in the duvet, anyway. It's perfect!

  This product is a great product. The only reason it didn’t work for us is because of our kitten. She would stick her little nails in it and it made it feel like you were laying in a bed of cookie crumbs but that’s not the covers fault. We will just have to get something thicker for now. It was very comfortable. It was my husbands first time trying out a duvet and he slept very comfortable for the time we had it. It is VERY thin and I know some people like that but I like that thicker feel to blankets. It’s priced perfectly. It’s a very good product unless you have a little kitten

This is meant to have a comforter put inside it, if you don't know, it isn't just a fancy word for comforter. The zipper functions fine, it has ties in the corners, and the pillow shams are also so soft and have the little flaps to keep your pillows inside.

  I have put off buying a duvet cover for months because I could never find one I liked. This one is a dream. It’s so cozy and soft and I’ve gotten a lot of compliments on it. It was easy to get on and has stayed in place since I put it on. The color is exactly as shown in the photos. I have not washed it yet but so far it has held up great.

  I was looking for a duvet cover for my down comforter and I chose this one because it was relatively cheap, had good reviews, and looked like high quality material. I love this duvet cover! It fits my comforter really well, its soft and super warm. The only thing I somewhat dislike is how it gets wrinkly, but once you make the bed it smoothes right out! I am very satisfied with this company. If you're looking for a sign to choose a duvet cover, this is it!

  This cover is absolutely beautiful. The material is very soft; heavier than bed sheets but not too hot. I loved the simplicity of the zip. Most covers I had before had buttons or poppers. I also love the corner ties. Duvets that move in their covers are never comfortable. I chose the pink which turned out not to be quite right for my room so I am returning it and getting the white.

  I love this duvet! It is incredibly soft and has a very “clean” look to it. It is also very easy to clean. No fuss, just cuteness (I got the pink one). I was a little worried the pink would be too much, but it really isn’t. It is clearly pink, but not overbearing, and pink is NOT typically my color, it’s just the color that fit best with the pallet of my room. My only complaint is that it’s starting to snag a little from my cats, but also that is completely understandable since I purchased it to stop my cats from tearing huge slashes in my comforter.

  I bought this cover with a quilt-pattern duvet. It was easy to put together with the little roll-up duvet cover hack.Pros: super soft and thin. Laying under this truly felt like a cloud. Came with matching pillow cases, which are also soft. Has a zipper and ribbon ties for each corner.Cons: Will show the pattern of the duvet underneath, I was able to see the squares if I laid on it or my cat laid on it (I didn't mind this but this might bother some people.) If you have pets with nails, I have a cat with claws, and they get stuck, the fabric will pull. I ended up having some lines on it and some strings coming out, even on my pillow case. This was a little hard to avoid cause my cat lives in my room (if your pet doesn't, or has short or no nails, this is easily avoidable.) Collects cat hair pretty easily. A few of the ribbon ties came undone, but when tied too tight were a struggle to untie.I had to stop using this because I live in a hot state so I needed a lighter blanket for summer and my queen bed is now against the wall so too much of the duvet + cover ended up on the floor.

I was able to do some googling and figure out how to repair the zipper and close it, so I did not bother to contact the seller and complain.

  This was purchased as a cover for a comforter in a rental location. It is very soft and nice neutral color (grey).  The only ""issue"" is the zipper closure which at first I was thrilled with because it's faster than buttons, but it's easy for it to get stuck or caught on the fabric so you just need to take extra care when zipping.  Be aware also, when using any duvet cover, they tend to get balled up in the dryer so you need to dry them in small increments to undo them or dry alone so it doesn't start collecting treasures like other sheets and towels.  Overall pleased with purchase!

  I was pleasantly surprised with how soft this duvet is considering how affordable it was. I ordered the pink, and the color is a little more pigmented than I expected, but still lovely if you're looking for something simple and clean. The item was naturally wrinkled due to packaging, but I tossed it in the dryer on high heat and go most of the wrinkles out. There are still some shallow wrinkles in the fabric, but they are barely noticeable and I expect them to slowly fall the longer the duvet lays on the bed. The duvet also comes with corner ties to keep the comforter in place. All in all, I give it 5 stars based on quality, price, and softness.

  I purchased this duvet cover to protect my quilt from getting dirty. I particularly like that it has a zipper closure, which I prefer more than buttons. The button version ones get loose after a while and doesn't keep the whole cover sealed properly. I also find that buttons are uncomfortable with my feet while sleeping. So I was happy that this version had a zipper instead. The pink mocha colors is like a salmon color, more like a pink peach. Would have liked more of a pink color which is more interchangeable with other covers and cases in my linen set.Overall, good quality at a reasonable price.

  This is a very nice quality duvet cover. Our “duvet” that is in it isn’t that thick fits in it really well.

  I used to like high-count linens for my bed, but I recently switch to the new microfiber fabrics. They're soft, and one thing that surprised me is that they're not as cold as cotton when you get into bed on a cold night.This cover is very comfortable. I recently got a fiber fill duvet that keeps me nice and warm in winter, but I was afraid it would be too hot in summer. The Dreaming Wapiti cover will be perfect.

  It's a good basic duvet for the price. I waited to write a review until I washed and dried it once. There was probably about 12-15% shrinkage after that washing, but it still fills my needs which was to be large enough to cover a very high queen-sized mattress and durable enough for a surprisingly dirty little dog to shed on all day and night long.I enjoy the feel of it a great deal - very lush. As pictured below, my dog enjoys it as well.Non-wrinkly even after a few tumbles in the dryer (didn't need much heat or very long dryer time either- dried very fast).My only complaint which isn't a complaint more of a whine is that when I first got it, I accidentally hit one of the bottom corners with a vacuum cleaner which immediately burned a hole.  So beware of those corners.

  Pros: Very soft to the touch.

I noticed a difference the first night I used it, and it was hot enough to remove from my duvet and return immediately the next morning.

  I stand by my original review (below). I had gone on to have a bit of a mix-up with the seller which I included in an updated review (now deleted). The seller responded immediately to their error and went above and beyond the call of good customer service to make it right, and continues to assure my customer satisfaction. At this point, I can’t say enough good things about this duvet and transaction. If you’re looking for a great product and trustworthy vendor, you found it here. I have the white duvet and it arrived in great condition, it’s super soft, clean and bright. I am adding this update rather than deleting the thread so the seller’s comment below makes sense. There was a mix-up that unknown to them reflected poorly, but they went far beyond anything I would have expected to make sure I was happy.ORIGINAL REVIEW:This duvet is beautiful. My down comforter fits perfectly inside the king size. The microfiber texture is soft, smooth and silky. It's exactly what I was looking for to keep my insert clean. It was easy to work with and it stays straight on my bed. Would highly recommend, great value for the price.

  Was very disappointed with size of comforter. I have a king size bed, not California king and the comforter would be better on a queen sized bed. It barely hangs over any of the edges. Over all, other than size I'm ok with it. Wish it was a little more light weight but it is very warm. I put in duvet cover.

  Recently we purchased a new mattress and it came with a white microfiber duvet set.  First of all, let's face it -- white is not for every day use at least in my household.  However, I never thought I'd prefer microfiber over Egyptian cotton, but I do now.  Attempting to match my gray curtains, I found this set.  I was hesitant at  first fearing my husband would dislike it.  Turns out, it is such a light microfiber, he doesn't know it's not cotton.  It feels light and airy, even when it's warmer out.  I like the quality and it doesn't wrinkle as much as the cotton when I forget to remove it from the dryer.

  I wanted a duvet that has ties.  I’m tired of the comforter moving around.  This duvet has ties in each corner and on each side which is nice.  When the package arrived, it was packaged well.  Straight from the package you can feel it’s softness.  After washing, it was even softer.  It lays well on the bed and depending on the comforter you put it in, it can light for summer or heavy for winter.  The zipper is nicely hidden but be careful in zipping it.  It can catch.  I would give this a five star but as you can see in the photo, I noticed thread pulling.  I don’t even know how that happened.  I do love the color and the feel of this comforter.

My hopes were that it was just a one off and thought I would give it another go because I loved the color (pink mocha) . Well, second duvet came and did the same same but the pilling started at week three and it looks awful and now it’s too late to return!  I don’t understand how this product has such good reviews because my two that I received can’t be the only ones that this happened to ! Yes, when you first  get the duvet and pillow cases they will be so soft you will love them and that’s probably when most of the people wrote the reviews before the pilling started!

  I really love this comforter! It is very soft, and feels quite more expensive than it actually is. It doesn’t have that creepy microfiber texture. However… and this is a big however for me – – it definitely holds dog hair. I believe the description says that it won’t attract dog hair, but that is definitely not true. I have a 25 pound hypoallergenic, essentially non-shedding dog and I have to lint roll the cover once a week. Personally, the comfort outweighs the inconvenience, but if you have a dog/cat that sheds a lot, you will probably notice it right away.

  I received this queen duvet and two pillow cases with unbelievable speed. It came the next day, neatly packaged, clean and brand new. I ran it through the washer and dryer for 30 mins and started to put the comforter and duvet together. I love the corner slips to secure the comforter and I love the zipper. The zipper on this duvet hide the insert without it touching my skin. I hate the button feel against my body from other duvets. I find this Wapiti duvet amazingly soft and silky against my bare skin and the first night was like sleeping on clouds. I’m not sure about the thread count or fiber quality on this duvet but I have linens of 1000 thread count and this Wapiti duvet feels soften. Overall I give this a 5 star for the softness, product quality and price. This is way better than the duvets at Target, Walmart or IKEA.

  My partner and I have been struggling to find a cover that we both like for aesthetics and comfort, but luckily came across this one! We love it so far and it’s the perfect combo of lightweight (for warm summers) and durability.

  The fabric is buttery soft.  Love the muted pink!  I also love that although it's a microfiber fabric it doesn't show handprints like other types of microfiber.  It's super light weight too!  I do wish it fit better though.  My cal king comforter is swimming inside it.  Seems like the dimensions are a little off no matter which way I orient it.  I really like the idea of the ties in the corners although I think the ribbon should be more generous so that you can tie a slip not/bow because the ribbons are so short all you can do is tie a square not which makes it hard to get out when you need to launder the duvet.

  It's  a good duvet. I like the zipper and ties to keep my comforter in place. The color is exactly like the pic. I recomment.

  I chose this duvet cover for my king size bed because it was a simple color and had great ratings. All were true. The material isn't too heavy so it keeps the comforter at night light and the material is nice and soft. Since it's the middle of summer right now, it's light enough to still keep me cool. I originally bought the grey and now considering buying the pink one!
