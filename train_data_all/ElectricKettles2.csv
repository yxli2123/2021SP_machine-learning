    Awesome Kettle
  
",5.0,ceaser trevino,"Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2019","









  
  
    
  I use to use a microwave or a medium pot to boil water for a cup of noodles or to have a glass of tea, but what a difference this kettle makes. I plugged it in , followed the instructions and within minutes I had hot water. The large kettle size provides approximately 8 cups of water. The glass build allows you to see though the kettle and watch the water bubbles come to a boil. The location of the predefined buttons is a great feature and the 6 predefined settings to be set very quickly. Safety feature to auto shutoff and the led blinking light remind me that the kettle is still on while in warm mode. I have never used a kettle before but i was impressed with this one. No more pots or microwave in my immediate future.

  ¬†I love the fact that I can see the water coming to a boil. The blue LED light tells me that it's heating, so when that light goes off, it's done. EASY! Then it's really cool that it goes to keep warm straight away. Or, you can bypass that option if you want. It also has memory features! This water pot is the coolest thing EVER! LOVE IT!

",5.0,Once-ler,"Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  This is my first water boiler; I used a microwave before this.  Seems sturdy and well made.  Boiled water for my tea in about 2 minutes (1 liter) which was less than half the time for the microwave.  Will hold up to 2 liters.  Buttons make it easy to choose the right temperature quickly.  Has a built in filter which is nice.  The top does not come off, but I was able to squeeze my hand inside to wash it before the first use.Overall quality and price point are great.

    Who knew exact water temps make beverages better?!!
  
",5.0,Tim Nuse,"Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  This electric kettle comes in a non-descript box but it looks good and works great once unpackaged. Brings water to a boil in just a few minutes and has all the settings for various tea strains and coffee brewing methods. I‚Äôve tried it for a few beverages and they really do taste better with water heated to the appropriate temperature. I used to always use boiled water for everything and now realize I was living in a cave. For anyone who consumes hot beverages, this is the way to go!

  Very happy with this electric kettle - the HadinEEon Variable Temperature. Why? It is much quieter than my last electric kettle, it comes to the boil quickly, the lid is easy to open for filling, and it is a delight to use.However, the water level marking on the kettle is not accurate which is disappointing for a precision temperature kettle. The photo shows the water level of 0.5L water which I measured using a measuring jug -- so it's a little above the line.

  ¬†Being from the South, I'm always looking for a cool glass of sweet tea in the summer, yet when I made it at home it was always lacking something. I had no idea I was making it wrong until I found this kettle. Something about it just makes tea taste so much better, and it's ready in no time. The blue lights are awesome too. Drinks and a light show for only $40? Yes please. My cleaner likes it too, she said it's easy to clean and is just the right size for the cabinets for easy storage. The problem is that we haven't put it away since I bought it, so I think it's just going to be a permanent part of my kitchen counter, which is fine because the beautiful black and stainless steel look really matches everything else anyways.  It feels very solid so I don't think I'll ever have to worry about it breaking if one of my dogs knocks it if the counter, but if they were somehow able to break it I would definitely buy another.

    Much Better Than a Stove Top Kettle
  
",5.0,leed39,"Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2019","









  
  
    
  This is a really nice unit if you boil water often.  My wife likes to take a thermos full of hot water with her to work so each morning she puts a kettle on the stove and goes about other morning chores.  When the kettle whistles, you drop everything and run to take the kettle off the burner.  The HadinEEon Electric Kettle makes this morning routine much simpler and far less worrisome.  At full capacity it will bring 8 cups of water to a full boil in about 8 minutes.  It‚Äôs also a clear glass kettle so you can see your water come to a boil.  There are multiple temperature selections and a ""Keep Warm"" feature so all you have to do is set and go.  A blue light ring let‚Äôs you know the unit is on.  It shuts off when your water is boiling and intermittently turns back on and off to keep your water at the desired temp until you‚Äôre ready to go.  No more scrambling to shut off a screaming stove top kettle and water is piping hot when you pour!  Love it, this gadget get my thumbs up!

    Nice addition to my collection of teas
  
",5.0,JJ,"Reviewed in the United States August 18, 2019","









  
  
    
  Obviously, temperature control is the most important function, great for non-black teas. It's also a very good-looking kettle, especially because of the glowing. Because it's made of glass, it's much easier to clean (and much easier to see that it actually needs cleaning). One thing that I still need to get used to - it doesn't beep when you press on different temperature buttons. Basically, one it starts glowing, it's heating up the water. Besides that, it's pretty easy to use.

    ALL 5 STAR REVIEW??
  
",4.0,shadylane,"Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2019","









  
  
    
  This seems like a very nice electric kettle.  I like that it has different temperatures for the different types of tea and the pot seems to hold more water than my last kettle did.  That being said, with the pot I received a notice from the manufacturer stating that if I reviewed the kettle and sent them a copy of it, I could choose from one of six items that they would send me for free.  The implication is to give them a good review.  I did not send them a copy of this review; it's my honest opinion and the company doesn't need  stoop to this type of practice.  The pot can stand on its merits.

  This things boils quicker than my stovetop kettle and my husband brewed a batch of coffee in a fraction of the time of a normal drip coffee machine. Absolutely love and its addicting to see the glowing blue light. The booklet suggests cooking temps per beverages like different types of tea and coffee which was very helpful. Cord wraps nicely under base so its not bulky or off balance. Cord length is about 1 1/2 ft.

",1.0,Z. W.,"Reviewed in the United States August 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  I honestly don't understand how this listing has so many positive reviews and no one mentioning a bad smell.I received one Kettle, ran two batches of water, then a 1/3 white vinegar 2/3 water boiled through, left overnight, and rinsed with two batches of water. This heavy, manufactured plastic smell was so strong coming off the water/kettle that I felt unsafe consuming anything coming from it.I returned the kettle and swapped it out for a new one, thinking it was a one-off. Same. Exact. Problem.If you are looking for a kettle that doesn't leech some weird chemical into your water or produces water that smells like something you'd actually like to consume, look elsewhere.

  I absolutely love this kettle! I‚Äôve had one for awhile, but it didn‚Äôt have temperature control so making tea was always a hassle having to get the thermometer out and wait for the water to cool down to the correct temperature. I love that it not only has the temperature control, but also tells you what tea would go at that temperature. It‚Äôs very sleek looking as well with the clear glass, blue LED, and well made handle. Great investment if you like tea, coffee, hot water with lemon, and the list goes on and on!

    Good Looking Kettle
  
",4.0,Natalia,"Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2019","









  
  
    
  We got this kettle a couple of days ago and like the looks of it a lot.  We also like the various temperatures for different teas and coffee and find they do make a difference.  The only complaint, and the reason for four stars instead of five, is the poor design of the lid.  It is awkward to open and close.  If you don't push the little screen down it won't shut, and it is not as easy to open as other kettles as the button is on the lid instead of on the handle.  Otherwise, a good purchase for a reasonable price.

    DANGER *Update* *Second Update*
  
",5.0,MamaMolly,"Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  Just want to add now that I have had the replacement kettle for almost a month... it is working perfectly. Better than the first one actually. It happens we sometimes get a defective model of something but the company went above and beyond to make it right. I highly recommend the HadinEEon Kettle.Last and FINAL Update. i think.Surprisingly the company saw my Review and reached out to me. I never expected that after so much time had elapsed.They apologized for the problems with both the kettle and that I had not received a response. Wary at first at receiving an email out of the blue I called Amazon Customer Service to find out how I could verify it was indeed from the company.  After getting a contact number from Amazon I called and confirmed the email was legitimate.  Once I did that I returned the email from Stephen of Customer Service and have received a replacement for the kettle.I'm thrilled they did honor the Warranty. I loved the Kettle and was so disappointed it had problems. I have made pour over coffee forever now and tea all the time. I am so happy to have the kettle replaced.Having had this very positive interaction I raised the Rating from 1 Star to 5.~It seems this company's ""Warranty"" is pretend. I do not think they will ever reply.~I have been trying to get the Company to honor their Warranty and replace the Kettle. So far. NO luck. I will Update if they honor their Warranty.~I do not Review often. When I do it either exceeds expectations or fails miserably. Nor do I ever Review immediately for an offer of a 5 Star review. Ever. When I do it is because I have used an item for some time and it either meet the criteria.In this case this Kettle has turned out to be a Hazard. I purchased the Kettle in March to replace an old fashioned stove top teapot my teen accidentally boiled to dry. Up until this week I was very pleased. It did what it was promised to do.However. This week it stopped turning off after the temperature was met. I came out from the computer room to find the pot was boiling away at the highest setting and had boiled away half the pot instead of shutting off. Initially I thought I had made a mistake. For a couple of days it was normal. But today it is not only back every time I try to make water for tea at the appropriate temp. I just boils away at high no matter the setting.Ironically. I was initially happy enough I was planning to purchase a back up in the event the glass pot ever broke. I make Pour Over coffee and tea so to be without a pot even for a day is not an option. Especially in these times.To pay slightly over $50.00 when I purchased and only get 8 months of use and to be a fire hazard is completely not acceptable.

    Variable Temperature Kettle
  
",1.0,nat4crim,"Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  Update: I've been using this kettle for about a week and it's starting to falter. It used to beep when the temperature level was reached. Now it turns itself on and off. I can only imagine what it will be like in another week. I'm returning it.Also, you should probably take these glowing reviews with a grain of salt. When you receive your kettle they offer you a 'free' gift if you contact them. Once you do, they ask you to review their product. I normally never review a new product but decided to. I initially gave them a 4 star review based on my thoughts underneath and that wasn't good enough. They contacted me and asked me to change my star rating to 5 and offered me a $10 gift card and reminded me how generous they were being giving me a 'free' gift. So they are essentially buying reviews. I told them to keep their gift, I wasn't changing my review. Now of course I am because the product is starting to glitch.I bought this kettle to replace an older one I had. I chose this because I wanted a kettle that allows me to choose the temperature of the water I am boiling. It's very handy for someone who drinks french press coffee and various teas because they all have their own temperature recommendations. I like that this kettle had more temperature settings vs my older one. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I haven't had it long enough to see how well it  holds up and because of a safety concern I have. You have to unplug the kettle after each use. If you leave the kettle on the base with it turned off, the kettle will periodically turn itself on and off. It wasn't clear in the instructions that you need to unplug it and someone may leave not knowing it can turn itself on.

    Ok kettle for the price, not the best quality
  
",2.0,Briana Hall,"Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  This kettle is ok for the price, it looks nice and heats the water efficiently, but after owning it for about a week I noticed it stopped beeping to let me know when the water had reached the correct temperature. It still beeps for boiling water, but not for any of the other temperature settings. Other than that, it works as intended.Edited to add: The company has continued to reach out to me asking me to remove my ""negative"" review so I'm removing stars for sketchy sales behavior. I still have this kettle and still have issues with it not beeping when it reaches temperature. If/when this one stops working I won't be buying this brand again.

    Great addition to the kitchen for the tea lover, but not perfect
  
",4.0,MorganG,"Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  We purchased this to replace a 5-yr old name brand kettle that we‚Äôve used daily - and it‚Äôs finally dying. I debated about whether to go with a large ‚Äúname brand‚Äù or to take a gamble on a lesser-known brand. I guess the adventurer in me caused me to try the lesser-known brand. Plus, it doesn‚Äôt ever hurt to save a few dollars if you can get something that‚Äôs good and lasts.When I review, I rarely give 5-stars unless a product is exceptional. This product seems great so far, but not exceptional.Here are the great things:* The various water temperatures that are easy to access on the handle* Gets the job done of heating the water quickly, and holding it at temp if you want it to* Cool blue lights that make the water sparkle* Handle is easy to grip* It was well packaged and easy to get set up* Though made of glass, it seems quite sturdy* Claims to be BPA Free* Elegant look for the kitchen* Easy to useMinuses:* The lid is not as easy to open as our old kettle, which allowed opening it with a flick of the thumb on the open button. This one is a two handed job of holding the kettle with one hand while manipulating the lid lever with the other* The ‚Äúkeep warm‚Äù feature is not 100% intuitive, and worse, it deactivates as soon as you take the kettle off the base to pour water. So if you want it to keep on keeping on (warm), then you have to remember to re-activate it once there. Our previous kettle had its functions built into the base, and it remembered to keep it warm if the feature was turned on. That was more convenient.Decent but not great:* For those of us who live at higher altitudes - where water boils at 205F instead of 212F - I have not yet found a kettle that can efficiently deal with that. This one does okay but could be better: If you set the water for a full boil, it will boil for several minutes until it figures out that it‚Äôs not going all the way to 212F. It will then ‚Äúbeep‚Äù and temporarily pause boiling, try to boil it again for a shorter time, then finally switch into the keep warm mode where it alternatively boils the water and pauses. It seems somewhat random how long the periods of boiling are - some are very short, some last longer. This is better than our previous kettle which didn‚Äôt deal with the issue at all - but it is still wasting a lot of energy spending all that time keeping the water at a high boil before figuring it out. As a former computer programmer, it doesn‚Äôt seem like it would be hard to build in control circuitry to deal with this issue more intelligently.So, would I recommend it? For the price, yes. It‚Äôs a nice kettle at a good price - especially for one that has all the different temperatures needed for producing the best brewing results of different kinds of tea. However, if some of the small issues aren‚Äôt addressed, when this one wears out, I‚Äôll probably keep looking for the ‚Äúperfect‚Äù kettle (which I admittedly may never find).

This electric kettle takes about 7 minutes to boil, compared to the 10+minutes that my previous electric kettle took to boil (not the hadinEEon, but a generic brand electric kettle).I fully recommend this version if you like tea, otherwise, the simpler version is just as good (and maybe cheaper).

    Excellent kettle for the price
  
",4.0,M. LoCastro,"Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2019","









  
  
    
  I have had a few days to test this kettle out, and this is my early assessment of it.Aesthetically, it is quite nice, matches the other small appliances I have and footprint on the counter is not terrible. I was replacing a 1.5L T-fal pot because I wanted more precise control over the temperature of my water. I have made several cups of tea and heated water for use on the stove, and the experience is pretty much as expected. Where are a couple minor cons, this is still a kettle I would recommend. They aren't deal breakers for me, but for some people they might be, so here they are:1.) Temperature: This was the primary reason that I got the kettle, and also the only reason this is a 4-star review instead of a 5-star one. The T-fal I had had a dial that would be ~167 F at the bottom and boil at any other point along the selector. As I like a variety of different kinds of tea that are best steeped at several different temperatures, this was inconvenient. This kettle is off by 5-7 degrees (under, not over) at its various settings (I have tested them all, with two different thermometers, one digital, one analog) except for boiling. As I am not interested in spending over $100 on a kettle with a super precise sensor, and this is still a dramatic improvement over what I had, I can absolutely live with it, as long as this one continues to function at its current level of accuracy.2.) No chime: Only a couple reviews mention one, and nowhere in the product description does it say there is one, so I think this is meant to be a feature of its quiet operation. It's a minor inconvenience for me since I don't wait right next to the kettle when it's heating up the water. I am an insomniac though, so I see it being a boon for when I am up in the middle of the night and want some chamomile or valerian tea.3.) I realize that coming from a plastic kettle to a glass kettle, and one with a larger capacity at that, this kettle will be heavier than what I am used to. I still was not prepared for how heavy it is when it's full. Since I often use my electric kettle to give water for pasta a head-start, carrying a glass kettle full of boiling hot water across the kitchen when only the handle is cool to the touch is a little harrowing. I have an outlet closer to the hob though, so I can simply move it when I plan to do that.Overall I am very happy with it, and will update if for some reason I ever need to make use of the warranty.

  The HadinEEon electric Kettle is a GAME CHANGER for me!  I work long hours and tend to forget to hydrate.  I would spend a lot of money buying tea, but never made it for myself because of the hassle of going to the kitchen, filling up the traditional stove top kettle and waiting for it to heat etc.  Now that I have the HadinEEon Kettle, it sits next to me and I fill up on tea all day long.  The fact that the instructions have a chart that tell me what temperature suits which teas best is super cool and I am starting to feel like less a brash american and more a sophisticated Brit who knows a thing or two about tea time (not really - but a girl can dream!).

",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  What I wanted:I have a 64 oz / 2 liter insulated growler which I use to make tea that I to bring to the office (in non-pandemic times).  My previous electric kettle only held 48oz of water, so I had to run it twice in order to make a full container of tea.This kettle solves this problem by heating up enough water to make my tea in one go.Unexpectedly useful features:I didn't expect to use any of the other features, but I've found the temperature selection to be very useful.  It turns out that green tea tastes better and is easier to drink at 175 degrees F, so I now use that feature every time.  My insulated growler holds the temperature well enough that I can still make tea in the morning and have hot-ish tea in the evening, even if I don't wring every possible degree out of the water.  So, while I wasn't looking for this feature, I now really appreciate it.I also use the ""Keep Warm"" feature constantly.  I didn't buy this kettle for the ""Keep Warm"" function, but I'm a fan.Lastly, I love the glass container.  I can see the water level from across the kitchen, I can check for scaling at a glance (scaling used to sneak up on my with the stainless steel electric kettle I had before), and it looks nice.  The glass appears to be the same kind of glass used in coffee makers, and it works even better here than it does in a coffee maker, because the water stays cleaner.Usability notes:I had to read the manual in order to understand how the ""Keep Warm"" feature works.  It's only active after the kettle has finished the water through the main heating cycle.  (I had assumed that it would slowly heat the water on low power if activated separately.)  Since I find engineering-language comfortable, I would have preferred that the button be labeled ""Temperature Hold üîí"", since that more accurately describes this function.  Still, it only took about 2 minutes to read the manual, and I use this function frequently, so it's a win.Another usability issue is that I'm about 60%/40% ambidextrous, and 2 of my three kids are left-handed.  The writing on the glass is only in the ideal position when you are holding the handle in my right hand.  When I hold the pitcher in my left hand (which I do almost half the time), it's harder to see the fill-markings (because I'm frequently filling it up to the 2L / Maximum level).  Putting the labels on both sides would be better.Overall, this thing is really easy to use.  These are nitpicks, not showstoppers.Silly novelty features:The bottom of the kettle warms up a light blue when the heating element is activated.  My first thought upon seeing it was that is was a silly imitation of Cherenkov radiation but, upon further reflection, I suppose it's supposed to look like the blue flames from a gas stove.  I still think it looks silly, but it is very useful to have a visual indicator.  The novelty of having a couple of dozen LEDs shine through the water wore off very quickly, while the utility of being able to see when the kettle is heating remains.Conclusion:Overall, this is a huge upgrade from the 48oz stainless steel electric kettle we had before.  Overall, the capacity matches my needs, the improved the temperature control makes my tea better, and I really like being able to see inside the glass container and see its status from across the kitchen.  Overall, I'm very glad I bought this.

  I'd had a ceramic electric kettle for years, which broke, requiring a replacement. My husband had complained for ALL of those years about the noise level from that kettle.The HadinEEon Variable Temperature Electric Kettle does precisely what it says it will do--the variable temperature controls work beautifully. It's considerably quieter than my last one. And the fact that I can choose to keep it warm for a bit means that if I want a second cup of tea, my husband doesn't have to endure the rumbling noise of boiling water a second time. Win-win. ;) It's not light in the hand when filled with water, but it also does NOT rattle around on its base while boiling, which is good. The design is attractive, and I like the blue LED factor.I will note that the directions say to boil and pour out a first carafe of water to clean it for first use. The plate at the bottom immediately showed some spotting after that first time, so I put a mix of water and vinegar in (per the descaling directions) and boiled again, which cleared up the discolorations on the plate immediately. Word to the wise. :)

Another cool feature is the ""KEEP WARM"" button. (Nice touch.)They have addressed a flaw from the previous model with the lid not closing properly. The positioning of the new lid release latch is just a little awkward but works smoothly and the lid shuts tight the first time, everytime.Overall a wonderful product and we would recommend it to everyone.

  I owned a few kettles with temperature control. Expensive or not they all failed in one way or another, some had trouble turning off, some could not keep a consistent temperature. Some lasted very short time. Don't panic, so far this item is pretty solid.COVID update: staying at home really increased the use of the teapot 10 fold. Meaning it‚Äôs equivalent to about 10 years of my normal use. I‚Äôm happy to say the teapot is operational. Quite a few times it boiled the water away and it was all fine. The reason I‚Äôm not bumping the extra star is because I discovered another bug, when it stops reheating water. This happens quite rare, but it felt like it happens when you least expect it.  See below.cons:* temperature control is not too precise. To be more specific, ‚Äú200‚Äù is actually 205 and ‚Äú190‚Äù is 185.* keep warm should be called ""keep"" there is no option to actually keep warm (110- 130 F) water* you can't turn off the beeps.* the water filter is not aligned very well with the contour of the nozzle, so if you have some mineral deposit you might get it in your tea.* sometimes, very rarely, when it keeps certain temperature, and you pick it up and put it back, it silently stops keeping tit warm. While most of the time, as expected, it remembers the temperature for 12 hrs. I wish I can set this time myself.pros:* It works* Quite reliable: daily use while work-from-home restrictions.* Forget the water boiling? it‚Äôs ok, it will boil it away and then stop.

  The kettle stopped working within a day of me receiving it, it's blue buttons emitting blue light on and off without it turning on. Also, it's very heavy, and the multitude of metal surfaces make it risky to touch when it does turn on. I had a cheap plastic kettle before it and perhaps I'll go back to it.

  I like the appearance! But it is not perfect with the temperature. Moreover, when first time I ordered it came with completely wrong temperature sensing. Even when I set on 175F it still boiled the water. I had to replace it. The second one is working much better, but most of the times it stops heating water when temperature around 10-15 degrees higher than requested. So don't expect temperature to be as precise as you see on the buttons. But still this is more than enough to avoid boiling the water every time you want to drink a cup of tea.

  Upon receiving this kettle we noticed that it is very nice quality. The included instructions for coffee/tea heat setting was a plus.

The 12 hour keep hot timer is a major bonus compared to our old one.  We have used it for over a 120 hours so far with no problems.  The glass make it easy to tell the water level.  The blue led lights are just cool.Sept 2020 Update: Our home steel kettle died so of course I ordered this one for the house  The one at work is still going strong.  The 12 hour keep hot is now a 4 hour keep hot which is EVEN BETER and more practical.

  I love the blue lights that light up the kettle from the inside, making it easy to see when it is on and running. The whole look is beautiful and modern. It does really well keeping the tea warm but shuts off before it can boil dry (or if it is left on for several hours, like if I left for work and forgot it on). I can turn it on first thing in the morning and then go take a shower, and I know that hot water will be waiting for me when I get out, without having to babysit it. My husband likes that he can pick a different temperature from me - while I like my black tea scalding hot and use the highest setting, he makes instant coffee on the lowest setting possible. This kettle allows for that.I did have a glitch with the kettle and their customer service, for which I knocked down 1-star - it took far too many emails back and forth. They did, in the end, make it right. After a year of owning it, the kettle died. I contacted customer service by phone and did not receive the support I expected. They did much better via email though, honored the 3-year warranty, and replaced the kettle. I am back to enjoying hot tea in the mornings!For those looking to reach customer service: learn from my experience and make sure the email you are using ends in .net and not .com; their email is support@hadineeon.NET.

I was really pleased with that. What I received was a USED, DIRTY, and DAMAGED kettle inside of an OPENED and RE-TAPED box. I am seriously disgusted. I emailed them requesting a brand-new one, but this is seriously horrendous and extremely inconvenient.

Pretty disappointed that this is happening.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I LOVE this kettle! I only use distilled water in it to prevent hard water buildup and I dry off the inside of the lid and kettle after every use. The different temperature functions are fantastic and it is a very well made product. I read a lot of reviews of other kettles that said that there were problems with the unit not shutting off automatically. This product has great reviews so I went with it and I‚Äôm really glad I did. The auto shut off always works perfect and I‚Äôve never had any problems.

  Our previous electric kettle was a Capresso, purchased in 2015. We inherited in 2017 and put it through heavy, daily usage. Worked fine, but plastic handle holding the lid simply cracked off and the lid no longer stays on. Searching through reviews at Amazon, I selected the HadinEEon. It had the larger capacity we wanted.Some reviewers found a plastic smell upon opening. We did also, but a few days sitting in a sunny windowsill took care of that completely. Cleaned, dried, and used for the first time, I was pleasant surprised HOW FAST this kettle is. It is much faster than the Capresso even though the capacity is a full 1.5 cups greater with the HadinEEon.UPDATED: Still not a big fan of the many small buttons for differents temps on the handle, but it's been a quick adjustment to using the Start and the Keep Warm buttons. Because the finishing beeps are on the soft side, if I'm busy in the kitchen (range hood working, running water in the sink, etc.), the Keep Warm function has really helped. Once the kettle is lifted off the heating element, all functions are turned off.Note: the cord on this is very, very short. Be certain you can use it easily where you want to plug it in. Also, other reviewers are accurate in saying altho the kettle gives 3 short beeps when water is finished heating, they are indeed very, VERY soft. I was in the kitchen 6' away from the kettle, working on another counter, but did not hear the beeps at all!Based on reviews on Amazon for all the various electric kettles, it seems most of them have problems either within the first 4-6 months, or will go on to last at least a couple of years (all you can expect nowadays, alas). I got the inexpensive 4-yr warranty, just in case, since we use the kettle at least once a day, and often twice daily.

  I purchased this in Oct (and this review is being written on 1/6/21). We have 6 disabled adults from 3 generations in my home, and 3 of us are actually autistic. All of us are able to use this and we love it - even the person who won't use the kitchen due to his autism and fear of heated appliances. It replaced one that was 16 years old and kept tripping the power if used at the same time as the microwave. The old one was also fast as lightning - cold to boiling in less than 2 minutes (probably why it tripped the power). So, while this one is a bit slower than that one, I strongly suspect they all are judging by the descriptions of the multitude of kettles I looked at before deciding this one is our guy. It's probably a bit safer this way...lol.We love the various temp choices and the keep warm function is lovely. You can turn it on and come back in a bit and the water is exactly right.The plastic guard also protects the hand holding and pouring with the kettle from the glass so you don't get burned.It's also quite beautiful to look at both when it's heating water and also when it's just sitting on the counter.My only issue is that it's heavy so we can't fill it completely. (Our genetic issue causes joints to dislocate easily, so lifting heavy items can be difficult for us.) However, it's made of borosilicate glass, so I feel that I should have known it would be heavy. I also feel it means that they didn't cheap out on the glass, to be honest.While I spent a bit more than I had originally planned in order to get this model with all the bells and whistles, I'm really glad I did. Even my mother, who is frugal, loves this item.This kettle is a winner for my family who heavily uses it.

  I purchased this electric kettle because I wanted a larger capacity kettle and I wanted one that would look nice in our kitchen.  This 2.0 liter kettle holds enough water for both my husband's press pot and my large tea infusion.  It doesn't look that big, though, and fits easily on my countertop under my overhead cabinets.  It heats up water very quickly and has multiple heat settings for different kinds of teas and for presspot coffee and is intuitive and easy to use.  I also like the Keep Warm feature that allows me to pour what I need from the kettle and leave it at the right temp for a few minutes until my husband is ready to pour his.  My favorite thing, though, is that it is a beautiful kettle.  The clear glass and blue light are modern and sleek.  The boiling bubbles of water are mesmerizing.  I had avoided getting a kettle for years because I thought it would just add to the clutter in the kitchen.  On the contrary, this kettle actually makes my kitchen look better.

  I will say the water boils quickly and that was the best part of it. It goes downhill from there. After the first use I noticed the calcium on the bottom of the kettle. I was ready to send it back right then. I bought some jugs of distilled water and no calcium build up when using that instead of our tap water. I was willing to deal with that, but my disappointment didnt end there. My husband drinks 2-3 cups of tea to my one and the stay warm feature was the reason for buying this kettle. It worked like a champ the first few times of using it but now the stay warm no longer works. I poured my cup and my husbands cup and set the kettle back on the heat element and when I set it down the kettle shut off. So i waited awhile and started over and same thing happened. I wanted to make sure I wasnt hitting the button by accident. So now it has to go back .. it isnt even a month old.

    Works well, but I now realize it doesn't have auto-on or one-handed opening
  
",3.0,Locarno,"Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  The kettle works as advertised and seems to be good quality.  The ""keep warm"" function works well.  But I have three flaws that make me regret the purchase:1. The kettle does not automatically start heating water when power is applied, no matter what was on when power was removed.  You must plug it in and then push a button regardless of prior state.  My old single-switch kettle would start heating if it was switched on so that I could use a power timer on it, but these buttons are not mechanical.  Plus, this kettle has no delay or timer feature to make up for this.2. The kettle's glass sides shows cloudy water often and also reveals unsightly scale floating in the water.  Of course you should clean the kettle from time to time, but even a little floating scale gives me or others a bad impression, even though it doesn't affect the quality of the tea or coffee much at all.  I think an opaque kettle might be a better option.3.  Opening the lid to fill with water is not as elegant as it could be.  Other kettles enable opening it from the handle, but this kettle requires an entirely non-ergonomic two-handed approach.So in short, this kettle seems great if you don't want auto-on or a delay timer, don't mind seeing into the water, and don't mind two-handed opening.  But perhaps I'll focus on these features next time I buy one.

  After living abroad and becoming addicted to (as Ted Lasso would say) ""brown, garbage water"" I have, in the past ten years, found myself in possession of many electric tea kettles but this is the best one of the lot- it has specific settings for a variety of teas (did you know black and green brew best at different temperatures?) AND, perhaps best of all, there are a couple of below boiling settings that will allow you to fill up your evening hot water bottle without compromising the rubber. In any event, I rarely write reviews but this is purchase that, even though I deliberated for a while as the price point is high, I definitely recommend and would purchase again. Plus the blue lights and clear glass are pretty...there is something satisfying about watching your water boil and bubble.

  My last kettle lasted less than a year, so the search began.  I decided I would spend a little more money on a superior product.  I love the features this kettle has - I love match, my daughter drinks black and my husband alternates with a french press now and again so the temperature control is HUGE for us.  It's quieter and easier to clean than my previous kettle.  I've loved it until I noticed a little leak coming from the handle.  You have to love how easy Amazon makes it to return or exchange products.  I noted it on my account, and the very next day I had a replacement.  This unit does not seem to leak, so we look forward to a nice, long lasting relationship with this unit.

  This is the fourth ‚Äúcordless electric kettle I‚Äôve ordered from Amazon, but by far the best. I‚Äôve now learned that reviews do matter, and don‚Äôt chintz, because you get what you pay for.  In brief, we love this HadinEEon cordless kettle. The size, capacity, insulation, and clarity of the carafe are excellent, making it quick and easy to fill with just the right amount of water. (The makers advise against brewing tea with tea bags in the water inside; rather, pour the hot water into a separate tea pot or cups.)  You lift the hinged lid by pulling gently up and back with a fingertip notch, which puts no stress on the lid and protects your hand from exposure to steam from the spout. I like this design much better than the push-button pop-top on our previous kettle, which just stopped ‚Äúpopping‚Äù one day and couldn‚Äôt be revived.  The HadinEEon kettle has 6 temperature settings to select, right in the handle above your grip, labeled with degrees Fahrenheit and examples: for hot tea, we always choose ‚Äú190/Oolong.‚Äù The kettle heats the water quickly to your setting, then shuts itself off.  A Keep Warm button is handy for making that second cup of tea with remaining hot water.  In use, the kettle is safe and will not expose your hands to direct heat. The lid hinges down and snaps securely.  Steam will escape upward from the spout, so don‚Äôt place the kettle directly beneath cabinets, shelves or lights you don‚Äôt want to get damp.  The carafe is ‚Äúsimple‚Äù though not ‚Äúeasy‚Äù to clean, a tad cumbersome to suds the inside and rinse without jostling the lid. So I recommend using a long-handled or bottle brush. But it‚Äôs much easier just to heat water plus a little vinegar in the carafe, then dump the water and rinse it carefully out.  Note that the carafe itself is not ‚Äúcordless,‚Äù but rests flush on a flat base containing the separate heating unit, which itself plugs into an electrical outlet.  The carafe must be set *carefully* on the spindle in the center of this base.  Repeatedly wobbling it when putting it in place might wear down the connection.  But of all the kettles we‚Äôve purchased, this spindle is the largest, sturdiest, and easiest to connect to the carafe.  Note: The cord between the base and outlet is very short!  Luckily our wall outlet is already precisely where we need to hook up our coffee maker and this water kettle, so the cord is just the right length without the need for extra, precarious cords.  If your own nearest outlet is more than 2 feet away from the ideal countertop location, you‚Äôll need to use an extension cord safe for small appliances, such as for a toaster.  In sum, we love this cordless electric kettle from HadinEEon. Our only lingering question is how to pronounce HadinEEon!

  It does what It's supposed to do. I like the different temperature settings. The blue lights look nice. It's fun to watch the water boil. The only things that keep it from being perfect are that it's not very fast. I've used other kettles that heated water in half the time. It also sometimes has to stop and start a few times to hone in on a specific temperature.But those are minor issues. I'm very pleased with it. Would recommend.Update: I wrote this review because I got a card in the mail offering me $20 in amazon money for an honest review. So I wrote this review, saying that it was a good kettle but not perfect. Instead of the promised gift card I was told that I could have a $30 gift card if I changed my review from four stars to five, and credit their excellent customer service. I thought about it but eventually declined. That seemed too sketchy.Now months later they're emailing me about changing the review to 5 stars. So, I guess don't trust all those five star reviews. It's a fine kettle, I've enjoyed using it, had no problems, would recommend it to others. But the whole paying people only for five star reviews, that's a bit much. I can't even say if their customer service is that great, all I've had contact with is their overbearing marketing team.

  I use bottled water, but after only a few days the water in the kettle had white particles floating around in it and staining the bottom of the kettle. The filter on the spout doesn't filter these out.I thought the temperature options were fun but ended up using only the hottest temp as that is the only one that heats up straightaway without the stupid start/stop feature of the others that make the cooler temps longer to complete.Despite the fancy buttons for the temperature on the handle, the lid opener is clunky and located on top of the kettle so it's hot if you open it after boiling the kettle. Also, closing it is hard.Noisier than I expected too.Altogether a disappointing experience.

  I purchased the HadinEEon Variable Temperature Electric Kettle, 1200W Electric Tea Kettle, 8 Big Cups 2.0L Kettle.The Delivery was exceptionally fast. I ordered on a Saturday and received it on Monday (two days). OK I tried out the electric kettle and it worked very well on all temperature settings, along with the keep warm setting.My concern before my purchasing was not recognizing the brand name and additionally the location of the temperature buttons on the handle. However after using the product I was impressed with the way it operates and looks well made. The heat setting buttons do not interfere with my hands (fingers) when pouring. I can also easily reach into the unit to clean when needed. When the water is fully heated there is a very faint beep sound from the unit. I added a few photos to let you see how it looks and also to see the warranty data. What sold me to buy this particular unit was that it offers a 3 year parts and labor warranty and a two year money back guarantee (see photo of box and product insert and manual). Time will tell but I feel I made a good purchase.. *4 Stars ‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏èCons:1) You need to pour slowly as water will leak from the area if poured to quickly. Pour slower and it‚Äôs fine.2) Label (stencil) the other side of the glass kettle with measurements as it‚Äôs slightly inconvenient to keep turning the kettle around to see the kettle level markings.I still am enjoying this unit but with slight adjustments to my routine from my previous electric kettle, so I lowered my score from a *Five + to a *Four star score..

  Over the last year I have focused on eliminating how much/long we use our bigger kitchen appliances like the stove as well cutting my time in the kitchen. This Kettle has been a game changer for us. I primary use this to boil water when making anything that requires bring your water to a boil first. I love the fact that this kettle brings your water to a boil in little to no time. I typically transfer it to my pot on the stove and finish cooking. It cuts so much time and uses less energy which is simply a win for our house hold. I am also a heavy tea drinker and I love that this allows you to boil water to the perfect temperature depending on the type (green, black, etc) tea you are drinking. Let me note, I can tell a difference using these settings for the proper type of tea. The last feature I want to note is the ""Stay warm"" this is every mama's dream come true who have littles who will walk in the kitchen and request your attention. I love the fact that when I return I can pickup where I left off.I kettle seems extremely sturdy and takes up little space if you choose to leave it our. If you want to store it it stores easily under the cabinet as well as most upper cabinets which I also like.  After reviewing many different kettles and sizes I am happy I decided to purchase this one and after two months of constant use I can say this is the one you want to purchase hands down.

    The Best Kettle I've Ever Owned
  
",5.0,Jenn L,"Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  The title says it all: This is the Best Kettle I've ever owned!  And mind you, I've owned and replaced quite a bit of electric kettles in my life.  Admittedly, this is the first glass kettle I've owned, and I was pretty hesitant to switch over from my tried and true stainless steel kettle to glass.  But after my last Stainless Steel kettle began to discolor, (and left the heated water with a disgusting metallic taste), less than a year after receiving it - despite following the care directions to a tee - I knew I had to find a better alternative.After reviewing a bunch of glass kettles on Amazon, I was completely blown away by all the positive reviews left for the HadEEon electric kettle that I had to get it.  And boy does it not disappoint!  Not only is the kettle itself absolutely beautiful with a serene blue light illuminating the water while it's heating, but it heats the water insanely fast.  Unlike my other kettle, this kettle allows you to choose the exact heated temperature of the water - which is perfect for tea drinkers like me as water temperatures can differ depending on the type of tea being drunken.Fully washing the kettle itself is much easier than any other kettle I've owned.  Due to the large opening, it's easy to fully wash the kettle when needed without having to reach for a long dish brush - or nearly cutting your wrist open due to a narrow metal top.I highly doubt I'll ever return to a standard stainless steel kettle again, and I'm pretty sure that if anything ever happens to this kettle, I'll be happy to purchase the exact same brand without hesitation.

  I bought this kettle in July. 6 months it started boiling uncomfortably by evaporating all the water and putting my family in a very unsafe situation. Good thing we are home to unplug the kettle. I have never had a kettle going bad in 6 months. Do yourself a favor and look for more reputable and tested brands.I would like to add to this review -  about 2 weeks ago I was contacted by the manufacturer asking me how they can help me with my experience. I told them I already purchased a new kettle from a more reliable brand. Then they offered me $100. I thought they were trying to reimburse me for my additional expense and said I would accept their refund. Then they asked me to remove my comment and only after that they will pay me $100. I sent them an email stating that their Kettle is a safety hazard and put my family, my house and my neighbors in a safety situation if I was not home when the kettle started boiling at a high temperature on its own. I also told them that I would be willing to modify my comment if they told me what is being done to remedy the situation with their kettle so future buyers are safe. I never heard from them again. Please be very careful with this kettle as I am not the only one who had this safety issue.

  I am using my new kettle today for the first time.  Of course, it is shiny and new, but I am impressed by the elegant design.  I wondered if it would be too heavy, but I wanted a larger kettle anyway.  The placement and shape of the handle makes it quite comfortable and easy to maneuver, even though it is much bigger than my old kettle.  I also really enjoy the glass body with the led lighting around the bottom when it is heating.  It actually makes ""watching water boil"" entertaining!I enjoy many different types of hot drinks, and I appreciate the variable heat feature on this appliance.  Some flavors of tea or coffee are released better with lower temperatures, and this kettle gives me that option.It is very quick. I did not time the heatings, but I was surprised at how quickly it reached boiling, even though it contains almost eight cups of water.This kettle also has a ""keep warm"" feature, which I anticipate using quite often.  Especially if several people are having hot drinks, it will be very nice to have the hot water available without having to re-heat the kettle each time.As I said, this is my first day to use my new kettle, so I really haven't found anything negative to say about it.  We will see how durable it is, and if it continues to perform as well in future as it is today.Overall, I would rate this product as an excellent purchase, and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys hot drinks.

  My previous kettle from a different seller failed after 1 yr. I had enjoyed the variable temperature setting but found few vendors that supported this. The HadinEEon has variable temperature support and a 3 year warranty so I ordered it. It is working well, but a few items that are not as good as the previous kettle:  the shape is a bit funny and more difficult to handle that one that is taller and thinner. To fill the kettle is not as easy - the lid needs to be snapped back and then forcibly closed. I worry that it will wear out. The beep when the temperature has been reached is very hard to hear.

",5.0,Melissa M.,"Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased my first kettle July, 2019 and used it for awhile until one day my cappuccino got cold so I decided to put it in the pot and heat it up (since I didn't want to use a microwave and alter the taste, etc) - well I was getting ready for work and didn't stand there and watch it. when I came back it was boiling over - the sugars I assume in the cappuccino got bubbly and boiled over so when I took the pot off the base the base has cappuccino on it and I ruined my pot - no kidding.  I do not fault the manufacturer. I didn't read the directions, so perhaps the directions say not to use a sugary liquid in the pot? I don't know - anyway  #1 I should not have walked off, #2 I should not have put anything in there with sugar that could boil over.My best advice is just to ONLY use it for WATER and that takes care of any guess work.  After I ruined the first pot - it did last me a whole 6 months before I managed to find a way to ruin a perfectly great device. I bought my second pot - did not hesitate.  Purchased my second pot Jan, 2020 and have only used it for water and it is working fine. It is hands down my favorite addition to the kitchen - no more using the microwave to heat water. I know that sounds crazy but I use filtered water, so I could use hot water out of the tap, but that is not filtered, so it makes more sense to continue to filter my water and then use this pot to heat it up - its way faster that putting it in a sauce pan on the stove.Make things super simple. Can use it for hot drinks but also for cooking (e.g instant mashed potatoes, and other things).What I really like about it too are the different temperature suggestions for tea. I have all kinds of hot teas I drink and it helps to have an idea what temperature to not go over for the type of tea you are about to brew (e.g, delicate, green, white oolong) and there is a setting for french press or black.Since we also use a french press - this pot was perfect and I don't have to look up what temperature to stop at or set it at each time. This clever device is so handy and helpful. I just love it.I would definitely recommend and buy another one again when this one wears out.I would still give it a five stars even though I ruined the first pot - I felt like it was my own fault for either not reading the directions or for walking off - so for whatever its worth - its still a great kitchen appliance.

  I've owned several electric kettles over the last 10 yrs. Frankly, like toasters these days, they are not built to last...This time I decided to spend a little more. I think it was worth it. It feels like it is better made, heartier. I like the idea of the different water temperatures although I have not found the need to use yet since I use for black tea or plain boiled water primarily. Follow the directions for cleaning prior to use. It is a MUST. They are all treated with some horrible chemicals, so cleaning before using very important.It has a a wide opening. The top flips open so you could put your hand in. Other kettles often only partially open and noticed is a con in many other kettle reviews. Gives a couple of unobtrusive beeps when done. My only other common sense comment would be if you have filled it more than half way, advise against aggressively pouring out because it will spill. That is true of other kettles as well. Probably due to the filter spout insert. Regardless, that may be a safety feature to keep from over pouring and burning yourself.I recommend this kettle and would buy again or for someone else.

  I use this kettle almost every day for coffee, tea, and whatever else needs hot water.Usage is simple: press the button for the heat setting that you want (Delicate, Green, White, Oolong, French Press, Black), and then press Start / Stop. You can also press Keep Warm if you'd like the kettle to hold the temperature for a 10 minutes or so. The water will glow blue when the kettle is heating and the light will turn off when it is cooling. It will beep once the desired temperature is reached.The temperature is fairly accurate (194 degrees measured at French Press 200 degree mode) and heating is pretty quick (2:40 to boil 2 cups of water from 76 degree room temperature).My last kettle died because water penetrated the control buttons, which were located on the base of the heater. This kettle has a more compact base and the controls are not in danger of major spills.I only have one complaint: the top lid needs to be securely snapped or water will sometimes splash outside of the spout. Make sure that you snap it firmly or you may spill when pouring quickly.

  This kettle is great. Upon opening the box, it was a bit larger than I had anticipated. I set it up and boiled water in it and dumped it per the instructions. I then filled the kettle to the max line, hit 212 degrees, and the 2L of water boiled in approximately 4-5 Minutes.There is a faint beeping when the water reaches the desired temperature, which was difficult to hear in my very loud home, but I would imagine it is easily heard in the wee hours of the morning when its early and you need that Tea/Coffee. Along with the beep, the LED lights shut off which also notify you.The LED lights are impressive and make the kettle look very cool and modern. I really liked that feature.The buttons are nice and easily pressed with very straightforward instructions.I have EXTREMELY hard water and have to descale anything that uses water regularly, if not replace altogether. I can already tell that there is scaling starting to form on the bottom. I would imagine a weekly vinegar brew will be necessary, but again, this is no fault of the product.All in all, I really like this kettle and appreciate the warranty that comes with it.Thanks Hadineeon!

  This tea kettle is well made and works well.  We use it daily and it has been put through its paces.  The temperature control is great.  the only ""downside"" is not due to the kettle, it is the quality of water you put in.  If you have water with a lot of dissolved solids you will have to clean this regularly.  It is not overly difficult but a slight scale build-up will occur over time.  There is a screen mesh that prevents any loose sediment from getting into your drink should you not clean it but it is best to keep it clean.The base is solid and it heats water pretty quickly.  The best part is the temperature control, it will maintain the water temp you set if you prefer for 4 hours.  Nice for warm-ups.You do have to be careful not to damage the glass.  It is pretty rugged but it is glass.  I like it better than metal or non-see-thru carafes because you can see when it is clean.All in all, it is a very nice electric kettle.  Use quality filtered water and this will make you an excellent cup of tea.

  This is actually the third style of kettle I've gotten and it is my favorite.  I've gotten one with the rotary dial but it was difficult to dial in the temperature each time; I also got one that you can enter in the exact temperature but I didn't feel safe using it as the control pad generated heat when not in use and it also took a little extra effort to set the temperature each time I wanted to change the type of tea I was making.  The buttons on this one are actually easier and faster to use.  Quality is higher than expected making this a good value.  The keep warm feature is nice because I often get distracted by the dog or kids while making tea.  And of course it's accuracy....within 5 degrees every single time which is what I was looking for.  I got tired of using an instant thermometer every time and bought this kettle.  So happy I did.  Love the slightly larger size too.  Perfect for my needs.  The tapered shape seems to help evenly distribute the heat  through the entire kettle also.  Love having six different settings.  I use them all!

  Does exactly what I needed. Convenient to have the temperature presets; I could imagine wanting to have finer control over precise temperatures, but honestly I can't imagine what I could use that for, and it would probably involve more time to punch in than the very simple interface it currently has.The blue LED lights on the bottom look great as the water is heating. If you use a setting other than full-boil/""black"" tea, then once it reaches a certain point it will stop heating (and the lights go off), allowing the water to cool (or rather, to heat more slowly, using only whatever heat energy is still on the hot plate), and then turn on again, alternating back and forth with about 1-to-2-second ""on"" cycles, until it's satisfied with the temperature, and beeps 6 times. The beeps are plenty audible, though I might wish them to be a tad louder when I have a lot of white noise going on, such as a ""portable"" AC unit going full blast, with the stove fan on. Even then, I was able to hear it fine if I was nearby.

    Great for tea, coffee, heating water for the baby's milk!

  Really neat way to warm water! Preset buttons work well to get your water to the exact temperature you need for coffees and teas. I like the glass wall on this one so I can see what's going on inside of the pot! Makes for a nice experience with the neat lighting they put inside!I had a different brand unit, a Cuisinart one that was solid brushed stainless steel and I could not see inside to identify when there was a calcium build-up. This one is much better for that reason. Also the opening on this one is much larger making it easier to clean.One downside I have noticed so far are because of the shape of the mouth I cannot use this one to get water from my refrigerator filter built into my refrigerator door. That's not a deal-breaker though I just use a cup to fill it.The other thing I am a little bit nervous about are these buttons. They just feel soft, like they will wear quickly, but I could be wrong about that so I will update this review if they do.Please note I was given this unit in exchange for a review. I have tried not to let that affect my partiality.

  First, I've only had this thing for two days so keep that in mind.  If it blows up tomorrow I'll append my review, but keep in mind it has a three year warranty.Now, for what you want to know:It's big; eight cups is a lot.  That's good for me because I brew a lot of iced tea.  But if you're looking for something petite, this is not for you.  Of course you don't have to fill it up, but it's large compared to most others I've seen.It keeps the water at the temperature you select; I tested it with my kitchen thermometer and it works.  I did not test it for twelve hours, but I tested the warming feature.It get's hot quickly; I didn't time it, but it does.The individual temperature settings work as well or better than I thought they would; they are close most of the time.  This may change as the machine is used; I don't know.  But I tested them.  The 160 setting hit 156 and stayed there.  175 was closer to 170.  185 stayed at around 181.  200 hit it right on the money.  212; it boiled aggressively.  Perfect, no.  But close enough for me.  I think to get perfect precision you'd have to pay through the nose.I like the fact that the manufacturer included recommended temperatures for brewing a long list of teas and stuff. No big deal, but thoughtful.Construction is not industrial strength.  If you don't abuse it I suspect it will be fine.  It doesn't feel flimsy, just lightweight.  Treat it like glass (oh, yeah, it IS glass) and it should hold up well.  And you have the warranty.One more thing, I read a negative review whining that the company bribed him/her to write a 5-star review.  That's not exactly true.  There is an insert in the paperwork that says if you will write a review and forward the documentation of purchase and review to the company they will give you one of six gifts.  One of the gifts is a $10 Amazon gift card.  Nowhere in the offer does it say you have to give a great review, or even a good one; just tell people what you think.My thinking at this point is just that the company thinks they have a good product.  But if I don't get my $10 you'll hear about it.

  It did work quite well for the first 3 months of use (not every single day use), however for the last month, it seemed to have some issues occasionally and wouldn't always turn on.  Finally quit completely 2 days ago. My previous Hamilton Beach electric kettle worked great for 3 years... This one worked great for 3 months... Not impressed.  For the extra cost of this kettle, you could get 2 kettles that will last you about 6 years combined. I would not buy this kettle again.

    Kettle has been great and is used daily since working at home
  
",5.0,Trevor Joseph,"Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  Once I started working at home everyday back in March 2020 I quickly discovered that I missed the hot water always available at the office.  I looked to get a water kettle soon after.I do not drink coffee but instead I add some caffeinated flavoring (such as Mio) to hot water and use that as my pick-me-up in the morning.  Either that or hot chocolate added to hot water.  I am very happy that I decided on this model.  I like that it is see-through so I always know the level of water remaining and makes it easy to add water without overfilling.  The light at the base of the kettle lets me know it is heating and keeping the water hot.The main reason I picked this model is because it allows the user to choose the temperature of water it heats to.  I do not like scalding hot water and many kettles will heat to boiling temps and I have to wait until it cools down a bit. This has 6 different choices for how hot it gets the water and is a feature I really appreciate. I understand that certain coffees and teas are best served at various temperatures so that feature would be helpful to most people I am sure.I also really love the feature that has the kettle keeping the water steady at my chosen temperature for 4 hours.  That way I can just start it up as soon as I walk in to the kitchen in the morning and I can come back to it several times before lunch and refill again knowing that it will be at the right temp for me.It has been going strong for 9 months now with regular use.  I am very happy that I chose this kettle and would recommend it to whomever is looking for one.

    Great Kettle!
  
",5.0,Lubka,"Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had a plastic kettle I previously bought from Amazon during Prime day years ago, and loved. I loved it because it let me pick the temperature of the water, based off the type of tea I was making, which is quite often in my household. When my other kettle broke, I went to replace it with the same model, but found out that over the years the other company was cutting corners by making the kettle with cheaper products (that also broke faster) and raised the price of the unit. So began my new kettle search. I love the fact that this kettle is glass, better for me and the environment. The kettle holds SO much water. I can now easily boil large quantities of water, for my summer iced tea, in one go instead of having to empty and refill 3 or 4 times. The blue light is very pretty, as others have mentioned, and is a great indicator (especially at night) when the water is done boiling. This is a kettle that is on the larger size, which is great for me, and looks good on my counter. I would recommend purchasing this kettle if you're on the fence..

    Nice Kettle but be Careful of the Stay Warm Feature
  
",3.0,Michael S.,"Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  The Kettle heats water as described. I paid the extra for this Kettle because of the stay warm feature. The stay warm feature works by bring your water up to the temperature you choose and then when it drops below a certain point it heats it back up to your set temp over and over again. We use the high setting but had to stop using the stay warm feature because once, it kept reheating to the point that the water was almost completely gone (less than 1 inch in the kettle) with the remaining water having a strong metallic taste and a second time it boiled the water over and over again until it was completely evaporated. I worry that had I forgotten about it for longer the water would have completely evaporated and the heating element may have started a fire.

  I started use this kettle for my daily hot ware.  At first it worked fine, and added a beautiful color in our kitchen. However I was stunted less than three weeks later. I saw some dark yellow spots inside the kettle, one sat on the bottom, another two sat on the circle where the glass meets the bottom. They really look like rust. I was really shocked because the kettle makes me drink a lot of unknown element. My first guess is that the manufacture used non-stainless steel instead of  stainless steel to save money, of course, his own money. I have returned it. I do hope that Amazon should have checked product quality and the manufacture's reputation before providing platform for them.

  I needed one of these for my wife who drinks tea. She was heating water on the stove and forgot about it enough times that we both thought it would be a good idea to get an electric kettle. We are very happy with this purchase. Delivery was fast. The box was pristine. It's very simple to use. The reason you should buy this one in particular is the keep warm feature which most of the other electric kettles do not have. If you have the keep warm feature you can turn the kettle on and walk away for up to 12 hours, and the water will be at the temperature you set it for. Without that feature any kettle will simply turn off when it reaches the set temperature and begin to cool off, and you might have to cycle it again by the time you get back. It also holds a full 2 liters, most of the others are a little smaller. This one wasn't the least expensive, but the keep warm, the extra size, and the 3 year warranty and 1 year money back guarantee are worth more. Great gift idea for anyone you know that needs hot water for things like tea.

  This pot replaced another model I've had for years and it is such a total upgrade! I love that it is clear and I can easily see the water level. It also holds more water than my other pot without an increased footprint. My old pot did not have different temps or a keep warm function and now I don't know how I lived without those features. I can bring water to the correct temp for specific teas and keep it there. I don't have to guess at how hot it is or keep waiting for the water to heat up again when I want to make another cup. Despite the additional features it is still easy to use. I have an adult son with Down Syndrome that enjoys a cup of hot cocoa every night and he likes making it himself. I was afraid the additional settings would get too confusing for him, but after trying out a few temps we decided on the one he liked best and he has no trouble using it to warm up his water. The controls are super easy and intuitive. It is also very easy to clean - much easier than my old pot because of the wider opening and because it is clear so I can actually see what I'm doing better. It also heats up quickly.  I've only had it a week but we've used it every  day, multiple times a day and I really love it.

  ¬†At least I think it is as it's still been pretty warm out in Cali! However, I am ready now with this convenience item. I've been wanting to try an electric kettle and replace my old stove top one that leaks when it boils so decided to test this one out.*PROS: Fast heat - you can see the bubbles fairly quickly once you've pressed start, large capacity (8 cups), looks nice on the counter, variable temp settings to give your different beverages optimal taste & a stay warm feature if you need to keep hot water for a length of time.*CONS: I wish the lid came off all the way as I think that would make it even easier to clean, the stay warm feature expires after 20 seconds once you remove from base which seems short and you feel a bit rushed, the lighting is cute but some might find it gimmicky - however, it's helpful in letting you know when it's on.BOTTOM LINE: I really like this electric kettle and will be using it a lot in the coming cold months.

  I bought this because I kept starting my gas fire kettle and then forgetting about it.  I was concerned there was going to be a fire.  This blue light kettle device had high ratings.  I have been very happy with it.  I use it almost every day.  It takes just a few minutes to boil water.  I like the multiple heat settings but for me I always use it at the 212 degree setting.  I never use the ""keep warm"" feature because I might forget and boil off all my water.  The blue light looks really cool.  Just be careful because it does use a lot of electricity, I ran it and a toaster and the microwave at the same time and tripped a circuit breaker.  But that is not a negative just something to be cautious about.  Anyway this has been a very useful device to me, and like I said I use it almost every day and most days more than once.  It is intuitive to use, my daughter came home and used it no problem.  Useful device, thank you.

  I just moved into my own apartment after 8 years of renting rooms in other people's houses. This kettle was the FIRST thing I purchased on Amazon for my new space, even before I actually moved in! (Sheltering at a friend's house for weeks. #thankscovid19) From April 30th to today -- nearly 3 months, I have used this kettle EVERY. SINGLE. DAY., no exaggeration. I use it for tea (LOVE that it has different temperature settings for more delicate teas!), and for boiling water I need to make bouillon with quickly when the soup I'm making gets too thick. This kettle is fast!I also love the Keep Warm function, which by the way doesn't really mean ""warm,"" it means whatever temperature you have it set at! I know Myself, and sometimes I put the water on for tea, then get sidetracked and forget about it for an hour - or 2, or 3, or... you get the idea. If I've pushed the keep warm button, though, the water is as piping hot as it was when it first reached temperature. There are absolutely no cons to this kettle. Oh! Oh! Oh! I almost forgot! I also love that the base isn't attached to the kettle like many I've seen. You can take the kettle where you need it, set it down on the counter or table without worrying about the heating element, which is part of the base.Buy this kettle; I predict you'll be very happy you did. Stay safe, everyone!

  We had a name brand stainless steel electric kettle from the BB&B store and it was so convenient.  Liked everything about it except that the only way to see the level was through a small glass leveling tube on the side and there is really no way to clean that part.  Decided to get a glass kettle so you can see and clean everything.  After comparing kettles this one seemed to have the most consistent positive reviews, but was a little more expensive I believe for the extra temp options and the cool LED's.  The options are nice, but really we just wanted a well built and reliable one so were willing to pay a little extra for it.  We've had it a couple months and it's been great.  The whole glass kettle lights up to let you know it's on, and the different temp options are actually pretty nice.  I like there are no tubes or areas that are hard to clean so clean up is a breeze.  So far this is the perfect electric kettle.

  I wanted to wait a bit before reviewing this kettle so that I could give an accurate review. I have been using this daily since it arrived and we love it. The labels on the buttons help us know what temp to brew at but - even more useful is the guide chart in the instruction booklet because it gives even more varieties of tea and which temp to choose for them. It is compact on my counter even though it has a large water capacity and it is super pretty- love the blue lights. The only con I can give you is that I wish the keep warm function had a better time window... I will explain, it only remembers to keep warm at the temp you choose if you put it back on the base within a 20 second window. Maybe I am just slow, but for me it takes a bit longer to pour my water and replace the pot on the base. Just extending that to 30 seconds would make a huge difference for me personally. Other than that - we have really enjoyed our tea so much more with the ability to choose the temperature and this kettle has been amazing. I de-scaled it for the first time today and it cleaned up like a breeze. So glad we decided to take the plunge on this one!

I'm a child of the 80's, if it lights up that gives it automatic cool points. Before I got this in was boiling my tea water in a pot on the stove like a savage.

I'm using it with a GE reverse osmosis water source and I can easily fit the kettle under the spout. I have small adult hands and will be able to reach inside, if needed.I also like that there's no plastic with the boiling part. Since it's a glass kettle, no plastic is used for the viewing window.

  I purchased this three months ago after I got good and sick of my other electric water kettle leaking from the bottom. I chose the HadinEEon because of the size and the variable temps. When I received it, it was packed well and I was able to pull it out if the box, wash, and fill with water. Used it right away. It takes longer than my previous kettle to boil water because it holds more water. However, it works great. All the different temps work just fine, although I have not used a thermometer to check for accuracy. The blue light is lovely to look at in the middle of the night when everyone else is asleep and I am making tea.The only drawback is that the bottom of the unit, between the borosilicate glass and the metal, has discolored. It is supposed to be made from stainless steel so I am not sure how it happened, but it did...see pic. This, however, has not changed the product quality, just the beauty.The size is a full 8 cups with variable temperature control. It's exactly as I expected.

    Good Set of Features
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2021","









  
  
    
  I had been using all metal kettle to boil water for tea. Plain water from that kettle had a metallic taste to it (the taste I am trying to describe still exists with this kettle but it seems less pronounced). I began to look for a glass kettle for this reason, and because a documentary leads me to think a glass kettle would be better for health. I paid more to get this kettle from my final choices for glass kettles because of the preprogrammed temperatures for the different types of tea. I am very satisfied with making that choice.I noticed a couple of issues at first and then came to see they were at my end. I first thought the cord was a bit short but I then discovered that I had not fully pulled it out. Also, I usually put water to the min or 2 cup setting, as is my general practice. Its larger size requires a greater tilt, which would cause steam to flow across my hand during the pour. I realized that I was holding its handle near the top out of habit (from using the smaller kettle) and grasping the handle further below fixed that issue.I like the following features:- LEDs give a visual cue about when water is being heated. You can step away from the kettle and know from a distance when the water is ready, or despite other loud kitchen sounds.- You need a twist tie to manage extra length of the power cord on some appliances. This kettle lets you wrap extra cord underneath it for cleaner cord management.- The markings on the kettle make it easier to use just the amount of water you need.- I most often make green tea. Heating it only to the temperature needed for green tea lets me each get a better brew, and it takes less time for the water to be ready.One advantage my older kettle had on this one is that it had a higher wattage and, thus, offered faster heating. My use of the green tea makes this a moot point for me since my water seems to be ready more quickly than it did with the old kettle since I am heating to lower than a boiling temperature. I imagine I would notice the difference if I were going for full boiling temperature.I have had this product for 6 months with daily use. I got another as a gift for family.

  This product is well designed and functions as expected. There are 3 types of settings - 6 buttons with different temperature settings (for various types of teas and coffee) + ""start/stop"" button + and a ""keep warm"" button.  The blue light adds a touch of beauty to its design. One feature I am still getting used to (a difference from my previous very simple electric cattle) - is before the water boils, it looks like the cattle is turning on and off multiple times. Once I understood that this a normal signal which indicates that boiling is about to be done, it all made sense. The water is fully boiled once the cattle beeps four times. Very happy with the purchase.The seller also promises an appreciation gift in exchange for a review - you can choose from 6 different options (about $15 value each). I am leaving a review, because I typically do when I am very happy or unhappy with a product, but this might be a nice incentive for some buyers - so I'm adding this piece of information in. It also tells me that this seller is committed to a quality customer care.

  I started looking for an electric kettle so I could keep my water warm for a decent period of time.  I was using a kettle on the stove and had to reheat it when ever I wanted a new cup of tea.  This was one of the only kettles I found that has a 4 hour keep warm feature and I am very happy with it.  I put on the kettle in the AM and then again in the afternoon if I need it.  I usually heat some water in the evening for bedtime.  The water is always ready and I can change the temperature each time I use it.  Green tea in the AM and then warm water in the afternoon and in the evening I use the water to fill a hot water bottle for my feet in bed.  Super pleased with how this kettle functions.  It was worth the extra money to have the water stay warm for 4 hours a time.  My sister had a hot pot that I think must have been insulated because there was always hot water on her countertop until it ran dry and shut off.  I tried to find something like that from the 90's and all they had were huge ones for meetings or offices.  This is definitely a great choice for a personal size kettle.  It keeps me drinking more water during the day if it is warm.  I was running the sink until the water got warm and that wasted a lot of water.  As far as cleaning.  I just add some vinegar to the bottom before going to bed once a week and the next morning I rinse it out and start new water for the day.  I hope you enjoy yours as much as I do mine.

    Immpressive heating power with GREAT features
  
",5.0,Chris P Bacon,"Reviewed in the United States October 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  I loved this electric kettle out of the box (which was very well packaged).  The durable heating pad had a great manually retractable cord which allows the user to eliminate a dangerous cord hanging out to be tripped over or snagged causing the kettle to spill.  The operating instructions were simple and straight forward leaving little doubt how to operate effectively and which is the best temperature to use for your drink of choice (lengthy menu  of drinks/temp. provided in the instructions.  The blue light ( i think there are other light color options available) is really cool as to know the kettle is functioning properly and that it may be HOT.  I really like the KEEP WARM feature that doesn't require the user to continually turn on/off the unit for desired results.  I also thought the filtration screen on the pour spout was a nice touch and can be seen in the boiling pot picture I have included with this review.  I would definitely recommend!!!

    Love HadinEEon Variable Temp Electric Kettle
  
",5.0,Tony Sr,"Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is our second HadinEEon electric kettle.  We were familiar with the high quality and really nice design and appearance of their product and thought the new version with its variable temperature feature and ability to hold temperature looked a nice add.  And it is.As with our first HadinEEon kettle, the family liked it immediately and the new features have been put to good use.  Our children‚Äôs families liked the first kettle and the response to this new one is even better with its new features.  We had no appreciation of how nice, and convenient, it is to keep water hot for use during certain times of the day.These kettles just make everyone smile as they use it. We are now a two-kettle family as making water hot has become a family ‚Äòdestination.‚Äô  I am sure more kettles are in our future as gifts to the kids.This is really just a great product.

    Works well and looks good with some tradeoffs
  
",4.0,Hagay Dvir,"Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  The kettle certainly looks great and works very well. However, there are some design compromises that you need to be aware of. First off, it trades speed for temperature accuracy. To get accurate temperature, it uses a lower output heat element and cycles the krttle on and off when it gets close to the desired temperature, a process that takes about 2 minutes to complete. Second, it trades design and style for usability with buttons to select the temperature you want directly but no display of what the current or selected temperature is. Lastly, it has a really good keep warm feature but pretty whimpy buzzer to let you know the water is heated.All in all a great kettle for the price, especially if you care strongly about heating water to exactly 200 F or any of the other presets the kettle supports.

    This kettle hits all the spots!
  
",5.0,Iago,"Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  First, it's a 2L high capacity kettle, more than an average 1.7L kettles being sold on amazon.  Second, it is glass and metal construction, which is a lot safer than plastic kettles, as they don't release chemicals into the water.  Slide lock mechanism on the lid, which ensures that it's locked when pouring.  The glass let's you easily see how much water is in the kettle, and the LED light shows you that the kettle is heating the water, even if you are checking from across the room.  The sound indicates the water has reached a desired temperature, and the LED light turns off.  The buttons are logically laid out, and are clearly labeled; great for making tea!  The construction is top notch, so it should last a while!  Overall, extremely satisfied!  Relatives have been asking where I got it, so I'll be ordering a few more!

    So much better than our Keurig
  
",5.0,Ryan & Alexandra,"Reviewed in the United States November 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  We used a Keurig for years. It seems like it is convenient because you just plop a pod in the coffeemaker and push a button. But it is actually not. Getting the pods is a pain and they are very expensive. Plus, you are drinking coffee that has gone directly through plastic. That cannot be healthy. Besides, the water sits in that machine for a long time and you cannot clean it. Yuck. We ditched it in favor of this electric kettle and a french press. The whole set up cost a lot less than a Keurig and is way more healthy. Plus the coffee actually tastes good because you can use whatever you like. The kettle has been easy to clean and as long as we open the lid once it is empty, it dries and we haven't had any issues with rust. If you are on the fence, just buy this. You'll be glad you did.

",5.0,Keith O'Bryan,"Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  Basically what the headline says - I only really have a hotplate in my kitchen, and up until now mornings before work consisted of putting my little old metal kettle on the hotplate and just checking the temperature periodically while grinding my coffee. Usually it'd take almost half an hour to get my morning coffee, despite my using the Aeropress, and a LOT of that was due to the hotplate and the kettle.And with this electric kettle, which not only got water to the temperature I needed much faster and lot more reliably without me having to check constantly, also freed up the hotplate. In the time it used to take to make one cup of coffee I am now capable of making three cups of coffee while cooking breakfast. This kettle is fast, consistent, and reliable, and I love it.

  I drink hot water all day!  usually with green or herbal tea.  I was finding my tea tasted burnt while using an old electric kettle that just indiscriminately boiled water, even after washing and descaling that old kettle.  I saw this and thought how perfect!  It has a guide for temperatures appropriate for different teas versus coffee and that keep warm setting is extraordinaire!  The one glitchy thing is it seems to flip on and off  as the water gets ""close to the set temperature""  it really put me off... but that is explained in the directions ---still weird tho... is my water done?  or not???  I got this on a great sale... but the price went up BIGTIME!  when I went to buy one as a gift :(  So right now, I think its a bit pricy as I paid over $15 less than the list price just last week!

",4.0,Nic,"Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2021","









  
  
    
  Follow the cleaning instructions to get the best possible use out of the machine itself. Scaling aka build-up will increase over time especially due to the hardness of your water but if you clean it say every couple of weeks you will limit the buildup for better tasting water. The bottom of the kettle does have a circular scale to it that seems to have been eaten away at the metal but then again properly cleaning will prevent deposits from entering your water and ultimately entering your body. Would buy again.

    Excellent variable temp kettle
  
",5.0,Emily Ravenwood,"Reviewed in the United States August 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is an excellent kettle, overall. The water heats fast, the temperature is on target, the pre-sets are perfect, and the keep-warm feature is a godsend to someone like me who wants multiple steeps over the course of a few hours. The one caveat I have is: DO NOT LEAVE IT FILLED WHILE STANDING COLD. Empty it when you're done. The seal around the heating element is not completely tight, when it's cold. And, okay, I'd rather have a long-lasting kettle that allows for expansion and contraction, yes, and the leak is not a fast one, but that was still annoying.EDITED TO ADD: Vendor contacted me, collected info about leak to pass back to R&D types, and offered a partial refund on my replacement kettle to make things good. Excellent customer service, and the new kettle has had no leaks at all!

  I liked this Kettle among many other options I can buy from Amazon. The price, the fact that it takes 2.0 liters NOT 1.7 and also the neatness of the whole thing.  I will watch it closely as we heavily using it for an office not in a house. I wonder if anyone has been using it for longer period of time. Other than that it is an excellent kettle.We have been using it now heavily and I really don't see anything wrong with it. You choose from several options of temperature. Also, I liked the beep when it finishes heating. This is in addition to the LED blue light that will blink and goes off when heating is finished. The wattage is the right one for a fast and stable heating process. Also the opening and closing of the glass kettle is well done that won't allow an exposure to heat or anything like that.  I surely recommend it for your tea, coffee and other hot drinks ‚òïüçº

    Exceeds expectations, just watch your altitude
  
",5.0,TMoyer,"Reviewed in the United States October 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  It works very well and quickly. The keep warm feature is nice and I like that it has preset temperature controls for various types of teas. We have very hard water here, but it's remained clean and scale free. It is important to empty it when done and leave the lid open. This helps reduce buildup.Water tastes clean with no plastic-taste, a new change from the old plastic kettle I had before.The only issue I've had is due to the altitude I'm at, not the device. At nearly 4000 ft, setting the device to 212 degrees results in it continuing to boil the water without shutting off. This is because water can't hit 212 degrees at this altitude. But setting it at 200 works just fine. The other safety features are a nice touch, specifically for this situation.

  2/17/2020 Update - My original review below, did not include a Customer Service field when the site populated the  review fields.  After turning in that review, I was contacted today (the day after) and the store'c Customer Service department reached out and asked how they could make me happier, they were not happy because I was not 100% happy. So let me say this.  There is nothing they can do about the ring in the pot. But the way they reached out and wanted to address my concern, and let me know that the product has a three year warranty, and a one year money back guarantee - I found to be impressive. So for, the Customer Service and focus on Customer Satisfaction, I want it to be made clear that the store is top-rate. Overall rating is a 5 star experience.2/16/2020 OK, so I received a request to review this product after I received the one I ordered, which is not a regular thing. I figured why not, I have things to say about this electric teapot.So here are the LIKES: 1st  Like- love the glass; it allows me to see if the water level is low, and I can see how clean I am getting the pot. (Rated 3 stars for Easy to clean - because it is easy to clean less the heat ring issue - further explained below)2nd Like- the LED light makes it fun to watch.3rd Like- this pot heats your water fast, wastes no time.4th Like - the buttons have the temp and the type of beverage it is suitable for - i.e., 212 says ""Black"", 200 says French Press - the paperwork that comes with it tells you this and more.5th Like - It takes up very little counter space.6th Like - The glass is somewhat thicker than my coffee carafe for my coffee maker.7th Like - it is well balanced even at its fullest. I do not feel like I cannot hold or control the pour of the kettle.Now the ""could improve"" items:1st be weary issue - Not that I expected anything different, because glass is a good heat conductor, but the pot gets hot. So the drawback for the lights is, if you have little ones who can move chairs and climb to the counter level, be sure they know they ""DO NOT TOUCH THE POT WITH THE FUN BUBBLES AND THE PRETTY LIGHT"".2nd could improve issue - my home has a whole-house filter, and I have a filter in my fridge, and a filter under my kitchen sink. Thus the water I use is double filtered, however - the pot has still developed a scale or heat ring inside on the bottom that is NOT easily removed.  I actually need to use 1200 grit wet sand paper to remove it. I have never heated water int he pot with less than 4 cups of water. I am not sure if I used store bought water if this would have occurred anyway. Would be great to try it and see - maybe someone will post here about that.Even though it has a couple of flaws, as I listed, I still recommend the pot - because I do really enjoy it!Final note: The measurements are actual baking measurements - it is not like a coffee pot where the cups are based on 6 ounces (or 3/4 cup baking measurement). So 4 cups is truly 1 litre.

  My boss got me thinking about an electric kettle after she brought one into the office.  After doing a little research, I chose this one because of the variety of heat settings and the ""keep warm"" feature along with high ratings.  I felt the price point was fair for a good quality item, and I have not been disappointed.While you certainly can brew an entire pot of tea right in the kettle, I use it for hot water exclusively, and then make individual cups of tea, as well as hot water to make broth from boulliion for recipes, and now for making my instant Keto coffee in the morning.  I have also used it to add enough hot water to cold potatoes to loosen them up enough for mashing, adding milk & butter afterwards.  Worked great!I found the instructions to be just a little lacking.  For example, I wondered if it would shatter the glass to add more cold, filtered water from my refrigerator to a pot of hot water.  I'm guessing it could so I have not tested this, but the directions offer no warnings like this.I am happy with my purchase and feel it is worth giving up a few inches of counter space. I use it almost every day.

  We used to use a thermometer and timer to verify the correct temperature before adding tea leaves.  This new tea kettle allows one to set the temperature for steeping each type of tea.  The kettle reaches the preferred temperature quickly and  beeps when that temperature is reached.  If I had a quibble it would be that the button to open the kettle top in order to add warer isn't spring loaded one needs to lift the top after using the button release which is awkward if the kettle is still quite warm.  Otherwise, well designed

  I ordered this kettle for our office. I love that this is a 2.0L capacity!  It‚Äôs a pretty glass with blue led lights and fun to actually see the water boiling. The temperature settings are a must as we drink a variety of teas. The keep warm for four hours feature is awesome so that water can be ready pretty much instantly when you need it. It was half the price of our other kettle we use in home. Plus it comes with a one year money back guarantee and a 3 year warranty!  They also send you detergent for cleaning the pot.  We will definitely need it because our water is hard and we get scaly miners deposits in our kettles. The only thing I would improve is the beeping noise when your water is done is not very loud. But that, in my opinion is a very minor thing and overall I‚Äôm very pleased!

  We've been using this electric tea kettle since October 2020 and we love it! This purchase was a replacement of a different electric kettle model that died. We drink a lot of hot and cold tea, cocoa, and coffee (we use a pour over). I spent the extra money on the variable temperature feature and I'm happy I did. It is very convenient for the different types of tea we drink. I love that it has the boil feature because I love my coffee hot, and the lower temp feature allows me to make cocoa and not burn my mouth. I like that it beeps when it comes to temperature, I like that the vessel is bigger than our old one, and the blue lights are a nice touch - it makes me feel fancy. I have had no issues with any kind of leaking or rust or calcium buildup or anything for that matter. We use filtered water and we also empty it, clean it, and let it dry out each night as is suggested in the care instructions.

  We got this after spending Christmas at a vacation rental with an electric kettle. To think I'd been living my life like a peasant heating my water up on the stovetop for so long when such options were available! We picked this one because it was still affordable but had more fancy buttons. I honestly have no clue what these buttons are for. I mean, I use black for my black tea and green for my green. But what is delicate? Are there delicate teas? Of is this so I can handwash my delicates in the kitchen sink. Probably not that since those usually say ""handwash cold"" so I use it for chamomile... I have no idea if chamomile is delicate or not though and I can't tell the difference anyways. It boils the water fast. It is pretty, affordable, and it has buttons!

You'll want to run 2 or 3 more kettles full of plain filtered water to get rid of the vinegar smell/taste.

  Even upon unboxing, you can sense that this kettle is well-made. The contact points between materials/components are solid and the glass feels sturdy. The LED lighting is a nice touch, and the fact that the kettle provides both audible and visual feedback on the completion of heating cycle is an added bonus, especially if you aren‚Äôt paying full attention, or are hard of hearing. The selection and activation buttons are not only lit when you press them, but they are tactile with a click response, so you know and feel when you‚Äôve pressed the selection successfully. The buttons themselves are rubbery and firm, which instills confidence in me that I am not going to pop one out or loosen the connections with constant use. The base fits well, and the grounded, well-shielded cord is also a confidence boost for use in the kitchen. The lid is solid and locks in place well. Mine was a little stuck when closing, but a little pull of the release mechanism and it closes/locks snuggly. I have confidence that with normal, proper use, you shouldn‚Äôt have to worry about the lid popping open.The finish on the steel of the kettle looks great aesthetically with my other appliances.I do not really have a use for a ‚ÄúKeep Warm‚Äù feature, so I cannot attest to it.I have a water dispenser in my fridge, but for adding water to the kettle with another cup the position of the the lid makes it a little awkward for pouring. Not a deal-breaker.For the price-point I absolutely recommend it. I don‚Äôt have experience with kettles at higher prices, but in my opinion of a glass, temperature-adjustable, cordless electric kettle, you won‚Äôt need to spend up to double (in some cases) for competing models.

  The first time I plugged it in, I was afraid it was defective. All of the lights on the unit's buttons kept flashing on and off and pressing one of them did nothing. I unplugged the unit, emptied the water, and let it sit for a while. I thought I was going to have to send it back, but decided to try it again because I really didn't want to deal with the return process during covoid. The second time the lights did not flash and I was able to choose a temperature. It heated perfectly and quickly. It seems to be working fine now. (I guess my prayers to the Amazon gods worked.) The unit looks classy and heats water like a dream. My only suggestion is that the beeps to tell me it's reached temperature could be a little louder because they are barely audible, but that is not extremely important because the lights go off too. I'm very pleased with the performance so far.

  We use this everyday.  It heats a lot of water very quickly.  And ours has the keep warm function for 12 hours, not just the four listed in the description.  The description says it is fast and quiet.  I don't know about that quiet part - it does say ""quieter than others on the market...""  maybe it is.  Hey, it's boiling up some water, it's going to make some noise.  It doesn't bother me - actually I'm quite content with it as the noise let's me know it's doing its job to heat up my water!  The multi-temp option is so much nicer than what was offered on a more basic model at Costco.  We're so happy with this purchase.Note; we use hard water so there's an accumulation of mineral deposits starting to form - which is rather unsightly.  So maybe you'll want to filter or purify your water to keep your kettle looking good as new.  Obviously, that is no fault of the product - just trying to be helpful.

  I had a Cuisinart electric kettle that died after about 2/3 years. I was wanting to replace it, but really wasn't loving the $100+ price tag. I finally decided to give this one a go, and it's been great! I really like the blue light indication that it's heating up or done (though I do miss the beeping of my Cuisinart). It heats up well and seems pretty reliable. Only minor nitpick is that the opening is a bit sticky (doesn't open up as smoothly as I would like), but that doesn't interfere with how it works. I'm glad I chose this electric kettle.If I'm comparing it to my Cuisinart, I would give it a 4 star (based on compared aesthetics), but just judging it for how it's performed and how it's held up after about 10 uses, I'm giving it a 5.It will at first have sort of an odd smell. At first I was concerned that the metal / plastic / something was burning, but that went away after a couple of uses. Worth the purchase!

",5.0,Leia K.,"Reviewed in the United States August 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  The kettle is compact enough, considering the two liter capacity. The glass and metal elements appear to be of good quality, and no plastic touches the water. The base is cleverly designed so the cord coils snugly underneath it with no clutter. Buttons are backlit, and don't have any labels that look like they could ever fade.Its 1200W heating element took just under 5 minutes to boil 1L of water to 212, and about 9 minutes to boil 2L.I got this for tea. It heated 1L of room temperature tap water to 175 F in 2:56 by my stopwatch and got 178 degrees F as measured with a meat thermometer. It will lose about 8 degrees when poured into the cup so this is quite precise!That's nearly a minute slower than my previous Adagio kettle for my typical use case of heating less than a liter to 175, because it turns the heating element on and off a few times as it reaches the target temperature, trading speed for precision.When the heating element is on, LEDs beneath the glass light up bright blue. It can be a bit confusing that it turns the LEDs on and off a couple times while it's closing in on the temperature. It emits 3 soft but audible and pleasant beeps when it hits the target temperature. That's the best feature because you can walk away and hear it, and you should because 3 minutes feels longer than it sounds.The kettle both beeps and lights up when put on the base, which seems a bit unnecessary to me but there must be some kind of sensory impairment that is helped by that.It ""forgets"" its settings rather quickly if taken off the base for 20 seconds or so. What that means practically is that if you want to heat it to anything but boiling and keep it warm, that's 3 button presses each time: temperature, keep warm, and start. Would be nice if it could remember my last temperature and keep-warm settings, but that's not a common feature at this price point.If set to keep warm, it does so by briefly turning on the heating element occasionally to keep near the set temperature. I don't recommend that to keep the water boiling, but it's good for tea temperatures and can be a handy feature if you re-use tea leaves.The latch on top can be an annoyance: you can press it to open the kettle to fill, but you also need to press it when closing the kettle or else the little removable filter in the lid gets caught on the lip of the glass.Overall this is a great kettle, but some usability issues around how many button-presses it takes to use it, the top latch, and the lower-power heating element makes it not quite right for me.Edit: after trying other kettles and considering, I believe 5 stars is the only fair rating for this kettle. It does what it's supposed to, looks and functions great, and the service is top-notch. They include a warranty and returns on Amazon are easy so there's no reason not to try it. Disclosure: the company DID offer a small gift for writing a review, but they had NO input or comment into the content or rating of my review, honest.

  I waited to review till I tested this out.  For the money I am very pleased.  There are not many electric kettles that have temperature control and tell what its for.  Many just have temp but not labeled what tea/ coffee type it‚Äôs for, I find this very helpful. I would like it to brew faster, but the time seems to be standard compared to others. The heat output seems to run a few degrees under, but produces good green, herbal, and black teas as well as coffee. Warming feature is a combination of three buttons but no brainer once you read manual. For the safety feature it turns itself off if the kettle is s empty so definitely happy with that.  For the price I think it has all the features of more expensive brands.

    Perfect kettle for brewing different teas
  
",5.0,Sara,"Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  I love tea, and have a huge collection of different types--from herbals to greens to blacks and everything in between. If you know tea, you know that the water temperature at which you brew the tea makes a big difference in the flavor profile of the tea, and this kettle is perfect for that. It's pretty quick to heat up to any temperature, and I love that it's clear glass. It looks so sleek and nice on my countertop! The auto shut-off is great for safety, but I also like that I can choose to keep the water at a certain temperature so that I can have a second cup later in the morning. Would highly recommend this kettle for a sharp-looking, mid-range, temperature-controlled tea kettle!

",5.0,N. Beach,"Reviewed in the United States October 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased this for my wife who is an avid home brew ice team maker. It is safe to say we use this kettle everyday. The heat settings allow us to adjust temp for not scalding green tea leaves. I also use the kettle for instant oatmeal. I personally like the alarm that lets me know when water is at temp but not so loudly that the kettle wakes up the entire house when I get up early. The large size is just right for a full pitcher of ice, but not so large that it takes up too much counter space. The kettle heats fast so you are not left standing there waiting. The one miss, I with this was integrated with Alexa so I could schedule heating in the AM when my phone detects when I get up, know and alert me when it reaches temp if I leave the room, and not heat up when there is no water. That would be AWESOME!!!

    Keep warm and settings for green tea...high capacity -- it's all good
  
",5.0,EricP,"Reviewed in the United States November 20, 2019","









  
  
    
  What's good about it?  High capacity.  Keep warm feature.  Clear glass - not tinted or mirrored so cleaning when needed will probably be easier.  I've switched to green and matcha tea -- the lower temperature controls are helpful for a perfect brew.Our previous electric kettle inconveniently died after only 18 months -- six months after the manufacturer's warranty ended.  This kettle has a 36-month warranty, so we are happy with the confidence that HadinEEon has in its product longevity.  Time will tell of course.  Read the instructions on temperature settings less than 212 degrees -- it's a two-step process: Select Temp then Start.  But if you just want to boil water, press Start and you're good to go.What's bad about it?  There is nothing bad about this kettle I have noticed.  However, as a side note, I'd point out that with any electric kettle, it takes longer to heat more water rather than less.  Since this kettle has a higher capacity of 2.0 liters(!) so fill only with the water level you really need; This minimizes the waiting time and saves electricity.

    Expensive, but worth it
  
",5.0,Amy,"Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2021","









  
  
    
  I didn't want to spend close to $60 for this kettle but once it got here and even more so after using it for a few months, I'm glad I did. I had to send back a cheaper version I tried before because it was impractical. This one is great. When making green tea I set the temp to 160 rather than waiting for the water to cool after the previous kettle turned off. It boils water more quickly than the stovetop. Oh and it has a keep warm function. Shouldn't be a surprise at that price but I had no idea how much I would love that function. The cord is flexible and long enough whereas the previous kettle had a short, extremely thick, unbendable cord. After about 6 weeks of daily, continuous use there was some mineral settlement on the bottom and sides. I boiled about 1/3 full of white vinegar and let it sit for 24 hours then boiled several times a full pot of water to get rid of the taste and it was just as new. Highly recommended.

  This is a great tea kettle. I wish the temperature options were not quite so ""spread out"" - but it works well enough. The calibration is not dead on - but again, it's within a few degrees. That being said, I live at 7,000 feet elevation - so water boils at a lower temperature then sea level. The thermostat and temp setting may work better at sea level for this and any similar kettle. When I first received it, I inadvertently threw away the instructions before I'd had a chance to read them and was not sure how the ""keep warm"" setting worked. I emailed the company after tracking down the product right away and got a very quick response the the manual digitally sent to me. Overall, I would recommend this product and the company who manufactures it.

  We‚Äôve only had it a short while but so far it is working well.  It has buttons with pre-determined temperatures, and a guide of different temperatures for different teas in the manual.  We are getting more into teas and are realizing we have probably been using the wrong T for many of them with a basic kettle.  You can‚Äôt set your own T, you have to use one of the pre-programmed ones.  You select the T you want and then press start.  A blue light goes on when the water is heating up, a beep tells you when it‚Äôs done.  You can hold the water at temperature when it‚Äôs done but we haven‚Äôt tried that feature yet.  It doesn‚Äôt take up a lot of room on the counter.  Overall we are happy with it.

",5.0,Maddie,"Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  We have gone through 4 other teapots before this one. An older workhorse than just boiled water and held up for 4  years. And then we went through 3 different teapots that all had lots of bells and whistles. Infusers, temperature controls in 5-10 degree increments, warmers, etc. Those all broke. One teapot gave us a replacement and it broke again. They got dirty and we had to clean them all the time because of the tea being steeped in them, which we think contributed to their rapid decline. They were also not very expensive, around $40-$50 for all of those features. We came to the conclusion that you get what you pay for, and all those features might be too much in a single teapot. Infusing tea in the kettle itself might be too hard on the sensor or the components. So we went with this teapot. It had lots of reviews, the core features we needed, it was big enough for what we do. It had all the temperature controls we wanted for the different types of teas we drink and other things that we need it for. And it has a warmer feature that we use occasionally. It really is a solid tea pot and has held up so far without any problems. We also haven't noticed any gross things  building up inside it so far like the last ones because all that happens is that we boil filtered water (or get water hot) every day.If it fails in the future, I'll come back and update this review.

    Lots of better functions than a regular kettle, temperature not accurate
  
",4.0,Carol L,"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2021","









  
  
    
  Almost everything about this kettle is wonderful. The only downside is we tested the kettle out for temperature accuracy- it was consistently below the temperature it was set to. We put the hot water in a hot mug and it would be anywhere between 20-5 degrees lower than it was supposed to be. I did refill the hot kettle with cold water to test that out too. Everything else is great. It beeps when the water is done, does have varying temperature controls, has a fun blue light, and I would absolutely buy it again (although this is day 1 of using it).  The only thing I would want is an electronic temperature reader or custom set. But that seems picky.

  I have been using variable temp electric tea kettles since my very first Cuisinart, probably 35 years ago. I drink different types of tea, and I use a French press for coffee, so a variable temp kettle is a basic kitchen requirement. My last one just gave up the ghost after 12 years, and I bought this one. WOW!!! I think every other kettle I have had is, at most, 1.7 liter. This one is a fat 2.0 liters, and I could not be happier. My borosilicate glass tea pot holds a bit over 1.7 liters, so I have always had to slightly over-fill my kettle to get a full teapot. Not anymore!  And like some kind of unexpected bonus, this unit is totally gorgeous, and ""goes"" with my blue-lighted kitchen :-). Bravo!!Update: Love it even more! ;-)

  I gave this 5 stars because of the features it has. It's guiet, has multiple tea and french press hot water settings. What I really think stands out is it's warming features, I don't have to reheat the water, you can have it warmed for 12 hours. I also like the cup markings though depending on your cup size you may have to increase the water slightly. And it has an alarm so when it's ready if you're doing something else it's a great little reminder your water is ready. The one thing that could be improved, though minor is the top, there is a button for your finger on the top to open it and the top itself is small. This is very minor compared to all of the pluses so I didn't take a point off for it. The blue lights are a visual that just looks cool.

    Best Electric Kettle Ever
  
",5.0,Elizabeth and Rich,"Reviewed in the United States December 14, 2019","









  
  
    
  We've owned many electric kettles over the years and this is our all-time favorite. We've had kettles that kept the water warm (or attempted to) and others that had a temperature control. But this one has both those features and much more. The water remains hot for hours. It's easy to operate. Other kettles have a general temperature setting by degrees, not by use (black tea vs. green tea for example). Every day we use it for green tea and either French press or black tea. Having all these settings is wonderful. And it's lovely to look at--the blue light as it's heating is a very nice feature as well. Highly recommend this kettle!

  The build quality was good and the heat output was also nothing to complain about. Water heated up quickly and switched off at the preset temperature.However, I had two issues - the temperature seemed to be off by about 10F (as checked with a calibrated contact thermometer). Also the volume markings on the glass are inaccurate by a large margin. The .5 liter marking was actually only 300ml.So its perfectly ok for general purpose heating but if you want precise control over volume and temperature then its not that great.

",4.0,Sherri McFarland,"Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2019","









  
  
    
  The kettle is great and much as expected. However, one complaint we have is that the kettle will not maintain a boil after it senses it has reached a boil. If you want to fill your tea pot with boiling water, then you must be ready with the pot and bags as soon as the kettle reaches boil. Pushing the ""boil"" button will not keep the kettle actively heating for boil. This was disappointing as my previous kettle (different brand but same idea with the multiple temperatures) could do this. My husband now adds COLD water to the boiled water to trick the kettle into heating up again so that he can have a second attempt at being ready EXACTLY at the boil.

  I purchased this product to make Ice Tea.  The product arrived promptly and was well packaged. Easy to follow instructions were included. Its very easy to use and I like that it has different settings on the handle to make different types of teas.(black, green, oolong, variable.) The water heats up very fast and has all the warming and/or shut off features you would expect in a quality product. The design of the pitcher is nice and has blue lights that come on when its heating the water. Once the water is heated I pour it into a glass pitcher (Pykal) made to handle boiling water to steep and store the tea. I used to haul out a heavy pot and store the tea in a Rubbermade pitcher. The tea is much brighter and tastes dramatically better then my old method. I haven't tried the white or oolong tea yet, but the black tea makes an excellent pot of tea. I wasn't expecting it to be this noticeable. The lid seems to be of good quality and the markings to note how low/high to fill the kettle are clear and easy to read. The cord is well designed and fits nicely under the power base. Other nice things include a heat resistant handle, the variable temperature control and the lid has a filter for water build up. It is also easy to clean. I highly recommend this kettle.

It also has handy features regarding keeping the pot warm for those second and third cups!I picked it up on sale, but it is still a good value for the price. Recommended!

    Soft beep when ready

  Overall, this kettle works well.  I like the ""keep warm"" feature that allows for the water to stay at the temperature you picked for a while so that if you or someone else wants another cup of tea or hot chocolate you don't have to wait for the water to heat up again.  I will say however that you really need to be aware and listen for the ""beep"" that lets you know when the water meets the temperature you selected because it is a very soft beep.  The one other feature that this kettle is lacking that I had on a different one I had was the ability to see the temperature digitally as it heated.

  I started drinking tea more as of late, but from researching I found out that you can actually burn tea and that is what can make it taste bitter! I've always just used a kettle on the stove, until now. I began using this electric kettle the day it arrived. The settings are easy and the buttons are even labeled for the type of tea or coffee you are making. It saves me a lot of time in the morning because I don't have to wait for that annoying whistle (and wake everyone else up in the process). Now, I can just set the temperature, start it, and tell it to keep warm while I am getting ready. It is so easy to use and worth every penny! My partner loves it too because it has a french press setting. If you are a tea lover like me, you'll love this kettle.

    Very good electric Kettle
  
",4.0,Pilar,"Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2021","









  
  
    
  We purchase this about 3+ months ago. It has performed very well for what we were looking for. I like the glass kettle, I can see what's inside, and the blue light feature also tells you that your water is boiling/ready. The only con here is that the glass gets hot, good for an adult household, you have to be careful if you have kids or pets around.The head out put works fine, however, you do need two hands to operate it, I have used electric kettles where you can do this with one hand only. It is not a nuisance, and maybe someone with bigger hands than mine can hold the pot handle and operate the lever with one hand.We also like the temperature feature, very convenient for making tea or geting the water to a french press temperature. The capacity is good enough, we usually fill it half way.

  It's a very good looking Electric Kettle and easy to use. Ideal for making tea, or just for hot water.It's just a little taller than the water faucet on my refrigerator, so every time I need to use another container to take water then add to the kettle.Another issue is that after 2-3 days use, I found there are 30%-40% of the bottom of the kettle showing small dark spots, and those spots cannot be easily cleaned by dish liquid detergent nor vinegar with hours soaking. Previously I thought it might be a quality issue, but the last time I tried to use vinegar to soaking overnight, and those dark spots are all gone~! Yeah, great, like new.Therefore, especially functional speaking, I like this kettle!

    Good first impression
  
",5.0,notmyrealname,"Reviewed in the United States September 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  Disclaimer: I'm submitting a review upon receipt of this item as part of an incentivized product registration process. So, I'm limited to describing first impressions and one-time use. Still, so far, so good. The kettle is replacing a model at a lower price point that was stainless steel and without the variable temp option, which lasted us for a little less than four years. (It began having issues staying closed with the spring-loaded lid mechanism catch, and then with maintaining proper contact with the power supply, which it eventually stopped doing.) In comparison, this one is larger capacity (2.0 liters as opposed to 1.7), slightly less wattage (1200W vs. 1500W), and so far has shown itself to be quieter and still quick to heat/boil. I like the glass carafe, and the varied temp control is an added feature I look forward to utilizing as someone who enjoys tea culture when I have time. (Usually I don't, but I have some aging Pu-erh cakes around and I'm now a little more tempted to get some green or white teas, for example, knowing that I can do a better job of brewing and enjoying them before they sit too long in my cabinets.)In comparison to my old one, I'd say this kettle is quite ""substantial."" I think this is positive insofar as it feels like it is metal and glass and not so much plastic. On the other hand, one other reviewer commented on it being heavy which could potentially create some difficulties if you're arthritic, for example. (I don't know if others like this on the market are any different or not.) I haven't yet tried to explore settings and features... hopeful that it's possible to turn off and on things like the ""keep warm"" function, which is generally welcome. I, too, like the blue light. :-)All in all it looks solid and I'm hopeful I will get several good years from it. Naturally, time will tell. The 3-year warranty would seem like decent insurance should issues arise. Best of luck in your search!

  I love this Electric Kettle! It so pretty and has blue LED lights that come on when it's heating water to 6 different temperature settings.  It has cup/liter measurements, 2 4 6 8 cups, on the side so you can heat and pour when adding to a recipe.  It beeps 3 times when your water temperature has been reached and automatically shuts off.  The clear glass design also looks less cluttered when sitting on the counter. I also really like that there isn't an excessive amount of steam coming from the top when the water comes to a boil. I've used a Chef's Choice stainless electric kettle for years and it produced so much steam that I had to move it out to the edge of the counter to prevent excessive steam on cabinet above my kettle. This kettle: boils, beeps and shuts off!

  Its a good product as long as you can put up with innitial four five water boiling with a very strong plastic taste in water...I was at the verge of returning it when I realized the smell was disappearing gradually. Also, it would be more convenient if lid opening could be adjusted at top of handle instead of top of lid. The base material could do with a bit of upgrading, as it feels to be inconsistent with rich looking fascade of the product.Otherwise its a convenient product with quick boiling features for varying temperatures.

  This kettle has worked spectacularly for us! I love the multiple temperature options the accommodate the various teas in our cabinets. I also use it to keep water at a boil when I'm doing a massive meal prep - it opens up a burner on the stove that doesn't need to be dedicated to boiling water, and water's always ready at boil whenever I need to use it for a recipe.The only issue we've encountered so far is the ""floating shiny specks"" in the water that others have commented on, as well. It turned out that we just needed to boil 1 cup of vinegar with 1 cup of water in the kettle whenever this happens - floating specks and calcification on the bottom metal portion of the kettle disappear! We've had to deal with this twice in the 6 months we've had the kettle so expect to clean it every 3 months or so.

  First of all I'd like to draw the line between ""electric kettle"" and ""temperature control electric kettle"", especially if you are big fan of tea. Presets for White, Green, Oolong and Black make every tea session as simple as it could be.""Keep warm"" feature is also handy to keep selected temperature for 12 hrs.Speaking of the product itself and build quality - it's slick, convenient and has a magnificent blue illumination while it heats. Due to initial light weight it's also on safer side when operated by people who does not have strong hands to hold 2 liters of boiling water with one hand - at least my 10 yo kid managed to do it safe.The cup is made of borosilicate glass, which is known for its very low thermal expansion coefficients. It also does pretty good job to protect you from burns when you would accidentally touch the kettle full of boiling water.As for things that ""could be better"" - when on full 2 liter volume, it actually takes time to boil it up. This is a kind of  expected for 1200W (and going with more power is actually tricky on 110V outlets). But once boiled - it can hold a temperature.

The controls allow to adjust the water temperature from 160 to 212 degrees Fahrenheit.Beeps when it‚Äôs ready, and will hold the temperature for a very long amount time which is really good which inturn saves lot of power ,as an added benefit the handle stays cool, and the spout doesn‚Äôt dribble when pouring.To have the perfect taste of tea or coffee, the kettle has temperature settings for required options of tea or coffee to select accordingly.The removable mesh filter is also an appreciable feature to clean any scale deposits.To conclude I really like this and it is worth purchasing .

    Good, cheaper substitue to the Cuisinart variant
  
",5.0,Jeffrey W Cline,"Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  After many years of use, my Cuisinart 1.7L variable temp electric kettle started leaking at the point where the handle joined to the water chamber. Until then I had been extremely satisfied with the product and initially thought to replace it with the same model. Then I saw this product for roughly half the price, and it seemed it could do pretty much everything the Cuisinart could. I decided to give it a shot and I am glad I did.The good: From my perspective, the product does technically do everything the Cuisinart did. I have been using for a few months now and I am satisfied, especially given the lower price tag.The bad: This is subjective, and these qualities may be more desirable compared to the Cuisinart, based on your own preferences. First, if you choose a temp that is less than boiling, I would guess this product takes slightly longer to heat the water than the Cuisinart. This is because once it gets close to temperature, the heating element begins to kick on and off to heat the water more gradually. The idea must be to avoid over-heating the water, but I have no way to test heating accuracy compared to the Cuisinart. I personally don't find this feature annoying, but my wife does - so you may want to keep it in mind. Second, the beeper that lets you know your water is up to temperature is much quieter than the Cuisinart. Again, this could be good or bad depending on your preferences. I tend to dislike this, as if I leave the kitchen I usually cannot hear the beeper go off.Overall, despite my minor gripes, I think the functionality your get for the cost is better than the Cuisinart, and would recommend.

  This kettle is the answer to make consistently good cups of tea.  I've spent enough time in SE Asia to cultivate a taste for a variety of teas.  Many of them such as green teas brew best at lower hot temperatures.  In the past, I've brought the water kettle to a full boil then make my best guess as to how long to set it aside before I poured it onto the tea.This is no longer necessary as I press the appropriate button according to the type of tea I'm brewing.  I especially like the temperature hold feature.  This is very helpful in the event I get sidetracked and not able to immediately brew the tea.  I highly recommend this clever product.

",5.0,Karol,"Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've been using electric kettles for over a decade as I drink copious amounts of tea requiring various temperatures. I usually stuck with the big name brands like Cuisinart, but they were very expensive and still ended up breaking after only a 2 years sometimes. I also usually went for Stainless Steel Kettles since I was always nervous around glass, but the review on this one were solid and it and the brand really looked like quality. So I decided to give it a try.Well, I am incredibly pleased! After several months, its become one of my favorite. It looks elegant, feels sturdy, and is also fairly quiet. The beeps are all a nice soft low volume (certain previous ones I had you could hear through the whole house and were incessant). The temperature are accurate and the controls/buttons also feel solid (some other models felt more flimsy or would struggle to make contact over time).I actually prefer the glass now because of how easy it is to see how much water is in there and whether I need to clean it. And on that note the top latch is nice and simple, no sharp metal edges or complex combination, just a solid top that connects sturdily with the glass, makes it easy to clean and fill. I was concerned about the blue lighting at night being too bright as my living room and tv is nearby, but it's not obnoxious at all and is gives the kitchen a modern feel on top of the pleasant design.Other models out there may be more powerful, but all that's going to do is shave 30 seconds off your cold-to-boil time and often times more powerful models would trip my breakers (I tend to have a lot of devices throughout the house, kitchen included, but never an obnoxious amount). This one has never caused such an issue so I actually prefer its power level as each apartment has its own electrical nuances that may make them sensitive or just be wired with undesirable layouts, but I don't have to worry about it with this one which is another unexpected plus.You will be pleased with this kettle :)

    Comparison to AICOOK
  
",5.0,Jillyn W.,"Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  I ordered this teakettle and I enjoyed it but I was really missing a good way to brew loose leaf. I understand this one has a mesh strainer on the spout but pieces of loose tea would make it through every time without fail. I really enjoyed the LED blue light while it was brewing that changed when it reached temperature and how quick  easy it was to set temperature with all of the settings. Ultimately I found an AICOOK tea kettle that was meant to brew loose leaf. When I got it I did a test and started them both to brew 7 cups of water to 212. The AICOOK made it to temperature almost an entire minute before this kettle did. I also did not enjoy that the lid did not come completely off since I use filtered  water from my refrigerator door and it was difficult to fill with a lid that does not remove completely. When comparing the two, I also realized that the shape of the spout from where the water pours on this kettle sometimes made the water splash more so than the AICOOK one. I did enjoy how easy this one was to set the temperature quickly and easily and the auto warming function (AICOOK does also have the auto warming function but it will not work with the 212 degree setting because keeping temperature at 212 would result in constant boiling water that would evaporate quickly).Ultimately the AICOOK kettle was what I decided to keep but this was a nice kettle that had some good features as well. I have updated my review to a 5 star review despite returning this kettle because of the company's customer service. I feel confident that if you have any issue with this product, they will be willing to help solve it. I can not speak for AICOOKs customer service. I've attempted to reach out to them regarding the auto-warming function at temperature of 212 but I did not get any response. I found my answer by doing some research on my own. I do not feel confident that if I have any issues with my AICOOK kettle that company would be willing to fix them.

  This is the 4th different kettle we've bought on Amazon over the past 8 years and it seems to be the best one yet:- It has a clean look and can be kept clean by draining all excess water after each use- It comes with a small pouch of citric acid, which can be used once there is a calcium buildup at the bottom. Just add a teaspoon of citric acid with some water and bring to a boil. Drain and rinse. Looks like new.- The temperature settings seem accurate and the warming function works very wellI strongly suggest to use filtered water and only as much as you need each time. Then drain and set aside with the lid open.

The 2,000+ very positive  Amazon  reviews. Even less positive reviews were satisfied with customer service.#2. The kettle has 6 heat settings taking the guesswork out of brewing the perfect cup of coffee or tea.#3. I wanted a glass kettle for easy cleaning. And I'm a pot watcher.#4. It comes with a 2 year warranty for full refund or replacement,  but the enclosed paperwork says you can register the product and become a VIP customer and the warranty extends to 3 years.After the kettle arrived (after just 2 days!)  I found more reasons to be pleased. The kettle takes up much less precious counterspace. It is visually very attractive, and the blue light is not only pleasing, but indicates that the heater is working. The button controls are clear and convenient and beep nicely when pressed. And most importantly, it does what it is supposed to do- heat water - well and quickly.The only negatives I can think of (and I'm really reaching here) are that the beeps are a little quiet, and and the kettle feels a little heavy, but that's probably the fault of the water, not the pot.I am very pleased with this product.

  This is my first temp. controlled kettle. I had always wanted one, but they were always too expensive compared to the regular model. Enter the HadinEEonTemperature Electric Kettle. I absolutely love it. Has completely changed the way I make herb teas and french press coffee. If you ever wondered if the temperature of the water really makes a difference, I have two words for you: It does! If you are on the fence, give it a try. You will love it too. One design request: When I close the lid (at least on my kettle), it takes an extra effort to click it down one more time to make sure the lid is snuggly fitted down. If I fail to do this second click, the lid stays elevate a 1/4 inch or so, and the water pours out too wide. If you are too close to the cup, you risk spiling a bit on the counter from the wide pour, and at worst scalding yourself. It took me having a 'learning' experience' once or twice to now be firmly in the habit of double-checking, but I bet with a little engineering, they could solve this minor issue and make this wonderful kettle even more wonderful.

  Not only is this electric kettle attractive out on my counter, but the temp control is awesome. We have an electric kettle at my office that I love using however if I get busy and cant monitor it, it shuts itself off after boiling so that when I have a moment to make my tea or coffee, I have to start it again. Sooo, when deciding I'd like one of these babies at home I looked for one that had a ""keep warm"" feature. Not only does this little guy have that, but also a few different temp settings of which the ""Pressed Coffee"" is my fav. Who knew? Being new to the pressed coffee game, I had no idea its not best to just pour boiling water into the press. There is also a Tea setting. Its also super fast and quiet until ready, then you get the beep. Buy one and love yourself for it!

  I have been using this kettle for four months and am very satisfied with it. I love the fact that you can set specific temperatures for different types of beverages. I drink green tea and yerba mate daily, and these require different temperatures for best results. With this kettle, it is a breeze to brew my favorite beverages. It does take a longer time than I was used to for the water to boil (previously I used an electric kettle without temp control). The words on the temperature control buttons also are coming off from being pressed so often. But when everything is taken into account, I am still a happy camper. The material is sturdy. I love the glass body and being able to see the water come to a boil :-)

  ¬†I love this kettle! It holds a good amount of water, is sleek and attractive, and is just mesmerizing to watch!I love the fact it has so many great settings for my different teas, but my favorite feature is the ""keep warm"" function! My husband gets up a little earlier than I do in the morning, so he starts the kettle for me and uses the keep warm function so I'm guaranteed a perfect temperature water whenever I'm ready.8 cups boils in about 10 minutes which is way faster than my last kettle, but if you use less water, it comes to temperature faster.It is so easy to clean, and I've gotten many compliments on it. It also beeps when it's come to the selected temperature. Nothing loud or shrill, just two little beeps to alert you to its readiness.I would gladly buy this again!

  All electric kettles are not the same.  The HadinEEon variable temp 2.0L kettle is now the most used appliance in our kitchen.  From morning French Roast coffee and instant hash browns, to afternoon tea and sauce creations for dinner, we find we are using the kettle three or four times a day.  The selectable temperature is not a gimmick, it really does make better tasting tea and coffee when you have the option to reach lower temperature water than only boiling.  And the unit is blazingly fast, taking less than 1/2 the time to boil water than the stove top, and using less energy to boot. Love this kettle!

  After scalding one too many cups of my more delicate green teas, I wanted something that had actual temperature control, as opposed to me timing my kettle and removing it from the heating base and hoping that it was a better temperature.I am still surprised at how few kettles offer this feature, but this one does, and short of having tested it with a thermometer, seems to work well. The materials feel like a good quality, and the glass pitcher avoids the gross issue of limescale that I had previous kettle.All around, an upgrade from your typical, stainless steel kettle, and for the same price (if not better).

  I purchased this item because we are big fans of keeping a pot of water hot all day for tea. The 'keep warm' function shuts itself off when the kettle is removed from the base, though the directions say it is supposed to remain functional if the kettle is put back on the base within 20 seconds.Also going with a 1500w rather than 1200w, it makes a big difference in the time it takes to bring the water to boil.Try again.

  You would think that everyone owns a kettle, but as a Brit living in the USA, I have found this is not true. Everyone should own a kettle, and it should be this one - a HadinEEon Variable Temperature Electric Kettle.Why?, Kettles only boil water, so what's the big deal?This Kettle has a couple of things going for it that your current saucepan (if you live in the USA) does not do. It is fast and super convenient, has 6 different temperature controls (and for a Tea drinking Brit, this is a big deal and it is extremely accurate too. If you happen to be in search for a Kettle replacement, then I can again only highly recommend this Kettle.What makes this Kettle stand out to me, are the following few points.1. The water capacity is 2.0liters, when most other Kettles only hold 1.5liters.2. It has temperature control (and for a Tea drinking Brit, this actually matters - A LOT)3. It is super fast in boiling 2.0 liters (I did not time it, but I did a compare against my older Kettle, and 2.0 liters boiled faster than the 1.5 liter Kettle (go figure)4. It is extremely good looking, and many of my US friends (who do not own a Kettle( have commented on how neat looking it is - as it is clear and illuminates with a blue light - really cool5. It is well built and feels like a solid piece of kit.So, this Kettle, even though it just boils water, is a very well put together Kettle, with some nice features, and is great looking too.

  I have had this electric  kettle for over two months now.  I bought it to replace another brand  kettle that I used for several years.  The quality on this one seems much better and it is very attractive.  I use it several times a day for making tea, coffee, and broth.  i like how it lights up at the bottom when it is being heated, which is not only practical but it makes it a fun experience to use. The diameter of the lid which is larger than the last one I had, makes it easier to use when I am refilling it. There is a keep warm function as well as buttons that are labeled with both the temperature and type of tea brewed at that temperature.  I researched various kettles and this one had all the features I wanted at a good price. I honestly can not think of any negatives to this product and I highly recommend it.

  We originally found this kettle while looking for a larger capacity kettle to go with our new 1.5L french press, and this one turned out to be the best electric kettle I have owned so far!Pros:- The capacity is as stated, up to 2.0L or as little as 0.5L if you just need a cup of tea.- The temperature controls are very accurate. There are settings for 160, 170, 180, 190, 200, and 212 degrees (F). It gets to 160-180 pretty fast, but 190 and 200 can take longer than just full boil, but that is because it flips the heat on and off a few times to make sure that it hits exactly the temperature specified instead of running +5-8 degrees like some other kettles I have owned.- It looks really nice.- I haven't had to clean it yet, but the filter is removable and there aren't any hidden areas for water to sit and form buildup (at least anywhere I have seen).- It has a really nice (and accurate) keep at temp setting!Cons:- One minor complaint - I would love it if the beep to let you know it's finished was a bit louder!  But don't let that stop you from getting this wonderful kettle!

  This HadinEEon Electric Kettle replaced (another manufactures kettle) that lasted ~2 years. We use this kettle 2-3 times a day, it boils fast (1200W worth of power) The large capacity was another feature that we were looking for in a kettle and this had it. Never considered the feature ""KEEP WARM"" but this allows the kettle to hold the water at the required temperature, this is great if you are cooking and need hot water during the cooking steps, but don't want to wait/have time for the kettle to re-boil;, just press ""KEEP WARM"" and the kettle will do that for you. The last 3-4 kettles all have the blue LED feature (when on) this is a feature and looks 'cool' at night, day time it is on too, but in the evening/night this looks the best. As we seem to 'go-through' kettles, the 3-year warranty (hopefully never have to use it!) was another reason why we purchased this kettle. Being using it for >3 months and are still 100% happy with the purchase.

About just tat expensive than the average price.- I need to actually test this, but as long as the glass is strong enough, this is far the best design for the least risk for collision (no metal nuts or anything exposed) inside and mold problem (no gap between parts inside that can't be cleaned with hands).- All the possible temperature settings with warm function.- The base is covered silver metal on the side, so it blends in with whole design.  Most of the others just plain black.- Boiling fast enough.- 2L size is adequate for all-day tea drinking.- blue light comes on and it's not too bright or cheezy, so I like it.- coupons and gifts are always welcome.I don't have any cons, because I just received it.  I will come back and update my review when it doesn't hold my expectation.  So far, it's perfect.

  I looked around Amazon for electric kettles with temperature buttons, and when I saw the visual design of this one along with the affordable price, I knew I had to try it. The glowing reviews are warranted: I cannot really find a single fault with this product other than that the beeping sound it makes when the water is at the correct temperature is a little quiet. Quiet enough that you wouldn't be able to hear it in another room or if something else is making a constant noise in the kitchen. But if you just hit the keep warm button when you start it, this is less of a concern. Unless the kettle is completely full, boiling takes less than 5 minutes, and the less water you have the faster it will reach the desired temperature. This is honestly a great product that I wish I had had in my life earlier. I have finally started to drink several cups of black/green tea throughout the day and a couple of cups of herbal tea at night, and I drink this much every day. I just fill it up at night when it starts to get low and it's ready to make tea the next morning. I also use this for those ramen packages where you lift the lid halfway and pour boiling water in and close the lid for 3 minutes. Using boiled water from a microwave is very dangerous when making those sorts of ramens (like Cup Noodles), but this product makes it completely safe. I first learned about these when I was in Japan and it seemed like such a no-brainer product that I had to get one when I got back. I also use it to help boil additional water faster for when I'm boiling something in a pot on the stove. No complaints here!

  So far it's worked like a champ. We use ours daily and I wanted something that holds more water than the usual 4-6 cup kettles. It's about as loud while boiling as any kettle is, certainly quieter than our previous one. I love the metal strainer/filter over the spout (we have hard water and it keeps the flakes out of my tea). Easy to clean; just pour some vinegar and water in and boil. That descales everything without any scrubbing. I've never had a kettle with temperature buttons before but it's so convenient not to have to temp the water for different kinds of teas before brewing. I also LOVE the keep warm function. I turn it on while getting ready in the evenings and don't have to worry about reheating it if I forget or take too long. Definitely would recommend it! It's worth the price!

  So far, I have only used this kettle 5 times plus testing, which is not exactly a great example of its reliability, and I will revise this review after I have used this kettle for longer periods of time,  like 1-month, 3-months, and 6-months. Three major sections jump out at me: The parts I really love, the parts I think they could improve, and the parts that are neutral.The Pros:+ The glass and light combination makes the kettle look mesmerizing when in use, doubled by the trend for the water to develop currents that draw and hold the eye.+ The capacity is quite large, and is very useful for making Southern Sweet Tea by the gallon, or making stock from bouillon to put into soups or stews.+ The temperature buttons, which are quite accurate as I tested with an external thermometer, make brewing different types of tea a breeze (I'm especially a fan of green teas and french press coffee, so this is wonderful!)The Cons- The handle is quite large and not very ergonomic. I have larger hands as tall male college student, and I find the handle section to be very thick and hard to grasp firmly- Its very heavy, even without water in it. This isn't a deal-breaker for me, as I don't struggle with lifting or moving heavy objects, but my mother or grandmother would probably struggle quite a bit with it. With  decent quantity of water, the problem is exacerbated.Overall, this kettle stacks up well against the market. That says, I am curious as to how it will last over time, and I was glad to see that HadinEEon includes a 3-year manufacturers' warranty.Disclaimer: the main reason I am writing this review now instead of using the product for a month first, as is my norm, is due to the reward for an honest review that included randomly with some orders. I will update this review as needed as I test the long-term reliability and features of this product, as well as customer service if I need to use my warranty.

  I bought this to replace a plastic electric kettle which didn't have variable temperature control. It takes about 10 minutes to heat a full kettle of water, but for a cup or two it is much quicker. There is a soft beep once it's done boiling, which I like because I tend to set the kettle and walk off to do something, so it reminds me that I was in the middle of making tea. The lid has a latch, which opens easily, and it opens wide for easy cleaning. And the blue light is a nice feature. Overall, very satisfied with this kettle.

It boils water quickly (and I really appreciate the stay warm feature). It takes a bit more time to do the other temperatures just because it has to turn on/off a few times in order to reach the proper temperature but I would imagine that would be the same among all appliances like this & it's worth the wait in my opinion.All-in-all I am very pleased with my purchase & I have used it every day (sometimes multiple times a day) since I purchased at the end of July and still looks and feels brand new.

I loved the way it decided the water temperature and keep it at a constant temperature that you selected, starting up to a boil, stops, heats a little bit more, then finally beeps to let you know it is ready. A little different from a normal kettle that will go full blast to the peak of boiling and then just shut off.This was the most shocking part of the kettle. My coffee and tea tasted different and came out differently. I know this is a weird thing to say, but having the temperature specifically set to what you want actually makes a difference in the taste. It does burn the coffee nor tea leaves so the water temp perfectly meshes with the product you are making. I was so shocked, and so hyped, I made about 20 cups that day. Keeping the water warm is a great feature as well for a heavy drinker like me.Honestly, if I knew this existed and knew what I was getting out of it, I would have gotten it earlier. It was a pleasantly shocking and now I can say that for the price, it is definitely worth it.  You got a fan!

    Defective Key Feature:  No Beeping When Water is Ready
  
",1.0,Gloria,"Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  First time I've gotten stuck with a defective product:  I plug it in, go about my business, and wait and wait -- NO BEEPING!  so each time (at least 2x a day), I have to try to figure out how long the blue lights at the bottom have been off and whether I need to start all over.  I contacted Amazon Prime's ""product support chat"" who could not tell me how to turn on the beep -- no fix offered, just a platry $12 for the beep not working.  It would cost me that much in packaging, gas and time. hassle etc. to return it.  Products should be quality-checked for this type of discoverable defect before offering up for sale, and seller AND Amazon Prime should have been highly concerned that a customer rec'd a defective product.  The beeping is THE central feature since we'd like to know when the water is ready unless you want to just STAND there the whole time -- then you may as well just put water in a pot and wait and watch it boil.

  Just received this today and boiled 2 kettles almost full.  Very fast for a 1,200W kettle.  The quality seems very good and the larger size is nice.  The buttons are easy to press and I like the way the lid latches.  I had purchased another big name brand (Cuisinart) and the lid wouldn't stay shut when pouring or anything else for that matter.  It even opened once while heating water.  I returned it to the store where I purchased it and ordered this one from Amazon based on the great reviews.  So far, I am very pleased with my purchase.

What I want is a temperature control function for heating up the water and a keep warm function that keeps the water at the set temperature for a few hours. Also, I prefer the pot made entirely of either glass or stainless steel, without the water touching any plastic parts. However, most stainless steel pot have a plastic window for viewing the water level.This teapot has all the features I want, is of obviously high quantity materials, Ang heats up fast to exact temperature.

  Believe it or not, decreasing the amount of sugar my family consumes guided this purchase of a HadinEEon Temperature Variable Electric Kettle. When we eliminated sugar and artificial sweeteners from our tea, we noticed a bitter taste. Once I realized our electric, ‚Äúboils water only‚Äù kettle was producing a less than desirable cup of tea, I began a quest to find an affordable, temperature-controlled kettle. After several hours online searching electric kettles, reviewing specifications and customer reviews, I found the HadinEEon Temperature Variable Electric Kettle, model #GK2003CT. Upon reading Amazon‚Äôs numerous enthusiastic evaluations on HadinEEon kettles I decided to visit HadinEEon‚Äôs website to check out the company and their products before making a final decision. The first thing that impressed me is the way HadinEEon stands behind their products with an outstanding three-year (2+1-year free extension) warranty and 180 days free return shipping as evidenced by their one-year money back guarantee. Most of the other kettle brands reviewed up to this point offered a one-year warranty with no mention of money back guarantee or free return shipping. The next remarkable point is the HadinEEon commitment to priority customer support. The HadinEEon website shares consumer questions for each product with detailed answers, tips and support offered for each customer inquiry. I learned a great deal about the HadinEEon Temperature Variable Electric Kettle by reading the question and answer section. For me, the most relevant fact I learned is not to make tea in the kettle; pour the heated water into another container to make the tea. Making tea in the kettle could cause damage over time. On this journey I seriously considered other brand name temperature-controlled kettles which included a removable tea infuser to brew loose leaf or bag tea in one simple step. Perhaps that is why some of the other brands only offer a one-year warranty. The HadinEEon kettle and base boasts a beautiful streamline appearance with lovely borosilicate glass and stainless-steel design. The kettle has large 2.0L capacity with liquid measurements clearly marked. It possesses many safety features such as a Start/Stop button, cover has a lid release button, comfortable ergonomic heat resistance handle, boil dry protection and automatic shut-off. Kettle parts are FDA approved and the plastic is BPA free. No plastic on the inside; heated water will not encounter the plastic parts. No California P65 health warnings. Kettle is well balanced in hand with a wonderful pour. The multi-directional cord-free power base not only eliminates having a cord constantly in the wrong place dangling over counter edge or getting wet at the sink; it‚Äôs a fantastic solution for both lefties and righties. Favorite features ‚Äì the kettle purifies the water and has a removable scale mesh filter for cleaning. I can easily reach in the kettle through the wide-open lid mouth to clean without my arm getting trapped inside. I absolutely adore the control panel‚Äôs six variable temperature controls which show both the Fahrenheit temperature and type of beverage best suited to promote optimal brewing, the four-hour keep warm button and memory functions. Kettle communicates each stage of operation with audible beeps and visual blue light indicators that flash and illuminate the buttons and kettle base. Oh, did I mention the dancing bubbles or blue is my favorite color? Outstanding quality at a very fair price. The instruction manual is clear and concise with attention to detail focused on safety, kettle diagram, product features, operation, care & cleaning, 3-year warranty, descaling, storage, and customer support. Manual includes extensive temperature control table listing an astounding 66 beverages. Makes a perfectly delicious cup of tea! We are trying all the different types of tea in family member-only tea tastings. Great new household hobby during COVID19 pandemic as we isolate at home. Fortunately, Amazon has a vast variety of tea we can order online for next-day hands free delivery. Amazon will be busy this holiday season delivering our HadinEEon Christmas gifts!!!

  I previously had the 1.7L Chefman Electric Kettle with Tea Infuser & Keep Warm Function & loved it, but just short of 3 years, it finally died on me. I tried to be frugal during these trying times & would boil water & prep my teas & coffee ahead of time, but it was just too much to do with everything going on in my life. I needed another electric kettle.Enter this 2.0L HadinEEon Electric Kettle with strainer & Keep Warm Function. The first kettle I ordered never arrived, though Amazon did refund me which allowed me to place another order which arrived promptly the next day (with no extra shipping cost). Here's where this kettle excels over the chefman: intuitive temperature control buttons - they're on the handle with the label of what temperature to use when! No having to press buttons that reset each time to scroll through temperature presets. The Keep Warm function is also intuitive - press the temperature, press Keep Warm, then press start. My previous kettle kept resetting (though it would automatically keep my water warm whenever it boiled).Complaints: This is more a circumstance of my fridge, but the kettle is too big to fit underneath the faucet of my fridge, so I need a large measuring cup to fill my kettle. Another thing is the release button is on top of the kettle vs a button on the handle which I'm not a fan of, but overall, the kettle itself works fantastic & will boil 2 cups of water at 212 degrees Fahrenheit within a few minutes (the length it took me to type this paragraph).

  I ordered this pot to replace a different one I had. I love that it has different temperature settings for different types of teas. I noticed the top lid can get pretty hot. and you really have to push it down to latch it shut otherwise it spills when pouring. Relatives in the house didn't do this and thus there was a pretty big spill when I casually grabbed it to pour. The light is cool but not necessary. I like that it can hold the temp. Its fast, can get really hot - boiling. I've used it everyday for months and its still working well. I think overtime the writing on the rubber buttons might wear off - tho it hasn't yet so we'll see. But its a good pot overall. Happy with it. It's great for tea drinkers like myself.

  For the longest time, I have been using a pot with boiled water to make my coffee.  After looking at various different products, I decided to stick with this kettle based on the feedback from other consumers.  Also, the pictures showing the cool blue LED light while the water is boiling intrigued me.  So far, I am very happy with my purchase!  The kettle is really easy to use, really cool-looking, and prepares hot water in just a few minutes.  I think the only thing so far that I am just going to nitpick is the somewhat difficulty in drying the water on the inside.  Based on other reviews, I want to ensure that the kettle does not get rust due to negligence.

  Followed the cleaning directions of boiling a full pot (8 cups) at highest temperature (212 degrees) & pouring out.  Took over 10 minutes to heat.  Pot still strongly smells like glue & chemicals.  Did it a few times, and the strong smell remains.  The owner's manual says not to use chemicals, which I'm assuming is dish detergent, but I'm sure tempted to use it.  Haven't tested the temperature at each setting, so not sure how to rate it.  The item arrived yesterday, & I'm not sure if I'm keeping it yet.  UPDATE:  Returned it after 1 day of trying to remove the odors.  Seller seemed eager to send a mailing label and was prompt with the refund.  There are so many reviews on this item because the seller offers gifts for writing a review.

It fits all my qualifications. I have absolutely no regrets in my purchase. The variable temperature buttons, w/ the stay warm feature, topped with the blue light it has when it's boiling the water as an indicator. But the beeping sound for when the water is done is very soft so if you want something loud it may not be for you. Loud beep or not, didn't matter to me because I leave it on the stay warm feature as I run around the house to complete other tasks. It's exceeded my expectations. I use it mainly for boiling water for my tea because I'm a tea fanatic lol. Also, if you like Ramen noodles -- definitely a quick way to warm up your water. It's just really been a game changer. I am highly pleased and would recommend this 100%.

  This is super easy to use! It lights up when it is on and lights go off when it is done, even if you can't hear the beeping over other noises in the room. Temperature seems to be pretty accurate and pot hold in heat well so you don't loose too much heat if you forget to use the Keep Warm function. This is perfect for those long teas sessions where you really need to control your temp or you have burned or weak tea.

  The HadinEEon Electric Kettle is impressive.  I use it almost daily to boil water for tea, however, the kettle size holds enough water (approximately 8 cups) for multiple cups at a time.  It also is very handy when I need a quick cup of boiling water for ramen and other dry noodle soups.The kettle is made well and is somewhat of a ‚Äòshow‚Äô piece. I especially like the large see-thru glass; it seems unusually bright and clear.  I have had my kettle for almost a year and it does not show any wear; it looks as good as it did out of the box.  It is especially appealing to look at, unlike my previous electric kettle that showed the heating coils.  The retractable chord is a smart feature.  I like how it retracts into the base, leaving no chords stretched around the counter.  These features just add to the overall sleek look of this modern kettle.The kettle is very easy to use. The blue LED light at the base illuminates when it is heating and there is a small beep when it is ready to use.  The handle grip is very sturdy with a secure grip - making it very easy to pour without any drips or spilling.  The lid opens up wide, allowing me to clean out the kettle and rinse off after cleaning the buildup from hard water.Amazon delivered the package on time.  It was securely packed and easy to use out of the box.  Although I have not needed to contact customer service, based on the reviews I have read - the company seems to provide excellent customer service as well as a warranty for the kettle.I highly recommend you try this product.

  Boil-dry protection, once kicks in, needs long time to cool off to reset. The lid mechanism is too complex for its own good. It broke after a few months of use, now the lid does not stay closed. A simple removable lid would have been fine. Possibly because the lid does not stay closed water boils for too long before temperature sensor turns it off.

  I was so used to the office where we had a hotpot with water always ready for making tea. Now that I've been working form home, my previous electric kettle was such a pain to restart each time I needed hot water for another cup of tea. The HadinEEon Kettle works amazing at maintaining a constant 212 degrees (or other temps) for tea whenever I'm ready.  I tend to drink anywhere between 4 - 10 cups a day, so this kettle has been a godsend. My parents have a Cuisinart kettle, but there's broke and had to be sent back already... my HadinEEon is still tromping on after several months of constant use. I'm in love with this kettle... it is so fast compared to my old one, and it holds so much water! I made a great choice in this one.

  Advertised as heating water faster and quieter than most electric kettles on the market. I could have taken the very NOT quiet heating had the water come to 200F within a reasonable time. After the first day of waiting seemingly forever for the water to heat, I timed it the second day. 14 minute, 26 seconds. To get to 200F. Ridiculous.Also, the advertising/product description on Amazon is conflicting, confusing and misleading. The name of the product says, ""8 Big Cups 2.0L,"" whilst the info ""from the manufacturer"" lower on the page says, ""10 Cups, 1.8L."" Apparently math isn't HadinEEon's strength, nor is consistency. The kettle is 8 Cups, which is 1.89L, not 2L, not 10 cups.The base of the unit is oddly light, so it only sits flat when the kettle is on it, otherwise it is propped up by the cord. Speaking of the cord, ours was lazily bent during packing so it's indented to the point I had to look really close to see that it wasn't cut. (I don't trust that it won't tear along the indentation over time, posing a fire risk.)The pluses: The aesthetics are pleasing. The handle is cool to the touch. The lid opens easily for cleaning/drying. Despite the product dimensions stating this kettle is 10.5"" tall (perhaps that's referring to the box?), it is actually 9.5"" tall, which means I was able to fit it in my refrigerator door (filtered) tap.Due to the ridiculously long time to heat water, I've reported our kettle as defective. I'm hoping when the replacement kettle arrives to find that this one was, indeed, defective and to update my review accordingly.ETA: The replacement kettle heats in 13mins 24secs, a mere one minute faster than the first one we received and still more than twice what is advertised. I still do not recommend this kettle.

  We had used a Cuisinart tea kettle for years. It had similar features and was solid stainless steel. I thought I would try this one and and was glad I did. Being able to watch the water boil is cool and the blue light which goes off when you hit your temperature is a nice visual aid. It also has more capacity as far as how much water it will hold. It gets to temperature fast even when at full capacity. Only thing I wish was different was the volume of the ""beeper"". It is barely audible.

  I recently moved and was in need of a new electric kettle since I had been using my roommates. I looked at tons of kettles and I had come to realize I wanted some specific features:-Temperature control-Glass body so I can see the inside of the kettle to make sure I keep it clean-LEDs since I like LEDs and the aesthetic ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)-A lid that opens at least 90¬∞-Around 50 dollars and has mostly positive reviewsThis one seemed to fit the bill and I was tired of comparing kettles so I took the plunge. It arrived today and I used it to make some instant mix coffee and some various teas. Overall, I think this is a good kettle. I am mostly impressed and satisfied with my purchase:-Temperature control works well and has a good range-LED backlit buttons are made of rubber which have a nice texture / pushing feeling to them-I like the filter to the spout, when pouring I can definitely tell its filtering and not there for aesthetics-The cord is adjustable and wraps around the bottom of the base, so cable management is pretty easy-The kettle is pretty big (see pictures with my hand for reference)-The LEDs look great (see pictures) - pleasant to look at when powered on-The glass body looks great (see pictures) - I am no glass expert, but the appearance and touch definitely has me content with the quality of the glass, doesn't seem like it'll crack due to heating/cooling or anything-Has a 3 year warranty-Heats up the water faster than expected-Auto-shut off works well-Has a keep warm feature that I may or may not ever use, but it works when I used it-Lid opens 90¬∞ and the opening is very large, so I can both fill it easily and stick my hand in there to do cleaning (yay!)I do have some minor gripes about the design, but they aren't that big of a deal:-While the lid both opens wide and is a large diameter, it is also awkward to open. You have to pull back on a contraption / tab and lift the lid open by rotating it - unless I am mistaken, the lid is not springloaded. At about 45¬∞ it feels like there is some internal resistance to opening it further so you have to put in additional force to opening it. Not the biggest deal in the world, but it's annoying enough for me to notice since I am used to a springloaded lid that had a very simple and consistent functionality. I should also note that closing the lid doesn't have a very tactile experience either, you have to press down rather hard to get it to close all the way. I think this area could use some minor redesign.-The base is very light weight, so when you initially plug it in without the kettle attached, the rigidness of the cable is enough to keep it from laying flat. When you put the kettle down, it's no longer an issue, but perhaps adding some weight to it wouldn't hurt either.-The handle is made of plastic and doesn't have a lot of ""mass"" to it, so it doesn't feel very robust. The first thing I thought when I picked it up was, ""I wish this felt more rigid"", but it shouldn't be an issue. Just had a weird weight distribution when first picking it up to pour.Edit: Just wanted to note the 5 stars also applies to the seller's customer support and communication, very prompt response for warranty and feedback!

  We ordered this several weeks ago to replace an old plastic version we had previously used. I love the multiple choices of temperatures available for different types of tea and that it lists what type of tea for which each temperature should be used. Apparently I am not enough of a connoisseur of teas to realize prior to buying this that different types of tea require different brewing temperatures.  I also like that there are no exposed coils and that this kettle is glass. It also has a nice metal filter screen at the mouth, I am assuming to catch scale residue if it builds up, as they recommend against putting tea or coffee in the kettle so it won't stain. We have a reverse osmosis drinking water system so have had no problems with any build up as of yet. Another neat feature is the keep warm button, so that if you are planning to come back for another cup of tea, the water remains warm for you for up to 4 hours. We have not mastered the keep warm button as of yet, as it tends to shut off way before that for us. I am guessing it is user error and I will have to read the manual to find out how to properly use that function.  Overall, my husband and I are very pleased with this purchase.

I am not disappointed!It has a large heating surface and really does heat water quickly (though admittedly I haven't filled it past about 1 liter as I use it to make tea).  The temperature and keep warm controls are easy (no dialing in a specific temperature, just buttons to select what you want).  The manual comes with a handy guide of which temperature to select for each beverage type, though it would be nice if this guide was on a laminated card instead of in the booklette.  It's also a fairly good looking kettle!  One area for improvement could be an extremely low heat setting for making warm milk, but that was never a dealbreaker for me.All in all, was not disappointed.

It's easy to clean, you can easily tell when it's dirty and the bottom is flat - unlike other kettles which have coils and are impossible to clean. I like having all the different heat settings for different teas and the keep warm function is really nice as well. It's really sturdy and well built - the buttons, the lid, the handle - nothing feels cheap. I've been using this kettle daily for 7 months now (I heat up water about 5-7 times a day) and I can't imagine having any other kettle. This kettle is the one - you must get this if you're thinking about buying a kettle.

  I set an office in the second floor of our home and found it inconvenient to go down to heat water in the microwave.

  We have used this kettle daily, sometimes multiple times a day, for 3 months. We are very happy with our purchase and would not hesitate to recommend this kettle. Some of our favorite features are the high water capacity, water temperature options and speed of heating the water. I particularly appreciate the control buttons being on the handle. Our previous kettle had a lever at the bottom you pushed down to turn it on and it never worked right. The ease of use, sturdy construction and convenient features earns it an A+ at our house.

  This electric kettle is fantastic.  The user can easily select various temperatures through he click of a button.  Each button displays the temperature setting and the type of tea, which helpfully takes the guesswork out of remembering which setting for which tea.  Tea prepared a the proper temperature just tastes better.  The electric kettle has a sleek design of clear glass and metal, which means it will look fantastic sitting on your countertop matching other kitchen appliances.

All I can say is it's hands down flawlessly perfect and works precisely accurate to point. It also kept the water warm with selected temperature. Which means I can make tea or instant coffee in 12 hours. The hot water can also be used for cooking to cut the timing of cooking noodles, eggs, soup etc.I am totally pleased with my purchase of electronic kettle with verity temperature to choose from. I certainly recommend this item by all confidence. I am also uploading the videos that I recorded during the process.

  We replaced our old water heater with the HadinEEon Variable Kettle. We have enjoyed using it for the past 3-4 months, below are some insights:1. 6 Different temperatures for different teas, heats up quickly and kettle stays warm for a fair amount of time even without the constant reheating2. The hardware is of high-quality and the electric wire is very insulated (is not hot to the touch). I'm confident this kettle will last a long time.3. The inside is not prone to water damage as long as you empty it every night after use. Don't let water sit in the kettle for too long. If there is some minor water stains, you can add a bit of vinegar to water and boil to clean. Rinse after. Quite easy. Also try to use filtered water.4. Only complaint is that to open the kettle, the switch is on the lid instead of a button on the handle. (The temperature control buttons are the handle) So if the kettle is hot and you try to add more water, there could be heat & discomfort as you pry the lid open. Be careful there.

  I bought this kettle for my girlfriend for Christmas as she's been wanting an electric tea kettle for awhile. I did a lot of research before settling on this model, and so far I can say it's been perfect. She uses it far more than I do and she seems to love it. It makes tea preparation so much simpler than the stove top tea kettle we used to use. It's also infinitely easier to clean. The only temporary concern we had (and this would not be unique to this model) is we live in a city with harder water. Even with our filtered water it was leaving residue on the bottom that looked like it had burned to the bottom. However it turned out to come out pretty easily with some stronger cleaners and some elbow grease and look as good as new. Tea has become so much easier to prepare, and it looks sleek and beautiful doing it. The LED light looks pretty awesome when the lights are low. For me, though, it really comes down to performance. Thus far we've had no problems- it has met and exceeded expectations.

  I've always wanted an electric kettle that could variably control its own temperature for different teas. Im happy to say that this kettle does just that. With the different temperature selections working perfectly and the blue light indicators and beep when its done, it truly is a set it and walk away kind of kettle. Return when it beeps, and it pours like you'd expect it to. I usually make more than I need for 1 or 2 cups and then use the keep warm feature to keep it at the temp I selected - very handy!The only downside to this kettle is the time it takes to reach the temperature that you want, but its an acceptable timeframe if you want to be picky about a few degrees like me. So honestly at the end of the day - its not even a downside.

  We have been enjoying this kettle so far. I have another kettle (also a top Amazon kettle) that also has temperature settings and there are a few things I like about this one better. This kettle has real buttons that require a firm ""push"" to activate, whereas the other kettle uses kind of a touchscreen-type button array... turns out, I prefer the real buttons.Also, this kettle's ""keep warm"" setting stays on for longer than the other kettle's, so the water stays hot all morning.One difference is this has glass sides whereas the other kettle has stainless sides which (I believe) are double-walled. The glass sides of this kettle, being single-walled, would perhaps be less efficient at holding heat than a double-walled kettle but I suppose that's pretty minor.

  UPDATED REVIEW:The company who made the kettle surprisingly sent me a free replacement kettle unprompted. I was very surprised by this. I gave it a fair shake, and a similar problem persisted in that it would not stop boiling, but the workaround to this is to simply unplug the kettle once boiling. At least the replacement still turns on and didn't completely cease functionality like the original unit. I'm mostly updating this review because of the sensational customer support that I didn't expect at all. They're trying their best, so at least if you get a lemon it won't feel like all hope is lost if you just contact their customer support.ORIGINAL REVIEW:The first time I used it I was amazed at how fast it boiled the water, if a little disappointed that it didn't stop boiling until half the kettle evaporated. Then it never worked again. No matter what buttons I pressed, it would not function anymore. When plugging it in, it would light up for a quarter second and then turn off. Completely defective product.

Even if I spend the money later, that's still more money spent.Let me tell you, I'm very happy with what I bought! The multiple settings are fantastic, and it looks great too! My housemate even thought so too lol, especially when he saw the LED lights! It can get a little loud though, so be careful when others are sleeping!I like the fact that the cord coils underneath the heater, it really saves space! I also really appreciate the measurement markings. That with temperature control really made my decision for me. It even came with a warranty, and a little bag or citrus acid detergent to clean it. And man, is it FAST. Put 16 ounces in there and a minute later it's boiled. Make sure to listen for the beeps when it's done! It's a little soft, so it can be hard to hear if you're in another room, but I like that how quiet it is, since my housemate works at night and sleeps during the day.Do give it a try!

  I use this thing everyday and have it goin for like 6 hours a day. After 4 months it‚Äôs still going strong. The ring of lights is awesome, the keep warm feature is even cooler, and the capacity is the best I‚Äôve ever had in a kettle. It also gets to boiling way way faster than any gas-heated kettle I‚Äôve used. This thing‚Äôs the best price to quality ratio variable temp electric kettle choice in my opinion.The only bug I‚Äôve had with it is really insignificant and could just be my unit in particular. It‚Äôs that when I remove the kettle from the base for 5-10 seconds and it‚Äôs at boiling on ‚ÄòKeep Warm‚Äô, my unit will occasionally forget the settings and shut off. It usually remembers for up to 20 seconds of off-time as it‚Äôs supposed to, but sometimes it shuts off prematurely. Really doesn‚Äôt bother me at all though, as I‚Äôve got the muscle memory to just pop that sucker right back on to where I want it by sliding my thumb down the three buttons in 0.0035 milliseconds. And it‚Äôll instantly beep back to where it was it and we just keep sailing.I actually drove across the US with this, brewing pu-erh in the car. It can draw quite a bit of power to get water up to boiling so your mileage may vary trying to run this in a car haha (definitely not an intended or exactly safe use case, but it can be done). It‚Äôs held up really well and I consistently recommend this to all my friends.If you‚Äôre struggling on what to get, choose this.

It does take a few minutes to heat, so not as quick as microwave or running water through the Keurig.  I have noticed it making a buzzing noise on occasion when it is off.  If you lift the kettle off the base and set it back down, it stops.  It will recall the last setting you used if you just hit start.  The light in the pot goes off when it reaches temp and will turn back on when it reheats.  Does make a little noise, but that doesn't bother me.  You can hear it in the video.

  Purchased this kettle for my daughter, a neophyte tea lover, whose frequent consumption of hot water kept a stovetop kettle on constant simmer.  Rather than use all that gas, she got this kettle as a birthday present.  I selected it because it was the largest, lowest priced kettle that had both an automatic shutoff (to not run dry) and no plastic touching the water (other than the frame holding the screen in the spout) to avoid the odd taste that can impart.  As a bonus, it has both multiple heat settings (labeled for different types of tea - again, she's a neophyte) and a keep warm setting.  Honestly, though, this kettle heats so quickly that the keep warm function almost isn't necessary, but it is nice to have.  Plus, it looks nice on our counter, which wasn't critical, but, hey, why not?  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars on ""easy to clean"" was that it narrows at the top enough that getting my (adult male) hand into it takes just a bit of pressure to pop in.  Zero issues for my daughter or wife.  Highly recommend.  In fact, this purchase was our second...for a friend.

  What more can you ask for, you ask?PROS:- auto turn off feature is something a stovetop tea kettle can't compete with (while it's whistling for you to sprint and remove it before the whole house wakes up lol)- design is improved from older model. Lid opens wider and holds up on it's own- new added features to this model. Temp control, start/stop, keep warm option, bottom is wider than old model so the max line isn't as close to the top (so no chance of boil overs)- 212 F degree is approved by 2 generations older than me. My family is Asian so they like their coffee & tea scorching hot while I can't take the heat (literally) so it's nice that I can choose the desired water temp- has a filter pad- Large capacity, 8 cups. I thought I would rarely need to use the max capacity so I was hunting for a much smaller one (that doesn't exist btw). I actually almost always use the max when I'm cooking. Even for pasta I use the tea kettle then transfer the water to my gas stove. It saves me $ on my utilities.- Electric kettle is energy efficient & heats up faster VS stovetop only 35% heat energy is transferred to the potCONS:- the inside bottom of the kettle corrodes. Issue not resolved from the lower model; they just added another card to explain how to get rid of it but once you boil another pot it comes right back. I'm not sure what the metal is coated with or if the seal or corrosion seeps into the water you boil.

  This is a great kettle for heating water. Fast water heating and has a ""keep warm"" button that rewarms the water periodically (a must for my busy mornings). This design is sleek and modern - the base has a blue light which is very pleasant. I like the see-through nature of the kettle - easy to see when water is ready and when cleaning is necessary. Overall, I am thrilled with this kettle! My teenage boys even love it because it makes making ramen quick and easy! Go ahead - buy it - you'll love it!

  So gross!  I bought this kettle in July 2020 and very soon thereafter I did notice some discoloration on the bottom.  It continued to get worse, but I thought it was burnt on the outer part of the kettle, beneath the glass.  It was still working, but then it continued to get worse and I took a closer look today (12/26/20) and saw little pieces of the burnt metal floating in the water.  Who knows how long we have been ingesting these toxic particles in our tea and coffee?!  So disgusted and disappointed by a 5-star review product!  Thankfully, I had purchased the insurance plan.

    On Our Second Electric Kettle!
  
",4.0,Peter Roug,"Reviewed in the United States February 28, 2021","









  
  
    
  This kettle had replaced our previous big box store brand kettle that only lasted about a year. We use this for our business to serve tea to guests. One feature that is super great about this kettle is the 4 hours it stays warm, which for our needs is the perfect amount of time. One word of warning, after about a year of use we did find that the little clips holding the lid down started to become brittle and break off into the kettle, this happened after a year of everyday use for about 12 hours per day. This is the second one we have purchased and couldn't be happier, we will continue to replace this one with the same in the future.

  We purchased the HadinEEon Variable Temperature Electric Kettle in Jan 2021 as a replacement for our metal electric kettle. We use it almost daily and would definitely purchase again/recommend to friends and family. We like it because: its made of glass, holds 8Cups/2L of water, has a wide opening for easy cleaning, its sturdy and feels well built, boils water quickly, and has different temperature options.Our only complaint is the water spots/hard water scaling at the bottom (see picture). To be fair, the product isn‚Äôt advertised as limescale resistant and we knew this was common from reading other reviews so we didn‚Äôt think it was fair to reduce the rating. HadinEEon tries to address this issue in two ways. First, the spout has a built-in mesh filter to catch any particles when pouring, though we haven't had enough build up to be worried about that. And secondly, HadinEEon provides a ""Citric Acid Detergent"" for cleaning, though we haven't tried it yet so we can‚Äôt confirm it works. Full disclosure, we don‚Äôt use filtered water for boiling and we‚Äôre on the US east coast where the water tends to be less hard.Overall we‚Äôre very pleased but its important to know that this electric kettle is not scaling resistant.

  I love this electric tea kettle. I really enjoy hot tea. What I like best is that I can heat the water to the best brewing temperature for each type of tea I drink. I used to have to try to catch the kettle before it started boiling for my green tea. Now I can set the kettle at 175 for green tea with the keep warm button and walk away. When I get back it has been held at the right temperature and I can brew several cups in a row. My husband prefers iced tea made with black tea. He likes being able to heat up 8 cups of water to boiling hot so quickly. I also like the nice blue lights. It is easy to tell that the unit is on and looks good on the counter.

  I spent a long time looking at temperature controlled electric kettles to buy; I drink a lot of tea, and wanted to start preparing it at the desired temp. When quarantine started I began working from home and started using this kettle... a lot. As in, every morning without fail, sometimes in the afternoon, and occasionally for bedtime tea. I can honestly say I LOVE this kettle!!It comes to temp quickly and isn't too loud. The bright colors are nice and it also has a ""stay warm"" feature that keeps water to temp. The package says it will for up to 4 hours, but I have only used it for 1 or 2 hours, so can't confirm.Minor inconveniences, the top doesn't always ""lock"" into place, so I just give it a little bop before starting to hear the telltale ""click"". (I have accidentally used with the top barely open and it was fine though. Just make sure you don't pour that way!!). Also, more of a region thing, but since we have super hard water where I live the bottom and sides of it get chalky/cloudy REALLY easily. Hasn't been bad with fingerprints, though!Overall, I would definitely purchase it again. The extra $40 for a name brand kettle doesn't seem worth it to me, especially since this one performs great!

  The kettle is very attractive and works well. I especially like that it is glass and the bigger 2.0 L capacity. I really wanted the variable temperature options since we drink a lot of tea. Quieter than my previous kettle.Initially, I thought there was a problem because for all of the temperatures except for 212Àö F, the unit kept starting and stopping. I contacted the manufacturer via email (support@hadineeon.net) and they replied the same day. They supplied the following explanation:Here I would like to explain that when the temp is set other than 212, it will take a longer time to reach the target temp. When the water temp is about to reach set temp, the kettle will be in a start-stop adjustment for water to gradually approach set temp. That means the kettle starts and stops heating over several times for reaching target water temp. Once the water reaches the target temp, the kettle turns off immediately and make beep sounds.They were correct and that is exactly how the kettle works. Since I now understand this, I realize that the kettle works extremely well. I am very happy with it and with the customer service that I received. I would definitely recommend this kettle.

  I bought this to replace my old kettle that died, and selected this one specifically for the temperature control because I am an avid tea drinker. Using the correct temperature for different types of tea is important to get the best flavor profile, so it is important to me that the temps are accurate. Welp, I used a thermometer to see how accurate the temperatures are, and they're all about 10F degrees cooler than the setting I selected. I can understand a couple degrees of variance but 10F is way off. This is extra irritating to me because the kettle takes a while to reach the (incorrect) temperature and makes a show of turning on and off to ""adjust"" the water to the supposed correct temperature. It is neither fast to heat the water, precise in temperature, or good for getting the optimal flavors out of tea as it has been advertised to do.The only good things I have to say are that it has good safety features such as dry boil protection and auto shut off. Having the kettle be made of glass is nice as it is really easy to see the water level. It is easy to clean as well.If having an accurate temperature is important to you though, this kettle is a hard pass.

  Bought this to replace an old, cheap plastic one from college. This one looks so much better and is no doubt better for me than plastic. We drink lots of tea in our house, and this does well. It heats water quickly, and to the specified temperature*. I haven't gotten out a food thermometer to verify each temperature setting, but it seems to be fairly accurate, and you can taste the difference when you make tea.Auto-shutoff when it reaches temp - this works well for all but 212F. I live at ~5000 ft (1524 meters) elevation, so it never reaches 212F*, and thus never shuts off. This isn't a big deal for me, as I don't usually wander away when boiling water, and if I were really concerned, I could just use the 200F setting, which stops just fine. Asking the engineers to add a barometric pressure sensor to auto-adjust the boiling point seems like it would be overkill.*Water boils at 203F (95C) at 5000 ft (1524 meters)

  I use this kettle for three main purposes: i) heating water for hot cereals, ii) heating water for tea, and iii) heating water quickly for use in cooking.  So far, the kettle has been easy to use and heats water quickly.  Before the first use, the manufacturer recommends filling it and boiling the water twice.  That took about 15 minutes in total; super easy.The only minor thing to note is that after setting the desired temperature, you have to press ""Start"" to begin heating the water.  I realize that sounds obvious, but the device lights up as soon as you press any button (including the temperature selection button) so you might get the impression that it is already heating before pressing Start.Overall, seems like a solid purchase.

  This kettle looks very attractive with the blue lighting around the base when it heats, and glass walls.It costs more than I would generally want to pay for a kettle - but since it says the base won't rust and the lid looks solid (2 problems we've had with cheaper kettles over the years) - I'm willing to pay a bit more if it lasts longer!It's simple to operate and has a large capacity.  It doesn't seem to be faster than other kettles at boiling water, but it is quieter, which I appreciate.

  I researched several brands online and I choose this tea kettle.  I enjoy various types of tea: black, oolong, white, etc. and with this kettle I have the temperature choices for each variety.  I also chose this one which had a clear glass kettle to be able to make sure that both the inside of the kettle, and the water, were pristine.  My favorite feature (which my previous tea kettle lacked) was the ""Keep Warm"" option for an easy hot !  2nd cup of tea.  If there would be one thing I'd change:  I wish the kettle was a little smaller.  All in all I would highly recommend this tea kettle.

  We were looking for a kettle that allows us to control the temperature of the water as we make pour over coffee every day. We were using a tea pot and let me tell you this kettle is a game-changer. Not only is it easy to use and to clean, but it looks great as well! That is very important when you have it on your counter all the time. If you are looking to up your barista game or simply have hot water fast -- this is the kettle for you.

  This electric kettle is very easy to use and boils the water pretty fast within minutes! What I like is that I am able to keep my boiled water warm for a long time, so I can always come back to get more hot water for my tea or coffee. The blue LED lights are a nice touch and notify me when my water is ready! It is sturdy and durable and also has different temperature settings for how you like your tea or coffee! The price is also reasonable and I know this kettle will last me for many years! This kettle also has memory settings, so it will know how your preferences!

  First, customer service was excellent.  They stood by their warranty and refunded the cost of my purchase without hesitation, even offering additional gift cards.  I recommend this company overall.  In the case of this particular kettle, after just a few months of use, the glass broke irreparably near the top of the handle.  Until then, we really liked the kettle.  Having never used a kettle with temperature control, we didn't know what we were missing.  For tea it is essential, which we now appreciate.  The capacity and features of this kettle are very good, the accuracy of the temperature OK, although not within 2 degrees of setting (we verified with a calibrated thermometer), but the reliability of this particular unit was unacceptable.  We replaced the broken kettle with a Cuisinart CPK-17 PerfecTemp 1.7-Liter Stainless Steel Cordless Electric kettle, which we find superior in all ways, apart its smaller capacity.  If you are fortunate enough to get a HadinEEon unit that does not have a problem (and apparently many people have had reliable units) then you will probably be quite pleased with it.

  I got this kettle for Christmas so I've had it for a few months and it is great! It is so pretty and works just as beautifully. The pre-set temps make it easy to correctly brew a wide range of teas without any trouble and the low profile of the kettle and base mean I can leave it on the counter without losing too much room. We do have very hard water where I live so some build up occurs on the heating element but that was expected (it happens in my stovetop kettle also) and is easily cleaned with the included cleaner or vinegar. I am very hapoy with this purchase!

    Only beeps for boiling setting
  
",4.0,Ann Krause,"Reviewed in the United States October 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  We are pleased with the purchase and the kettle is working well. Unlike our previous kettle that had pressure-sensitive buttons that didn't always work, the buttons on this kettle are actual physical buttons and they work really well. There are several temperature options on this kettle and the one thing that is a little confusing is that if you choose a setting other than the boiling option, the kettle does not beep when it comes up to temperature. You can kind of tell that it is ""done"" when the heating elements stop heating, but other than that, there's no real indicator that the water is ready. I like the glass kettle so you can see the water boiling or heating up and the blue lights that come on while it is heating up. We use it a LOT for tea and my son loves it for making french press coffee too

  Since moving to the United States (US) four years ago we have tried a number of Kettles that work on 110 Volts - We were used to the speed of boiling water on the 220 Volt Kettles widely used outside the US where water boils within 4 or 5 minutes and not a single kettle we've had since we arrived boils any quicker than 8 minutes when filled to capacity.The HadinEEon not only looks beautiful, but boils exceptionally faster than anything we've seen using 110 Volts - We're back to the 4 to 5 minutes we were used to on 220 Volts.The fact that we can ""forget"" to close the lid and kettle will still turn off is also an added bonus. Sadly upon a few occasions with the other kettles we've owned I have failed to ensure the lid is closed tightly - if not watched (and stopped) the kettle will keep boiling and then boil dry and sometimes never work again - I love the fact that the HadinEEon is smart enough to not have that happen.

  Bought this to replace a Zojirushi Water Boiler that I had used for years.  Had issues keeping product from rusting and temperature control.  Researched several models and looked at higher priced models like Oxo and Breville.  Settled on this as the price was fair and there were lots of features e.g. keep warm, and several temp settings for different teas and coffee.  Boils water well but not the fastest compared to other reviews electric kettles but fast enough.  Some small improvements (1) louder chime when the boiling temp has been reached, (2) light stays on until the boiling temp reached, seems to go one and off discriminately.  Other than that very happy with the product and would recommend.

  I've had a bunch of electric kettles.  This is my first with the multiple temperatures, something ESSENTIAL if you like white tea which is seriously bitter if you heat the water to boiling.  I'm excited to have white tea!  What I like about this kettle is that it is glass since it's simply COOL to watch the water boil and this kettle also has blue lights that go on as it's heating, adding to the coolness.  It heats up QUICKLY (way faster than either the stove or microwave for a family's worth of water).  All of us are psyched for that.  I'm not sure why it has a mesh at the spout.  I guess it's for people who actually brew loose tea in the kettle, but for people like me who just boil water, it's an unnecessary piece, and my last kettle (different maker) had one of those that snapped off.  Overall, I'm very pleased with this kettle.

  Product arrived double boxed and in perfect condition.  The HadinEEOn Kettle appears very well made, everything fits tightly, no rattling or loose parts.  Instructions on using and caring for product are well written and easy to understand.  Some have mentioned a issue with the length of power cord being to short but I had no issue with placement in my kitchen.After turning the unit on, I cycled one full pitcher on boiling as instructed and then began heating fresh cold water at the different temperatures that can be selected via the control panel on the kettle handle.  I tested each temperature setting using two separate digital thermometers and both digital thermometers were either spot on or within 1 degree of the temperature selected on the unit.HadinEEon Electric Kettle will get much use for heating water to very specific temperatures for teas I steep.  This is a very good product and I highly recommend it.  The kettle has a three year warranty as well.....

    Keep Warm Feature is Amazing
  
",5.0,Ian W. Nixon,"Reviewed in the United States March 2, 2021","









  
  
    
  There are a few things I really appreciate when looking at buying an electric kettle and they may not be the obvious ones. First, the Keep Warm setting is so nice. I make my coffee in the morning and I may not want another cup for an hour or more. By keeping the water warm, it takes mere seconds to get back up to the temperature it needs to be to have hot coffee or tea. Another small but important feature is that it's clear. To me, this goes beyond basic aesthetics, even though the blue light is cool. Anyone who has ever owned a solid colored kettle knows that it's annoying that you can't see how much water is left in it and if you're anything like me, you're constantly checking it to make sure you don't heat up an empty kettle. The last thing, which is also small, are the cup line markings. If you need a specific amount of hot water for something, having those line markings is really nice to have to quickly reference.

After the kettle was ready, I measured the temperature with my trusty Thermapen, and I was reading between 180.5-181.0 F (pictured). Not bad!Next I put it on the full boil mode and put the water into a very nice, rolling boil. The lights make it very clear if the kettle is heating or not (pictured).The kettle itself was packaged very well, which is important as a glass item. It was also easy to unpack and get running.

  First things first, I am being paid to write this review. That being said, I bought this product with my own money, and I use it often. I love tea! And I hope to use this product for a long time. This kettle makes the best oolong tea I've ever had in my entire life! I really like that the electronic components on the outside of the bottom of the kettle are recessed above the bottom. That way I can put it in my sink and not worry about the electronics getting wet. I will say that for the green tea button seems to make my normal green tea a little bitter, so I normally use the delicate setting when making my green tea. The alarm that sounds when the water has reached the desired temperature, isn't loud enough to hear over music or from the next room. But I'm ok with that. I'd rather a quieter alarm than one that is too loud.  And the blue light while boiling is a nice touch. And I do think the kettle work better with room temp water, then with cold water. Lastly, it's not the kettles fault that I forget to press the start button sometime. lol

I also like the temperature settings and how they are labeled for each type of tea. I like the blue light when it is running and that the base takes up minimal room. Auto shut off is great but I do wish it had an alarm of some sort. The only word of caution is that the markings on the side for quantity aren't correct. My french press holds 2 cups and the 2 cup line is much less water - this wasn't a deal breaker though.I've never taken the temperature of the water to say if it's exactly the correct temperature either but it's hot when it's done.The open button on the lid is slightly awkward and I can see how it would break easily. Also not a deal breaker for me.I searched fairly thoroughly since most of the reviews had something fairly negative on every brand.

I love the temperature control, keep warm function, and how it beeps with every click and when the boiling is done. THE KEEP WARM FUNCTION is especially amazing!! it helps so I don't have to reboil the water every time.However, one downside though, the lid of the kettle gets really hot, even from outside, after boiling water. This makes the button to open the lid really hot to touch too after boiling water. Perhaps a button that automatically props up the lid would be good too, for this one we have to press and hold the button and open the lid manually.However, this is just one minor thing. If you wait some time to open the lid after boiling, it should be fine.Overall, really great kettle!! Love it!! I love the packaging too, everything was really safe.

  I've been using this daily to heat water for a french press.  Bought it a couple months ago and it has been great.  Checked the water temp with an instant read thermometer and it was right where it should be.My old method was a tea kettle on the stove, which required monitoring the water temp.  This is much more convenient, I can just turn it on and get breakfast ready while it holds at temp until I'm making coffee.It's nice, buy it.

  I'm very happy with this purchase.  I love the fact that I only need to push two buttons in order to get the temperature that I want and to get it to start up.  With other kettles, you have to push one button a few times in order to get the desired temperature.  I like the blue LED lights that are on while the water is warming up, it looks really nice.  Just remember that it's glass!  I accidentally tipped this kettle over, and had to buy another (totally my fault).All in all, great product!

  I like the blue light and little beeps it makes to tell me when the water is at the correct temperature. I like that it tells me what temp to brew what, like green tea vs coffee - they are best at different temperatures and I am all for being extra like that. It is a great size to make multiple cups of whatever: coffee, ramen, etc throughout the day. It doesn‚Äôt rust or at least it has not for me and I‚Äôve had this for a long while now. It doesn‚Äôt take up much counter space and I can easily store it away. It just looks good overall. I wanted something to give me hot water fast because I got tired of putting a kettle on the stove. I think this is one of my best kitchen appliances. It‚Äôs better than instant hot water at the sink because again I can pick the temperature I want it to be. Buy it. You won‚Äôt regret it.

  After reading several electric kettles reviews online, I landed on this one due to the ratings, the different temperature controls, and the keep warm feature. I recently received it and it's already been a fantastic addition to my kitchen. Heats water quickly to the proper temperature for different types of tea, and boils quickly for oatmeal and other instant meals/soups. I should have purchased one of these years ago to step up my tea game!  Had green tea yesterday and with the temperature control it was the best cup of green tea I have had in a while. It's also easy to get your hand inside to wipe dry after use.  It's a bit bigger than expected, but that's okay - well worth the counter space!

  I love this kettle. I bought one for myself, personally, to have in our master suite. After having it for a few weeks, I ended up buying it for my day spa. We have it sitting in our reception area. The best feature is that it kicks on and off to maintain a constant temperature. Being opened in our facility for eleven hours a day, every guest from the first to the last, can get a cup of tea at any time. It is very quick to heat up, usually in under three minutes depending on the temperature you choose. It was easy to set up and easy to figure out. Just make sure the only thing you are heating is water! You cannot heat up soup or apple cider in this, as it does not heat properly. I can tell you that during January, I was very sick. My husband made me Lipton cup of soup by just having the kettle on all day and pouring the heated water over the soup contents in my cup. He heated it on the highest setting (220), and the soup was softened in about a minute. I actually prefer this over the microwave.

  I will get a free gift if I write this review, however I would like to inform you that is not the reason why I gave this kettle 5 stars. It has 6 different buttons for temperature options from 160-212 degrees F, a ‚ÄúKeep Warm‚Äù button and a ‚ÄúStart/Stop‚Äù button. I have not seen a kettle with all of these options packed in one kettle. If you are picky with your tea taste, this kettle is just for you. It is a little pricier than other kettles, but for the options and ease of cleaning I think it‚Äôs worth it. I have only used it once so far, I will update my review if something goes wrong in the future. If you press the highest temperature setting it take a little longer than other kettles I‚Äôve used, so if you are not in a rush to get your water boiled quickly, I definitely recommend this product!

  I love this kettle. Got it to be able to vary the temperature for the different teas and coffee we drink and it works great. It makes a really big difference for green tea - it keeps our favorite matcha from burning.

We liked it so much, I got a second one for my parents for Christmas and they've been enjoying theirs as well. I like that it's glass, easy to see when it needs cleaning, and I like that it lights up blue when it's working, just like my old kettle (which, unfortunately, didn't have the various temps and keep warm features).

  I wanted to buy a second electric kettle so that I could brew tea at home and at work. My previous electric kettle is also variable temperature, which for me is a must! It makes brewing different teas so much easier than when I used to guesstimate the temperature with a stove top kettle. This one brews just a little bit slower than my other one BUT it is also much quieter. My family used to joke that my old one sounded like a jet plane taking off in the house! I appreciate that it is not as loud.I also love the tempered glass, and as others have stated it is quite fun to watch your water heat up! The blue light stays on until it reaches the desired temperature. Then, the light turns off and it beeps to let you know that your water is ready. Additionally, cleaning is a lot easier because the lid is wide enough to wipe the bottom of the kettle, and I believe that the filter can be removed and washed as well. Love

  We purchased the HadinEEon Variable Temperature Electric Kettle in February of this year (2020).  It was an instant hit, and the honeymoon is not over, as of June 2020.  The separate, individualized temperature settings for various purposes and products (green tea, black tea, boiling, etc.) are very handy and allow for specificity, something you don't usually find in electric kettles or hotpots.  Clear glass with well-defined markings makes it simple for users to see how much water remains and what needs to be added to fill 'er up.  The ""keep on"" reheating feature is handy for those who might forget they set it to heat for a cuppa and get distracted, wandering back to the pot later.  Users will find a kettle that is ready for action, not cold water in need of an extended warmup.  Highly recommended!

It‚Äôs a good size and the blue light doesn‚Äôt annoy my eyes, which I was concerned about before purchasing.I didn‚Äôt need the ability to adjust temperatures to exact degrees, so the 6 or so presets are sufficient for my needs.

  I‚Äôve had this kettle since March now and I love it. I use it every day at least 3-4 times and it works great. The water heats quickly and the item needs very little cleanup.

  The product is very cool.  I ordered it in order to make coffee in the morning and I ended up making coffee multiple times a day.What makes this product excellent and what I like the most about it:-- Multiple temperature controls: I can control the heat level of the water.  For coffee which I make with faucet water I use the maximum temperature control.  If the water was already boiled before, I set it to other control to make the water hot faster-- Blue light: I like the design of the kettle and the blue light that shines when the water gets heated.-- Overall product: Product is relatively light in weight and easy to clean.  I just rinse it with water and let it dry.  Water boils in around 5-7 minutes on maximum temperature controlOverall excellent product.

  I‚Äôve had this kettle for a few weeks now and I‚Äôm fully satisfied with how it functions.

  I purchased this water heater for multiple reasons.1. Its lid opens up at 90 degree angle.2. Its filter mesh can be removed for cleaning3. It has multiple temperature settings.It worked excellent on all these parameters and would recommend this product. Two things though, I wished this had was 1. to have a lower temperature setting as well. Its temperature setting starts at 160 F. My daily use is to drink lukewarm water. So, a temperature setting of 80 degrees or 100 F would have been much useful. 2. It does not seem to remember the last temperature setting that I had chosen. It always start with 212 F.  This is I believe because it does not have any internal battery memory to save the last user state.Overall a good product! I would have given it a 4.5 star, given an option.

  I love this electric tea kettle! What is great about it compared to others is that there are selections on how hot you want the water. As a tea drinker, water temp is important and just using a regular kettle or the microwave doesn't give you that flexibility. You don't want to overheat your green tea to bitterness nor do you not want to get all the flavor of your black tea if not hot enough. This kettle takes all the guesswork out of that. It heats fast and has been very reliable. I have seen similar electric kettles for double the price - you are paying for the name. LOL. I also use it to heat water for my instant soups and oatmeal. This is a great buy.

  I bought this as an upgrade from my old electric kettle and I am very satisfied with it.  Nothing about it feels flimsy and it boils water quickly and reliably.  I use it daily to boil the water for our household iced tea habit, so I only tend to use the maximum temperature setting.  I did test some of the lower settings out with my IR thermometer for fun and the kettle was pretty accurate.  Having a glass carafe is a definite upgrade from my old kettle as I no longer have to guess what the water inside the kettle is doing at any given moment.  Plus, the LED light that illuminates the water gives it a bit of a lava lamp effect.  I also like the feature that will hold the set temperature once the water heats up so I don't have to repeat the boiling process if I get distracted before it finishes.  I would definitely buy this again.

  I am a coffee nerd. Making a good brew depends on multiple factors especially when using a French Press or pour over. This kettle allows me to get the water to the perfect temperature and hold it there if needed. I've measured the temp with a thermometer and it is spot on.  It takes a little longer to get to your desired temp - as the kettle starts and stops on its way so as not to overheat. But I've worked out how long the stages are and manage that as part of my brewing approach. Going to a boil takes less time. It's an attractive kettle - the glass is lovely but it does show the build up of limescale! I live in a hard water area. But it's easy to clean and bring back to its full glory. The boil noise is fine - a little louder than most but no big deal. There are plenty of other things in the kitchen which make more noise! I'd buy again - a few months in it's going strong.

  This is definitely the best electric kettle you can get. It combines high tech and functionality seamlessly.

The 2.0L high capacity glass makes it great for all uses especially when you have a large number of guests. The blue LED light is a very nice touch of sophistication as it sets itself apart from the rest of any appliance. When the unit boils water you just want to look at it as it is a beautiful unit as it is functional. I couldn't be happier with my purchase. I highly recommend this unit. With a 3-year warranty (which no other manufacturer offers, as far as I know) you should have a piece of mind drinking many cups of tea for the next few years as I do.

  Living alone, I would typically heat up water (for myself) in the microwave. While visiting my sister overseas, I got to experience the luxury of an electric kettle.

This kettle is great because you can select the temperature to match your preferred tea (or other drink). The blue light is icing on the cake. I'm very happy with the purchase.

    Stay Warm Function Unreliable

  One of the reasons I purchased this unit was there is a stay warm function. This function is supposed to keep the water at the correct temperature as long as the kettle is placed back on the heater within 20 seconds. I have poured water out of the kettle and put the kettle back immediately and it doesn't keep the stay warm on. I did see that this function only works after the kettle has fully heated, which I waited for.Also the notification that the kettle is to temperature is very quiet and very hard to hear.Overall the kettle does heat water and it does hold the temperature when the stay warm function is working, but it isn't reliable enough compared to other brands.UPDATED REVIEW:I was provided with a new kettle after writing the review. The new kettle works as advertised and the company was very supportive of their warranty and product.

  This product works as advertised. There are 6 temperature settings that you can choose from and it'll beep when the water has reached the desired temperature and shutoff. It'll also continuously keep the water at the desired temperature if you hit the `hold` button which is useful if u want to keep the water at the desired temperature for a long time. I also liked the feature where you can take it out of the base and put it back in and it'll retain the hold setting (as long as you put it back within a reasonable amount of time).My pet peeves with this are:1) The lid is a little hard to close as you need to exert some effort to close it. There's no soft or easy close feature2) After 5 months of near-daily use, the lettering is starting rub off and fade, in particular, the start/stop and the hold buttons

I liked the large capacity: it is 2 liter compared to 1.8 most companies, including Hamilton Beach, offer‚Äîexactly what I needed to fill the thermos I use; the previous one was just little bit not enough and I had to boil water twice to fill the thermos. I slightly do not like that the opening clip is located on the lid, rather than a there would be a button to open it. But that is a minor inconvenience. Also shut off time after it starts boiling is little longer than with Hamilton Beach, but definitely not the 4 minutes mentioned in one of the reviews I saw (about 15- 30 seconds depending on the amount of water).  I would definitely recommend it.

I have some special green tea I got recently and I feel that it tasted  better after using the exact temperature setting.

I was looking for one that would help making tea easier since I don't love microwaving my water and don't like waiting for my water to boil on the stove. With this kettle, I can set the temperature and let it do it's thing! It is very sleek looking and I love the blue light that appears when it is heating up the water. I have yet to try any settings other than the Green and white tea settings for green, herbal, and fruit teas but I'm excited to eventually try the French Press option at some point! I like the auto shut off feature as well so you don't have to remember to turn it off and just have to remember to turn on the ""Keep Warm"" option if you want the water to stay hot. Based on looks and performance, this kettle is definitely worth the purchase! I've only had it since Christmas but I am confident that it will hold up against the test of time!

  After doing some research, this electric kettle model had the best overall rating for my price range, so I decided to test it out. I am in love! I've had this kettle for two months now and use it every single day. This unit has the ideal temperature programmed for six different tea types (black, green, herbal, etc.). It just takes a couple minutes to reach the selected temperature, and then the unit will keep the water warmed to the ideal temp for up to four hours with the ""keep warm"" option. It does not give off nearly as much heat as a traditional stovetop kettle. While it does get hot, it is also safe to touch - you will not get burned if you bump it. Easy to rinse, change, and reconnect the kettle. Would definitely recommend!

  Just got the kettle.  It worked as described in the operators manual.  When I lived in Ireland everyone had an electric kettle.  Features important to me are: a variety of temperatures (for green tea and my French roast coffee) and the keep warm function.  I like the glass because I can see what is going on.  Feels very solid.  Heavy enough so it would not be easy to knock it over but not so heavy I can't handle it.

  We have been using a $100 Chantal stove top tea kettle for years. However I decided I wanted something electric that I could set-and-forget with the temp and start doing the process of making my morning French Press. Getting the temperature right is a big deal for me, as I like my coffee to be made right (which is why I use a French Press LOL).  The HadinEEon Variable Temperature Electric Kettle is great for my purposes and suits my tea-making wife as well with all the other temp for teas also build into the options. Plus my wife loves the blue hues when the pot is on, it's totally cool and totally ""pretty.""  And it looks great just sitting there on the counter. Get this kettle, you'll love it.

    Perfect for making tea
  
",5.0,LM in NJ,"Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2019","









  
  
    
  This is one great product! It takes less than 10 minutes to boil the max. 2 L of water. The design is very elegant and the quality of the kettle feels top notch. I like that it lights up while heating the water and the light shuts off when it's done. The various temperature setting makes it easy to make perfect tea every time at the right temperature. The keep warm feature is very handy when we have friends over for tea or coffee and chat. We will always have the water ready at the right temperature without having to run back and forth to the kitchen to boil more! However, the pot, being glass, probably is less energy efficient for keeping warm for long period of time than our traditional insulated water heater, but it is perfect for a short time. Therefore, we will stick to using it for making tea and coffee, particularly when having guests.

  Great kettle, super fast heating and I love the keep warm option, my previous electric kettle did not have this feature.  I like that this one is larger than most, 2.0L which is roughly 8 cups.  I drink a lot of tea throughout the day so I really appreciate the larger size and the warming options.  I also drink various teas, this pot has 6 different heating levels so my delicate green or white ginger teas don‚Äôt burn and turn bitter and the higher temp is great for my Darjeeling and other black teas.  Steeping your teas at the proper temps make such a big taste difference.  And it‚Äôs pretty, not a deal breaker but I like that it looks nice sitting on the counter.

  I bought this kettle because my husband and I drink mate (yerba mate) everyday and we like the water to be a specific temperature, so the temperature control was a key feature for us. We also use it for tea, coffee, and boiling water. The kettle works well, heats up fast, and has a nice appearance. I particularly like the ""keep warm feature"", because I often walk away or start doing something else after starting the kettle, so I don't have to worry about the water losing heat. We also like that it is not very bulky, which is good as we don't have much counter space. One small criticism is that the volume markings are inaccurate, so 2 cups are more like 1.5 cups, but this is no big deal for me. Overall, I recommend this kettle!

  We purchased this electric kettle a few months ago and have loved the ease of heating water to various temperatures and doing so quickly since then! Boiling water on the stove in a kettle takes a lot longer and its harder to know if its the right temperature for our various kinds of teas. I love the added feature of the lights while it is heating up and the measurements on the outside of the kettle to help me know how much water to boil for any given mug or travel cup. My only issue is that the bottom is starting to show some white staining, presumably from minerals in our tap water. Not sure how to get these deposits out, but haven't had an issue related to it. Really great electric kettle!UPDATE: The company contacted me with information about how to clean the build-up on my kettle. Very helpful and great customer service!

  This kettle works quite well. It is big and sturdy, and holds a lot of water. And it can bring water to a boil quite fast. My only issues with it is that it seems to sometimes take just as long to heat water to some of the lower, preset temperatures as it does to boil water. And sometimes it seems to get confused with these lower temperatures: the LED light goes on and off for a while, but it doesn't seem to be heating the water very much, until, after a while of this, it finally beeps to indicate the water is done. Maybe it is trying to fine tune to a precise temperature, but I can't tell. Also, it can be hard to tell if the ""keep warm"" function is on when its heating water because the ""start/stop"" button above it is much brighter when illuminated. However, besides these very minor quibbles, it has served me well so far.

  This kettle works great. It is fast and the blue light when it is on is pretty. I like that the filter screen over the spout is removable. This pot is replacing my previous one of another brand because that screen disintegrated and wasn't replaceable. The only difficulty I had was working the lever to open the lid all the way- it is stiff and a bit of a challenge for arthritic fingers. It seems to be loosening up some so maybe that just needed to be used for a while. I'd recommend this.a couple of weeks later I am editing this to give 5 stars. I emailed the company with a question and they got back to me immediately. Impressive customer service! I've also noticed that with use and familiarity the tab on top to open the lid is easier to use.

  water typically boils at 212 degrees F.  But at a mile high, it boils at around 202 degrees.  When I used the default (212 degree) setting the water kept boiling to reach the higher temp... it seems unnecessary.  Maybe that's why some kettles use a pressure sensor rather than a temperature sensor.In this case I simply choose the 202 degree setting.  It's perfect!  The water boils but doesn't need to overboil, consequently saving more energy.  I've used the kettle for more than 10 days and am very satisfied.While the blue light isn't necessary, it is pretty cool looking.

  I tried several less expensive Electric kettles before settling on the HadinEEon. I am very happy after choosing this one. It holds a good amount of water, has a small filter in the spout to catch the mineral deposits and most of all the ‚Äúbeep‚Äù is the right volume. The quality should stand up to years of use. And the blue light is a definite extra pleasure.

It‚Äôs clear glass and blue light makes it very attractive and makes it easier for me to see when it needs a cleaning.

  So far so good on this electric kettle. It doesn't take long to heat up making it very convenient. Like it being clear so I can see the contents. Love the different heat settings. The only complaint is the beep signaling that the water is ready isn't very loud and can't hear it at all if i I walk out of the room.  I drink a lot of hot tea so this fall it will really be put to the test.

    Best combo of features: variable temp + blue light
  
",5.0,Joe,"Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is my dream kettle! I absolutely love it. The variable temp allows me to use it for all the different teas I have. I used to just boil water in my old stovetop kettle, but now I can control the temperature to brew my teas properly, so they aren't overextracted and bitter.  I prefer a kettle that's clear so I can see the water bubbling. I love that the blue light turns on when the kettle heats up and that it beeps to notify me when it's done. I appreciate the Keep Warm and Auto Shutoff features for when I get distracted, especially while working from home. I've also used the kettle to heat up ""near boiling"" water for recipes when cooking. I researched hundreds of kettles online and am so glad I went with this one. 100% confident I picked the best one for me. Thanks for the great product!

  This electric kettle is the best! You can set it to whatever temperature is just right for you. Unlike most kettles it will set to the point where it is not burning you. The handle is very nice. When I saw this item I thought the controls would be in the way of holding it. Not so. It holds a lot of water.  It heats fairly quick. Not as fast as my Cuisinart. This kettle stays hot for as long as you want it to. All you have to do is hit the keep warm button and it will maintain the temperature you choose as advertised. It‚Äôs a great kettle. Kind of pricey but it‚Äôs worth it. It also automatically shuts off after I think it‚Äôs 12 hours. I drink tea all day long and I don‚Äôt have to keep heating it up and waiting. It‚Äôs always perfect temperature.

    Awesome electric kettle
  
",5.0,gsmom,"Reviewed in the United States August 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  I can't speak to its longevity since I have only owned it for about a week, but so far it has been awesome.  It looks modern and seems to be solidly built.  The lights are a nice touch when it is heating, and it holds the temperature well.  We bought this kettle because we needed one that reliably heated to the temperatures indicated on the product, and this has been true.  It has been perfect for making green tea and for making coffee in our Aeropress,  both of which require specific temperatures for best taste.  It has made a huge difference in the taste of our coffee, since we used to boil water in a traditional teapot and sort of guess on the temperature after removing from heat.  We are very happy to have chosen this kettle. Be aware that this is not a compact or small kettle; it can heat up to 8 cups of water and is fairly tall, but is nicely designed.

  ¬†This is by far the best kettle I've ever had. I love the different temperature controls, they definitely make a difference when it comes to the taste of the tea. The safety features are amazing, it turns off right after brewing, unless I press the keep warm button. And that's only one of the safety features that it comes with. It definitely heats up quick, faster than boiling on stove top. It's made from good quality materials and comes with a 3-year warranty. And it's fun to watch it brew, especially if you have young ones. I definitely recommend this product to anyone who brews at home the price is worth it.

  I love this kettle. For years I had an electric kettle that boiled water, but I drink a lot of tea, and a specialist explained how delicate teas like greens are never supposed to boil. I'd been making it wrong all that time and I can taste the difference now! There are specific settings for a few types of tea as well as a French press and boil setting. Two pushes of a button and your tailored water temp is done in a minute. Easy peasy.

  We owned a electric kettle for years but it did not have temperature control. When we needed hot water the water lukewarm at best and we have to turn it on and wait until the water heats up again. This kettle has temperature control and keeps it at the temperature you desire for atleast 4 hours.  Its an amazing feature and quality of the kettle is also top notch.

  I've used this kettle a few times now. I love everything about it! The fact that it's clear makes it easy to tell exactly how much water is inside, so you can fill only as much as you need, which in turn cuts down on boiling time. I wanted one with a variable temperature control so that I can make black tea, aeropress coffee, and yerba mate, all which require different temperatures of water. I do wish it was in Celsius rather than Fahrenheit, but that's a small concern. I'm planning to use this kettle for a long time!

It's a fantastic electric tea kettle for the price point. It heats water quickly and I love the variable temperature settings. It seems to be well constructed and feels more ""solid"" than my prior electric kettle. I did take off the removable filter on the lid, as I found it sometimes splashed water when I was pouring.

  Heats water very well and has an attractive design, but intermediate temperature settings are confusing.  When selecting a temperature like 175 F, for example, the kettle heats the water and upon reaching the temperature, continues to start and stop.  Initially we thought this was a defect, but it appears that the kettle is trying to maintain the selected temperature. However, this doesn't happen when selecting the lowest (160 F) or the maximum temperature (212 F). Overall, a nice kettle.

  I mostly like the 2.0 L capacity - most other kettles are 1.5 to 1.8 liters. I only had it for few months, so can't speak of longevity at this point. Also like the button for keeping it warm. I am not sure if the buttons for different kinds of tea are useful - that requires a connoisseur of the level I can's aspire to be - I like everything tea, but didn't know until I bought this kettle that there may be different temperatures for different types of tea. The only downside as I see at this point is the kettle a bit slow to get the water to a boiling - but I judge comparing to my previous kettle that was one of the Krupp models. Perhaps other people have different experience - it depends on how many kettles you have gone through.

This kettle works just as good as my old one, the only issue I have (and it's very minor) is that the beep that signals the kettle has reached the selected temperature is very low compared to the Cuisinart. This is only a problem if you leave the kitchen because the kettle also glows blue while heating and stops when done. Also the Cuisinart had more water level markers, but again that's not really a problem because it doesn't affect how well the product works.

  This kettle has been a great product for my needs.  The instructions are simple and straightforward. I appreciate the warming feature although I do not often find myself needing to use it.  It was important to purchase a product with a range of temperature settings and each one is adequate for the intended heating purpose.  There was a specific need for a larger kettle. This kettle is not used as an every day appliance. I would consider its use rare or less than average. Word to the wise that an electric kettle is not a shortcut to getting hot water and if you expect it to be one you will find yourself disappointed every time.  You will not get 8 cups of hot water in under thirty seconds unless you help it along with your personal heat ray or laser vision.  Please adjust expectations accordingly.

  I love that I can have hot water available for 12 hrs. The different temp settings are great as is the chart in the manual listing ALL the different teas and what temp they should be brewed at. The ready beep is NOT too loud. The blue light that cycles on and off as it is keeping the water at the right temperature is pleasing. The button to open the lid almost requires two hands, however, the only time you need to open it is when filling or cleaning. The reason for deducting a star is because today it made a buzzing sound when it was off and not hot. I lifted the pot off of the base and it stopped and has not happened again. Not sure what that was or if it will continue. Maybe I will have to unplug it when not in use? Oh, and I wish the top had less plastic. Inside the top is stainless steel but it also has plastic surrounding the stainless...not preferred but I'm not concerned enough to not use it.

  This is what we can call a product that can reach your expectations. It had it all. Safe, fast and real variety of temperature controls. We like to use it for Yerba mate and tea. We used to wait long minutes before we can start enjoying our hot beverages. Now it is an immediate pleasure with the right temperature. By the way control bottoms are accurate for what you need to get. For mate, I chose 160¬∞F and for green tea 175¬∞F. And you can chose the option to keep water at the same temperature: ideal for Yerba Mate which is a fancy ritual of kelp serving until it has no more substance. What I also appreciate is the fact that if you touch the boiler, even at its maximum heat, it doesn‚Äôt burn your hand, and this was the first reason why we bought this one.

    Good first use - pay attention to the size
  
",4.0,Cade Windell,"Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased the kettle to brew coffee for my girlfriend, and make matcha for myself. I've used it once this morning and it worked quickly. I like the simplicity of the controls, and the blue light is a nice touch. I realize now that I should have paid more attention to the size of the kettle, because my girlfriend and I only make single-serving sized drinks and the minimum amount of water you need to heat is two cups. Transferring the water to a measuring cup before pouring would drop the temperature and defeat the purpose of buying a variable temperature kettle, so I'll need to rely on my eyes and guess the right amount of water to pour. I think that it's larger than the average person might need, so keep that in consideration before buying. Besides that, I think it'll be a great product.

  I bought this electric kettle because it holds more water than most other electric kettles. I‚Äôm glad that I did! The glass lights up with a blue light to let you know it‚Äôs in the process of heating the water. When the light goes off the water is ready. So you have a visual cue to let you know the water is ready. I love that you can adjust the temperature depending on what you need to brew. There are two thoughtful things that I wasn‚Äôt expecting. The lid can be locked in place so that it doesn‚Äôt open while you pour and the spout has a built in strainer! The best part is that it heats up really quickly!

  Headline says it all - for tea, ramen, coffee, and other foods and drinks that require water in a hurry, this kettle heats up water quickly and safely and keeps it warm for those times I walk away completely forgetting about what I had started heating the water for.  Sturdy construction, good lighting to indicate the heating status - this provides everything that one can ask for in a kettle.

  I'm a huge tea and cocoa drinker nearly every cool evening for comfort, warmth, and calming.  In the past I used whistling tea kettles that rusted or the whistle broke or both.  And once the whistle broke, I wound up forgetting to get the water and burning the pot which was a fire hazard too.  So this HadinEEon Kettle purchase has exceeded my expectations!  It boils faster than a metal kettle.  It TURNS OFF after the water is done boiling OR you can set it to KEEP THE WATER WARM!  That's brilliant when you want more than one cup of tea or cocoa or if you aren't quite ready to sit down yet.  It's also great if you are hosting many people because it holds so much water.  I like the way the kettle looks and watching the water boil too!

  I bought this kettle partially to prove to my friend that Oolong tea tastes better when brewed at the correct temperature. He has probably used it more than me now, lol. I really like the kettle as well. It's very simple to use, and has buttons with temperatures for pretty much any tea you could want to drink as well as a list in the handbook with what temperature a wide variety of teas should be brewed. It heats the water very fast as well, at least twice that of my old kettle. The heating element is stainless steel which is nice since then I don't have to worry as much about it rusting. It's heavier than I expected, but not that much more than a standard coffee pot. Overall this kettle was exactly what I was looking for and I'm happy with it.

  The HadinEEon Variable Temperature Electric Kettle, 1200W Electric Tea Kettle was purchased to replace our older kettle which stopped working. It was delivered quickly and put right to use. It has much better features including different temperature range buttons on the handle which are foolproof. It allows a medium heat setting for our dog food preparation and a boiling button for hot liquids. It works very well and heats up faster than the old model. The only thing I don't like is the way the lid closes. There is a slide button on top of the lid which is new and not the easiest to operate. The older model just snapped down to close. This new button can also pinch your finger if not careful. Overall a rating of 4 stars due to this issue.

  This is our third electric kettle, and our first from this company.  Our last kettle, from a different manufacturer, lasted only a few weeks.  Our first kettle (Mueller) lasted about a year.  It was great.  This one is bigger and fancier.  Frankly, all the extra buttons are not very useful.  I know the tea connoisseurs suggest that the perfect temperature is 95 degrees centigrade, not boiling point, but really?  I like the size and handle, but the lid is imperfect.  It has a filter tongue on it that serves no useful purpose, and sometimes gets stuck when you are trying to close the lid.  And it's not that easy to snap the lid down.  It's not watertight anyway, so why make it so hard?  Finally, this kettle doesn't heat the water as fast as our original Mueller kettle, which is disappointing.  Still, so far so good.

  Looks nice, not heavy.  Metal base protects glass from contact with stone counters.  Temperature controls almost exact--green tea was 170 degrees, not 175, but close enough.  Hubby finds the blue backlight when it's turned on ""a bit over the top."" Cannot immerse, but has not needed to be cleaned yet as we only boil water in it.  I had a solid stainless steel kettle that always looked smudged and one could never easily tell how much water was in it.  Only drawback is that one cannot open the top with one hand to add water.  I must open it while it is on the counter first.  Have used for about 2 months and so far no problems.

  Great kettle except my only two quirks are:1.) The lid needs to be pushed down ‚Äúwith intent‚Äù to close properly. Not necessarily forcefully but you can‚Äôt just close it fully without thinking like other kettles; it requires an extra push to click shut.2.) It needs to be descaled more than other kettles I‚Äôve had (probably because the glass allows light in which causes mineral crystals to form faster).

  The HadinEEon Variable Temperature Electric Kettle is a very good product.  I mostly use it to heat water for tea; It heats well, and fast, and the variable temperature features allow me to heat the water to the ideal temperature for white, green, oolong, and black teas.  My only critique is the base is not as sturdy as my former kettle, the Kinden.  The controls for the Kinden were on the base (hence, leading to it being more sturdy), whereas the HaddinEEon controls are on the top of the kettle handle.  I enjoyed the Kinden, however, it stopped working after less than 2 years of use, hence, I do not recommend the Kinden (and I do not believe you can purchase as when I went searching it was not only not available from Amazon, but could not find anywhere).  Most definitely worth spending a bit more on the HadinEEon!

  I LOVE this kettle!  I had a stainless steel one before this that worked for awhile but got so gunked up and it was hard to clean.  It was also irregular with heating.  I waited to write this review (purchased in March) to see how this one would perform.  It is the BEST!  It has multiple temp settings and each one is spot on.  It is also clear so easy to see the water level and to see when it needs to be cleaned.  Cleaning is a breeze.  Can't say enough good things about this one!! You won't regret this purchase if you need a new kettle!

  The HadinEEon Electric Kettle Glass Boiler Coffee Pot, Water Heater 7 Big Cups 1.8 Liter with Quick Boil, Auto Shut Off and Boil-Dry Protection works great.  Previously heated water up in the microwave or in a teapot which was heated on the stove and used the heated water for a cup of tea or coffee, but using this kettle is easier.  Simply plug the kettle in, set the appropriate setting and within minutes the water is boiling. The large kettle size provides approximately 8 cups of water. The glass allows you to see though the kettle and watch the water bubbles come to a boil.  There are 6 settings to  use and an automatic shutoff button.  The LED blinking light shows that the kettle is still on while in the warm mode.

  I had purchased a cheaper electric kettle, but it didn't have the ""keep warm"" feature. Found it quite annoying that after the water boils, it did not stay hot. This is one of the only kettles I found with the ""keep warm"" feature, which allows me to have hot water for four hours after the water boils, and keeps it at your desirable temp (i.e., there are four pre-programmed water temps you can choose to hold your water temp at.)I am so happy with this feature; exactly what I want when all my family is together for Thanksgiving and someone is always wanting a hot drink; now even the grandkids can have hot cocoa immediately.

  The last kettle we bought started leaking after a little less than a year, so then we got this one. We have only had this one a few months so I cannot comment on the leaking issue but otherwise, I love it. There are various heat settings, they all seem to work well enough although I have not tested with a thermometer. There is an option to keep the water warm after heating which will trigger it to reheat from time to time as the water cools (I think that feature is pretty neat). Lastly, I love the blue light when the water is boiling but that is more aesthetic than anything.

The kettle get the exact temperature we want and the light functions look really nice.

  We are using this electric kettle to heat water for instant coffee and various teas, including green, black and herbal teas. The variable temperature control is great for green tea and instant coffee which do not require boiling water.  The taste of all beverages brewed so far is great, the water is in direct contact only to stainless steel and glass. There is a removable filter at the spout of the kettle which is not really needed for water, suggesting the possibility of brewing tea directly in the kettle.  I would never do this and would not recommend it as tea always leaves nasty stains.  The warranty offered suggests that the manufacturer has trust in this product.

  We drink a lot of tea and discovered that tea is meant to be brewed at certain temperatures.  It is a total game changer on the flavor of tea when it is brewed at the right temperature. Not only does it hold the temp for you for several hours it also is pretty sitting on the counter with the color of blue shining while it is busy brewing. It is a great kettle and I would say it is worth the money you spend.

  This kettle has a few annoying things with it, it does not pour very well. It always resets the temperature set after any use. It beeps when you put the kettle back and when its done boiling. It also boils like 3 times before hitting the correct temperature.On top of that they offer a free gift for a good rating, but never received the gift because every form of proof was just never good enough for them so I gave up. I would not buy this product again.Edit: I did finally get my gift thanks

    Works as intended, heat temp not completely accurate
  
",4.0,Lisa P,"Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  The kettle works as it is supposed to and heats the water, although not with accuracy. We make a lot of tea so the temperature settings are important for certain types and the temp didn't quite get to where the temperature we preselected should be. We tested this with a different temperature device. The water would heat up also but takes a long time. Overall a great kettle if you are looking for something in an average type price range.*Updated Review; the customer service of this company is great. They went out of their way to send another kettle out for us to try and offered to send us a different version as well. They work really hard to make sure the customer is happy with their purchase.

  Overall very happy with this product. I didn‚Äôt think temp control would be that important for me but this product really changed my mind on the importance of tea temp!Only complaint is that be careful if you have hard water because I did notice some slight rusting. Solved by switching to filtered water.

  When my granddaughter visited she saw me still using my old whistling stovetop kettle.  I can always rely on her to bring me up to speed with technology (she got me a smartphone too).  What a difference - this kettle heats so FAST, and has 6 different temperatures to choose from.  My water stays hot for hours!  I love the big handle (we chose this one for the handle)... and it is so easy to clean.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.

  This kettle can heat 10cups in a few minutes, or 2cups in 30 seconds! Love the 12 hr keep warm option as someone in the house is a bit of a fast beverage consumer and easily could use it consistently through the day, be it tea or cocoa or lemon waters. Hope this gives me a fighting chance to get a decent cuppa before empty!

  Overall I think this is an awesome electric kettle. I love the variable temp and the keep warm feature. The LED lights are really cool too. The only minor disappointment is that the reviews tend to talk about how quickly the kettle heats the water. The one I have is not any faster than my ten year old kettle. It took about six minutes to heat six cups to boiling. This is not a real issue for me, it is just that it is not as extraordinarily fast as I had expected from the reviews. But it is a great kettle and I would highly recommend it.

  I've been using a keurig to heat water for a while now and switching to this is like night and day. You can make a much better cup of tea if you have water that's the right temperature. The kettle doesn't take very long to heat up, which is nice. And when it's ready, the lights turn off and after a few seconds it beeps to let you know. When i bought this, I was worried the beeps would be loud and annoying. Well they're actually fairly quiet. I personally love that, but if you're hard of hearing and you expect to be leaving the room, you may want to keep that in mind. Also, the buttons on the handle are very clicky, not mushy. Just a nice little touch in my opinion. Overall, I think it's pretty great and I would recommend it.

  As of writing this review, it has been the best water boiler that I've ever used.Simply put, it combines the three things I look for in a product: design, functionality, and quality.The design, which allows one to see the water being boiled is something to marvel and appreciate. It's beautifully done and adds a little bit of happiness.The functionality, which allows one to select six different temperatures for beverage use, as well as keeping temperature. I've previously used water boilers whose only feature is an on/off switch.The quality, which allows one to appreciate using a product every single day without small minor faults occurring over time.It's a fabulous little product, and I would recommend it.

",5.0,Glenn Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States March 18, 2021","









  
  
    
  Just like many of you, I enjoy a variety of teas during the day and those teas---from green to black--should be heated at varying temperatures.  This kettle does it and with class.  Blue lights come on when you start the kettle, it gives you some gentle tones when it's done and has built in safety features to prevent boiling dry.  It has a keep warm feature that you press first, then the temperature setting and it will keep your hot water at that setting for a set time limit.  There's even a screen when you pour your water in case you made your tea in the pot, rather than in your cup.  The HadinEEon people know how to do it right!

  I asked for this kettle for Christmas because there was really nothing wrong with the one I was using except that it sounded like a plane getting ready for take off! I wish I had purchased this sooner. This kettle is so much quieter than the one I had. Every time I turned the old kettle on my husband would turn the TV up louder and since we are home during COVID there is a lot of tea drinking and TV watching and this new kettle has been wonderful in preventing raised voices. If only to talk over the kettle and TV. üòÇI also love that there are several temperature controls and even a stay warm feature. The only problem I can think of mentioning is the the kettle has to sit on the base just right or it doesn‚Äôt turn on.

  Purchased this variable temperature kettle from HadinEEon and have used it for a few days now.  It works great and looks great in my kitchen!  I love the temperature feature, it is easy to use and I can heat water without it boiling for my tea in the morning.  (No more forgetting about a pan on the stove!). The keep warm function also works well so the water is ready if I want a second cup.  It is very quiet and there are no annoying beeping noises, the blue light just goes off when the water is ready.

  We use this every day, twice a day.  It works consistently and is a lot better than using a tea kettle on the stove as we were previously.

I also change the temperature for less hot water to hydrate my dogs food. This is pretty on my counter and feels cleaner than leaving the pot on my stove all day. My daughter also drinks tea through the day and she also loves the convenience of being able to push a button for hot water. It takes very little time to heat up.

  The temperature controls are great, especially when making french press coffee. The ability to set the kettle to stay warm is perfect when having multiple cups of tea and don't want to wait for the kettle to boil. I like the clear kettle so I can easily see when the kettle needs to be treated with vinegar (have hard water). Only downside is the opening is a little smaller than my last kettle, so it not as easy to rinse out.

The size is great for tea parties and it even has a ""keep warm"" function that allows the water to stay hot. It  boils up to 8 cups (2 liters) of water.An added benefit is the design and the pretty lights when it's in use. It also does a low volume little beeping sound when it's done boiling.

  This is an excellent kettle. First I have to say it‚Äôs very pretty- the blue light shining through the water gives it a nice modern touch. Second the buttons are very smooth and easy to press. The lid, unlike other kettles, is easy to open and not awkward at all. In terms of function, it works very well. Boils water very quickly, and the multiple temperature buttons allow you to control the temperature that it reaches. It also quiet and smooth-operating, but loud enough that you can hear when it‚Äôs done boiling. I‚Äôd definitely recommend this kettle to anyone.

  Gone are the days of the stovetop kettle, where you aren't quite sure how much water is in there, it takes forever to heat up, and it dribbles out of it's spout, spilling hot water all over the place. This kettle doesnt take up much space, has different settings for different ideal temperatures, depending on what you are making the water for, and works great.I like being able to pour water into it from the kitchen sink and heat up EXACTLY how much water I need, press a button, and then done. It even keeps it warm at that temp for you if you aren't ready to use it just yet, great for having people over for brunch and you want to have hot water ready when people ask for coffee/tea. Highly recommend!

  Purchased this in April 2020 and use it daily. The two plastic clasps which lock the lid down broke. The first did about two months after purchase. We thought its not too big of a deal since it still holds down fine. Then the second broke causing the lid to open and spill when pouring. We thought ""well that's what a warranty is for"". Sadly following multiple attempts to contact HadinEEon via email, they do not respond at all. On the hunt for a new electric tea kettle.Update - while we didn't receive any feedback, we did receive a new kettle. Happy they responded as this is a good product our family uses daily.

  After just a few days we are very pleased with our purchase.  We did have to adjust the top temperature for high altitude and wished there had been a note about that in the directions.  It effected the Keep Warm function or so it seemed.  The cool blue light makes it easy to tell when the kettle is heating.  The bottom of the kettle has a nice area to wrap the cord out of sight when storing. The kettle is a little on the heavy side compared to others we have had but not unmanageable. We would recommend this kettle for someone that drinks a lot of tea or uses boiling water frequently.

  I loved my old kettle before I moved. It heated my water well and it worked reliably for the 5 years I had it.But this one might be my new favourite.The keep warm feature is AMAZING. I used to need to heat up the water AGAIN because it would always get cold. This one keeps it warm which is SUPER handy when you have an aeropress for a coffee maker, and you can only make one cup at a time.The only thing that I dislike about this kettle has really nothing to do with how good a cup of hot water you get. To close the lid, you need to pull back the tab that you used to open the lid. This isn't much of a problem, but I am lazy and with my old kettle you needed to slam it shut. So it is just something that I will get used to.Overall, very satisfied!!

  Tea anyone? I decided on this electric kettle after researching many other options. It was put to work in my office right away. I use it every day (usually several times per day). The water heats up quickly to the temperature of your choice. I use it primarily to make tea, but it could be used for anything requiring hot water. There is a setting that will keep the water warm for a set amount of time, and the unit has an automatic turn-off feature for safety. The capacity is perfect. The sounds are minimal and unobtrusive. It's easy to fill. It's aesthetically pleasing (blue lights in the base). I would highly recommend this product to others. I will be purchasing more as gifts for my colleagues.

  I make green tea every day so I wanted to invest in a plastic free, all glass and stainless steel, variable temperature electric kettle. This is the one I chose after a LOT of research. It works and looks great so far (had it for 1 day). However, the temp button or temperature sensor isn't accurate. When I click the green tea button and wait for it to finish warming and measure the temperature with a thermometer, it is only 165 degrees when it needs to be 175. 185 button only warms to 173.5 before shutting off, 190 button to 182 degrees. Not sure why. Maybe bad testing during manufacturing? It boils at 203 for me, but that's normal given that I'm at 5000 ft elevation and boiling point of water is lower here. It's not like it can go hotter than boiling. But I'm disappointed that the temperature buttons are not accurate and I'll have to remember to click the 185 button to get to the right temperature to brew my green tea (~175).

  This is an excellent choice to keep water temp at whatever you think it should be for coffee or tea. 6 buttons from 160F to 212 and a keep warm setting. It has blue LEDs to let you know it is heating or keeping warm.

  Good kettle overall. I like that I can add water to the kettle without turning the kitchen lights on, and that you can add water to the kettle while it boils, as opening the lid does not stop the kettle.

It heats up or boils the water perfectly according to the chosen temperature and it keeps it warm if you choose that option. The only thing I don't like is that the cord is quite short, so it was not easy to find a spot on my desk where the cord could reach the outlet on the wall below my desk safely without stretching the cord. However, if this kettle is placed in your kitchen counter instead of your desk, the short cord should be no problem. It is the best purchase I have made!

With the ""Keep Warm"" button, we can set it and forget it while we are making dinner, and then when we ready for some tea later in the evening, the water is already heated and ready to go.The aesthetic design is also nice enough that we just leave the kettle out on the counter when not in use, which leads to us making tea more often than we used to!Highly recommend! Wish we had purchased one sooner!

  Are you a tea lover? Do you cook rice and pasta? This tea kettle boils water quicker than a put on the stove. I love that it has different temperatures-which is nice depending on which type of tea you‚Äôre making. The fact that is glass is nice because you can watch the light reflect through the water as it boils. I did wait a few months to write this review because I wanted to make sure it worked and was worth the buy. Don‚Äôt look any further, this is the electric kettle for you!

  This electric kettle is awesome.  I love that it has preset's for different kinds of teas so that you get the maximum taste out of each.  I also enjoy the keep warm feature so that when I am done with my first cup the water is already at the right temperature waiting for use.  I just descaled it for the first time a few days ago and it was really easy to clean.  I think you can use any descaler you'd like I used Coffee machine descaler by impresa if anyone is curious, just because I wasn't sure which kind to use because there are so many.  I highly recommend this product and will more than likely be purchasing another product by HadinEEon soon.

  Bought this for my wife for Christmas, she bought me an on demand under sink hot water heater for morning coffee and Mason jars of lemon water. We decided to try the under sink heater first and found out immediately it didn't produce enough hot water for our morning demand. We started using the HadinEEon and have loved it ever since. It can heat up as much water as we need, and isn't on 24hrs/day. It only takes a few minutes to heat up 2 liters of water, where our kettle on the stove would take 15 minutes with much more energy consumption. This is the best purchase I've made on Amazon.

  I got this product as a gift for my wife. She s a tea lover and wanted a procut that would keep her water warm for long hours and also she wanted something easy to use.This is perfect. We love the light, the capacity, how quickly it works. The keep warm option is great. The kettle is easy to use, lightweight and super practical due to the rotation system. Definitely worth the price in comparison to other products. It has lots of features that make it a great electric kettle.

  Bought this last October 2019. It's July 2020 now. Ok while it lasted. Did what it had to do. It was a little annoying to always have to scrub off the white stuff on the bottom after it dried but other than that it was working perfectly fine. Today, I guess it ran out of use? The back handle sparked then exploded. Not sure what that was about.

  I had a Cuisinart Kettle for years, and when it finally died, I bought this as a replacement.  I needed some of the same features:  ability to choose my temperature, able to maintain a temperature and something that looked nice in the kitchen.  I was a bit skeptical about whether or not I'd like the lights - but I do.  Also, I prefer the clear glass to the old stainless steel because now I can see the water and its progression.  I've been using it multiple times per day for a few months now and I haven't had any issues with this kettle.  In fact, I've decided that I like it better than my old kettle, which cost more money.  I highly recommend it!

I really enjoy having the multiple temperature settings, the safe heating element, easy to decipher measuring components and the warming setting so I can have two cups throughout the afternoon.

  My wife and I love to drink warm water-based beverages, so this kettle was perfect for our daily needs! It's beautiful and easy-to-use. We continue to use it every day (sometimes multiple times a day) since December. The only thing is that it can accumulate minerals at the bottom of the kettle from the water, which you then should clean as it makes the boiling process sound ""rocky"" (which makes my wife and I slightly scared that it'll one day crack the glass).  If your water isn't mineral-y, you shouldn't have this problem. It's just a slight inconvenience for us due to our water type.

No need for a coffee pot on the counter- this kettle and my french press make way better coffee. With 6 temperature settings it makes perfect tea every time, plus has a feature to keep it warm. The cord keeper is great. I do have to descale hard water if I don't always use bottled water, but that's easy to do. The lights and audio cues make it easy to know when water's ready or program is changing. Highly recommend this product.

    An Easy-to-Use Kettle
  
",5.0,Texas Teacher,"Reviewed in the United States June 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this pot over a year ago, and have used it since.  It still works great, heats and then holds the heat, and makes life easier when it comes to making tea, French press coffee, or Vietnamese coffee.  Using a little cream of tartar occasionally keeps it free from scaly build-up from hard water.  Just a good product.

  This kettle is simply the best one that I'd ever owned.First, it holds a massive 2 L of water whereas most of the other kettles out there hold 1.7 L.Second, it heats the water quickly with an option to choose the best temperature for the type of tea that I'm brewing.Third, and best of all it has a keep warm setting so I can go back and make a 2nd cup of tea without having to wait for the water to heat up. I like this kettle so much I've been thinking of ordering a second just to have a spare.

  This kettle works exactly as advertised.  It feels durable and well made. The lid stays in place when opened all the way, making it easy to fill with water, and the latch feels secure when closed. The buttons make it convenient to quickly select a temperature, and the keep warm function is great for making multiple cups of tea. I also purchased a stainless steel coffee filter to use with this kettle and have completely replaced my Keurig with this setup. If you enjoy tea, coffee, and not filling land fills with plastic K-Cups, this kettle is for you.

  This kettle is wonderful. The choices of what temperature to make for tea are very handy. I drink tea all day, and like steeping it at the proper temperature. I worked at Starbucks for years, and having the chance to make tea or coffee properly at home is great! There is also a feature where you can keep the water hot for hours. This is convenient for when I am home in the evenings and want multiple cups of tea. No waiting for it to boil again.I highly recommend this kettle.

  This kettle works well and consistently keeps water at the right temp. It's easy to clean, and even comes with a cleaning packet for the first time you want to descale it. It does take a little bit of time to heat up the water, but that's because it gradually increases to your desired temperatures. Sometimes the middle temps take the longest as it is switching on and off to make sure it doesn't bring the water up too quickly / hot. Solid, dependable.

  This is the 5th electric kettle we have owned. The first units were good products, but never lasted more than 2 years each. The next 2 were less expensive options, but were only OK. This kettle is really cool with the glass body and LED light show. So far (4 months) the kettle has worked flawlessly. I do have one issue which doesn't detract from the operation of the kettle, but is most inconvenient. The lid doesn't close fully unless you forcefully close it. All the other kettles we've owned have easy opening and closing. When you go to pour the water out, if the lid isn't closed completely, the water dribbles everywhere.

  I was a bit hesitant to order a brand I had not heard much about, but this kettle arrived quickly and it gets the job done!  I drink many different types of tea throughout the day, and the various temperature settings make each pot just right.  And major plus, it looks really cool when it's on with the blue LEDs surrounding the bottom of the kettle.My only complaint would be that it sometimes takes some time before it shuts off when the water reaches a boil.  I think it may be because I live at altitude and water boils at a lower temperature.

  We got this kettle for use in our office. Everyone enjoys!Feature-wise, the only suggestion would be for the kettle to remember the heat setting when you pick it up from the base. For example, when you are preparing pour-over coffee and need to return the kettle to the base several times as the water filters through the grounds, it is a minor inconvenience to have to confirm the heat selection each time. We would prefer that you would have to press a button to change or stop the last setting used.However, this is a small inconvenience and we still give the product a 5 star rating without hesitation!

We also loved the temperature choices as my husband is a coffee connoisseur who is now making his own ""pour over"" coffee.  Plus we have tea drinkers in the house.  Having specific temperatures for different teas allows us to enjoy the best of both the tea and coffee worlds.  The design is very functional and the blue light around the glass makes it nice to watch.  Additionally we like the ""keep warm"" feature because sometimes I boil water for one thing, and the remaining water can be used a little later for something else and still be kept warm.

  We've owned a number of cheap and expensive kettles and this one is definitely one of the better ones as far as the ""value/price"" ration is concerned.  While it is not the fastest kettle, it gets the job done relatively quickly and has just the right number of options and features (unlike the more expensive products that have a number of features that an average person would never utilize).  The kettle is sturdy and, being made of glass, does not have the residue you sometimes see in metal kettles.

  When I moved in with my boyfriend I was leaving behind an electric kettle I shared with roommates that I grew to love. While I was doing lots of research for a new one this one stood out the most because of the temperature control and how slick it looks. I love drinking tea, but also a big fan of french press coffee so a specific temperature control for french press is really helpful. My only wish is that the top wasn't so clunky to pop open or make sure it's closed a few times it's not shut and I've caught it before it could pour more severely hot water everywhere.

  Having been accustomed to heating water in a stove top kettle, I wasn't sure how an electric kettle would compare.  Since it's initial use, this kettle has become the most used kitchen appliance we have. The wireless carafe is a definite plus for ease of filling and use.  My kids and I use it multiple times a day.  As a family we use it for heating water for tea, oatmeal, hot chocolate and soup. The LED lighting is a fun feature and the clear carafe allows a great view of where the water is in the heating cycle. the only drawback is the short timer on the keep warm function.  Overall, we are very happy with this purchase.

  I've been researching for the best temperature control kettle, and after using this one for a week,  I do believe I've found it. I'm both an avid tea and coffee drinker. Whether I'm brewing some delicious french press coffee or making a cup of tea - this kettle rocks. It's perfect for every kind of tea drinker as well, with temperature settings for white, green, oolong, and black tea. Makes a delicious cup of coffee/tea, and looks incredibly stylish while doing so. Cannot recommend enough.

  Great little kettle and a real steal for the price! We love the temp control and blue light. It sounds silly, but the light actually really helps us know when it's on, when it's done, and what it's doing.No joke, the first few times we used it, we were expecting it to take longer to get to temp. We'd sit there and wait long enough that the way function would kick on!My ONLY complaint is that I wish the cord was a bit longer. It feels a tad short.

  I use this to heat water for baby bottle and use while cooking. Although it is advertised as heating up the water quickly, I don‚Äôt think that it is quicker than any old kettle. I still have to wait several minutes for water to boil. I like the blue light and glass. But the glass also makes the kettle heavier to carry which is hard for my mother who has arthritis. It doesn‚Äôt get Lyme in it as fast as other kettles but I recommend soaking in 1 part vinegar and 1 part water once per week to prevent buildup.

  This is my first electric kettle and I've had it for a few months. I'm trying to get into the habit of drinking more tea and this has worked as advertised so far. The water heats up quick and the blue signal lights are pleasant on the eye. I also appreciate the sound to let me know when the water is ready. The temperature controls help to determine what temperature the water should be depending on the type of tea, and lists this on the buttons on the device, making tea brewing a snap. The top part opens pretty wide so cleaning the inside is no problem.

  I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband based on our daughter's good experience.  The supplier was quick to replace the cracked pot under the tree, and my husband has been using it daily since.  It boils 2 cups of water in 3 minutes and reduced the chance of him scalding himself when he boiled water in the microwave.  The blue lights around the base of the pot amuse him - little boys and their toys.  Possible downside -  temperature settings below 200¬∞F are maybe 5¬∞ off based on a check with thermocouple  (160¬∞F setting warms to 155¬∞F).  All in all very satisfied.

  Sipping on the first cup of coffee I've made with it as I type this and so far so good! I appreciate the ability to set temperature and walk away. In a few minutes I was able to boil up 4 cups of water to 200F and the difference in flavor between my few attempts to do the same on stovetop or in the microwave is immediately obvious. Being able to keep the water at target temperature for a while is something I'll be getting a lot of use out of as well.It's total fluff but I like the blue LEDs (picture related).

  It is a pretty kettle and works as advertised. Really like the feature of variable temperature control. You can brew teas using different temperature combinations based on types of teas. I typically use the lowest setting (around 70C ) for a quick tea wash to get rid of any contaminations or chemicals.  I  then brew the tea at higher setting and also hit Keep Warm button. The kettle is nicely designed to keep the tea warm-ready for the whole day.  The price is high though compared with similar products. However, it comes with a 3 year warranty, not just one year for others.

  Great product that heats relatively quickly and looks pretty while doing it. I was apprehensive about getting a water heater that has specific temperature buttons, but its actually been a really nice feature to have for us. We like to drink green tea, black tea, pour over coffee, and hot chocolate. This makes it easy to pick temps for all those different beverages. I would reccomend this to a family member or friend for sure.Also love the cord, that you can coil it up under the machine base to make it shorter or longer.

The kettle heats up super quickly, and I love the blue light that turns on while it's heating. I love the variations in temperature settings they're perfect because not only can you choose your preferred temperature, but you can make your water extra hot to add into your lukewarm tea to warm it up again.

  The kettle is great except in two respects.  Firstly, the scale build-up on the inside metal bottom is almost instantaneous and needs to be cleaned every few days using vinegar or lemon juice combined with water.  Secondly, the beeps made by the kettle when boiling are too low to hear if you are in the other room.  Otherwise, I love the way the kettle looks with the blue lights when it's boiling and the ""keep warm"" feature which maintains a pre-specified temperature.

  This is a great kettle. It looks great, has very nice soft blue lighting, and has the perfect set of temperature controls for any tea you might want to brew.

  The kettle is easy to use and it heats up well. I bought this ""upgraded"" version because of the ""keep warm"" features, but in order to keep warm, the water constantly re-boil every here and there, which doesn't feel safe for me to leave it in the kitchen by itself, and also seems like a waste of electricity. The bottom also peels a little after couple weeks of use, but this happened to our previous electric kettle, and even with the new Zojirushi thermos bottle we have, so I am not sure if it's because of our water. Overall, it works so we will keep it till it dies.

  I love this kettle! It is super easy to operate and it works perfectly for me. I had been searching for a temperature controlled kettle for a while but I was turned away by the prices. Then I found this one and I'm so happy! The price is awesome compared to other kettles I saw and it works great! It does not have the ability to set exact temperatures yourself, but for me, the preset options are all I need. This had made drinking tea so much better for me. It is also super easy to clean. I'm so happy with this purchase!

  I bought this kettle because it has different temperature settings.  I have always heated the water to boiling and steeped the tea.  Different temperatures truly make a better tea consumption experience especially for delicate white teas.  The lid does not come off but it does hinge open wide enough for me to clean the interior with a sponge.  I like that this kettle has a keep warm mode.  The water heats up much faster than boiling on stove or using microwave.  I am very happy with this purchase.

",4.0,Stephanie V,"Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  This electric tea kettle works pretty well and I would recommend it overall. I honestly preferred the Cuisinart CPK-17AMZ Perfect Temp Cordless Programmable Kettle, Stainless Steel, because it did a much better job of keeping the water warm for a longer period of time, but it was unavailable when it came time to replace it. The HaddinEEon has held-up pretty well so far. I like that it boils the water quickly and that you can see it's status while it's heating (glass). It's a decent product that does what it is supposed to do.

  This kettle is great for someone who needs to refill a hot mug in between clients, but doesn‚Äôt have time to keep reheating the water. Just be sure to use new water every day and clean it by boiling half vinegar and half water at least once a month, if not more. If you don‚Äôt do those things, you‚Äôll get bits of minerals floating around that look like glass shards. Not sure if they‚Äôre harmful or not, but to be safe, when I see them, that‚Äôs when I know it‚Äôs time to clean the pot.

  I am a tea drinker, 5-6 times a day and different types of tea, which require different temperatures for brewing. I chose this kettle for its function of the temperature control and it is working great for my needs. It is a sturdy and good looking kettle. Water boils quickly and the sound of beep is quiet but noticeable. Another thing I like about it is once you use up the boiled water the bottom dries up quickly and doesn‚Äôt leave any residual marks. I have a different brand kettle I use at work and I‚Äôve been having a hard time removing the white caking marks. I waited a month before I write this review to see if it happens, so far I didn‚Äôt find any of those. The only downside is the mouth of the kettle is little smaller than my hand can fit comfortably, so I need a brush to clean it. Other than that so far so good.

  This is a very high-quality kettle with great features, especially the keep-warm function, which is why I purchased this particular kettle.  It takes a while to heat up the water (15-20 minutes to 200 degrees), but then it keeps it warm for up to 12 hours if you choose that setting.  I drink hot tea all day long so it's my favorite feature; however, it sometimes shuts off even when I have the keep-warm feature selected.  Not a deal breaker, but a little irritating.

  The stay warm option remains working even after taking the kettle off the base element, so it will keep heating unless you turn it off manually by pushing the button.

It's strange that the heating goes on and off throughout the heating process, but it's explained well in product's directions and is a normal function of the kettle.

  I like it has buttons designated of different types of tea, such as Green Tea, Oolong, Black Tea, Delicates, French Press.It does take a little bit longer (about 3 minutes) to fully heat up for Black Tea. I drink mostly black tea. Just heat it up and do other things and soon the water is boiling and ready. I like that it has a blue light that lights up and a autoshut off for safety. You can easily clean it by pouring white vinegar and water and heat it to boil, then dump the water...shining inside and clean. Very easy to use. Highly recommend.

    Does what it says
  
",4.0,Andrew Macheret,"Reviewed in the United States September 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  This product is as expected. Heats water fast, keeps warm, looks neat with the blue light. My only minor complaint is the pour spout shape. The water pours directly down, rather than any sort of 'arc' some spouts create. I feel like this creates more need to tip the pot closer to a full 90 degrees when pouring, which is more likely to put your hand in line of the steam coming up and potentially get burned. (Neither of us have gotten burned yet, so that says something..but I'd prefer a better pour spout.)

  Given the variety of teas I like, this is definitely an improvement. I used to use just whatever electric kettle was cheapest, but that also meant there was zero temperature control and the taste was affected due to a combination of scalding certain teas and having the taste impacted by the fact the kettle itself was entirely plastic, and a much bigger pain in the neck to clean.The lid on this one opens wide enough it's easy to clean inside, and the fact that the kettle itself is largely class means it's easy to avoid over-filling.

  This is the better of the two variable temperature tea kettles we have owned.  It does not override the lower temperatures like our previous one did, because it pulses the heat element toward the end of the heating cycle, so it sort of eases into the right temp.  The glass is nice to make the state of boiling easily visible.

",5.0,Eileen M. Rutherford,"Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  This electric kettle is a great buy! The clear design allows you to easily see how much water you're adding and to confirm that it's boiling properly. I like the levels of temperature you can select from, and really like the secure base that automatically identifies when the kettle is placed on top. It shuts off quickly after boiling point is reached. Glad I bought it!

  I love this kettle!! I had purchased a different brand previously, but at 1500 watts it was popping my circuit constantly. I recently started drinking pour over coffee and wanted a kettle with options for temp settings. This pot is 1200 watts with options( and tea/ coffee temp settings) for keep warm.This kettle is perfect!! It quickly heats the water to the perfect temperature and keeps it at the temp while I repeatedly use small amounts of water to make my coffee! The beautiful glowing blue light is a nice touch, too!

  I love, love, love this kettle! I recently discovered the world of loose-leaf teas and knew I had to get an electric kettle to heat the water. Once I saw this particular model, I was hooked! I love that you can specify the optimum temperature you want your water at, depending on the type of tea you're brewing. The kettle heats up quickly, even to boiling. The blue lights are also a cool feature. I use my kettle daily and couldn't be happier with this model!

  This kettle was exactly what I was looking for- sleek for having on the counter without taking up too much space. It heats up the water perfectly and I love that it has different temperature options and the ability to keep the water warm for a time. I was previously using my coffee maker to get hot water and no matter how many times I cleaned it it would always taste of coffee grounds- this has made such a huge difference and as a result I can't stop buying new teas to try!

",5.0,Brian F.,"Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2021","









  
  
    
  Had this for three months now and used it at least twice per day. Heats quickly, holds temperature on keep warm setting, presets are on +/- 3 or so degrees of actual temp (measured with digital thermometer). Using filtered tap water I've not had any issues with deposits, rust or scaling - I leave the lid open after boiling and wash once per week. Only issue is the lid latch is a bit finicky which is an issue if you boil a large amount of water.Best feature is the large top opening - easy to wash. Recommend 100%

  I'm addicted to tea!  Have been all my life but always was annoyed that it took so long because the water needed to boil before brewing could begin.  With the HadinEEon Kettle, the water is ready when you are!  Plus I love that it keeps the water the right temperature for whatever tea I'm in the mood for (i.e., white, green, black, etc.).  The water temperature DOES make a difference!.  This kettle is well worth the price plus it is easy to clean and beautiful on the counter.  Highly recommend!

  I bought the HadinEEon to replace a Cuisinart electric kettle that worked great for several years then stopped working. The Cuisinart was much more expensive and harder to clean. I like the looks of the Hadin and so far it works great. I don't know how exact the temperature options are (which is why I only gave it 4 stars for temp control) but there is a difference between 200 degrees (for coffee) and boil.  I've been using it for several months and I highly recommend it.

  I have to say this kettle is legit. I make coffee and tea constantly and being able to fail in the heat is perfect. It's incredibly fast as well. I like my coffee hotter than what Keurig can produce and the time difference is minimal. The blue lighting subtle enough and it looks sleek enough to.leave out on the counter. Only small critique is the beep to alert you to the water being ready is very soft. I'm sure if it was loud I'd probably say it's too loud. This was money well spent.

  I have put my faith into HadinEEon creation and they didn't let me down. I really like the design, its very easy to see how much water is left instead of opening top and measuring by an eye. It boils relatively fast and provides variable temperature settings that is a Must for tea and coffee connoisseurs. I am enjoying it and hoping it will last me as long as my previous one over 7 years!

  Recently purchased an electric kettle to replace our gas kettle. First attempt we picked up a cheap kettle from Costco that failed within a month (poor electronics maybe?). This kettle in comparison feel substantially more well made, offers better heat control, and boils more rapidly. Certainly worth the few extra bucks for the quality of assembly. The settings for tea are really nice if you brew a lot of different types of teas! The automated boiling cut off it really nice too and seems to work very well.

  We bought the glass model. Overall, we are quite pleased with it. However, there are a couple of things to be aware of. The most dangerous is the lid. It is hard to close. Several times I came close to being burned by the steam before I learned it had to be decisively pushed to close it. The other problem is the small size of the temperature selection buttons. It is difficult to select the center buttons. Once those problems are overcome, the kettle is quite satisfactory.

  A few months ago, I decided to spoil myself and get an electrical kettle that has a sharp look and is versatile. When it finally arrived, it fulfilled all my expectations. I am an artist and, visually, this kettle pleases my sight tremendously. The indigo lights and the bubbles as the water are very enchanting to the eye. Also, I found this item very user friendly with several easy options. I use mine many times a day, and it has become a friend during these social distancing times!!!!:)

  I chose this kettle primarily for the temperature control, and boy that it make a difference. It opened me up to a whole new world of I never knew existed. Everything else is also good about the product with one quibble. My previous kettle's button for opening the led was within a thumb's reach of the handle. With this you have to use your other hand. Not a big deal, but something they might think about changing in future versions.

Used to have an all stainless steel one, but the glass is a much better look. The wide mouth also makes it much easier to clean. For descaling, I just use powdered citric acid once in a while. Works like a charm!

  We were warned that the writing on the buttons wears off over time and we're still concerned because we use some buttons more than others (i.e we use ""french press"" and ""black"" more often than ""Oolong"" or ""Green"" ).  However, we appreciate being able to watch the water heat up through the all glass display, and it's neat how if we don't immediately pull the kettle off the plate, the plate will continue heating to ensure the water is at the indicated temperature we wanted.

  This kettle has been great for our family. The different temperature settings have been very helpful, as we all drink different types of tea, along with coffee, that is brewed at different temperatures. The kettle is super easy to use, as the controls are very intuitive. It also has a nice indicator for when the water is to the desired temperature, a few beeps that are loud enough to get your attention, but not obnoxious. We use it every day!

  As far as kettles in the US go, it's a decent one. The lid does feel flimsy like it may break off at any point. To be clear it hasn't, but I get the feeling it will sooner rather than later. Other than that, worthwhile features are the different temp types and the pretty blue light. All in all it's pretty good!

  The kettle works very well. It is visually appealing, and cleans easily. The ""keep warm"" setting requires that the kettle be on its base longer than just the time needed to heat it, but it does a good job maintaining once it enters that state. You do, however, have to remember that if you remove the kettle from the base before it enters the ""keep warm"" state that you have to restart it to get it to go into that desired mode.

  So I'm very particular about my teas as I switch over to tea after the morning latte and drink all day.I brew loose leaf and care about the temperature.This kettle gives several temperature options and boils quickly.I like the glass case as it's clean, holds alot of water, and pours cleanly.I've had this kettle for 7 months now and am still very pleased.

  I'm an avid tea drinker and needed a kettle with various temperature settings. This kettle does a perfect job of heating the water to the right temp for my different teas. It's easy to use. I love the automatic shutoff since I tend to get distracted by my kiddos sometimes. I highly recommend this if you are in the market for an electric kettle.

  I gave my sister my old tea kettle because I wanted a temperature controlled one. this one does not let me know when it is done. the clear kettle does not light up while brewing like my old one. I have to keep resetting if I've walked away because it turns off. I will eventually give my sister this one too and buy a different one or take my old one back. Otherwise it works. But need to really eat ch it to see if it is done brewing.

  This product does everything it says it will. Heats up fast, easy lift, pour, and fill, and it provides a cleaning solution for build up. There are setting for the type of tea you are making. I always drink black tea which is the hottest setting so if you prefer green or oolong it will be finished heating even faster. It will keep warm all day if there is enough water in it to do so. Love it!!

  This kettle is so great for someone like me that is super busy in the mornings. It's so great to set the temperature for my coffee or tea and use the ""Keep warms"" button to make sure that it doesn't get cold if I forget to pour the coffee or tea (which I do all the time). It boils water so fast and it super easy to clean with a little white vinegar and water.

  This is a great electric kettle.  I love the different temperature settings for different purposes or types of tea.  It's built well and it's very sturdy, but not too heavy.

  It's a very sharp looking, easy to use electric kettle. It seems to do everything it promises. My one complaint is there is no thermometer readout to verify that the water is in fact the desired temperature. You just have to trust the kettle's internal thermometer. I'd like to have that added assurance, both for use, and also for safety. For example, if you leave boiling water to cool it would be nice to know how hot the water is as it cools down.

I like my tea in between warm/hot so I use to green tea setting and my husband loves his tea piping hot so he uses the French press setting. it's reasonable and works just as great as the high end ones.

  I really like this kettle. It's great that you can set different temperatures for different beverages, even though I rarely do that. My husband and I couldn't figure out why it wasn't turning off once it was boiling, but it's the altitude, not the kettle. I use this daily, multiple times a day. I empty it at night and leave the lid open to let it air out. It's worth the counter space!

I bought this electric kettle on a whim before the tea party and oh boy, did it do the job! I love that it has different temperature settings for black, green, oolong, and other teas.

  I'm mainly comparing this kettle to the Cuisinart kettle.  This kettle is much prettier than the Cuisinart kettle.  It also holds more water.  However it pours worse.  This kettle seemed to dribble a lot more than the Cuisinart.  It also did not beep as loudly or consistently.  Sometimes it didn't seem like it beeped at all.  Ultimately we returned this one and bought the Cuisinart kettle.  But this one is definitely prettier.

Only issue is, it is a little hard to get the hand inside to clean.  But I have big hands so, maybe that‚Äôll work for you!  Definitely worth a try! Do it!

",5.0,Agustin Sponton,"Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  I am a mate üßâ drinker (Southamerican drink) and I‚Äôve been drinking at least a thermo (2 Liters) a day since I got this kettle a month. It just takes a couple of minutes to heat the water to my desired temperature (175 F ) and there are no stains on the bottom despite I don‚Äôt clean the bubbles after pouring the water on my thermo. It sounds a short beep when it gets to the selected temperature and I am really happy with my purchase

  It might seem frivolous to buy a fancy lighted water kettle, but I absolutely love it and I would buy it again. Working from home and drinking tea all day makes the 4 hour 'keep warm' function an essential. And as silly as it sounds, having the blue light shining through the water on my counter top makes it more attractive than my kerrig was.

  Only two minor complaints. When set to full boil it does not cutoff when it reaches a full rolling boil.  it will continue to boil for 1-2 minutes before it finally turns off. When you put the kettle back on its base the 'on' goes on and then goes off a few seconds later. If you want to start the kettle you have to wait for the light to go off or hit the button twice.

Biggest complaint is that it was a little expensive for what it is.The customer support was great through, and I updated to 5 stars after they were about to credit be a portion of the cost!

  I initially bought this kettle to make tea, but with its large capacity I started to use it as an easy way to get hot water while cooking (for making stock, soups, etc). The kettle heats up fast (just a few min for making 2 cups for tea) and I really like the keep warm function. It's easy to use-all the temperatures you can heat to are clearly labeled on the buttons.

I really like the Keep Warm feature, too - it saves time since I don't have to reheat the water each time.  My only (minor) complaint is the lid release isn't nearly as convenient as my last kettle - I could reach the release with my thumb when I was holding it on my old one.  That may be a safety feature, though, now that I think about it.  I just have to get used to it.  Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase, and the blue light is very cool.

I decided to buy an electric kettle and was drawn to the variety of temperatures that could be chosen with this model allowing you to get the best from different teas we drink.  It's a wonderful product.  I much prefer using this kettle to a microwave.  I especially like the keep warm options.  You won't be disappointed with this kettle.

  Went through 2 or 3 typical whistling stovetop kettles that rusted after 1 year. Decided to try an electric kettle with temperature control. I love this kettle! It boils quickly. The only thing is the finished boiling beeping could be much louder. Unless it is dead quiet, you can barely hear the beeps. I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an electric kettle.

What I like best about this water cooker is that I don't burn my fingers while pouring. Many cookers release steam which can burn your fingers when hold in a different position.

  I got this for my grandma. She likes that it lights up and she knows what the temperature reading is. She also has long nails so the actual, tactile buttons are great for her. We've had kettles with flush buttons rather than protruding ones and this is easier for her to use. It's a clean design, easy to use, easy to clean, and maintain. Really can't ask for more!

I also really like the variable temperature feature, which makes it easy to control the temperature of the water depending on what you're using it for.

  This is my first water boiler; I used a microwave before this. Seems sturdy and well made. Quick way to get boiled water than microwave. Will hold up to 2 liters. Buttons make it easy to choose the right temperature quickly. Has a built in filter which is nice. The top does not come off, but I was able to squeeze my hand inside to wash it before the first use. Not to miss 3 years warranty.

  I shopped around for a few months and finally decided to purchase this kettle based on its customer reviews. I was so impressed with the kettle that I ended up purchasing a second one for my second home. There are multiple heat settings including a keep warm function. It heats water quickly and does not have any odor which was a problem I ran into with other brands.

  I tested each of the temperature settings by using 3 different thermometers and the largest variance was 4 degrees lower than the 160 degree setting.  At the 190 degree setting, the actual temperature i measured as 192 degrees.  Overall, I am very pleased with the electric kettle and it's ability to produce temperatures close to the settings on the kettle

  I use this kettle at home and it's a godsend. The different temperature options are awesome at ensuring my teas don't burn, and come out tasting as they should. Heating time is very fast and it beeps 3 times gently to let you know it's finished. It's also convenient being able to take it off the base and bring it anywhere, so you're not confined to wherever it's plugged in. There's also a blue light at the base so it looks cute.

  I am a novice tea drinker, but getting more and more into the different specialities. I never knew certain tea had a temperature requirement to get the best out of the tea. I found this tea kettle and have been pleasantly surprised at how fast this heats water and keeps it warm. Far more superior than my old stove tea kettle.

  I used to boil water over a stove for a cup of hot water, this kettle heats up 8 cups of water very quickly by comparison, and auto turns off, or transitions to the keep warm function.

  This product looks great in my kitchen! It boiled 8 cups of water on the highest temp 212F in less than 7mins which is really fast. I normally don't need to boil that many cups which makes it even faster to get boiling water. I also really like the keep warm feature. The lid pops up and stays open even when you're pouring which makes your life easier. Other pots I've had you needed two hands to pour.

  This kettle has all the functions built into buttons, really easy to use and boils water pretty fast, I would say, at least when water is half-filled (we rarely boil a full kettle of water).

Be careful just in case.

  I like the  Variable Electric Kettle. I drink green tea so I like the preset to get the right temperature for my tea. It is easy to fill and easy to clean. However I have discover that the preset temperatures are lower than what the preset says. They are off by 5 to 7 degrees.

  This product is great. It doesn‚Äôt take that long to have hot water ready and the Keep Warm feature is so convenient. I can have hot drink whenever I want.Just a suggestion, it would be best if the lid itself comes off so it‚Äôs easier to clean the unit other than that it‚Äôs awesome and worth the buy.

  This kettle is a game changer for me. I‚Äôve never had a better cup of green tea and the keep warm feature saves my ADD brain countless times a day from forgetting about the water.The build is really solid and heats the water quickly. The blue led lights are also a nice touch.5/5 would absolutely recommend to anyone who enjoys a good cup of tea.

  This is my first water boiler; I used a microwave before this. This kettle is well made. Boiled water for my coffee in a short period of time and keeps in at the same temperature for hours. Buttons make it easy to choose the right temperature quickly. Has a built in filter which is nice. I would highly recommend this product.

  Great tea kettle! My favorite part is the stay warm option so if you forgot about your hot water it will still be there ready to go. I also like the temp control although I mostly use the hottest. However it does take longer to heat up than ones I‚Äôve had in the past and the cord for the base is a bit too short.

  I ordered the HadinEEon Variable Temperature Electric Kettle to boil water for my french press coffee and tea in the mornings.  It heats up the water quickly and keeps it warm while I get ready for work in the morning.  It is easy to clean, but the opening is narrow.

  Not completely temperature variable but close enough not to be a hindrance (160, 175, 185, 190, 200, 212).  Finish alarm is very low volume and easy to miss; try using ""maintain temp"" button and it will hold temp until you are ready.  Otherwise, very satisfied.

Its also affordable so thats one big plus alone. Excellent product. So definitely get this. Why manually boil when you save yourself the heat and time with this? Definitely recommend this.

  We bought this a couple months ago since we needed a new kettle. Decided to give it a try and have not been disappointed. It gets up to temperature and maintains it for quite a while. Only thing I would suggest is a little bit louder of a chime when it gets up to temperature.

  From a self acknowledged tea snob, this is great for tea. Temperature does make a difference. Only complaint is that the ending beeps are not louder. Without hearing  aids,  you can‚Äôt hear it; with them, you can barely here it. The keep warm function helps to mitigate the problem. My husband likes the French Press setting.

  I used to have to boil water in a pot on the stove and it was a little inconvenient. Now having the electric kettle, it makes it much easier to boil water and I don‚Äôt have to keep cleaning a pot just for water. The electric kettle is safe and easy to use, heats up water fast, and keeps it at the temperature you set it to.

  This electric kettle has every feature I wanted. Glass body, accurate temperature settings using distinct water temperature sensor instead of heater plate sensor, processor controlled operation, ergonomic and, as a bonus, good looks too. I am very satisfied so far.

  The temperatures seem different enough, nice to have the option for 'not as hot' even if you aren't a tea fan. There was some confusion of pressing which temp you want then start, but once we figured it out it's easy. The base is hollow not like the others we had in the past, seems to be working well going on three weeks now.

  I purchased this kettle as a gift for my husband and we both agree this is incredible.  Aside from the aesthetics (which are impressive) what we really like is the various boiling temperatures and the 4 hour keep warm feature.  So glad we found this particular unit it.

  We had a minute pot for over ten years, a stalwart lil white plastic number that did my tea for years. My wife just got me this one and NOW and can boil enough water for an entire pot of pasta, and it has multiple temperture settings for green to black tea. We love it!

  Overall I am very happy with the kettle.  The only issue, and it may be operator fault, it does not seem to maintain the warm setting as long as I would like.  Getting the temperature right makes for a better cup of tea or coffee and that it does well!!
