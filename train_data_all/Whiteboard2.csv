    Cheep and fell of wall in a few days and could not be rehung

  I put this on the very smooth wall, it fell off the wall a few days later and stick on Velcro was ruined so no way to rehang this. It's also slightly warped as I did add some strong magnets to back of it , the week in it won't let it lay flat enough to stick to the fridge. Very disappointed in this product.

  It's the perfect size for what i needed - just keeping some notes about some studio projects.  The back is cardboard, so not the highest quality, but was appropriate for the price.  The first board arrived damaged (dent from having something dropped on it) but Amazon replaced it quickly and all is well.

  I use this for doing math, chemistry, and biology problems without going through a bunch of paper. It is the perfect size for working out most problems without having to erase for space. I bought Expo dry-erase markers, cleaner, and an eraser to use with this.Pros:- Easy to clean; does not stain if you use better markers (I suggest not using the one it comes with)- Easy to hang (although I chose not to)- Does not show any signs of falling apart or breakingCons:- If you use the attached marker and eraser, it does tend to get a bit cloudy looking and stained, so you would have to clean it with water more often.

  Overall it’s a okay little marker board. When I got it, it was all dented up and there was two what looked to be like deep scratches to the point, you could see the sliver. This was definitely not for shipping. If I had time to wait around for another one I would have requested another one, but seeing how this one was late to beginning with, I would rather just not deal with the hassle.

  For the price I can't gripe too much, but it does not have hanger options, only velcro, so you are limited as the where you can put it.It is okay for sticking (via velcro)on the refrigerator, but...It should have a loop at the top and side to hang it on a nail, and a fold out leg stand like some table top picture frames have.  After all, what do they think we're going to do with it?  Fridge only?

  I'm really disappointed in the consistency with this white board. I bought 2 of these for our in home classroom. One is great. It comes clean nicely, no matter how long the marker writing stays on the board.The other one, however, will not come clean no matter how much elbow grease I put into it. With soap and water, and lots of pressure, I can eventually get it somewhat clean. But you can still see the remains of the previous writing.I'm so frustrated with this.

I used many different colors of dry erase markers on this board also and when erasing none of the color lingered behind like how it does sometimes (even with red, dark blue, and green).

  Title of the product misleading. I was looking for a dry erase board that could magnetically attach to my metal door and 'magnetic dry erase board' I though would fit my needs. If you read the last paragraph in the description you see what it means is that it comes with just a small magnet for you to attach notes to the dry erase... It's a dry erase board, write the note on the board... The board itself actually uses small velcro patches to attach to whatever..

  Had to return this item because the very first use show it to be defective and of very poor quality. I used Expo dry-erase markers on the board just after it arrived. When I went to erase the board with a dry paper towel, the marks would only erase 90% and the surface material began bubbling up even with a gentle wipe. I dampened the cloth lightly (I cared about this board lasting me quite awhile) and pressed a little harder. The surface covering bubble more and even tore and the marks did not go away. I appreciated the fast, sturdy shipping, but the product is of very poor quality and was unusable from the very first dry-erase streak. (Disappointed)

  While I haven't used it yet, I assume the whiteboard itself will work as expected. My problem is the board is warped so much that the adhesive strips barely make contact with the wall, and it kept falling down until I finally took it down. If you're looking for a small whiteboard to carry around in an office to make diagrams or lists, this will probably work. If you're planning to mount it like I was, it may not serve that purpose as well.

  This dry erase board is ""ok"" and only because it was less than $7. If you erase fresh ink, then it's fine. But if you wrote on it an hour ago, it will not erase at all. I had to get a rag dipped in alcohol to remove all marks that we were written earlier in the day, which is not practical at all.It's not the marker, because I tried that on a different board and it erased fine hours later. I've also tried better quality markers on this board and even they wouldn't erase after an hour. Since most people are not erasing as soon as they write something, I'd say this is more like a ""wet erase board"" than anything. I would not recommend this board.

  These dry erase board are good for kids while doing virtual learning. They are sturdy. The only bad thing is that once the plastic cover that does around the board falls off you can’t put it back on. Then the corners of the board can hurt you. You would have to somehow bend the corners so they don’t poke thru.

  Great little dry erase board.  Not cheaply made.  My only complaint is I wish the mounting system was a little better.  I would have liked to have mounted this to my fridge using magnets.  This has adhesive velcro.  I don't want to stick adhesive onto my fridge.  So I left it not mounted.  Not sure how it would stick on my wall.  I don't want it to take the paint off if I try to move it.  It comes with a little magnet and a dry erase marker.  The dry erase marker has a little fabric to erase the marker on the board.

  I give this four stars cuz it's very inexpensive, but some little nit pickiness1. The dry erase marker dried up within a few days.1.5 - I ordered some expo dry erase markers which are great, came with a big eraser, because the erase on the marker that comes with the kit is very small. the marker holder on the board doesn't fit them. I tried to do my own little fix and force bend it and applying a bit of heat with a lighter which kind worked to tighten up the holder so it can hold the thinner expo dry erase2. There's a little magnet thing I guess to mark if you have a to do. The plastic falls of easily, and the magnet remains but with the sticky side. I guess you could add more adhesive or somethin3. The cap of the dry erase marker gives the impression that you can put it on the back like a pen, and it slips in but falls out easily4. The adhesive it comes with seem reasonable. I did put it on the back, but I haven't removed the cover to stick it on anything

Unless you want to risk damaging your refrigerator with the Velcro strips, you would need to glue magnets on. Otherwise it’s a good whiteboard. The description was just a little misleading.

  I must have misread the item, it is magnetic yes, but it doesn't come with magnets to stick onto your fridge, it comes with double sided adhesive velcro, so you have to permanently attach velcro to your fridge (or wherever you want this) if you want to hang it. Or you can purchase double-sided magnet strips yourself, but the board is not all that sturdy, and it's warped, so it doesn't fit flush against the fridge surface anyway.

  This is an exact copy of what I bought from Big Lots for about the same price around two years ago. It's a white board with some metal under it so you can stick magnetic things to it. Not much more needs to be said. The surface is a little bit difficult to clear off completely, especially with weeks' worth of marker drying out and attempting to merge with the board, but it does the trick just fine for taking notes that have to be cleared out at the end of a call. If you just need a simple whiteboard for your desk or fridge, go for it. It's not too expensive, and it's a great choice for just quick notes. Maybe there are $150 whiteboards out there, but they won't deliver much better than this. You won't, however, use the included magnet. I promise. It's incredibly weak, and you'd do better with some kind of rare-earth magnet, possibly some spheres that are small enough to carry a lot of them.It's worth the price, but don't expect a miracle. It does its job perfectly fine, but the whiteboard paint comes off pretty easily with any metallic objects like, say, magnets.

  The Velcro stickers will not stick to the wall and will only last so long on your fridge - mine lastef about a week. So, if you have those textured type of walls where the paint is sorta in small globs and not flat, at least in my experience, it will not stick. I will need to buy a hook for it to work on my bedroom wall where I wanted it initially, and now for my fridge. You get what you pay for here guysAlso, the marker it came with works does the job but the eraser is small and after only a few times of using it, it's almost 50% saturated.Do yourself a favor and get a bigger eraser because the residue will fall off the board and onto your floor.

  This is pretty useful to have by your side.  Sure paper isn't hard to find, and computers have notepad software etc. but the simplicity and readiness of this simple little board beats those mentioned in many regards.  And the notes stay current and in your face until they're completed or obsolete.  I'd say this is one of the top 20 most useful things to have around for the thinking man's (fill in your gender) HQ.  You may not use it day 1, but keep it close and you're bound to see it fill up.  As for this one, so far so good.  Erases clean enough with both the cork square and the eraser cap, and the pen writes well.  I'd give it a 5 if it didn't feel like a cheap plastic rectangle, but for what it is... you don't need some titanium edged bedazzled frame to get use out of it.

  Hi, ok here it goes.  This doesn’t have magnets built in.  Just has a metal structure for magnets to stick too.  The construction is very good and will not degrade.  The white face is made out of a completely thick piece of polymer and does not let marker bleed through it.Clean up is awesome and would recommend this product compared to the poor quality versions competing against this. I would suggest purchasing good quality magnets and adhering them to the back of the whiteboard to stick to your fridge.Dont try the others, not worth your time honestly.

  This is a very good and reasonably priced dry erase board.  The front is a glossy, magnetic white surface and the backing is cardboard.  It comes complete with a magnet, a black dry erase marker with eraser cap and although we have not affixed this to a wall, Velcro mounting pieces are on the back.  My kids play games in the basement which often require keeping score or they watch sports games and try to predict the outcome beforehand, so after what seemed like them using several thousand pieces of computer paper or sticky notes to do those things, we picked up this dry erase board so less paper was wasted.  For that purpose it works great.  The black marker sometimes deposits in a manner that gets left behind after dry erasing, so periodically a baby wipe or wet paper towel across the surface is needed.  Otherwise this works well.

  I teach online courses and use this board occasionally in my recorded video lectures, but also when video-chatting with my students. This is a good size (11x14) for using in these environments as it is big enough to write examples and explain concepts to hold up to the camera. The marker that comes with it is average, at best. I would definitely recommend purchasing name-brand markers if you plan to use the board in a professional setting.

  This is great for writing little reminders and keeping track of household bills and such. It comes with four Velcro strips that stick to the surface you want to place the board. The only issue is that once the strips have been stuck in place, they are a bit difficult to get off. The board itself can detach, but the four strips will need to be replaced when we move and take the board with us. Marker works well and hasn’t run out in over five months. Board fits on the top half of our refrigerator door and isn’t very heavy or bulky. Took about five minutes to put together and hang it up.

  How do you review a dry erase board? For one it sticks to the wall without issue. Huge for me because I’ve purchased more expensive ones that fall down. I use one in my kitchen for a to do list, and erase it all the time using a little Mrs. Meyers and a tiny bit of water on a paper towel; works great! It cleans the whole board and there are no annoying faint lines from previous writings. The market they give you works well. One thing that doesn’t work well is the marker holder at the top of the board, I just took it off because it continued to fall off. This wasn’t a big deal to me because I have magnetic markers too. But keep this in mind it that’s a must have. Thanks for reading! 😊

  It attaches via velcro strips which you stick the surface with adhesive, so you cannot use the product multiple times. Once you stick it, that's it – you cannot move it.I suppose one benefit is that the adhesive allows it to stick to many different types of surfaces. But the downside is when you use it on a refrigerator (probably the #1 use-case), then you cannot move it around or use it on the next refrigerator because the adhesive velcro is a one-time permanent sticker. So that sucks.

  The board itself serves its purpose.The marker it comes with works fine but will stain the board if you wipe it off with the eraser on the top. Highly recommend using a microfiber towel to erase if you plan to write with the original marker - you don’t need any fancy cleaners either. Ultimately, I’d suggested using true expo markers on the board to avoid staining it altogether.Doesn’t seem too durable, but as long as you’re not slamming it around and banging it against the walls, it’ll last.

  Works as expected. I hesitated to purchase based on some reviews saying that the ink will stain but for the price,  glad I did buy.  I used the original pen, Expo pens and Expo eraser and  there were no stains left behind. Now  if you use the eraser on the pen, there may be some residue but nothing permanent .  Think of it like using a Qtip vs tissue/wipes to remove your makeup. Attached r before/ after photos  to illustrate that it cleans up well after use.

   It’s just ok for what I need it for, but would not purchase again. The first day I used the built in eraser it broke off, leaving it with just a bit of fluff on the tip, so now I use a tissue anytime I erase something. Also, the cap does not firmly secure to the top of it like every single pen or marker in the world normally does. Another thing that bothers me is you have to place the marker in the holder in JUST THE RIGHT SPOT or it falls out.

Makes losing the markers very easy to do.-Holder clip itself falls off very easy without warning-Surface does not clean well. The U-brand markers do not really erase, they largely just get smeared all over the surface. Most dry erase boards require a periodic cleaning with solvent to get 100% clean, but this one seems to require that with every use.

  It's frankly difficult to call this a dry erase board. The marker that it comes with just smears when you try to erase it, and every marker I've used on this board from other sources has completely stopped working (they don't write anymore on ANY board, not just this one) within less than 10 minutes of use. I thought perhaps my markers were coincidentally running out of ink at the same time, but then I started using markers that were fresh out of the box and they died as well once being used on this board.

  I literally just took it out of the box and noticed several things right away. First off, somebody clearly has used this before. I can see smudges of marker towards the bottom. Also looks like somebody beat it against the wall. You can clearly see the indentions in the board. The bottom plastic is broken. Also last but not least, this isn't magnetic at all. This is the first time I've ever been this disappointed with something I purchased online. Save yourself some money and avoid this junk.

  I'm a homeschooling mom going through a spelling curriculum (All About Spelling) with my son. I wanted a heavy duty but light white board so we both can spell out words. This one fits the bill, it's just the right size and the marker works well. The eraser on the pen is small and doesn't work well so you'll definitely want to use a better eraser, otherwise this board works well! We haven't tried mounting it, we just hold it.

  This product is great. It mounts onto walls and doors easily, and the frame allows for some neat customization (with various add-on's). All of the Expo markers I've purchased have worked quite well with the board, and I definitely appreciate the bonus magnetic paper-weight/paper-holder. The *only* issue I have had so far is with some of the additional accessories you can purchase. If the accessories are too large or heavy, they do not stick magnetically. The associated eraser that I purchased (separately) periodically falls off with little-to-no prompting, and it does indeed feel loosely bound to the board. However, that is the *only* problem I have found so far, after weeks of usage. This board does its job well!

  Purchased this small whiteboard to hang on the wall next to my desk to help keep track of my college work. I was expecting this to be a pretty cheap board that would only adequately serve its purpose, but I've been pleasantly surprised!Yes, the whiteboard itself is pretty cheap, but the pen it comes with is actually very good quality. It also helps that the board has a spot specifically for the black pen, which makes it extremely convenient to use. Not to mention, the pen also has an eraser on the end- which means everything I need for the board is always on the board.My only gripe with this product is that the adhesion strips are not 100% reliable. I've woken up startled several times since purchasing this due to it falling off during the middle of the night. Luckily, it's easy to put right back onto the wall, but still, it does detract some quality from it. Otherwise, I have no complaints!

It feels like its going to break when I'm writing on it without placing it on a surface and just holding it in air.
