  The phone came in perfect condition and first I was really hesitating on buying this phone and as soon as the package came I ripped it open in the phone looked amazing the battery life is at 78% but I don't mind there wasn't a single scratch on the front and back of the phone if you're looking to buy a refurbished iPhone 7 32GB model this is the perfect phone for you üòÅüòÅ

  The IMEI number for the phone is blocked. Meaning the phone is NOT unlocked and was either lost, stolen or unpaid bill.  What a waste of time and energy waiting on this phone for nothing.

    Sold With Bad Hardware

  I had this phone for about a month before it just turned off and wouldn‚Äôt turn on past the Apple logo. I took it to the Apple store and they told me that it had hardware issues. I hadn‚Äôt dropped it or bumped it on anything. I had a heavy duty case and screen protector. This phone was sold to me in this condition and I ended up trading in the 7 for store credit and forking over more money for a new phone. I do not recommend buying a refurbished phone from this vendor.

  Do not waist your money. Phone came with a scratch on the screen. Phone will not load any pictures on Facebook, I have to use a laptop if I want to go on Facebook. My old iPhone 6 with a smashed screen works better then this POS. Thanks for a waste of time and money, going to send it back.  Even tried going on the internet Facebook instead of the app and still NOTHING will load. iPhone 4 works better then this. Really aggravating.

  Bought this iPhone renewed because I only use it as phone, and a little browsing, directions when traveling.  Use my mini iPad more because my eye sight is not what it use to be, iPhone is hard to read sometimes.  Anyway, this was a good fit and buy for the amount of use that I do.  Did not see spending hundreds, even thousands of dollars for a phone I only use occasionally.  So far i have not had any issues with it due to being a used iPhone.

  I got the phone on time and was happy to find that the phone was almost brand new. I was skeptical because I had previously purchased a refurbished iPhone 7 from BuySpry which turned out to be the model of the phone meant to be used in Japan, making it unable to mute the camera shutter noise. By the time I realized that was the issue, the return window had closed. Anyway, it seems like one of the best deals for an iPhone 7.

I scheduled an appointment with apple . They said it was a hardware problem . There is this program for iphone 7 with no service problem. They would fix the phone for free . But after they ran a diagnostic in my phone . They said my phone does not qualify for a free repair because it‚Äôs a refurbished phone .

  The phone looks new and there's no scratches unlike other people comment but the thing is that when I charge the phone it's getting hot and the battery don't last. I just used it for like 10-15 mins and it's already half of the battery life and it's getting hotter and hotter when you used it. I returned it anyways coz I'm afraid that the phone might explode while I used it or I charge it. I'm soooo disappointed coz this is my first iphone and also this is the first time I ordered through online. Lesson learned but its a great experience though. I hope this will help those people who's thinking of buying a refurbished phone. My advise is that always rethink coz not everyone is lucky to get a good phone like the other says in the comment.

  First of all, activating this phone has been a long arduous process but is not the fault of the seller!I lost my cell phone, so I didn't have a sim card to transfer.  I bought this phone along with the sim card from Amazon.  I then took the phone to my verizon provider (not an actual verizon store) with the sim card inside.  I told them I needed the card activated.  They told me the phone is NOT a verizon phone and they could  not activate it.  When I got home I noted at the top that it said verizon and had full bars plus internet.  After calling verizon they reiterated that it was not a verizon phone by the IMEI number.  I proceeded to put in a complaint to the seller, who promptly called me.  He told me that the sim card has to be activated and the phone will work and promised to make good on my purchase.  He told me to call verizon again and ask to have the sim card activated and to call him back with my results.  VIOLA....a very helpful agent at verizon activated the card and the phone immediately was activated!  So....if your verizon carrier says your phone won't work, they may be wrong!  I am very happy with the phone and the service provided by the seller.

    Looks great, battery won't hold charge long - not covered under warranty

  Phone was in great shape.  However, the battery kept draining very quickly.  I do not run videos or surf the internet and deleted everything I could that showed it used much battery life.  Even though the health of the battery screen would show Max capacity of 73%, after one or two short phone calls, the battery would drain quickly by almost 35% on the spot many times.  I called the seller within my 3 month phone warranty period to explain I had a bad battery and had done all I could to make it work.  They said the battery isn't covered under the phone warranty and that I should buy a new battery.  After explaining it came with a battery that drains quickly the seller said they would give my a $12 ""courtesy refund"".  I found out that new batteries cost $50 installed.  They said the max they would give me was $20 but to this day, I have not received anything.  I scheduled and took it to an Apple store and paid the $50 myself.  Beware, these phones from this seller can come with a bad battery and you are basically on your own to schedule a replacement and pay for it.  I had already paid Verizon to change my old Iphone to this one so sending the whole phone back in for a replacement or refund would mean I would have had to reschedule Verizon and pay them again to change phone information.  Easier for me to have Apple put in a new battery.  What an amazing amount of scheduling and time wasted.

  My 11year old lost his iPhone and I gave up trying to locate it.  Looked into various ways to replace it and settled on purchasing an unlocked one online (a Walmart clerk recommended going online).  I was a bit hesitant to do so, but I did.  The phone arrived complete with a cord and adapter along with instructions on what to do to activate the phone.  Proceeded to the AT&T store to get a new SIM card‚Äîagain absolutely no issues.  Phone works great, battery life is fine/ no issues with either screen or speaker (thus far).  I chose the 7 due to Apple‚Äôs tendency to not push software to older phone models.  This vendor shipped in a timely manner, well packaged.  Would not hesitate to purchase again from them.

  Stopped working the minute an update was required.  As in: gives an error message saying you cannot make or receive calls or otherwise use the cellular data until you update to iOS 13.  Which is obviously absurd.  But to compound it, once you download the update, it won't let you install it.  Basically as soon as an update is required, it turns your phone into a brick so that you have to buy a new one if you actually want, like, a phone.  That does phone stuff.  Like calling people.  Or using it outside a WiFi zone (god forbid this happens at 10pm on a Saturday night so you've no way to call an Uber, or a friend, or anything or anyone or do anything whatsoever...as it did to me).  Literally it just took away the entire phone component.  Made it unusable.  ""Unless you upgrade to an iOS that we actually won't let you upgrade to, then you can't have a telephone.  Not even to call 911.  Sorry.""  Yeah.  Don't buy from this place.

The SIM card tray jutted out a bit and after looking online at images of iPhone 7‚Äôs, I figured out this wasn‚Äôt apart of the design, red flag but it didn‚Äôt affect the performance of the iPhone from what I could tell. The phone needed to be updated, once again no big deal. But for someone who wants a phone that‚Äôs ready to use, the update time might be an issue.Now I will get to my 2 star rating. As I‚Äôm setting up the phone for my mother, I noticed it was running really hot on the back upper part of the phone, opposite the camera. A software update and transferring data could cause this so I set the phone to the side to cool off a bit when I was done. Two days later and the phone barely keeps a charge. This problem with the old phone was the reason I bought this iPhone 7. Needless to say I will be returning this product. It could just be a defective one out of the bunch.

  This phone worked at the beginning with AT&T. AT&T customer service told us that the phone contract had not been paid off - that's why it was locked to AT&T. I don't know if it legal to sell a phone that you haven't fully paid, but hey at least it worked on the AT&T network. After two years I asked about whether we can unlock it and learned that it was on a ""block list"" because it was reported stolen.  Now we gave it to a friend who tried to use it with AT&T but it won't work anymore.The invoice that we got does not list the phone serial number so there is no proof that we purchased the phone (and no paper trail showing that the dealer sold a phone that is reported as stolen).

",5.0,jeff,"Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2021","









  
  
    
  I gave my Iphone 7 to my son when when I got an Iphone 8 that was a bad call. My 8 went out after only a month and then my new one gave me nothing but issue after issue for the next 12 months. So I decided to buy a used 7 and I had never done that before. I read most all the reviews and the description from the seller first. The seller description is pretty clear on the state of the battery and I never let any of my Iphones I have owned get below 85 percent battery health because I use my phone a lot and all day for work and they seem to start working weird below 80 percent battery health so with that in mind I purchased a battery in anticipation that the battery would be below 85 percent like in the description. They both arrived quickly and my phone came from Seller ""TECHMINT"" and was listed a Verizon phone. So far after about 4 days everything is working perfect and I am almost done with the second draining of the battery completely before charging back up to condition a new battery and I will do it a total of three times. Not sure it really helps but I have either gotten lucky or it does work because I have replaced about 6 batteries in six different phones for me and my family and they work pretty darn good. As for getting back into a 7 it is pretty nice not having the issues of the 8. I could not believe how bad my experience was with the iphone 8 and after having a 6 and a 7 back to back with almost zero issues it wasn't pleasant. I will do an update after I have had it for a while.

  I had purchased a fully unlocked iPhone 7 as a Christmas gift for a friend.  I added him to my MetroPCS account.  He has had it for approximately three months now.  The issues started early February 2020 where he could no longer add apps, then the battery started losing charge and now he cannot use the phone at all because is shows on the screen Locked SIM.  After contacting MetroPCS they said I need to contact Apple which was a nightmare.  I‚Äôm not sure if others have had the same issue with this Amazon approved vendor before, but I will not order from them again.  If there are others who have had a similar experience to let Mr. Bezos know of their situation and urge him to eliminate the supplier.

  I was a little apprehensive about buying a renewed phone on Amazon. Among other potential issues, many sellers claim to sell fully unlocked phones that end up not working with Verizon. Well this purchase went about as perfectly as possible. The phone itself (an iPhone 7) was fully unlocked as advertised. The battery was surprisingly perfect (100% maximum capacity). Everything about the phone worked perfectly and the physical condition was almost perfect. I did have to contact the vendor (BuySPRY) with some questions and they were VERY responsive and seemed very eager to help. I would definitely recommend.

The battery is efficient compared to my phone, which was the same make and model. the screen looks new, and I could not tell the difference. The only little notice is that the SIM card tray has some paint leftover, revealing possible replacement. Aside from that, this phone was the 'deal.'

  My husband bought me a phone for my birthday and had it 2-3 weeks before he gave it to me. When I got it the screen was so sensitive when making a phone call that my hair made it beep and sound like it was dialing. I had to use the speaker setting in order to make calls.The screen also had several dead spots on it. I tried using the phone for 2 weeks and couldn‚Äôt make it work. When we contacted the seller they wanted to replace it. However, I had already bought a new phone and wanted a refund. Even though their motto is something about customer service they refused to refund our money since it was over 30 days. I told them it was a gift that hadn‚Äôt been opened for a couple of weeks and they didn‚Äôt care. They absolutely refused to refund the money even though there were several emails back and forth.I also had to spend $20 to send the malfunctioning one back and today I got another phone in the mail that I do not want.

  I read the good and bad reviews but was hopeful in purchasing this phone, after all you (supposedly) can get your money back if the phone doesn‚Äôt work. The phone seemed good enough upon setup. I didn‚Äôt think much of the strong glue smell upon opening the box. However, the battery would go from 70%+ to dead with minimal use; I was not even streaming movies or music. Then the screen detached from the frame on one side, and I could see into the phone. It smelled strongly of that same glue smell that I noticed when unboxing the phone.The seller approved my refund. I shipped the phone back with tracking. It was delivered to them over two weeks ago, but I still haven‚Äôt gotten my refund, and the seller hasn‚Äôt replied to my message inquiring about the refund.There are good and bad reviews on here. Be warned. It‚Äôs not worth the risk if you can‚Äôt get your money back if you get a dud.

  I have had this phone for two months. When I first purchased this item it was working perfectly, it had been unlocked, I had activated the phone with my Tmobile sim card and the device would make calls, text messages and all cellular service features.however there was ""other system data"" of 20 GB worth that would not allow me to further update the device. About a month later, due to incapability of updating from the ""other system data"" I could no longer make any phone calls or messages with the device. I reached out to Apple Support to learn that the device did not have an update issue, it was not properly unlocked and had simply become locked back to the original Verizon carrier. The device cannot activate again after resetting from Apple. As i am not a verizon customer nor am I the original owner I can no longer use this phone. It is a brick. It is stuck telling me it cannot be activated. BUYER BEWARE This seller does NOT unlock their phones from the carrier and later after purchase it will become locked and bricked.

    Great Renewed iPhone for a Pretty Good Price

  Bought this iPhone with a guarantee from iCertified (the seller) that the product would work with my carrier (Verizon) and that it was fully unlocked. I have experienced no issues since inserting the SIM card. I understand some reviews state that the iPhone was not fully unlocked for all carriers, but again, I experienced no issues. This iPhone is a great price for the condition it is in. It came already factory reset and looking almost new. It did come with a lightning cord and USB to wall converter from Apple. It even had approximately 50% battery when turned on. No issues with delivery either. Overall, this iPhone is a very good product, has a good price, and is in good condition.

  First of all, everything has been totally fine except for the camera, so I can't complain too much. However, the rear-facing camera didn't focus well and took pretty blurry pictures. I didn't want to go through the hassle of sending the phone in and setting a new one up so I just got it fixed at a local place for $70. The guy who fixed it for me today said probably the screen was cracked on the old one, and then dust and debris got into the phone and wreaked havoc on things including the camera. After he worked on it he was able to identify that the camera bit was replaced with a cheap model that doesn't work well. He replaced it with a better camera bit and now it works fine. Of course, I don't know exactly what happened before I got the phone, but I would recommend using better products if this was in fact the case. Although I am not returning the phone, I probably wouldn't buy another one from them. The 3 out of 5 stars for value for $ was purely because of this and because I had to find someone to repair it and pay additional $ for that.

  Apple technician at the Apple store noted the inscriptions and coding on the back of the phone and told us it was not an iPhone, and likely a Chines replica. So although it looks and smells like one...and is advertised and sold as one, it is in fact NOT an iPhone...which is fraud. On top of that, the battery capacity is already down to 87%, which means it will have to be replaced soon, and the charging cord sent does not work.  I knew there was some risk getting a renewed phone, but didn't expect that risk to be that the phone wasn't even originally made by Apple.

  The phone arrived in pristine condition. You could not tell it was refurbished. But more importantly what I like about the seller was communication. The seller has a very high approval rating. I see most third-party sellers 15 to 20 points lower in approval. If you read the reviews the majority of the negative reviews have to do communication. They were a few bumps along the road with a sale but the sellers communication was almost instantaneous every time I wrote a message. I have had my phone for a week now. It works great.

  I was in the market for a replacement iPhone for my 6S, in which the battery was on its last leg.  Not to mention I maxed out the 32GBs of space on it because of the apps I use for work and pleasure.  So, I decided to go with the iPhone 7 with more space and did a little research on Google.  Came across this seller, saw this iPhone 7 128GB unlocked and read the description and reviews.  After seeing many positives and the overall rating being high, I decided to take a chance and order it. ...  I was extremely impressed with the condition it was in when I received it.  It was beyond mint condition.  Not even a scratch or blemish on the screen or the back.  Nothing.  It was like it was brand new!  I was absolutely delighted!  I wish I had taken pics of it when I first got it.  But, trust me, it was beyond mint condition out of the box!...  The battery was at 86% when I received it.  I obviously expected this, as the seller clearly stated in their description of the phone.  Therefore, I don't know why some of the people in the reviews were complaining about this, when the seller clearly stated this in the description.  Although the battery life was so-so after I started using it, I decided to go to an authorized Apple repair facility near me that does 2-hour service and have the battery replaced for $49.  Now the battery is at 100% and my iPhone 7 works as if it's brand new from Apple!  So, overall, with the cost of my phone purchase ($188) and the cost of the battery replacement ($49), I ended up spending $237 total.  You can't beat the price for a used iPhone 7 128GB black.  I couldn't be happier!!  I definitely plan on buying another phone from this seller in the future.  I highly recommend them.  I would give them 4 stars because of the battery, but I gave the 5 stars because they were upfront about it, not to mention my phone was in nearly brand new condition.  Thank you!! :-)

  An iPhone battery that falls under 80% is best to be replaced through an authorized Apple location!

I needed a phone when my iPhone X stopped working and I would much rather have spent an extra $250 more for something newer. You can‚Äôt use this phone for anything without it needing to stay on the charger. Everything else works normally. As it states expect cosmetic damage. Nothing that has impact on functionality though. Ask for the battery capacity before you buy it. Anything over 75% should last at least 8 months/year before needing a battery replacement.

  Recieved the phone on the day it was scheduled. It was in a surprisingly good condition beside a scratch on the back. The phone is good except it cant connect to my network but I called apple and they said it is a common bug in the A1660 modelcand I qualify forbath good model, so all in all I got my money's worth because apple will be giving me a new phoneEdit: the phone is in service the day after it arrived. I went to apple store and they scheduled an appointment for me. I waited 30 mins and they tested the see why why sim card didnt work and it was because they said the sim card that works for my galaxy s8 doesnt work in a iphone, the person called sprint and idk what they did but I left with a new sim card and my iphone has connection with sprint. I thought the back of the iphone had a scratch but my eyes were deceived. Everyone I showed the phone to says it looks brand new. I would buy this as a gift

  All of the reviews that I have seen on this product are at least 2 years old. I had just bought this phone, which I‚Äôm using right now, and it‚Äôs working fine other than a slight discoloration I wouldn‚Äôt have noticed if I didn‚Äôt have my old phone sitting next to me. My battery health was 90% when I received it which really isn‚Äôt a problem for me since I‚Äôm not on it all the time. It does take a lot longer to charge but not a ridiculous amount of time. I think that Amazon probably has a better product inspection set in place rather than 2 years ago. But it all comes down to, as with most products on here, whether you bite the bullet and buy it or don‚Äôt. All in all I‚Äôm really happy with this phone and mine almost looked like new when I received it.

  I bought an iphone 7 back in December. After a few weeks I had trouble connecting to my carrier's service signal, but it seemed to work OK after turning airplane mode on and back off again, which is why I didn't return it. After 5 months it just wouldn't get service at all. Took the phone to AT&T, then to Apple, where they would charge me 130 dlls to fix it. I contacted the seller, who said he couldn't do anything for me since the warranty had already expired (3 months).I had to buy a new phone (this time from Apple directly, I learned my lesson), luckily they gave me a $200 credit for the detective phone.

  I just got it for two hours, so the review would be changed after a couple of days using.1. It is pre-owned. no scratch, but wear can be seen around the back camera, speaker and mute button.2. The model is A1779, which is a Japanese version. Due to the Japanese law, it cannot be mute (even you turn off the sound) when taking photos... it really annoying me, it is a basic requirement in my mind... I really did not expect Amazon would ship me a Japanese version... so -1 star.3. The battery is not healthy. It shows 79% maximum capacity in the battery report. Compares to my own IPhone7+ which has been used for almost years, it is 86%. so -1 star.4. Extremely hot... I'm not sure whether it is a common issue for IPhone7, but this one got extremely hot when I recover all apps from icloud. will keep monitoring it and update the result later.

They sent me a check to find my own and so I got a refurb here in my desired color.Everything is pretty much equivalent to my original phone in wear and tear (minor scratches and dings) aside from the fact that the screen lifts on the bottom left a little and I feel it may be effecting the touch screen efficiency.I was also surprised to find it had a screen cover already on it when I received it which I bought separately with the phone not expecting that bonus!

  This arrived 2 DAYS after I ordered it. It came much earlier than expected which is amazing! I see many reviews that say it isn't compatible with different networks but it worked perfectly when I activated it with Sprint. And despite its price it works great! It's not slow and the battery doesn't drain too quickly or anything like that. I, honestly, highly recommend this product!! 5 Stars all the way!

  The most terrible and worst decision ever made was to purchase a phone from this seller. They sell models of the phone which eventually fail because of antena issues. It just constantly says ‚Äúsearching‚Äù or ‚Äúno service‚Äù when there clearly is service.  I didn‚Äôt know that this specific model was actually a recalled model back when they initially released the phone. I do not recommend buying from a seller who sells recalled items.I contacted them and they couldn‚Äôt do anything about it. This was their reply. ‚Äú I am sorry this has happed, however, the item is no longer covered under warranty.‚Äù At least learn how to type correctly. Such a rip off.

",4.0,StonyRiverDave,"Reviewed in the United States April 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  This phone seems perfectly functional and is cosmetically excellent with just a few small unnoticeable scratches from perhaps attempting to open it up.  The battery was only at 82% capacity with mid 400 cycles.  That is probably not unexpected for an iPhone 7.  It did look like someone tried to open it up, but gave up, as the adhesive strips holding the display assembly to the body were intact.I replaced the battery with a LeeVee 2350 mAh better than OEM battery to get the battery life back to normal. The poor battery is why I gave an overall 4 stars.Battery replacement of iPhones after iPhone 6 is much more difficult due to the adhesive holding the case together,  being more challenging to open. Replacing the adhesive is also tricky.  You can omit the adhesive strip, but then you lose the water resistance.

Had to carefully push the rubber in while pushing the tray. Tmobile sim works fine. Updated to latest ios smoothly. Good responsive touch.

    Don‚Äôt buy from BuySpry or Amazon Refurbished
  
",1.0,Aldo M.,"Reviewed in the United States February 22, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this phone amazon refurbished and paid a premium for it since I figured it would be a better quality phone that would perform like new. Boy was I wrong, anything you buy that says refurbished means it was once broken and will most likely still be broken when you receive it like in my case. They tell you they fully inspect the phone for faulty hardware but they don‚Äôt at all, if they did they would realize that the earpiece was blown and now I can‚Äôt hear anybody clearly when on the phone or when I play a video it uses the earpiece as a speaker and sounds horrible, the proximity sensor also never worked and my screen doesn‚Äôt turn off when I make a call, I am constantly putting people on hold because my cheek presses the button every time. The battery came in at 84% capacity so right out the gate it needed a new battery because the speed of the phone is lowered by apple if you have a worn battery. All of these defects were present as soon as I received the phone and should of been tested for. Buyspry will sell you a junk phone that looks nice but is unusable as an actual phone. Amazon just turns its back on this practice and defaults any questions or repairs back to BuySpry instead of backing their 90 day refurbished electronics gaurantee. The phone has numerous glitches with the software as well, all around I feel duped to have bought this phone and paid extra for the ‚Äúamazon refurbished‚Äù seal which does nothing for you. Don‚Äôt buy, go to apple directly for refurbished phones.

I will be bringing it to Apple to hopefully get it fixed. According to many sites, after the last update AT&T did certain iphone 7 models no longer work. Apple is offering a free fix but only if the phone is less then 3 years old. Being that I have no idea when this was first purchased I am hoping it will get fixed.

  I love this phone.  It is perfect for my son!  It was unlocked and I was able to use it for my Safelink Tracfone account.  I had no issues with activating. I just had to call my provider to activate because I was not sure who it was unlocked from.  My provider was able to tell me that it was an Verizon phone but was unlocked and it simply had to be changed over to AT&T since that‚Äôs the Sim card that I picked.  It took nearly 5 to 10 minutes for them to do so.  The phone itself came with a tempered glass already on it so I was pleased to see that.  The sound quality and picture seems to be excellent and I am very pleased. There are no visible scratches dents or defaults. This phone looks like it is brand new! This seems to be an excellent product for a very excellent price.

  It can sometimes be risky purchasing refurbished phones, but after doing my research I come to this product page and ordered the Rose Gold - iPhone 7 128GB from MyWit. Also trust and loved that this purchased is backed by the Amazon renewed program, so if there were any issues, I will be supported for up to 90-days after purchase.As expected, the phone arrived in non-Apple packaging with no headphones. What I was not expecting was that it also came with the Apple charging brick and cable. The phone looked GREAT, with no scratches (I would have been OK with minor scratches since I am purchasing something refurbished) and no cracks/smooth front screen. The only little, temporary, issue I saw was a little dust in the speakers/mic holes at the bottom of phone. It was a simple fix, I simply clean the area with a brush and the phone looked exactly like new! Tested phone calls on loudspeaker and the speakers work fine!I have used the phone for a while now and it continues to work beautifully. This iPhone 7 came with iOS 12 running out of the box, which was fine by me. Even checked the battery health with the new iOS and it was at 89% (very fair, actually expected something lower).Your experience (packaging, phone condition, etc) may not be exactly the same as mine since each phone is different, but this was definitely a great purchase for the price. Definitely be open-minded if you are interested in a refurbished phone and be OK if the phone does not arrive 100% in perfect condition.This is my personal review, I will update this review if anything else changes!

I was pleasantly surprised i could use wireless and sing on my karaoke ap! Right away the transition from android to iphone went smooth.

  This phone was advertised as fully unlocked. I waited 3 days for this phone (mine is not holding a battery charge anymore, and needed it ASAP for my school and work).

Also, it had an old screen protector on it from whoever previously had it, which I didn‚Äôt want on the phone.Edit: I contacted the seller BluSpry and they told me that although it stated it was unlocked, it couldn‚Äôt be guaranteed that it would be unlocked for the carriers it stated.

  Device looks absolutely pristine. Functionally there are several issues. Battery life is quite poor and was clearly not replaced as part of the refurbishing process as I had anticipated which means I will need to pay for a replacement. The home button is extremely temperamental and works about every other time and every third or fourth time when attempting the double click feature. About Every tenth text notification will repeatedly chime until I actually open the text. Lots of little annoying things that I would not expect from a phone that had actually been refurbished. Pretty dissatisfied with advertising of product compared to actual functionality of product. I doubt this product was even serviced before being sold.Edit: included in my package was a slip of paper saying I could get a $10 amazon gift card for leaving an honest review.

Apple offered to replace it for +$750. It should have never been sold and shipped to us. Generally speaking, it sucked.

  I bought this phone to replace my identical iPhone 7 which I accidentally broke. It is terrible!!! The battery last a few hours tops! The home button is barely responsive and the phone is SUPER SLOW!!! I brought it to apple to ask if they could look at it and they said the battery is functioning at less than 50% and the home button should be replaced! The combined cost will be almost $300 dollars! I wish I could just return it but I can‚Äôt be without a phone for work and don‚Äôt have time to set up another!

  All seemed as expected from the seller and from description except battery life was not 80% or above as stated in listing but 70%.The biggest issue with this was having to pay, send phone back and still awaiting refund all because of a simple check that should have been done to make sure battery life was as promised.This just makes me think if this seller is not doing this simple check before sending, then what else are they not checking with these phones.

  After reading reviews on both ends of the star spectrum, I was apprehensive about the arrival of my first ever refurbished phone. I worried that it might be a lemon, but it exceeded my expectations! I was delighted to find a complementary screen protector and clear case included in my package. I checked the battery health right away and was happily surprised to see that it was at 100% peak performance capacity.  The exterior of the phone was unscathed and could have been mistaken for brand new. I continue to monitor everything to see if there are any quirks or bugs that will appear with time but, so far, I have no complaints. I'd recommend a refurbished phone to even the most skeptical buyer.

  Tried to use with Verizon and found out the phone sent will not work on Verizon. The in-store Verizon rep told me that the iPhone 7 is notorious for ""fully unlocked"" versions not working on non-GSM networks. He said the older iPhone 7's were manufactured to be carrier-specific and cannot connect with other carriers, even when fully unlocked; however, newer iPhone 7's can. So I guess I wasn't lucky enough to get a ""newer"" refurbished iPhone 7. It seems like Breed (the seller) would know this and make changes accordingly.

  Aside from all the issues I like the phone. But right off the bat I noticed the battery had 63% capacity when the product description says it comes with 80%. When I contacted them about it they told me I could go get it replaced and send them a picture of my receipt, instead of replacing it themselves. I just bought a new battery myself. Fast forward a while and I‚Äôm listening to music when the phone decides to shut off suddenly and restart. When it restarts the WiFi will not work, the option is greyed out, and the Bluetooth option is just a spinning gear that doesn‚Äôt stop so I cannot turn it on or off. Since then it‚Äôs been restarting constantly and I‚Äôm tired of it. So once again, I wouldn‚Äôt bother buying from this seller. Their product isn‚Äôt worth the money.

",3.0,BILLY,"Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  This phone is definitely worth the price. My phone came looking brand new without a scratch on the screen or the back. I know that some other people have reviewed phones that have come with scratches all over them, but mine wasn‚Äôt like that. It also has all the buttons and systems working perfectly, including the fingerprint reader. That being said because of the price that means you have to make a few compromises. My battery health is only at 85% so the battery does not last as long as a brand new phone(only about 5 hours), but it still lasts pretty well for me. Also the camera shutter sound cannot be disabled on my phone and that may be because my phone is from Korea or Japan where the shutter sound cannot be disabled. I thought that my phone would be coming with a lightning cord power adapter(dongle?) like other Apple phones because the wording in the description was a little confusing, but instead it came with a different cord. It also does not come with headphones so so I had to buy them separate. My phone also came about a week later than expected but I think that was more to blame on the mail shipping service. I would say that as long as you are willing to make some compromises for the price that this phone is worth it. I felt a little nervous buying a pre-owned phone without seeing it first and felt like it was a little bit of a gamble, but it was worth the risk.

If your iPhone fits this timeline, you'll next want to match the model number. In China, model numbers A1660 and A1780 were affected. Hong Kong, Macao, and the US will be model number A1660, and Japan will have model number A1779.I submitted my phone to Best Buy geek squad and they sent the phone to apple on 2/16/2020 for repair or replacement and they responded on 3/9/2020 stating that the phone was deemed to be ""tampered"" and was sent back unrepaired. They also sent a letter stating "" Our technicians carefully inspected the product you sent to us. They determined that the product is ineligible for service, so we're returning it to you now. The reason your product isn't working is because of unauthorized modifications that were made to it. Our warranty doesn't cover issues caused by unauthorized modifications.I contacted the seller TRADEMORE and they responded saying:We provide a 90 day warranty for our devices from the date it was purchased. Unfortunately, your device exceeds the warranty window and we cannot provide a refund.I'm now left without a working iPhone 7 covered under any warranty because the seller is conducting unauthorized modifications that disqualifies the phone under Apples warranty and is now considered tampered. I should have gotten a replacement IPHONE 7 from APPLE since this model was an affected model. I believe the seller was aware of this warranty issue and is scamming buyers not aware of the manufacture defect. Please beware of this seller moving forward!!!!!!!!!!! Shady business practice!

  Prompt shipping. Phone looks brand new. Works great, but it has only been a couple of days. The battery is only 84%, but that is to be expected on a refurbished phone, and can be easily replaced in the future. All good so far! 100% happy.

  Good: 90-day return policy. The phones themselves looked clean and presentableBad: I ordered two refurbed iPhone 7s. Mixed results, somewhat bad.The first had a dirty recharger unit that I had to clean, and an existing screen saver that looked like an amateur install. It was also missing the sim card tray, so I had to order one for $5 on Amazon, because I figured that was easier and faster than contacting Amazon/seller.  The phone works fine.The second was defective and would not make calls or texts, even after swapping an existing and working sim card. Part of the return process was an option to call Amazon for help troubleshooting. That resulted in an immediate and friendly person who also put Apple support on a three-way call, who confirmed it was defective.So I returned it.

  Be careful ordering from this seller. Do not buy. When I received the phone, I went to turn it on at the boost mobile store and he was able to give me a new sim card, (which I paid for) and a number. The boost mobile store guy then told me it was not picking up a signal and he tried updating the phone, and it did not work. He told me that it was a known iphone 7 problem, and I had to go to the apple store. I went to the apple store who first told me they would send the phone out (to I am guessing apples corporation because they could not fix it in the store) and give me a phone to use until I get mine back. Another lady then came to me and said since the phone was refurbished that they would send it out but the corporation would just send it back unfixed because it is refurbished, so they gave me another option to trade my iphone 7 in to them since it is in perfect condition and it is worth $250 off of whatever phone I buy from them. I then looked up the ‚Äúproblem‚Äù the iphone 7‚Äôs are having, and it says some iphone 7‚Äôs Apple has determined that a small percentage of iPhone 7 devices may show ""No Service"" in the status bar (even if cellular coverage is available), due to a component that has failed on the main logic board, the seller also lied and said thathe checked everything to see if it works, which he lied he knew it would be like this. Now I am going through all this trouble teying to figure out what to do, so beware you will be waisting your money, and time.

  Horrible product and horrible customer service! I went through two of these pieces of junk and now I'm out $240 because the printed label didnt have a correct tracking number when I returned THE SECOND ONE because they had so many issues! I bought the first one and it had a serious microphone issue so I returned that one and got a replacement one. Then that one had a software issue that couldn't be fixed and I had to return it too, swearing off this seller and their shoddy product. Turns out it wasn't over because even though I printed the label and sent it on it's way, it has disappeared and the number given is not a tracking number. I emailed the seller and they want the tracking number that isnt a real one. I called UPS and checked. There is no correct tracking number. Tried to talk to amazon about it and they give me the run around and sent me back to the seller! I've been swindled out of $240 by some guy named Jesus Andrade in TX after spending weeks of pulling my hair out trying to get these phones to work. Pieces of junk and an even crappier seller. Should be banned from Amazon. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND SANITY AND DONT BUY FROM THEM.

You have decided to criticize us with your feedback while it is your own fault not knowing how to submit a review even though I have provided the steps to do so! We have issued more than 50 $10 gift cards to the customers who submitted reviews so far and if you go through the reviews you will see that no one is complaining about not receiving the credit except you.Good luck,JasmineMy Reply-Ok first off... it was not done JUST NOW! I had done this the day that you asked me to (8/1)... I actually have the e-mail i sent to you with the feedback email and I emailed you 3 times since then... this was NOT my fault...

With said picture.Then I sent a NEW e-mail because I was unsure if you were receiving the other 2... with another picture...And still did not hear anything back... Which is why I was frustrated... To attack me when I stated why I was frustrated is unnecessary.. I had actually changed my feedback review because I was frustrated with not hearing back, when the card you sent in your packages states I would hear at least SOMETHING in 24 hours... Looking back.

",3.0,Catholic W.,"Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2018","









  
  
    
  In less than a month of receiving the phone, the side silence button/switch broke. I called customer service and besides the fact that the agent was very unfriendly and seemed confused as to why I would call about a defected product instead of going to get it fixed myself. She said I could return it for a refund. That would obviously leave me without a phone so I decided to wait and see if I could get it fixed at a shop for cheap (update: it's not a cheap fix). Now two months into having the phone, the phone randomly restarted overnight and became locked again. After calling my carrier, they (and a local phone store) said that the phone's contract must have expired overnight and the phone was turned off...so the phone wasn't actually fully unlocked. I keep trying to call customer service but even when I leave a message (as told to do so when the lines are busy), no one gets back to me. It's been a headache.UPDATE: I changed it up to three stars from one star. After one customer service agent saying they were simply too busy to talk on the phone and trying to explain what the problem was and how to fix it despite me telling them that I had already tried that and it didn't work, another customer service agent called me and told me they'd issue me a refund and then ship it back with a prepaid label after I was able to find a new phone. The phone did work with TMobile, as mentioned by other users, though the fact that the button broke less than a month after I received it was still frustrating. I do appreciate the last customer service agent's help.

There is no muting it with the phone on or off silent mode! The only way to take a silent photo is using the ""Live"" photo mode in the camera. It will still make a little ""beep"" when finished capturing. Its one minor flaw to get such a good phone at a decent price.

  So at first i was  a bit skeptical because of all the old reviews but the phone seams to be working grate. I have tested everything and it all works. The only problem i've had is when i put my att sim card in it would not receive data. A error message would come up and say that it could not activate cellular data, found out after i called att that when i put my sim in it wasn't updating my imei number on my account. It was still using my old phones imei number but once i got that fixed it works like a charm. Another thing i dont like is it comes with a screen protector already on the phone, and my only concern for that is if its getting shipped in hot weather the screen might heat up and the protector getting missed a line. then when you get the phone its already hardened again and then you have to try to find away to get it re-a-lined. but other then those two things its a good phone. Comes with power block, sim tool, and charger.

  I don't normally write negative reviews, because I understand mistakes get made, but this is a different story. I ordered a 128GB Jet Black iphone 7, when it arrived 2 days later it was actually a 128GB Rose Gold iphone 7. Not a huge problem, because I just needed a cheap-ish phone to replace my old iphone that broke.2nd issue, the battery showed at 66% usable life and needed to be serviced. According to the Amazon Renewed information, all phones will be shipped with a minimum of 80% usable battery remaining. Literally holds a charge for about an hour or two.3rd issue, discovered a dead spot on the screen at the bottom right in the middle, making it impossible to select anything. Again, Amazon Renewed states all phones are inspected and in full working order. Missing a large dead spot on the screen makes it seem like the phone was not inspected at all.Beware buying Amazon Renewed. I was given piece of mind by the guarantees laid out in the quality of the phones, however the reality is that is just not the case.

(either hardware not from apple was used, hardware was damaged & still refurbished) So, Buyer beware! These ""refurbished"" phones may not actually work for any reasonable length of time.To be clear, this phone was 100% functional with no issues until  it could not take the update & restore. It had been in a lifeproof case since leaving the sellers box. NO damage of any kind.

  I never write reviews but customers, BEWARE, I just ordered an iPhone 7 from this seller, and the noise on my phone when I make calls DOES NOT WORK!! Specifically, phone calls ONLY work when I put the call on speaker so if I do not have the speaker on, I cannot hear the person at all - but for some reason, they can hear me no matter what. I have tried restarting my phone, playing with volume, resetting my phone, and doing everything in the books to try and fix this, but the phone clearly arrived broken.

  Just over 4 months after purchase, product stopped connecting to phone lines. I can no longer place or receive calls. Apple allowed me to send in the phone and determined it had been improperly tampered with to unlock from prior carrier, so it is now useless . GM Deals has a policy of no returns, refunds, or replacement after 3 months.""Fixed"" (or more accurately ""broken"" to allow temporary use on another carrier) just enough to get my money and refuse return, but not really fixed. Apparently was originally Verizon phone altered by Amazon seller GM Deals (without Apple authorization) to be T-Mobile ready, but the alteration didn't hold and broke the phone.I've bought plenty of used phones through Amazon (not refurbished), but never again. Pushed me to do some research though, so grateful for that. Never again trusting Amazon sellers' refurbished phones. Going to Backmarket.com from here on out (12 months), but also avoid GM Deals phones there.

  I've owed the product for over a month or two.This product is clearly used, it's not even shipped in the original box. Often the phone is still dirty as if is was just taking out of the phone case for years. The cord is not iPhone original some weird off brand ""Ashley"". The speaker for phone calls must have been damaged I can't hear much. I resort to speaker a lot unforcefully, which leaves no room for privacy. The touch screen is iffy, not sure if it the phone case and or the new abilities with the 7 (touch sensitive). Either way it doesn't always respond to my finger. Or it'll erase what I just typed in.... Maybe the previous owner allowed water damage. There no prier info on these phones either, which would be greatly appreciated. Lastly the home screen ""button"" clicks when I just touch the bottom parts of my phone. I don't know ppl this was supposed to be my new forever phone, unfortunately with the prier damage I'll have to buy another phone in the next year to come. $200 is not a joke right now in our times.

  First, seller did a great job and I think I got a good price for an iPhone 7, I just think ALL CELL PHONES are way way way too expensive. When a Cell phone costs more than a good laptop computer that is too expensive.  Second all Smart phones have horrible battery life.  Apple's iPhones are no exception.  There is a mode on the iPhone 7 to allow for an extended battery life setting.  But I see no difference between the extended setting and the normal setting.  I do not use my phone except for emergencies so I would expect the phone to last 5-6 days between charging, but I am averaging 3-4 days between charging.  I am having an issue that the WiFi doesn't see both of my wireless networks (dual band router). Seller tried to help but Apple's support said if it sees a network that's all they care about.  Phone appears to be working fine and so far I am happy with it.

  This phone does work with Verizon . It even came with a free screen protector on it which made up for the fact the music adapter part and headphones did not come with it . The gigabytes were accurate . The only thing was there was a price tag tape which was difficult and left marks coming off but it‚Äôs worth it . I would recommend sending it to a fedex drop off site such as Walgreens because it did come early and I had to have it re routed because of my work schedule . The camera quality is excellent . You do not need to contact your provider and it comes with the tool to do it at home . I would recommend this because it won‚Äôt add extra fees because of the update and you won‚Äôt have to pay it off on your phone bill

It‚Äôs enclosed and has a built in screen protector.

Well this is NOT a waterproof case and if it was it would be heavier and bulkier. I‚Äôm wondering how that much moister is getting in ther in the 1st place. Are you bathing with it? Tip: instead of drenching the phone with cleaning solution then wiping it up, try spraying the cleaning solution on the rag itself (just enough to coat it) then use that to clean the screen.Another reviewer stated the back falls off. If you don‚Äôt snap it in correctly this will happen. Solution: go to an arts and crafts store or fabric store and ask for some double sided hem tape. It‚Äôs very thin and extremely strong. It will keep that back on if it‚Äôs a defect.

  According to the product description: ""Fully unlocked and compatible with any carrier of choice (e.g. AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint, Verizon, US-Cellular, Cricket, Metro, etc.)."" That is not true. Tried to swap out phone with Sprint (Why would I use the Sprint network??? That is a question I am asking myself as well. Terrible coverage and terrible customer service but that is a separate topic. And for the record, I'm not a negative person. I have nothing but positive things to say about Verizon where I have my business line.) Anyway, frustrating experience to get a phone that is not unlocked to any carrier as advertised and now have to go through the return process and find a new phone. Based on other reviews it appears this would work with AT&T or T-Mobile. The phone did arrive in great condition and if I was using this as a decoration or ornament I would certainly keep it. But as I would prefer to use it to text and make phone calls, I will be returning it.

  I just bought This iPhone 7 unlock. I have made the purchase on the 14th of January 2021 and had just received the iPhone on 26th of January 2021 I‚Äôve paid $77.86 to clear the phone. When I received the phone it was dead so I put it on charge with the charger that came with the phone and the charger was not working so I had to use an old iPhone charger I had here. The phone finally came on for me to set up my iCloud. While setting up my iCloud it carry me to a page to load all my information so I rest the phone down so it can finish load all my information. When I went back to the phone I noticed that it was turned off so i tried turning it back on with the power button and it did came on so I unplugged the charger and plugged it back in and leave the phone, the phone came back on put my fingerprint on to unlock it and it didn‚Äôt recognize my fingerprint so tried to put in my passcode and noticed the screen was not working. I emailed the people to put in my complaint before leaving a negative reply and no one replied to my email. I‚Äôm advising everyone not to waste your hard working money. I had to carry the phone to a technician here to fix it and he told me the screen was not the original screen and had to pay an extra 75$ to get it fix.

  I waited several months before transferring the data from my iPhone 6 Plus because I was reluctant to give up its larger screen. But not being able to update its iOS convinced me to take the plunge, and I'm glad I did. My ""new"" iPhone 7 was still in the nice box in which it was shipped and was in perfect condition. With newer models going for $600+, I'm thrilled to have gotten an upgrade that does everything I need for less than $200. I definitely recommend Techlobby to anyone seeking a good deal.

  This was a Christmas gift for my daughter. She has Verizon. We went to 2 different Verizon stores to get her iphone 5s switched to this phone, iphone7. Both stores said that the phone was locked and they were unable to transfer her account. They said it needed to be unlocked by the original carrier (whoever the hell that is). What a headache! We went to my carrier, AT&T, and crossed our fingers that they would be able to transfer the account. Thank goodness they could, because by the time we had an opportunity to get this taken care of our 90 day guarantee has expired. So all in all, my daughter had to switch carriers in order to get this phone working. It worked out in the end, but it was quite an annoyance getting to that point. The phone itself seems to be working fine at this point, but not enough time has passed to really know that for sure since all this happened today.

  At first I noticed the phone's touch screen didn't work as well as my iPhone 6. Calibration was a little off, sometimes dead spots. I thought maybe it was a quirk of having a lot of apps transferred over so I just lived with it. Then I dropped it once, not a big drop. The screen didn't break, but afterwards the vibration became unacceptably loud. Then the second time I dropped it the screen cracked. Seeing as this was the result of my own clumsiness I ordered a new screen and vibration unit and went to work repairing it. When I opened it I noticed a screw was missing on the existing vibration unit. It became apparent this phone wasn't just a repackaged return, it had significant and sloppy repairs done to it.After that I wound up getting a brand new phone of the exact same specs, iPhone 7 128G and it is like night and day! The brand new phone only cost $100 more than this piece of junk. I will never buy another refurbished phone again.

  I‚Äôm returning this item as the battery from the get go did not last long at all. It would be at 50% after using it for an hour or two. It would also do weird things like be at 40%, then I‚Äôd turn it off and then back on and it would be at 80%. It sometimes will shut off when the battery is at 20%. The last thing it started doing was the touch screen doesn‚Äôt work sometimes and sometimes it scrolls or zooms in when I‚Äôm not even touching the screen at all.

  I had been wanting a rose gold iphone for years, at first I was gonna go with the 6s because it has the headphone jack, but the battery was the only issue for me, the 6s plus has a bigger battery but then I decided on more updated, hoping it wouldn‚Äôt be more than $250, after hours of searching, I found this one; iPhone 7, rose gold, 128gb, for $177, I went through the reviews of the seller, more good than bad, so I ordered it. Ordered on Friday, delivery for Thursday, but it came a day early, I was happy ( even though I had to deal with fedex because of delivery issue ), I was nervous that I would get a beat up phone and that the battery would be horrible and that I was gonna have to send it back, but it came with an 88% battery capacity, which I was surprised, it has a few scratches that are very small but can be covered with a case, I didn‚Äôt see any scratches on the Apple logo, the screen has no scratches, I just put a screen protector on it, the charging brick looks new lol, but the charging cord is the original and brand new because it came in its original packaging. Overall a great buy.For those who give negative reviews about minor scratches on the screen or huge scratches, dents, or breaks or it‚Äôs popping up no matter how many times you pop it back in, or the charging port isn‚Äôt working just send the phone back or ask for a refund, for minor scratches around the edges or the back just put a case on.

I received it when I was told I was going too and I was pretty excited. I turn it on on the charger and transferred all the data from my 6. Then, when it was all transferred, I noticed that the battery on the 7 was low. As I have been using it the battery life in the phone is the same as my 6 and I‚Äôm constantly having to charge it.

My beef is, instead of asking for my icloud password (which made me very suspicious), they could have sent me instructions on what they wanted to do in my icloud account and i would have taken care of it.  The guy told me i sent them back a usless brick, true but i was returning the brick they sent me.  So while we worked it out finally, their attitude was business only, like it was my fault. they never did reply to why the phone wouldn't activate.ps. wife ordered another refurbished phone from another vendor, worked no problems.

  Always go with the refurbished phones on Amazon. Good value for the money. Nice phone, works well, better camera. I did not like that for it being refurbished that a brand new battery was not installed. It did have 95% life but I think that a new battery should always be part of the refurbishing. It should come with 100% life. Otherwise no complaints

  I bought a refurbished iPhone 7 in September, it worked great for 4 or so months, then the first week of January, the battery stopped working entirely. It was in a life proof case for it's entire life, never got wet, never got dropped, just one day decided to only charge to 1% and die immediately after being unplugged.Yes, I've tried different charger bases, cables, etc. The batteries they use to refurbish these things must just be very low quality.

The screen is main way of interacting with the device and it will effect watching movies.Amazon states: ""Amazon Renewed is your trusted destination for pre-owned and refurbished products that are inspected and tested to work and look like new."" and ""The products will have minimal to no signs of wear, no visible cosmetic imperfections when held 12 inches away . . ."".

    Perfect condition - Great value

  I'm cheap.  That's why I was in the market for a (Renewed) iPhone.  I'm not a phone junkie; I don't need the newest tech.  I simply wanted a cellular phone that was reliable and would be supported, reliably, for the next couple of years.  Android phones have let me down in several ways over the past few years.  Nothing worth a long tirade, but enough to make me willing to try the iOS.Wish I had done it years ago.  Value is the biggest point here.  For the same price as a brand new, 2019, A10e or a Stylo 5 with 16gb, I received a like-new 128gb iphone.  Unlike the Stylo or A10e, it will not need to be replaced in 2-3 due to it turning into a nice paper weight.  I won't go into greater detail here; my personal arguments for and against are the same as most of you.  This is not a debate forum.I received the phones - I bought two - within Amazon's 2-day shipping timeframe, even at the height of Christmas season.  Thanks, Amazon!  They were in great physical shape.  No scratches, not even small ones that were noticeable but forgivable.  Battery was at 84% on one, 80% on the other (capacity, not charged to).  Both have been exceptional thus far.  Have had them and used both for one month at the time of this writing.I have had an interaction with the 3rd party seller also.  Long story short, the issue was in an OS update, not the actual phone.  Battery life showed 5% after a full night's charge.  Turns out the battery was not draining quickly, the icon had a glitch.  Fixed easily after exploring Apple forums for two minutes.  An e-mail response was received within 2 days of notifying the 3rd party company, through Amazon.  The response, essentially, was, ""have it fixed by a certified Apple technician, send us the bill, and we'll be glad to reimburse you.""  Very pleased.  Will not hesitate to purchase products from this retailer, through Amazon, in the future.

  It came in the mail, one day late, I might add. I got it, completely content with my purchase. It looked completely new, no imperfections whatsoever. I set it up, unwrapped everything that came with it and was seeing the different features. As I opened the camera, the front view was perfectly fine, nothing wrong and then I turned the camera to take a picture of the wall to see quality and so forth and it couldn't focus, it was shaking uncontrollably. It was frustrating because my old phone had broken and I needed a new phone ASAP. I thought, buying this phone that I'd have a phone after 2 days but NOPE, I ended up returning that and bought another one from the same company...I'm hoping that I get lucky with this new one coming but if not, I will be very disappointed in this seller (...well more that i already am)

  I've learned my lesson not to trust the 1-star reviews on products like this, because this phone is AMAZING!!! I received it earlier than expected and it came with an Apple charging cable/block as well as the phone. The phone itself is in pretty good condition, it had a little bit of dustiness around the camera (as if it had a case on before) and there are a few light scratches around the top and bottom edges, but I don't think that matters much since my case covers it just fine (plus it's black so like... who cares). The phone also came with a glass screen protector already on it, which was awesome! The screen is great, volume works fine, all the buttons work, makes calls fine, runs all the apps I need it to (twitter, facebook, outlook, chrome, etc.) I saw a couple reviews complaining that this phone was bad because it didn't work on Verizon, but the listing outright SAYS it doesn't work with Verizon, it doesn't work with CDMA networks, of which Verizon is one. I have AT&T and this phone works perfectly on my network.Anyways, if you're on the fence, I say go for it! Even if you get a dud, it's backed by Amazon so you can return it. It's a win either way!

  I began using Smartphones when homeless several yrs ago. Either Samsung or LG, & it was an ""Obama"" phone, or George Bush (receiving Food Stamps made anyone qualified). So having a connection to 911 was a really important utility. Nowadays my Smartphone collection has both one refined version of Android/Samsung, & another pretty cheap Samsung. I guess Apple has been known to provide Tier 1 software & updates, so buying my iPhone 7 was because I finally decided an American company (although assembly for iPhones takes place largely in China) might handle private data in a more understandable way. Software updates for this old version won't last that many more years, but the price of the ""renewed"" phone is also worth the more exact manufacturing result (the touch-screen really is user friendly), & anyone will like aluminum cases. Android software has a lot of programmers & I don't think they are as easily integrated; Samsung needs a lot of user data just to enable you to do some important things with its Android, so like Windows, each company interfaces with one another easily or not so much. Android is better with Window tethering for phone apps, but Apple is dependable as a stand-alone system, & works with Windows if you're mostly tethering.

  Perfect phone to upgrade a iPhone 6S that was damaged. Works just as good as new with only a few scratches and scuffs on the back that nobody sees anyways with a case on it. Received in a few days from FedEx. Sure beats paying full price for a new phone. Refurbished is the way to go.  Purchase from a seller that has a solid track record based on reviews.

    Great value, be prepared to replace the battery (but worth it!)
  
",5.0,Lauren Makholm,"Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I‚Äôve been using my new old iPhone for about two weeks and can say categorically that this is a great value. Are you purchasing the latest and greatest? Absolutely not (but you knew that already). Is the phone in great shape? It really is. A very, very minor scratch on the screen that is unnoticeable when the screen is lit is the only cosmetic callout that I have (and it really is minor).One thing that you should absolutely be prepared to do when buying this phone is to replace the battery. My phone arrived with a 79% max capacity, which translates into a much reduced carrying capacity and some reduced performance. If you‚Äôre able to plug your phone in all day then maybe this won‚Äôt be an issue for you. As someone who lives in a large metropolitan area and takes the train to and from work, I need a little more flexibility, so I decided  to replace the battery for $50 at my local Apple store and it made all the difference (from both a performance and longevity standpoint). That paired with Mint Mobile has reduced my all-in mobile costs to soooo much less than where I was previously that I honestly have no idea why everyone isn‚Äôt doing the same.TL/DR If you don‚Äôt need a phone with seven cameras and are prepared to make the additional investment in a new battery then this phone is for you. I‚Äôm pairing with Mint Mobile and I couldn‚Äôt recommend enough (don‚Äôt listen to the dummies who didn‚Äôt check whether their phone would work with their carrier ‚Äî yes, you should do that prior to purchasing but don‚Äôt let it be a barrier)

  The description on this item reads: ""Renewed products work and look like new.""It did not, the iPhone had a serious dent in one corner and some scuffs near the camera, the screen was also scratched, which had to be a really hard fall to be able to scratch an iPhone's screen.The battery life is also down to 85%, which means I'll probably have to replace it in 4 or 6 months.I know I was buying a used item but it is clearly stated, to this date, that it will look and work like new. Excuse me but I've never seen a dented or scratched new iPhone nor one with a worn battery in my life.Other than that it works fine I guess, the touch screen starts freaking out from time to time, but I think that's an iPhone problem as it also happened randomly with my previous 6S.If you're looking for an iPhone that looks and works like a new one, pass on this one, just get a new one, it's worth it. I'm very careful with my stuff so a hard dent on the corner really made me hate this purchase.I'm never again, in my life, buying a ""renewed"" item from Amazon as they allegedly certify this item to meet certain standards, which must be really low.

  The phone is really nice.  Only issue is volume doesn't seem to go to 100% for incoming calls (on speaker is fine).

  Starting off, when i first received the phone it had a lot of labels on the packaging, exterior plastic and on the device itself, all with different mismatching info on them. One label for a 32GB iPhone 7, and 2 other labels for a 128GB iPhone 7 (which I ordered the 128GB model..), besides this little confusing part, I still got what I paid for, an iPhone 7 128GB. Presentation of device was fine, I didn't like the sheet of glass that was added onto my phone so that was quickly taken off. With sheet of glass off (or glass screen protector) there are some minor scuffs all around the glass of the device... which is to be expected, it's used (no s--- sherlock). Battery health upon arrival (July 10th 2020) reported 92% health remaining, which to my expectations was pretty f------ awesome ESPECIALLY for the fact that this is being sold as a renewed device. Needless to say the battery is degrading quick... also expected, but even though I have the more power intensive features turned off it's still degrading at a quick pace. I mean $49 to have apple replace a phone battery? Why not? Currently battery health reports 89% max capacity as of September 2nd 2020.

  I'm not sure why there are so many negative reviews. I received exactly what i was expecting, hardly any wear n tear even though it is a refurb item. it looks brand spankin new. it was the exact model listed and is a global unlocked model that works with gsm and cdma. battery life is a smudge below 100% in the settings. i'm glad i ignored all the reviews and just ordered anyway. 128gb iphone 7 for the price is even better then paying for insurance monthly and making a claim. Thank you!

  I ordered this phone to replace my daughters phone. Shipping was relatively quick...however the phone itself had a recall. It was a Sprint phone which is what I needed. Sprint could not connect it, despite a new SIM card which I had to order and wait an additional 3 days for. Turns out that the model number for this phone had an Apple recall. My option was to go to Apple store and have them repair. With the coronavirus, very few stores were open and I could not schedule an appointment. After a week of trying to do everything in my power, I had to return the phone to the seller.

  So I bought this phone because it was Verizon compatible. I live a very busy lifestyle and I put a screen protector on it and put it in a great case to take care of it. My current phone was still working and I was having a little bit of trouble switching it to be my main phone. No worries, the phone is in great condition and I can't get to the Verizon store anytime soon... I'll wait to make it my main phone. ... Well it turns out the phone DOESNT work with Verizon.

  I dropped my old phone in the water when I went kayaking this weekend.  So I was in market for a new phone, went with the Iphone 7 for the best value and the water resistance rating of IP67.  It was sent to me with two day shipping, via USPS arrived in my mailbox. I had it set up with no issues through AT&T within 10 minutes.  THIS IS AT&T GSM ONLY PHONE.  Which was clearly labeled in the description.  A major concern for people is the how much has the battery been used or depreciated from prior use.  You can find this out in Iphone settings very easily.  My arrived with 91% of full capacity.  Which when you consider it is a 2-3 year old used/renewed product, that is great.  It came with an installed screen protector.  Which great because I also want one on there but have a lot of trouble putting them on without air bubbles.  Lighting cable and genic charger were also included.  Very pleased to have my phone back up and running on the first try.  I think that everyone is a little intimated about buying used phones, mixed reviews, bad reviews.  I couldn't be happier with this purchase.  I'll write a follow up review after I have had it for 6-8 months after having it to show how the battery and phone hold up.(Over a year later addition to review.)  This came with a screen protector applied which at the time thought okay the seller slapped on a cheap screen protector cool.  I have always used a otterbox defender series case because I am that guy, the guy who drops everything all the time.  I decided to lean up so as to be more comfortable in my pocket and travels.  I went with the Commuter series by Otterbox.  It took a drop after using it for about year, I thought that i had cracked the screen, when i felt the corner it had dropped on it had little sharp pieces of glass on it.  So i have been going with the thought process that i cracked the screen and the screen protector is keeping the screen attached and in tact.  So for the last serval Months I assumed that it was just a matter of time until the crack grew and the phone screen was eventually be on its way out.  Today i picked at the corner a little bit just to see what would happen.  As i pull up, it cracks further, as I look its actually all the screen protector itself.  It was on of those really nice like glass screen protectors that the seller or vendor had put on and it ended up saving my phone in the long run.  So that little extra ended up saving the day and when I bought it i didn't even know it was there for the most part.  Excellent thanks for have that preinstalled, who knows what could have happened if i had lagged on that.

  First iPhone 7 order  arrived on time, had no scratches or any cosmetic damage, IOS not up to date and device screen started pixeling, really pretty obvious, even though box indicated it was ""Refurbished"" and ""Rigourously Tested"", ""Updated with New Software"".  After much discussion with hard to understand Amazon support reps, I negotiated an immediate gift credit, since I paid via cash on a debit card, and thus ordered a replacement the same day, while the first was sent back to initial supplier (DealFisher),  (Otherwise Amazon returns menu note suggested it would have taken 7 days to get credit).Second iPhone arrived a few days later from BUYSPRY, sooner than expected. It had a few very small nicks on the metal case, and nearly invisible hairline scratches on screen corner, and was not up to date on IOS, but did update. Seems to perform well so far (2 days in use) as expected after activating. Battery showed 85% capacity on IOS Beta Battery Health, but seems to hold a charge all day. Will give it a try and see what happens, have 30 days to return and 90 days warranty. Also, purchased 2 year square trade warranty.

  The model A1660 has a known issue that the modem goes out. Will not connect to cellular network. Since it is refurbished it is out of the coverage time for it to be repaired for free and Apple will charge you $300 to repair. The phone functioned fine but they are a time bomb. They will go out at any time and while everything else works fine it will no longer with any carrier. Look up iPhone 7 Carrier service failed to update. So buy at your own risk.

  iPhones are pretty well-known now, and this is a good, hardworking member of that family. The one thing about buying them online is that there are special compatibility issues that I've run into from time to time. It may say it's a Verizon phone (or whatever carrier), but if it doesn't meet their compatibility requirements around the IMEI, it won't work. That can be checked on the Carrier's website, if the seller will give that to you. Otherwise, it'll be a 50/50 shot of getting the right phone, in my experience.

  The phone sent was in excellent condition, however it was an AT&T unlocked phone which uses the GSM standard and not the CDMA standard.  The Apple spec page indicates that the Intel-powered A1778 and A1784 phones won't support CDMA (or code division multiple access), a cellular technology used on some LTE networks. That means an Intel-powered iPhone 7 simply won't work on CDMA networks, such as Verizon's and Sprint's.

  I ordered the phone for my daughter in August. Everything came fast and worked fine. Two days after the warranty expired is when we started to experience battery issues (how Convenient). My daughter kept her phone on the charger all night and it went from 3% to 1%. Now I have an upset 8 year old and no phone. A phone should last way longer than three months without expiriencing these type of problems! Very upsetting!

The renewed phone I received looked good, some very faint scratches on the apple logo but I‚Äôm okay with that as I did not expect to receive a brand new phone. I had an issue with a defective charger and so I contacted them. Responses were quick and the replacement charger arrived quickly. Also, it comes with a 90 day warranty, which is fair.

  I purchased this phone and all was ok for a while, after a month or two it suddenly couldn't connect to wifi anymore, due to a protracted illness i couldn't do anything about it at the time. recently i took it to the closest apple store after being pointed there by my provider noticed it was one of a number that were recalled for just this problem. The serial number was clear on it and this is one of the problem phones so they should have been aware of the problem. apple refuses to fix it because they claim it was sold as an "" as is ""phone despite being their defect and the company saying they were recalled, the repair price is more than I paid for the phone so now I am stuck with a very expensive paperweight.

  The description is misleading: ""Renewed products look and work like new"".Drilling down into the details of Amazon renewed / refurbished phones yields the info that the policy actually only guarantees the battery to have something like 80% of the original capacity.A device that ""works like new"" would have a battery that is 100% of a new battery capacity.  80% of a new battery capacity is not ""like new"".Additionally, my phone was not fully functional.  My callees repeatedly could barely hear me on speakerphone.  Even Apple support said it was not functioning correctly when I called for help with troubleshooting.  So, obviously the phone was not adequately ""inspected and tested by Amazon-qualified suppliers"".Amazon refunded the purchase, but for the hassle of having to test and diagnose the phone myself, a substandard warranty period, a ""less than new"" battery, missing headphone adapter, and a return, to me it's worth just buying the phone from Apple.

  The phone came in much better quality than I thought it would. They got the color and storage right, and it was incredibly easy to transfer data from one phone to another, just like buying from Apple. The differences are that the charger and adapter are off brand and don't really work (easy fix: just buy another from absolutely anywhere), the screen came with a few 'scratches' (not deep or anything, just apparent marks when you look at it), some dead pixels in the middle of the screen and one ACTUAL scratch that makes me more nervous about the screen cracking. It doesn't come with a screen wipe or anything, but you can also get those easily. In the package is a little SIM card pick, which is especially helpful and something lots of people forget to throw in (Apple doesn't even send one). Overall, the phone is nice where it matters, but has small issues one can't help but notice.

  These folks are selling phones that have broad recall due to a bad mother board. According to apple models A1660 should not have been resold when apple pulled them from the shelf. 2 weeks after the 90 return policy (of course) my son's phone began exhibiting the classic issues directly related to the recall. When inquiring/appealing with the seller they told us there was nothing they could/would do and suggested we take it to a local repair store. Super discouraging. My 12 year old son worked really hard this summer mowing lawns to purchase this POC. It's a tough lesson to learn that some people/businesses operate this way.

La verdad me decepcion√≥ porque la persona a qui√©n le regale ya tiene un iPhone 7 solo cambio el calor. No lo puedo devolver porque ya lo di como regalo. Espero que el vendedor sea m√°s serio con los env√≠os que les solicita sus clientes.

    ... phone to upgrade from my old 5S I absolutely love it! However I am not able to use ...
  
",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2018","









  
  
    
  I  originally bought this phone to upgrade from my old 5S I absolutely love it!  However I am not able to use it with Verizon  as the description states!  Was hoping I would be able to because some of the other reviews  said that it would work with Verizon but,  mine doesn't  also it would be  Smart to pay attention to the seller.  I bought mine from dealFisher.  The reason I'm not going to return this is 1 because  i'm absolutely in love with the phone .  The camera is awesome and the sound is awesome.  And 2  because I already bought a phone case for it. Every gigabyte I ordered is on there  and the phone was exactly as described. So,  I guess I'll use this phone for Facebook  and use my old 5S as just a phone.  I would suggest if you're on Verizon don't buy this phone  unless you're using it for social media and things of that nature.  If anything changes I'll come back and update this review.

  When I received the phone it only had 73% of the battery health, the advertised battery health was supposed to be at less 80%. The phone goes into limp mode and it was slow and unresponsive, I try charging the phone and it took almost a day for it to fully charge and loose charge by the end of day without using. So I decided to return the phone. The phone was not refurbished it was just repackage from multi return. I don't normally review my purchase but this seller is not refunded my return after receiving my product.

  Phone worked well, no issues there.  They are not kidding about the battery capacity being at least 80%.  That's exactly what mine was.  This phone is for my son and the battery barely lasts 6 hours..  I've bought a new battery and a water tight seal and I will install myself.  Just letting people know they may need to spend an additional $35 for a new battery if they get a phone like a weak battery like mine.I struggled with the rating because this product is exactly what the seller said it would be.  Giving 3 stars so people might notice this review and know they will likely get a weak battery and have to take additional steps to replace it like me.

  I bought this phone in July 2019 for $215 from Kiss 3Ply. It is beautiful. It has worked perfectly ever since. I've had it for almost a year and love it. I had an LG before that , and liked it except that the phone part was terrible! No one could hear or understand me unless I was on speakerphone. The iPhone phone is excellent! So is the camera, battery, everything, except the Bluetooth, which I don't really care about anyway. It didn't work easily so I didn't bother to figure out why.  I had to buy an adapter to use my earbuds, and I recommend the Ugreen adapter, for about $20. It's worth it!

  The phone arrived with one tiny scuff on the top edge, but looked great besides that.  Apple will charge you for that little scratch if you ever need to send it in for repair using the replacement program.  This phone has so many problems turning off and on on it's own.  Now it will not connect to my cellular service and confirmed to be a problem with the iphone.  This 90-day warranty is the only time period where this phone is sure to be usable.  After any iphone is 2 years old from brand new, Apple admittedly intentionally programs all Iphones to weaken and even become possibly completely unusable ""to save the battery"" according to Apple.  It is a total waste of money to buy an Iphone if you want it to last longer than 2 years from brand new.  Battery life is poor, phone breaks very easily if barely dropped, If an update is failing, you will have to use an apple/Mac PC to get the proper updates as it is intentionally designed to only work with other Apple stuff.  Pathetic.  Any Android will likely be a better choice.

Little did I know that a certain model of this phone that was built in China would start rejecting my sim card. Every so often it would tell me that I had no service. I would take the same SIM card out and put it in another phone and it would work just fine. Please make sure you research the model and where it's made so that you don't end up like me spending money on a phone that doesn't work. Even when I took the phone to the iPhone store they said I was not eligible to get the phone recalled or even fixed. Such a waste.

I hope on future refurbs that the company tests battery life before selling. The battery drains when not being used so the issue would have been easily identifiable.

MobileSpree had some decent reviews, so I took a chance.*The Phone*Arrived in a box that said ‚Äòdon‚Äôt bother stealing me, there‚Äôs nothing interesting in here‚Äô. Nothing but the phone and a 3rd party charger - but both were in great shape. Setup was painless on Mint Mobile. Battery health was 85% which seems reasonable for a refurbished iPhone 7. Works well.*Customer Service / The Seller*The phone started getting hot while using it with the charger plugged in. I asked the seller what was up with this, and got very prompt responses and a heads up that that is a no-no generally for iPhone 7s.Overall 4/5 - if you‚Äôre skeptical of buying a renewed iPhone on Amazon I‚Äôd recommend MobileSpree.This review will be updated if it all goes belly up.

  The phone was beautiful!  My daughter loaded her apps and contacts onto the phone, connected it to WiFi, and was excited to start using the phone.

When she took it to Verizon, she was told that the iPhone 7 is notorious for having this problem.  We've had the phone 24hrs now and MyWit quickly issued a RMA.  I would have rather exchanged the phone but that was not an option.  I looked at the MyWit inventory and the phone was available for sale, but it was more expensive.  So, it's now 1 week until Christmas and my $320 is tied up with MyWit until they issue a refund (2-3 days after receipt) which means she won't have a Christmas present.  -_-Update:  Phone sent back today.  The RMA / return label were confusing though.

  A month ago my phone was stolen and I needed a new phone. I ordered the Apple iPhone 7, Fully Unlocked, 128GB - Rose Gold (Refurbished) from Amazon. It came with scratches and one speaker didn't work. I thought I would keep it anyway, but then it had trouble connecting to tmobile, my carrier. After two days it connected and I had service. Then the phone died and again, it wouldn't connect to service for another two days. This happened every time the phone died or went on airplane mode. Until it stopped connecting altogether. As you can imagine this was a big headache, not having a functioning phone all of the time.I finally gave in and ordered the same product again from a different seller. I was excited to get the phone, although I had to go to the post office because Fed Ex wouldn't drop it off.But the new phone wouldn't set up at all!It came in a box that said it was locked with Verizon and when I tried to set it up it said ""this phone cannot be set up""I finally went and bought a new phone straight from Tmobile and now have no problems.Here's my advice: Save yourself the hassle, spend an extra hundred dollars and get a new, not ""refurbished"" phone.

  Problems with the phone straight out of the box!! I noticed the tempered glass screen protector on the phone was cracked in no less than 3 places, but having never ordered a ""refurbished"" phone before I just assumed that was something that came with the territory. That was until less than 2 WEEKS pass and I now have a, basically, useless phone on my hands!!!! The battery dies 1-2% EVERY 60 SECONDS! So within an hour, the phone needs to be charged AGAIN! The original charger that came with the phone only lasted about 5 days before it started needing to be held in a certain position the entire time, just to charge. Buying a new charger helped somewhat (not with the battery life), however, the charging port is showing signs that its on its last leg. I've had similar issues in the past with other (much longer used phones) phones. And every time, the charging port just stops working all together. I'VE HAD THE PHONE FOR 2 1/2 WEEKS!!!!! THAT'S IT!!!!! And I'm already dealing with a phone that has MAYBE 30 days left before it graduates to its next role in this life...... which is.... A PAPER WEIGHT!!!! I know the phones refurbished, but 200+$ is a lot of money to spend (for me) on something that's only going to ""work"" for 5 weeks! I say ""work"" because the definition of the word doesn't really apply to this phone.

Everything was fine, phone was in great working order until the past month or so (5 mo. mark) when the battery  would drop drastically and soon, my phone had to be plugged into a power source to even turn on. Now, it does not turn on at all, even when plugged into a power source.I contacted the seller and was told it is not their problem as ""we have no way of knowing when issues will arise"" and there is only a 90 day warranty, aka just enough time that once it breaks you are right outside the warranty.I would not recommend this phone or seller, it is a cheap refurbishment that will break in less than a year, and possibly a scam completelyBetter to spend ~$80-$100 more from a better seller.

  We purchased this product in December as a Christmas present for my son. We paid several hundred dollars for what we thought was a quality refurbished phone. After about six months, the phone started glitching but nothing serious. Now, less than 9 months after the purchase, he is unable to use cellular data or use the phone to make calls. When I contacted them about this, they said, there is nothing they can do since the warranty only covered the first six months. While I knew we were not purchasing a new phone, I still expected it to last more than 9 months given the cost. I will never purchase a product from Kanga again!

I had an issue with the battery life and after contacting the seller, they advised me to send it back to them for inspection. They always took ownership and explained to me it was operating at 80-85% capacity, which was normal given it was a renewed phone. I thanked them and asked that the phone be returned to me and I would pay the postage. The phone was promptly returned at their expense. I am beyond pleased with my purchase and especially impressed with their rapid responses to every question I presented. I think they went above and beyond to accommodate me.

We shall see overtime how the battery holds up.

",2.0,Grace Gearhardt,"Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2019","









  
  
    
  I ordered the iPhone 7 in gold. It worked for the first day. However, within 24 hours I was experiencing errors with updates and connection. The phone claimed that it had NOT been updated and disabled me from accessing cellular data, or sending/receiving calls. The device itself was in great condition, but did not function as a cell phone.I had tried updating, backing up, and completely restoring the phone several times using iTunes through my laptop.. but the error notifications persisted. This purchase is a hit or miss.. perhaps the phone I received had not been refurbished properly. I would recommend buying an Apple-certified refurbished phone before going through other buyers. You just never know what you're going to get through other companies.

  I ordered 2 phones with this seller. They came on time and well packaged. I have noticed batter life is not the greatest it only lasts half the day unless recharged, but that is how it works with iPhones so it was to be expected. One of the phones has an issue with the camera not focusing unless you close app several times & reopen. Absolutely no problems with the touch screen at all it works perfectly. Also both were ready to step up & half way charged when they arrived. Only real complaint I would have is both chargers have stopped working in the matter of 2 weeks. Both have been plugged into the wall outlet, phones have not be in use while one charger either. No misuse of chargers at all & they both have completely stopped working. I would purchase from this seller again in the future as long as chargers were better quality.

  This phone looks and acts new with one exception. The battery life is abysmal. Apple showed me how to see my battery health and actually did a remote phone ""health check"" which indicated a battery capable of charging up to about 85%. The issue is the rapid discharge rate. Just sitting idle next to me the battery typically goes from 100% to about 60% in four hours or so- again, while sitting essentially dormant. Apple will replace it for $49 but I don't feel I should have to take a phone that is inspected and sold as like new and immediately perform maintenance on my end. Maybe Amazon would like to split the cost of replacement with me? Sure don't want to have to return it and go through authorizing/ activating another phone! Yikes!

I didn't bother trying to charge it so I don't know if it will power on. It is so scratched up that it's useless anyway. There is the typical screen protection film on it so, at first, I could only see ow dinged up the back was. That was really disappointing by itself. Then I remove the film and, OMG, the screen was a mess. You can very easily see the damage at way more than arm's length.

The best part was i ordered a 32GB model and they ended up sending me a 128GB model.The main reason I gave this review 2 stars is because of the battery life. It could hardly hold a charge. I checked the battery health in the setting on the phone and it said 63%. Batters severally degrade. My battery only lasted me about 4 hours total before it need charging.

I tried again and basically the phone has turned into a paperweight.  So, I got from September to almost April with it. I give it two stars for that.....buyer beware....a refurbished phone may be great.....may be OK....or it may be bad.

  I bought this product for someone overseas.  I trusted it because of the Amazon Renewed guarantee.  Before leaving the country, I powered the phone up but nothing else.  Fortunately I was very clear with the recipient that the phone was second hand.  Upon receipt, the new owner found the camera did not work.  In time this was joined by the main button, the sim card connection, and more.  A local Apple certified repair specialist said the phone had been stripped and filled with knock-off parts, poorly installed.  He offered $10 for the shell.  By this time I had continued my travels and was no longer in the vicinity of the phone, so I had no opportunity to bring the phone back and return it.  I suspect the Amazon seller, SupremeDealsCR, of behavior ranging between bad faith and outright fraud.  I think the Amazon Renewed guarantee is worth nothing but a guarantee that you will engage with their returns department.  A total disaster.

    Japan Model iPhone
  
",1.0,Olivia,"Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  This phone was not as described at all. When I went looking for a fully unlocked iPhone 7, I was specifically looking for an A1660 model, and that‚Äôs what the page said. When I recieved the phone it worked fine at first, but later in the evening when I was adjusting the audio from the phone, I couldn‚Äôt mute the shutter - no matter what I tried. I did some googling, and one suggestion on an apple forum said that Japan & Korean model phones cannot mute the shutter sound. They have privacy laws in those countries, due to excess upskirt photos. I went into the about setting in the phone and saw that the model number ended in J/A, a Japan model phone. Here in the US having your shutter noise not muted is socially unacceptable. I think it is dishonest advertising on their part, obviously a Japan model phone is going to be cheaper, because nobody wants that extra restriction, and they were charging just as much as other iPhones that were completely unlocked. The whole experience was awful.

  I needed a heftier phone rather than my iPhone6, but I didn‚Äôt want a huge screen or a $1000 price. I ran into a difficult problem that high level Apple support eventually solved.  This was a configuration issue because of the multiple Apple products used in my phone. This would have happened even if I had bought the most expensive new iPhone. It was difficult to eliminate the phone itself and the carrier as issues. The point here is that Apple rendered first class support free for a used phone. The basic installation was easy and fast. The phone appears as if it were new, and I saved a lot.

  I got this iPhone 7 32gb gold, as a gift not expecting a new phone as it had a small scuff on the top left which I can live with but could of done with out... just my luck. My main issue with the product is if you are claiming something is renewed or refurbished and amazon is putting their name behind it it should be just that. The ear speaker where you put your ear to listen was full of dried up crud from god knows what, I assume it was a mixture of pocket lint and ear sweat that I had to carefully scrape off with a tool. Just to be able to see the actual mesh screen underneath and get good sound quality. That was not the only location where a had to do this procedure as the bottom speakers/mic area also had this gross crud covering the screen and affecting the sound quality. All the little circles had to be cleaned out just to see the mesh screen underneath and get better sound not to mention the lighting plug socket was also full of lint smh. Another area where I had to clean some of this same crud was on the silence button on the bottom and top of it, I could not see the red strip that lets you know the phone is on silence. I didn‚Äôt return It cause it was a gift for the same day that it arrived on, so I didn‚Äôt have that luxury, but I would of! Amazon needs to do a better job with setting standards to these third party vendors as they are tagging these items with prime shipping and warranties using the amazon brand which I‚Äôve never had an issue with till this product.

  I took my chances and ordered this phone despite all the negative reviews. It arrived on time 2 days after ordering, came with a glass screen protector already on it, a power adapter brick, and charging cord. I updated the phone to the latest iOS software using iTunes and it took a little longer than expected because the cord provided would sometimes disconnect but that's not really an issue with the phone. I work at a certified iphone repair Geek Squad, so I ran full apple diagnostics on the phone. It passed all diagnostics and the battery health was at 90% which doesn't really bother me because apple only recommends a battery replacement under 80%. No issues activating the phone through Metro PCS after providing them the IMEI number and then transferring the SIM card. The phone has a very minor ding/scratch on the bottom of the enclosure but that can be expected from a refurbished phone. Overall very happy with this purchase. I'll provide updates if something comes up though.

Phone worked flawlessly out of the box until I inserted my sim and found out that I accidentally purchased an AT&T phone instead of a GSM unlocked phone.  Also came with new charging cable and usb wall plug.  I would recommend this seller. Overall satisfied 4 stars for battery health and minor scratches.

  The phone came very quickly, with cheap shipping. When it got here it came with a charger, a SIM card key (the thing to open the slot in the phone). The thing I liked the most was that the package also came with an unused bubble wrap pack as well as a packaging label in case you needed to return the product. Phone was already charged to 20% when received, and set up easy. I‚Äôm using it to write this review and probably would have never guessed it was refurbished unless the listing said otherwise.

Be aware of models A1660 and A1780.I received the A1660 model when I purchased this phone and had to bring it to Apple and took a week to fix and they did it for free.Now the phone works wonderfully and basically brand new.

    Amazon ""Renewed"" fail. Over-promised condition.
  
",1.0,WeInSC,"Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  This review is for the Amazon ""Renewed"" program product iPhone 7 256 GB gold phone sold by JemJem & Amazon Renewed...Battery was shot.  Came completely depleted of its charge.  If you Google information on lithium ion batteries, you'll find that letting it go completely dead is a really bad thing.  The sad thing about ""renewed"" products (as opposed to Apple's own ""certified pre-owned) is that the battery isn't changed out. JemJem is particularly guilty of leaving the product in a vulnerable condition.  Apple puts a will put a new shell and battery on its refurbs.Device's screen had noticable scuff pits but when the screen is illuminated, I don't see deformation of the graphics.  As soon as you put a screen protector on it, those defects will show...  There was an inconsequential scuffing on corners but that was tolerable.  Dirty too.  Damage was easily visible at arm's length.I fully charged the iPhone 7, disconnected the power and let it sit with no functions (no Wi-Fi, no SIM card, no use, screen off).  The battery stayed at 100% for nearly 3 hours...Within 15 minutes of web news reading (no video or animated ads, etc.) The indicator was down to 89%. The battery is a bust.The Apple battery condition indicated a MAXIMUM battery capacity of 80%.  Not a minimum. The description of the Renewed products made 80% sound like a hardline minimum.I see documentation that the refurbishment (renewal) was done 12/09/2019. Just short of 3 months of my receipt.  With a shut off phone, the battery drops to 0?  That's a bad harbinger!I guess you can just plan on taking the phone you just bought to the Apple Store and pay an additional $50 for a new battery...  I'm on a budget but stuck.Also, there was dirt in the ring silencer area and around the bottom speaker holes. I was grossed out and wiped it with electronic device cleaner. Groooooossss! The charger looked a little rough but my kid won't be putting that up to her face..This was my first Amazon and Apple (renewed) purchase...  Pretty disappointing. Having bought a handful of Amazon Warehouse Returns in past years, it was hit and miss. This was definitely a miss,  One final tip...  DO NOT BE DESPERATE like we were.  If I had an additional week to buy, I wouldn't have messed around and rejected this minutes after seeing the quick battery drop.*Update:  A few days have passed... Amazon will be getting a call...  This experience will solidify my distrust of their ""renewed"" program and the vendors involved...

I then had to go a verizon store and just get a phone because I needed a phone by that time...Hear is the biggest hassle to return the phone you have to take Iphone cloud off. I couldn't do that because my phone wouldn't turn on. I called them and they sent me a link. I had to login and switch the phone to no longer in use. For most people that may not be a problem. I'm not very tech savy so again it was just more of a hassle.The company did have amazing customer service they picked up right away. That why this isn't a 1 star.

  The phone is well-functioning. The battery health is 86%. Looks like-new, no visible scratches but does have dust inside the speakers' holes and the front camera seems to have dust inside as well because the pictures are not as bright as on my wife's phone (same model). Came already with the protective glass. I had this phone for 2 weeks and overall satisfied with my purchase.

  I've bought two of these, but not for a good reason... the first one I got from a seller named BuySPRY and unfortunately it looks like they don't repair the phones they work on correctly. I didn't really take concern about this until after I spilled a glass of water on my table, some of which went onto the phone. These phones are rated IP67 water resistant, but this particular phone repaired by BuySPRY was not properly sealed.If you do a little research you find these phones require you to remove all the old adhesive between the phone screen and the phone chassis and install a fresh new one; this is one of the primary things maintaining water resistance among a few other details. Anyway this phone clearly had not had its screen adhesive replaced, there was chunks of it exposed going around the edges of the screen - which left just enough of a gap for water to ingress.The big sad thing here is this happened I'm not kidding one day after the 90 warranty ended. I contacted the seller to inform them of the problem and asked if they could do anything. They didn't at all seem concerned their phone wasn't repaired correctly, nor did they offer any form of compensation for their poorly repaired device.So I ended up buying a new one, from a different seller named Hybrid IT. It has been over a month now and I so far have had a good experience. The first phone I got had a poor health battery as indicated in iPhone battery information. I contacted the seller about it; and they immediately corrected the problem. They sent me another phone which has a 100% battery. So far this phone has been perfect and I haven't had any issues with it. I also can clearly see the screen adhesive looks like it is brand new. Hopefully this one will hold out.Moral to the story, if you at all find anything concerning with your purchase of an Amazon renewed phone... don't hesitate, don't take chances... get them to make it right. Some of us are more picky than others, but my main concerns on repaired phones are the water tight seal and the health of the battery. It is going to be very difficult to find a perfect condition used phone, so you have to pick what you care about most. Good luck!

  When I first received my phone it would sometimes lose cellular signal.  With iOS updates, or just as time passed, the issue got worse.  I googled the problem and discovered that it was included in a free repair program offered by Apple because some models had faulty components.  The repair included a battery replacement too. I'm happy with my purchase from Amazon and with my repair from Apple.  This was a nice upgrade from my iPhone SE which only had 16 gb.  The size of the iPhone 7 is very comfortable and with 256 gb I no longer have to delete some photos to make room for new ones.  The condition of the renewed iPhone was as described by Amazon.

  When we received the phone it was in great condition and worked wonderfully. However, within a few months it began randomly dropping service which would drop calls. Then, the problem progressed until the service was dropped permanently. We took the phone to the Apple store where they explained there had been a ""manufacturer defect"" with the hardware and said they would replace it. When the replacement phone came in, Apple told us they found ""other"" issues with the phone and would not replace it. With no other choice (because the phone could not be used to make or receive any calls), we had to purchase another phone from Apple. Very frustrating.

  Worked out of the box. Found it was hard to charge. Cleaned out the charging port with a toothpick and found a lot of pocket lint. Hmmmn. Not really a thorough refurbish, tho it gave me hope that the prior owner had dumped it on that issue. Battery life not great regardless.A month later it started giving a ‚Äòno cellular service‚Äô and I find on research that there is a documented factory flaw in one of the chips. By restarting the phone cell service can be restored, but an intermittent irritation. Took it into the Apple store and they found no issue, only recommended replacing the battery, which I had them do. Interestingly they charged the same as mr fixit in the strip mall. $50 gave me a phone with real battery life.The problem however continues to crop up about once a week. Apple said it was fine so they own the fix if it becomes chronic.For the price not a bad deal. Love the fingerprint entry feature.

The color seems very pale and washed out compared to my other iphones which have more bold colors4. The screen appears to have been replaced, there is a very obvious edge along where the screen meets the phone's frame. I can feel this with my fingers every time I hold the phone, my other iphones are smooth along this edge.5. Touch sensitivity is noticeably worse than my other phones.

The shutter on the camera can not be quieter or turned off like any other American model.

  After reading both terrible and great reviews for this iPhone 7, 128GB, I decided to give it a shot. It arrived 5 days before it was expected, and was sealed nicely in its own little box (albeit not an original Apple iPhone box). The phone had protective plastic on all sides and came about 30% charged. The phone had 0 scratches whatsoever, SIM card slot and insert fit perfectly. No wiggling buttons, no obvious signs of (non-original) replacement screen, buttons, etc. Aesthetically the phone is 99% clean besides just a teeny scratch on the back. Called to my service provider and had the phone 100% operational within 20 minutes.The 1 negative point I would like to make (which was clearly explained in the product description) is that they only guarantee up to 80% battery capacity. Personally, mine has 88% battery life. Keep in mind, when purchasing a refurbished iPhone, you will have some capacity lost.For $200, this phone is spot on. I recommend to anyone!

  My wife and I have iPods and iPads but have been using android cell phones for years. I wanted to switch to apple phone but with the high entry cost have waited. I decided that I wanted an iPhone 7 renewed so I check the feedback on various sellers. I chose to buy from BuySPRY and could not be more pleased. I could not find any scratches or marks anywhere on the phone. It appears to be new. The phone was unlocked so I had no trouble moving it to my old carrier. I actually use Tracfone and moving was an easy process. I highly recommend BuySPRY and will use them again when I purchase a replacement for my wife's android and she moves to iPhone.

The employee at Verizon who was trying to help me said this often happens with phones purchased on Amazon. I decided to check around and see what carrier it is compatible with, and could not find any. Do not buy this phone or any phone from Amazon, as they are not practicing truth in advertising.Edited to add: I learned now that the problem may actually be with all iphone 7. Evidently The iphone 7 had a major problem on some sort of internal chip that makes it stop reading sim cards and messes up the IEIN.

  Was a little concerned by some reviews stating this was not compatible with Verizon, this one stated that it was CDMA / GSM compatible, so took the chance - and glad I did!  It took about 10 minutes to login to Verizon account, provide the info they needed about the new phone and make the switch from my old android phone to this new (refurbished) Apple phone  - easy-peasy.  Also, as a refurbished phone, I was expecting it to have a few dings, scratches ... when I inspected it out of the box - not even 1 scratch or ding on it!  Very clean - it looks brand new!  The only thing that indicates it was pre-owned / refurbished was that it already had a screen protector on it, which I wanted anyway and now did not have to buy or hassle with putting it on.  So, overall and hopefully without jinxing my wonderful new phone (knock on wood), this was one of the best purchases I have ever made on Amazon - the phone is fantastic, works and looks great and I DID NOT have any compatibility issues with Verizon.

  I bought two phones intending to give it to my kids as a gift. Phones took a Verizon SIM card with no problem, and I confirmed that they was able to make/receive calls.  One bonus was that they both came with screen protectors already on them.  What completely ruined both phones was the battery life.  I charged both phones to full and turned them off, intending to wrap these up. When I powered them on the next day, the battery percentage was at 21% on one, and 18% on the other. On the silver one, I noticed it was blinking an Apple logo on and off every minute or so.  Mind you, this was with both phones being powered OFF.  This is downright appalling, and if it does this when the phones are OFF, then it means that the battery life when the phones are being actively used is next to nil. This is not 1980. I am not buying corded phones.  I‚Äôm giving an extra star on this review for customer service, as the seller approved the return almost immediately, and issued the refund when the products were returned.

After the update installed, the phone restarted and went to a black back-lit screen just after the apple logo appeared. I tried to do a forced reset (holding power button and volume down button for several seconds) and the same thing kept happening over and over. Apple logo popped up for a second...and then back to black screen. I dealt with Amazon troubleshooting customer service as well as Apple and I was told to just return it...so NOW I'm going to have to RETURN this item with NO ABILITY TO WIPE MY DATA FROM IT because before the black screen of death appeared, the phone had me log into my itunes account to restore a back up from the cloud.

The worst of the three is the one being reviewed here. The Battery Health feature within the iOS reports ""Your battery's health is significantly degraded"" and displays that the Maximum Capacity is 74% (down from 75% when I first received the iPhone). When I recently tested the standby time, which is supposed to be up to ten days for the iPhone 7, the result was that the battery was at 28% of capacity in two days.The Battery Health feature on the other two iPhones reports 88% and 86%, respectively.

  I bought this to replace my old iPhone 6. Old phone would drain the battery in a few hours, and would constantly lose cell signal even when I was in an area that had good service. Only way to get it working was to turn it off, drop it, and turn it back on. After replacing the battery and the cell antenna, no change. So I broke down and bought this refurbished one, and so far am very happy. Looked pretty much brand new out of the box. Battery life seems as good as a new phone, and it works perfectly. Swapping phones was easy, just updated iOS on my old phone, did an iCloud backup, powered off old phone, swapped SIM card into the new phone, went through setup, and restored from the iCloud backup. Presto, I have a newer version of my old phone, with all of my same ‚Äústuff‚Äù, and it actually works! And for far less than buying a brand new iPhone. Couldn‚Äôt be happier.

  Worked great UNTIL I updated it and the cell modem was broken. The phone couldn‚Äôt recognize some cellular part in its system so it refused to get signal or anything. It was handled by a third party so it completely screwed up the phone. Apple refused to repair it because of the third party parts in it. Waste of money. I had to buy an entirely different phone

  Pos.  I bought this assuming I was getting a decent phone just a few gens behind but the price was constant with others only.  Terrible first off I had to send it in to get it to update because something was wrong with the o/s and secondly the battery life is pure garbage not only does it only last made an hour and a half on a full charge before dying but also runs super hot.  Don‚Äôt not buy from this seller cause they clearly don‚Äôt test their products or don‚Äôt care about their customers. What a waste of $$$$200!!!!!!

  I am LIVID.I purchased this product despite negative reviews regarding the quality of their phones due to more recent positive reviews, leading me to believe perhaps they'd learned from previous bad transactions to perform every necessary quality assurance test prior to shipping their product to the buyer.With this product being a PHONE, one would think the most basic check this seller couldve done would have been to make absolutely sure this phone was able to make phone calls.First, it took 3-5 ninutes just to boot up. It was stuck on the white apple logo screen that entire time, my first indication that I was mistaken for having given this seller my benefit of the doubt.Once fully loaded, I do that very basic test one does when they acquire a new phone - I attempted a phone call.There was absolutely no audio in the receiver and on top of that, the speaker phone button was greyed out and unable to be selected as an option.So I checked all the volume settings and tried it again to no avail.I restart the phone and still no audio.I googled the problem and much to my dismay discovered that this is a common HARDWARE issue with the iphone 7s and it requires opening up tbe phone and using a soldering iron on the audio chip; in other words, not a simple software solution I can perform myself.For the life of me I cannot fathom why after so many negative reviews regarding the quality of their phones this seller would choose to not do elementary quality tests before shipping to customers or why theyd send me a defective phone that I cannot use. I am beyond upset.

All I had to do was switch over the SIM cards and just back up her old phone to her computer then just transfer everything to this phone. She absolutely loves it. Incase anyone wants to know it comes with a new charger and wall plug and a SIM card removal tool and that is it no headphones. Those are sold separately with this unless you purchase straight from Apple.  Only buy this phone if you have AT&T and this phone can‚Äôt be used for other carries it specifically says in a note card that comes with the phone

  I bought one of these phones and within a few weeks it was no longer able to make or receive a phone call. I ended up contacting the seller who told me they didn‚Äôt have one for me to exchange with and that they would allow a refund. Looking on the website there was another one for me to get so I ended up biting the bullet and just bought another of the same phone thinking I just had bad luck. I ended up having to pay $20 to ship the old phone back but at least got my refund. The second phone I bought was more expensive by $20 than the first for the same exact phone, which is probably why the seller wouldn‚Äôt exchange and lied saying they didn‚Äôt have one. The second phone I got at least works and can make calls still, but the battery is 71% unlike the 80% minimum as promised. I‚Äôm not going to lose even more money to send this back so I‚Äôll deal with the bad battery, but definitely would not recommend buying from this seller. I‚Äôve bought two phones and had poor experiences both times.

  Purchased as a backup phone for my daughter, in case the touch screen went out. The purchase price is almost equivalent to replacing the glass on the iPhone 7. Battery life is at 80% when received. Her current phone is at 84% after owning it for several years so not much difference. The generic charging cable that came with the phone does not work, at all. The wall charger is generic and works. I threw the cable away as it would not charge any iPhone we have. It says ""accessory may not be supported"" when plugged in to the XR, 8 plus and 7. Overall everything on the iOS works as usual. It did arrive completely erased, but only with 3% battery charge. The back of the phone did not have any scratches. The glass has one small scratch, but not noticeable after a screen protector is put on. After the initial start up and logging in, I made sure to update the iOS so it is current. Everything else works as it should. Pricing fluctuates constantly on these, so keep an eye on the price before purchasing. If color isn't an issue, check pricing on the other colors as well.

  I returned my iPhone7 to Amazon after 2 weeks because of repeating no service and self restart problems. I tried to fix the problem twice by restoring the phone using i-tunes. First time, the phone was having problems to activate after restore, but it was finally able to do so after a good number of tries. It worked for several days and then failed showing a permanent no service problem again. Then, I tried to restore it using i-tunes once again but this time it was not able to activate after many attempts.I found out that this was a known problem with iPhone 7‚Äôs and that there was a recall by Apple regarding this issue more than 3 years ago offering to change the logic board in all these faulty phones. So, I decided that it was better to return it.

  I have been using the phone for a few days now and it's worked fine. The only issue is with the touch screen. Since I had the same (sluggish response occasionally) issue with my last iPhone, I assume it's the design, not this particular device. Battery health is as advertised, 82%. There are a few minor cosmetic flaws, nothing really visible unless looking for them and they do not affect the operation of the phone. So, again, a few days in, I am satisfied with the phone.

  Received prompt delivery of the phone. I inserted my 'sim card' and the phone was functional with no issues and I could make and receive calls right away, so far so good. I received the phone which is cosmetically in very good condition and I am quite happy with my purchase with exception of two minor issues which I believe someone could provide me guidance to resolve or trouble shoot. 1) Sometimes the person I am talking on the other side complains not being able to hear me clearly. Likewise, sometimes I cannot hear the other party while receiving calls. This doesn't happen always, may be 50% of the time. Note, that my Bluetooth headset works fine, and even when phone earpiece and microphone are not working, I could use Bluetooth headset to make and receive calls  with no issues. However, I cannot carry my headset with me all the times, especially while I am  working outside... 2) Even though the 'Battery Health' shows 85% but the battery drains very quickly. I am running in low power mode and turn-off all applications that I don't use, also I don't use web-browser or watching videos. I only use my phone to talk and text, why the battery drains so quickly and how I could remedy that.  I've been using phone for just few days; I'll update my review as I do further testing.NOTE :How could I find out which particular MODEL no. of the phone I received?  It shows MN8L2LL/A, whereas I expect to see something like  A1660 or A1778. I am thinking of contacting Apple Support if they could  offer any help.Thanks so much.

",2.0,Katrina K,"Reviewed in the United States September 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  Something is wrong with it. Phone overheats very easily and gets to a really hot temperature despite very minimal usage. The battery also drains out oddly fast despite the fact that I did not even touch it for a day to test it out, but it does charge fairly quickly. I have not kept more than one app on while using it. I use it for precisely 4 minutes and it starts to overheat in my hands. I got a case for it, and I still feel a lot of heat burning it up. I avoid using it while it is charging and I don't leave it in hot environments. It. Just. Overheats like crazy! Also, there was an empty slot in the package, as though an item, that was meant to come with the phone, is missing. I don't know what was supposed to come with it, but I got a charging cord and the phone and that is it. I will research later about the missing item. Anyway, I expected an upgrade from my iphone 6 because of various issues but it seems as though I purchased a ""better"" phone only to run into new and more concerning issues.

  Initially I was happy with the phone. It looked great physically and had no signs of wear and tear. However, the battery health was lower than I wanted; the phone said the battery health was 88%. However, I knew from the ad, that it could ship with as low as 85%, so I can't complain too much about that. The biggest issue with the phone that was an absolute deal breaker was that it frequently crashed and closed apps on me. Other times it would freeze up. Imagine having an emergency and having to make a phone call, only to find out that your phone decided to freeze up?! I have a family, so that's completely unacceptable. The phone also seemed to have connectivity issues and would not connect well with my wifi. It was slower than my other devices on my wifi and would sometimes freeze up. With the problems that I was having, I'm thinking it was a bad main board or ""motherboard"". The seller was MobileSpree. I contacted them and asked for an exchange. They refused to do an exchange and said my only option was to return it. I returned it with the shipping label provided by Amazon. However, even after 5 days of having the phone back, they would not refund my money. I had to get Amazon involved to get a refund. Overall, don't buy. It was a waste of time and money and a hassle to get refunded.

  If you are buying this for Verizon, move along.  I suppose it's possible you'll get an unlocked Verizon phone, but mine arrived as a GSM (AT&T, T-Mobile) only model.  Unlocked or not, without the CDMA radio installed, it'll never work on Verizon.  All iPhones have a GSM radio, so this should work fine for those carriers.  The description is inaccurate, and misleading, however, if they are going to ship out GSM only phones.

  I tried to get a service plan with this phone today and was informed that the phone is not unlocked. It was advertised as unlocked.  It is useless to me. Seller falsely advertised this phone.  At the time of my purchase, there was no indication that it could not be used with any service provided. FALSE, MISLEADING ADVERTISING and REFUSAL TO ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY.  DO WHAT IS RIGHT AND RETURN MY MONEY.
