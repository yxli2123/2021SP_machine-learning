    Nice backpack but not waterproofüôÅ.

  Been out and got caught up in the rain üåß like not heavy rain and when I got home my stuff inside was wet so you can imagine how disappointed I was. And the only reason I kept it is because I like the style and the color but Iike I said before not waterproof. I would prefer if the manufacturer was a little more honest and say that is splash üí¶ proof and not waterproof, big difference.

  I purchased this for my middle school daughter who is now not interested in anything that looks ""too babyish""  This fits the bill according to her.  It looks good and feels sturdy.  I think it is a tad smaller than I would have wanted.  My daughter's school is not using books right now because of virtual learning.  So the backpack has not been tested with anything too heavy. It safely fits her chrome book inside and binder and notebooks. I believe once we add books it will be a tight fit for chrome book and several text books. Price was good.

    Good for professors who want a ""professional"" looking backpack
  
",5.0,Brandon Medley,"Reviewed in the United States February 9, 2021","









  
  
    
  When I first became a professor I insisted on using a whimsical unicorn backpack.  However, as that bag deterioriated over a few years, I thought I might want to replace it with something a bit more *adult.*  I did not want to carry some kind of briefcase or satchel.  This bag holds my papers, laptop, lecture notes, etc.  It seems well made and it looks mature, but not old.  I have not had any major problems with this bag and like it.

",1.0,J,"Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  Giving this a one star for two important reasons.  Misleading and false advertising.  Claims its waterproof and large, its neither.  The pictures intentionally show it to appear almost twice as large as it is.  The waterproof claim is false and reviews back it up, so why after years is the false description still allowed?  Anything for a profit.  How are reviewers overlooking the most important features?  That said, for a small non waterproof backpack, its fine.  Now I have to spend more on larger waterproof backpack and give this to one of the kids.

  I liked the charger port, that came in handy. The backpack is built well and rather substantial but I also was able to cram my laptop, charger, a 2"" binder, four small books and a bunch of miscellaneous supplies with no issues. The straps are comfortable and the backpack stays pretty well balanced when loaded up. Towards the end, the zipper started separating on the main bag but I was also cramming it pretty full and once I fixed it I haven't had any issues.

    THIS BAG IS NOT WATERPROOF AT ALL!! NOT WATERPROOF!!
  
",3.0,Ronald,"Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  I will start off by saying this in an excellent, quality bag. I live in Hawaii and needed a bag to carry my laptop and essentials around and to protect it all from the constant rain. It fits my laptop perfectly, the zippers are quality, and has a good amount of pockets.The cons.....1) THIS BAG IS NOT WATERPROOF AT ALL. At the time of me writing this review, the title of the product says ""SOLDIERKNIFE Durable Waterproof Anti Theft Laptop Backpack Travel Backpacks Bookbag with usb Charging Port for Women & Men School College Students Backpack Fits 15.6 Inch Laptop Black"". Again, THIS BAG IS NOT WATERPROOF. AT ALL. I went to the beach one afternoon and packed my towel and a change of clothes. It had rained a little while I was there and went to the beach showers to change into my dry clothes and leave. My clothes were SOAKED. the zippers were completely zipped and I had my lock on it. Luckily, I did not have my laptop in my bag. I did have my couch drops and breath mints in there and now the inside is sticky and ruined. I came back to this page to make sure I wasn't mistaken of it being waterproof only to find out the fine print says WATER RESISTANT. It is in fact NOT water proof.2) The USB does not provide a good flow of power. I had my phone plugged up and it charged about 5% in 30 minutes. Not a huge bummer, but will not be using it. Better to just get a long cable and charge directly from your power brick with it in your bag.Overall, I like the bag. Great great bag for $20. But, I am upset about it not being waterproof like the title of the product states.

  So, in the description it states that it charges your phone. The charger has to have a port, so what‚Äôs the use of just plugging in another charger in to the other charger, just to use that charger for the port. IIt‚Äôs not water resistant and it‚Äôs not easy to get things in the backpack without getting out of your seat. It is a strong backpack, but if I went back in time, I wouldn‚Äôt do this purchase.

    It‚Äôs really close to awesome.
  
",3.0,Twins1022,"Reviewed in the United States February 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  It‚Äôs close to being really good. Mine arrived with a stitching issue on one of the mesh pockets. The elastic separated from the mesh the first time I tried to use it. It‚Äôs entirely possible this was a fluke.I‚Äôm fussy so this bag might be awesome for you. I travel for work so the details matter. I liked the charging aspect but there‚Äôs no pocket for the charging block to slip into. That‚Äôs an obvious miss. The pocket in the middle compartment needs to be deeper and have a zipper or button so keep it closed. Otherwise it just sort of flops around agape.  A couple more smallish compartments to keep stuff separated would be welcome from my perspective. Professionals that travel need to keep their stuff sorted and easily at hand since you‚Äôre fishing stuff out on airplanes, ubers, conference rooms, etc.I found the carry-on strap a little small. I had a hard time removing the backpack from the handle of my carry on when I was going through the airport. I feel like the handle on my carry-on is pretty typical but your results may vary.I liked the compression straps. Bags like this tend to be floppy and unstructured so the straps help to keep the bag compact and the load closet to your body which is where you want it for comfort. Ten years of Scouts taught me that.It‚Äôs not a bad backpack. I think with a couple of mods by the maker it could be outstanding.  I wound up replacing with a Swiss gear bag I found by accident at target. It looks just about perfect honestly. Time will tell.

",2.0,Mike B.,"Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  The bag looks great! I really like the color and the style, but there are few things about this bag that I do not like.1. The smaller pocket ripped inside at the top. I have had the bag for 2 months-Should last much longer2. The portable charger socket is nice, but the cord on the inside dangles inside of the laptop pouch and there is not specific place to put your portable charger. The ad for the bag said there was a pocket, but I can't seem to find one that leads to the cord.3. Space-There isn't enough divided space to hold all of your cords and gadgets. I feel like they should add one more pocket.Sadly after 2 months, I replaced this bag with a Swiss Bag.

  Waterproof. Comes with a LOCK. Can hold a lot of stuff even though it doesn't look it. If i had to have one complaint about it, it's that sadly they don't come in a smaller laptop version. I have a 12 inch Surface and I wish the strap for laptop pouch was adjustable. But I got it for travel, and it's a really good laptop backpack. Could also use a pouch for the portable charger you can attach. But these are more nitpick things than anything else. I got it in blue and highly recommend it.

",4.0,Carlos Fuentes,"Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  CONCLUSION: This bag is actually great for the price, and quite durable. This bag does what it says, gives you a decent and solid bag for the price. Want a luxury Item? Go spend big bucks on it. This bag is ideal for college students on a budget who travel from classroom to classroom with a couple of notebooks and a laptop/Ipad.The Dark Horse feature:The front pocket is very spatious and convenient. It can fit all my basic cleaning supplies for when I need to brush my teeth and or shower on the go (again, I work at a hospital as an intern and part time at a call center). It fits: Brush, paste, a thermometer cuz u never know, my deodorant and there is still room for a small mouthwash bottle and some mini soap or shampooo tubes/ cream tubes you may use. My fave feature.The good:1. Nice sleek design, and nice color. Very slim and portable, it ain't too flashy either.2. The charging port is very convenient if you're into that.3. The lock is a very nice feature.4. Its quite roomy on the main central pocket, quite deep.The good-ish:1. The material is durable enough. It's not a Victorinox bag, usually thicc, but this one is sturdy enough.2. I would have liked it to be a little bigger but for daily light travel (to work and the hospital in my case), it does the trick. It will resist heavier packages from time to time, but I wouldn't push my luck too far.3. Its not exactly comfortable on the back, it has a rough feel to it. Again, for the price, is not like you could ask for a top tier ergonomic design.

  I bought this backpack for my daughter. She is a homeschooler (2020, Covid) and I still work part-time. So she gets hauled around to our family sitters and has to bring all her school books, a laptop, headphones, chargers, and sometimes overnight gear too. It all fits. Beautifully. And even though it's heavy, she feels that it's not nearly as heavy as in the bags we were using before - and the backpack distributes the weight better/more comfortably. We went from 3 bags (school books/supplies, laptop tote, and overnight bag) to 1. It looks just like the picture. And she loves it.

  We bought this backpack for my daughter who will be a sophomore this year. The students at her school carry everything with them from class to class, so it was essential for us to choose something sturdy that would fit several books and school supplies and be as comfortable as it could be to carry around. We were happy to see the bag is pretty well padded throughout and has extra points of comfort for her back. The handle and straps seem nice and hefty, as well. While she hasn't gone back to school yet, she did use this bag as a carry-on for a recent trip and stuffed it full of books, games, snacks & things of that nature. She appreciated the lock and charging capability as she had a portable battery with her and it enabled her to keep that inside and have easy access to her phone. She said it was comfortable to carry around and overall, she seems quite pleased with it.

  I needed a new backpack for an upcoming trip since my other one was falling apart. I had seen one similar to this as far as the style goes, but it was 3x the price. I liked the style and it was on sale at the time so for under $20 so why not. It kept my laptop secure with it's own pocket in the main compartment with a wide Velcro fastened strap and my mouse, power supply as well as a change of cloths, a book, light jacket & a couple magazines.  there was still more room. I got caught in a north Texas downpour and everything stayed dry. I also liked the strap for holding it on my suitcase, it was very easy to wheel around without it falling off. It has a second compartment for items that are flatter and pockets for pens, notepad etc. The front has a zipper I put some cables in, but it should hold a small note book. It seems sturdy so far. I didn't try the included USB cable since I didn't bring a battery, I would have liked to have it go to the center middle compartment with the pockets. The back was padded and comfortable, but the shoulder straps could have a little more padding.

  Very sturdy, really attractive, good storage organization, and great price. The charging port works like this - you need to attach your own portable battery to the USB cable built into the inside of the bag. Then you attach your own charging cable to the USB port on the outside of the bag. It may be my perception that charging was slower than normal with this setup, BUT it's a trim, neat way to manage it. (I got a silver charging cable so it's even tidier looking).My favorite thing? A lot of these brands-you-don't-find-in-Target-or-Macy's bags on Amazon have names and logos that look very odd to typical Target-or-Macy's shoppers. This one looks classy, is spelled right, and has a mildly threatening militant feel like I really enjoy!

  Because the instructions for how to set the lock are terrible, I'll put better ones here:1. Set dials to 000, the defualt unlock code (make sure that unlocks it, just to be safe)2. Push in and hold the button on the bottom, where the diagram is pointing to with (1)3. (While still holding the button) turn the dials to desired lock combination4. Release the button5. Turn the dials to some random combination, and then turn them to your set lock combination. It should only unlock when turned to the lock combination you set.I still have to test the bag itself, but I figured people would like to know how to set the lock if they couldn't figure it out for themselves.

  My daughter started college in the fall and has been using this for 2 and 1/2 months. The strap broke this week and she has been carrying her backpack instead of having it strapped on her back. I wouldn't have even minded honestly if it had lasted one year that would have been fair for 25 bucks or whatever but to only last two and a half months is ridiculous.

    NOT WATERPROOF!!!!! NOT EVEN WATER RESISTANT!!!

  The whole point of this back pack was to be waterproof. I ride a motorcycle and got caught by rain and my laptop in my saddlebags..my laptop for school did not get damaged but I wasn‚Äôt going to make the same mistake again..so I decided to buy a waterproof bag. Well I got my bad a little dirty and decided to hose it off with a mist (just like rain) and my clothes in it got completely soaked. Laptop was thankfully out of the bag at the time. Description is wrong!! Not even misleading, just wrong. Deserves 1 star.

    Total steal for this awesome backpack

  $20 for a really comfy a backpack? I use this to schlep around my Microsoft Surface tablet along with other stuff for work + toddler stuff like baby wipes, snacks, extra clothes, hand wipes... you get the idea. It holds everything with room to spare. The padded area for tablet is nice and has a Velcro band to make sure everything stays put. Deep pocket holds everything you need. Charging cord comes in really handy! Option to lock it if you‚Äôd like. This is definitely a steal for how nice this is.

    Great backpack; terrible charging cable
  
",4.0,BusterBeachside,"Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2021","









  
  
    
  It's a bog standard backpack. It has all the space you should need for all your everyday things. I had to take off a star because the internal USB cable that you're meant to use for charging your phone is VERY low quality. No matter what configuration I tried, my phone would only slow charge when using it. It does a proper fast charge when connected directly to my power bank. So if you're looking for a backpack with a proper charging cable, definitely look elsewhere. It's hardly even an added bonus because of how slow it is, lol.

  I wanted a backpack to travel with so I could stuff everything into one place.  This backpack exceeds my every expectation and I have VERY high expectations for stuff I pay good money for.  The pack is VERY comfortable.  Holds everything I could possible want to smoosh into a pack.  I even tried putting my dog inside to go for a hike and she even likes it!  (She doesn't like anything but her food and naps.)  It's a great grey color and I look forward to using it each time I bring it out.  Thank you for a great product and exceeding my expectations!

  I love this bag. I bought it to replace a backpack of mine that the zippers were no longer working correctly. I had purchased another bag and had to return it because it was too small.I purchased the small bag in this backpack and it is bigger than my original backpack. Lots of room to store items and is well made and very very sturdy.

  Nice little backpack it was between either this or a JanSport over at Office Max and I decided to get this I like it because of the charging port that makes it convenient to charge your phone and now I can plug in my battery pack that I got from Amazon as well I probably buy this bag again I like the combination lock that keeps people out although I wish it had more than one combo lock it's still a good bag for traveling and I will definitely get much use out of this for my electronics and everything else as an on-the-go storage bag to keep my stuff safe and a little bit of shopping on the side I even like the holsters in the side for mugs will work great when I get my coffee travel mugs a great travel bag for a man on the go

  I'm going on a business trip next week and I purchased this backpack so that I could carry everything I need as I go from office to office. I wanted something that was functional and looked professional. The backpack has a sleek look. It is definitely not a kid's backpack. The laptop pocket is deep enough for my laptop and my iPad Pro. It has lots of room for other items and depending on what I put in the backpack, a sweater may fit as well. The two side pockets are big enough and high enough to securely hold my water bottle or travel mug. The usb cord may be helpful, but there is no dedicated pocket for the charger. I would have expected one to secure the charger. As it looks, the charger either needs to sit in the pocket for the laptop or in the larger area in front of it. I'm unsure if the cord will stay attached if the charger is allowed to move around in the backpack.So here is the frustrating part. The ""small anti-theft pocket in the lower back?"" It is not in the lower back, it is on the front of the backpack and faces away from the wearer. The description makes it sound like it is on the part of the backpack against the wearer's back and, therefore, unreachable by others. It is not. Also, I don't know how it is anti-theft. It doesn't lock and unless you squish tabs together, you can't use the lock to secure it.I'm going to pack it up today and use it this week to see if I can find some solutions here.  The price is low enough that I may be able to overlook the issues.

    Best backpack for students
  
",5.0,Jonna,"Reviewed in the United States December 19, 2019","









  
  
    
  Great pack for students! Our family has been Jansport customers for 10 years, they were the only backpacks that made it through an entire school year with our boys, until now. Got one for $17 on a flash sale and am now going back to buy 2 more at regular price. The material really holds up to abuse after 2 months it still looks brand new and has been tossed on the floor at least once daily. Best part is I'm no longer having to waterproof their packs. Charging from the backpack is convenient and comes in handy when they can't be by a charging outlet at school. The padded compartment is perfect for keeping their school laptops safe.

    Was perfect to keep my ice skates and then boots in for skating on a canal
  
",5.0,sky,"Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  Bought this for an outdoor ice skating trip. Did the job well as a perfect daypack to just fit all my supplies in for the day of skating. The water bottle holders on the side are very sturdy! You can fall, drop the bag, toss it around a bit and your water bottle does not fall out!! The charger on the side came in handy too! I just plugged my battery pack in on the inside for the day and connected my cord on the outside. When I was not suing it, I just stuffed it into the bottle holder and it stayed! It's also a nice place to put your phone while it's charging. However, I will say those bottle holders are hard to reach while the pack is on your back.Backpack is also very comfy!My only gripe is right after I took it out of packaging, it got a stain out of nowhere! (I have no idea what caused the stain!) It's just this dark spot sitting there and kind of embarrassing since I just bought the bag new and can't wash it due to the USB plug. I later got some lotion on it in another place and think the original stain was caused by lotion as well. Also, like others mentioned, it does kind of stink and if you put any clothes in there the smell does linger on them.

  It is definitely not as big as I thought it was going to be. It kind of is a decent size but I expected something bigger and something that would be able to hold more but overall the design itself is very well made but we'll see in the next few months how long it lasts. The size of the backpack is the only reason why it didn't get a five stars for me.

",4.0,SoCal Man,"Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2019","









  
  
    
  Bought this because it was relatively cheap. Its main compartment can hold 2-3 books tightly , as it isn‚Äôt that wide. The case for laptops is padded and elevated off the bottom so no smacking the bottom of the laptop. It does have a USB inside/outside connection, but its high in the bag so any item you connect will be hanging or resting on books, so its hard to see a use for it. It comes with a cheapy lock and a key holder that snaps in the smaller compartment that looks stronge enough  to hold 2-3 keys tops . All in all its a functional backpack that protects my laptop well, which is teally all i wanted

  I bought this for my middle schooler who is now bike riding to school. It is soooo worth the money. I was worried it would be cheap and fall apart (he's REALLY rough on bookbags), but this thing is indestructible! It fits ALL his books, binder, lunch AND a ukulele to take every day to school. The kid even fell off his bike (waving to another kid??) and the bag had no rips, tears, scuffs, nothing! I wish everything was this durable!

  I bought this backpack specifically for travel.  The size is perfect for use as a personal item when flying and fits fine under the seat. For a bag at this price point, I was extremely happy with the build quality. The zippers seem to be decent quality and the interior pockets are well designed for my travel needs. I do travel with a laptop and like the dedicated pocket for it. The USB port is a great add on. I have a battery backup that I plugged into the port with the included cord and now I have no more need to find an outlet at the airport to give my phone a charge. For under $20 this is really a good buy.

  I have been searching for a smaller backpack for travel that had a laptop slot. I am a 5ft 1in female & I have had some back injuries in the past so most of the travel backpacks are way too big &/or uncomfortable for me.This one is a great size and has many great features and will hold a lot of items! I was able to get my laptop, device chargers, 2 slim packing cubes & 1 XS packing cube in the main compartment. The front zipper has my planner, a notebook, pens & other misc items & a small zipper pouch with cosmetic items.It also comes with a lock for the zippers - nice extra bonus!The straps are very comfortable and it feels great on my back when walking.  I ordered the grey for $19.98 and it's a bargain for sure as this definitely looks and feels like a much more expensive backpack. I'm so glad I got this one!
