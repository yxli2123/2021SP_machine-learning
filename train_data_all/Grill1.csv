    Great product with some production flaws, Terrible Warranty Service
  
",3.0,Steph S,"Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2017","I am sad that I cannot give this a full 5 stars, but since Cuisinart refuses to answer my concerns about this product, I must make sure the people are aware of the issues.

I have bought two of these in less than 6 years. I take really good care of my items; I still have the original box and foam inserts just in case I needed to move it or ship it back for warranty purposes (explanation in a minute).

The side buttons that you push to pop out the grill plates are plastic and one will break after a couple years of frequent use. That means, you have no button to push and the metal underneath is inside the machine-not easy to access. I bought the second panini grill for the same issues as the first one in March 2015, not having kept original receipt to know if it was under warranty, so I was thrilled to see that this one was still within the three year warranty.

I called the Warranty number and was told that I'd have to ship it back and the cost was on me. You're also expected per their warranty paperwork to pay an additional $10 to get a repaired/refurbished/potentially new one back. I did ask to have that second fee waived, as it seemed unfair. So, I go to the U.S. Post Office with the machine in its original pristine box.

It was $38.12 to ship via ground and $42 for priority. I was shocked. The box looks so brand new that the agent assumed it was and she joked to the other postal worker did she want to buy it from me? I explained that it needed repair and her jaw dropped. She too thought it was absurd that they would not send me a postal order as the weight and the fact it has to go cross-country is what makes the shipping so much. I decided that for more than half the price of the item, it didn't make sense to ship. I checked with UPS and they too were over $24. I mean, I can see paying $15, but this is too much money for a $59.99 item (that I paid $91 with tax in 2015 when it was still a higher price as their newer model).

So I called Cuisinart back and explained my case. I was told that if I wanted to use the Warranty, I had to ship it because that is what I agreed to-did I have a choice? They wouldn't even offer me $34 towards a brand new one.

I really loved this product and am disappointed that Cuisinart makes their warranty policy difficult to honor. I even contacted them on Facebook privately to see if they'd look into my case and work with me, but they didn't even bother to respond.

I wonder if the extended warranty offered here on Amazon by the third party would not make me jump through hoops if I wanted to buy another one. Just not sure I am wasting my money or not. I don't like the ethics of a warranty that costs you a fortune in order of fit to be honored.

As for the machine itself:

The pros:
-makes a great panini;
-great for indoor grilling meat/fish/vegetables ;
-awesome griddle (makes best hash browns);
-nonstick plates;
-can buy waffle plates to make waffles;
-can make eggs, bacon, hash browns at the same time when it's flat

Cons:

-Buttons that hold the grill plates are plastic and don't last long
-Warranty is three years, but if you contact them, they require you to ship the entire product back and shipping is over $34 through the U.S. Postal Service on ground shipping (not priority). You're expected to pay $10 in addition to get a repaired/refurbished/potentially new one back.",

    DON'T DO IT
  
",1.0,joe b.,"Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2018","









  
  
    
  I'm a chef, so perhaps my expectations are too high, but I was entirely disappointed in this product.  It has so much promise, but it looks and feels cheaply made.  It is very light, and it rattles when you move it because none of the parts fit snugly.  I can't imagine it has the durability to last long especially if is used a lot.  The grease trap is awkward and a bit of a challenge to remove.It does not cook well.  The handbook says it takes 10 minutes to heat up - try more like 20 minutes.  The minute you put food on it, the temperature drops precipitously, so for most of the cooking time, the grill is struggling to get up to temp.  The pannini function is sketchy at best because the top griddle is not heavy enough to heat product effectively or to get good grill marks.As a professional cook, I would not purchase or recommend this product.  A good cast iron skillet does a better job and lasts forever.  As it is, the griddle does not live up to the Cusinart name, which until I ordered this, has always meant good quality products that cook well and last a long time - not this one.

  I purchased this Cuisinart Griddler because my husband and I just weren’t happy with our George Foreman Grill 

  
George Foreman GRP1060B 4 Serving Removable Plate Grill, Black









  
  
    
  .  It didn't have temperature adjustment, the drip tray would melt every time hot grease would drip in it (or after being put in the top rack of dishwasher), and it just wasn't big enough really.  When I came across this one on Amazon with such stellar reviews, I thought this would be the one for us.  So I ordered it along with the waffle attachment 

  
Cuisinart GR-WAFP Griddler Waffle Plates









  
  
    
  .I have used it at least ten times since I received it.  So far I have cooked eggs, bacon, pork chops, toast, a Philly steak sandwich, and waffles (with the waffle plates I purchased separately).  Everything has turned out great except the first time I cooked eggs on it because I didn't use cooking spray on it beforehand.  So keep in mind that you will need to lightly spray the plates with cooking spray or use butter before placing your items on it that may stick.I love that I have the option of using either the griddle or the grill plates.  When you use the Griddle setting you get to select a temperature between 200 up to 425 degrees.  If you use the Grill/Panini setting you select your temperature as either warm, low, medium, high, and sear.  There are also marks in between those settings so you are able to get a setting of medium-high for example.The plates (including the waffle plates) are dishwasher safe but after owning the George Foreman for years I am choosing to hand wash my plates on this Cuisinart.  When I would put the George Foreman plates in the dishwasher it would never seem to get them very clean.  I guess it is just too difficult to cut through all that grease and stuck on food that was burned on.  It is super easy to clean the plates on this Cuisinart though.  The non-stick plates make it where I can just wipe the mess right up with little to no effort.  Very nice.I like that the drip tray on this grill is attached underneath the unit.  That was a big frustration for me with the other grill.  To constantly have to place it under the grill in just the right spot, then find something to do with it until it cooled down.  I have furbabies so I didn't want to leave it out because they look at it as ""oh look, a meal!""  Since this drip tray is attached I can pull it out and clean it when I please and then place it right back into the slot.  Easy peasy.I love that I can fold this unit flat and make bacon, eggs, and toast all at the same time.  It is wonderful.  It is so nice not to have to dirty up a bunch of pots and pans and tun on my range all the time.Overall I really am proud of this Griddler.  It has been a welcome replacement to our old grill and is definitely one of my best Amazon purchases.If you find my review useful please let me know and if you have any questions or comments, feel free to post them below and I will answer them as quickly as possible. Thank you for checking out my review. :)

  I bought this two years ago.  I really liked it at first, sans the dripping fat down the back, and I even purchased one for my daughter in college.  After about a year, I found it didn't sear near as well as it did when new.  The last time I used it, I made two 1/2-in burgers. I pre-heated it on high for 15 minutes - it ended up with a semi brown mess.  I have since thrown it away.  I never said anything to my daughter about it - she called last week and said, ""Mom, I hate to tell you this, but I don't much like this unit.""  She had the exact same problems.  Shheeez - $200 down the drain.  Now I'm searching for a replacement.

  4 stars for material quality,1 star for durability because my particular unit would not heat up the cooking surfaces and4 stars because it seems like a versatile product.First use out of the box, had the unit plugged in with green lights blinking and a bowl of pancake batter waiting for a pre-Christmas Sunday morning breakfast.15 minutes later, the unit is still ice cold with green lights blinking. Oh, it's supposed to be closed to heat up? My mistake.I close the unit, green lights blinking.My husband comes over to see if he can help and presses down on the handle. Now the lights are all out. I press down on the handle and the lights come back on. The stainless steel top of the unit is scorching hot so I figure the plates are hot.I open the unit and lay it flat, drip a bit of water droplets onto the plates and they sizzle. Perfect temperature, right?I ladle out my batter, excited to make enough pancakes at once for my family. I watch my batter - no bubbles.What the he11? The heat is off (again?) So now I have this thing laid flat with pancake batter on both sides and no heat.I scraped the batter off and back into the bowl. Got out a frying pan and made breakfast on the stovetop, cursing the Griddler the entire time.I was so excited to get this, so excited to use it but the design and execution is poor. Maybe it's my unit, maybe I am not patient enough but the bottom line is that my unit did not heat properly, if at all and the thing is going back for a full refund.

  I bought this to replace a George Foreman Grill with removable plates (which I DEARLY loved but the plates were completely worn).  I selected this model because it looks good and more versatile than my old grill for about the same price.  It was carefully packaged and received on time.  My first impression was that it must be flimsy since it was so much lighter than my old one.  But after inspecting it and washing the plates, I realized that the main difference in weight was the plates.  Not only are they considerably lighter in weight, they are much easier to remove and clean.  The main reason the plates in my old one failed is because they were very clumsy to remove and clean after every use, so I neglected cleaning it way more than I should have.  After grilling my first hamburger, I fell in love with this grill.  Not only was cleaning a breeze, but it seemed like the burger tasted much better.  So I decided to try a panini (which was completely new to me).  I sliced a hunk of kielbasi in half lengthwise and grilled it, then put it between 2 slices of bread and made my first ever panini.  Now I'm hooked and looking forward to new cooking adventures to broaden my cooking horizons.  Only time will tell how long this thing will last, but for now I'm enjoying it and it looks good sitting on my counter.After using it for a month, I still love it, but I'm glad I bought the brush.  It really makes cleanup a breeze!

    Not enough heat. Defective unit.
  
",1.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States November 19, 2019","









  
  
    
  Cooked pancakes and the Griddler does not get up to correct Temps. Lower plate peaked at 313F, upper plate at 253F. Not hot enough to brown pancakes. Have had difficulty getting a replacement, being directed to the wrong people, needing info on the unit while I was at work etc. I love the design and if we get a unit that works as advertised I would be delighted to keep and recommend it.Photo detail: green preheat light on when set to 425. Instant read thermometer may not be perfectly accurate, but when pancakes are completely dried on top and won't brown the heat is obviously too low.

  I can't say enough great compliments about this griddle.  We had a Hamilton Beach griddle with two plates (one ribbed and the other flat) which we used consistently two or three times a week for many, many years and were slow to replace because we loved cooking with it so much.  My husband and I have decided that this one is better.  There is no timer (which the Hamilton Beach had) so that I didn't have to keep resetting it.  It also has controls of the heat which is very useful as well as the two plate construction that we liked in the former griddle, but it's now just one reversible plate with the Cuisinart.  We've made our usuals on it such as hamburgers, steaks, chicken, Italian sausage and peppers as well as pressed sandwiches like Cubans.  All came out perfect!  Also, one of the features that we liked about our former griddle was that we could cook meat right from the freezer to the griddle.  The Cuisinart griddle is no exception.  It's very convenient to be able to grab something out of the freezer and just place it on the griddle.  I don't know what the other reviewers were complaining about, but hooray for the Cuisinart griddle!!!

    Awesome Cuisinart Grill
  
",5.0,JW,"Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2018","









  
  
    
  I really like the Cuisinart Grill. It is just the right size and cooks both sides of the food item evenly and at the same time. The grill plates have 2 sides, one for grilling stakes or panini sandwiches, and the other side for grilling pancakes, eggs, bacon, etc.. It is easy to set the the temperature to handle different items. The grill plates are non-stick and are easily removed for easy cleaning. The grill has a removable try that collects grease and runoff from whatever you are grilling. Very easy to remove and clean. Also, the grill has a floating top grill that automatically adjusts for the thickness of your food item. I am very happy with my purchase, I use this grill several times  week.

    Performance & Warranty
  
",4.0,Keren4L,"Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought the Cuisinart Griddler in December, purchasing the 3-yr warranty as well. I loved it!!! It was teriffic for steaks, burgers, pannini, waffles, etc. Two weeks ago, in the middle of cooking dinner, open-face position, it just stopped heating (dinner ruined). I unplugged it, cleaned it, and tried again a couple nights later - no go, wouldn't heat at all. I logged into Amazon to see if there were any reviews that might be helpful - there were quite a number of negative reviews around the warranty (which I don't recall being there when I ordered the griddler) and I feared that I would be in for the same outcome. I'm happy to report that the customer service representative with whom I spoke was extremely accommodating & helpful; she made the process so very easy: Cuisinart is sending me a new replacement for which I paid $10 for shipping (an amount I consider reasonable) & I am responsible only for cutting off the power cord of the no-longer-working Cuisinart, along with my contact info and the make and model number of the item. I thanked the rep for being so helpful and told her about all the negative customer reviews on Amazon around the warranty & assured her that I would post a very positive review. It's quite possible that all the negative reviews put pressure on Cuisinart to amend their warranty response. If so, I'm so very thankful to all those who posted the negative reviews. I am, however, so looking forward to receiving the replacement and putting it to good use.

    The most handy appliance for quick cooking and grilling
  
",5.0,Hanon Ondricek,"Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2017","









  
  
    
  This is the best appliance I have purchased and it has a permanent spot on my counter. I use it 4-5 times a week, and it's simplified cooking and cleanup of quick snacks and larger meals. I had a cheaper grill that was smaller and really hard to clean, and the functionality of this blows it out of the water.Pros:-Plates are removable for easy nonstick cleanup in the sink or the dishwasher.-Plates are reversible for grill-marks or flat panini sandwiches and other non-grill items.-Fast heat-up and cooking - a chicken breast filet is done in 4-5 minutes with no flip.-This cooks bacon crispy in 5-7 minutes on both sides with no flip, no splatter when closed, and channels grease into the...-Handy no-mess concealed grease tray. Dump in the trash and rinse with hot water, it's ready to go again.-Great for indoor grilling, does not heat up the kitchen measurably like the oven.-Toasts and compresses any sandwich for a hot, crispy treat; better and healthier than frozen pocket snacks. Makes great grilled wraps and folded quesadillas.-Does not require oil or butter for cooking if you prefer grilling for healthiness, gives veggies a tasty char.Minor Cons:-Only feature it's missing is a way to hold the top plate to ""hover"" above so it doesn't touch the top of the food for open face cheese melting or reheating pizza.-Not ideal for meats still on the bone - purchase boneless meat, or trim any bones before cooking-Ground meat patties can get a bit dry (similar to a Foreman Grill) due to pressure from the top plate; baste them with some olive oil, butter, or other liquid near the end or after cooking. Or unhinge the thing and use it like a one-sided flat grill.-I accidentally put two large steaks on that covered the entire surface of the grill and were still cool from the fridge which killed all the built-up heat so the meat sort of ""stewed"" in its own juice. They were still good, but for the char you want, cut steaks smaller so they won't overwhelm the unit's heating ability, and start them at room temperature. If you need a lot of steak, cook them in batches and give the unit a chance to keep the heat up; they don't take long.

    IMPOSSIBLE TO KEEP CLEAN...
  
",1.0,Dreamsupply,"Reviewed in the United States March 12, 2020","









  
  
    
  I know I know... 15,000 reviews can't be wrong right?Wrong.I tried sooooo hard to like this Griddler.... but I had to throw it away... and when I did, I felt so relieved!Here's why:The TINY opening on the griddle surface that drains the grease into the drip tray... as well as the drip tray shape and placement... are not fully effective.... to the point where the entire unit collects grease basically EVERYWHERE.... on the sides, underneath, on the back, on the feet... and constantly needs to be cleaned on every single surface.It shouldn't require that much attention every time you use it.The grease drip opening is roughly 1/4""... so if you're cooking anything that generates a lot of grease... burgers, bacon, you name it... that opening can get clogged really fast unless you are vigilant and watching it every second.In addition, the little strip on the edges of the griddle surface.... that's meant to prevent grease from spilling off the side IS VERY SHALLOW.... so again, if you're cooking up bacon or burgers, it barely can keep the grease in, and often not... so if there's a backup of grease in the drip drain opening, it will overrun the sides.... as it did for us almost every time we used it.Also... the little receptacle that collects the drained grease at the bottom... is like a mini-funnel that feeds into the tray... which also gets clogged easily... creating a backsplash that starts to splash grease all over the back of the unit... and on the counter you have it resting on... so you're constantly cleaning up grease. The drip pan is also VERY clunky to remove, you really have to yank it to get it out, which can cause additional spills.So we finally gave up and got something else.... which is wayyyyy easier to use... we use it with joy and smile at breakfast... and that one is called the Presto 07062 Ceramic 22-inch Electric Griddle... also available here on Amazon.After only a single use I knew the Presto was for us... a huge 22"" surface cooking area for cooking everything you could possibly want for one person or a while family... a HUGE grease drip drain... probably 5-6"" wide... so grease easily drains out without even a second thought... and an amazing drip pan that's easily accessible, easy to remove, with no spills and no fuss... not a drop of grease goes anywhere other than in the drip pan.... even when cooking 12 slices of bacon! And clean up like a dream too... if you have the counter space you won't be disappointed with the Presto.

    Poor Drip Design
  
",3.0,i7Rage,"Reviewed in the United States September 12, 2018","









  
  
    
  This thing makes a mean panini. I also ordered the waffle plates you can substitute in and I had great success with them. The adjustable temperature control is a boon for both endeavors.Unfortunately, the drip design is just terrible. So much so that I ordered a George Forman grill for cooking meats specifically. There's not enough of an angle on the bottom plate to funnel the grease out, so often it just pools or spills out the back and all over the counter. The top unit and plate can disconnect and become free moving with thicker foods. This is nice to make sure you have contact all across a thick steak for example, but again it creates problems with grease dripping on the counter when you lift the upper unit and it can continue to face down while hovering over your counter. And the upper unit gets extremely hot! Hot enough to burn your hand. I'm talking about the OUTSIDE casing, not the plate.If you're mostly interested in grilling burgers, brats, etc. get the Foreman. With nice sloped design you can put your meat in a folded piece of foil, the grease will all drip out, you then throw away the foil, wipe down the Foreman with a wet paper towel and you're done. I think for that specific purpose the Foreman grill is the better product.

    Great replacement to my old Faberware
  
",5.0,Leo K,"Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2019","









  
  
    
  Bought to this Cuisinart 5-in-1 Griddler to replace a similar Faberware one that didn’t make pass a year and a half, and that last half year, the Faberware was barely a useful hot plate. Worked ok in griddle more, but when converted to flat griddle, it barely got warm. I was able to place my whole hand on it without getting burnt.That being said, I wouldn’t dare do that with this Cuisiart Griddler, when it gets hot, it gets scorching. I find myself having to dial down the temperature a but compare to my old griddle. Get panini nice and toasted in no time, but I use the griddle more often on this device, making pancakes during the weekends. The pancakes come off the griddle with a uniform tan color, not too raw, and not too over cooked. Griddle is large enough that I can get a good dozen silver dollar size pancakes going all at once.Outside of the hot plate, I like the mechanical switch between griddle and press mode, something the Faberware one lacked. The Faberware was more like a turning volume style knob, versus an actual toggle switch. It’s either set to press/griddle or its not, none of this continuously twisting the knob until it figures out what you want it to do.Only real test left is to see how long it will last. I got just over a year with the other brand, hoping Cuisinart will not disappoint with this griddle.I have no issue currently recommending this product to anyone looking for something similar.

",2.0,HappyChef,"Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2018","









  
  
    
  I was really excited about buying this because of the stellar reviews and the removable plates (""OMG so easy to clean!!!""). A couple months' later, however, I'm less enthused.When I used both plates, I suspect that they were different temperatures. When I checked on my grilled cheese after a few minutes, the top was always much lighter than the bottom. After putting on the bottom slice of bread, it took me 5 seconds to add the cheese and top slice of bread, then close the lid. That doesn't even begin to account for the disparity in browning.Also, the ""floating"" lid only works if the food is a certain thickness. My 1/4 lb burgers were too thin, so the top plate would either rest on the back of the patty or the front, and I had to grill one side at a time.I can't return it since I missed my window, so I'm just going to be glad that I didn't flush even more money away on the Deluxe model.

    Really good for grilling, but caveats when using as a griddle
  
",4.0,Kimberly Lazarski,"Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2017","









  
  
    
  I have been using this for months now and am pleased with it.  I've grilled chicken, paninis, and steaks (searing only to rare; no sane person intentionally takes a steak to well done! ;) ) on it many times now.I've also done pancakes and eggs, but those are a bit tricky as when unfolded this grill does NOT sit even; you need to be creative and prop up the legs to level the unit before using it as a griddle with eggs or pancakes.Also, draining could be improved by a lot; I find when I grill chicken if there are lots of drippings, I'll need to use a rubber scraper or basting brush to nudge the drippings toward the drain notch.The heating elements are varying widely at first (as other reviews indicate) but if I am patient and wait for the griddle plates to get ""heat soaked"" then both plates are very nearly the same temperature. It does not reach this point until the unit has been on for ~10 minutes or so. So, if doing anything somewhat temp-sensitive (i.e., pancakes, waffles) be patient and wait for the plates to fully pre-heat, as the ""ready"" light comes on before that point is reached. Wait for the light to go out, and then come back on a second time then you're good to go.If it weren't for having to creatively level the griddle, and manually push drippings toward the drain, I would happily rate this five stars.

    the floating top design pivoted open causing a lot of grease from the top grill plate to drip all over my counters
  
",3.0,Jake Hoey,"Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2018","









  
  
    
  I'm honestly not a fan of this grill. I live in an apartment that doesn't allow grills, so I figured I would try this one out. First of all, the reason I love grilling so much is because of the lack of mess it creates. Obviously that's more of a feature with outdoor grills, but this thing is the messiest kitchen appliance I have ever used. The first time I used it I cooked frozen burgers on it. It cooked the food pretty well but when I opened it to take off the burgers, the floating top design pivoted open causing a lot of grease from the top grill plate to drip all over my counters. Not a very good first impression. Secondly, since there isn't an angle to the plates, the grease just kind of pools around the food you're cooking. If you want to try to get some the grease off the plates, you'll either need to blot it off with paper towels (which can become a major waste of paper towels) or you need to get it into the drip tray. Good luck getting all of the grease into that little 3/4 inch slit in the back of the plate. Major PIA. Also, I haven't checked yet but I think grease was somehow getting onto the heat coils when I was pressing the excess grease to the back slit. I'm going to try some other stuff on this that isn't so greasy. Maybe some chicken, and I'll definitely use it for toasting quesadilla tortillas, and maybe for larger breakfast meals, but it's not nearly as versatile as I originally hoped. One nice thing is the removable plates and that all parts that will be in contact with food/grease are dishwasher safe.

  Man I want to love this thing, it has cooked amazing the last 7 months but sadly now the top half which can lock in place doesn't. So it just dangles there and since it also gets hot you have to be careful cause it stick out more since it doesn't lock. Shame cause it really does a good job. I was using it twice a week for reference and almost never used it to press but just liked grilling on the bottom half so I don't squeeze the juices out.

  Finally wore out the grill plates (just the grill side, the griddle side is still good and the waffle plates still look new) and decided we'd just buy a new unit.Honestly, i'd have just bought new grill plates for the old one if I'd used the right search terms and seen the third party replacement plate set before I ordered a new griddler. The old one still heats fine but its gotten banged about in moves and the release button on the top part is broken (you poke your finger in to trip the release) and there's grease worked deep inside the body we can't get out without a teardown that would void the warranty.We love this griddler, its got plenty of real estate, sufficient heat and control of heat, presses sandwiches nicely, the plates last a long time (and we bought the OXO brush this time, to keep from using the scrubbing pad on them). It's bigger than the Foreman grills we had before Griddler number 1. We're going to do a better job getting grease spatter off the body to keep it clean.TL;DR - highly recommend this machine, we use ours a LOT. Tough, long-lasting, capacious, good heating and easy to clean.

    Underpowered and Uneven Heating
  
",2.0,Marianne Shore,"Reviewed in the United States October 6, 2018","









  
  
    
  I really wanted to like this item.  I loved the idea of being able to cook my eggs or pancakes on one side and grill my bacon on the other. When the first one I bought didn't work properly, Amazon was great about sending me a replacement.  I am now getting ready to send that one back.  The first problem is that the whole unit is underpowered. Even if you preheat it and put it on the highest temperature setting,  a few slices of bacon take over 20 minutes to cook.You just can't get the darn thing hot enough to cook things properly.  The second problem is that the top doesn't get as hot as the bottom no matter what temperature setting you use.  So if you're grilling anything with the top down, the bottom will get overdone while you're trying to get the top cooked.  I bought the extra waffle plates and encountered the same problem--the bottom of every waffle was nearly burned by the time the top was cooked.  I like how easily the plates slide in and out, and the fact they can go in the dishwasher.  I also think the grease collection system works well.  That's why I gave it the two stars, just to be fair.  But until they fix the problem with not having enough power and the uneven heating, I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone.

  I would give the product 0 star if amazon allows that option. broke in under 7 month in spite of handling with so much love and care.I would give this product 5 star for its design but am having to give it 1 star due to poor build quality. We used it with utmost care possible and only used it 3 to 4 times a week. It is broken now. The waffle mode does not work. One of the two surface can be heated, top or bottom.Disappointed. I wish I had purchased insurance plan while buying this product.While it lasted we enjoyed the waffles. But 7 most is too soon for this to end up in a grave.

    Absolutely delicious Panini's & Waffles!  We're very happy with it!
  
",5.0,Ima Consumer,"Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2016","









  
  
    
  We've only had this product a little less than two weeks, but our appreciation of it is much better than we could have imagined. We cooked on it about ten times, so far. Initially, when reading the reviews, We were a little concerned about the right temperature setting to be used for Panini's and for waffles (which is the only thing we have cooked, so far), but it could not have been easier, much to our amazement.  Even the first use produced delicious results, and it has only gotten better since.The Panini's are incredibly delicious.  Prior to this purchase, we used to occasionally eat Panini's at our local Corner Bakery Café (a chain restaurant in So.Cal.), but ours taste just as good as theirs (if not better), and ours are much cheaper, too!  We cook the Panini's on high for four minutes.The waffles are also delicious; the best we've had in years, and we don't notice any difference in the color between the top and the bottom.  They are cooked at 400 degrees for four minutes, just like the Panini's.Caution: even though the instructions warn about this, just make sure you DO NOT touch ANYTHING but the handle when the Griddler is in operation. Even the lid is very hot and you will easily get burned!Our only area of concern about this machine is when we read some of the reviews about the gradual deterioration of the non-stick surface.  Obviously, we can't comment on that, since our machine is so new, but you can be sure our review will be updated if we notice that later.  One good thing, however, is that the waffle plates can be ordered separately, so they can be replaced.  Hopefully, in the near future Cuisinart will offer the option to order the grill/griddle plates separately, too.We hope this review helps.

  My old Cuisinart Griddler Express finally gave it up after about 15 years of dedicated service. I am totally blissful about it's replacement. I have only had this for a few weeks, but in that short time I have really put it through its paces. This is as elegant as it gets. Tonight I did a big burger. I used the sear setting. Perfect browning. Juicy. I put it on my glass stovetop so I can turn on the fan and vent the cooking scent. My previous Cuisinart didn't have removable plates and this is a HUGE feature. Although the plates are dishwasher safe, I would never in a million years put them in the dishwasher. A quick soak in the sink with a little Dawn gets them squeaky lean. clean. I'm not sure that I will ever use my outdoor grill again. Fast to heat up, plenty of power, and to me, a serious bargain. OMG, I can now indulge in my favorite Reubens at home. Carmelized onions? Yes!!! Totally recommend, 10 stars!

  We've had ours for about a year now and this is what I have to say about it:- The center knob broke off. So I have to force it on to switch from panini to grille.- The plates are easy to take off and clean but cleaning under the heating elements are next to impossible.- The grease catcher has only a 3/4"" catch cup at the back where the plate only has about a 3/16"" lip. So grease never ends up in that catcher . It ends up all over the counter.- The plates heat up unevenly. So food cook time can vary wildly.We bought this to replace an old George Foreman Grill. That was a mistake. It does it's job but it does it poorly.

  After much research, this griller was the one I picked and I couldn't be happier!!  I love to shop Amazon, but if I can get a product in the store locally, I will do that.  Wal-mart had these on their shelves, but they charged almost $15 more for it and they no longer price-match (can't compete with Amazon!).  So yes, I had to wait 2 days for shipping (loves me the Prime!!) but I used it the same night and it was awesome!!  Follow the directions on heating so you don't overcook your choice meat.  My wife is a charcoal-grilling expert and loves to grill that way, but when there is bad weather outside or we need food fast, this grill is the way to go and now she uses it more than me!!  I love the dual purpose grill plates and they are so easy to clean!!  I've done pannini, grill, sear and griddle and have not been disappointed on the end product.

  I really wanted this to be as good as other people said, but cannot agree or understand how this got so many good reviews if it performs this poorly.I've tried three times now to get a good burger that is seared on the outside without being over-cooked.  Twice with frozen 1/3 lb patties and once with unfrozen 1/3 patties.  Both times by the time they had even a little outward sear, they were so over-done they were tough!  That is difficult to do with burger!The failure with this devise is two-fold.  First, the heating elements seem to be sub-standard with low heat points and high heat points for a very uneven overall temperature.  Second, the grill plates are so light that they do not retain any heat.  They have to be made out of pot metal they are so light.Doubly disappointed because I bought the waffle platters as well.  They do work, but by the time you have a fully browned waffle it is also over done.  Cheap pot metal, light as a feather, that retain no heat and heat unevenly.The one redeeming quality of this grill is that it is very easy to clean with removable grill / griddle / waffle trays.I would return this but was told that with the Covid scare, no returns were being taken.  Buy from a store because you cannot trust online sellers it would seem.  If I could give no stars I would have

  The product itself is great, my wife and I love grilling on it and do so almost every day. It cooks everything well and being able to use the different sides of the plates it awesome. I can grill steaks and burgers on it, or flip them over and make pancakes or use it as a press for sandwiches. Its easy to clean and easy to use. There is only one bad thing and this is a really bad thing, the plates wear out fast and there isn't a good way to get replacements besides buying another grill. We have purchased this grill 4 or 5 times now mostly because we needed new plates. The last time I bought it I had tried some knock off plates that didn't work well and I think I saw some official replacement plates but they were almost as much as a new grill so we just bought the grill. So I would say its excellent while it works but once the plates wear out might as well buy another one. Don't expect the plates to last a long time.

    Not impressed so far when used as a griddle
  
",3.0,A. FAN,"Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2018","









  
  
    
  Purchased this primarily for making pancakes and grilling meat during the winter months.  I'm giving this a three star rating for the following reasons:I've only used this twice, so perhaps my opinion will change over time with experience.  But, not impressed so far when used as a griddle. I first used it as a grill to make hamburgers, and then as a griddle to make pancakes. The hamburgers came out good, but the pancakes, while cooked through, did not brown and looked pasty.  With the second batch I used an oil spray and the pancakes on the bottom griddle did brown but those on the top did not and took several minutes more per side than those on the bottom to cook.If you want easy access to the plates for flipping or stirring, you need to turn the griddler sideways on the counter; otherwise, you have to reach over the bottom plate to reach the top, and the top is under my cabinets, which does not make for easy access and is not recommended by the manufacturer.  This puts the dials sideways in an awkward position.It does take a long time to preheat.  I started off at 375° for the pancakes, as recommended, and it took a full 14 minutes for the ready light to go off.  The batter was ready in about ten minutes.  Like watching paint dry.You are supposed to preheat with the grill/griddle closed.  When I went to open it up to the flat position for the griddle, I burned my hand on the side of the top plate while trying to get it in position.  And, I was being careful.  Then, they took well over four minutes per side to cook.  A square fry pan is faster,  but I can cook only four small pancakes at a time.  Was able to fit eight on the griddler, which was the only plus that I saw.Finally, the griddler plates take a good twenty minutes to cool down sufficiently to handle safely.  I'll use a fry pan in the future if I don't have an hour or more to get through breakfast.

  This is very poorly made. Leaks grease everywhere. Ones side is always sloped so you cannot make eggs like it shows. The grates do not fit perfectly together and parts of the metal were deformed. The corners do not fit right. The way the grease is made to slide into the grease drain does not work if you are using both sides. A lot falls through the cracks if you open and close it.  We tried burgers and grease leaked under the grate plates and it was a disaster!

  I was really excited for this because I watched a YouTuber make a bunch of stuff on hers for like two years.It ended up being really disappointing. I cooked everything I could come up with on it for the last month and a half.Pancakes, Hashbrown, Grilled Vegetables, Etc. And it all turned out like 2/5. Edible but not very good. Pancakes wouldn't even brown.Nothing stuck for like 3 weeks, and now everything sticks. I have not ran it through the dishwasher. I hand washed with a gentle sponge. I used a silicone spatula to get food off. Week 4, everything sticks. It already looks like the plates are worn down. I don't see the point of a non-stick if it sticks. I left it on longer as people have suggested, that once it's FULLY cooked, it will unstick. It did not work, it just charcoaled and stuck.The heating element doesn't stay high. It needs to constantly reheat itself so the light is going on and off during cooking even though I preheated it and it was green before I put the food on.It feels kind of cheap and is rough around the edges. You can see that the form molds weren't perfect and they didn't do anything to smooth it out. Mine came with a small scratch on top of the stainless steel, but I got over my ego and decided to spare the environment over it.Some people have commented about the tray. It's fine. I don't see anything wrong with it.I wish it was bigger. I was surprised how small it was. Can't fit much on there. It's for 1 person max.I can't return it. I am not sure what to buy instead, but don't by this one. I remember growing up we had a griddle that cooked pancakes perfectly. You will be frustrated with this one.

  This griddler works pretty well. The plates are easy to remove and clean and the interface is easy to use. I'm finding it a bit low powered, having to cook most everything on high or sear. But it gets the job done.One thing that I'm less pleased with is the distribution of heat. The heat is spotty on each side and the bottom is far and away more powerful than the top. Like the bottom can burn before the top starts getting colour, which is very unfortunate. I'm having to flip things over to get them cooked evenly, which kind of defeats the purpose of a griddler.If that was fixed this would be a good product.

  I really like the Griddler and would give it 5 stars if you could flip the plates over for a lined pattern like many Panini grills have.  It heats up great, with even browning over the sandwich.  There is one other issue.  After heating, if you have a thick sandwich, you have to touch the hot lid to release it's hinge so it will lay flat instead of on an angle.  This is a little dangerous, you need a pot holder,  Look at the product photo and you can see the lid is normally angled but it has a release lever so it can move and float on its axles.  But it's stiff, maybe over time, it will loosen.

I mean perfect.And then you clean it up and you clear the drip tray every so often and that's it. Super easy to clean. Between this gadget and my insta-pot I hardly use the stove anymore .The only cons: uh, the very top of the machine gets pretty damn hot, obviously - the top heating coil is right underneath that housing. I have noticed the bottom heating element is stronger and more consistent when using the griddle sides of the plates (when making pancakes). Metal utensils seem to scratch the plates - I switched to plastic spatulas for this guy. Getting extremely tall stack sandwiches to melt down between the press is an art - sometimes the angle of the top plate makes it difficult to not push the sandwich diagonal.All in all - I love this thing.

  I bought this after buying a Panini maker from another manufacturer who I was very happy with but the product just wasn't big enough. I wanted a product that I had more control over and trust me the Griddler gives you that and more. I love the fact that you can remove the plates and that you can grill and use it as a stove top for breakfast meals. And the fact that you can remove the cooking plates with the push of a button and clean them in the dishwasher is a plus. I myself have found no reason to use the dishwasher as the coating on these plates pretty much wipes clean in regular dish soap.  So far I've just used the griddler for mainly Cuban sandwiches  and they are outstanding. Unlike my previous panini maker the griddler opens up wide so that you can cook even large cuts of meat in it. All in all I am extremely happy with this product and if you love your sandwiches cooked to perfection , this is the product to buy!

  I made only one fairly decent burger before this the Cuisinart Griddler convinced me to return it. The burger came out fine, but later in the evening I decided to scramble some eggs on the grill. Forty-five minutes later, and easing up the heat on the Griddler from ""Medium"" to ""High"", and the eggs were still slime. The plates were cool enough that I could touch them with my bare hands.The other downside I noticed, while make the eggs, is that the griddle pitches hard to the grease trap/pour spout. Eggs, pancakes, or anything else that initially runs will run straight to the grease trap and off the griddler. I imagine this would cause lopsided waffles as well.I read the reviews, and took a chance that the negative reviews were hypercritical. They are not.The Griddler is poorly constructed. All the hinges and moving parts are loose and wobbly. The unit itself is very light and feels cheap. The top seems like stamped tin.The heating element underneath is not setup to distribute heat evenly. While cooking the burger, the front facing ends of the griddler was noticeably hotter than the rear (near the grease trap/spout). This is because there really isn't any heating element present to heat that area. The ends of the heating element connects at the rear corners, near the center of the rear edge, but leaving a gap that doesn't heat properly. This is great is you want to cook some items slower than others, but is very frustrating for cooking one item evenly.Still, that is only an issue as long as the Griddler is actually working and heating your food. Which in the case of the scrambled eggs -- it did not.I wouldn't recommend this product to others. I won't be buying another, nor will I try any other version of this product.

    Great alternative to a griddle
  
",4.0,JoDee,"Reviewed in the United States August 19, 2016","









  
  
    
  We got a folding griddle for our wedding 11 years ago, as well as a waffle maker with interchangeable plates to use as a grill or a sandwich maker. These items worked great for us all of this time, but the non-stick finish started to wear and peel so they needed to be replaced. No one makes a folding griddle anymore, which was really frustrating. We used it all the time and have a small kitchen with very little storage, so having something compact was very important for us. Throughout my searching I kept seeing this one pop up and kept avoiding it because I really don't want a panini maker. After searching for weeks, I finally gave in and decided to give this a shot. We purchased the waffle plates separately as well, figuring we could kill two birds with one stone.I've been pretty happy with this. When you open it up you have your full griddle, although it is a bit smaller than your standard size which can make for some messy pancakes or fried eggs. The waffle maker plates are great as well, and clean up is simple. You just take off the plates and throw them in the dishwasher. The run off catch basin seemed weird to me at first, but then when I used it as a griddle and saw how it had to drain it made a lot more sense. The grill works nice for some marinated chicken, burgers and I also made some zucchini and summer squash that turned out really nice, grill marks and everything.The ONLY downside to this is that it does not heat evenly. The side of the griddle that would be the top of the panini maker when it's closed is considerably cooler than the side with the controls on it, which can be very frustrating when you're trying to make a big meal for a bunch of people and want to move things along. That being said, it does the job and I feel like it does it well. It folds up nice and small to put in the cabinet and I was able to replace two units with just one, so that was an added bonus for me. I still haven't made a panini on it yet...

  Love making panini on this. Use it mostly for pancakes, sometimes bacon, and omlets. But for omlets, you need to close the little drain spout in the back where the grease drains.  We just wedge a mushroom piece in there. The only issue is the griddle doesn't heat up quickly or evenly. The base side seems to be hotter and more evenly heated than the lid side, if you open it up flat to cook pancakes on both sides. We fried eggplant on it recently for eggplant parm and had to switch the pieces around from lid to base to get them all cooked the same. Definitely lower/slower on lid side.  But no problem for panini, somehow.Easy to use, clean, assemble. Sometimes I need to use the wooden handle of a spatula to level the top over a panini, as it needs a little help swiveling to lie flat evenly over the bread after pressing the release button.

  This is absolutely my favorite kitchen gadget right now. It works great as a panini press and I've made quite a few different types of sandwiches with it.The big win for me is how easy it is to cook boneless skinless chicken breasts. We try to not eat too much beef or pork for my dad's heath, so we tend to cook a lot of chicken. This has been such a blessing. I slice the breasts in half to make them thinner, then I season them with whatever mood I'm in (last night was ginger, garlic powder, turmeric, cumin, and dried basil), and let it sit for about 15 minutes. Heat it up on grill to medium high, and cook it with the lid closed. I always check the temp with a thermometer, and they are done in no time with nice grill marks. Since it cooks both sides at once, you save so much time and it ends up cooking nice and even and stays moist. The family loves the results.Clean up is sooooo simple too. I've had times where I forgot to pull the cooking plates off at night to clean them, and even after sitting overnight and I've never had to scrub hard to get anything out.

It ends up cooking by just the warmth left on the grill plates. I have to adjust my expectation of grilling. It's not BBQ.I called Cuisinart for someone to explain to me what I am doing wrong and the person had to get the manual in order to tell me anything.

I was worried that this would be big and bulky and ugly/overwhelming on my counter but it is not.  It is a great size. And the plates are small enough to store upright in an upper cabinet (like a book)  For those of us making chaffles it works great for them.  I wish Cuisinart offered more plates for it!

  I've had my Griddler for more than a year now — it's convenient, especially for making grilled cheese sandwiches and quesadillas for the kids. But the heat is INCREDIBLY uneven across the plates. There's a gradient from hot to warm across both plates, and the upper/right plate is a significantly lower temperature than the bottom/left plate. This means that in griddle mode, pancakes take twice as long to cook on the right (and you have to rotate large ones or they're white on one side, brown on the other), and in grill/panini mode, you have to flip whatever you're cooking or it gets burned on the bottom before it's done on the top. So there's very little convenience compared to just using a cast iron pan that gets evenly heated across the surface.Additionally, the highest temperature, ""sear"", is nowhere close to hot enough for searing steak. Bottom line: Only marginally more convenient than a pan, and far from a ""close it and come back when it's done"" appliance.

    Great timer, slow to heat
  
",4.0,Jeff,"Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this specifically for it's time-&-turn-off function, and for its 4 plates.  I'm absent minded and easily distracted by the odd emergency (living in the country with livestock) so I wanted a timed device that would turn itself off even if I wasn't there to mind it.  And I wanted 4 plates so I could have a combination of griddle and grill.  I tried one that offered that option with two plates which one reversed/turned over.  Terrible idea unless I scrubbed the plate thoroughly first - otherwise the goo and detritus on the just-used plate, would dump onto the heat workings.  Yuk.I went thru 4 other counter-top grill/griddles in 6 weeks, and stuck with this one.  It is the slowest one to reach full heat, but still worth it and best.Great size for a mini-kitchen, and great simplicity for a can't-cook old bachelor.

  Our old panini maker died so it was time for a new one. Its the perfect size for our family of 3. Super simple to use, heats up fast and most importantly-  easy to CLEAN! the plates come off and the drip tray slides out for easy peasy cleaning. Cooked an entire Flank steak on sear in just a few minutes and it was delicious, tender and juicy.  Also, we love us some grilled cheese sandwiches and those little slider burgers. We can make 6-8 sliders at once! It takes me longer to cut all the tomatoes and onions and get out the assortment of mustards then it does to cook on this thing. I definitely recommend this to anyone who is thinking about it.

",4.0,Girth Brooks,"Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  It works really well and it's convenient. But mine when opened all the way, even on a flat surface doesn't quite sit level. This wouldn't be a huge problem, but the drain spots on the grill are EXTREMELY tiny, and the lip of the plates is very short. So combine a short lip, with insufficient drainage, and you get grease/oil overflowing over the edge instead of in to the drain cup. Now have it sit on a slight angle, and watch the grease roll right past the tiny drain spot, and right over the edge of the griddle. I really enjoy it, and for things like chicken, or sausage, eggs, or even low fat burgers, it works fine. But anything with real grease and you have problems.

    Update. Took away a star. :(

  First impression...just ok. Packaging was very good and it arrived in new, unused condition unlike some other reviewer's experiences. Aesthetically it is attractive, but the housing is thin, so appears that it could be easily dented and scratched. The mechanism that holds the plates in place is poorly designed and the likelihood that the top plate will fall out and injure or burn someone when lifting the lid is dangerously great. The heating controls worked well and it heated quickly for my first panini on it. Also cooked in reasonable time. The unit was easy to clean. Do heed the ""hot"" warnings.The panini was darker on the bottom and both sides were lighter towards the back of the sandwich. However, it was cooked and had lovely grill marks. I think I overcooked my sandwich (ham and cheese on sourdough) because the bread was more like cardboard. Crispy tough on the outside and soggy inside. Honestly, it was a horrible fail for a first attempt. The dog fancy, in which I participate, would call this ""handler error"". I cannot hold the appliance responsible for my inadequate skills.I also ordered the waffle plates, which is why I wanted this appliance in the first place, and should receive them this afternoon, so may be having waffles for afternoon tea.I have time to experiment with recipes and methods, so not giving up just yet. I wanted to be wildly happy with this but really was a bit disappointed.Bottom line, the construction is unfortunately not Cuisinart worthy, and I need to address my own expertise as a chef.Will update if anything changes.UPDATE:Wah, wah. Took a star off. I bought this to replace my old griddle/waffle maker T-fal that is probably 30 years old and still works. The waffle plates were just too gummed up with cooking spray.Anyway, I got up this morning, excited to give this one a try making waffles. Followed the directions carefully. Did not use cooking spray.First waffle (400 deg for three minutes) was dark and somewhat crispy on the bottom while the top was barely browned. Second waffle was cooked at 425 for 3 minutes. Started to burn on bottom while top was soggy and light. Ran out of batter (see last two photos), so one quarter was barely done. Both attempts turned out soggy, half done waffles.I really wanted this machine to work, but I think this is a deal-breaker. I love my waffles so it's heartbreaking. Cuisinart obviously put a lot of thought into aesthetics, but none into function.I feel like I have to give it at least two stars because it arrived in good shape and except for heating unevenly and plates that are barely held in, it does cook. Will probably donate to grandkids when they go off to college rather than paying to ship back. That would make those awful waffles and inedible panini pretty expensive.

  We've had this sandwich press/griddle combo for several months and have used both configurations. This is a great little appliance. Actually, it's not so little. It easily fits several pieces of meat or several sandwiches in the press format, and the double griddle is very nice for pancakes or sausage. Heat is very evenly distributed and it heats up quickly. Super easy to clean because you just pop the plates off. The handle is nice, too. Our last two sandwich presses just had a little notch you lifted. Easy to burn yourself! We're very happy with this purchase.

  Ok so this product is not worth the money I spent on it. Does the griddle and all that but there are few down sides:1) if you use the top plate in loose fashion to make a sandwich, it doesn’t hold its own weight as a result the top bread of the sandwich slips and you get a misshapen sandwich2) not easy to wipe clean, the non stick coating is not good enough that you can wipe with a damp cloth and it will come off, rather I am afraid most times that the coating might come off3) tried to use it to make bacon strips but the temperature distribution is not even and the strips literally stuck to the plate.Not good enough for me

  Cuisinart, Cuisinart, Cuisinart please read this and I would like a free one when modified. okay, we know every manufacturer wants the grease and fat to roll off your meat and give you a little healthier meal. great, awesome. but here is the first thing it needs is adjustable legs in the back, why? legs in the back that screw out and can't come off all the way so you can't lose a leg. so one Saturday morning you are making eggs on it ( as you see in the picture above with eggs false claim) watch your eggs hit the surface and now right before your very eyes, the eggs run right toward the little grease slot and you lose 90% of the egg. your kid starts crying and yelling, you lost their eggs. The second would be to have a switch or push button on the top part when you are using just the bottom for two people. making eggs and bacon. trust me with these two modifications this would be the best-selling griddle. putting a button to control the top half saves electricity, makes the upper half safer when not using it and you can also use the offside to place your items. can someone tell me how you have the brains to manufature something like this and don't try it out before you sell it, how can you not know that the FN eggs will roll off the surface and right out of the back of the appliance. use some common sense when making products Cuisinart, really wow. this is a FN joke

    Great Panini Grill but Dangerous
  
",4.0,Chuck from Dallas,"Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2018","









  
  
    
  I really like this panini grill, but it has a serious flaw.  The outside top of the grill gets as hot as the inside, so the slightest touch will seriously burn you. This is worsened by the fact that when you open the grill after preheating and you need to close it with food inside, the top is not positioned for food, so you may need to adjust it slightly.  If you adjust it but you forgot your oven mitts you just *seriously* burned yourself.  Picture opening your oven preheated to 350 degrees and pulling out the oven rack with your bare hand. Serious burns!This was an inexpensive unit, so I give it four stars anyway. Just be aware. The more expensive units allow you to preset the angle of the top so this isn't as big an issue for them.

  I've now had the griddler for about a year so I thought I'd write a review. I like that I can flip the plates over and have a flat press or a grill style press. The plates are super easy to clean and even after a year of hand washing the coating is non-stick and easy to clean. The temperature setting is a nice alternative to simply having a ""low-medium-high"" knob, but you do still have this knob as well. It is simple to pop the plate off to rotate or clean it. The grill heats quickly and the fat/run off catcher is easily removable for cleaning.My only complaint is that when you open the griddle up all the way (i.e. both plates are suppose to lie flat) the plates don't actually lie flat. No matter what I've done they still slightly lean towards the grease run off. This wouldn't be a big deal but since it doesn't lay flat eggs or batter runs straight for the run off slot which means you have to either find a way to block the run off slot or constantly use a spatula to prevent the batter from running off. This is incredibly frustrating.

  I did not have an outside grill at our summer house so I read about this ""griddler"" and thought I would give it a try. I love it. There really is only myself and my husband, so for two people it is perfect. I did make turkey burgers for three people one night, I get 4 or 5 medium burgers on the one side ( 1 lb of meat) .  The first time I used it I made pancakes and it wasn't great because I didn't have the  plates hot enough.  I have since been able to make better pancakes.  I love it for the turkey burgers and I have made hallibut, and it came out perfect!  I am not a great fish cooker, and this made me into a pretty good chef. They were moist, had grill marks and the fish was really delicious.  I also have made eggs, omelettes and paninis.  It is healthy, easy to use , versatile and easy to clean.  For the price, it can not be beat! This is light years ahead of the George Forman grill, cannot even compare. (someone mentioned that as a comparison and I had one like 10 years ago).  I will use this all year round, no need for outside grilling unless there was a party where we needed  to cook for a large crowd.

  I highly recommend this Cuisinart 5 in 1 griddle to anyone who want to cook gourmet meals without using too much effort. I have purchased this for more than one month and used it many times. I really like the product.The most times I used it for grilling chicken wings, chicken breasts and salmon. For grilled chicken wings, grill 30 minutes at medium power after seasoning. For grilled chicken breast and salmon, grill 15 min at high power.  The products would have crusty outside and juicy inside at these settings. The machine cooks upper and lower side at same time and it is very convenient. It warms up fast.I also used the griddle function for pancakes. I used 425Fo and it worked nicely.The removable plate make it is easy to clean. The little plate under the cooking plate receives oils during grill making cooking less messy.

  I have been using this for over 3 months now and I feel like that’s enough time to write a review.Some reviewers complain about the plates coming off the clips and I do notice that problem on the top one if it’s not pushed in really hard. When I’ve just loosely pushed (thinking I applied enough pressure) my top plate has slipped off. But every time I’ve taken a second and pushed in harder than I feel necessary, it has no problem.It’s SO easy to clean- the plates are dishwasher safe.We’ve used this for so many different things with varying results; burgers, hamburgers, quesadillas, paninis, burritos, hashbrowns, pancakes, eggs and an epic fail, would not recommend haha- taquitos (they pushed them together too hard and everything ends up spilling out the ends).Overall this was an incredibly worthwhile purchase. Makes things like grilled cheese and burritos taste so good and it’s just so convenient. Would definitely recommend.

  Received replacement in two days.  Now works like a charm!  Made potato slices 3/4 inch think and they were scrumptious and evenly cooked all the way through with nice grill marks on top and bottom.  Then made two paninis (with room to spare) and had same results. The plates snapped off very easily and came clean with a quick soapy sponging and rinse.  Love this appliance!First review-  I have another panini that I used quite often but it was small and difficult to clean. It does do a great job with vegetables and paninis but the grill plates were not removable.  My hubby and I decided to upgrade to the Cuisinart Griddler for a bigger cooking surface and removable plates.  After it arrived, I immediately set out to grill some asparagus and then two paninis.  I then realized when i had to flip the asparagus to get grill marks on the up side and the paninis weren’t browning on the top or even had browned grill marks that something was wrong.  After the unit cooled, I removed the grill plates and opened the unit to full grill.  I tried the unit with both knob controls and sure enough the top plat was warm but not glowing red like the bottom plate.  I contacted amazon and after verifying with Cuisinart that the top plate was defective, they immediately sent me a replacement unit and a return code for the defective unit.  I will update when I get the replacement Griddler 4.

  I used to have a George Foreman but it got lost along the way with many moves across the country. I didn’t like the new design of those grills so I looked at other brands. This one is perfect for my needs. I really like that the plates are double sided with a grill and griddle. Being able to open the unit all the way up is also really nice. I’ve used this to grill veggies, grilled cheese sandwiches, make pancakes, hash browns, eggs, warm tortillas, grill burritos, and sear fish. I don’t eat meat or use a lot of oil in my cooking so the lack of drainage away from the food does not bother me. There is a small drain at the back of the unit with a tray to catch any liquid, however if you’re expecting this to be a George Foreman style drain you will be disappointed. For me it works perfectly though. There are also waffle plates that can be purchased separately if you need those. I already have a great waffle maker so I’ll pass on that.

  Having purchased several electric cooking products, and other cooking items billed as ""easy to clean"", this is the very first one that actually IS easy to clean. Just remove the 2 cooking plates, and rinse clean with hot running water. This gets most of the cooking residue, then brush clean with a little soap for a few seconds and that does it. Whatever coating they use does not allow things to stick very long. Even steaks, chicken, pork chops, etc. come clean with no sweat. Oh yeah, and it also cooks very nicely! I use it nearly every day and it does a great job. I read another review that said the locking tabs that hold the cooking plates broke. I have not had any such problems. Just in case, I always press the release button for each plate to release the locking tabs rather than just snap them in or out. You can immediately see that the unit is a very well made and sturdy product. My only one complaint is that the temperature control knobs have almost no friction... that is, when you rotate the potentiometers to set the temperature, they turn as if they are not connected. They work fine, however, it just seems a little out of place for such a well-built looking machine. Nevertheless, I am very pleased with the unit.

It heats up fast and has much versatility.For best results, use leaner meats of uniform thickness. 70/30 burgers cooked great, but there was SO much fat that it couldn't channel into the grease catcher fast enough and splattered the counter a good deal. If you're trying to cook meat with uneven thickness, you will get unevenly cooked meat.

Cuisinart replaced it and because of California consumer law, did not even charge shipping.  Great, except the replacement was DOA.  The next replacement still did not heat properly, pancakes gradually browned with a hard crust.  Now on my third griddler that did not work I called ""customer service""  to see if I could talk to a technical person to find out what is wrong.  You cannot get past the customer service rep, who did offer to give me a full credit to apply to the purchase of a different model That sounded great until they now insisted that I pay for return shipping.  Since my cost of shipping would be about half the cost of the product (and possibly against California Consumer protection, I just told them to send me yet another GR-4n.  It is here, does not work well, and they have yet to send me the return shipping authorization.  I think Cuisinart has decided that it is more economical to build junk than quality and then replace how ever many fail..  Another quality brand trashed.

  After first usePROS- Easy unboxing, unwrapping, and setup. Packaging seemed adequate for safety without feeling excessive. Scissors or cutting pliers for a zip tie are recommended.  Didn't really need to read the manual.- Preheated to 350 F within minutes. Clear indicator light on the temperature knob showed it was ready.- Cooked 12 oz / 1"" steak to medium in 5 minutes, then cooked a serving of asparagus in 3 minutes. Didn't need to reapply cooking spray, and the food came off the griddle with no effort.- Lid was easy to lift.- Steam / smoke was less than expected (helps that I patted down the food before cooking).- Not expecting any drama with clean-up (letting it cool first).CONS- As others have said, the top griddle can drip juice at the back when the lid is lifted up. I may have missed a drip pan back there. If there isn't one, a foil boat should resolve that moving forward.NEUTRAL- Meat had grill marks but not a heavy char. My mistake for not setting to Sear in the last minute. Will report back if the results aren't satisfactory.OVERALLWould recommend for cooking meals for 1-4 people (based on initial impressions). Will report back if the product fails before the extra 4-year warranty expires / I run into any quality control issues.

  Really difficult to keep very clean. The grill plates clean very well. The grease catcher cleans well in the dish washer.Problem all the little nooks, crannies, indentations, corners and the like have a tendency to collect the fats and grease thrown off by the high temperature cooking. The plates too not completely seal the cooking area. A portion, but in amounts large enough to be a problem collect around the grill in the nooks, crannies,indentations, corners and the like.No real way to completely clean except by complete immersion which is strongly not recommended.Keep a supply of q-tips for cleaning. In almost a year have found no other way to keep accumulations in check.As for cooking works really well. More than well enough to put up with the grease accumulations.

We grinded our own ground beef and put the Griddler on “Sear”. It seared the beef right away, all liquids were pouring into the container, it was draining excess fat perfectly and it took probably 5-7 minutes to make the burger well-done. It was juicy and delicious!Cleaning was a piece of cake! I don’t know why people complaint that it’s a crap or that it’s hard to clean. Well obviously you don’t scrub the plates with forks and metal scouring pads! If food got dried so badly on the plates, soak them in hot water for a few minutes and that’s it. Another complaint that I saw is about plastic clips that hold the plates. Okay, I honestly wonder where this people bought this Griddler. It either a Chinese knock off of it or something else, maybe different model.. The one I bought is the one with dripping tray that goes inside under the Griddler and I have metal clips.  Other people complaint that it splatters everywhere, okay, does your skillet splatter when you cook? It’s a hot, open surface, so when you put a piece of juicy something of course it’s going to splatter! Every single griddle does that! Or somebody said that it would turn off on its own or something like that, well it’s probably an electrical problem, it happens. I got an expensive table lamp and it did not work, I returned it and ordered another one, the same exact one. Things like that happen, it doesn’t mean it’s a bad product! Maybe it got damaged during shipping!  I’m just mad how people find one thing they don’t like and say it’s crap. It doesn’t have timer like some George Foreman Grills, but it doesn’t mean it’s a bad Griddler. It is not some super-duper fancy Griddler but it does perfect job in anything. It is a GOOD Griddler, It is super easy to cook with, super easy to clean. And don’t freak out if it splatters a little when you put a piece of steak on it and then give it one star and say ""Oh my God, I hate this product!""Out of 4,076 reviews only 290 gave it one star. That’s pretty good. So just use your common sense and don’t rely on those reviews that say It’s “crap” or “doesn’t work”, and make sure you get the right model.

  I really love this grill. It's so much easier to clean, and heats more evenly than my old Foreman grill. My last Foreman was a newer model, and the ceramic coating didn't last 3 months. I received a replacement, and the same thing happened. I decided to try the Cuisinart ""Griddler"", and I couldn't be happier. I've learned to adjust cooking times, compared to the suggestions in the book, because what I'm cooking is not always what they describe. That, however, is the only adjustment I've had to make. I highly recommend this item.

  This grill/griddle never achieved hot enough temperatures to cook properly in a decent amount of time. A batch of eggs took 15 minutes (after the 6min. warm time for the thermostat) before the whites were done, and by then, the yolks were rock hard.  The grill part wasn't much better. Frozen hamburgers (which were no problem on my old George Forman grill)  spattered all over the place from the sides of the machine when the top was closed over the patties, and the fat filled up the grooves before it started to drain.On the plus side, the machine is very attractive, and Amazon's return policies for Prime members are top notch.Given the 1000's of positive reviews for the GR-4N 5-in-1, I'm disappointe with my experience. But in the end, this machine can't cook.

  I love this little grill!  It makes perfect hamburgers and so much more— so much easier than cooking burgers on a traditional grill and no flare ups from dripping fat or oil. I just put the burgers in the grill and set the kitchen timer for 8 minutes and walk away.I actually keep it on a little rolling cart in our garage to minimize cooking odors in the house.I’ve had it about three weeks, and so far I have used it for grilled vegetables (green beans, eggplant, butternut squash, Brussels sprouts), toasted cheese, burgers, and quesadillas.The grill plates really are non stick, though I sometimes use cooking spray.  Clean up is quite easy— just pop out the grill plates and put them in the dishwasher.  I also like the simple, easy to use dial controls.Preheating is quick— I usually give it about 4 minutes and it is ready to go.

  If you live in an apartment, this thing is amazing. I am a breakfast man and I hate washing dishes so the Griddler is perfect! I am way more impressed with this than the Foreman grill. Eggs are a little tricky since they tend to run to the drain. The grease trap under the unit is perfectly placed! If you want to keep this under a counter, you'll be shocked at how clean it stays. I have been washing the plates by hand and are not hard to clean, even after making bacon, sausage or burgers. You may be able to wash them in the dishwasher but I do not want to lose the non-stick coating. I have a laser temp gun and the plates heat evenly. I've gone through several (Foreman's, etc) and this is the number 1 electric grill on the market hands down.

  I think you usually get what you pay for, but not in this case. This should be a $39 item, and I’d give it another star. But that’s it. It’s messy and drips grease despite the drip tray. It’s underpowered when doing more than one burger. Worst of all is the grease gets under the thin hot plates into where the heat coil is and good luck trying to get it out. As a result of all this, the thing smokes like crazy so have an outside exhaust or extra smoke detector batteries. I’d try more money and better design next time rather than once good name.  IMHO

   Got this to make pancakes, and for that purpose, it's pretty convenient. I can make 8 medium/small pancakes at once. They cook at mostly the same rate, without any burning or undercooking.Temperature control on this, however, is not great. You must preheat for a few minutes and then get it back up to heat a second time after putting the food on. This can be an issue for things like eggs (don't do it), breakfast meats (if you like crispy), or anything you want to cook more quickly.2 Month Update: I have made dozens if not over a hundred pancakes on this thing, and it is such a time saver. I have also grilled some pretty tasty lamb. I just use it on full heat every time and it works great. Never have to add oil or butter. I also only wash the pans with hot water, and only the tiniest bit of soap if there is a lot of grease.

  There are a lot of kitchen appliances which you might get excited about, at first, and then completely forget about a couple of months later - I'm looking at you, breadmaker in the basement. This is not one of those appliances.I have used this miracle device multiple times a week, for over two years - and it still looks and works like new. A couple of reviews I've read mention that the coating starts to come off or that temperature is irregular. Again, after two years of use I have yet to see any of this myself. I washed the plates regularly in a dishwasher for at least six months, multiple times per week - no problem. Since then I have been hand-washing them -- no dishwasher. The plates show zero wear and tear. The food cooks in the exact amount of time, every time - without fail. I have never had this appliance break or not perform exactly like it's supposed to.The grill is very easy to clean and maintain - like washing a couple of dishes. The grease catcher works quite well and is also very easy to clean. Only downside is... if you're grilling a bunch of food at once, you do get some splatter around but nothing more than you might get from a pan on the stove.One trick I've learned is to keep a paper towel under the grill, which helps keep the surface under the grill clean. Just replace every week or two, no sweat.I am so fascinated by this device that I had to write a review. I primarily use this appliance to grill chicken and shrimp and I absolutely recommend it to anyone looking for an indoor grill. Spectacular product and worth every penny.

  Bought it primarily to make grilled sandwiches (paninis). It does get super hot and melts the cheese inside the sandwiches,  but only *somewhat* toasts/crisps-up the outside of the bread... The bread NEVER gets browned. Not sure how it gets so hot yet doesn’t produce browning on the bread’s surface? We’ve tried different breads, with and without butter. No browning for some reason... We end up making toasted sandwiches in the old air-fryer more than this because of the lack of “toastiness” of the bread :(If you have kids (out clumsy folks) around, beware: the outside of the top **does** get super hot (we, the clumsy folks, learned the hard way)...A friend recommended this model, as she has it and loves it. She cooks pork chops and that sort of thing on it. So maybe it’s better for “grilling” than “panini-making”?

  I use this damn thing almost constantly, my only gripe is when they designed the grill plates for moving the grease and fat away and out of the grill, they could have done a better job. The edge near the hinge tends to overflow into the restraining clips because the plates are either not deep/tall enough, or there needs to be a deeper groove for managing grease flow. Wouldn't have hurt to make the grooves slowly get deeper further back on the grill side of the plate. Otherwise, EVERYTHING else is fantasticTL;DR: Awesome, but a little more messy than it should be.

  I've used the Griddler a number of times now to cook chicken and turkey cutlets. It's easy to use and the drip pan works fairly well. There is a certain amount of grease that splatters out of the sides (I was using it closed to cook the meat on both sides at once) so I put a large piece of aluminum foil underneath to catch the splatter. It cooked both the chicken and turkey cutlets quite quickly. They were done in about 10 mins or so. Cleaning the removable griddles was not difficult. I washed them by hand in  order to make sure they got completely clean. I haven't tried washing them with the dishwasher yet. Having the removable griddles was important to me and I'm glad I went with a machine that had that feature. Once I had the chicken cooked, I then put it on some good bread with some pesto and roasted peppers and lightly coated the outside of the bread with olive oil. I then put them back into the Griddler and used it as a panini maker. The sandwiches that came out were golden brown and really tasty! It's a quality machine and does a good job both as a griddle and as a panini press.

  I love this thing! I use it a lot. The trays are on a slight slope so any grease drips down a small dip on the edge and into the grease tray. Not a major slope like a George Foreman grill, it's barely noticeable. Being mostly flat, I sometimes have to help grease along into the dip if it's thick grease, like for hamburger patties, but that's ok. It's handy especially in the winter when you don't want to use a large bbq outside, and it's nice to have all of the pancakes ready at the same time. I spray it down first with cooking spray, but that being said, I haven't had anything stick to it. The trays are very easy to clean, and they haven't scratched. You can do two griddle trays, two grill trays, or one of each. I probably wouldn't use it for bacon because the sides are not very high and the grease may overflow, but I haven't tried. For improvements, the dip to the grease tray could be a little bigger, and when I cooked waffles, one side was a lot more brown than the other, so I guess the waffle trays don't cook totally evenly. (They are sold separately). All in all though I am very happy with it and would recommend it to anybody.

  Got this to replace my George Foreman that had the teflon flake off after years of use.  I love having the replaceable plates, and the functionality of being able to use this as multiple appliances is a great upgrade from the george.  This isn't just a ""George Forman Grill"" style device.  You can flip it open and use it as an indoor grill, or by flipping the plates you can use this as a indoor griddle when your stove is full (great for pancakes and eggs on Thanksgiving morning when the burners on your stove are all full.)Add the optional waffle plates and this will replace your waffle iron as well without taking up more space.  The plates take up less space than yet another machine.

The new model has a much better mechanism to keep the plates in place, which also allows to use reversible plates with different surface patterns (grill and griddle) instead of the two sets the old design came with. Also, the resistive heating elements now are encapsulated, which I am expecting to last much longer than the previous ones. So, I am bery happy with my choice.

Small problems:
*Griddle plate came scratched
*Plates very thin
*Knobs are that cheap, plastic, fake chrome
*Overall felt cheap compared to other Cuisinart products

Good:
*Very easy to clean
*Amazon rules at returns

The story:
I wanted to upgrade from my George Foreman and tried, multiple times, to love the Cuisinart Griddler. The concept is great, the engineering and quality is low.

We first tried to use it as a griddle, it started off fine, then pancakes started cooking slow, then REALLY slow. The thin plates really loose heat fast and the internal thermostat doesn't maintain the temp well.

With eggs we noticed lots of hot and cold spots, they cooked unevenly.

So, I figured no worries, we really bought it to replace the Foreman as an indoor grill. It came up short here as well.
It took MUCH longer to cook anything from frozen on the grill. Turkey burgers, chicken, it all took a really long time.

Bottom line:
Wanted this to be an upgrade to the George Foreman grill, ended up being flexible but bad at everything it was intended to do. Sad to see such a good design ruined by such poor construction and cheap materials.",

It cooks well, gets more than hot enough. I use it to cook steaks when I cant or dont want to grill outside. Does them FAST. This has variable temperature so you can really control how you're cooking as you get used to it.  I use this all the time it never gets put away. I'd recommend this one for the price. One downside is that it does not appear to cook the top side quite the same as the bottom when cooking  on the highest setting. Just something you need to be aware of if you want ""perfect"".

  If you're an apartment dweller and love the taste of grilled food then this is the appliance for you.• Choose any food you love to grill in warm months and you can now do so all year round.• The grill heats up quickly and food is cooked evenly.• A green indicator light on the selector knob to the far right lets you know the grill plates are ready.• There is minimal smoke emitted from this grill - far less than one would expect using an outdoor grill - rendering it highly useful for indoor cooking.• The grilling plates are easily removable and dishwasher safe.• The grill top cover can be adjusted to lie flat on the grill base plate to make panini.* Only one essential caveat: grease spills lying by the base section's heating coils (when the lower grilling plate has been removed) must be cleaned up as soon as possible to avoid the potential for the grease to short circuit the coils on the next round of cooking. (Unfortunate lesson already learned).Conclusion:• Great appliance for apartment dwellers (or homeowners) seeking year round grilling.• Easy to use, easy to clean.Highly recommended.

Now I'll spend the next several years trying to keep the thing level.  It worked well while it lasted, although I only use it for steaks and chops.

I know you can wash in the dishwasher, but i let them cool and hand wash them.- Really cool how you can flip the plates and have either a flat griddle or a raise grill.- The lid can pivot for sandwiches, or lock for grilling meats.- Both lids have a fat drip in the back that is great idea, Every griddle drips to the front, which i thought was great, but after using this one that goes to the back to the fat tray that is built in or should i say under. By the time i was done cooking, all the fat had been collected and you couldn't see any.- Can flip open to a full griddle, with allot of cooking area. You can have the flat plates or raised for burgers and steak. Still all the fat runs to the middle into the hidden fat tray.Another feature, you can either set the temp by (Sear/High/Med/low/Warm) or by (temp ”F)

We currently have a relatively small RV with limited space and we were looking for something with just this type of functionality.  This little guy has worked out great so far.  We've done our best to keep it protected while in transit but it still gets bounced around a bit.  Despite that, it hasn't failed us yet.  We've grilled burger, dogs and kabobs.  Fried eggs, bacon and sausage.  Even pressed a sandwich of two with no issues.

  Bought this a few weeks ago and 1st off if you think this is going to complete with top notch panini grill guess what, it's not going to. However it does work as described. I read reviews regarding the plate removal button and can see how this might be a problem, but I think if you push down on the plate before pressing the button it removes a lot of the harsh stress on it because the plates are spring loaded. We bought the waffle plates as well making it a 6 in 1 grill. Made some awesome buttermilk waffles with it. I have not had any problems with reheating or cooking whatsoever as other have in the reviews. For the price it is definitely worth buying.

  Keep in mind that this is a glorified two-sided frying pan, so set your expectations accordingly. Overall, I am very happy with it and would recommend it. Details below.Pros:- big aid in my attempt to loose weight. Cooks my vegetables and proteins without any oil.- very quick. The trick is to preheat. So I turn it on (""Sear"" for pretty much anything), and start rubbng/ seasoning whatever I plan to grill. By the time I am done, the indicator light goes green so the grill is ready. 6-7 min for veggies, 3-5 min for meat/fish, and a healthy, tasty, fresh and nice-looking dinner is ready. Overall time from getting into the kitchen to eating my meal is about 15 min -- unprecedented, and really awesome when you come home exhausted from work.- removable interchangeable heating plates. Cleaning is OK.- nice heavy stainless steel construction with lid that adjusts to the thickness of the food- possibilities are endless. Experiment!cons:-no timer. I don't understand how in the 21st century there is no timer on an electric cooking appliance.-it does set off my smoke alarm, so I had to place it on my stove under the fan; that did the trick.-small. Fits just enough for me and my never-too-hungry husband. May be too small for bigger families; definitely too small for parties.- obviously, does not give you a true grill aroma. You can use barbecue sauce a bit, but keep in mind that anything that drips off the meat will burn.Other tips:There is a booklet which is very helpful with cooking times, but some of the instructions are off. It takes a couple of trials for you to get a sense of your grill, so don't get discouraged by a few undercooked or overdried things. I wrote down adjusted cooking setting and times in the booklet, and now my grilling is failproof.Enjoy!

  Love my new grill!! My big George Forman was loosing the coating off of it. I wanted a grill where I could remove the plates and wash them. Because it’s just not cool trying to clean a grill off that doesn’t have removable plates. Like how is that even suppose to work!? This grill is the perfect solution.  It’s a win win! You can make it fold flat which is super awesome! I’ve cooked pancakes, hamburgers, and tortillas so far and haven’t had any issues with it. I also got the plates where I can make waffles. Haven’t used those yet though.

  This is a great indoor grill.  I've used it about six times so far.  I have a George foreman stand grille I was using that did a great job but I dropped the cover and it broke the handle, then the temperature dial is only heavy paper and didn't hold up well outside even though it was under cover.  This little cuisinart is very well made, easy to use and very easy to clean.  My only complaint so far is the handle doesn't fold down for storage.  Otherwise I really love it.  The drip pan works well and collects a lot of the grease.  I'm not sure why others had a problem unless it's not level.  I scrape the grill plates with the plastic scraper while it's still pretty warm and then wait for it to cool before finishing cleaning.  A little dawn dishwashing soap and a light wash and it's ready to go.  You can also clean the plates in the dishwasher.  More than enough room for food for one or two and more if open flat.  The food tastes wonderful.  I've made steak and chicken.  I'm not as much of a fan for simple grilled cheese but it's ok.

  Used it for the first time for cooking hamburgers. The sides of the grill plates are too short! The hamburger grease flowed over the tiny lip around the grill plates. A quarter inch higher on the sides would greatly improve this appliance. Cleanup was a hassle as well, due to all the nooks and crannies that grease gets into. The removeable plates are a nice feature. The ""stainless steel"" top is easily scratched. Would not purchase again.

  I've had this grill for awhile and end up avoiding it because it just doesn't get the job done efficiently.

  I LOVE this appliance!!!  It's so easy to use, the plates are easy to place, remove, wash... and it's all Dishwasher safe - for lazy people like me!!!A few reasons I reduced the rating were:1) the electric cord cannot be removed and it's not retractible - so you still have to do the wrap and twist-tie deal... And I plan to use this all the time, so it will sit on my counter (which is why a removable/retractible cord would be nice)2) the top surface gets VERY HOT.... I've only used this on Med - but I place it on my stove so my kid can't reach it.3) the sliding button (that releases the top burner to use the panini press) seems to not hold the plate in position well... frequently when I lift the top, the plate will remain in the horizontal position - so the grease runs off to the table surface ... I have to use tongs or a hot-pot holder to push it back up where it will click and go up in a vertical position (so grease will run into the container)4) the handle seems to be made of metal... but not a very sturdy metal - so I'm a little concerned about lifespan ... but that may be an unnecessary concern5) also - since I LOVE this appliance, I wanted to find more plates (so I could have at least one set to use while one's in the DW) - But I had a really hard time finding just the plates (and the ones I did find were $80)... so I'm somewhat concerned about getting replacement parts when needed...

  What attracted me to this machine were the removable plates, to make the grill surface easy to wash.The problem is that the quality of the plates is not high - they gradually started sticking about three years after the purchase. Since Cuisinart's warranty is three years, they won't offer a replacement, and each plate costs $50 - it's cheaper to buy a new unit! It's a complete ripoff.It's especially disappointing because a much cheaper Foreman grill I once owned never had this problem, and while it was not easy to clean, the surface remained non-stick for many years.Not a unit I would recommend purchasing, and Cuisinart has lost a lot of trust from me.

  We purchase this item after owning for the first time a panini maker made by Kolorik at a local super market.  We use the other unit every day  u can read review. The Cuisinart Griddler is a top notch well made kitchen appliance that does a lot cooking too near perfection. But I have to tell you it casn' t hold a candle to the Kolorik in making crispy bacon strips for our favorite: BLTs.  So in the short period we have made the following with great results.  Pork tenderloins, ribeye steaks, hamburgers, chicken breast, thick sliced zucchini, tomatoes, red onions and portabella mushrooms.  Buy the accompanying cookbook and watch YouTube videos to learn how to properly use it.  You do to have watch your food, bast veggies with balsamic dressing.  Otherwise It will turn out dry, so have side dishes near the ready.  You have to stay with the Griddler but you will not be disappointed.  Do not cook bacon on it, the grease catcher fills quickly and could be more than a mess possibly a hazard.  We have not tried fish and probably won't, broilling is best for fish. We have the Kindle cookbook and you can modify anything in that book to suit  your taste. We have not used it as a open grill for hotcakes yet, but no doubt they will turn out great.

  This is an ok device.  It is good for most meats and panini.  The major issue is the top does not get as hot as the bottom.  Nothing you do in setting can correct this.  It isn't the end of the world because the top does get hot but the bottom will cook at a different rate.  The aftermarket waffle plates (not by Cuisinart) are terrible and don't work. Which is a shame because they were a big part of why I went with this unit.  The waffles stick no matter what I do and the waffles are always ruined.  This is a good replacement for a foreman type grill and will work ok as a griddle, but overall I'm disappointed with the consistency in cooking temperature and underwhelmed by its use as a griddle.  It's bad for bacon because the griddle plates have a lip around the edge to prevent grease spills.  Unfortunately this prevents the top plate from making contact with the bacon resulting in even a greater disparity between the cooking on the bottom and the top.  You still have to flip the bacon or one side will be burned and the other under done.

  I was excited to get this Panini Griddler as we have used and worn out two previous different brands.  Thought I would try this one.  Big mistake!  It looks like it would work until I tried closing the lid on a nice loaded sandwich.  It would push my sandwich out and since the top was so hot I would have to open the lid and get a fork to push the sandwiches back into place.  Also, the second or third time I used this as a Panini maker, the top would not brown so I would have to flip the sandwich to get the other side brown.  This defeats the purpose of a Panini.

  BUYER BEWARE: This has received a lot of positive reviews, and I loved that it had all the features I wanted. Pros: easy cleanup with the removable plates you can use either on grill or griddle sides. Drip tray works very well, even in open position. Con: the really important part, the HEAT, does not work well in the open mode. I took a chance and bought it having seen that in some of the other reviews, but some reviewers said that preheating as instructed eliminated the problem. Not so for us! We loved it the first two times we used it, once as a closed contact grill and once as a closed Panini press. Tried to do pancakes and sausage--- took all @#$% night practically and had to keep closing the unit again to get it back up to a useable temp. The fat from the sausage actually got close to solid a few times, the unit got so dang 'cold' (plates still felt hot and you could've easily burned a finger, but it wasn't hot enough to cook the meat). Disappointed with the fact you can't really use it in the open position, so I may return it (recently purchased) and hope that the replacement unit will work better. If it doesn't, I guess my two choices are either to keep it for contact-grill only or return it altogether. Not sure which I'll do.

  Received today, one day ahead of delivery date. Item looks good, well constructed and above all simple to use. Short receipe book enclosed with some intresting eats. Have not used griddle yet but feel certain, based upon experience with Cuisianart products, it will perform well. Excellant price and has three year warranty from date of purchase. Of course you must register item with Cuisinart. Large enough for two grilled sandwiches or large steak. Small enough to be out of the way when not in use. For $87.00 with delivery by FEDEX, whats to lose?Jan 31 2013  Used the grill for first time today. Two rib steaks about eight ounces each. Used grilling plates on sear setting. The cook book recomends 5 to 8 min on sear. At five minutes flat steaks were well done. This bad boy cooks quickly so be careful. The next steaks will be on high to slow down the process. A couple points on what I read from other buyers comments. One complaint was that the hooks which hold the cooking plates in place were made of plastic and that they would melt from the heat. The retaining hooks on my grill are metal, pot metal to be sure, but metal. The cooking plate release button is made of plastic, however does not engage the hot plates. The other complaint was the red and green light cycles on and off. When I turned the grill on, the red on light on the center control lit up. After heating, approximately four minutes a green light lit on the grill control, the right hand control, to show the grill ready. It went out with the introduction of the meat and did not come back on. The machine however, cooked up a storm. Be sure to read the manual as the controls may be a bit confusing. The middle control turns the machine on and off. The left control is for open face griddleing. In essence the machine works almost too well. More to come as I learn this baby. CheersFeb 11, 2013  A couple of weeks have passed and the grill has been used a little more. Be sure to free the top cooking head, two releases on the sides of the closing handle, to ensure even cooking. This allows the upper plate to apply even cooking to the item being prepared. To leave it locked will cause the food item to cook unevenly resulting in over cooking the rear and under cooking the front. Really a nice little rig which makes slam dunk grilled chesse and ham sandwiches. Cheers

",1.0,C H,"Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2016","









  
  
    
  I'm so disappointed with this. I spent a lot of time reviewing panini makers and chose this one for it's versatility. The problem is in it's design. First, the grease doesn't drain because the only place for it to drain is about a 1/2 inch groove that easily gets clogged with drippings that have bits of bacon or ground beef in it. So you have to constantly push it through to drain it.Also, the top doesn't lock. It unlocks to allow it to pivot so it can lie flat on a thicker item. It's also supposed to be able to lock into place. Well it doesn't. Remember the aforementioned 1/2 groove? It drains into a drip tray off the back of the grill. When you open the lid and it won't lock, it doesn't line up the top plate's groove into that tray so it just drips all over the counter while you fumble to hold it in place.This doesn't cook evenly, either. Best test is grilled cheese. If you close it, put it on Grill, and let it sit without flipping, the bottom browns very quick before the top is done. And there seems to be no difference between Grill and Griddle settings. They are the same, just labeled differently.Complete waste of money. SO SO disappointed.

  We are in the middle of a kitchen remodel & I splurged on this to help make meals while we're without our other kitchen appliances. I am beyond delighted with how handy it and the use we've gotten out of it already. After ordering the waffle plates I'll be able to get rid of my griddle and waffle iron and use just this one small appliance. I've so far used it to grill burgers, sausages, cook eggs, make panini sandwiches and heat up meals. I'm not sure what the negative reviews are about, this is the best appliance I have in my kitchen right now. The drip pan for runs is great and the ease of clean up is amazing. I'm so happy with this purchase.

  I should have bought this sooner.  I purchased one of these a few years ago for my daughter who was starting grad school and she used it extensively.  I finally decided to give it a try because I got a hankering for fresh panini sandwiches and this is exactly the appliance for that and many other uses.  It cleans up faster than a skillet.  I have used it for large hamburger patties and just made a breakfast with it... perfect for bacon.  Recommend egg rings because there is a slight slope for draining grease.  Not suggested for cooking bone-in meats such as pork chop but just about anything boneless is fair game.

  Love this Griddler! Easy cooking for everything from chicken to steaks or, grilled sandwiches. I used the Griddler to also make paninis, waffles & pancakes. Makes the best bacon ever without grease splatters . Pretty great little small appliance to add to your kitchen. I Especially love the easy clean up with the removable plates. Separate grease catchers are not required since the new design makes the grease-catching unit integral to the grill.Please click below vote if you found my review helpful so I can improve them to help others like you.

",4.0,Chris M.,"Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2018","









  
  
    
  I like the size and flexibility, but the drip tray for grease collection is designed for form over function.  PRO:There's a lot of grill space compared to my old Foreman.The reversible, removable plates are a joy to pop out and clean (no more balancing the Foreman over the edge of the sink).I haven't used it in the folded open position, but it's nifty having options!  CON:The drip tray is neatly hidden away, but that limits its functionality:  - It is quite small (don't expect to do more than a pound of 80% lean hamburger patties).  - The collection point is at the back, where you can't see what's going on...  - There is no way to see how full it is (short of spinning around and trying to peer in from the back or removing the tray).  - There isn't a good way to empty it while in use.  (I made room to shove a saucer against the back to catch the drips while I pulled out the tray...)It can be tricky to position items to get the top to level off when closed

  I had one for a year and was so sad when  it stopped heating.. I figured i had a lemon.. I like Cusinart products so I decided to get another one.. This one only came with one grill plate and one griddle plate, my last one came with 2 of each so when you make a Pannini you get the grill marks on each side.. Plus this plate is thinner and cheaper quality.  Very disappointed in the decline of their products.

  So far it has cooked everything amazingly, even thick steaks, cooks sausages really fast, makes excellent pancakes, and grilled cheese sandwiches are a snap, cleanup is a no brainier with the pop out trays just put then in the dishwasher.  Don't know why I didn't buy one of these sooner.  The only drawback I can find is the drip tray, it's not very large so you have to monitor it closely if your cooking something like bacon or other things with a lot of drippings, but that wouldn't stop me from buying another one if the need should arrive.

    A Outstanding Design, But Badly Flawed! (See Update.)
  
",2.0,HonestAbe,"Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2011","









  
  
    
  We started by purchasing one of these for ourselves from Amazon, and quickly purchased a second as a gift for my in-laws - having Amazon ship it for FREE right to their door almost 3,000 miles from us.  We experienced a fairly serious warping of one of the two griddle plates.  It warped upward on the grill side right where grease should drain to the reservoir below the unit.  This wasn't good since grease won't flow uphill and, were the steak or burgers greasy enough, would lead to grease overflow onto the sides of the Griddler itself.Both Amazon & Cuisinart were extremely helpful - shipping a replacement to us in just 2 days without even having to return the faulty part.  Since then one of the plates has developed a much less serious warping in the same place, and we're keeping an eye on it.As for the in-laws' Griddler it had a problem in that the plate release buttons had to be pressed VERY hard to get them to release.  We were visiting them shortly after sending it to them and, once we saw their difficulty in removing the plates, we called Amazon.  Again, Amazon & Cuisinart couldn't have been more receptive and Cuisinart sent a replacement unit with return shipping label for the faulty one.  The replacement arrived before we had to go back home - a period of about 3 days.  Since then they use it often and have had no problems.As for the cooking performance, the Griddler excels compared to rivals such as George Foreman.  Where it excels is in its ability to sear the outside of the meat before it is done cooking.  Our big George Foreman would cook a steak to an unpleasant shade of gray, where steaks cooked on the Griddler have that striped, grilled appearance you get from an outdoor grill.  And it is very, very fast.  Once heated and ready to cook it takes about 3-4 minutes for most anything you're grilling.The George Foreman, however, is better at draining grease since its cooking surfaces are tilted downward - making good use of gravity.  The Griddler's dual purpose design will not allow for that same downhill tilt.  Speaking of that dual purpose, we have never used the griddle side for anything, yet, so we can't say with certainty how well it cooks eggs, pancakes, bacon or whatever.  But, I can't see why it wouldn't do a fine job since it does have temperature controls - something lacking on most counter-top grills.P.S.  Amazon had the best price and shipping was FREE.  Go Amazon!!UPDATE:I am sorry to have to report that both removable cooking plates, yes even the replaced one, have now warped!  In fact, the warping is so severe that it's bad enough, when heated, to cause the plates to release themselves from the spring-loaded holding clips - while cooking!!  Trying to reconnect it with a sizzling steak and red-hot elements attacking me is no fun - believe me!This makes the product unacceptable after a few months of occasional cooking, even though it was excellent when new.  I will now contact Cuisinart to see if they are as willing to help as they were when the first warping problem occurred during the warranty period.Sadly, I've had to downgrade its rating from 4 stars to 2 stars.  It may go up to 3 if Cuisinart proves helpful.

  Terrible purchase for the price. Does not heat quickly or cook food quickly such as chicken unless you put the top grill on top of the food. It is messy and the grease from the food  does not flow to one spot so it goes all over the counter. I regret buying this and will purchase something cheaper but better made.

    This Grill Won't Last Long
  
",1.0,glory darios,"Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2021","









  
  
    
  I used this grill to press sandwiches most of the time, I also used it to grill chicken breasts. It was great at first. Easy temperature controls and had enough area to fit two sandwiches at the same time. It was also very easy to clean.However, after about one year of use, it stopped working completely. It would heat up at the beginning to reach the set temperature, but won't maintain that temperature. It starts cooling down and won't work again. I tried turning it off and on to see if it will start heating again, but that didn't work. I tried using other temperature settings…nothing worked. The only way to get it to heat again was to wait a very long time (like an hour), at that point, it only heats to the set temperature before it start cooling again. This wasn't a one-time-only flaw, it started happening after about 8 months of use, and kept happening more frequently until the grill became completely useless.  So if you are looking to buy a product that will last long, I recommend you look for a different grill.

    Great griddle, but the plastic clips are a major design flaw
  
",3.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2012","









  
  
    
  We have had the Griddler for a year and a half. There are things I love about this Griddler, but there are some serious flaws as well. We recently had to replace it under warranty.Pros:1. I love the reversible plates. I liked having the option of using it as either a grill or a griddle, but I didn't like other products with many different sets of removable plates. One simple set of reversible plates was easy to store.2. The coating on the grill was very good. Whereas the nonstick coating on our old Foreman grill wore off quickly, in over a year and a half the plates looked as good as new.3. It cooked food very evenly and it was easy to adjust the temperature as needed.4. It was very easy to clean with the removable plates and removable drip tray.Cons:1. The grill plates were held on by plastic clips that melted after a few months. We still were able to use the griddle for a long time even with the deformed melted plastic clips. But the clips eventually broke off entirely. This is why we had to replace it under warranty--the plates were no longer being held on by the plastic clips, rendering the device inoperable. Whoever designed the griddle to use plastic clips to hold on hot metal plates wasn't thinking very clearly!2. The dials on the front of the Griddler also came off very easily. This wasn't as much of a deal breaker because we could easily pop the dials back on, but it still was annoying at times.3. The 3-year-limited warranty worked great for us because we live in California--but anyone outside California would have to pay approximately $20 in shipping to get a replacement product.Now to share my experience with the Warranty: When I called to inquire about the warranty, I was able to connect immediately with a customer service representative. It was nice to not have to wait. She told me that they would replace the product but I would have to pay for shipping. I told her I would have to think about it. After thinking it over, I decided that I would pay the shipping to have the product replaced because $20 was still less than a new product would cost. But when I called back and spoke with a different customer representative, he told me that because I lived in California I didn't have to pay for shipping for the return. They sent a deliveryman straight to my house to pick up the package off of my porch and I had a new griddle within a week. That was fantastic. But only because I live in California.When I got the new Griddler, there was one difference I noted from the old Griddle, and I'm curious to see how this affects the performance. Our original Griddler had a heavy, cast-iron grill plates, but the new version had lightweight grill plates (aluminum I guess). It does cause the plates to heat up faster. I don't know if the non-stick coating will last as long with these plates. But I'm hoping the lightweight plates put less pressure on the plastic clips so that the griddle will last longer. I have only used it a few times--no problems yet, but I will update this review if any issues with the new product turn up.

    Most Used Cooking Device in the Kitchen
  
",5.0,Kurt Schwoppe,"Reviewed in the United States April 3, 2016","









  
  
    
  Three months in and I love this Griddler.  It was bought it for paninis, but it is now the most used cooking device in the kitchen.  In addition to any type of sandwich, we've grilled everything on this from pork chops to chicken breasts to hamburgers to thin strip steaks.  Because it is double sided grilling, there is no flipping and food gets cooked in half the time.  Was real surprised at how well it did hot dogs and brats - once again, no flipping or even rolling around.  For cheeseburgers, just use the handle to keep the upper grill slightly about the cheese, and it quickly melts in less than a minute.  It even works well with marinated items like teriyaki and BBQ sauce.  Even better is that cleanup is a breeze.  The griddles cool off in the time it takes to eat dinner.  We just throw them in the sink and use a nylon bristle brush to quickly work the ""gunk"" off, then wipe them clean with a soapy sponge.  Use the same method to clean out the grease tray.  So far, it seems to be holding up real well.  Clearly it was my best purchase of 2015

  This is great device for grilling a small steak or chicken. Good even cooking. It is also good as an all-in-one compact way for preparing a breakfast of bacon, eggs, and pancakes or for making French toast.  The accompanying recipe booklet has recipes fro Panini sandwiches as well, although I have not tried them yet. Cleanup is very easy. The only drawback I have found has been gauging the amount of time needed to warm up to the desired coking temperature. I’ve found letting it heat up for 8 to 10 minutes is best for most things so far.  I think this could be a very useful cooking tool for RV’ers. It’s efficient, cleans up easily, is versatile, and does not take up a lot of room.

  I'm sorry to say that I wasn't impressed.  I bought this because we just  renovated our kitchen  and I didn't  want  to fry bacon, sausage, eggs  etc.  that would make a big mess.  I heated it up as instructed (about 10-12 minutes) placed  sausage links on the grill, only to find that it was not hot enough to cook them, or anything else for that matter.  There is no way this would  have fried an egg.  I moved everything over to my stove and continued cooking it.  Next I tried pancakes.  They were pretty good, but not as hot as it should have been;  an old time individual griddle is much better.  As far as paninis, they cooked them but they were about 1/8th of an inch thick;  we like our sandwiches a little heartier that this.  For  $100 this was a huge disappointment.  I would not recomend this product.  I hardly ever use it.  Good thing I have a brand new kitchen.  The only feature that I did like was easy cleanup.  I also found that the knobs for the temperatures to do the same thing.  What's  the purpose of that???  Save your money, or buy a George  Foreman.

    Want an Indoor Grill?  Do You Feel Lucky?
  
",1.0,Stair Climber,"Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2015","









  
  
    
  This is a review of the Cuisinart GR-4N Griddler.  I was excited because I thought with this many positive reviews the GR-4N must be better than the cheaper grills made by the x-boxer.  I have owned many of those cheaper grills which eventually fail to stay hot or are too small.  Unfortunately, like many cheaper grills my GR-4N would not get very hot and would not stay warm.  Pancakes were pathetic.  I ended up trashing the pancakes and made them on my stove with a couple pans.  Then I tried frying a couple eggs on the flat plate.  The eggs rolled to the back of the plate and drooled off the back of the unit onto my kitchen counter!  This happened because the cooking plates have a really lame micro lip instead of a lip of any substance that actually keeps food, grease, fat and other liquids on the grill instead of your counter.  Secondly, the plates were not hot enough to cause the eggs to quickly solidify.  Bacon took forever and much to my disappointment Cuisinart does not recommend closing the cover to cook bacon.  What?Here are my lessons learned after years of frustration using inferior indoor grills.1. If you want an inexpensive indoor grill the cooks decent, don't get removable plates and don't expect a large cooking surface.  Don't expect any fancy features or dials.2. The easiest way to clean an indoor grill is with a damp towel while the grill is still warm/hot.  Don't be 'E.coli paranoid'.  The heat kills many germs.3. The most even heating can occur when the heating elements are actually embedded in the plate$.  You will need to pay for this design if buying removable plates or for less money get a grill where the plates are not removable.4. Most non-stick surfaces peel sooner or later.  Depressing.5. Due to the high failure rate and poor performance of so many indoor grills even some pricey ones, I suggest for a pricey grill you get an extended warranty (maybe with SquareTrade) or just buy the cheapo grills instead and expect to replace them when they fail.6. The quality control on the manufacturing of indoor grills must be pathetic.  You'll see many 5 star reviews but then many 1 and 2 star reviews for the same model.I give Amazon 5 stars for allowing me to return this 1 star grill (free return shipping).  So my latest gamble is with a Breville BGR200XL. I can get a 3 year warranty for $21 from SquareTrade after a 25% discount.  I'll review it in the future.

I didn’t drop stars because as far as I understand US 120V outlets just can’t provide enough power to heat it stronger. Probably that’s why electric stoves use special 240V sockets.This griddler fits great to cook breakfast (eggs, sausages, bacon). Toasts come out nice and crunchy.

Especially since I have to use them to swap to grilling, waffle iron plates and griddle.  Cooks even and fast. You can put out grilled sandwiches in no time sure beats standing over the stove!

The waffle plates are great, Wish I had bought this sooner. Such even cooking on this! I just wish they would have used a better quality button for changing the plates.  Hope Cuisinart upgrades this and makes i so they can send us a replacement to purchase so we can fix this annoying problem this is something that is err on their part.

  This is the second time that I’ve purchased this griddler. I bought the first one for my own home and we love it so much that we bought a second one as a gift for our son. He lives in an apartment and wanted something to cook burgers, hot dogs, etc. on that would be easy to clean and wouldn’t make a big mess. We both love how easy it is to use and clean. Neither one of us have had any issues with it.

    Terrible Design I Should Have Payed More Attention To The Negative Reviews
  
",1.0,methylamine,"Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2012","









  
  
    
  We had a beat up old foreman grill that needed replacement. I looked on amazon for a foreman grille and the griddler came up with good ratings. I ordered one and when it got time to cook it was a miserable failure. I'm used to the foreman grills sloped draining design which as you know drains the fat/juices from the meat. Well this piece of crap griddler is perfectly flat so the grease just sits there on your grill. There is some sorry sloped notch towards the back of the grill plate that is supposed to drain the grease into the rear bottom grease trap. This is so terribly designed. Besides the fact that the grease really doesn't make its way to the grease trap, when you open the grill the top grill lets the grease fall down onto your counter. After using it 4 times to cook hamburgers already the top of the grill has dingy yellowish grease marks that are really hard to clean. One of the worst part of the grill is that if you are cooking something fatty the grease will shoot out all of the sides since there is no lip to prevent grease splatters. The way the grease collects in the back causes it to get into the actual internals where the electric elements are which is a huge pain to clean.Some may like this but I wasn't happy with it. A Cheap old forman grill did a better job and was way less messy.I threw the griddler into the trash.

    Great multifunction cooking device
  
",5.0,DZ1073,"Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2012","









  
  
    
  I love the compact design of this device.  It is much smaller and lighter than my old indoor grill, yet still has more grilling surface.  I also like having temperature controls - something my old grill lacked.I first tested the grill side of the plates with a thick piece of meat.  The grill heated up in less than 5 minutes.  Unlike other reports of plastic latches for the plates that melt, mine appear to be the same type of metal as the plates themselves, probably aluminum.  Not wanting to take chances, however, I used the high setting at first and turned it up to sear for just the last few minutes.  The meat was still partly frozen when I put it on, but the grill held its temperature for about two minutes before the green light went off, and took only two more minutes to get back up to temperature after that, which is not bad in my opinion.  The hinge design is great.  With my old grill, I never would have been able to apply even pressure from the top with a piece of meat this thick.  The grill marks were also much better.  When they say sear, they mean it.Next morning, I used the griddle side of the plates to make pancakes.  Much easier than doing it in a frying pan.  I don't have the waffle plates yet, but they are on my Christmas list.  The multifunction capability was my primary reason for getting this device.  My old grill had removable plates, but this was just for easy cleaning.  It had grill plates only, and no griddle or other plate types were available.So far, I am definitely happy with my purchase.UPDATE:I have since gotten the waffle plates, and absolutely love them.  They make four waffles at a time, but two is really enough for one person unless you are really hungry.  I use a store bought batter mix instead of the recipe in the included book, so it took me a few times to get them the way I like them, but I have it down now.  After nearly a year and a half of regular use, this little grill is still going strong.

  The main reason I got this was to cook a vegan patty for my daughter. The patties are breaded and they take a long time to cook in a pan and they need such a high heat. With this grill I have been making chicken panini's, chicken sandwiches all over the place and it is really very easy. The drip tray is very conveniently out of the way but I can see that it could overflow if you are cooking something really juicy or if you just totally forget about the tray entirely.

  I looked at a boatload of grills for years and just never liked anything for one reason or another.  Although this one isn't perfect, it's close enough to get 5 stars from me.I am not a ""hand wash only"" person.  I'm lazy.  If something can't go in the dishwasher, it better be because it's too big.  This one does just fine.  The plates come off easily and take up no more room than a dinner plate in the dishwasher.  They've cleaned up well with no issues so far even though others have mentioned longevity issues with the coating.  I'll update the review if I see that.It takes a while to heat up to ""sear"".  ""Sear"" may be a bit optimistic a term.  It definitely gets hot though.  Once at ""sear"", my plates still smoke (probably the coating) so I put the pre-stamped 1/3 pound frozen burgers from Costco on immediately.  (Hey, I already said I was lazy, so I'm not going to do them from scratch)  The burgers are medium rare in 5 minutes.  Medium in 5 1/2 and well done in 6.The ""almost perfect"" comes in the drip area.  I like the design.  Well done with minimal additional space.  It may just be my countertop, but there doesn't seem to be enough rearward lean angle to make the liquids run off to the back drip area.  I just put a 1/4"" wood strip under the front feet and it solves that issue for me.  I can live with that and would buy it again knowing that.

  This is so much easier to clean than my old GF grill that didn't have removable plates.  Most of the time, a rinse under running water gets any gunk off.  Only downside so far is that the temp controls are a little confusing as there is with temp markings and one with low-high markings - if both are on, which setting will grill go to?  Does it matter which plate I use? etc. .  I think one control with both markings would be easier.  I'm tempted to get the waffle plates.

  I just received this product and I used it as a flat griddle to make arepas, which worked very well.  I tried to scramble eggs on the griddle but there is a slight tilt to the plates so the eggs ran into the drip tray.  I'm currently testing this product against the Krups Precision Grill.  I'll be cooking ribeyes tomorrow and that will determine which product I keep.  I really like the size and versatility of the Cuisinart Griddler.  There's a mistake with the selector knob on the unit that I have.  It should say ""GRIDDLE"" on the left and ""GRILL-PANINI"" on the right.  Instead, the selector knob matches the grill-panini knob.  This doesn't affect the function of the unit but it makes me question Cuisinart's quality control.

",1.0,Robert Alan Pearson,"Reviewed in the United States June 19, 2013","









  
  
    
  The unit has one obvious design flaw.  Grease sits on the bottom plate and will not drain properly.  Not a huge problem until recently when the cooking plates seem to have lost their coating and meat will stick unless the plates are sprayed with PAM beforehand.When cooking is done and the unit opened beware of grease spattering everywhere including in your face.  This is no doubt a result of greasing with PAM but if you don't the unit is worthless and cannot be used.We loved this appliance until the plates wore out.  Shouldn't they have lasted more than a year?  I doubt I'll buy another one.UPDATE: We are so unhappy with the appliance at this point we are ready to toss it in the garbage.  The plates have lost all their coating and have warped to the extent that the grease settles in the corners and has no chance of draining.I can't believe this piece of junk is still on the market.

  We recently replaced an old George Forman grill with the Cuisinart GR -4NP1. What a difference in cooking time and cleaning. With the removable grills on the Cuisinart, they can be placed in the dishwasher where as the Forman could not. Burgers, steak, and chips cook in a matter of minutes and the cooking liquid is collected in an internal removable tray which is much nicer than our old George Forman where the tray was set in front of the grill and relied on gravity to collect the excess liquid - much cleaner with the Cuisinart.

  Updated -The new one did not have an issue with the same part that broke off another unit.  I have used this many times and like it much better as a grill than as a panini maker.  I've found that many times the bread doesn't brown - it just gets hot and somewhat mushy.  I'm not sure if I am doing something wrong.Received this tonight.  Was very excited to use it right away. Panini's for dinner!  The unit is pretty hefty and seems well built except for a few plastic pieces. And therein lies the problem.  On the right hand side of the unit's top plate there is a black slide lever that releases a lock so the unit can open to a flat position. When I was trying it out before use, it worked fine.  However, after heating up the unit and cooking dinner I let it cool down as instructed and then went to open it flat also as instructed to remove the plates for cleaning.  The plastic lever broke right off.  I requested a replacement in hopes that this problem is not inherent to the product. If it happens again, I'll update this review.  I rated this a 3 because of the potential quality problem - but it worked great on our panini's.

  We have several Cuisinart products in our kitchen to include an older Griddler version that continues to work very well.  Bought 2 of this new model with high expectation (one was to be a gift),  The new model does not obtain or maintain cooking temperature.  Just when items start cooking the griddle cools and does not reheat until almost cold.  Took 35 minutes to cook 5 slices of bacon after 10 minutes warming time.  The book says it is a great way to cook breakfast for 2 people or a large family.  At the rate I experienced, some of my family would get breakfast close to lunch time.  Returning both griddlers.

    Outstanding grill with understandable limitations
  
",5.0,410,"Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2009","









  
  
    
  I am impressed with this grill and find it far superior to my old Foreman grill.  The plates detach for cleaning and the top plate can press down at variable heights/angles to adjust to the height of whatever you have on the grill.The temperature adjuster is a great feature to have and the grill heats up within 5 minutes to its maximum.  I've been using it mainly for paninis and grilling.On nonstick finishes:  I have read some complaints about the nonstick finish and suspect some users are not quite aware of the limitations and proper care of nonstick cookware.  In general, nonstick finishes are not so much ""poorly designed"" (as one reviewer puts it), they just have real life limitations no matter what brand you use.  Even cast iron, fairly durable, has its own limitations.  Be suspicious of complaint reviews that don't suggest a better alternative. Nonstick finishes WILL break down the more you use it and the higher the temperatures.  You might just be looking for a product that just doesn't exist.Nonstick surfaces show best longevity if oiled just before food is placed on them.  Furthermore, temperatures above 500 degrees (around the max setting here) cause them to break down a bit.  So don't grill something messy on these at max temperature if you want them to last.  The nonstick finish on this is a little less potent than on some cookware I've used, but I suspect this is because of the higher grill temperature they are expected to endure (so users won't get flecks of Teflon on their food).  I shouldn't have to say this but I will:  You can't expect to use metal on nonstick surfaces (knives, scouring pads) and expect it to last.  I've had this about 6 months and use it 2-3 times a week and the plates are still in great shape.  Bread and sandwiches clean up easily.  If I am going to cook something messy and don't want the hassle of cleanup, then sometimes I use aluminum foil.  You still get a nice set of char marks.

  Dissatisfied in every way.  This replaced a prior Cuisinart unit that was ready for replacement after several years of use:  its surface was wearing out etc. Bought this unit due to removable trays for easier cleaning. However, it has several problems.1. Heat level is inadequate.  The heating units are too small or too far from the trays, and it takes forever to cook anything, and the heat level is insufficient even to brown a paninni. I suspect the air flow between the trays and the unit also contribute to uneven, spotty and inadequate heating. The only area that's useful for cooking is about a 4 inch circle at the center of the tray.2. Construction is flimsy compared with the other Cuisinart unit it replaces.3. Takes forever to warm up, based on the inadequate heating elements.4. While it is acknowledged that it is not intended for cooking eggs or omelets, on the prior unit you could do this, on this one you can't: the drain function prevents it. Also, the ridge around the edge of the trays are too shallow: so the product runs off the edge and over the side.5. Ridges are too shallow and flat to cook pannini's.I rarely return items but this one is going back and I'm going to find a replacement that has removable trays and will be more useful.  This unit needs a redesign with better trays, better more even heating, and perhaps an adjustable height on the rear legs so you can either use it in 'drain' mode or not.  Or an adjustable drain fence.

",5.0,Jen,"Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2014","









  
  
    
  We had the smaller version for a year and a half before we decided to upgrade to this model.  We thought the larger surface would allow us to cook meats more evenly and we found the idea of waffle plates appealing.  We used the compact one at least 2 or 3 times a week on average and have continued that with this one over the three weeks we've owned it.The controls are easy to use and operation is mostly intuitive.  I referred to the recipe booklet only for to get an idea of what they suggested for different items as far as cooking with the griddler closed or open.  When I follow those recommendations, my food turns out just fine.  When I don't, it turns out okay, but sometimes it gets overdone on the outside before its internal temp is right.  Other reviewers have noted the thermostat goes on and off so that the temperature is not truly constant.  That may be the case, but it has not caused me any problems at all.  I will agree that it can be a little tricky to use in the open position.  The heat dissipates kind of quickly with the unit open and can cause problems when preparing anything more than 1/2"" thick or so.  However, closing the grill has not compromised the juiciness of any of the meats I've prepared:  steaks, chicken breasts, and pork chops so far.  And, if you really want to use it open, try using a foil tent to trap the heat.  That has worked well for me when cooking more food than will fit on the single plate.We are very happy with our purchase.  Macy's (where we first saw this) puts this unit on ""sale"" for more than Amazon wants normally.  Buying the waffle plates at the same time gave us an even better deal.  The waffle plates worked well, too.  We've owned several waffle irons and the only one better than this was a huge Cuisinart model.  The small compromise in quality is more than made up for by the space we save having it all on one unit.

  This griddle/grill is amazing. The only reason I took a star away is that it doesn't come with the waffle plates, which would make it my absolute favorite kitchen appliance ever. And they cost half the price of the griddle. But anyways, as to the griddle/grill. I got this for Mother's Day and have been testing it out in all of its many forms. I have grilled hamburgers, pork chops, made paninis, grilled cheese, used the griddle to make breakfast, and everything I have tried has come out fantastic! It cooks quickly, and grilled foods taste amazing! I was really surprised at how yummy the hamburgers turned out, since I usually hate the taste of indoor george foreman type ""grilled"" stuff. These actually tasted like they had been grilled, and were very juicy.The other thing I absolutely loooooove about this thing is the removable plates that can go in the dishwasher. That is the best feature ever! I always HATED cleaning our regular griddle because it had to be hand washed, and with care due to the electrical parts. Now I don't have to be so careful of it, and even hand washing is a breeze if I do it that way because stuff just comes right off the plates. The nonstick surface is really good. I usually just throw them in the dishwasher though, and then they are ready to go next time I want to use the griddle.

  I really like this product. I spent a long time deciding which panini press I wanted to get, searching reviews and product review sites. Eventually decided on this one and it’s awesome. I was a little wary thinking any appliance at this price point had the potential to be cheaply made. This is very sturdy, heats well and there’s enough versatility to make this purchase worth it. I find a lot of the time I’m cranking the heat past the recommended setting but it’s still very effective at grilling sandwiches or anything else. I’ve made perfect pancakes and French toast for the entire family all at once. Definitely a great investment I’m glad I pulled the trigger on.

    Great burgers, can't wait to try chicken
  
",5.0,Ra Ha,"Reviewed in the United States August 23, 2014","









  
  
    
  I've cooked eight burgers since receiving the Griddler yesterday.  Everything is great; from the high temperature leaving sear marks on the burgers, to how quickly the burgers cook!I will be trying boneless chicken breast soon, first with the grill closed after pounding to be the same thickness, and looking forward to trying the open grill too.The best part about it is that the clean-up is much easier than a regular grill.  The plates are removable, a feature I was looking forward to, and they are reversible with a griddle (flat) on one side and grill (with ridges) on the other side.  They are very easy to remove and put back, so easy to clean.I'm glad I didn't spring for one of those really expensive grills.  This makes making burgers as easy as making waffles - once I figure out really how quickly the burgers cook - less than 5 minutes is my estimate and they are 160 degrees!  An added bonus is being able to keep the grill closed while you check the meat temperature; can't do that easily with an outdoor grill.

  I thought if I purchased a Cuisinart I would be getting a good product.  But this appliance feels flimsy and cheap.  The whole unit feels like tin and as flimsy as aluminum foil.  The plates are very light weight.  The dials have a lot of play to them so I'm never sure if I have the setting correct.  It does not drain well even though it has a collection reservoir.  The lid does not stay secure.  Especially hazardous since it gets very hot.  The whole appliance gets very hot...not just the plates.  It is not worth the pricey amount I paid for it.  Very disappointed in Cuisinart.

  So far I've only used the Griddler to make grilled cheese sandwiches and waffles (with the separately purchased waffle plates). It heats up quickly and is simple to use. The waffles turn out perfect every time. I learned that when using it for sandwiches, regular sandwich bread is too thin and squashes down too flat.My only complaint is that the waffle plates should be included with it. If they came with it I would have given 5 stars.

  We absolutely love this little gadget. From beyond burgers to pancakes, grilled cheese, and more, this griddler is the perfect surface on both the grill and flat side. You do need a couple good feet of counter space to use it, and it needs to be pretty near a plug, but that wasn't a problem for us. Cleans easily and really simple to use. The only thing I'd say to take note of is that if you are a right-handed person the little catch to open the lid fully is kind of in an awkward place, and my husband got a light burn accidentally when his finger caught the side of the griddler trying to get that latch open. Just something to be careful of! But otherwise we adore our griddler and have told our friends who cook that they need one too!

  Overall I like the product. However, the bottom doesn’t leave grill marks on my bread or chicken tenders, so I’m thinking the heating element doesn’t heat up as much as the top. Also, some butter leaked under one of the grill plates and it’s impossible to get the baked butter from around the heating elements. Would have returned, but the return window has expired. It might just be the unit Amazon sent me, as others have no issues at all.

",5.0,CheleT,"Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2014","









  
  
    
  I read all of the reviews for the Griddler before buying it.  Considered buying the larger version but waffle plates are not available for it and this seemed like a good size for our family of 3.  Have had it for 2 days and have already made paninis three times and waffles (bought the bundle with the waffle plates included).  All came out great.  Highly suggest spending a little time reading he instructions and figuring out how the device works before trying to cook on it.  With (quite a bit of) versatility comes a small degree of complexity so it really is time well invested.  All of the food came out great.  Used ciabatta rolls and made a smoked turkey, avocado, tomato and cheese Panini as well as my personal favorite - the pesto, tomato and fresh mozzarella (twice because my daughter wanted one of these for breakfast!).  Made waffles for my husband.  It was fast easy and convenient and very quick clean up.  No issues with the surfaces heating up - another reviewers have pointed out you need to keep the grill CLOSED to preheat it,  HIghly recommended.  Looking forward to grilling some vegetables for dinner tonight.  Fun to use- quick - let it heat up while you are prepping your ingredients and follow the guidelines in the recipe book for heating times.  Will update my review if anything changes but I'm really looking forward to cooking on this and expect we'll be using it often.

    FANTASTIC DUAL GRIDDLER/GRILL!!!
  
",5.0,NJNANCY,"Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2013","









  
  
    
  I love this Griddler for so many reasons I hope I fit them all in. First, and probably my most important reason is that I have a black stove.  If I even boil water on it, it gets spots.  Frying is waaay worse.  This has an additional grill that does two things.  One, it cooks the item on two sides at once which makes it very fast and two, there is very very little spatter on my granite counter top.  Which cleans up a lot easier than the stove.  The top grill swings loose so that when you bring it down on an item it lands completely flat.  Another big thing is that it can be a grill with lines raised across it or you can easily detach & flip  the plates over for a griddle that you can do grilled cheese, pancakes, eggs, etc. on.  It also unlocks so that you can flip it back off itse4lf and it is doubly big which is great for pancakes or eggs or anything that isn't grilled.  Also, it has very efficient and easily used controls.  In the center is a knob for griddle one way, off up, & grill right.  The left knob is for the griddle that is marked with 250, 300, 350 degrees.  The right knob for the grill is ""low, med, high, sear.""  Ovens take so long. I live alone & this is great for single meals even though it is roomy enough for about 4 pieces of meat, fish, etc.  All in all it is great in so many ways.  I would definitely recommend it.

  I really wish I could love this grill but I can’t. What I do love is that the plates pop off for easy cleanup and is dishwasher safe.This is a very small 2 person grill. Yes, you can get 4 burgers in but honestly how often do you eat burgers. Two chicken breasts max is all it will hold. Thus far I seem to only be able to get a seat on one side unless I flip the meat.My other complaint is the way it catches drip. There is a small opening at the back where it is supposed to drip down and be caught by the drip pan. Most of the time I end up with the drippings all over the counter with very little in the pan.I’ve had a George Foreman before which I loved with the exception that I couldn’t take the trays off of it so it was difficult to clean.Still hoping to find that perfect indoor grill for quick meals.

    Better than a George foreman
  
",5.0,Brandon D.,"Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2018","









  
  
    
  Got this because I didn't want another George foreman after going through 2 different ones. I really love this one and the features it has. Have used it several times already since we got it a month ago. The removable plates make cleaning really easy. The only thing that seems like it could break is the bottom since it's plastic, just going to try to be careful with that, not a deal breaker. The others I've had had more plastic than this one. Like people have said, if you're cooking something greasy like burgers with the grill press and you open it up  it can make a mess behind it because of how the hinged lid works. However I found if you just use the scraper or a spatula to push the lid back into its snapped in position, there's no drips all over behind it, makes it into the grease tray that way. All in all so far it's the best counter grill we've had.

    Superb, just could learn one thing from the Breville. 4.5 Stars!
  
",4.0,Jacksonian,"Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2010","









  
  
    
  This grill is awesome, that is all I can really say. This one attracted me because it has the flippable cooking plates so that there's lots of versatility. Originally I was looking for a panini grill and an electric griddle, but after investigating electric griddles and using some at friends houses, there just didn't seem to be any good ones out there. Every electric griddle I've seen all just won't cook evenly because they are huge in surface area without having enough heating element coiled underneath to heat the surface properly, but not so with this wonderful machine. I was used to using The 

  
Breville BSG520XL Panini Duo 1500-Watt Nonstick Panini Press









  
  
    
  , which is a great panini press, I'll compare the two for you.Major Pros:Temperature control dials:You get full control of your cooking, unlike the breville machine which simply turns on when you plug it in and must be unplugged to turn off and it set to turn on hot, the Griddler has the ability to cook on low or high. I found this much better for cooking paninis because you can cook them on lower temps to make sure the inside of the sandwich is all hot and the cheese is melted, etc. then you can finish it off on hot to put those nice grill marks on the bread.The Griddle function:Not only is this a great panini grill/contact grill, but I'm sure it is the best electric griddle on the market. When you unlatch the top end to make it all lay flat you can fit around 10-12 slices of bacon on the machine or about 8 small pancakes, so it's not a terrible downgrade in size from your average electric griddle. The best part is that IT COOKS EVENLY! Unlike all the other griddles out there that have one big circular coil that leaves the center unheated the Griddler has full coil coverage on both sides for perfect cooking!Minor Con:The Lack of a Lock/Adjustment switch on the swing arm:The only way that the breville out does this machine is that it has a switch that allows the top surface to move and lock into positions that are more accommodating for a variety of sandwich thicknesses. If you cook a thick sandwich with the Griddler it will take a little bit of extra effort to make it turn out perfect, because the griddler will want to squish it a little more on the back side instead of coming at the sandwich from right above.Also, the same switch on the breville locks the machine shut so that you can pick it up with one hand by the handle and allows it to be stored flat against a cabinet or countertop wall, the Griddler will always have to be moved/stored in it's normal sitting position which takes up more space.All in all I definitely wouldn't trade my Griddler for any other panini grill or griddle. It's an awesome machine.

  Great product.  We've use it everyday!  I will admit I've purchased counter top grills before and before you know it, it's stored in a cabinet and somewhat forgotten.  We started using this product when it arrived about 2 months ago and we've literally used it everyday.  We've used it for both fresh and frozen meats, sandwiches, and the most prefect pancakes and bacon imaginable. The 3 cooking dials allows for a variety of temperatures ranging from 200 to 425 as well as  high, med, low, warm and sear settings. The  grill plates snap on and off easily and clean up is even easier whether hand wash or in the dishwasher. I definitely recommend this product.

  The minute I opened the box, I knew this was going to be perfect!Things I love about it (1) The grill panels are removable for easy cleaning (2) the grill panels are two sided -- with the griddle side and the flat side (2) It has a temperature control (3) It has an on-off switch so I don't have to unplug it (4) It has a removable pan that catches drippings (5) It can be used 5 different ways (6) its attractive enough to leave out on the counter.I made a sandwich today and it was great! The grill panels were easily removed and cleanup was simple. Highly recommend this model.I started using a sandwich maker about 18 months ago. Based on product prices and reviews I purchased two other recommended brands. Was very disappointed in missing features and griddle quality. I just threw out the second one because the teflon coating started peeling. I finally realized that if something doesn't last very long and you have to buy a replacement within a year, you don't really save any money. Better to shell out a few extra bucks and buy something that will last, with all the features you need.

  I was just about to pull the trigger and buy a competing grill press (rhymes with ""doorman"") when I started reading its reviews - broke after one year, uneven temp, hard to clean etc.  Even though it was a popular brand I couldn't look past those reviews. It also didn't have adjustable temp control or removable grill plates.  Not only does the Cuisinart GR-4NP1 have both of those things, the plates are reversible and the whole thing can lie flat.  So easy to clean.  I think I may order the waffle plates.  Very happy with my choice.

    cuisinart vs george foreman
  
",4.0,Arielle Hill,"Reviewed in the United States June 26, 2014","









  
  
    
  I had a george foreman before this one, and the hinges broke, so I replaced it with this one. The George foreman was bigger but had only high temp. This one has temp control from warm to sear. George foreman only folds over on a fixed hinge, this one is adjustable and lays open with reversable plates from grill to griddle. George foreman had the grease tray set right in front on counter easy to view if it full but also easy to bump and spill( I did many times) this one has tray slide into underneath, stays put but you can't see if it full. The sear temp on this one is not that high like on the George foreman so cooking is a little slower but not too bad. The george foreman was wipe clean that was the worst. This one you detach plates and place in dishwasher(amazing) then you wipe clean sides if you happen to make a mess. Over all I give this one a 4 only because it is a little smaller then I thought. But it is also looks good on the counter where the George foreman did not.

    Great, but a couple of design flaws
  
",4.0,,"Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2008","









  
  
    
  I have had the griddler for a couple of years, and use it quite often. I also bought one for my daughter for Christmas, and she loves it. I haven't noticed any problems with temperature drops as mentioned in other reviews, but I guess I have paid more attention to how the food cooks. I use the panini plates for most of the foods I cook, and have made a number of different foods.In the time I have had the grill and as much as I have used it, the teflon coating is still in new condition. I haven't been hard on it, though. I use a plastic or silicone turner only to remove foods. To clean, I wipe the plates with a paper towel as soon as I remove the food, and all of the cooked on food and grease comes off very easily. After the plates cool, they are washed with soap and water and dried. I don't put them in the dishwasher.Although I really like this griddler and use it often, I have two complaints. The top part of the unit has the floating hinge which is nice for cooking thicker foods, but it is held in place by two small round nubs on the handle that are too easily released. If you touch the top unit at the middle or bottom to wipe it, it releases and the plate can come down to burn your hand. I hold the top of the plate with a pot holder to prevent it from fall on my hand. The other complaint is that it is necessary to ""help"" the floating hinge when making a thicker grilled sandwich such as a patty melt or a panini. While lowering the upper grill plate, I hold the back of it with a pot holder to keep it parallel with the sandwich. If this isn't done, the upper plate meets the top of the sandwich on an angle causing the top of the sandwich and part of the contents to squish forward. I have figured out how to get around the two problems, so the grill works for me. Hopefully, this will help anyone with similar problems.As for spattering grease, that's what hot grease does. The solution would be to keep the heat lower for cooking, or to cook foods with less grease in them. I haven't considered this to be a problem with the griddler because the result would be the same when cooking bacon or other greasy foods in a pan.

",4.0,Thomas J.,"Reviewed in the United States May 1, 2014","









  
  
    
  After three months of extensive use the Griddler has done a really great job on just about everything I've cooked on it.  It really excels with steaks and chicken breasts and does quite well with sausages as well.  Bacon and eggs takes a little extra time but but still come out well.  The only thing I was a little disappointed in was cooking burgers on it (Both turkey and beef).  Because the plates are not at a slant, like other electric grills, the grease does not drain away from the burgers.  I kept my Foreman grill just in case the Griddler didn't work to my liking.  I'm glad I did as the Foreman grill is still the best, by far, for cooking hamburgers and turkey burgers.All in all, the Griddler is a great accessory for anyone (like myself) that doesn't have a chefs kitchen at their disposal.  If they can improve how the grease drains from the plates I would give it 5 stars.P.S.  Anyone with small children should make sure to keep them away from this device when in use as it gets very hot to the touch.  It will save you a trip to the emergency room for burns to little fingers.

  We have a hot dog stand that's open 14 hours a day 6 days a week and we don't even have a commercial grill. We have this little Cuisinart Griddler thing and although I've bought a new one as a back up recently, it's still in the box because the old one I bought almost a year and a half ago just keeps on working! I know, getting excited over a grill that's still running after one year might seem strange at first glance, but I doubt you'll be grilling every single day for 14 hours straight. That's some grueling grilling. Stretch that out into weekly grilling hours, that's a long, long, ridiculously long time.And here is another thing I've learned. If you're serious about grilling, you need a grill where the electrical connection is separate from the hinge. This one has a super sturdy and thick cable containing the wiring, wrapped in a protective metal coil, like a spring. Open close, open close, 14 hours a day, nothing happens to the wiring. Try THAT, George Foreman. HAH!Now one caveat. The non-stick coating on the grill plates is long gone. I don't know where it went. But it's gone. For my purpose, it's not a problem. It's most likely because I tend to really go to town on the grill plates every morning with that little scraper that comes with it, and a brush, but honestly this thing gets so much constant (ab)use, non-stick coatings don't have much of a chance. On the positive side, the grill is ""seasoned"" absolutely PERFECTLY for our use now.

  The unit was received in good order but, once set up, the status light is lit but the unit doesn't heat. Customer service rep ""Jacob"" at Cuisinart advises no troubleshooting is possible and recommends return to Amazon. However, my own experimentation prior to my call demonstrated that a poorly inserted grill plate could fail to disable the safety interlock and that the status light is lit even when the interlock is enabled. So a poorly inserted plate COULD explain the observed problem. Of course, I had satisfied myself that this was NOT the problem in my case before placing the call.Cuisinart manufacturing rates one star for poor quality assurance. This, of course, could be a statistical fluke. I may be the unlucky customer in 10,000 for all I know. But, with high confidence, Cuisinart customer support rates one star for a don't-bother-us approach to troubleshooting and for failure to offer the reasonably required apology for the ruined meal that would have been cooked on the grill.In retrospect, I find that Google discloses a fair number of reviews citing the same, or a similar, malfunction. One has to wonder whether the apparent quality problem extends only to initial use or to product life. I'm not sure I want to find out.

The bad reviews are WRONG.  This panini press heats up promptly, has NO  trouble maintaining temperature, is EASY to operate, and clean-up is a breeze!  I'm very pleased with it.

  LOVE this unit. Shopped for many others, owned a few George Forman's. This is easy to clean, easy to use, and consistently cooks well on a counter surface. The two different surfaces that come with it are great for different foods. We make everything from Paninis, Grilled sandwiches, pancakes, fajitas, quesadillas, toasted burritos, pizza, french toast, etc. We absolutely love it. It's our second unit. We used the other one SO much that it started to look and act like a piece of heavily used restaraunt gear. It was just time to replace it. Nothing was particularly wrong...it had just been over used by high school and college students ( friends of the kids at night and on weekends ) as well as a busy family. Would recommend to anyone -

  I can't say enough about this electric grill. There are three of us , cooks plenty of food for us. If you have a bigger family, I would get the bigger size. This grill/griddle cooks evenly and fast once heated properly. Food taste very good. We cook marinated filet mignon, Chicken, pork chops and grilled veggies . Everything comes out great!Easy clean up. Plates pop right out and drip tray catches the mess for easy clean up. I absolutely recommended this grill.

",1.0,Kit,"Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2011","









  
  
    
  I wanted this product for all purposes that it claimed (grill, panini press, and griddle.) The product did not even heat up proper temperature when I tried to use it for making my pancakes, which was my first use. The first batch cooked okay, but the temperature did not maintain desirable temperature. It went up and down. I could tell by the look of pancakes some area cook much faster than the other area of the surfaces. At this point, I was still hopeful that it could work for me, as long as it heats up. However, when I poured out my pancake batter for the second batch, it did not heat up for nothing! So I turned up to the highest temperature and waited for about 10 minutes and the pancakes were starting to dry out rather than cooking (like bubbles start show on the top). I wanted to know how warm the surface of the griddle; I decided to touch it with my finger. It was merely warm I could touch it without burning my finger! Needless to say that I returned the item the very next day. I think products of Cuisinart are not quality anymore. I had a similar experience with their bread machine, which was a junk just like this one. They make beautiful design but that is all, they were just expensive without quality. (Actually, both products from Cuisinart that I bought did not even function for me) I can honestly say that I will never purchase another Cuisinart product! I do not recommend this for anybody.

  I was pleased with the size of the unit which is big enough for aobut 4 hamburgers or grilled cheese sandwiches and yet small enough to keep on the counter full time.  Food cooks quickly enough that I can still get dinner for my family of 6 on without it getting cold doing it in two stages.So far I have prepared:  grilled pineapple (better than on outdoor grill - juicy);  grilled (pressed) mushrooms, onions and red peppers - (much easier than outdoors and healthier than stovetop frying);  quesidillas - same time & taste but more consistent results than frying pan  panini - nice - can't compare to a frying pan or any other technique as there really isn't one for paninis;  grilled (pressed) boneless chicken - very fast, quick way to cook compared to frying pan or oven.  stayed moist.  need to use more sauce or flavoring to keep from getting bland with the fat running off.  belgian waffles- with accessory - much quicker than my regular waffle iron and fabulousOnly downside is planning my menu.  I get to the point where I want to do everything with it for a meal but can't do to the cooldown and cleanup factor.  For example, I was planning a meal with grilled pineapple, salmon, rice and sauteed veggies.  I would have been able and interested in making everything but the rice on it but iddn't want my pineapple to taste like salmon or my salmon to have the pineapple goo all over it.  Ended up doing the salmon in the oven, the mushrooms on the grill press, then carefully wiping down with paper towel and doing the pineapple on the grill.

  We've had this for two years and love it. It is very versatile and operates as described. It has a plate on the bottom and one on the top. One side of the plates is smooth and the other is scored. The scored side is great for cooking meat that tends to dry out during cooking. Smooth side is  fantastic for grilled sandwiches. Super easy to clean. The non-stick plates just snap in and out and will fit in the sink. When cooking steak or hamburger it emits a little smoke for the first few minutes. We solved that by sitting it on the stove and turning on the exhaust fan. Particularly good for family of two.

  I have a restaurant and have used 6 different brands of Panini grills in the last twelve years. This little Cuisinart unit stands up to the very expensive commercial brands, especially for the price. None of the other consumer brands of Panini grills got hot enough to do the job efficiently, especially Breville and George Foreman brand. I bought this unit as a backup in case the first one wears out. We use it 8 hours a day seven days a week and it's been going strong for more than two years. I do not use the unit as an open grill, we use it closed, to grill sandwiches and to toast bread and bagels.04/2016 update: I recently tried the Hamilton Beach $25 panini grill out of curiosity and was very disappointed because it takes 4 times longer to heat up a sandwich, about 5 minutes which is way too long for my needs. If you're serving more than two people you will not like waiting so long. I use panini grills for my restaurant and so far nothing compares with the value of the Cuisinart Griddler. I've had $600 commercial grills that did not perform better than this unit. We still use them 8 hours a day, seven days a week and I usually get about 18 to 24 months usage from this product.

  I absolutely *love* this machine! I've cooked so many things with this, I use it almost every day. I love it for breakfast items because the lip on the plate is short so it's easy to get a spatula in to flip pancakes or French Toast, and I love the grill plates for cooking chicken. I make my own bread and use this machine to make the BEST panini sandwiches; they come out perfectly pressed, deliciously crisp, and with perfectly melted cheese. I love that the plates are reversible so there's less to store and them being dishwasher safe is a huge plus, especially in the mornings when time is short. I purchased the waffle plates and those are amazing as well, definitely recommend them as an additional purchase. The top of the unit does get very hot while you're cooking so use caution, especially if you're cooking with little ones around. I usually place a pot holder on the top of it so if I don't accidentally burn myself. One of the best purchases I've made in a while!

",4.0,Steve A,"Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2013","









  
  
    
  I have been using the griddler since I got it many months ago, about 11 months ago.  It works great but we have these strange white spots show up on the flat side.  We baby those griddle plates when cleaning them.  Hand washed then only for the first couple months, but those white spots appear.  I now put them in the dishwasher and I get less white spots, weird.  The strangest thing if you soak the plates in hot water and soap, after awhile when you pull them out of the water those white spots appear even more with a vengeance.  I noticed that under those white spots the surface is not smooth anymore.  I bet it is the hardness/acidity in the water causing the issues.  I just sent an email to Cuisinart to see what they think.  I still love to use it but would like to know what those white spots are.  The food doesn't stick and I use the other side the most anyway.The white spots are due to the hardness of my water.  Cuisinart replaced the griddle plates. Since my water is so hard I do not let them soak in water, just wash and dry them right away.  I have had the replaced griddle plates for a couple months and no spots.I would definite recommend this product.

  I am very satisfied with the purchase of this Cuisinart product. I think I actually dreamt about the interchangeable plates! Not sure what I dreamt out those. I do fear dropping them and having them break! so.. could be that's what prompted the nighttime thoughts! I got a good price at Amazon. Like 30. less than the local factory outlet store that had one. So I did get to see what I was buying before I made the purchase. I had it shipped free and ground and it seemed like Fed Ex really took their time getting it here. Amazon predicted it would arrive before Fed Ex did and the post office delivered it the day before Fed Ex predicted it would arrive. It finally arrived and in great shape.. not a dent in any boxes it was properly packaged in and it now proudly sits in the countertop and IS in use every day, sometimes several times per day. I'm loving the food that I'm grilling with it.. and my pancakes came out beautifully on the griddle as well.. burgers are a bit slow to cook on medium so you don't make the counter messy but after being cooked you can shut the lid and put some nice grill marks on the top. Our first meal cooked on it were thin boneless pork chops and they came out excellent. I'm really happy with this grill. I have a George Foreman grill.. Large, Super Large Outdoor Electric Grill, and a small size Foreman grill and there isn't much comparison.. hands down this does what I expected and I would buy it again. Grilled onions and grilled mushrooms and asparagus are amazing! Yum!

  Wow, I love this griddle. It's compact, and so far I've made burgers, french toast, panini sandwiches, and waffles - it's great for everything! It heats up very quickly. Other reviews mentioned that it doesn't get hot enough, but I definitely did not experience this issue. It heated up in a matter of minutes and the burgers baked fine. The grease wasn't a huge issue. I grilled 10 burgers, and by the end the grease tray had filled up and splashed onto the counter a bit - but I thought that was very reasonable for grilling 10 burgers in a row. It's easily detachable and cleaned, and I didn't have a problem with the grease draining. The Griddler is also very easy to clean! After it cools down, the plates are easily popped out and washed or put in the dishwasher. Overall a fantastic appliance that's easy to take care of and very versatile! I'm a college student and I definitely recommend this to others who want a variety of food but don't have a ton of space.

  I just bought this from Amazon and tonight I grilled Elk burgers in it.  They turned out great.  The plates are easy to take out and replace.  (One side of each plate is a flat surface and the other is a grill surface.) It heated up quickly.  The cleaning up part was the best.  When the plates were somewhat cooled, I put a damp paper towel in between them. Once the unit was fully cooled (I waited 30 minutes), I wiped the surfaces and then removed the plates and put them in soapy water.  Using a dish cloth, I was easily able to remove anything still on them.  I like this so much better than the George Foreman grill that I had, which did not have removable plates.  The Cuisinart is also pretty on my counter top.  I have absolutely no buyer's remorse.  I bought the unit for about $89 on Amazon.  It appears so far to be well worth it.  It also comes with a 3-year limited warranty, and I easily registered the until on the Cuisinart website.  (But you don't have to register it, it says, to have the warranty.)  So far, so good!  Tomorrow I'm making more Elk burgers!  (One thing I learned is that I don't have even countertops.  I have tiled countertops, and so all four pedals of the unit did not rest evenly on the counter.  So the grease did not go into the grease catcher properly.  This is not the unit's fault.  I moved it around until I found an even surface and tomorrow I'll try it like that.  If it doesn't drain grease well I'll edit my remarks.)

  One item I had decided was a ""must have"" for the new kitchen, when the time came to replace my old countertop appliances was this grill/griddle combo... If only it had lived up to my expectations! I purchased it in January, and just used it for the first time 2 weeks ago,and again this week, both times as a grill. As far as cooking performance is concerned I am pleased. The cooking plates, and ease of cleanliness however are another story. The items I cooked were very low in fat, and in fact the removable drip pan has never even seen a drop of fat/grease, but you would not know it from the appearance of the grill plates. No matter how often I wash them, how hot the water, or how much Dawn dish detergent I use, they appear clean until they dry, and then they are covered with what appears to be dots of solidified whitish fat. Also, straight out of the box, the griddle plates had a random ""snagged"" feeling to the surface of both plates... Kind of like the old teflon coated pans would get if you used the wrong utensils. I suspect this is a second quality appliance being sold as first quality. Very disappointed, and certainly not worth the money I paid for itUPDATE: I did contact Amazon about the issues I mentioned in this review, and they replaced the appliance and the second one I received did not have the ""snagged"" texture on the griddle/grill plates.Unfortunately, It does still require multiple washings to remove the hazy grease marks on the cook plates.

Also this griddle will fully open without the handle hitting my upper cabinet. No more turning sideways or pulling to very edge. The cooking surface seems to be evenly distributed, no hot spot found. The only thing I would change is the drip tray. It works great but you cannot see if it is getting to full without pulling it out. Small learning curve to judge when it is full!

  I simply love this product. I've been using a George Foreman grill for a couple of years. It's an okay product except when it comes to cleaning it. THAT'S where the Griddler really beats it, hands down. With the Griddler, you simply press the two side ""buttons,"" located on either side, and the plates pop out for easy cleaning either in the dishwasher or by hand.Plus, you can flip the Griddler's plates making it easy to prepare eggs, pancakes, etc. You can also use a grill plate and a griddle plate simultaneously, enabling you to prepare eggs, bacon, and pancakes at the same time: The unit easily opens flat.Using both griddle plates, you can prepare grilled sandwiches, thanks to the hinged top. Bring on the panini sandwiches!The Griddler heats quickly and evenly and the knobs light up when the temperature you've set is reached. You can even SEAR your meats with this appliance.The grease catcher is large and nicely located in the side of the appliance, but is easily removed for cleaning.And if that's not enough, you can also buy Belgian waffle plates for this appliance!BOTTOM LINE: You can't possibly miss with this appliance.

When it is open all the way to grill on the top lid is suppose to stay flat. Mine does not. It's only a slight angle so it's not a big deal, but if it did stay flat and the top grill got as hot as the bottom that would be a great improvement.

  I got this hoping it would be good for cooking pancakes and burgers. While I loved it at first, the first time I tried to cook burgers on it, that love started to fade. I set it on sear, waiting for it to heat up (many minutes), put the burgers on, and the sizzling sound you would think would happen, was not there. I ended up stop using the grill settings and just did the griddle setting.While there was a work around for heating, the pan was never as hot as I would have liked. Pancakes took longer then they should have while still on the same temp I have cooked them on another electric griddle. And since there was no latch to keep the press closed, moving it off and on the counter to save space was a clumsy chore.A year later, one of the feet in the back have broken off because it isn't metal. The clasps that hold the plates on are not working withe buttons, and I now have to pull them open or push them close. It is still usable, but with all the fighting I have had with this item, it is going in the trash. I am really surprised at how much this item falls short of the normal quality of Cuisinart, and I was so excited to have it. But now, I will will just start using my cast iron stovetop grill/griddle combo, which is still a chore to move around, but at least I know it falling apart is not going to happen, and I know it will get hot.

The plates are easy to get in and out, and the non-stick finish has stayed brand-new looking after weeks and weeks of heavy use. The temperature gets hot enough to truly sear a steak (we used to joke that the S.I. grill ""boiled"" the steak). In fact, the Cuisinart has a ""Sear"" setting on the dial. It's also quite compact, which fits nicely onto my counter as I lack storage space. Highly recommend this product!5 MONTHS LATER...This is hands-down the best grill I've ever owned or even seen at someone else's house! The non-stick surface is fantastic! I use it at least 3x a week, sometimes 5 or 6 times, and there is not a single scratch or a single bit of residue on the grill surfaces. They look as new as the day I got them. Also, the grill plates are so much lighter than my previous grill, and the reversible feature (plus top/bottom interchangeable) makes them just perfect. On the grill settings, the SEAR function is awesome, use it all the time and it still heats like it did on Day 1. Filets get seared on the outside (with real grill marks) and are still warmish-red in the center. I have no affiliation with Cuisinart, but seriously if they want an enthusiastic testimonial, they need to call me! I love this thing.

  First time we used it resulted in great paninis. And they get better every time as we get practice with timing and heat settings. Have not used it as a flat griddle yet, but can see where  it would work great in that application. Our previous panini press did NOT have detachable plates, which made cleaning a long and tough chore. Took the fun out of the paninis, and we found we used it less frequently. These detachable plates are non-stick which makes cleaning much easier and faster. Can only fit 2 paninis on the griddle at one time so may not be practical for large families. But we love it!

  In my tight space I wanted something versatile and upon reading many reviews online I purchased this griddler.  Cleaning is easy enough, cooking plates have a weight to them.  I find I don’t get the “grill” marks on the pork or chicken though and I have to cook them more to get done.  Lots of moisture released as they cook and not brown.  Pancakes cook well.  Am I totally happy with purchase?  half and half.

  4.5 stars  I've had two of these. The first survived about 10 meals before one of the heating elements went out. However, after using it for paninis, quesadillas, grilled cheese, waffles, eggs, pancakes, and every type of meat there is, we bought another while waiting for Cuisinart to honor the warranty. (We had to pay for shipping.) This past Christmas, we bought one for every household in the family. George Foreman, who??  (Side note: don't try to do scrambled eggs and make sure the griddle is hot before you do crack a ""fried"" egg on it. Otherwise, the liquid will just run to the drain. The flat griddle is slow to heat and takes longer to get your pancakes ""golden"". Waffles take about 4 minutes. )

  We've had our Griddler now for a while and it's seen a lot of use.  We've used it mostly for paninni sandwiches and it works great for that.  We've used it flat for pancakes and a few other things and it worked just as well for those.  If your paninni's are real thick the 2 grilling surfaces might not be line up parallel to each other, but I wouldn't take away from it's rating for that.  You just need to know it's limitations.  The non stick surface on the flat side and grill side of the plates is exceptional.  Cleans up super easy with just water.  For flat grilling duty, some folks might be better suited to a full size griddle as this one limits you somewhat with 2 smaller griddles instead of a single larger one.  Would I buy another one?  In a heartbeat, but hopefully this one holds up for many years and I won't need to.I have to add a little to my initial review.  We've had our griddler since January, so right at the 6 month mark.  It has died and does not function any longer.  Six months it lasted!?  Really!!  I won't buy another one!

    Broke in only 38 days of using it.  Warranty is worthless
  
",1.0,Steve Y,"Reviewed in the United States December 19, 2012","









  
  
    
  I purchased this unit from Amazon and received it on 10/23/12.  On 12/1/12 one of the plastic tabs that hold the top grill plate on the unit broke and would not hold the top plate to the unit anymore. We were only using the unit once or twice a week and were not hard on it.  When you took out the screws and opened the unit up there is a pin that levers the plastic arm to release the plates for cleaning and the plastic broke from around this pin and there is no way to fix it.  Amazon would only let you return the unit to them until 11/23/12.  So I had to contact the manufacturer about the product which is Cuisinart/Conair Corp since the unit has a 1 year warranty on it.  I contacted them and first of all they are not responsive and took a few  days to respond each time I contacted them.  They will send you out a new unit but they want you to pay for the shipping of the defective unit back and the $10 they spent shipping the new unit to you.  Their warranty doesn't cover shipping costs even when their product is defective and you can't find the warranty info before hand to know this.  I got them to waive the $10 fee shipping the new unit to me but they are still making me pay the shipping back which is $10!  I really had no choice since I would be out $90 to go get another unit.  Also they obviously know they are selling defective parts on the market!  The new one I just received has the plastic tab that broke and hold the plates replaced with metal ones!  Also they changed the grilling plates in my new unit too to drain better!  If this company was a respectable company they would have pulled off all these defective units off of the market or at least take care of a customer when selling defective units. Its obvious they are at fault and should not charge for shipping either way and provided a prepaid return shipping label in the box with the new unit!

  I have two George Foreman grills that I like, but they aren't easy to clean.  I've been looking at stand-alone griddles, or griddle pans to supplement my limited cooking surfaces (I have a 24"" stove/oven).  I looked at the video review for the Griddler and was pretty intrigued.  Grilling, panini-ing and flat surfaces, this seemed pretty versatile and easy to use.  Plus, much easier to clean than my Foreman grills since the plates are dishwasher-safe.I didn't even read the enclosed directions for the Griddler, its form and function are very intuitive.  I used it for the first time today to make a grilled cheese sandwich.  Yes, I'm so lazy I didn't want to make it on the stove and have to flip the sandwich over.  It was outstanding -- pepper jack cheese, bacon and jalapeno slices -- and the clean-up was simple.  The cheese had bubbled out of the sandwich onto the plates and it wiped up easily.  I probably won't put the plates in the dishwasher, but the fact that they're removable will make them easier to clean than my Foreman grill.  I can wash them in the sink and they dry quickly and easily.I have some slider hamburger patties that I will also try on the Griddler but based on this afternoon's results I expect to be quite pleased with the outcome.  Given the versatility and functionality of the Griddler, I suspect my Foreman grills will find their way to Goodwill very soon.

  This product works great, but it is very unsafe. The power cords, is located behind the grill on the left.

  Some things are better left simple, and this is the prime example.  This griddler couldn't be easier to use.  The design is pretty much flawless.  The griddle/grill plates can be removed super easily and they are non-stick so they clean right up.  The heat adjustment is quick to master and the grills heat up very fast.  We were making paninis in no time when I removed this from the box.  Now I'm hooked on using it.  The only complaint that I have is that the top of the grill should be easier to unlock so it ""floats"".  There's a peg that holds it in place and there should be a way to press a button to release it.  You have to push the griddle top to keep it flat when closing on a sandwich and that's not easy when the grill is super-hot.  Overall I can't not recommend this. I'd buy this again in a second - it probably costs less than 1-2 nights out at a restaurant.  It's also nice and small and easy to store.

  I've had the Griddler for about six months now, and I use it regularly. I mainly had wanted a panini press, but figured the other functions could come in handy. I have a gas stove, and well, let's just say about now when it gets to be 90, I really don't want to use it. I also live in an apartment, so all I really have is communal access to a grill, and I'm not particularly ever in the mood to go down to it and cook for myself.For paninis, this is absolutely marvelous. Here's a hint though to make cleanup very easy: wrap your sandwich in parchment paper before putting it on the press. Within 5-7 minutes, you have a toasted sandwich, and you don't have to clean up melted cheese from the plates. I typically don't use the grill sides of the plates for sandwiches, but when I have with this method it hasn't been a problem...still get the lines even though they add nothing for me.I've found also it is very useful for cooking up a steak. Even a $3 steak tastes amazing after a couple minutes on the griddler. It creates far less smoke than my normal cast iron pan method, which is a serious bonus. Chicken breasts cook in an insanely short amount of time if you use the closed grill method. And it is actually like they have been grilled.The time it takes to heat up has never been a problem. I start heating it up before I get to work prepping, so while I'm still in the midst of sandwich building, the griddler will be heated. Definitely might be a good idea to give it a bit of extra time. I've never had a problem where the food seemed more like it had been steamed.Only dislikes really are the size...as in, there is no way I can really lay this open to cook on both sides of it. I'm also just one person, so I'm not cooking for a family. It just doesn't seem stable on that upper griddle either if I can find a way to spread it out across a countertop. After trying to cook green pepper slices on it once, I gave up on it altogether since they would just slide towards the end. But for one plate or in a closed position, which makes up 99% of my use anyway, it's perfect for me.

    Grill does not efficiently drain grease.
  
",2.0,M. Newton,"Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2014","









  
  
    
  After reading lots of reviews and comparing this grill to others in this genre I made the decision to purchase this product.  As usual Amazon was prompt and efficient with delivery.  The grill seems to be well built and I do like the reversible and removable grill surfaces for variety and easy clean up.  The controls are a bit ambiguous but can be figured out with usage.  The reason for the two stars is what I consider to be a serious flaw.  The grill has a very small slit in the back for the drainage of fluids and grease from the grill. The Grill is level or even slightly sloped to the front.  This results in the pooling of grease in the grill; tilting the grill back helps but the slit is so small that it easily flows over onto the counter surface behind the grill.  A big reason for using this type of grill is to lessen the amount of grease that remains on the food.  If this is a prime consideration for you do not buy this grill.  Otherwise it is a decent product.

  We love grilled sandwiches and up until we bought this unit, we toasted them in the toaster, then nuked them in the microwave.  That works but not always a great look afterwards.  I buy very few appliances since I generally find they collect dust after a very short time.  This unit isn't finding its way off the countertop any time soon. Everyone from our teenagers to us adults love making paninis with this.  It is so easy to use, just turn a button, set the heat level and wait for the light to go green and you are set. The result is lovely heated/melted inside of sandwiches and nice crisp exterior - so nice with soup, for after school snack or a weekend lunch. The non-stick plates are super easy to clean and dishwasher safe.  My teens have found this unit is great for heating and toasting burritos and other snacks.We might eventually buy the waffle plates since we love waffles but right now, we are just thrilled with the sandwich feature.  To each his own!!We bought this on sale and have no complaints at all, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it for the features, the even heating, the ease of usage and cleaning and its nice compact size which prevents it from being a counter top space hog.

This thing is so great that since I bought one for us three years ago, I have bought two more to give as gifts and this is now my go-to housewarming gift.We use it for:-bacon (closing the griddler on the bacon makes sure it cooks flat instead of curling up)-hamburgers-quesadillas-steaks-bratwurst-breakfast potatoes (when opened like a griddle)-pancakes-waffles (with the waffle plates, which are sold separately)-etc.It is on our counter all the time and gets used 2-5 times per week.

  Had a few older Foreman grills and loved them but it was time for a new grill due to the Foreman grills just being old and finally wearing out after years of reliable service. I was looking for specific features, size and styling since it sits on a counter top all the time. It was the customer reviews on Amazon and a few professional sites that I trust that made me give this grill a try.It has now been a few months and while that is not long enough to say anything about reliability and longevity I can certainly say this thing is fantastic. I love the versatility. It seems to heat up very fast which saves everyone time. Very easy to clean due to the what I think is innovative drip system. The only thing I don't like about it and this is nitpicking...The handle acts as a leg when fully open which is great but I think when its closed it needs one more layer of folding so it doesn't stick up so much.I would recommend this grill to anyone, at least try it out.

Just take the plates out and put them in the dishwasher. Problem solved.Tool -Junk. Only down side to the grill. It comes with a little plastic spatula/scraper that lasted three days before my roommate melted it by trying to clean the plates off when it was a tad to hot. This could be user error (I'm sure), but it's not a big loss.Wear-ability -I do think it's to early to tell on this one, but so far so good. There hasn't been any loss of the surface(non stick coating) or scratches. I have three roommates, that's a big deal. I have read that some people had problems with the plastic clips melting, but that hasn't happened to me. They are in great shape so far.Overall, really happy. All my roommates want one.

  I have to say I have wanted this little baby from the moment I viewed the commercial.  I have a Foreman grill and I liked it but I wanted something that could do more than just grill and did not take up a lot of counter space.  Enter the Griddler.  I have to say the price at Amazon was cheaper then anywhere I found it in PA and that was counting the Black Friday deals.  Back to the grill.  I have cooked breakfast on it for the past week, the time it has saved me in the am is worth the cost. I would advise it heats faster if you leave it closed then open it flat when the go light comes on  Clean up is a simple matter of placing a damp paper towel between the plates as it cools down lifting the lid wiping the plates and your done (someone here recommended that tip thank you).  I grilled steaks last night with onions and mushrooms perfection. Grilled sandwiches are a no brainier and now I don't have to try and figure out where I put my press! I leave it right on my counter top. Personally I like simple compact and professional this baby has it all.

I use it for panninis, grilled cheese and quesadillas in the closed position, and I make perfect over easy eggs, french toast, and pancakes in the open position.  I sprang for the waffle plates, and it makes great waffles too!  Definitely the best kitchen purchase I've made in years, and since the plates are non-stick and removable, it's easy to keep clean.Word of caution: don't use cooking spray or ""good for your heart"" margarine on the non-stick plates.  Only real butter or real oil, and always hand-wash, and your plates will last a long time.

  This product looks good - the grille plates do not drain the fat off the meat at all - I used it for hamburgers and the grease went every where - The George Forman is a much better designed product - with the fat draining issue it can’t be used outside - and it doesn’t get hot enough for grilling - disappointing. - would not recommend it at all

  I was looking for a reliable replacement for my Foreman contact grill that I always felt I had to go 10 rounds with in the ring to clean.  I was skeptical, but hopeful, when I saw the Cuisinart ""GR-4 Griddler"", and decided, despite the cost, to give it a try after reading some of the reviews.  I wanted removable grill plates, first and foremost, for ease of cleaning.  And ease of cleaning I got.  Dishwasher safe, but easy enough to clean right in the sink with a nylon bristle brush and detergent.  What a dream!Also, the hinged grill design is so inventive.  At first, it seemed like it would be hard to deal with, but it works so well because it  allows such versatility!  I've grilled vegetables like frozen hashbrowns and green beans in it and I've grilled thick Italian sausages and steaks in it. It can go from fat to thin and vice versa because of that unique hinge.I have just about every kitchen appliance imaginable.  Some I love, but use infrequently. Some I never use.  THIS ONE, I use ALL the time.  My husband can actually cook for himself and I don't dread the clean-up as I did with my previous grill.I can't imagine being disappointed with the purchase of this grill.

  It works as advertised and is VERY easy clean up - just a wet paper towel immediately after cooking and then drying is all I've needed.  Have cooked paninis, hamburgers and finished cooking steak and veggies for fajitas.  The leftover steak for fajitas I had cooked to rare on a stovetop grill pan the day before and, let me tell you, that was a BEAR to clean off the grill pan.  But, when I finished cooking the leftovers to eat the next day, I put them on this Cuisinart griddler instead, and the clean-up was immediate and super easy.  HUGE difference from scrubbing for a very long time and with lots of elbow grease to just wiping off.  And, just in case anyone cares, the fajita steak mojo (marinade) I used was from Tyler Florence's fajitas recipe on FoodNetwork.com and it made the BEST steak (tri-tip) EVER.  Highly recommend that recipe for the marinade and can't wait to use it again.

  This griddler is simply amazing! It's extremely easy to use and clean afterwards. I've been using it every day since I got it 2 weeks ago.Both plates are removable (and reversible.) I clean them in my sink, by hand and have no problems.The drip tray also comes in handy. But one of the best qualities of this Cuisinart product is that there is almost no smoke coming out.So far I have used it as:1. A panini maker - it makes great sandwiches - crispy on the outside, but soft on the inside. The cheese melts nicely and doesn't burn.2. Grill - I made some chicken kebabs last week and they turned out great. The kebabs grilled evenly and didn't burn. They had the nice smokey flavor that many people like.3. I also grilled steaks. I was able to get some medium-rare AND some medium-well - as people in my family like them different ways.4. To grill burgers and Bulgarian meatballs. Again - the food turned out to be delicious.Everyone around here loves this product and I strongly recommend that you buy it too!

  I find this works very well for everything you can imagine.  Cleanup is a snap.  Just so people know...if you need to grill more than one session, you are going to get smoke build up in your kitchen if like me and others you have a vent that vents into the kitchen.  With a just a couple steaks it is no problem at all and I imagine it is the same for one session of burgers.  But I tried two sessions once and it was a bit smoky.  And contrary to one person said with regard to cook times, it does not go faster the second session.  I found steaks if they are not thin take anywhere between 5-7 minutes depending on thickness.  And you will want to keep any marinade to a minimum to avoid the smoke.  Paninis are a snap.  Trays snap in and out easily...not much more to say and it has all been said before anyway really.

  This is a great multi-purpose grill. Panni's, vegetables, pancakes, steaks and other meats cook up great on it. Cleanup is quick with the removable plates, and a quick wipe down of the rest of the unit should take care of any splatters. The biggest ""problem"" I have is cooking steaks and other meats, as they cook very quickly on this grill. Less than a minute can be the difference between rare and way over done.

  After reading the reviews here on Amazon, we ordered Cuisinart's 5-in-1 Griddler.  We made it a 6-in-1 by ordering the Belgium Waffle plates. This appliance seems to be well made and it is the perfect size for two people. We are fulltime RVers and we like the fact that it doesn't take up much space. It does an excellent and quick job of grilling meats, veggies and fruits. I've already pressed several sandwiches, from Cubans to grilled cheese and it preformed beautifully. The griddle makes really good breakfasts too.  I use silicone egg rings to make the perfect eggs.  I've tried my hand at Belgium Pecan Waffles and they were delicious though I did cook them a few minutes longer then directed and they were perfect. It was a little slow at cooking pancakes at the recommended 400 degrees.  Next time I will adjust it higher which should do the trick.  The clean up is easy as well.  After cooking, I turn it off and place wet paper towels in between the grates and after a few minutes, it wipes clean.  It allows us to cook healthy but quick foods and is a great addition to our kitchen. I highly recommend this product.

  I got this grill/griddle after visiting my parents over the holidays and having a couple dinners made by mom on hers.Why I love it:- It's a very sturdy unit, and doesn't feel wobbly or junky like some of the cheaper versions made of plastic.  It's a nice, heavy grill and the grill and griddle plates are also very sturdy.- I LOVE that the plates pop out and can go right into the dishwasher or, if you're feeling handy, easily clean up in the sink.- It's two appliances in one - a panini press/grill and griddle - which saves space.. an important attribute for a kitchen gadget addict with limited storage space- The floating hinge ensures that when you 'close' the grill, it's still getting full coverage on the top and bottom of whatever it is you're cooking, and saves you from having to flip it- Convenience of a grill without having a big barbeque, and healthier/less messy than grilling with a charcoal BBQThere are many other versions of this type of appliance out there, but none matched the quality or the versatility of the Cuisinart in this price range.  Definitely more expensive than the typical Foreman-type grill, but the versatility and quality warrant the additional expense.

  This grill is one of the premier counter top grill/griddles on the market.  My father in law had one and now I have one and gave one as a gift to a friend.Pros:Clean up is simple!  The grill plates can be removed which makes clean up extremely simple. The grill plates can also be flipped over and turned into a griddle for pancakes or eggs or whatever you want to put on it.  The lid is situated on a pivot hinge which allows the lid to sit flat on whatever meat you put on it, thus giving you an even grill.  Unlike some others that have a flat lid which cooks unevenly. The unit is small enough that it fits easily in any pantry.Cons:NoneGreat product that will allow you to easily grill from your counter top in the winter or any time really.

    Good Unit w/ One Serious Flaw for Burgers
  
",3.0,,"Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2006","









  
  
    
  I've been using this item at least once a week for about six months now.  I use it primarily as a griddle for french toast or pancakes or as a grill for hamburgers.  As a griddle, it works fine.  I wish it were a little bigger, but with creative arrangement it will hold 6 pieces of french toast.  As a grill, it leaves a lot to be desired.  It has a drip tray, but the unit is not angled properly for the grease to drain.  I use 96% fat free ground beef, which is pretty dry, but the grease -still- runs out of the back of the unit.  I'd taken to propping it up, which helped but didn't solve the problem. Last night, I propped it on two inverted bowls--so much of an angle that the grease was running down over the controls in the front, and it -still- ran out the back of the unit. It isn't that I've overloaded the grill--we're only talking 4 hamburgers.  But that's done it for me.  I'm going to take a good look at the George Foreman GRP90WGR.  It also has removable plates, and maybe it's better designed.If you're looking for a griddle or a panini press, the cuisinart could be great.  But if you make hamburgers as often as I do, you  might want to look somewhere else.

  Needed to replace a countertop grill I've used for years and years.  Wanted another one with removable plates.  Was hesitant to order after reading some of the reviews, but am so glad I purchased this.When it comes to my nature, I have to say I'm slightly on the critical end of the spectrum.  As someone at work once said, ""We know you don't give praise lightly.""With that understanding in place, I really do love this grill.  So far I've used it in the grill position to make steaks and burgers, and in the griddle position to make eggs easy over.  In the grill position, can easily cook 3-4 good sized burgers - where my last grill only made two.  The design of the drip tray openings has a lot to do with the increased surface area available.  Very thoughtful design in that regard.In the griddle position, was able to easily make 4 eggs at once with plenty of room to spare.  Six eggs at once (three on each side) would be no problem at all, and eight at once would be possible.  The slight slope of the ""bottom"" side of the griddle meant the egg white tended to run a little toward the back edge, so I was careful to ""drop"" the eggs slowly and allow the whites to harden as I was tipping egg out of the shell.  Some little rings to keep eggs contained and nice and round may be a purchase I'll make, but not a necessity in order to use the griddle for eggs.Love that the temperature knobs have green indicator lights to signal when the selected temperature has been reached.  I don't find the controls confusing, as a few have.  Select ""grill"" to use nominal settings (warm, low, medium, high, sear) or griddle to use temperature settings (in degrees fahrenheit).  Either setting can be used in closed or open position.Love the handle so we don't get blasted with steam when opening the lid.  The plates are lighter than the plates on my old grill - which I think is a good thing.  They are still plenty sturdy to do the job, but not a lot of extra weight.  In spite of the extra cooking area, this grill fits in the same space where I stored my previous grill.  Love that the plates reverse, so I don't have to have a place to store the ""other"" set of plates.Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.  It is a big improvement on my past two counter-top grills.

    The Swiss Army Knife of Panini Makers.
  
",5.0,Sam Donaldson,"Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2013","









  
  
    
  I've loved paninis for the longest time, but didn't know I could make them at home until I saw this model in a store.  I knew I had to get it, or something like it, so I did the research and I became a huge fan of this contraption.The GR4N is like the Swiss Army knife of panini makers/griddles.  It really seems like the design team that produced this incorporated a number of different ideas and functions to produce a truly versatile unit.  And for the price (especially the Amazon price), it's a fantastic value.  I believe it's the best of its class currently available. The only way you could do better, in my opinion, is by buying a vastly more expensive, professional model used in restaurants.I don't own a toaster; so this even toasts my bread in a pinch.PROS:* Amazing, painless clean up.  With its nonstick surface, sometimes all you need to do is wipe it perfectly clean with a damp paper towel.  The detachable griddles are fantastic.* Ability to switch between flat surface and ribbed surface is great.* The ability to open it up flat, doubling your grill space, is very useful.* Temperature control allows you to fine tune your grill.* The floating cover allows you to pretty much panini anything, from very thick to very thin.* It's a light, compact, sturdy unit that stores very easily.CONS:* The weight of the top grill often isn't sufficient to immediately crush the sandwich like they do with the professional $500 models.  (This isn't insurmountable however; simply, manually press and wait a few minutes for the heat to take effect.)* Sometimes the heat applied is not completely uniform over the width of the griddle.* It is a compact unit.  This is for sandwiches, not for grilling large T-bone steaks.  (Its compactness is also a Pro, above.)* I think the power cord leaving the unit should have been shielded: on a crowded kitchentop countertop, one has to sometimes look for the cord before opening the unit.* And I do have a design quibble.  There are currently 3 knobs on the Griddler: 1 ""Griddle"" knob with temperature notations; 1 ""Grill-Panini"" knob with notations ""Warm-Low-Med-High""; a 3-way selector knob that toggles between Off/Griddle/Grill-Panini.  All that was really needed was an On-Off switch and a single Knob with 2 bands of markings.  There's no real functional difference between selecting Griddle or selecting Grill-Panini.  Griddle at 200 degrees corresponds to Grill-Panini at ""Warm.""  Griddle at 400 degrees corresponds to Grill-Panini at ""High.""  I think this design is more of a marketing function than utility to the consumer, perhaps to sex it up and differentiate it from Cuisinart's cheaper GR-35 model.

Heats up quickly and any drippings get caught in the hidden capture tray for very easy clean-up. Only thing I didn't like was the utensil provided. I suppose it's to be used for cleaning, but I used a few times to lift and turn food and it melted a bit. I would love to see a melamine turner with the groove-filling tabs.

  First off this is the first griddler/pannini press I have ever owned and I am not any a gourmet.  I bought this griddler/pannini press for my wife because she loves eating pannini sandwiches.  We have had it only for a month and to date have not made any pannini sandwiches but have used it as an indoor grill (steaks, hamburgers, vegetables, etc.) We have been very satisfied with the product.  It heats up in a reasonable amount of time, stays hot, cooks the food very quickly and clean up is a breeze.  The non-stick plates are excellent and removable for easy clean up.  One issue in the griddle/pannini mode when you fold back the top plate to handle the food and it is covered by oil or grease it does drip off the bottom (hinge edge) on to the cord and counter.  We addressed this issue by ""molding"" paper towels across this area to collect the drippings.  The press handle stays cool during cooking and it takes ~20-30 minutes for the plates to cool down sufficiently to be handled for washing.  The appliance appears to be well built and sturdy but lightweight and compact enough for storage.  One thing I personally don't like are the unattached drip cups which of course I have already knocked over spilling grease all over the place.  But from looking at the various brands out there this seems to be a fairly common set up.  The price is even lower now so if you are in the market for one right now I feel this is a good deal.

  This was a present to myself that my kids love!I bought it so I can make paninis and grill at home at winter time. It is very simple and user friendly, have a lot of grilling space but on the other hand small enough to find a storage place for it. It come with a little cooking book that have some great recipes and ideas.You can basically cook anything on it with the multiple cooking options, grill and griddle.I would highly recommend to buy also the waffles plates as my kids absolutely love my chocolate chip waffle I make them on the weekends :)Very easy to clean, everything just come off with hot water, not need to scarab at all.All in all, simple to use and easy to clean, perfect fit for any kitchen.

  I was talked into ordering this by someone who had a similar item but the plates didn't come out and was hard to clean. We talked a few times about him ordering one and I logged into Amazon..ta da they were on sale. So I ordered one...now that I've seen it in action I would have paid full price! This thing is awesome! I have a lot of kitchen appliances that get used once then stored but not this Griddler. So far I have used it 5 times and its only been a couple of weeks.Plus side: duel control for grilling or griddle. Easy cleanup...easy to use..oh did I say easy cleanup! The food cooks evenly, no squished side because the top floats on the hinges. I put frozen hamburgers on and they were cooked to perfection in about 5 mintues. Toasted pita..oh yeah! It does it all...plus for you who like waffles you can get the waffle plates. That is the only downside, you have to purchase them seperately.

  This is a very unique appliance which is very versatile.  The top and bottom cooking ""plates"" easily remove in order to wash . Great for grilling anything  plus frying without a lot of grease or oil . When cooking meat with a lot of juice, the juices will automatically flow into a specially built- in receptacle which is easily removed for cleaning. Thumbs up on this new appliance.

    If you don't have a dishwasher, not so easy to clean
  
",3.0,O. Delio,"Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2009","









  
  
    
  -Plus-(1) I've now owned the Griddler for two weeks. I've never managed to make a chicken breast in my life which wasn't over- or under-done. With the Griddler, I was able to make six perfect chicken breasts in 5 minutes. I was really, really pleased and they tasted fabulous.-Minus-(2) I just tried London Broil today - it turned out OK. What's confusing is that if you plan on using the double-sided grill, the Griddler only specifies Warm, Low, Medium, High and Sear, so you need to guess what the equivalent stove temperature would be (i.e. 300 degrees, 400 degrees, broil, etc.). I used High for 6 minutes and - while it was well done on the outside - the inside was still bloody. So, there's some amount of tweaking you need to do initially to figure out how to cook certain items which aren't explicitly covered in the Griddler cookbook that comes with the product.-Additional Points to Consider: Grease-(3) Definitely consider putting paper towels behind the Griddler. When you're done using it, if you let it cool down with the top plate suspended above the bottom plate, the top plate will have a tendency to drip meat juice and grease onto the countertop behind it.-Additional Points to Consider: Cleaning-(4) It's really not that easy to clean UNLESS you have a dishwasher or a lot of patience. You need to allow the Griddler atleast 30 minutes to cool down before you can detach the plates without burning yourself. If you prefer meat which is seared on the outside, you probably haven't sprayed the plates with non-stick oil - in which case they're probably crusted. If you try to wash them in the sink immediately, you'll spend *a long time* trying to scrape off the crust with the tool that comes with the Griddler, and you'll get wet and smelly while doing so. Today, I let them soak in the sink for about 15 minutes before washing them - this worked out much better. However, for all the time I saved using my Griddler for cooking, I lost in waiting for it too cool down and then in waiting for it to soak.Overall, I'm still happy with the purchase, primarily because of the chicken breasts. I'm hoping to try the panini feature tomorrow. But, the thing to recognize is that it's just not as quick and easy as everyone seems to say it is (atleast not in my experience) if you don't have a dishwasher.

  This griddler definitely lives up to the hype. We have used both sides of the plates to grill/griddle and everything cooks evenly, in much less time than a regular grill. The grill Plate leaves beautiful grill marks. Meats grilled using the Griddler are juicy and tender. I would highly recommend the Griddler to anyone who wants to grill indoors.

  I use this thing all the time and I have had it for over 6 months.  No issues.  If it were stolen or broken I would buy another one THAT SAME DAY.  I love this thing!  I cook sandwiches, chicken and meats, waffles, etc...  The plates are removable and I put them in the dishwasher to clean them.  I bought the waffle plates, which are extra, and I am not disappointed at all.  Everything cooks and tastes how I expect it should.  Sandwiches (panini, grilled cheese, quesadilla, etc...)  are cooked in less than 3 minutes.  Chicken and other meats take longer to cook thoroughly of course, depending on how thickly sliced it is.  The lid will self adjust to the height of the food you place in it up to several inches up, it is on a pivoting hinge so that it will lay flat on bulky objects placed within it.  You can use this thing like a grill and lay it flat (top and bottom are both cooking surfaces) or use it like a george foreman grill (it has a drip pan to drain the fat that cooks off).  I never use metal utensils on it in fear of scratching the surface ( I don't even think it has a coating TBH), but so far I haven't had anything stick to it nor have I seen any signs of wear.  The temperature adjusts as needed and is as easy to use as a stove top, but frankly I always use it at high heat because I like my food to have some browning and crispy edges.  It is large, you can cook 4 sandwiches at one time;  I have cooked one, two, three and four sandwiches at once on this thing and it has cooked them all evenly and thoroughly no matter how i place them or arrange them on the grill. The heating is even and consistent.  Just a little (and i mean little) butter and stuff tastes awesome and does NOT stick!

  We thought it was going to be great, and that feeling was reinforced after the first use. However, the lever that releases the top for using the griddle feature snapped off the very next time. This is the one characteristic of contemporary manufacturing that has continued to spiral out of control; nothing is made to last. We go through a space heater each season, and I'm not happy about that, but when I pay 70+ dollars of my hard earned money I expect the thing to last more a single use.

  I'll echo the comments of a couple of other reviews further down... this is a great idea with poor execution. We purchased this grill primarily for use as a griddle, and we had high hopes for it. The panini/grill functions would have been a bonus for us. What we found is that it's pretty much useless as a griddle. The thermostat shuts completely off and the plates cool down so much that the food stops cooking - bacon stopped sizzling, and pancakes stayed very light. Even turning the thermostat up didn't immediately seem to turn the heating elements back on. We tried it twice over the course of a weekend, and gave up on it. Too bad, this seemed like such a great concept.

Started off doing great in terms of cooking and evenness, but cooking multiple meals means time is increased DRAMATICALLY.  This is good for a couple.  I don't recommend trying to cook more then that if you are in a time crunch.3. I bought this because removing the plates would make it easy to clean and they do.  however, it seems that this product has built in draining that only works if you are on a PERFECTLY flat surface.  I end up having to tilt to drain properly.All-in-All I would still get it again but not for the purchase price of $100.00.  Maybe more in the range of $60.00.

My wife and daughter love to cook pancakes on it too. They say the pancakes are a lot more fluffy than when cooked on our old griddle.One important thing is when pre-heating make sure it is closed. It preheats much better that way.We have enjoyed it so much, we got my mother one for her birthday.Clean up is a breeze.

  When I saw the pics & previews in the ad this thing looked soooo awesome so thought I'd grab one on on the special deal pricing that Amazon was offering. It came packed in the usual great Amazon fashion & looked as good in real life as the ad made it look. Couldn't wait to use it and the first time out, it worked perfect, a real pleasure to use. Thought it far superior to my trusty old George Foreman because of the easy to remove for cleaning grill plates, and the expanding grilling area feature. But the next time my pride in this machine was shattered when I went to turn up the temperature on it and the knob fell off into the floor. Well that was unexpected, but thought it would probably be easy enough to reinsert, but not the case. It wasn't broke, but rather some sort of press fitted arrangement, and it refused to stay in place making the temperature control totally inoperative as it was stuck in the lo heat position.When I called the Cuisinart toll free help line I was placed on hold for nearly 10 minutes and finally after reaching a rep was told that it would cast $10. for them to ship me a replacement and after I received the replacement that I would need to return the defective one to them again at my cost of course. While I like the grill, I must say that given the quality of Cuisinart's service & poor warranty, I really don't think that in all fairness I could recommend this product above the much cheaper George Foreman. I was willing to pay more because I perceived this to be a better product, but it isn't. I't just another built in China as cheaply as possible item.12/19/12 - Thought I would update this review to lety you know how this matter is progressing. I received a replacement for the original broken griddler today on UPS, postage pre-paid after some heated negotion abot why I should have to pay to ship the thing to me, and have to pay to ship the original broken one back as well. Anyway, when I pulled the replacement out of the box, parts started to fall off it as well. I immediately called Conaire which is the company who makes Cusinart and complained that the replacement unit was also broke, and they agreed to send a will-call tag for it. UPS has picked up the second one, and at this point, I think that it would probably be best if I just sent this back to Amaon, and called it quits. I own quite a number of cusinart products from skillets, to coffee pots, blenders, etc. but after dealing with this product, I'm not too confident in the brand any longer and would not be comfortable recommending it to a friend.

  This is a really nice grill. I have used it twice to cook skirt steak and flank steak. I used the ""sear"" temperature on the grill and it cooked the steak pretty fast. I used the press to cook the steak. You have to keep an eye on the food the first couple of times until you know how hot the settings are. My steak was seared nicely. Nicely browned. All the fat and juices went nicely into the drip pan...no mess either. Easy to clean and a very nice sized grill. Not as big as I thought it would be. I cooked a medium sized flank steak on here. The only problem I had was that the steak was unevenly shaped in thickness so it didnt sear the entire steak when I used the press. No big deal though. I'm really glad I bought this item because of the temperature controls. And I the grill pans are soooo easy to remove and clean. VERY EASY. I had a lot of marinade on both my steaks and it left quite a mess on the grill pans but it was really easy to clean. Very nice looking grill too!

  I am very satisfied with my purchase of the Griddler. I've cooked burgers, steaks, panini's, bacon, sausage, potatoes,& pancakes on this machine & I'm very satisfied. I bought this machine to replace my old George Foreman machine. The Griddler makes great tasting burgers & steaks. My George Foreman would ""steam"" my meats & I hated it. The Griddler heats up quickly & is very easy to clean. I let it cool down, remove the plates, & wash them by hand. I NEVER put any teflon-coated product in my dishwasher. I only use plastic utencils to remove food, etc. from my Griddler. My only complaint would be that I wish Cuisinart had designed the unit to tilt to let the grease from meats run into the spill pan quicker.The little recipe book that comes w/the Griddler has easy & good recipes. I own a Jenn-Aire grill & I seldom use it because it is impossible to clean. My Griddler has replaced it because the food tastes just as good & very little clean up. I can cook 2 large sandwiches or 2 large pieces of meat (such as steak) in the Griddler. It will cook 4 burgers.You can cook on it with both sides down such as bacon or sausage on one plate & eggs or potatoes on the other plate. That makes for a quick, tasty meal!

  We bought a GR-4N via Amazon on February 10th 2013 and it has failed on March 22nd, just out of the Amazon return period.When we try to use the grill it heats up, the temp light turns green as it should.  But when we put a steak or hamburger on it the sizzling stops and the temp light starts to blink repeatedly.  The cooking stops until we unplug the grill from the wall and plug it back in.I am going through Cuisinart now to see about swapping it out.--------- Update ----------Swapping it out is a hassle, and involves a couple of steps.You have to get ahold of someone from Cuisinart and give them the serial number.  Then wait a month for a replacement unit to arrive.  Once it arrives, put your old one in the box and enclose a check for $10.  Take it to UPS or FedEx and ship it back to them.Including shipping it costs about $25 to get the new one.  For almost 1/4 of the cost of a new one, it is a pretty big hassle.  I expected more from Cuisinart, but they are charging top of the line prices for crap now.

So make sure too put something underneath it for easy clean up or just prepared to wipe the area where the grill is used.  However, it is a small connivence appliance therefore it does show its wear and tear in short amount of usage period. I have had the grill for about 6 months and have used it 3-4 times a week and the grill is definitely showing signs of use and I can see I may have to replace the grill parts sooner than expected.  The grills clean easily and as long as you clean it soon after usage.  I have hand washed the grills and all of the food from grilling comes off easily.

  I am a single guy, who up till a few months ago, had never tried to ""cook"". By cook I am referring to a dish with more than 4 ingredients, and mustard and ketchup don't count. I started using an online meal-planner and found quickly, that grilled food was done 1-2 times weekly. I needed to find an indoor grill that met my needs. This fit the bill perfectly. I scoured the internet and Amazon reading reviews about several indoor grills, and to be frank I was leaning towards a cheap George Foreman grill. I'd heard a million stories from everyone I knew and how simple and great they were. Well, that appears to be a thing of the past. It would seem that the great G.F. grills of 10 years ago, aren't made like they used to be. Moving on, I found this griddler at a great price here on Amazon. I did see that there were some bad experiences, but I felt like, more people are inclined to write a bad review, than a good one, so I gave it a shot.I've used this to grill several different meats: Salmon, tilapia, chicken, pork tenderloin, several cuts of steak, and burgers, of course.All, and I mean ALL, of the food has come out delicious, and good looking at that. I checked the food each time with a digital thermometer and all were well within the ""Safe zone"" for eating.The plates on this couldn't be easier to take off and put back on, and they clean, even after sitting for a day, with warm soapy water. The grease trap works well and cleans easy enough too.I have yet to use the flat side of the plates, nor the waffle plates that I purchased separately. So I can not comment on those. The griddler heats up in a very short time, and cooks very quickly. Two large salmon fillets were cooked thoroughly in about 4-5 minutes. The large pork tenderloin was 18-20 minutes.This grill is perfect for single servings or two people and I can have most of these grilled meals done in less than 30 minutes total time including prep. It has certainly expanded my options for great tasting meals and I am only upset that I didn't buy this earlier.One last thing to note is the size. The size of the grill is fairly large. I pack my grill away after each use, however, I also don't think it would be an issue keeping it on the counter at all times. It is a good looking piece of equipment and would look great out.I speak very highly of this product with friends and family, although for those lucky enough, the food speaks for itself.

  We use this to quickly grill hot dogs, veggie burgers, quesadillas, and sandwiches. It heats up quickly, and cleans up in a snap. I also purchased the waffle plates for it and they work very well, so I don't need a separate waffle iron. The plates secure firmly and the indicator lights let you know when the griddle has come up to temperature. The top gets very hot, but the handle remains cool. The only quibble I have is that plates aren't level when you open it up and lay it flat, so you can't really do eggs or pancakes or anything that's a little runny because it runs toward the grease drip pan. Also the top is quite heavy, so if you're making a pressed sandwich that you don't want mashed really thin, you need sturdy bread (or use tortillas/deli thins).We tried a different model (GRID-8PC) and immediately returned it. While the plates seemed heavier and the overall quality seemed better, the mechanism to secure them wasn't as good and the top plate kept falling off which was dangerous. Also, the plates weren't reversable, so if you had to store the extra plates to have both a grill plate and flat plate.

  This has worked well for us at least a year.Yes grilling outside is better but this can be very nice.It seems to get as hot as I want at the highest but it still isn't quite a grill -- besides you don't want the super high temperature cooking inside unless you have very very good ventilation.The absolute best thing is that the grill plates detach instantly once cold, and they go right into the dishwasher!  If you cook a steak or something at a very high temperature (or for a very long time) you might need to soak and lightly scrub for a minute or two before popping them in the dishwasher but if you do chicken breast or sandwiches, the grills are going to clean up perfectly without a hand wash.Sturdy materials -- good craftsmanship.  The cord is never long enough (I think for safety reasons) and the cord doesn't have a super easy wrap and forget in the back but it is close.Grilled cheese sandwiches are great just as panini.I haven't seen anything out there yet that beats this brand and model.

  I am on the keto diet and needed something to easily make chaffles to help me stay on track with my diet.  I also bought the waffle plate that goes with this.  I love this.  I have made chaffles and burgers on it so far and my food has turned out great.  The plates come off and are really easy to clean.  It's large enough to make 4 decent sized burgers and small enough to take a trip.  This is one of the best purchases I have made this year!

I made the very thick tomato, feta and spinach burgers from the Atkins diet recipe and they were cooked completely through and still juicy in 9 minutes, on ""sear"" with a nice brown crust. Waffles, using the waffle griddles sold separately, have been a little less successful but I'm improving.  I find i have to turn it to the highest heat setting and let them cook 4 minutes, that seems to be doing the trick now.  It has been sooooo esy to clean, and the drip pan works fine. No sign of any problems with the coating. Would definitely recommend this purchase.

  Well, my son and I love this item so much that after breaking our unit because it was dropped accidentally on concrete, we are ordering a replacement.  After last year's hurricane Jeanne we had to move from our home for 9 months to rebuild.  This was a wonderful splurge and we used it very often.  We were away from home in an apartment and used this to make many of the meats we would usually grill in our backyard.  My son learned to make grilled sandwichs and has become quite the Cuisinart chef.  Too bad he broke our first but we are ordering another without regrets.The unit heats up quickly, retains its heat setting, is very versatile and cleans up in a snap.  The interchangeable griddle/grill plates easily release melted on cheese and fats and they can be popped into the dishwasher as well.We love our griddler and are looking forward to receiving our replacement unit!  And as with all other Cuisinart products we own, it is well designed, is highly reliable and uses high quality components.

  We received our Griddler at the end of November, 2010 and have used it twice a day since and love it.  It makes great paninis, love the peanut butter and banana paninis, as well as grilled meats and chicken.  We turn it on, and by the time we prep our food it is hot and ready to go.  Have had no problems with grease spillage thus far. Grilling skinless, marinated chicken works great, with the grease tray catching any juice/fat, which we then use in gravy or stuffing.  We liked it so much that we ordered two more for our daughters, who absolutely love theirs.  I have never had a panini maker before, so can't compare versus others, but this works great for us.  Cleaning is a breeze.  Placed it under hot water faucet to clean off burned on grease residue, and it rinsed right off with a light wiping using a wet paper towel.  We live in an rv and this is rapidly becoming our favorite appliance.

    Marginal Performance Resulting in Poor Value
  
",2.0,TTU Fan,"Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2013","









  
  
    
  The thermostat on this unit seems to have great difficulty moderating and maintaining temperature, which makes it nearly impossible to adequately prepare any temperature-sensitive foods. For example, preparing something as simple as a grilled cheese sandwich is a lesson in frustration as at a moderate setting the bread is not grilled enough, but at even a slightly higher setting the cheese becomes too-well melted and oozes all over the platen. Similarly, attempting to prepare a simple salmon fillet generally results in an almost crust-like exterior with a marginally cooked interior at one setting, but is entirely undercooked at a reduced setting. There just doesn't seem to be much of an ""in between"" with this unit---it's either ""on"" or ""off,"" which is far from ideal. Steaks? Forget about it.I would not at all recommend this unit nor will I be using it with any frequency in the future, if at all.

    Best Indoor Grill
  
",5.0,M. Klein,"Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2012","









  
  
    
  This is the third indoor grill I have owned and it is hands down the best of the three -- I couldn't be happier.  I bought this grill to replace a George Foreman grill that I just couldn't get clean any more (and which didn't do the best job anyway).The Griddler does a better job of cooking evenly and is far, far easier to clean than either of the other ones I have owned.  I live in a basement apartment with no stove and rely on the Griddler for dinner just about every night.  It works great for salmon filets, chicken breast, hamburgers, pork chops, chicken burgers, turkey sausage and steak -- basically everything I have thrown at it.  I haven't tried the panini function or the open grill function yet.  The floating lid keeps your food from getting squashed on one end and undercooked on the other (a problem with the GF grill I used).  The variable temperature lets you cook fish properly but still be able to sear chicken, hamburgers, and steaks.  Cleanup couldn't be any easier.  The grill plates are removable and wash up clean with a little soap and water.  Fat drains off well, even though the Griddler does not sit at an angle like the GF grill.Bottom Line - I don't generally write reviews, but I was so impressed with this thing I decided to let others know.

  I've owned this grill for about 4 years now & we're about to replace it. It's been a good little grill. Makes the best grilled cheese sandwiches on the planet. Cooks steaks quickly so you have to watch them or they can go from undercooked to overcooked very fast & you'll miss the ""just right"" window.So why replace it? Well, grease build-up over time has caused the plates to smoke. No amount of cleaning will prevent this. And the drip spouts & plate hinges are fixed so that you can not rotate the top & bottom plates. This causes more wear on the bottom plate. Lastly, one of the plastic spokes that allows you to wrap the cord up broke long ago so the cord is always trailing around.I think this is just one of those neat little appliances that must be replaced from time to time. I could run it for a longer period of time, but it's gotten a little gross, so I'm opting to find another. But after reading reviews I may just pick up a newer model of this grill.

  I am impressed with this griddler; I have a few other Cuisinart kitchen items and a few are a bit unsteady, or they wiggle on the counter when moved.  Not this one; I tested out the folding handle and the drip pan insert just to make sure everything worked as described.  The folding handle has no looseness in it at all so you get a solid cooking platform for griddling, and the panini function I tested out by making a sandwich......... awesome!  I used to use a countertop convection oven, but I had to make little changes in the sandwich to get the heat all through the sandwich, but the panini plates do their job quite well.  Makes me wonder why I didn't get one of these to begin with.  I would rate 5 stars, but for the price vs. the competition, they should have included the waffle plates, which coincidentally, are out of stock on the company website until May 2013

We literally wore out Griddler # 2 (Griddler #1 was returned with a defective part and replaced, no questions asked). We love this new and improved design. Only 2 plates - instead of 4 - which counts in a small kitchen. The grease trap is a real improvement over the little cups that were sometimes forgotten and sometimes turned over! We decided to cook less with the cover closed, which seems to dry food out quickly, and we really like the result. The ""sear"" setting works great too. We use our new Griddler for fish to Cuban Sandwiches and beyond. I highly recommend the Griddler!

It was always a chore & difficult to try to get the grill clean.  After receiving the Cuisinart we made our first meal & it was so much easier.  When we were finished eating we removed the grill plates, just pop them out, & put them in the sink with soapy water.  They washed up nice & clean, all the way clean, & then when dry popped them back in.  Love the fact that the top flips open to double the grill size & the griddle plates that can be interchanged to cook things like pancakes & other items you don't want to press between two plates.  It's also nice to have adjustable temperature control for items that don't need to be on high.  The size it just about right for our family of 3 but if you needed to cook for more it's quick enough to cook additional right after the first batch.  I would have liked it to be a little bigger but it is sufficient & takes up only a small amount of space on the counter. Love this grill!  I would definitely recommend.

    5 in 1 Allstar Griddler is A Better Grill upgrade Griddler
  
",4.0,Mark Wolf,"Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2013","









  
  
    
  I decided to try this Grill for it's all purpose functions, easy to clean, and ability to grill a varity of different foods. As a Grill in the closed position the Cusinart Gr-4N 5 in 1 works well on the foods I have tried such as Shrimp skewers, Hot dogs, Hamburgers, Chicken Breast, And a varity of steaks. As a grill in the open position I tried Shrimp Skewers that created a mess to clean up. The top of the grill does'nt regulate heat as hot as the bottom as a griddle. When I made Pan cakes the bottom griddle did great, however the top cooked them vary slow and I had to rotate from top to bottom to get them cooked. This is the reason I gave the Griddler 4 stars not 5 stars. The main food I use the grill for are salmon fillets in the closed position and they cook up great. The drainage system is not very good when using marinades. I use canolia oil to season the grill in between uses and they clean very well. I will probably buy a large griddle for pancakes as you can only cook two large pancakes at a time and the griddle takes forever to cook them. I turn down the heat 1 setting as a closed grill to start my food and turn the grill up to high or sear the final few minutes two keep marinades from burning to the grill. Cusinart needs to go back to the drawing board on this product and come out with an improved version. The Warranty covers 3 years but as we use the grill at least 5 days a week for our diet I would be happy if it last for two years!! I read reviews about the grill pealing but if you season the grill with olive or canolia oil in between uses the grill's non-stick surface does not peal. I hope this helps others who are thinking about buying this grill. This was a good buy but not a great one. However I am just happy to have it as its 101 degrees outside here in Florida and the grill does come in handy for quick cooking in the closed position. I like the removable plates which I soak for ten minutes and they come clean very easy. The grill is fun to use and I don't get over heated like when we grill outside. The grill cooks fish, steaks, Hamburgers, Hot dogs, and shrimp very well. Easy to use.

My only negative comment is that the non-stick coating on the raised ridges of the grill side of the plates is already starting to come off.

  Our twin toddlers are picky eaters but we can get them to eat a variety of paninis. For ease of cooking and ease of cleanup, the Griddler gets 5 stars.One of my favorite features is the plates come out of the machine and can be put in the dishwasher. Also if those plates lose their non-stick surface, I can replace the plates without having to buy another Griller.One criticism. The hinges which allow the Griddler to open wide like a snake's jaw do not open easily. You have to press a button and then when you get the sides pressed, you'll often find that oil has dripped onto the counter. But I suppose without this ""snake jaw"" feature, you wouldn't have the ""open wide"" option, so the strength contains a bit of weakness.

    nice grill - poor quality control

  As for the Cuisinart GR-4 Griddler, the first one I received was defective (more on that at the end of this review). The replacement product I received works fine.  The Griddler is very stylish-looking with brushed stainless steel and ""retro"" styled knobs.  The top of the unit gets very hot during cooking and should not be touched without a protective mitt.  It takes several minutes to heat up, no matter what temperature you select, which I found a bit surprising.  It also takes a very long time for the unit to cool down once you are finished cooking.  It helps to leave the unit in the open position for faster cooling, but you can plan on waiting at least 30-60 minutes for it to cool down to where you can safely clean it.  A light on the grill/griddle selector knob turns red when the unit is switched on, and a separate light on the temperature knob turns green to indicate when the desired temperature is reached.  The product works as advertised.  It can be used as a panini press or opened flat for a two-section open-faced griddle.  There are two sets of metal plates that come with the Griddler - a flat set and a set with ridges.  They are coated with non-stick material and therefore only plastic or nylon utensils should be used with the Griddler to avoid scratching the plates.  The plates are easily interchanged and washed.  They are also dishwasher-safe.  You don't want to break or lose them - they cost $30 each to replace on Cuisinart's web site.  There are two cheap plastic collection cups that can be placed at the corner of the griddle to collect grease.  They are quite small, and do not hold much.  A cheap plastic cleaning tool is also provided to help clean the grill plates.  I have not needed to use it.  Overall, I am happy with the Griddler.  I paid $109.95 for it, which I believe is a good value.  It would be over-priced at the $199 suggested retail price.  Cuisinart's quality control and customer service with this product was surprisingly poor.  Before having to return the defective unit I tried to get a replacement manual from Cuisinart.  They promised to send one in 7-10 days which never arrived.  That's the only reason I docked the Griddler a star.Speaking of poor customer service, my first Griddler arrived from Amazon.com in an open shipping carton with the flaps loosely closed rather than taped shut.  The manufacturer's box for the Griddler, however, appeared to be unopened.  Nonetheless, the product arrived with no instruction manual or registration material, and one of the switches on the front of the product was loose and sparked when the unit was plugged in.  I returned the product for a replacement.  Amazon's customer service is terrible.  There is no telephone number to explain the problem to a customer service rep (I challenge you to find any phone number of this nature on their entire web site).  Instead you must request a refund or replacement by email.  They direct you to download a form to cut & paste onto your package to return the product by USPS (with no tracking) at no cost.  Alternatively, you can elect to send it by other means, although there is no mention of how they will reimburse you for the shipping cost (although they claim they will do so).  Since there is no telephone number to call for clarification, I would be very skeptical about it.  I sent my package back by USPS, but I have no way to prove it.  A company the size of Amazon.com should have far better customer service than this.  They should at least have a phone number you can call about problems with your order.  It is clear they would rather not have to deal with their customers about problems.  Having ordered thousands of dollars worth of merchandise from Amazon over the years, it has really made me think about ordering anything of major value from them in the future.Addendum (3/21/06) - since I wrote this initial review Amazon has added a link to contact a customer service representative by telephone.  To access it, click on ""Help"" in their main menu and click on the ""Ordering"" link.  To the right is a link to request a telephone contact.  I used this link for another order issue, and it worked very well.  The representative called me back immediately.  Clearly, Amazon has made an effort to improve their customer service.

  I enjoy the panini sandwiches I've eaten at restaurants so did some research and decided that by buying this Cuisinart Griddler, I could make my own sandwiches and so much more!  I've only used it a few times so far but the results have been excellent.  In fact, my husband was the first to use it for a New York steak, and he was very impressed with the results.  It seared the outside of the steak and the inside was nice and rare the way he likes it.  I've made two panini-style sandwiches on it, and they turned out very well.  Cleanup is a breeze--the non-stick cooking plates are lightweight, easy to remove and clean.  The built-in drip tray is a big plus for catching and removing oils and grease.  The ""floating"" cover is great for putting even height on thicker items.  Haven't used all of the available functions but look forward to making full use of it.  This griddler does the job of several small appliances so I'm able to do more with less!

  I like this thing. Easy to clean. Works fairly good but there are a few downsides. It takes a decent time to heat up and also does not hold the heat. Especially while in use. It has light indicators that say when it's at the temp you set it to. These are almost always off once you have any form of food on there. So I have to constantly set it to sear to keep it hot. But it works nonetheless.

  This grill works great!  I've used it many times grilling and also making sandwiches.  It's a great size for small family and it's easy to use.  Cooks food fast and the top allows you to press your sandwiches, just right.  I actually use it all the time.  Taking out plates and cleaning...a brush is an absolute must, is very easy, BUT as much as i love it, I absolutely HATE that the thing has the worst draining system for excess grease/fat/moisture.  Next to nothing drains away and therefore is cooked onto the plates or, the one time I used regular hamburger the grease spattered all over the counter.  The drainage holes in back are too small and not in right place so it doesn't drain properly or at all!.  I've only had to wash/empty the drainage 'pan/dish' a couple of times.  Would suggest using only lean meats with it.

  I waited a few weeks before writing this review on the Cuisinart GR-4N 5-in-1 Griddler. I wanted to make sure my first impression lasted and that I could give it a fair evaluation.In a nutshell, here is my evaluation: It is without a doubt the best appliance we have in our kitchen. We wanted a Griddler that could make panini sandwiches. It is a terrific panini maker. It is fun to experiment with different sandwiches, and we have yet to make a bad one.We wanted a Griddler that makes great pancakes. It is a terrific griddle that makes incredible pancakes.We wanted a grill where we can make bacon, eggs, hamburgers, hot dogs and other food you normally put on the gas grill. It is incredible in all these features.This is the best kitchen purchase we've ever made, and we have talked some friends into buying it.If I could mention one slightly negative feature to this Griddler: The top grill's temperature is slightly below the main grill/griddle. But, not enough for me to drop my 5-star rating.I can't recommend this Griddler enough. It has made our life so much easier, and has become our go-to appliance in the kitchen. Absolutely LOVE IT.

  We bought this 5-in-1 griddler to replace 2 George Foreman grills and a griddle that were taking space in our cupboards. We were really pleased with how it worked as a Panini press/grill, but when we made pancakes on it we were sorely disappointed. It doesn't heat up as well as our regular griddle does. On our regular griddle we usually turn the heat to 325 and we get perfect pancakes. With the 5-in-1 griddler we had to close it to preheat to 375, open it up to the griddle, and then adjust the heat from there. Our pancakes weren't as well cooked and didn't have as nice of a color as they did when we cooked them on the griddle. We definitely won't be replacing our griddle, but have replaced our two grills with this product, as it works great as a grill.

    Flawed grease catching design
  
",3.0,D. Kline,"Reviewed in the United States March 16, 2015","









  
  
    
  I use this griddler mainly for grilling hamburgers. Construction and operation is top-notch except for grease draining. While the meat is cooking, the drain effectively captures the grease runoff. However, when cooking is finished and you open the lid to remove your burgers, the top cooking plate swings out well behind the small grease catcher opening at the rear of the unit, and you end up with a line of hot grease on your counter top. Once the burgers are removed, it's best to close the grill until cooled to reduce further grease runoff to the counter. This obviously lengthens cooling time until you can remove the hot grill plates for cleaning. Other than that nuisance, the unit works fine.

  You'd think after all the george foreman's I've purchased I'd know that even if it shows 4 burgers on the grill then it can only really handle 2. That said, it works well, the grease trap is pretty yuck. The plates are level with a little divot out of the back so you constantly feel like it's about to over flow with grease and the divot isn't going to drain properly. It seems to drain ok, but after every burger you feel like you need to scrap some of the grease out rather than with the GF, it just drains out as it cooks.The different settings are complicated, but I wanted more control over the temperatures so I guess be careful what you ask for.

I would have given this 3 stars as it works ""okay"" although to get it to cook anything I have to set it on high; for example on my old electric griddle I used to cook pancakes at 350, on this one it needs to be at 450 (as high as it will go) to get them to cook at all.  I gave it one star because it is 20 days later and under average use with no abuse one of the support legs on the back is already broken... the cast iron is that brittle.  I am hoping that Cuisinart will replace it.

  I bought this grill a couple of months ago. The first thing we made was bacon and eggs on the griddle. They were ok, but they took forever. I would prefer to do bacon in the microwave and eggs in a frying pan. I used it for grilled cheese on the griddle. It was great, and fast on sear so don't leave it on too long or it will burn the cheese. I've made steaks, and again, watch them. I like mine rare, but it cooked so fast I got it well done. I know better now.I love this grill. The grills are so easy to clean right in the dishwasher and the built in grease catcher is great. It doesn't take up any extra room because it is under the grill and does catch all the grease so there's no mess. I like the idea that there are temperature controls so the temp you select is maintained throughout the cooking time.Great product. Would recommend it way over George Forman grills.

  We thought and hoped this would be a good replacement cooker for the WolfGang Puck Griddle we had got from HSN close to a year ago. We had been very satisfied with the WGP Griddle which is a similar multipurpose griddle to this one.  But the WGP Griddle was being recalled due to safety issues so we were looking for something at least as good as or better.  When we saw the Cuisinart griddle on Amazon and at a great price we thought this was it!  Also the vast majority of the reviews were 5 star...  Well....  It turned out to not be that good after all and is being returned as I write this.  We love pancakes and this griddle makes terrible pancakes...  Even after it is heated up on high temp and appears and smells like it is smoking hot, the pancakes seem to take forever to brown up...  They turn out a pale yellow and stale looking..  Normally pancakes will bubble up on a hot griddle almost instantly and if not turned over soon they will get quite dark...  You dont have to worry about dark pancakes on this griddle.. We think the problem with this unit is that it heats up ok but doesn't maintain the temp.  When the pancake batter is put on it cools the griddle plates down and takes too long to heat back up.  It probably works ok to heat up sandwiches...  We are wondering how well the ""waffle plates"" work on this??? Can't imagine it would be any better and probably worse..  Also we didn't like that you can't control the temp of the top and bottom plates separately...  We want our WolfGang Puck Griddle back and Cuisinart can keep this one..

",4.0,JLT,"Reviewed in the United States November 25, 2016","









  
  
    
  This is my second grill of this type. I loved the first one but while opening it somehow the hinge on the back broke. The hinge is made of a cheap plastic type that is very brittle. Cuisinart did say they would replace it, once I sent it back at my expense and included a $15 check to have it returned. They do not sell the piece separately because the other end is inside the frame and you would have to take it apart to get to it.  Aside from that, I really like this little grill. I can fit two medium sized steaks and asparagus on the grill (one side, using as press grill) easily, but it isn't HUGE on the counter.  It heats of quickly and cooks evenly. You can also get a waffle grill which I wish I had known before buying a separate waffle maker, but I haven't bought the attachment.  This is a great little grill if you are just VERY careful with the hinges when you are flipping the lid around. The plates are easy to change also, non stick surface is good.  This is a 4.5- 5 start product if they would put good metal hinges on it instead of the brittle  plastic /metal composite that it appears to have now.

  The Cuisinart GR-4 is simply the best grill/griddle I've owned. It is easy to use and so versatile we use it every day. It has convenient LEDs to indicate when the surface is at the temperature you selected. Instead of three static temperature selections (HI-MED-LO), the Griddler has a rotary dial so you can fine tune the temperature. It comes with both ribbed and flat grilling plates that are a snap to change. It comes with 2 drip cups and a nice scraping tool that is molded to the contours of the ribs to make cleanup a breeze.This particular model is perfect for 2 person households. If we're in a hurry and want a quick tasty meal, the Griller cooks both sides at once so we're only minutes away from grilled sandwiches with melted cheese and soup, quesadillas, a quick burger, the possibilities are endless.Suffice it to say this is one of the most value-added, time-saving purchases I've ever made.

  I wanted to like it. I wanted to like it so badly. I kept it for over two years and kept attempting to use it hoping that it was just in a bad mood, or I didn't have it turned up high enough, or it would work better this time.The thermostat: a major, major problem.Expect all cooking to take forever. It'll reach the correct temperature, and then turn off. Wait five minutes for it to figure out the temperature's dropped, and then it'll turn back on. Wait another five minutes for it to get increase in temperature, it'll get where it's supposed to, and it'll shut back off. Imagine the world's worst electric stove top and you get something close to this experience.The reviews were so good I really thought it was something I'm doing wrong, or I had a bad unit. I really thought it had to be me and not the product. But it's not. It really is that uneven.The features are fantastic.

  If you fry anything greasy and lift the lid, the grease on the top panel drips all over your counter top.  The George Foreman type grills are designed much better.  In addition, the bottom and top heat unevenly ALL the time, no matter what settings you use.

  I was envisioning a larger grill (I know, I know, read the measurements...) and was a little disappointed when I first unpacked this.  I've found that it does exactly what I bought it for, though - I've used it several times a week for anything from breakfast sandwiches to burgers to grilled cheese.  You wouldn't be able to make very quantities of eggs or lots of pancakes; if looking for a griddle to do that, you may be better buying a single griddle machine instead of an all-in-one.  The plates are VERY easy to clean and one of the main reasons I grab this instead of a pan when cooking - I just throw the plates in the dishwasher, and often they come clean without any pre-rinsing or soaking.

  1 star is too many for this product. We have Cuisinart pans and we are happy with them, but this was their first small appliance we bought - total disappointment. The plastic knobs do overheat, but what made us mad was that it totally ruined Mother's day - it decided to not work, and it was just the third time we used it. So no grilled stake on Mom's day.Warranty is of no use giving all the trouble to send it and pay shipping; the griddler part still works so we decided to stay with the half product we've got for the whole price. I opened it to see if it was fixable and saw that right under the heating element they have all the electronics - easy to see why it breaks so easily with all the heat burning the circuits. What kind of engineer designs something like this?Cuisinart is definitely crossed out of our list of quality suppliers. I recommend you do not buy this, it is a piece of junk.

  Is very easy to use. Hard to clean grease and dirt out of grooves sometimes. Some spots get much hotter than others so you have to move food around to get it cooked evenly. Heats up fast and is best option for quick inside grilling. We enjoy it and would recommend. Bought a second one as a gift for someone.

Highly recommend to anyone who just wants good food cooked quickly, correctly, easily & doesn't want to have to worry about a ridiculous clean up.

  I had a nice Krups waffle maker. When it came time to clean up, because the plates were stationary; I worried about ruining it. So thankful when I received a notice from Amazon about this. I wasn't even looking, but when I got the email I couldn't pass it up--I got this because it has changeable plates. I wanted to make waffles and be able to put plates in the dishwasher. I bought the waffle plates, a cook book, and some grabbers. I didn't need the book or grabbers. It came with some recipes and a sm remover that worked just fine. Were not panini people, but looking through the recipe booklet that came with it, I'm thinking this will be great for grilling steaks inside.

  I waited to make my comments after I have used it for awhile. I can tell you our Cuisinart Griddler is a handy unit! Quick BLT's Cook Like 4 slices of thick bacon in about 7 minutes. No splattering grease everywhere. Of course you must let the unit come to heat first.Slap the bacon in there close the lid prep the other goodies and wa-la! bacon is done.Talk about a nice quick burger maker. Pre-made burgers cooking time is around 5 minutes on middle of High on the dial.The cooking time is less than 1/2 the time verses using a skillet on a burner having to flip your food over. Cook your fresh caught Alaskan salmon or halibut steaks in like 3 minutes! Yum.....Oh yeah you don't need any oil on the surface-It's non-stick unit. One could still apply their favorite oil, butter, mayo, or spray on stuff.

  Hinge is magnetic, so it does open to lay flat on large sandwiches.  My old one was permanently hinged which made the stuffing of my sandwich squeeze out - not with this one!  Did fish fillets with grilled fries last night.  Having the temperature control is excellent.  Only wished that each half could have individual temperature controls though, but its good enough.  Drip pan is a very ingenious design and doesn't require wiping down the appliance itself at all.  just pop the grills, drain the drippings from the pan and slam into the dishwasher - cleanup it done!

  Just used my grille for the first time last night. Cooked 6 - 3/4inch boneless pork chops. The book that came with it said to cook the chops for 4-9 min. Took all of 7 min and they were perfect. I let the grille heat up for 10 min and when I dropped the chops on it, got instant sear marks both top and bottom. The controls also have a green light that comes on when it is hot and ready. Was going to use pam non stick spray but forgot to. Didn't matter. Nothing stuck to the grille. Had a George Foreman one and it cooked good but clean up was horrible. This one was so easy as the cooking plates come off of it and are reversible with a flat side.  Love this grille/griddler !!!!! Defiantly recommend if you are looking at it, buy it !!!! You will not regret it. You can also buy waffle cooking plates for it too. Wish I had known that before I bought a waffle cooker. Oh well. Now I can make more waffles faster.

  This Cuisinart Griddler is a great product, similar to a George Foreman grill. It's not too heavy, but is durable and seems like it would be very long lasting, especially if you take proper care of it. It's quick to heat up and very easy to use. You could be the worst cook and still fair well with this! It's also very easy to clean with removable plates and a removable drip tray. I love that new and other types of plates (think waffle) can be purchased for this Griddler too! Lastly, the system can fold as you see in its product picture or easily transition to a flat griddle surface for pancakes or crepes. Everything with this Cuisinart Griddler is easy and pretty self-explanatory. It was an awesome purchase!

  I've had other counter-top grills before, but this one definitely ranks up there at the top. Grill and panini temperature controls and different cook surfaces make it easy to grill just about anything. The top also adjusts as it sets itself down on the food, so it grills evenly. And given the cook surfaces are removeable, cleanup is a snap either in the sink or by throwing the plates into the dishwasher. The only negative is the separate drip cup- It has to be lined up perfectly on the countertop or you'll have a mess (and it's easy for it to become mis-aligned when you're opening and closing the grill). It's also easy to forget to use it in the first place, but I suppose that's my problem because I'm just used to there being a pan underneath that slides in and out. That said, I think this product would be even better if it had a mechanism like that..

This is a great home and travel item for grilling, making grilled PB&J for the kids (and adults), and for cooking all sorts of things like sandwiches, burgers, and more.Most of all, I love the removable plates. Not only can you flip them around for flat and grill surfaces with a side-by-side option making this excellent for burgers and pancakes, but it is easily cleaned! Since most of the panini makers DON'T have removable plates, this feature makes this item a no-brainer. Seriously, if the idea of a panini maker caked with cheese, crumbs, and other food gunk makes you queasy, go for this one - you won't be disappointed.

  Bought this griller about two months ago after looking at it for about a year as a possibility. We bought a big RV recently and were looking for things that would make cooking on the RV easy and fun. This RV has a big diesel generator so we can have 120 volts any time we need it. However, we have started off using it at home in the kitchen and my wife and I have been delighted with this griller. We have used it approximately 15 times, primarily for grilling paninis which it does beautifully. We have been surprised that it does such a great job on steaks. All in all, we have been delighted by this griller and wish we had bought it earlier. This will definitely go with us on the RV and we will probably buy a second one to keep permanently here in the house.

  I have used my Griddler two or three times a week since it was delivered in November.  It makes great grilled sandwiches, and is very handy for grilling fish, chicken, and hamburgers.  It also does a nice job on pancakes and French toast.  There are two issues that I have with Cuisinart.  One, the lights on the control switches are difficult for a tall person to see, and two, the overall construction seems to be a bit on the light side.  I do believe that with a little care in using it the light construction should not be a issue, and the location of the lights is a minor design flaw, and not even an issue for those under six feet.  On the plus side, it is fast to use, and easy to clean up.  I wash the removable non stick plates on mine by hand, but Cuisinart says they are dishwasher safe.  All in all I have enjoyed using the Griddler and would recommend it.

  Actuallly 4.5 stars. I had a 5-in-1 for 5 years and loved iit. Only probblem was eggs before solidying and grease going over the back; then it would sometimes get caught on the inside where the plates sat, and it was a pain to clean. Also, it was wobby and the plates were not seated levelly. Still, I used it all the time and loved it. Rarely used my oven. Even though I live alone, I like to cook and store, and it was large enough to cook extras for me or for guests.When I was tired of looking at the parts I couldn't clean, I decided to be cheap and try the 3-in-1. Big mistake. Even if you're single, I definitely recommend against it. It was wobbly, you couldn't regulate the heat, no two-sided plates and the plates had white gunk on it even after cleaning. All I could do was cook one thing.So I did what I should have done in the first place:  Bought another 5-in-1 and was pleasantly surprised to find that:- it wasn't wobbly- the plates were better seated (more firm, and level)- they had extended the over-flow tray in the backI've used George Foreman, two older versions, and they were a chore to clean. I don't see how you could beat the 5-in-1. It's a brilliantly designed griller/griddler, and I heartily recommend it for the following reasons:PROS- two-sided plates allowing for grilling and griddling, no storage of extra plates necessary- new and improved over-flow tray- space-wise is perfect (no wasted space) and yet could yield 8 hamburgers if you open the top to full extension- cooks eggs, pancakes, bacon, salmon, hamburgers, grilled veggies and more perfectly- you can control the heat- plates are removable and are very easy to clean . . . plus they hold up wellOh, and I just learned a trick wiith runny eggs:  Use the included grill cleaner's long side to ""block"" the runny eggs until they solidy if your counter isn't perfectly level like mine. :)CONS- wish they would extend the overflow tray to be wider in the backI love this machine, and I'm sure you will as well.

  The design seemed so promising, but it fails to deliver. It works OK for sandwiches, and it works well as a griddle, but as a grill, it fails. Due to the fact that the heating element only goes around the edges of the grill or griddle plate, it cooks unevenly. A piece of bacon on an edge cooks quickly and shrivels, while a piece placed in the center takes forever. Of course, this also applies for steaks or chicken breasts -- the edges cook way before the middle. It's a shame, because the clean-up is a breeze.

  The first time I tried to use my new griddler, I attempted to cook 2 filet mignons on the ""sear"" setting.  The green light (indicating the unit has heated to temperature) illuminated fairly quickly.  A little too quickly.  As I placed the steaks, it was obvious the grill wasn't hot enough.  I gave it a chance, though.  After 10 minutes, they were barely turning color.  I flicked some drops of water on the grill plates and they just sat there.  I returned the unit to Amazon, easy-peasy.The replacement unit heats properly and grills meats and vegetables as expected.  I'm looking forward to trying paninis soon. :)

    Cooking with the Cuisinart GR-4 Griddler
  
",5.0,PennyLane,"Reviewed in the United States January 18, 2007","









  
  
    
  Let me say, right off the bat, that I am very pleased with this purchase.  I had been looking for months for an indoor grill and had done a fair amount of research before ordering this one.  This combination grill and griddle is the right size for my small family.  It is attractive, simple to use and easy to store.  I love the removable plates.  I just snap them off and put them in the dishwasher to clean. Last night I cooked salmon fillets on the grill.  I was a little worried about doing this - after all, good fresh fish is pretty expensive and I didn't want to overcook them.  Not to worry - they were done to perfection.  We have cooked eggs, pancakes, burgers, veggies and bacon on the griddler.  The bacon is super because it is not all curled up and overdone the way it sometimes is when cooked in a skillet. I am happy to recommend this product.

  We were so excited to get this and use it. The machine is heavy and well made, but the plates are light weight and very expensive to replace when you need to. The slant isn't quite right and the grease goes over in many places, not just the spout so you get a greasy counter to clean. When you have the griddle open so you can also use the top as a base, the liquid from that part does not fall into the drip tray, It drips just short of it. It's pretty easy to clean with just a sponge if you soak it for a bit but food tends to hang on in the creases and you need to use a brush or other tool (use very gently or the coating comes off very easily). The more we use it, the harder it gets to release the trays. It does cook the food well. You have to decided if the cooking quality beats the easy of cleaning quality.

  This worked pretty well for 4 1/2 years, then mysteriously stopped working: the main power light comes on, but the plates don't warm up, and neither of the control knobs makes any difference. They don't have a repair manual, and they don't sell parts, so I can't fix it. Otherwise, it cooked ok with some uneven heating, and the plates are a little thin, so they gradually warp over time. The raised ribs on the panini side of the plates are not very high, so it doesn't give you quite the effect that more expensive panini presses do.

  I have been very happy with this purchase primarily because of the easy clean up. You can detach the grills and put in the dishwasher.  I however am hand washing them due to less wear on the nonstick surface.  I like that the grease moves to the side groove of the grill and there is no overspill.  I had a little George Forman and the clean up was ridiculous; grease on the counter, and residue on the grill that was hard to get off.  I also like the versatility of the grill and the temperature range.  This is a wonderful grill!  I highly recommend the  purchase.  It is also more reasonable on Amazon than on other sites.

  The panini press works pretty well, but regardless of settings - tried em all - the top plate doesn't get as hot as the bottom one, so you really have to flip your sandwich to get it evenly browned. I also purchased the waffle plates and they're pretty useless, for the same reason; the top just doesn't get as hot. The instructions say to use the griddle setting for waffles, but on that setting the top doesn't get hot at all. With the panini setting the top will get warm, but not hot. Flipping waffles? Silly! I'm going back to using my 1959 GE waffle iron with the cloth cord. Still works like a charm, even if moderately terrifying when the cloth around the cord gets hot!

  So far, I've only used this to make paninis, and it's perfect. Takes a few minutes to heat up - a little more time than it takes to assemble a simple panini (sample: sour dough slices, roast beef slices, mayo, sauer kraut, and cheese slice). Press for 30 seconds and then cook for another 3 minutes. Turn it off. Lift the grilled panini off and cool on a rack for another 3 minutes before slicing diagonally and enjoying. Butter (or apply olive oil) the outside of the bread for added flavor. Once cool, the grill plates are easily removed and cleaning with a sponge and soap is a snap. You can make several in a row, but once cooled, clean so you don't end up with black burnt bits on your panini.

  We have used this tool for everything from grilling fish and steak to making pancakes.  Everything went well.  A slight negative I have is that the griddle takes quite a bit of time to reach full temperature, but then it works well.  Another issue we have seen after a couple of months is that the top heater does not seem to heat as hot as the bottom heater.  That means some uneven cooking, especially when the top is turned down to cook something like pancakes.  Those on the bottom heater get done quicker than those on the turned down top heater.  As long as you know this, you just turn those quicker so you can get around this issue. That the plates and the drip catcher come out to put into the dish washer is excellent.

    What's not to like about grilling inside. Great kitchen tool
  
",4.0,fastreader,"Reviewed in the United States June 29, 2013","









  
  
    
  We had looked around for an inside grill and finally settled on this Cuisinart unit.So far it has done everything we wanted it to do. We are just waiting for the waffle plates to arrive so we can try that out as well.Regarding the panini process we like to pre heat the unit closed prior to putting the pannini in it and that way we get the nice grill marks on the outside.When used open as a double grill the bottom half seems to generate more heat than the top. Once you know this it's not a problem to tailor the foodthat goes on each. Having it open with the two grills means you can do the whole meal on one appliance. Definately an advantage

I can cook fish, chicken, and steaks in just 3 minutes or less. And it's very easy to use and clean. A great product all around. I give it an A+.

  I love this girdler! I'm not big on kitchen appliances for Christmas but this Cuisineart Griddler is superb.  I use it about twice/three times a week for paninis, grilling chicken and more.  Easy cleanup, easy prep.... Good quality dials with high contrast lettering/numbering makes it easy to select the function and temperature.  The non-stick grill plates appear to provide even temperature and cooking across the plate.  One caveat...the top seems to be a bit heavy which caused the panini sandwich to flatten a bit as it cooks.  If you place spinach or other veggies in your sandwich the steam from the vegetable moistens the bread.  Also don't use spread on the bread...it too makes the bread soft thus making for a thin panini.  I'll have to buy another for my RV cause it's that easy, fun and delicious.  Amazon had a good price on this too...

  We love this griddler!  So much so, that when we had to replace it, I went back to the exact same model.  We use it primarily for paninis - not fancy, but even a grilled cheese is better cooked on this.  My husband makes plenty of hamburgers on this, and we've used the flat pans for eggs and pancakes.  I've heard that are waffle inserts, so I have to look into that one for hubby's birthday.  The operation is simple, and the machine is sturdy.  Ours was treated quite badly for a time - hence the replacement - otherwise, I believe it would have lasted much longer.  It is a bulky appliance, though.  It's a rounded top with the handle sticking up above it, so you can't stack on top of it.

  .  For pancakes this Griddler certainly does the trick.  It is easy to use and quick to clean (the non-stick cooking surface pops out easily).  The pancake pen helps to achieve the perfect circles I'm looking for.As with some gifts given by a spouse, she bought it for herself as much as for me - but she uses the panini press more than anything.  We use it primarily with cibatta bread and it does a great job with paninis when the right amount of pressure is applied.  I follow the cooking instructions that came with the Griddler and the paninis consistently come out great.The way it is designed allows you to set it up in many different ways as described in the product description.  The only flaw I've noticed so far is that the drip tray doesn't work as well as I would like.  It is designed so the grease is funneled to the drip tray; however, I've found that it doesn't always follow the desired path and occasionally doesn't wind up in the tray. Overall, great purchase.

  The first one that was delivered had some issues where the top grilling plate was not hold securely by one of its latches so there was a risk of it falling off. Returned that one and got a bundle deal of this griddler plus waffle plates for less money. This is our first time doing panini and they turned out fine, with a good crust and cheese melts inside before the bread is scorched. Easy cleaning because you can remove the plates. Warm up time is a bit long - about 3-5 minutes so you have to remember to turn it on before you start assembling your sandwich.I think it is a bit underpowered for what it is advertised to do - tried grilling marinated chicken breast and then steak and both look more like braised than grilled. The green light (ready to cook) goes dark once you put a steak on it and it was never green again during the cooking. Looks like this steak was too much for this grill.

There's a warranty, but I'd have to pay to ship it there, and add $10 towards shipping it back. Investing 1/3 - 1/2 of the value of the item to get it repaired doesn't seem worth it, especially when the plates are wearing out, and who knows what else could go wrong a month later.

I bought a Crofton grill. It has no controls. Plug it in to turn it on and pull the plug to turn it off. It does have two lights. The plates are not removable and a major project to clean. I wanted removable plates and the ability to control the temperature in order to sear a steak to get a bit of flavor so I bought this Griddler. It is a winner. No point in my repeating the details. This cost about 4 times more than the Crofton and it is many more than 4 times better. You will love this Griddler. 'Nuff said, get you one. It has everything.

  Pros:1. Works as advertised - it is a grill, and, when the plates are reversed, a griddle. The plates are non-stick and easy to clean.2. Heats up a bit slowly, but, once hot, gets food ready surprisingly quickly.3. I love the fact that it leaves grill marks on the food.4. The steel casing seems to give it a classy look.Cons:1. The non-stick coating is rather flimsy - I scratched it while rinsing it under the sink faucet (it lightly grazed the faucet).2. The outer casing gets very hot - keep out of reach of children.3. A timer would have been nice. When creating a sandwich in the morning, it would have been helpful to have some preset timed shut-off feature - would have saved me the need to baby-sit the thing during busy mornings.All in all, I would recommend this product.

",4.0,Henry Coryat,"Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2015","









  
  
    
  Once I figured out how the device worked, I was able to use it without any further problem.  The first problem I encountered was in opening the Griddler to the flat position.  There is a small lever on the right arm which is identified as allowing you to open the top half to a horizontal position, but I struggled quite a bit pushing it, and pulling it, and turning it in every direction until--purely accidentally--I felt it release the lock on the top half.  The instructions should include a clear explanation on how to use this lever to get the desired result.Subsequent to my purchase of the Griddler, I ordered the waffle-making plates.  I thought they would snap in place with ease as the grill/griddle plates had.  I found that the side clamps would not close.  I thought I might have to grind down the underside of the clamps so they would close securely on the waffle plates.  I knew that the odds were on the side of the manufacturer rather than on the side of a confused customer.  And I was right.  In examining the slots on the waffle plates, I noticed that there was a slim fin, which unlike the similar slots on the regular flat plates were not exactly in a center position but closer to one side of the waffle plate than the other.  When you positioned the waffle plate with the fins in the closer to the top position, the side clamps could not clear the fin to securely hold the waffle plate in position.  However if you turned the waffle plate over and the fins were in the lower position, the plates snapped into place.figuring this out nearly drove me crazy.

It takes a good amount of applied force to get the plate on the lid to sit properly without hanging off just a little bit. It looks negligible, but can and has affected the heating of the plate.

  I was very puzzled by the disparity between reviews on this product.  People seem to love it or think it is junk.  I had to send the first one back as it did not open or close properly.  The 2nd one is working very well.  After reading several negative reviews, I was waiting for the plastic clips to melt after using it.  I've fried an egg on it, I've grilled a one inch steak, I've made countless waffles, a panini and a quesadilla.  Nothing has melted that I can observe.  Many of the problems I've read seem to involve the unit getting too hot or not hot enough.  I think that this is caused by faulty thermostats.  It's just a theory but it could explain many of the problems that people are having with this product.I've read that the grates are dishwasher safe but I handwash and dry them in the hopes that they will last longer with the extra care.  My boys love the waffles that I'm able to make with the waffle plates.I'm happy with it.  I'll try to remember to post an update later on regarding how it is holding up.

  My wife wanted this for Christmas and I must admit, I kind of rolled my eyes at the idea.  But, I got it for her and now I am the one who uses it the most!  We've only had it about a week, but I've used it most every day...sometimes twice a day!  Couldn't be happier with it!  The plates are easy to pull off and clean.  We've grilled plenty of paninis, hamburgers, and even toasted some rolls.  Works like a charm!UPDATE: Well, we seem to have the same problem a lot of people do.  It wasn't more than a few months after I wrote the first review that the darned thing broke on us.  Something must have come loose on the inside because the plates never get warm enough to cook anything.  You can let it heat up for several minutes and still put your palm on it.  It was awesome while it lasted.

  I ordered this for my wife for Christmas 2011.  One or the other of us use it at least 3-4 times a week.  I usually cook Tilapia on it, but we cook burgers as well, plus panini sandwiches, and about whatever else we decide to.  You have to spice up the burgers a bit, or else they have that plain, stove cooked taste.  We're planning to get the waffle grids for it.  It isn't good for cooking eggs, due to the small space of each griddle plate.  Our full sized, regular griddle is much better for that.  Other than that, I expect it to be a regular member of our kitchen for many years.*Update: Got the waffle plate back in December 2012.  It is a wonderful addition.  We love it.

  Since purchasing the Griddler we've made burgers, toasted sandwiches, blueberry pancakes and sausage (recipes included with appliance- YUM!) and tuna steaks.  What a time-saver and energy saver too.  Everything cooks quickly and evenly, (although the tuna was a bit over cooked simply because of cooking both sides at once, I over-estimated the time but will adjust next time).  We've used it for breakfast. lunch and dinner; we've used it on the kitchen counter and on the patio table in our enclosed porch-it works beautifully and clean-up is a breeze; let it cool and then either wipe down after toasting sandwiches or remove the plates and load in the dishwasher.  Easy, quick, we absolutely love it.

  This is a good appliance for making hamburgers and paninis on the grill, but the griddle side didn't work as well. I've made hamburgers twice already and they came out very well, but when I tried to make pancakes on the griddle with both sides open the top portion didn't get hot enough. So much for that idea, but if you do use it for pancakes, there is room for four large pancakes when the unit is open. Maybe I didn't start the griddle setting on high enough, but I was following the recipe booklet, so your experience might be different. Anyway, I bought it to make burgers so I'm happy. And the plates are easy to remove and clean...

  The griddler has been a great addition to my kitchen.  I have had it for about two years now and use it about once a week.  My family loves burgers, paninis, and pancakes.  Making pancakes is a breeze when you open it up allowing you to cook six pancakes at a time.  Panini sandwiches come out perfectly crisp with the center warm and gooey.  Burgers cook up perfectly in about 7 minutes.  The only con I have is that the plates are shot.  The smooth plates have broken down to the point where I need to replace them.  It makes me wonder if we are eating some of that non-stick surface with every meal...

  After reviewing several panini presses, I ordered this one and have been very satisfied. I prepare paninis 2-3 times a week, grilled cheese sandwiches once in awhile and have flipped the plates and made pancakes and eggs. Grilled hamburgers a couple of times. Everything works completely as expected. Paninis are great. Be aware that when grilling hamburgers be sure to check and empty the grease tray. I forgot the first time and after the second set of 4 burgers, the tray was completely full. Luckily, I caught it before it overflowed. This griddler is easy to operate and removing the plates makes clean up a breeze. I really like the top that articulates so thicker sandwiches are evenly cooked instead of having to be pressed flatter.

There are a couple of models but this one is so good because you can remove the plates to wash them (or put in dishwasher).  I cook burgers, fish, sandwiches.  Haven't used for eggs or pancakes but only because I'm just not big on those.  Very EASY.

  This is a great product - lightweight, easy to clean, versatile - and oh, yeah, it makes great sandwiches!We've had fun experimenting with different items - right now, one of our favorites is to split a croissant.  Spread both inner sides with Nutella. Slice a banana lengthwise and lay between the two croissant pieces. Just panini the croissant until warm - yum.I like that the bottom of the appliance stays cool - I especially like that the plates can be put into the dishwasher, although they are so easy to wash that it's not usually necessary.  The griddler is small enough to easily move around and yet big enough to handle enough food.  We have lots of small appliances but this one gets used.

    Plates Rusted
  
",2.0,Waldo Jaquith,"Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2014","









  
  
    
  After a year, the plates rusted in the dishwasher. The cost for replacement plates from Cuisinart? $80. For two pieces of metal. The rest of this griddle is apparently valued at $4.95.11/30/2014 Update: Cuisinart has increased the price to $100 ($50/apiece) for the griddle plates (part #GR-4NRGP). At this writing, the entire griddle goes for $64.99, which tells me that I should go into the griddle plate arbitrage business, buying grills for $65 in order to sell the plates for the low, low price of $40 apiece (netting me an 18%--a tidy profit).

  I received the Cuisinart GR-4N 5-in-1 Griddler as a gift a couple of years ago.  It works well as a panini or grill in the closed position.  The open griddle does not work well at all.  Pancakes do not cook well due to uneven temperatures between the plates.  Great idea, the product just does not perform well in the multi-use way it is supposed to.  I am disappointed.  Maybe the company will improve this product to work properly as a griddle and then I could give it a 5-star rating.

  I've used George Foreman grills for years, and I ordered a Griddler 5-in-1 because it seemed to be more flexible than the Foreman grills. Bigger grill, flippable to use as a griddle, and temperature control. I'm judging this as a grill, not a griddle. I hadn't seen a Griddler until I opened the box from Amazon. I wasn't happy with the Griddler:1) The case, particularly the upper shell, gets very hot. Hot enough to burn; I slightly burned myself the first or second time I used it. I'm used to a Foreman grill, which has a plastic top cover, which is not burning hot.2) The top of the unit is a part you have to handle a lot, as when you go to close the the unit on your food the first time you have to use a hotpad to unlock the top so that it floats free and doesn't squirt your food off the front of the grill. Every time you open the grill this swivels loosely, making it easy to burn your forearm. If you want to stop it swinging (and possibly dripping fat in back of the grill) you have to latch it upright, putting you back to the beginning when you want to close it.3) Having the cup under the unit and fill from the back is nice idea. What's doesn't work is the expectation that the grease will flow off the back of the unit and into the grease cup. The grill plate is flat, and the Griddler holds it flat. The grease pools on the surface instead of flowing to the cup. If the plate had a design which gave a slant to the grill this would work, but if that was done the unit probably couldn't be used as a griddle. The slanted design is what the Foreman grills started.I expect this unit makes a great griddle, but it's not a very good grill, especially if you cook food that has much fat in it.I have returned this unit to Amazon and purchased another Foreman grill.

  This is a great little griddle.  I love how it can grill a burger or a grilled cheese sandwich, and also unfold, totally flat and make pancakes and french toast.  The plates are super easy to release and switch, and they seem to be nonstick, because they come clean with a swipe of the sponge.  The little fork-like scraper that's included is also useful for removing, say, cheese from between the grills.

    Griddle or Grill Panini indeed
  
",4.0,spamkiller,"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2016","









  
  
    
  Cuisinart GR4N first impression notes:Both top and bottom heating elements are hard wired in parallel, although the wiring to the top element is longer and of smaller gauge. This will make the top (lid) element run at a slightly lower temperature due to I²R losses. Both elements are cycled on and off by a relay on the ""Griddle"" circuit board (a rather puny one for 13 amps by my estimation). It seems that the ""Griddle"" temperature control knob cycles this relay at the temperature preset (controlling the temperature of both elements simultaneously) but it is unknown where the temperature sensing thermistor is located; there is no exterior wiring from the ""Griddle"" circuit board to a thermistor, only two wires to the 'lower grill present' safety switch. (If the lower grill element is not in place the unit will not heat.) We must assume it is mounted on the 'Griddle' pc board.There is a fusable link in the hot lead, which is wired to the 'Selector' switch. 'Selector' switch closure to ""Griddle"" energizes voltage to the element control relay contact. In the ""Grill Panini"" position, voltage is still applied to the control relay contact and additionally to circuitry which supplies the ""Grill Panini"" thermostat control. It should be noted that neither control is a true thermostat, merely potentiometers with LED's in the knob that are turned on by the 'Griddle' board circuitry when the desired temperature is sensed.It appears that the ""Grill Panini"" control is nothing more than a second thermostat potentiometer that is selected by the ""Selector"" switch in the ""Grill Panini"" position. The 'Grill Panini' knob circuit board has no second thermistor and is nothing more than a cross connect board and a mounting platform for a large ac capacitor, with all wiring routed back to the main ""Griddle"" board..Since both the lid and the bottom grill heating elements must operate by design as a single unit, it is unclear why a second ""Grill Panini"" thermostat is needed at all, which also brings into question the need for a 'Selector' switch at all when a mere on/off switch would suffice, creating a simplified unit with only a single knob.This is further confirmed by lid open or closed, either thermostat control will cycle the elements, depending on the position of the ""Selector"" switch, and they both seem to have similar positional symetry as to temperature in spite of the labeling.The heating elements are of good quality and the unit is almost completely metal, with few plastic parts. The internal wiring is all high temperature oven type wiring with welds for attachment. The two circuit boards use conventional components and do not look like they are high temperature rated (above 80°C), although the bottom case is vented and there is a second aluminum heat shield between the boards and the heat element lower tray.So what is the electrical difference between ""Griddle"" and ""Grill Panini""? And why do we have a ""Selector"" switch?? Unknown other than sales pitch. I called Cuisinart customer support and they don't know either so don't waste your time. Use either one, they seem redundant.

  Purchased this Griddler as a replacement to a GF.  2 reasons for replacement purchase: (1) capable of turning off with having to unplug it[GF biggest drawback] (2) Removable cooking plates [again some GF's has removable plates but I found none with on/off]This is a great product.  Cooks very evenly on both sides with excellent temperature control (ie. things cooked on the stove uses the same temp on the GR-4).Have not actually used the griddle side but if it cooks like it does with meat products, I should be very pleased.The only drawback with the GR-4 is size.  It is considerable smaller(lid closed). The GF could cook 25-33% more product.  Maybe Cuisinart will make a bigger one in the future.I would recommend this to others for general everyday use.  Large gatherings would be an issue.

  We had an older model of the grill that we used almost daily.  However, after a few years of that heavy use, the grill plates were no longer coming clean. We opted to replace the entire grill rather than just the grill plates.The new model is somewhat different than our earlier model. On this one, the grill plates are lighter and reversible (one side ridged; the other one flat.) our older model had two different sets of plates. The old plates had grease drip spouts and it came with a plastic cup to catch the grease. The new model simply has a continuous lip round the grill plate. The lack of a spout is no big loss. In our use of the earlier model, the grease cup rarely had anything in it and never very much. The earlier model had distinctively different top and bottom grill plates. The new ones seem to be interchangeable.The big performance difference is the cleanability of the grill plates. I use rubs and seasoning on meats that stick to the grill plates (as well as other cooking items). This model comes with a heavy plastic scraper that makes cleanup an easy process.We use ours primarily for grilling meat - boneless pork chops, burgers, chicken breasts, steaks. It does a great job.

  The grill works very well.  The grill's contact plates are held in place by metal tabs that seem very durable.  The area of the cooking surface is not as big as it seems in the photos.  Also it does not drain as much grease as other contact grills with contact plates that have deeper grooves.  It is easy to clean and it heats up quickly.  I typically grill lean meats or burritos on it.  I also use the optional waffle plates to make waffles.The only reason I did not give it 5 stars is because of the size of the cooking area and grease drainage for fatty cuts of meat.

Hamburgers, chicken tenders and chicken breasts have all been good. Pancakes on the hot plate were slower than my previous griddle but were cooked satisfactorily. The only problem so far was a mechanical one. After the second use, while removing the plates for cleaning, the plastic retainer around the upper plate release button, fell off. It would not stay in place after this until the metal tabs on the retainer were spread out. The griddler has been used 4 times since then with no further trouble.

  I bought this and have used it a couple times now and I have to say, I am very impressed.  The construction is very sturdy and in-line with Cuisnart quality.  It is very sturdy, easy to use and heats evenly.  Food tastes great and the integrated drip tray that slides inside the bottom of the unit catches a lot of unwanted grease.  The removable grates are easy to clean and a quality non-stick material.  I had no problem grilling salmon with the skin on.  It didn't stick whatsoever.  My sister has the former boxer's grill and by far, this one is built much better.  I am  very pleased with this purchase, even if it does cost a few dollars more.  It is worth it!

  The whole idea of a 5 in 1 appliance is very attractive for anyone with a small kitchen, and this is one so far works very well. Makes panini sandwiches, waffles (purchase the extra plates), pancakes, hamburgers - in fact anything that you would cook on a flat or ribbed surface. It's easy to take the square cooking ""plates"" out for cleaning, too. I am heeding the reviews of others who indicate that the non-stick coating on these plates chips rather easily. I don't scrub, I don't use metal utensils, and I definitely don't put it in the dishwasher.Recommended.

    Plastic Tabs Will Break.  Newer Version Has Metal Tabs
  
",2.0,AHM,"Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2012","









  
  
    
  We bought one from Amazon and loved it, but the tabs that hold the plates in place broke on the very first day.  We later found many online reviews complaining about this.  We returned it (love Amazon's convenient return policy), but because we loved the grill, we decided to buy another one from C***co.  To our surprise, the new one looks identical, but it had metal tabs instead of plastic, so obviously Cuisinart has discovered this flaw and updated the product.How can you tell: If you have black tabs holding the removable plates down (there are four of them, one on each side, top and bottom which are released by pressing the button on the side), then they are plastic.  The new ones are shiny metal.  In fact, the entire assembly underneath, of which the tab is the end, is now metal.  The pictures on Amazon for this product, as well as on the Cuisinart site show the black plastic tabs.In the previous version of this review, I had said it was the same model number, but I retrieved the box and it is in fact a different model no - GRID-8NPC.  I can't find that model listed anywhere. Its possibly a C***co only model no, but there was otherwise absolutely no other difference we could see.I have uploaded a picture of the new version.

  I like the functionality. You can use as waffle, then panini or plain grill. Easy to clean also. I bought the waffle grills separately. No issues on waffles and pancakes. I tried grilling the zucchini and had to cut round instead of strips to help it cook faster. It took a bit of time but it got the job done. I laid the grills flat and instead of enclosed.

  It is a nice product, but the lid leaves a little to be desired.  It does not easily transition from a flush close to an elevated close.  I found it cumbersome and difficult to maneuver.  The biggest issue is trying to adjust its position while hot.  Additionally, the griddle feature would not lay completely flat without a bit of effort.  The reviews compelled me to buy the product, so perhaps I just received a defective item.  I sent it back.  Cuisinart often produces an impressive product, so I'm hoping they revisit the lids design.

  First time Cuisinart has ever let me down.  The griddles do not lay flat, so when you make eggs they want to run out to the grease pan.  And the grease pan is a devil to get out for cleaning.  Griddles take awhile to heat up and then loose heat very quickly when food is placed on to start cooking.  Might be good for sandwiches, but i doubt it based on how fast it cools.  If you're looking for an electric griddle, do NOT buy this one!

They are reversible which is very convenient, I don't have to store extra plates. This is such a versatile little grill! Can be used as a press, grill, or griddle and takes up very little counter space.My daughter uses hers daily, but I have only used mine several times. I was pleased with the results each time. So much easier to clean than my old George Forman without removal plates. Great to grill steaks when it is too cold to grill outside on the gas grill.

  We'd been thinking about getting a panini grill for ages, and we finally decided to give ourselves one for the holidays.  It was a fantastic idea because we use it at least three times a week.  It's made dinner a cinch and we enjoy thinking up creative combinations.  It's so easy to switch between grill plates and griddle plates.  Because food is being cooked from both upper and lower surfaces at the same time, cooking time is reduced.  You have to remember to use the drip cups if you cook things that will produce juices (like chicken breast) or fat (like bacon) or things will get messy.  The plastic scraper has been useless so far, but the non-stick plates are very easy to clean.

    Cuisinart Grill is good, but has one flaw
  
",3.0,Kenneth F. Aft,"Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2013","









  
  
    
  This grill was a replacement for my George Forman, which was disappointing for several reasons.  This Cuisinart cooks very well, much better designed that the Forman.  However, after the first use, the spring switch mechanism that releases the plates did not work for the top plate.  I had to manually pry it open with a knife blade because it did not retract on the left side.  I am tempted to remove the top inside cover to see if I can reconnect the slider mechanism, but I am a little afraid that I will not be able to put it all back together.  This is not serious enough to return the whole thing--it cooks well and I like it a lot, but this defect makes it hard to recommend to others.

The temperature dials correlate to accurate temp readings on the contact surface and I have produced dozens of fabulous sandwiches since it arrived. I even grilled a sandwich pre-wrapped in parchment paper because it contained gooey chocolate. I bought the optional waffle plates and, like this machine, I would give them 5 stars.

  The grill works very good, but to use for Panini the lid should swivel more into a flat position so that the food has the weight pressing it evenly. When you use it for a thick Panini sandwich it is higher in the front than the back, so it tends to squeeze the Panini crookedly.  When you look at the picture, imagine the lid coming down on top of the food and staying at that angle.  The heat produced is sufficient, it's easy to clean and switch the plates around.  So, I'm happy with it except for the angle for cooking thick items.

I will strike this as first attempt and possible mis-setting of controls and will give it another shot. Looks like regular grilling and pannini use are most effective uses.

  My husband was begging me for a George Foreman grill for awhile. I did some research and decided to order this little beauty instead. We love it. We bought the waffle plates, as well. We have owned it for a year and couldn't be happier with our purchase. We love to make paninis, tuna melts, and waffles in it. The clean-up is super-easy, thanks to the removable plates. I'd definitely recommend it.

",5.0,Math Tutor,"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2011","









  
  
    
  I have used this product almost every day since it arrived in my home. The grids change from grill to griddle in a snap and it works wonderfully when  making a Saturday breakfast of pancakes and breakfast meat, each on a separate griddle. I previously owned George Foreman grills and wanted a change. This is definitely superior to any product I have used before. The temperature controls make fine tuning of the level easy and the ability of the upper grid to come down directly on the items, rather than from a hinged position, allows for more even cooking on chicken breasts and other items which might not be exacly the same thickness throughout.

  Love this machine.  We borrowed our neighbor's Griddler during Mardi Gras to make Cuban (pressed) sandwiches for a crowd and it worked so well we ordered one from Amazon the next day.  Well made, heavy, feels professional.  Really like the tilt-able lid that allows you to press food flat or with a 1.5 inch gap between the two plates for doing pressed sandwiches.  Plates easily remove for cleaning and can be flipped over for a flat cooking surface.  Great price from Amazon.  Highly recommended.

It can fit open on our table so we can cook or keep things warm on it as we eat. When open it is an even surface and has been very good cooking both as an open griddle and closed like a griller. The plates snap off and on easily - very nice! Just make sure to put the top plates on the top (as marked) and the bottoms on the bottom. We have had good success with steaks, burgers, bacon, waffles being cooked on it so far. It has been a one of the best cooking utensils that has been added to our camping trips to date.

My old one got used several times a week for years when it finally wouldn't turn on and its bottom plate was completely worn. Given the heavy use for so long, though, that was to be expected. The new one works great. The one thing I won't do again is run the plates through the dishwasher. It only takes a few moments to wash them by hand, and I'm sure they'll last much longer.

  It takes a few minutes to heat up, but it cooks meat to perfection.  It leaves a good sear on the outside, and the meat is juicy.

The plates come out easily and you can either stick them in the dishwasher or just rinse them off.  It folds up to a size that is easy to store, but when you open it up affords a large grilling surface.

  I have used the product twice so far and each time it makes a real mess.  Let me explain, the grease splatter comes out of the grill and all over the counter space. I now have to find something to cover the counter with. It took more time to clean the counter than the product. The griddle works well, it does but another thing about it I don't like is how it drains.  The grease from the meat and things off of the meat block the pathway. You have to watch it and make sure it's draining. If I had to buy another I wouldn't. Our old foreman worked much better as to the draining and no mess on the counter top.

Sometimes it seems the fat stays in one place and i have to manually have to scrap the oil to the back and sometimes it spills over onto my counter.

    Works well, but broke during first use
  
",3.0,Disappointed,"Reviewed in the United States August 2, 2012","









  
  
    
  Product works well, and continues to work however a component broke during use.The griddler uses hard plastic components to lock in the reversible/removable grill plates, and clearly they get more brittle after heating.  After my first use I went to remove the plates and the top plate had some trouble getting out, I went to examine why and one of the plastic retention clips wasn't actuating (there's a little button that makes them rotate out for removal, but when pressing the button the clip in question did nothing).  I picked up the unit to inspect it, and I heard a rattle - the sound of a metal piece rolling around inside the frame of the unit.  I rotated the unit around and shook out what turned out to be two pieces, a hard plastic clip and a thin, 1 inch metal tube that it clearly connected to.  It's clear that the hard plastic they use gets really brittle after heating, and upon inspection the plastic retention clip is actuated by just pushing on it so it rotates, a simple design but if the plastic is really brittle then it gets easier to just break the clip than to rotate it, which is what happened.I'm continuing to use it until I can get in contact with Cuisinart or Amazon regarding getting a new one, because it functions well outside of this problem and the other clips are working okay, so it might be one of those items where it is worth getting another if it means being careful.  The clip that's broken is on the top plate, so I'm a little worried about safety at the moment, but it does still hold the plate on.  Other than that, it cooked hamburgers well and toasted up some paninis in a good way.I gave three stars because it is a good product except for one silly mistake, using a hard plastic piece that can break easily during regular use.  I don't know why they went for that kind of plastic or didn't do anything to make it more heat resistant, it seems like one of those engineering issues where the original engineering called for a different material, but this one would ""probably"" work (or ""work well enough"") and would save $0.02 per unit, so they went for it.

  I ordered the waffle plates too and have now (in the three days I have had the gridler) used it for 4 different types of cooking. All very wonderful outcomes. My only worry is the little clips that hold the grill plates on. I hope that with careful attention to them that they will last for a very long time. The product does feel a little flimsy, but dang, it makes GREAT food. I ordered it to replace both our gridle and our waffle maker. I'm thrilled with my choice to combine the money it would take to get two appliances into this one dandy kitchen friend. I recommend this highly.

  I bought this for myself for my birthday last month, and I am very pleased with myself.  I also bought the waffle plates. I use the griddler 3 or 4 times a week for grilling meats, vegetables and bread (for crostini).  I've used it for breakfsts: bacon, eggs, pancakes, french toast and , of course, waffles.  It is great for panini's also. I love that the cord wraps around the back for storage and that it cleans up so easily--all the plates can go in the dishwasher. The upper plate does not heat quite as much as the lower, but I don't have a problem flipping things over, if necessary.  Also the timing and temperature of the waffles in the recipe booklet is a bit short for crispy waffles.  I jack up the temp about 50 degrees and add 3 or 4 minutes to what it shows in the booklet and they come out fine.  Overall, I love my new toy!

  I was replacing a George Foreman Grill that I've had forever, and which finally died.  I really liked the fact that this grill has removable plates for easier cleaning, and the flexibility to be used as a press or a griddle.  The surface area is a little smaller than the grill I was replacing, only holding 4 Bubba Burgers where I used to be able to cook 5.  Not a problem.  However, even while allowing the grill to heat up until the light goes on and the dials to the hottest temperature, it took the frozen burger patties forever to cook.  I also had to re-position them, as the corners of the grill near the back corners weren't getting as hot as the center and the food was cooking unevenly.I'm also disappointed that the waffle plates for this grill appear to be more expensive than the grill itself.

  This Griddle is amazing and perfect for the ""on the go"" people. We are a very active family, and our kids play a lot of sports, so we are always on the go. This baby heats up fast and cooks very evenly, and if so easy to clean up. I looked at the pictures put up, and we have not experienced any of that spatter or nastiness shown in those pictures. Its VERY easy to clean, the plates come right off and go into the dishwasher. The machine itself just wipes down in seconds. Then the next day, its ready to go again. It comes with a real handy cooking guide and some good suggestions on recipes. We have cooked fish, chicken, hamburgers, hot dogs, and even some grilled cheeses, and they came out wonderful.We have not used the griddle plates yet because we have a griddle on our stovetop, and have not had the need to use those, so I cant say anything about that, but the machine is definitely worth every penny. The brushed stainless steel looks great on the counter, with a nostalgic look, and 3 heating dials. Very Retro looking indeed. I highly recommend this Griddle. Enjoy.

  I bought one of these griddles from Amazon & only used it a few times, never at anywhere near the highest heat settings, and the heat it put out melted the plastic grease drip pan that fits underneath it.  I have to wonder if this isn't a fire hazard.  If it gets so hot underneath that it can melt it's own drip pan, is it not also possible it might catch the grease on fire?  That didn't happen for me, but it was enough of a concern that I didn't order another one.  To Amazon's credit, they took the griddle back and credited my card with no problems.

In the less than 2 months we have had this, we have cooked chicken breasts, blue cheese stuffed NY strips, sandwiches and pancakes. All turned out excellent. For a short time I was cooking for three instead of two and found that cooking 3 sandwiches was a bit difficult--much easier cooking only 2 sandwiches at once! So why only a 4-star rating? I'm only giving it 4 stars because it needs to come with a spare set of plates--mine are always needing to be cleaned due to use!

",5.0,Maryann Penner,"Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2015","









  
  
    
  I waited some months after buying this to write this review because I wanted to actually put it through it paces first.First, the feature I do not use: This thing has the ability to open completely allowing you to use it as a flat, larger single sided grill or griddle. I already own a larger flat electric griddle and a cast iron grill/griddle that I use for these purposes when needed so that was not really useful to me but I see where it would be to a single person or small family with limited storage space.As I said, I have had this for 6 or 7 months now and have used it fairly extensively for the 2 purposes for which it was bought, cooking meat and making Grilled Cheese sandwiches/paninis.This thing rocks at grilled cheese! My son and my favorite is a grilled cheese with ham or bacon on rye and you can easily prepare them 2 at a time on this grill. Reverse the plates and the same can be said for paninis.Cooking meats can take some trial and error to get right. It is very easy to overcook something. If you think about it, this makes perfect sense. Because it's cooking from both sides at the same time, things cook faster, so you have to get used to it. Personally, I have taken to using an instant read thermometer to check the actual temp of steaks and chicken breasts and the like to avoid any such issues and have found that to work out quite well. I have also found that it also takes a bit of trial and error  to learn what temp setting to use with various items but you should quickly get the hang of it.Clean up: This thing is great. The cooking plates pop out easily and are some of the best ""non-stick"" items I have come across. The things will almost literally wipe clean with a paper towel even after cooking something with the stickiest of marinade/glaze. I wash them with the rest of my dishes in soapy water, dry them in the rack and pop them back in to device and it's good to go.The grease trap on this is also quite well designed. It is of sufficient size to handle pretty much any meal with fear of it filling up or over flowing. I have cooked a dozen 80% burgers on it and it hasn't even come close to being full. But perhaps the biggest plus is that it works really well. I have had a few of these devices where the the design and traps did not really contain the  grease all that well. This one does the job quite well and without the angles and large flairs I have seen on other devices.There is also very little to no splatter while cooking so cleaning the main part of the device is as simple as giving it a quick wipe with and damp cloth or sponge (after unplugging, of course).I would say the only real limiting factor to this device is its size. It would not work for a bigger family. I can easily cook a half dozen 5 oz burgers or boneless pork chops at the same time. Perhaps 4 or 5 bone-in chops (depending on the size) and 4 nice sized boneless chicken breasts also work out well. I have also done a few nice sized london broils on it with good results. But with 1 lb porterhouses, you will be limited to 2 at a time. So if you are cooking for 2 or 3 people, this should work out well for you. Any more than that and you might want to investigate other possibilities.Bottom line for me though is as somebody who is generally cooking for only 2 or 3 people, I love it. It works well, cleans up easily and is easy to tuck away on a shelf when not being used.

As a college kid with no stove options for cooking, this 5-in-1 has allowed me to expand my menu from microwave-only to a whole new realm of relatively quick food options.  So far, my biggest regret is that I waited so long to get it!Pros:The griddler is easy to cook with after a bit of a learning curve of its temperature controls.  It's not a range top, so it's not going to match a gas burner for heat, but it's hot enough to sear a steak, make an omelette, etc. The main reason I bought this brand rather than others is the configuration of the heating element, which creates an even heated surface with minimal hot/cool spots, and it does so quickly (only a couple minutes from cold to ""max"" heat).  Cleanup is easy with the removable plates and steel construction.Cons:Ignoring for the moment that I only paid $70 for this, I do wish the 2 surfaces had independent temperature control.  And grease doesn't drain well... but it's not designed to be a Foreman, it's supposed to be pretty flat!

  The Cuisinart 5 in 1 Griddler is a good concept, but it doesn't get hot enough to cook anything at a fast pace if it is unfolded all the way...which is the way I would think most people would want to use it.  It took forever to cook bacon, until it was folded over.  It works great as a panini press, or to grill a burger on both sides at the same time.Positive: Good size, easy to store, and very easy to cleanNegative: Doesn't get hot quickly, doesn't get hot enough when opened all the way to grill on both panels separately

  I recently received it and have used it several times for making Chinese style pie (beef bun, see my pictures in the picture section of this item) and pancakes. It works perfectly well and super fast! I am so impressed and couldn't be happier. Wish I have bought it sooner. It is pretty compact, which is extremely good for my tiny kitchen; looks very cute and modern; no unpleasant smell from the pans even when I first used it. I also love it for that no smoke comes out from my cooking and temperature is controlled almost precisely. When I make pancake, I close the griddler. So I don't need to turn the pancakes and they are cooked even faster! I plan to cook french toast and more Chinese pie £¨±ý£©soon. Strongly recommended.

The temperature settings are great and the removable plates go right into the dish washer which is just AWESOME!  No fuss cleaning!  I also like that I can use the plates as a griddle or a grill or both, one of each on each side. Being able to open it fully and use both sides as once is an awesome feather.

  First thing I would like to point out is the REMOVABLE AND WASHABLE griddles!!!!! The top griddle does a ""fair"" (best I've seen so far)  job at matching the temperature of the bottom griddle so your food cooks evenly top and bottom. My wife is a panini freak and loves how well it evenly melts the cheese on both sides without burning the bread.I've had it for a few months and it gets quite a lot of use and it seems quite durable/reliable. So far I'm very pleased and was worth the $$$.

  I bought this for my husband and we love it. It makes a great grilled cheese, or any other grilled sandwitch. It also grills chicken and fish quickly and evenly. As for the plates, I had read that putting them in the dishwasher was not recomended, so I have been hand-washing them and that has been quick and easy. The plates are really non-stick and any cheese or fat that is left over from grilling comes up quickly and easily. Getting the plates on and off is also a snap, both literally and figurativly.

We have only used it for grilling, but it does a fine job and cleans up very easily.We did have a concern before buying it that it would be much larger than the Foreman and we would not be able to store it in the same place.  It is not larger (might be a bit smaller) and stores great.

  I do highly recommend this appliance.  My kids and husband use this all the time.  Now I don't have to cook nearly as much as I used to.  They use it as a press for everything sandwich.  I over cooked the boneless pork chops I made on it, but the family still loved it.  The 12 year old even cooks burgers for the family now.  I say it was a good purchase in our household.  The only drawback is it does not wash itself and does not clean the counter where my family made a mess.  Since they are apparently untrainable, Cuisinart needs to come up with a solution to this problem  :)

  Disappointed.  I bought two of these December 21st, 2014 as Christmas presents - one for my husband and one for my 76 year old dad.  My husband's works fine, but my dad's is broken.  He tried to use the Griddle to make pancakes and tried to use the griddle on the top portion as advertised, but the top portion doesn't heat up enough to cook a pancake.  So my dad called the warranty department at Cuisinart.  They told him they would provide him a new one, but he had to pay $10.00 for shipping.  Then he had to ship the old one back to Cuisinart.  That cost $44.00 plus $16.00 for the box and packaging it up for him by the UPS store.  All told a new unit is going to cost him $70 which is about $14 bucks or so short of what I actually paid for the darn thing.  So 50% of the units I bought were bad and my dad has to basically buy a new unit himself.  Crappy service and support by Cuisinart.

  I bought this for my husband for Christmas because he loves to cook and we always enjoy paninis from PB.  We have only used it three times so far, but I love that it gives him another way to explore his creative side in the kitchen.I did a TON of research before finally deciding to go with this product. I was torn between this one, the one that offered the ""hovering lid"" option and the more expensive one where the additional plates were sold separately. While I really liked the idea of the hovering lid, I wanted to give my husband more options with the grill, griddle and open-flat surfaces. One of the attractive features of the more expensive ($200+ more) option was that the heating elements were inside the plates. However, that version only came with two plates and I would have to pay $80 for each additional one I wanted to order making it an almost $500 gift to get the same thing this one offered). As much as I love my husband and as much as he loves to cook, I just didn't think we needed a $500 counter top appliance.So far, we love this product and haven't had any of the troubles others reported having.  We haven't tried to grill anything extremely greasy, but the drip tray seems more than sufficient to me. The surface is sufficient for making two large paninis (e.g. french bread or sourdough) at the same time. The plates seem durable and we hand wash them with ease, so we avoid any risk of them being damaged in the dishwasher.

I'm careful to remove excess fat and residue between batches by blotting with paper towels and removing with tongs. Also do not wash grill plates in the dishwasher; aluminum and the alkali soap don't like each other and the non-stick finish will deteriorate quickly.

",4.0,Reviewer of Things,"Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2014","









  
  
    
  I really like this grill and the only complaint I have is that cleanup is a little tricky.  I like to remove the grates while the thing is still hot so that it's easier to spray off all the grease, however it's very difficult to remove the grates using oven mitts.  The grates are not angled so that the grease slides into the grease cup underneath, so after I'm done cooking I have to push the grease to the back of the grates into the grease collector.Other than those minor issues, this is a great grill.

  Love this grill. It’s become my go-to for dinner. I just throw a Stark’s or chicken etc on the grill. Close it and come back to perfectly cooked meat, not all dried out or over cooked. Clean up is a breeze. I’ve used this for multiple dinners now and each time it’s taken me just minutes to clean it and put it away.

BUT....... DO NOT TRY TO SCRAMBLE 3+ EGGS on this unit.  I had eggs going all over the place the day I tried to scramble 6 eggs...LOL... it was a mess.  The little edges on the flat griddle were not high enough for all those eggs!!!  So, unless you want to be cleaning eggs up, think twice (like I should have!!!) before using it for scrambling large amounts of eggs!

  We had the previous model of the Cuisnart griddler which we loved.  We replaced it this year because the teflon was wearing out.  This model the GR-4N does not heat evenly.  We primarily use this griddle for making pancakes.  The bottom or front griddle always cooks the pancakes faster and more evenly than the top or back griddle.  It takes significantly longer to cook a batch a pancakes with this griddle because half the heating surfaces don't work properly.

  We've had this Griddler for nearly four years now, and it still works.  The plates are removable, which is great for cleaning - we throw ours in the dishwasher.  The top of the grill sometimes makes me nervous - it swings fairly freely, and I wish it were more stable like a George Foreman.  This is also a larger grill, so you need to have space to store it AND the accessories.  I believe this came with a plastic scraper and a fat catcher, but those have long since been discarded in favor of the dishwasher and a simple bowl.

  I've only used this item a few times, as we also have a larger griddle that is more suited to the needs of our large family, but I haven't been disappointed yet.

I also purchased the waffle plates separately for this appliance and have used them a few times to make pretty good waffles. We don't use it everyday, so I'm sure it'll hold up for many years.

  This griddler does what I expected it to do and that is make my grilled sandwiches. I always seem to overload my sandwich and this griddler saves me from flipping said sandwich. I tried meats on the griddler an incline to the drain is a must. I recommend not using the top of the griddler in a closed fashion. When doing meats leave the griddler totally open, where the grease goes when opening the griddler might not make it into the drain. If you do wish to grill meats with the griddler top down I recommend paper towels under the back or middle of the griddler.

  We have used a Foreman grill for years, and I always hated cleaning it because the model we had did not have removable plates. I read the reviews that the Foreman grill with removable plates did not get very hot. I picked this one because it had the controllable temp and the reviews seems to indicate it would get hotter than the Foreman. It does frozen boneless, chicken just fine and without completely drying out the meat. My 14 year old uses it a lot, both me and I will use the Griddler more than we did the Foreman simply because it is so easy to clean. The drip catcher works really well. I haven't used it as flat griddle, so I can't comment on that. I felt like I was getting a great deal because I had a gift card. I would definitely have paid full price now that I have used the Griddler. If you are looking for easy clean up, a dependable high temp, and a step up, I doubt this model can be beat.

I love the fact that I can use it in the closed or open position to cook and the results are the same - awesome!  I was skeptical at first because I thought the cooking surface would not be big enough, I was surprised to find that I can actually cook four nice size burgers at the same time or I can cook two T-bone steaks with ease.

  These customer reviews are a very important benefit and so it was that before purchasing the GR-4 Griddler, I noted how many reviews gave it a 5-star rating while a large number also rated it much lower - mainly because of a reported problem with the coating of the grill plates. But ""throwing caution to the wind,"" I went ahead and bought the GR-4 with the following experience. Thus far I have used my Griddler three (3) times using only the ""griddle"" plates and to my surprise, there on the surface of the bottom griddle plate have appeared several visible ""cracks"" which weren't there before!... I have been very gentle in cleaning after each use by soaking the plates in soapy water and using a sponge to whisk away any burnt-on remnants and so I was startled when these cracks appeared. As far as cooking goes I am pleased with the results that the Griddler turned out but because of the coating problem I am only able to rate it at 3-stars, and I would advise any potential buyer to pay attention to the comments of those who rated it at only 1 or 2-stars!

  This is my first counter top grilling appliance, and I could not be more pleased.  After hearing friends, and family telling us how easy it was to prepare quick and tasty food on them we decided to get one.  After reading all the reviews I could find, we opted for the Quisinart Griddler GR-4N.  The best money I have ever spent.  If you are looking for this type item, go for it.  If you decide on the Griddler make sure you get the GR-4N, not the older GR-4, some of them are still out there.  The GR-4N has taken the minor complaints and changed for the better.  No more cups to catch grease, it's built in now, and the plate system has been made better.  The unit looks great, but it is also small enough to store when not in use.  I have become a huge fan of Amazon.  When I ordered this unit, it was scheduled for a Thurday delivery.  My wife and I had decided to make Panini when it came. Not to be, it came in damaged.  I put in a return good request, and checked damaged.  One hour later I had a return label, and a new one was on the way for next day delivery, which was Saturday!  Great customer service!  I hope this review helps in your decision to get a Griddler.

  We use this a lot!  It has finally found its place out in the open on the counter.  I wish it had waffle plates included but they are available separately.  It toasts evenly and effectively.  And we LOVE being able to put the plates in the dishwasher.  Can't beat it for perfectly grilled burgers indoors or the perfect lunchtime panini.  It does not dry out your food like a Foreman does but it does have a grease catcher for excess drippings not critical for good taste...

  It doesn't get as hot as a normal cheap-o griddle.  It cooked slower, and I suggested that maybe it cooks more evenly than a normal griddle that just gets super hot... My husband always cooks on the griddle --it did seem to be slower and not a sizzly-hot as our old griddle.  I will have to update my review after we've used it a few more times.Also - the plates were already peeling their non-stick and had to have it replaced upon first receiving.

    Excellent electric grill - not!
  
",1.0,Philip Jones,"Reviewed in the United States April 19, 2012","









  
  
    
  My original review is below.  I have changed the rating from 5 stars to 1 because I experienced the problem other reviewers reported. During normal use the clips that hold the grills to the unit broke.  These clips are plastic and flimsy.  This one feature turns an outstanding product into one that is unacceptable.==================================================================================================================================================I just ordered my second Griddler.  I have used one for about 4 years and the element just doesn't heat up like it did when it was new. So it is time to retire it. (I can relate.) I live on the 8th floor of a condo building.  Charcoal grilling is not practical.  The Griddler is a pretty good substitute. Addendum: I just received the Griddler and it has a couple of significant improvements. I have edited my review to reflect the new featuresFeatures you will like:(1) It cooks top-botton (illustrated) and it lays out flat.  So it makes grilled sandwiches, pancakes, burgers and steaks.(2) It has griddle settings (by temperature) for pancakes and sandwiches and grill settings (low, med, high, sear) for meats.(3) It had two reversible plates with two surfaces.  One is flat, for a griddle.  The other has grill ridges.  The plates snap in and out easily.  Unlike previous versions of the Griddler, each plate fits both the upper and lower unit.(4) Clean up is as easy as it can be.  The cooking plates snap out for cleaning.  They are coated with a non-stick surface, which greatly eases the cleanup job.  But some stuff still cooks on.  A hard plastic tool is provided that makes it easy to scrap off anything that sticks withoug damaging the surface.  Just keep after it and the plates will last a long time.(5) Grilling and griddling drips oil.  There is a built-in drip cup to catch it. Easy to remove and clean.(6) The sufaces are rectangular, not round of oval.  I find this shape very practical.(7) Waffle plates are available separately.I think you will like the Griddler better than other electric grills.  The new design has all the good features of the model I have used for 4 years plus some very useful improvements.

  I was skeptical at first about ordering the Griddler - after all, I first saw it on TV, so who knows about as seen on TV items!  That being said, this thing is GREAT.  I live in a state that gets really cold in the winter and hot in the summer, and I don't want to always have to grill outdoors- but George Foreman grills with their tough to clean surfaces are for the BIRDS.  I also wanted a griddle before purchasing this, and that's what tipped me towards buying it (since it's two in one).  I cannot tell you guys how wonderful this is.  It makes eggs & pancakes like a champ with the griddle side of the plates, and it grills chicken to perfection with the grill side.  I LOVE that you can easily open up the grill or griddle all the way and use the plates flat.  It doubles your cooking surface area!  I do this to make grilled cheese (which, by the way, turn out perfect every time).  And unlike most indoor grills, you can control the temperature with the Griddler.  That's awesome because you won't wind up with anything charred.I haven't had any problems so far with it working; it works great, heats up fast and everything.  It is SO EASY TO CLEAN, which is one of my favorite features.  You literally just press a button and pop the plates out, wash them, and pop them right back in.  It takes me 3 minutes, tops.  What can be better than that?In short, the Griddler is highly recommended!  It may seem expensive, but to me it is WELL worth it!  I plan to buy one for the next set of newlyweds I encounter!

  We previously bought a different cheaper griddle maker.  After we realized how much we used it, when the other one wore out (quicker than it should have), we shelled out the extra cash for this and have not been disappointed.  It heats more easily and the surfaces are interchangeable.  No more confusion on which is the top one and which one is the bottom one.  We love it and use it frequently.

  This was a gift for my son and we used it, fresh out of the box, for breakfast Christmas morning.  What a great machine! It handled bacon, sausage, eggs and pancakes like a breeze. At first, he was a little disconcerted because he had asked for a large griddle. But, after this, he can see the possibilities...mainly for the panini feature, ""Hey, I can do fat sandwiches without causing them to slide apart because the lid ""floats"" and presses down evenly!""  Now, I'm giving serious thought to getting one of these little beauties for myself, even though I have both a panini press and a griddle! It was a big hit.

You can easily grill up chopped veggies in a few minutes using the contact grill. I just grilled asparagus, eggplant and onion slices for lunch in five minutes as a healthy side dish. We plan to try it on fish, chicken and burgers in the future. Our first morning we used it as a full griddle for pancakes and sausages. Again, cooked great and a big time saver.- Heats up fast- Reversible grills are great for different meals (contact grill = great timesaver for veggies)- Great design, easy to clean- A little heavy but not awful.I'm extremely satisfied with this purchase and it has been worth every dollar.

FURTHER, AFTER ONLY A COUPLE OF WEEKS THE COILS NO LONGER HEAT TO THE APPROPRIATE TEMPERATURE.  I purchased this after being lured by the infomercial.  I thought the quality looked good.  It's not.

  My Griddler is awesome!  I've grilled veggies -- eggplant, zucchini, onions, tomatoes and lots more with great results.  I get the best charring when I cook on sear heat.  I was amazed at the results with chicken thighs -- good sear and done in 7 to 8 minutes.  Paninis were perfect.  Of course an outdoor grill would be better but not allowed in my building.  This suits my love for grilled vegetables every night and clean up is a breeze.  Great product.

  well its ok and that about it. I think its worth about $50 bucks. its not well made. The design of the draining system doesn't work well.first of all  you should be able to put it on a steeper angle to help it drain out  all of the grease. The edges between the gill themselves should have a smoother  sloping transition so the grease can freely move away and drain out. its also more difficult to clean between the grill. bad engineering ! i would not buy it again. i miss my GF!

  I love this griddler! I live in an apartment, so having an outdoor grill is a no-no. I use this griddler almost every night to cook, and I love it. It's easy to use, easy to clean, and it's 100 times better than my old George Forman grill. I love the fact that I can adjust the temperature, the handle is heat resistant (so I can touch it without fear of being burned!), and that clean up is a snap. I don't have a dishwasher, so hand washing is my only option. Food comes off the grill plates very easily with hot water, a sponge, and some dish soap. Nothing fancy or labor intensive about it. Although it may be a little small for a family, for a couple or a single person, it's perfect. Love it!

  Having done my research on grills/griddles before purchasing this item, I really thought that this was the clear winner.  It arrived in no time and I was ready to grill, it heats up quickly, and I highly recommend following the cooking recommendations since it is very easy to overcook your food with this unit.  I have a few complaints, first off the lip on the surface is not very high and fat and grease, or moisture of any sort bubble and splash all over the counter from all sides of the unit, secondly the unit is not on a slant so the fat just sits around your food and kind of marinates the now lean meat in fat.  To try and solve this problem, I rest the back feet on a cutting board, but the liquid seems to just spill over the front of the unit rather than into the receptacle off to one side.  After a few uses I have gotten the settings down apt and food cooks evenly and quickly, clean up is a breeze with the removable plates, if the lips was just a bit larger and if the unit was angled for proper fat run-off you'd have a real winner.  I am pretty neutral on the item, it works but makes a mess and is a little inconvenient.

",1.0,BirdLady,"Reviewed in the United States December 15, 2014","









  
  
    
  I'm very disappointed in this product.  I tried it on both the griddle and the grill and neither cooked properly.  I set the temperature for the griddle at 375° per the recipe directions.  After a couple of minutes the green light came on so I thought it was ready to cook.  I spooned on some batter and it just sat there - no sizzle.  No bubbles forming in the batter after 5 minutes and the bottom was barely starting to color.  I upped the temp to the maximum of 425°.  At that temperature, it took 10 minutes for the pancakes to cook through, but still just a light yellowish color.  The next day I decided to try the grill.  I had some marinated boned chicken thighs as a test.  I set the temp to sear which is the maximum temp.  The green ready light came on after about 8 minutes.  I added the chicken and there was a bit of sizzle.  The chicken did cook in about 5 minutes, but it was more a steam cook even though I had thoroughly drained and toweled off the marinade.  There were some grill marks, but not as much as I would have expected or liked.  In addition, even though there was very little fat on the chicken, a small amount of the fat escaped into the bottom of the unit instead of the fat tray.  I'm sure that cooking a steak would not have been successful either in cooking or collecting the fat.  I bought the Griddler as an upgrade from my old George Foreman grill and the Griddler doesn't come close to cooking as hot or as well.  I am returning the product.

  I've used this several times per week for the last 6 months. I cook primarily fish and chicken on it, though occasionally some veggies. The nonstick coating on one plate is now bubbling and coming off, despite being very careful with my cleaning, with using nonstick spray, and with trying to maintain the unit.I've also had problems since day one with the grease drainage. The grill plates don't have an angle to them, so grease can just sit until it accumulates enough to dribble off the back where the notch is. It's not really a good design, and it results in a fair amount of grease and spray on the unit and counter, rather than in the tray that's made for it. I've never had a contact grill with this much grease ending up outside the tray no matter what I do.My unit is easily within warranty, but return shipping or just buying new plates doesn't make sense to me, especially with the grease issue. I'm now just going to go buy a better grill from someone else. I used to use a Hamilton Beach grill with removable plates which was great and lasted for years, but unfortunately the cover cracked and the model is discontinued. We'll see what I can find... hopefully something that also has a timer while I'm at it.Anyway, I bought this for mid double-digits, and 1/2 what Amazon is selling it for as I write this. And I look back and just say I should have bought something else. The high reviews and ranking aren't justified. This might be okay for someone just occasionally grilling vegetables or panini, but it really doesn't seem well-suited for regular use, and especially not for things like meats that actually put out fat/grease.This product is reviewed way too highly. And unless you're ready to cough up return shipping when the plates fail... don't hold your breath on the warranty being worth anything, practically speaking. I can't recommend this for regular use.

  I love our griddler but was disappointed when after only 2 months and 4 to 5 uses a grill plate release button broke. Cuisinart was quick to replace but at my expense to ship back the old one ($16). Then we received the new replacement and one of the grill plates had a small crack. Fortunately, I was able to switch out a grill plate from the old griddler.If I didn't love my griddler so much, I would have given it 3 stars. Hence the 4 stars. It is easy to use and to clean. Meats, veggies and sandwiches are cooked quickly and have nice flavor. The only time I experienced the splattering problem mentioned by others was when cooking another round of meats without cleaning off the grill plates. The griddler has become a must have in our house.To exhaust the limited smoke the griddler creates, I place it on the stove top under the vent. This helps with the clean up too - wipe grill plates, outside of the unit and a few spots on the stove surface. Dinner's done!

If you can live with that, you can otherwise trust the manufacturer's claims about what it does.

",4.0,M. Copeland,"Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2013","









  
  
    
  So why's it nice, well the dual cook tops allow for a variety of cooking options, as a grill, a griddle, a combo grill+griddle.  The cooking surface is quiet large, easily cooks 4 burgers or 4 chicken breasts.  As will all dual sided grills, you'll need to make sure the items are equal height, otherwise uneven cooking will occur.  What about the but, you ask?  Well, getting the waffle plates for this product is nearly impossible.  Currently they're back ordered from Cuisinart until May, or you can buy them from Amazon at a HUGE markup.  So that's where the -1 star comes from, the lack of add on parts.  Also, models in the store have a different plate design, so I'd wonder about this becoming discontinued.

  Recently purchased this product - have been using it for a few weeks and have been very pleased.  It is very well constructed, has a very nice appearance, and, so far, has worked beautifully.  I particularly like the ease with which the cooking surfaces can be removed for cleaning -  once removed they clean effortlessy - the non-stick surface performs perfectly.  Temperature controls for either griddling or grilling, the ability to open the unit to a flat cooking surface, and an enclosed drip tray, are also very nice features. Cannot think of anything that I would change on this product - very happy.

It also fits perfectly on the counter. The only flaw I see is the drip tray doesn't always catch the drips off the top but the results are so delicious, who cares!!

    Griddler
  
",5.0,Dennis Chelgren,"Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2014","









  
  
    
  We really have come to like the Griddler for sandwiches. The one thing we have learned is the bread used needs to be somewhat heavier, lighter breads flatten out way to much. Lean meats cook up quite nicely but higher fat content meats, although they cook ok, tend to splatter grease out of the edge making quite a mess on the counter. We stick to the leaner meats and avoid the mess plus it is healthier! It is also great for pancakes. You can flip the lid so it lays flat also and get done cooking quicker using both sides at the same time.

Its also great for making grilled cheese or panini sandwich. Clean up in a breeze, all you have to do is unclip the grilling platform and throw it in the dishwasher.

  So far, I have done burgers, turkey burgers, chicken sausages, pancakes, paninis, and veggies on this and it has done all pretty well. Need to get used to the temperature a bit as others have said, but it has cooked everything I have asked it to. Clean up is pretty easy, but I always wash the plates by hand to protect the non-stick surface. Super fatty foods, or foods that give off lots of moisture when cooking should be watched as the drip tray is not real suitable for excess amounts of runoff. Also, there are white spots on my griddle and grill plates that I can't get off, but not real concerned. Doesn't affect anything.

  I saw an ad for this in a magazine, and used the QR code to visit the website and learn more. It's either hot & humid or cold & yucky where we live, so we don't do as much grilling as I'm used to from growing up in Southern California. I had one of the original George Foreman grills from YEARS ago, but it was a pain to clean so I stopped using it. I was debating another GF grill, since they now have models with interchangeable plates.Then I saw that ad for the Griddler. I read the reviews on amazon as well as other sites. I LOVED the fact that the plates could be washed in the dishwasher. I knew Cuisinart was getting a really good reputation for quality kitchen appliances. Finally, Amazon had the best price by $20. Done!Yes, the plates really do wash up well in the dishwasher--they can also be handwashed. I've done both several times. It's incredibly easy to switch out the plates--grill ribs on one side, flat griddle (with rim so no spillage) on the other. I also purchased the waffle plates, and they made great Belgian waffles--much easier than with my Oster spinning waffler.Flip the center switch to choose the grill or griddle function (the manual explains what to use for cooking different items), and its light turns red so you know it's on. The coils under the plates begin heating. Flip the dial for either the grill or griddle feature  (whichever one you put the center switch on) to the temperature you want. I wasn't used to using degrees for temperature on a griddle, but it's easy to play with it and see what works best. When it's heated to your desired temperature, a green light on that switch will light.Using the grill plates: I made hamburgers and my daughter made a panini. We used top & bottom at the same time, as for paninis (made the hamburgers grill more quickly--no need to turn them).Using the griddle plates: We've made several grilled cheese sandwiches. Be sure to open the Griddler to the flat position (there's a little button on the side), so that you get the ""floating hinge"" effect and don't squash your sandwich.Using it flat: I used it flat to cook eggs--it worked really well.One nice thing you can do is, when your food is almost ready, just turn the middle switch to OFF, and let the residual heat finish cooking your food. Then you don't have to worry about leaving it on too long.I am surprised some people had problems with the drip tray. It tucks underneath in an angled manner (sounds weird--you'll understand when you see it). Mine contained all of the hamburger grease really well--no mess on my kitchen counter. I love that it tucks away flatly--I'm just afraid I'll forget to check it and get rid of the grease because it's so unnoticeable! :DGet. Enjoy. Love! If you get a lemon (because lemons happen!), just return it for a new one, because this is a very well-made product.

  My husband and I ordered this grill a few weeks ago to help us have easy options for cooking in our small apartment.  We LOVE it!  We can grill a couple of thawed chicken breasts (using the contact grill function) in seven minutes!  And I've had a grilled cheese every day this week for lunch.  We've also cooked pancakes, flank steak, and plenty else.  My husband is impressed that the grill cooks so evenly, and I am thrilled that the plates are so easy to clean!  We were totally prepared to use the dishwasher and even let them get a little yucky, but replace them in a year or two, but after probably 20 uses, they are still brand new looking with hardly any scraping or scrubbing!  Our only complaint is that most of our cooking juices don't seem to travel to the small hole in the back of the grill to drain into the drip tray.  We're not totally convinced that this isn't because our counter is uneven, though.

    Not up to Cuisinart quality; Customer Service non-existent
  
",3.0,Fat Old Dad,"Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2011","









  
  
    
  I own several Cuisinart products and have been pleased with them. However, the Griddler is definitely a product that probably should not bear the Cuisinart name.Cons:1) The 2nd or 3rd time I used the Griddler I set the Grill/Panini knob to High and turned the selector switch to Grill/Panini to pre-heat the unit. After several minutes I checked the unit and the ready light on the Griddle knob (not the Grill knob) was lit. Since I had not used the unit as a griddle yet, the Griddle knob was turned to lowest setting (200 degrees) so this is what the Griddler pre-heated to. So even though I had the selector switched to Grill/Panini, the heat had to be controlled by the Griddle knob. Although this knob/selector issue only happened that one time it indicates a problem which could be of concern (what if the opposite occurred; thinking I was pre-heating to 200 degrees but instead it heated to ""SEAR"").2) I contacted Customer Service regarding the above and NEVER got a response back from them.3) Today I used the unit as a griddle for the first time and set the knob to 350 degrees. I started off cooking some Butterball turkey bacon (which is very thin and cooks fairly quickly) on both halves of the griddle. All was going well and after removing the bacon from one side of the unit I ladled out pancake batter on that side. I removed the bacon from the other half and put more bacon on. After a couple minutes I noticed the pancakes were not ""bubbling"" and the bacon was not sizzling. I touched my finger quickly to one of the plates (like you would to test an iron) and it felt warm to almost hot. When I turned the Griddle knob down the indicator light relit at almost 200 degrees. I ended up having to turn off the Selector switch and then turn it back on with the Griddle knob turned to 400 degrees to get it to start heating back up. Definitely an issue with the knobs and temperature control.4) As at least one other reviewer has mentioned, for paninis, the top self-adjusts but only after it has contacted the food with enough pressure to release the top from its' detents. What this results in is the top slice of bread (and whatever layers of ingredients you have) being pushed forward. So you essentially end up with a ""leaning tower of panini."" I overcome this by using an oven-mitted hand (yes, the top does get very hot) to situate the top parallel to the bread as I close the cover. Even then the top still has lateral motion and will result in a slightly skewed sandwich.5) The drainage lips do not line up well with the drip tray. Thankfully I have not cooked any fatty/greasy foods but have ended up with puddles of poultry juices on the counter top.6) It may seem petty but maybe some sort of indicator light when the drip tray has liquid in it. When you are cooking something and it is done, you usually turn off the unit and leave to serve/eat the food. Several times I have gone to move the unit after it has been off for a while only to spill the entire contents of the tray. Luckily, as I mentioned above, my tray has pretty much only contained poultry juices which is easier to clean up than a puddle of molten, or even slightly congealed, fat. An indicator light that stays lit until the drip tray is emptied would be a nice reminder.7) The top does get very hot. Why couldn't the unit have been constructed with a double hull or some sort of liner? Hey, I would rather have a layer of asbestos paper sandwiched (no pun intended) between a double metal shell than burns/welts on my fingers from incidental contact. You definitely don't want the Griddler anywhere within a child's reach.8) The knobs/dials are very flimsy and do not feel like quality parts. Cheaps parts used for temperature control are going to fail quicker than quality parts; cheap moving parts are going to fail quicker than quality parts.Pros:1) I love, love, love sandwiches and it is nice that I can thin slice some chicken breast and toss it and some veggies onto the grill surface, close the top and minutes later remove the chicken and veggies, place them on bread with some cheese, close the top and several more minutes later have a decent chicken and veggie hot sandwich. I am not much of a red meat eater but will eventually try this for hamburgers.2) I cooked marinated chicken breast for 3 or 4 days in a row. I did not bother to clean the plates each time (sort of like coffee lovers who do not wash their cups) but instead just did a quick scrape with the included tool and days later when I looked at the plates I thought they would never be clean again. The grill scraper and a spray of hot water took care of the burnt on marinades in less than a minute. Most time I don't even need to wash the plates, but just wipe them with a cloth.3) The plates cool down very quickly once the unit is shut off (which is really no surprise considering there is absolutely no insulation anywhere near the plates/heating elements).4) Although the plates are very light and seem to be very fragile (they honestly feel like they could snap in your hands) they are in fact quite durable.5) The plate clips hold the plates very well and the release buttons work like a charm. I really have to question other reviewers claims that the clips have melted, my clips are made from heat resistant plastic, very similar to if not the same as the scraper. My clips do not show even the slightest hint of heat damage/melting.6) Anyone who has read my review of the ""Pizzazz"" will know I like using products for multiple purposes. I have used the griddle plates to heat a bunch of shrimp poppers (dumped half the bag out onto the plate, evened them out and closed the top. Shortly afterwards I had hot, slightly charred, crispy poppers. The same can be done with fish fillets as there seems to be enough space when using the griddle plates to cook the fish but not flatten them out. I was out of bread so I opened a tube of crescent rolls but left them flat. Placed them on the griddle plate and closed the cover. Minutes later I had golden brown crescent ""bread"" which I then used to make a couple panini sandwiches.Comments:1) Paninis are just another stupid craze everyone seems to have to be in on. I have a sandwich maker but that tends to make more of a sealed (pocket) sandwich. The Griddler does a nice job of heating/toasting sandwiches, with or without grill marks.2) The Griddler could just have easily been developed with only one knob. I am very sure that setting the Selector at Griddle and the knob at 350-400 degrees is absolutely no different than setting the Selector to Grill-Panini and the knob to High. It is just more parts that are subject to fail and create a potential hazard. C'mon, how many people are going to want PRECISE temperature control with a product like this. We don't need a dial that can be set to between 275-300 degrees. Cuisinart could have used a quality detent dial; Off, 200/Warm, 250/Low, 300/Med, 350/Med-Hi, 400/High, 450/Sear. In fact, if you look at the Griddle knob you will see the dial is linear (50 degree major increments, 25 degree minor increments) until you get to the highest settings which changes to a major increment of 25 degrees (12.5 minor). Since a linear potentiometer should not suddenly go non-linear, the degree markings on the face of the Griddler pretty much mean nothing. Maybe someday I will test the settings against actual temperature. What would have been nice is a dial to allow only one side to be turned on so you are not heating up both plates when only one is going to be used.3) The top could have been designed so the top stays parallel and comes down on the food at a more vertical angle.Cuisinart should go back and rethink this one. I have used mine quite a bit but don't like the little quirks, especially the uncertainty of when the unit is going to ""think"" it is griddling when I have set it to grilling. Guess what, if you set the Selector to Griddle but flip the plates over you are now grilling. Having 3 cheap dials serving the purpose of one quality dial (or two if you add the ability to turn off one side) is stupid and wasteful.Add some insulation, make the side plate clips out of a material that is resistant to EXTREME heat so no one can complain the clips melted, and, dammit, answer consumer queries/complaints/feedback.

It works very well, it is very easy to use, it comes with a menu of suggestions on a variety of paninis and because of the detachable plates, it is extremely easy to clean.I found the price point very reasonable too.  It was cheaper on Amazon than at the store.  Overall a very good product.

  My family enjoys the variety of cooking they can do with this.  It can be washed in dishwasher and cleans easily.

  Just got this about a week ago and we've already made Reuben sandwiches, pork chops, and fried up some Spam on it.  Easy to clean with the removable plates.  Very easy to use - - similar to the dials on our oven.  Grease catcher works very well and, again, easy to clean.  Just ordered the waffle plates directly from Cuisinart even though the site said it has an estimated shipping date of May.  It'll be worth the wait since they only charge $39.99 for the set.

  I use this thing all the time. I will however say I am not a fan of the way the top comes down. It tends to slide stuff forward. When making sandwiches this sucks. When I want to flatten the top so it comes down evenly, I have to wear an oven mitt. Overall however its great.

    This is not the Cuisinart that once deserved five stars

  It simply cannot maintain heat levels - a grilled sandwich is just not ""grilled"" - and I have tried preheating it on several settings and still no success so save your $$$ - I have been a Cuisinart fan for years but no more

  This thing is great. We replaced an old George Forman grill with this and glad we did! Removable griddles are amazing, lays out flat if needed, heats perfectly. Very happy with this and have used it a lot.

  Used it the day I received it to grill a New York strip steak.  4 minutes and perfectly medium rare.  Used it to make a panini for lunch the following day. Once again, beautifully and quickly grilled.Cleanup up exceptionally easy.Haven't used it as a griddle or in the open position yet but I'm sure it will perform well.For those who broke the handle, there's enough weight to press a panini without forcing the lid down. Panini's are not meant to be totally squashed.
