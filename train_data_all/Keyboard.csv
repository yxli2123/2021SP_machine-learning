    Would recommend!
  
",5.0,Megan Dugas,"Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2018","









  
  
    
  So far so good! This was purchased as an early Christmas gift. The enter key and space bar design make for a very comfortable gaming keyboard. The keyboard itself has a matte finish over the keys, making them comfortable and easy to use. The extra keys are super nice as well, one of them along the top will open your My Computer folder with just the touch of a button, its function keys are akin to almost having a laptop keyboard for your desktop, allowing for easy access to things just from your keyboard, rather than needing to constantly adjust your speakers to your computer, or vice versa. The mouse is a little bulkier than we are used to, but it has good response times and the buttons are springy and respond well on both keyboard and mouse. Overall would recommend as a good budget gaming mouse/keyboard combo.

    Great Rainbow LED keyboard and mouse set

   I love the color setup on the keyboard and how you can choose to turn it off, on, and ""breathing mode"" where it phases in and out.  the colors are preset and do not change on the keyboard.  The mouse does change colors but from what I can tell there is no option to pick 1 color and stay on it.  I'll be setting this set up on my daughter's gaming pc which I feel will help her because she lights to play without the overhead lights on and the LED lighting on the keyboard really helps you see the keyboard in the dark.  I had recorded a video of the mouse color patterns too but it seems we can only upload one video per review.

    Great keyboard for the price
  
",5.0,Sandy Narrington,"Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2021","









  
  
    
  It has been 9 months and I can't say much about how good the mouse is because my husband only used it for a couple of months and didn't like the feel of it so he got a new one.  It worked good but while playing COD he hit the side left button by mistake too often.  He loves the keyboard and it is still working great but the W paint has rubbed off because that's his run button.  It still works perfect but we are remodeling our house, he built a new desk and he got a new keyboard(same one but without the mouse).  He will use this one as a back up.

    Switching from Controller to this was a Great Decision!
  
",5.0,Max P.,"Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  So I recently switched to PC from PS4 for gaming. I play FPS, in particular Warzone.I used to play on keyboard back on counterstrike 1.6 days... so it’s been a while. The keys are very responsive. It only has one pattern of rgb but it can go bright or dimmer with breathing pattern options.I can’t say it is all coincidental, but I went from 1 win every other day to getting like 3 wins a day in warzone. The mouse quick change in dpi really helps with steadying snipes or snapping turns to 360 an opponent that catches you off guard.

    Cheap, but decent
  
",4.0,Torrence Meister,"Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2019","









  
  
    
  For the price, I'd call it a decent keyboard, but it doesn't appear to have any macro capability, which in my own book leaves it unfit for a gaming keyboard - I always need that one 'click at top speed' macro for the games that insist on rapid clicking for normal play.  Still, the keyboard has the pretty lights, buttons to control PC volume, and the keys are quiet (no clicky noises).  The extended front looks like it's trying to function as a wrist rest, which I personally feel falls short of the mark in the worst possible way... but it's probably a 'your mileage may vary' thing.  Some people may well like the extended front, but that very feature may force me to replace it with a keyboard that I can use a proper wrist rest with.Oh right, it ships with a mouse too.  It's no trackball so I've stashed it in a drawer for the fateful day my regular mouse breaks... lets give that a quick look.  Snazzy art design . . . decently bright light if I plug it in...  the mouse wheel does not support left/right motions, but most people don't use that mousewheel function even when it's present... and the blinking the mouse doeswhen I change DPI settings would be an issue in an unlit room (epileptic seizures being things that like triggering from blinking lights)... half the point of having a glowing keyboard/mouse being to use them in an unlit room, I could see that actually being a problem for some users.  But the combo mouse/keyboard still looks snazzy, and for some it's the looks that matter.

   The kb has good action and fairly standard placement of keys, though I often hit the volume down key when I mean to press Ctrl.You will notice 2 things from the picture: The keys wear out from natural oils on the skin, food oils, and frictions.  There should be some protective coating.The caps lock is missing.  I always remove Caps  Lock because it is annoying that it activates so easily - it should be a multi-key toggle or a real switch.  The insert/ overwrite mode can also easily ruin a writing session,  but these are problems endemic to ALL keyboards. Pardon my rant.Turn the lights off, put stickers on the keys and it's a decent kb though.The lighting is bright enough, but these tired old eyes could use larger symbolsThe sequencing has a few presets and adjustments for timing and brightness.I have an older Letton which looks exactly the same (with more worn out letters) that has a more pleasant sequencing for the kb and mouse.Wouldn't it be great if there were a cross platform Python interface to control the lighting sequence?Another triviality, but fun.

    Old design good, new design bad. Anything review dated before 2020 is a review for the old design!
  
",2.0,Gadgetsprime,"Reviewed in the United States December 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  First and foremost, they changed the design, most of the reviews you see here that are positive are older reviews from 2019, when they had an actually good design. So, please disregard any review that came from before 2020, as they are not talking about the same mouse and keyboard you potentially will be buying.That said, onto the new design review-The mouse LOD (lift off distance) is rather high, which means if you lift your mouse off the mousepad at all, it'll still keep detecting movement even if you're half an inch off the pad. This can be extremely inconvenient as it will mess up your movement. The newer mouse design is a bit heavier then the previous design, but not too bad. Its shape is mediocre, but acceptable too. Its biggest flaw however, is definitely the LOD which can inhibit movement during gameplay so be aware of that. Perhaps it could be fixed with a little tape, but I'm not terribly sure- as is however, sensitivity of the sensor is way too strong.As for the keyboard, the design is also mediocre- Its a pretty standard keyboard design, which generally is passable but nothing great. Unfortunately, within a minute or two of typing and gameplay, my wrist started hurting and I'm unsure if it was was from the mouse or the keyboard (I'm actually inclined to think keyboard) but either the mouse or the keyboard had a design that wasn't super great for comfort/wrist health. In addition to that, the new keyboard design lacked some keys from the previous design- Which essentially played the role of the FN keys- and although the feature is now in the FN keys, it is not nearly as convenient or efficient as having the keys separate.Havit, if you're not going to go back to the old design, would you potentially consider making a separate page for the old design? I know I certainly would buy a brand new set of the old model if you were to sell it, as it was quite good and was a different design wise then other keyboards I have come across, including your newest design. Or perhaps consider making a new design that incorporates more of the old designs? (For both the keyboard and mouse, both were quite good!)To customers, I am intending to ship back the set of the 2020 version, and maybe the set will work better for you, but it doesn't quite work for me. If you do decide to buy it however, hope it works! :)

   The keyboard is super light/feels cheap. As seen in the video, bumping the keyboard hits certain keys unintentionally. Non adjustable RGB lighting, only dimming options. Bought this for my ex while on deployment, decided to give it a shot now since I'm back and cleaning out all of my old stuff, it's not worth it. You can get a steel series keyboard at Walmart for roughly the same price with more durability.

    Manufacturers warranty on mouse
  
",3.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  Hi I bought this product about 6 months ago and when I was playing with it I heard a click. I didn’t think much of it but when I got back on I saw that I couldn’t use the left mouse button wasn’t working correctly. when playing certain games reaction time and response is key but it would have a big delay to respond and made me lose a lot but I thought it was just the game until I tried other games. The same thing happened to me and I would have a large noticeable delay for everything. Then I tried to use a office mouse that is not meant for gaming... but that was completely fine and it worked well. Then I realized that the mouse button had broke. So I was wondering if we could have a replacement If not a refund or if it has a manufactures warranty?

    Pro: Best budget gaming keyboard~mouse I have seen so far. Con: The placement of the Keys
  
",4.0,fred,"Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2019","









  
  
    
  Overall 4/5, I loved the keyboard and the Mouse, but there is 1 major issue I have found so far.ConsThe first one, the biggest issue for me haha, is the position of the keys in the keyboard, the usual keyboards has from the Esc to the Ctrl key as the first keys from left to right in the keyboard. but this one has new column in there with the controls for the music. Making you to ""learn"" again how to get used to the keyboard.  And that's really stressing for me, as all the keyboards I've used so far have the Esc~Ctrl Column as the first one. But well the pictures from the post show you how the keyboard is, but well I didn't paid attention to it, so it's my fault.Pros:- Super soft and comfortable touch for membrane keys- Comes with multimedia keys (pause/play, backward/forward, volume up/down)-- The spacebar is bigger than normal which is great for gaming and for typing- You have the option to adjust the height with two settings- The mouse feels great in my hand

    Updated Review: I've Begun To Hate It
  
",1.0,Devin,"Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2018","









  
  
    
  UPDATE: Before I start I want to say that some of my original review still holds true, however, after using this keyboard for almost a month I can't recommend it anymore.First of all, the mouse has turned out to be complete garbage and I found myself purchasing a different mouse which means the mouse that comes with this combo is a waste of space. Second, I thought I could get used to the media keys being on the left side of the keyboard but man was I wrong; even after almost a months worth of use I still hit them on accident and end up changing a song I liked half way through. Third, the backlighting has already started to become significantly dimmer and barely works anymore, especially on keys that are shades of purple or red. Lastly, and my biggest complaint is the keyboard is that it doesn't have a dedicated mute button which at first I thought was alright but when I need to hear something quickly turns out to be a gigantic inconvenience.Overall I am still very impressed by certain parts of this keyboard but again the mouse is useless and the practicality of it is just lacking too much to be worth the purchase at this point.I was unsure about this keyboard and mouse at first because it was relatively cheap especially for a combo that included backlighting. After reading the reviews though I decided to give it a try since what's the worst that can happen when you order something that's Prime? Not only did the keyboard far exceed any and all expectations but the mouse is large (although a little light) and works really well!One of the bigger complaints I had read about was the fact that the lettering on the keys wasn't transparent so the backlighting didn't show through the keys. I personally was fine with this but when I received the keyboard to my pleasant surprise the lettering was transparent and after watching some older YouTube videos on the keyboard it looks like they improved their design and made the keys transparent!Another complaint people have is the fact that the media keys are located on the left of the keyboard. While I do agree that it takes some getting used to I can see why it was done this way; it makes it so when your fingers are on WASD you can easily have access to these keys. For some people they may find it annoying but I think it really depends on personal preference and how much music you listen to while gaming (those who listen to a lot of music will love this keyboard even more)There were a couple pleasant surprises when I got this keyboard that I just wasn't expecting from such an affordable keyboard that I just had to share. First of all, the feet on the bottom that allow the keyboard to be angled up or down include TWO separate feet allowing more than just two angles to the keyboard. Second, I was expecting that the backlighting wasn't going to have any special features because that kind of thing is relatively expensive but it actually has a few modes (though nothing fancy). Lastly, as some of the reviews mentioned it doesn't have a mute button, however, on my model it has one (Fn+F4) the only problem with this is that it's a function key so it makes it a little difficult to mute things while playing.Overall there's things that could be improved upon but for the most part they've made a quality item at a very good price. It includes more than you think it would and gives your setup a more custom look without having to break the bank!

  Ugghhh! 2nd time writing this review! I just wrote a whole bunch of stuff, mis-keyed something and the keyboard took me out of this review. No I am having to re-type this! I took off more stars. I am now fed up with this keyboard.  Let me try again. I bought this because the keyboard I had for years stopped working and I wanted one where I could see the keys in a darkened room. The price was right. I didn't want to spend $50.00 or more for a keyboard. You would think that a keyboard with all these garish lights, you would be able to change it to a dim, plain white light. Apparently not! After plugging in the keyboard and looking for a way to get a solid white light or at least a single color, I opened the instruction manual and looked through all 2 pages off relevant information. I didn't need the mouse info, no multiple languages. I looked for a driver /software disc.there is not one included in the box. I looked for a download on the mfg website. Nothing. I looked over the manual again to see if I missed something. I didn't but there are a lot of things that are left unexplained.  They mention something about ""lasting mode"" but do not explain what that means. The same with ""breathing mode"" What the heck is that supposed to mean? It also says ""WASD can be exchanged with (up arrow, down arrow, left and right arrow)"". What does ""WASD"" mean, what is the purpose of exchanging it with arrows and why would you want to do that? Then it mentions 19 antighosting keys. What are ghosting keys? What are anti-ghosting keys? What is ghosting anyway? Why is this mentioned but not explained? Also, on the keyboard itself, the keys that have multiple characters, they are side by side on the key cap instead of up and down so you have to constantly guess which character is normal and which is shifted. Also they tops of the keys are too far above the keyboard making it difficult to touch type without hitting multiple keys. You also have to look at the keys that you are typing so your fingers don't hit two keys at once, usually side by side. You have to use a bit more force to depress the keys and this makes for a louder keyboard. It is not very easy to use. I used the keyboard for a week. My productivity went down, my error rate went up, It's been mentioned that I should type quieter. Also, so many comments of ""where did you get that ugly keyboard?"" Yeah, this thing is going back. I'll try to find a normal logitech keyboard that has a solid white light. This one has too many flaws.

  Only good thing about this keyboard is that it looks really awesome. Design level I will say is on point.However, get a different keyboard and probably a different brand.I've been experiencing progressively worst disconnection on both my mouse and keyboard. It started with the mouse and was occasional and they keyboard at this point is almost non-usable. Have been using it for a little over a month.The mouse will also occasionally turn on despite the computer being off if you have a cat that likes to bap at things.The colors are set on the keyboard and the mouse changes on it's own. You can't change the colors yourself.Overall, it fails at it's basic functionality.There is no phone number you can contact you can only submit a form or email.Will update if they are responsive to that.

  I used this for months. So far it's great but I am not a gamer. As a student, writing papers at night the RGB helped a ton. I like the option to turn off the lights in the mouse (which get distracting). It's not ergonomic though. The numeric pad got in my way so I had to change keybards, but it's a great tool and was very dependable. NOTE: I found the keys to be a little too far apart causing me to type slower than with my Logitech. I assume it's because it does feel more masculine- made for bigger fingers and hands.

  My first keyboard (a Logitech gaming keyboard) broke so I had to find a replacement. I'm glad to say that this set is much better than I expected. The keyboard backlights are beautiful and I love how ergonomic and accurate the mouse is. But wait, there's more! The keyboard is waterproof!!! You can literally dip it in a water bucket after drenching it during an intense gaming session. In addition, the mechanical keys feel expensive and they don't clack as loud as other ones I've used. It has a very fast response time and it allows me to consistently type at ~120 WPM. Overall, I would highly recommend this great-value keyboard set, and I'll definitely be buying a few more for my friends in the near future.

    Looks great but ultimately cannot recommend due to frequent drops and inconsistency
  
",2.0,Daniel Burnett,"Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this a few months ago, originally for use with my Raspberry Pi. Since then I have built a new PC, and have been using this set full time the last 2 months so figured it would be best to write a review.Here is the quick summary: This keyboard looks great, but I cannot recommend that anyone buy it as the keyboard and mouse frequently lock up during usage, making it unreliablePros (why I gave this 2 stars instead of 1):-Looks great. The keyboard has a nice multi-colour hue across the keys that looks really slick. The mouse slowly fades between a handful of colours as well. Overall, the entire set 'looks' like a gaming keyboard and mouse.-The keyboard feels nice to type on. Makes a very satisfying click when typing.Cons:-Too many DPI options for the mouse. I find myself accidentally clicking the button on the mouse and changing DPI. The only indication you have which DPI your mouse is, is based on the colour it flashes. Which is tough to remember when playing an FPS and you accidentally change DPI, and then need to cycle through the different options to figure out which one is right.-The MAIN CON: This keyboard/mouse must have some severe power issues our something, as both periodically drop/loss connection/lock up/freeze no matter which device I am using or what I am working on. For example, typing an email and all of a sudden a key will get lock (""How are you doing todddddddddddddddddday"" -> Not hyperbole). The mouse will become complete unresponsive. Mid round, all of a sudden I cannot move the pointer at all. After about 5 seconds it suddenly comes back. Happens several times a day, plugged into my PC, work laptop, and person laptop (same thing everywhere). This makes the entire set unreliable and unusable. Without this issue, I'd be totally happy with this set. Now, I am shopping for a new one.

  For a $29.99 keyboard/mouse set, this is a really good product. I was impressed pulling it out of the box because it's pretty sturdy and solid. With four settings on the keyboard lighting system I originally thought to leave it off but now I keep it fully lit because it doesn't light up the room nor cause any glares. Though with the lights off in a low lit room, the letters on the keys are not easy to see. The mouse has only two options on it's lighting system, pulsing between all colours or off... I just leave it off because I don't need to watch my mouse. Upon arrival, the mouse's left button was raised by about half a centimeter against it's case but once I pulled it out and pressed it back in it's place it was fine, that did not cause any defects.One thing I don't like about the keyboard are the media buttons being on the left side of the keyboard with full sized buttons. I tend to hit the volume down button while I'm playing a game and turn off the volume when I mean to hit Ctrl. The only reason I need to look down on my keyboard is to hit Ctrl, Shift and Tab. Hopefully I'll get used to this in time.Above all, this product is really good and well worth it. Yes I would recommend this.

  The product is basically as advertised and I haven't had any problems with functionality at all. The keys are a little bit bigger than I am used to so I am adapting to them but not completely loving them. It seems like both the size of the keys and the spacing of them causes me to miss buttons or accidentally hit wrong keys sometimes, but I figure that's more of a personal adjustment than a problem, just keep in mind while shopping. I don't find it very ergonomic for that reason. I like the rainbow lights, but of course definitely note that you cannot change it to one static color like green or white or whatever. I actually really wish you could just turn it to white because I wear really thick glasses and colors in my peripherals can sometimes split and become distracting, and that happens a littleI am still adapting to the size and placement, as I mentioned. It's just worth noting in case you're like me and would find that a little frustrating.

  I'm happy with my new keyboard. This was my first time actually buying a fancy keyboard so my opinion might not mean as much, however, I'm very happy with it for the price.As far as the keys go, I think they feel pretty nice. I'm not used to my space bar having a such spring load it it, but I'm trying to get used to it. Again, I'm not an expert so someone else may feel differently!I like the feeling of the mouse as well. The mouse has the typical left click, right click and scroll in addition to a button on top to control the light and two buttons on the left side. The buttons on the left side by default are back and forward buttons (I think they can be programmed but I haven't tested).The keyboard lights can be turned on and off with the light bulb button and the lights on the mouse can be controlled with the center (button underneath the scroll). The button basically allows you to switch and have the eagle be purple, light blue, dark blue, yellow red or green. I personally like how the lights on the bottom of the mouse transitions (I wish the keyboard could do that!).

  First off, this keyboard is really good for gaming. The mechanical keys feel really good and give excellent feedback. The LED backlighting is both non-essential and ultra-cool. My one problem - and it is a huge one - is the location of the backslash/pipe key and the ENTER key. Look closely at the screenshots, and you'll see that the backslash key is where the long part of the ENTER key is on most keyboards.  You have no idea how many times I've accidentally hit ENTER when I meant to type either a backslash or pipe. Over and over and over. I can't get over the muscle memory I have for where that backslash should be. Having part of the ENTER key there is friggin frustrating!!!

  I liked this keyboard and mouse combo so much I ordered another for my home office and one for my wife, who also loves it.  The mechanical feel is very satisfying for someone that has to do a lot of typing throughout the day and the mouse is one of the best I have ever used.  I ordered this to replace the keyboard in my home office that can get very dark from time to time (usually at night).  Some reviewer had mentioned that the keys themselves do not light up, just space in between the keys.  That is only partially true.  In a dark environment, the letters and number DO light up, at least enough so that you can read them.  Overall I am glad I switched from my wireless set to this one.

  Keyboard lights are very dim on edge keys, mouse freezes during gameplay.I missed the part of the description that discloses that the keys are not individually back-lit and was disappointed to see that the lights are solid/static and will not cycle through colors. It is all based on a central back light which causes the keys furthest from the center to be very dim. Even in a dark room I could not easily see the 1,2,3,4 keys, or the QWERT keys (most used during games).The mouse, on the other hand, is very bright and the DPI control works very well. However the thing froze often while playing WoW or Guild Wars.Also, the enter key is strange. It stretches vertically instead of horizontally like most keyboards. So I would often find myself hitting the '\' key rather than enter which was very annoying when trying to type quick messages in-game.If you want dynamic, bright lighting on a keyboard and a mouse that does not freeze, put the $ towards slightly more expensive items.

  Bought this to go with my newly built computer. Keyboard was fine for about 6 months and now all of the sudden I have keys doing weird things. I'll press the 6 key and it types 56. I press the v key and it acts as though the return key was pressed and vice versa for the return key. Not certain what to think since the keyboard is roughly 6 months old.*******An update to my previous review. I have now taken it down to one star. After again barely having this keyboard for  months, the previous issues were resolved with gently ""burping"" the board. But now after a few weeks, the left shift key and the return key do not register when pressed. Piece of junk, do not buy.

    Decent keyboard, but got wrong layout, and the people at the support email never replied
  
",2.0,NeeTroo,"Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2017","









  
  
    
  I bought this a few weeks ago looking to upgrade my Logitech keyboard. Since then I've returned this keyboard and got a mechanical one for the same price as this instead, and it's so much better. When I bought this one, shipping didn't take long, but they sent me the wrong layout. It looked like what appeared to be a UK layout (I think), meanwhile in the pictures it was in the US layout. Although it didn't matter too much, the small shift key and narrow enter key were enough to annoy me while using it. I tried messaging the support email included in a little piece of paper that came in the box, and even after a few days, they never replied. They keyboard itself was okay (it isn't a mechanical keyboard if you were wondering), it was a little mushy to type on however and the multimedia keys got very annoying as whenever I tried to press control or shift or whatever, I accidentally pressed one of the multimedia keys instead, which was happening constantly. It felt somewhat decent to type on, however like I have said before, mechanical keyboards are a lot better and you can possibly find one for the same price as this one, maybe even a little cheaper. It was made mostly out of plastic, which was expected, and didn't break while I was using it, so build quality was good. Althought, the mouse on the other hand... The mouse, while it looked really cool with the lighting, was not that great. It has some sharp points in some spots, especially near the front. The material feels kind of rubbery but it isn't and doesn't feel too great to hold. Mine seemed to be EXTREMELY sensitive as well, because when I tried to use it on my desk, the cursor started going bonkers, so I had to get a cheap mousepad in order for it to stop. After that I had no more sensitivity issues, but the mouse still felt cheap compared to the keyboard. The returning process went okay, but I'm very glad I returned it as I found something much better for the same price. If you're on an extreme budget, then maybe consider buying this, but there are better options out there for the same price, or even less than the price of this made by better companies that are more trustworthy and will reply to emails you send to them.. unlike this one.

  I was heavily dissatisfied with my purchased of this Keyboard and Mouse combo to the point where I had to request a refund. My main issues revolve around the Keyboard itself. When the keyboard was sent over it worked perfectly fine, but after a good 5-6 days issues came up with its buggy keys. Ever so often, pressing certain keys would also press another key that was not in its immediate area. (For example pressing the H key would have pressed the 8 key as well, and pressing left shift would have muted the entire computer.)The mouse was also dissatisfying, as the left click is not fully responsive, pressing it repeatedly would not register every click, leaving to many failures when gaming. Which is disheartening since its marketed toward this market.All in all, Do not buy this.

The mouse is overly sensitive and even with some tweaking, it's still super sensitive.  The is no way to control the color changing on the mouse to remain one color.  It just cycles through all the colors.  I wish there was a way to assign colors to chosen keys but you can't.  All in all, a decent keyboard for the price.

  EDIT: it’s been a couple minutes since I posted my original review, and the keyboard and mouse seem to be working again after restarting my computer. However, my keyboard and mouse have never acted up prior to purchasing the Havit keyboard and mouse set. Hopefully, this issue won’t re-emerge. I’ve still gone ahead and purchased an alternate mouse and keyboard because something about this one rubs me the wrong way...Regardless, the keyboard and mouse look great. I have no idea what’s up with the hardware though. I’d still recommend doing some research to find a reliable keyboard. I have a feeling this won’t last me much longer.Original review: I’m not one to write a poor review for a product and believe me, I REALLY wanted to like this keyboard and mouse combo...but it was just too good to be true. When I first received the package and set up the mouse and keyboard, everything worked perfectly. The keys were comfortable, the mouse felt decent, I was pleased. Now, 30 days later (so just about a month) and everything still feels great! But the keys have become unresponsive as well as the mouse. I’ve seen others have issues with this and I’m sad to say that it is no different for me. The key bindings have randomly switched up as well as the bindings for the mouse miraculously so I legitimately am unable to work. I’ve tried updating the keyboard and mouse drivers, unplugging them and plugging them back in, restarting my computer, but nothing is working. I’ll be looking into purchasing a more expensive keyboard in the future. I’d rather pay a hefty amount for a reliable keyboard than buy a cheap keyboard and mouse combo for them to break only a month later.If it looks too good to be true, it usually is. I’d advice not wasting any money on this. It’s better to just fork over $80 or so for a reliable, sturdy keyboard that’ll actually last a couple years.

  If you're a WASD gamer playing games like Destiny 2, Dying Light or Immortals go with a different keyboard because after a week or two you will find the fatal flaw of this item. It's the space bar. It has a flattened edge to allow you to work it easier but after a little use it wears the buttons inside and jams up. In most of these games space bars are typically for jumping right? And in these types of games, jumping keeps you alive so you do it constantly.  Look at the space bar picture and see the shiny spot near the top. If you're a gamer that's where your thumb is forever.  This causes the internal buttons under the space bar to get a lot more wear and tear because the space bar is no longer being pushed straight down but at an angle. Those buttons wear faster and the space bar starts jamming up and sticking. The manufacturer did not do any extensive product testing here. It becomes very apparent in a few weeks of playing. Its a 29 dollar keyboard so expect that. The mouse is very cool and seems to work fine, but the keyboard one and only flaw is a major one for gamers. Suppose to be a keyboard made for gamers....nope. Spend more...get better.REVISED: Keyboard is dead. Gone back to old Logitech which seems to never fail. Several keys on this 'Magic Eagle' no longer work at all... tab, N, Alt and a few more quit. Hope you have better luck than me.

  you're getting what you pay for. It's not a high end quality keyboard or Mouse, the mouse feels pretty okay an odd texture but you get used to it. The keyboard however is a disappointing part though I do like the layout it is beyond noisy. It's louder than my 2004 keyboard and the cap locks occasionally tends to turn on or acts as if it's on even when it's not. In all honesty opinion your best bet is just buying the mouse separately and I'm getting a cheaper or more quieter keyboard unless you will like the sound of constant thumping every time you hit the spacebar.Update (literally a hour later) the spacebar seems to either have busted itself or was prebroken. Dropping this from a 3 star to a 2

  I bought this keyboard 3 years ago as a place holder when I first built my PC and its still going strong. All the lights and keys still work the same as day one despite me beating it every time I die in a game and get trashed talked for it, which is what inspired me to write this review.The only drawbacks are that it can put your wrist at weird angle depending on your setup so I would recommend a support for your wrist if you play long hours at a time, and the keyboard cord is at least a foot shorter than the one for the mouse, which is only really a problem if you have a weird setup like myself. Also a little nit-picky but the lights turn off after a few minutes of non-use, which is fine, but when it's dark and you don't know key placements cause I didn't take typing class seriously it's just an inconvenience when you start typing. That might be a setting, but I don't read instructions.And regarding the mouse, it too has stood up rather well aside from within the past year the wheel will sometimes scroll opposite if my DPI is high enough. But overall a solid starter or casual kit.

The keyboard needs more stiffining it flexs, and with as large as it is , the amount of shear Force one can apply is cause for concern.

  For the price, its a solid built product. It looks nice and the quality isnt bad. The reason I did not give a lower rating is because their customer support did a great job in helping me resolve an issue I had with a mouse I previously purchased, although I cannot give them a higher rating because they completely ignored me when I reached out about the keyboard. I think mine may have come defective, because I've had another keyboard of the same brand for almost a year now, with no issues. I believe this keyboard is defective because whenever I type, it either does not register, or it registers more than one keystroke. For example, if I wanted to type the number one-hundred, and the zero decides to act up, it either comes out as ""1"" or ""10000"" ...this happens across all the keys and at random. Perhaps the membrane underneath the keys is the culprit. Either way, when I reached out to customer support, I was ignored. Its been a week since I reached out, and still no answer, so unfortunately, I will be returning this product.

  I have had this keyboard and mouse for a little over a week, and I would of rather bought something else.

  I used these products for about 6 months until a bit of moisture got in the keyboard and one of the keys started phantom-pressing.  Once the ""g"" starts spamming whenever you type something, it gets to be unusable.  Overall, I had a great experience with it prior to this happening, so I'm keeping the stars lofty.  The keyboard itself feels moderately durable, heavier than your standard cheap keyboard which is nice.  The keys are also slightly heavier than a standard keyboard, which lends well to gaming.  When the keyboard is not in use for a while, it goes to ""sleep"" and turns off all of the RGB backlighting, which in some cases makes it hard to see keys when coming back.  All said, it was a good keyboard while it was still working properly.The mouse is also your standard low-cost gaming mouse.  It has additional buttons near the thumb rest (which for some reason I couldn't ever seem to get to program in any decent way, but didn't try too hard).  There didn't seem to be a software package to aid in the mouse configuration, but again it has been a while since I used these (after the keyboard quit, so did I).All said and done, you get what you pay for.  This is a decent keyboard-mouse pair for the nonchalant gamer.  If you want true customization, you may want to throw some more money at something else, probably not in a package deal with keyboard+mouse.  But if a quick and easy gaming setup is all you desire, this is a great product.

   The keyboard and mouse are both USB so they connect to your computer, that's where they receive they're power source for the lights. People seem to think they're wireless, they are NOT. After a few hours of gaming left hand hurts so you have to adjust your hand just right on the plastic under the keyboard. KEYBOARD has 4 settings, first is off no lights. Then you press Fn + Escape and it turn ons, third setting is the same as the second one but little bit more bright. And lastly the final option is for the keyboard to turn on and off by its self.  NOTE: The colors are presets so you cant change them. From left to right it goes blue, purple, red, orange, yellow, and lastly green. MOUSE has 6 colors, White, red, green, purple, blue, and yellow ( yellow is only available when you hold the button for roughly 5 seconds, until it turns on). When the mouse is off you can press the button, located below the slider for viewing web pages up and down, this turns it on and if you keep pressing it, it changes color, but turns off after a few seconds. If you hold the button about 7-8 seconds it will turn on and switch colors on it's on, which varies from light colors(listed above) and the same colors but darker.

So today I dug out an old HP keyboard that hadn't been used in almost 5 years and before that was used for a few years. It still works perfectly fine, dusty and all. It sort of discourages me from buying any more products from this company even though (as far as I am aware) the mouse is still in working order.The keyboard from this set still lights up, but the Caps Lock and Num Lock lights do NOT light up and no key registers input any more. I def got my money's worth considering how it was prob only $29.99 at the time, but I def would not buy again and will use this old HP until I can afford something from Corsair.

  I just received this after purchasing it.  I have to give it 3 stars because I hate the mouse and will not use it.  It doesn't fit in my palm, it's too big.  My fingers don't sit right on the side buttons, and as I intend to use it for gaming, that's a big problem.  The keyboard is excellent for the price and I'm quite happy with that portion of it.  If you have larger hands, you probably wont have the issue with the mouse that I have, but my hands are fairly small.  Also, the mouse has different dpi settings, but they can't be changed.  Instead, it has four predefined settings you can change between.  Even without using the mouse, I recommend this purchase.  The value of the keyboard alone makes it worth it.  It feels great when I type on it, the keys have good resistance and it has a click, but not too loud.

  The keyboard itself is actually quite up to par with others of it's caliber however, as I am typing this review, the spacebar is a bit too loud and the key switches just don't feel as satisfying as other ones. Not to mention [this is my first macro key keyboard] the macro keys being on the left threw me off as what I thought I was pressing was shift but turned out to be volume. The led display is quite nice with the rainbow colors for all you rgb enthusiasts. But that mouse... holy crap. Switched my old one back because of that deceiving thing. The side buttons are placed appropriately but my hand kept sliding off because of how unnecessarily beefy the left and right mouse buttons are. So if you got small to average hand sizes like mine, you will get a terrible mouse experience. It's a fine product, but I can't help but feel that I could've gotten better for the same price elsewhere.Update: after around 2 months of use... It breaks, no longer usable by my computer. Oh yeah the mouse still sucks.

  This set of mouse and keyboard does exactly what it's supposed to do.Granted, I don't do much gaming, but I did want a backlit keyboard for various reasons, and this delivers. The keyboard has crisp key presses, and the mouse is very precise. Both are well-illuminated, and the keyboard has multiple colors for the key illumination. I generally choose green because it's the best mix of brightness and clarity. Certain lights on the keyboard will always be blue, though, even when key backlighting is turned off... Not a problem for me, but some users might need to be aware.Best of all, the price was right. If you want a good keyboard at a good price, this is definitely worth a look.so cool

  Firstly, they say that you can change the light settings on the mouse but I never got it to change anything (there are no instructions on how to do anything). More importantly, the mouse stopped working within a week or so, I thought it worked great when it arrived but then it started to freeze up. I bought the mouse to play Minecraft and it will get stuck in one position, plus it will act as if I am holding down the left click button; meaning that I can't move AND can't stop what I am doing.I have tried switching usb ports, leaving it unplugged, changing where the mouse it and using/getting rid of a mousepad. At this point it is freezing up more and more frequently, probably every 5 minutes or less.Don't waste your money, it's a trap and is not worth the frustration.I have not had any problems with the keyboard as of yet, but I have barely used it with a different computer.

  It was a really good buy at $29.99 the week of Black Friday.  It is still well price now that the price has gone back up. It is a well constructed keyboard and mouse and should last a few years.  Bought it to replace a dying keyboard for my 9 year old son. He absolutely loved it especially the fun colors on the keyboard and the mouse changing colors.  It it has quick typing response on the keyboard keys and fast click response on the mouse.  Feel like I got a really good deal compared to the really high priced keyboards and mouse combos out there (ranging from $60-85 for the mouse and $149-180 on the keyboards)While at the Microsoft Store I checked out the ""Razer BlackWidow Chroma Mechanical Gaming Keyboard"" for $169.00 without a mouse.  Keyboard layout was exactly the same except the Havit board has 3 extra macro buttons on the top of the keyboard for Home/Email/Computer.  Quality, feeling and look ere virtually the same between the boards with really no really differences even on key response. One difference, the Havit board seems brighter on the display of colors that light up behind the keys.  Walked out of Microsoft chuckling on what a good deal I got vs what Microsoft is charging for basically the same board.  I would buy this again even at a high price.

  Works exactly how you'd hope a keyboard and mouse would work. I'm a big fan of the clicking noises that keyboards make, and this one has a nice click. It's a pretty good size, my only adjustment is that I keep hitting the \ key instead of the enter key because the enter key is a little further from the J key than usual, and I have small hands that can't reach it without moving the rest of my fingers from their proper keys.

  This keyboard is fairly comfortable to use, particularly while gaming.  I  don't know if I would want it if I were a professional gamer, but I'm an old man who is just having fun and it works well for me.I have stopped needing to compose reports so I spend far less time typing and the keyboard does an adequate job for me.All in all I think it's worth the money and effort to get used to using.

  Bought this bundle as an alternative to other brands.  Did not feel like spending $90 on a keyboard and another $50 on a mouse.  This is a great bundle that gives that look and feel of the more popular brands.I feel the mouse is the strongest piece of the two.  I love how it 'breaths' colors.  Also, the mouse includes the DPI button feature, great when in the middle of a game.  The feel of the mouse in my palm feels natural as well.Keyboard has been great as well.  Includes the keylock functions for Windows key and alt+tab.The only thing I did not like at first was the placement of the Enter key.  Shaped differently than other keyboards, but it is something you will learn to adapt to.Overall, great bundle.  No real complaints.

I won't blame the keyboards, since it might be due to the wireless antenna I have on my PC or the newly installed Nest devices and other Smart devices in my home.I wanted a low cost keyboard option (because I am frugal) and this one popped up after about a month of searching, so I pulled the trigger.I love the ergonomics and the feel of the keys and mouse.  Everything functions great.  Sometimes it doesn't capitalize a letter, so not sure if it is operator error or the keyboard.My only issue is with the symbols on the keys being hard to see.  I had 2020 vision about 10 years ago, now my eyes strain to see the ""; :"" key on the keyboard.  I plan on either swapping out the keys for white with black lettering or simply put stickers over the keys that I struggle with.But that is it ... for the price this is an incredible keyboard and mouse.  If I find white replacement keys, then I will buy this keyboard again to have as a backup.

  I got this keyboard after upgrading my desk from one layer to a top layer with a roller for the keyboard and mouse under the main desk section. I needed a smaller keyboard for this setup and didn't want to spend too much, so I went with this one as it was cheap and had good reviews. I'll focus my review more towards the keyboard rather than the mouse because the mouse was functionally normal for a gaming mouse and a good deal with the keyboard. moving on, the keyboard has great key and placement. It feels crisp when you get the key placement down and typing a few hundred words for an essay feels real good. Its also nice to game on, with the ergonomic design of the media keys. With them just left of the wasd.I loved the keyboard for about two months.Then the spacebar started sticking.As a side effect of the extra tab on the spacebar, for easier reach I guess, the spacebar will eventually start sticking and stop being very useful. Especially in games that require lots of jumping or other spacebar use.All in all the price was good for what I got but now it's time for me to upgrade.ps. still using the mouse, it is very good and smooth. including its quick-access dpi changer

  The quality of this keyboard is fine, but the tops of the keys (i.e. the part touched with fingers) is smaller than on standard keyboards, probably because the keys were made taller to allow room for lighting under the keys.  This makes the keyboard more difficult to use, and more prone to making errors, in our experience.  The nice lighting is not worth the loss in functionality, in our view.  Figuring out how to change colors is also very difficult.

    Amazing Set! My Gaming Teen LOVES it! Superb Customer Service!
  
",5.0,LeighLeiben,"Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2016","









  
  
    
  I have stalked this keyboard and mouse combo for a year on Amazon because I knew it was perfect for my nearly 13 year old son who games NON-STOP on a large, touchscreen PC.  We have purchased endless wireless keyboards, mouses, and headsets and I learned fast that when it comes to gaming....you can either waste tons of money on wireless only to get endless lag and complaints from your teens...OR you can buy wired devices that are much faster and don't need replacement every six months.I ended up paying $40.00 for this set because sadly....they ran low near Black Friday and Cyber Monday and my choice was ""wait for it to go back to $29.99 and risk losing it entirely...or suck it up and pay more to make sure you get it"".  So I paid $40 and am still just as thrilled as the $30.00 I had planned to pay.  They keyboard is large and FINALLY I cannot hear him clicking away endlessly no matter where I am in the house.  The colors are very vibrant and the mouse is really very high end with lots of options compared to higher-priced models.  My son didn't ""want"" a wired set because like all younger kids....they've lived in a wireless world their entire lives.  But since I did my research and bought a USB Hub....he's thrilled to plug all of this in (plus I bought him wired and lighted headphones/microphone awhile back that need 2 ports themselves) without actually losing 4 total ports.He says the keyboard is speedier and much easier to use for gaming as well as in-game chat.  The colors are great for him and he likes the ability to switch modes on the mouse, as well as choosing ""breathe"" to fade colors in and out or to keep the mouse one color.  He likes the DPI and Anti-Ghosting options, but is still acclimating to when and where to use them.For a Christmas Gift, this was perfect for my son because he's already been at the age for several years where he wants NOTHING but ""Steam Gift Cards"" and gives me zero ideas of what to put under the tree.  This was reasonably priced, exciting for him to open (it's the first thing he hooked up and even stopped opening gifts to do so), and actually seemed to be more of a thrill than the replacement HD TV I bought him for his bedroom (he was using a 20 year old tube TV).  I personally love the look of it and the membrane keys are nearly silent compared to any style of keyboard.  The keyboard has solid weight and wiring with no cheap attributes that make me fear it breaking after a few months.For a teen that is hard to buy for and you aren't looking to spend $200 on a single gift....this was perfect.  And although I'd have loved to get the normal price of $29.99....I don't regret snatching it up for the $39.99 price one bit.  He loves and I love it and I recommend it to anyone looking for a great gift to a gamer or just someone who loves awesome colors, speedy response, and a large/nice layout.  I absolutely recommend this set above others in the ""Under $100"" price range.  Really a fantastic purchase!****UPDATE January 20, 2017******I had a minor problem with the mouse, but the keyboard is functioning famously!  I contacted the seller and unlike many transactions, the seller responded within the hour with a solution.  They offered a replacement mouse that is ""upgraded"" without my needing to return the whole set (since I have no issue with the keyboard) and apologized for any problems with the mouse, which were minor.  My son experienced the mouse ""going off in all directions despite using directional keys"" and as soon as I contacted the seller about the issue, he/they immediately offered to send an upgraded mouse at no cost to me without the hassle of returning the mouse that isn't working properly.  The response was lightening-fast and despite only contacting the seller mere hours ago....they already responded, solved the problem, provided a code to purchase a replacement mouse (at no cost to me) and were clearly interested in my experience with the new mouse once it arrives.  This is some of the fastest and most accurate ""correction"" of a minor problem I have had on Amazon and this Seller is clearly dedicated to excellence in both service as well as functionality.  I'm more than impressed as a regular Amazon shopper in the diligence, speed, and correction to what is essentially a ""hinky"" mouse that may or may not be manufacturer defect.  They didn't question the problem with the mouse and immediately offered an upgraded mouse for free with no need for me to go through the exhausting exchange and return/refund experience.  I just contacted them with the problem and they responded, corrected the issue, and had a new mouse available to me within about 3 hours of my first contact.  This is truly excellence in customer service and pride in their products.  I cannot recommend this Seller enough in their ability and care in response, correction, and ability to provide truly awesome service.  This is a Seller that should fall into what I call ""Stellar Seller"" on Amazon.  Amazing service and quality products and they actually DO honor their guarantee without argument or lack of speed and response.  Truly and honest seller invested in their products!  As a long-time Amazon shopper....this experience is in my Top 3 for excellence and I HIGHLY recommend them for their service as being awesome, fast, and totally easy.  Thanks so much for making this Christmas Gift as great as it was when I bought it.  Truly a trusted and honest Seller.  Would recommend again and again!!*****

  I'm really glad that I finally got this after waiting! It's excellent quality and it's beautiful the light goes out into sleep mode if you're not using it and it's easy to plug in to an external Hub or into the PC. It was a great investment and it came with a matching mouse which I am not currently using at the moment. I was concerned that the lights and controls on my Mac wouldn't be triggered on this keyboard, but the keys work perfectly.  I can press volume down and up on this keyboard and I don't have to lean over to reach my Mac . I love it so much.  Just plug it into the computer or the external  Hub and then restart your computer and it should work perfectly. I want to get a second one. Probably the white pastel in the near future for my other office. I don't want to chance breaking them  by moving them around too much. It is a bit big and little heavy, but I like that.

  It's a very nice keyboard. I was surprised with it thinking it was going to feel cheap, but it actually doesn't feel cheap. It doesn't feel top quality though. More like a mid-range quality. Which I feel is good considering the price. It's laid out well, though some may not like the shape of the Enter key. The LED lights are very bright, which makes it a shame that the letters themselves are not backlit. Just behind the keys. The keys themselves feel alright. The arrow keys have a nice feel as they have a slight circular indentation. I kinda wish all the keys were like that.Overall, I'd say for the price this is a great keyboard for this price range. Not for a pro gamer, but lower end or beginner gamer or just standard users would find this a great keyboard. Better than the TeckNet Gryphon keyboard from the same price range I also recently reviewed.Edit: Forgot to note that I did not really need nor try the mouse. At a glance, it looks pretty cool and not bad. But I haven't tried it, so I can't put an opinion about it in this review.

My son said he knew that but it wasn't a big deal because none of his passwords had a ""B"" or ""M"" in it. 🙄I wasn't expecting anything extraordinary from such an inexpensive keyboard but my son didn't need the keyboard for anything other than logging in once in awhile. Having it fail after just 2 months is pretty disappointing. I sincerely hope you keep looking for other options cause this keyboard is junk.

  works great as intended. I use it for mostly work and occasional gaming and i've found it to be greatly suited to my needs. first we can start with the keyboard. I actually really enjoy the ergonomics of the keyboard compared to my old one. it is not a mechanical keyboard but the keys press down with good depth and bounce back fairly well. i have no issues typing on it and when i am playing games, it feels really comfortable. I really enjoy the fact that you can change the colors how you want it as well as change the intensity. the keyboard comes with other functional buttons like sound control which is essential. next is the mouse and it also does a good job feeling comfortable in my hand. i have no issues using the mouse while also feeling natural. colors are a nice additional touch but my only complaint is that you are not able to change the colors of the mouse, it will periodically change by itself and you do not have any control over that. the DPI on the mouse is amazing and theres a button that allows you to change the sensitivity and DPI of your mouse which is awesome because you can change it to fit your needs. also has a forward and backwards function key on the mouse which is great when you are scrolling the web. otherwise i think this is a perfect combo if you want something that works for productivity at work or for gaming.

Although theres one thing that stands out and that is the the key separation is alittle bit much compared to your standard key boards. Although with sometime you get used to it, just be aware that once you go back to a mechanical switch keyboard you're not gonna wanna go back to the membrane.But another thing that fascinated me about this keyboard was the durability and build quality. Its actually built well and I've encountered a HUGH beer spill on the keyboard and mouse. I unplugged  it, ran it under water and let it sit out upside down to dry for 2 days and it worked perfectly fine.I ended up giving it to my brother as I got new keyboards with cherry mx blues and new logitech g series and corsair mice. But again for the new beginner gamers who are looking for something at a extremely affordable price this works fine. But keep in mind their are better options out there like RedDragon for example with outemu switches which feel just like cherry mx. But again this is still a great deal!

  I am not a typist. Even though the keyboard keys light up. I find it difficult to read the keypad numbers. Also the top row of numbers on the keyboard arn't fully illuminated.The mouse has a mind of its' own, at times causing me to have to hit the space bar or even reseat the usb plug to rein in the mouse.I will look at other combos in the near future to replace what I have.

  If you play MMOs, this will not stand up to wear & tear of raiding.

  I just spiked it on the floor.  Then made sure to football spike it again a few times to make sure it was dead.  Then I threw it in the trash.  Then I washed my old keyboard in the dishwasher and blow-dried it, and am cooling down.The keys aren't very resistant to dust, and the spacebar key has a spring loaded in it, that makes it very difficult to put back in if you want to clean it the right way.  I considered dishwashing it, but didn't make it.  I just couldn't stand the spacebar key, and decided it was better if I just destroyed it.  The keys on my older keyboard, the one that comes with the stock Acer Predator Orion, are flatter and easier to type with, apparently resistant to water, and much easier to press.I also write and like to type fast, and the damn thing wasn't responsive on AWSD for gaming after limited use, and the spacebar key was the worst.  While typing, I my thumb got tired of the force needed to hit the spacebar.  During games like Division 2 when you have to hit spacebar to dodge a lot, I got dead.It's better this way.  The experience was good at first, but it had a longevity of like a month.  I'm running with flatter key keyboards instead of big button keys from now on.  I considered returning it, but throwing a tantrum and learning it a lesson was much more satisfying.

  The description is very ambiguous and ultimately, this is not what I expected nor what I wanted. I am not a gamer and I do NOT want breathing or pulsating lights on my keyboard or mouse.  While you can stop the breathing of the keyboard, you can NOT stop it on the mouse. The mouse lights are somewhat programmable through software, which by the way you have to search all over the internet to find. However, you can only slow down the breathing - Not stop it.In addition, the keyboard light can not be set to a single color - it is fixed at a rainbow spectrum, as shown in the photos.  All I want is a subtle backlight of a single color on the mouse and keyboard that doesn't pulsate or breath so I can work in a low light setting.As if that wasn't frustrating enough, the space key is loud as heck - as it springs back up, it makes a pop sound. I type fast, so it winds up sounding like a machine gun.As soon as I submit this review, I am processing a return. Instead of the name Havit, it should be HAVE HAD IT.

   We got this and hooked it up today. So far so good. Everything works as it should. My boys ages 8 & 11 bought this and thought it was the coolest thing ever! They were not disappointed. The lights on the keyboard do not change color, but the mouse does change color. You can see the difference of lighting in the video we posted.

  I've waited to write this review since I wanted to properly use this keyboard and mouse.I just want to say, its everything you really need. The keyboard feels really nice and the buttons are very smooth as well. I love the way it clicks and the anti ghosting feature makes gaming feel a lot much better.The colors on both the mouse and keyboard are pretty too! They change colors and aren't too bright to hurt your eyes in the dark but are bright enough to show under my lights.In summary, I think this was one of my better purchases and hopefully it lasts longer than the other keyboards I have tried in the past!

  Oh got where do I begin.  First I LOVE the two other Havit Keyboards I have.  Both are mechanical in style, accurate and fast.  This kit was budget oriented, so I thought I would get something like a cheap non-mechanical Logi, but instead, this keyboard is straight out of the pre-pentium era.The tall keys are SUPER mushy.  I can't even describe how bad they are.  However its nothing compared to the mouse.The buttons are bad, the response time on the mouse is WAY worse.  Literally there was 1/4ish second delay of input with this mouse.  Tried on multiple ports to no avail.  Compared to an old beat up Anker (that I love) on the same computer, it wasn't even close.  The old Anker with its worn out buttons and heavily used shell, dominated this brand new RGB mouse in literally every regard, except the Havit had a super bright rainbow RGB.The lag makes this mouse unusable for gaming or precision tasks. This isn't my first cheapo mouse, but this has been the worst.  Good luck trying to play any sort of FPS game.On top of that when you pick up the Havit mouse, it still picks up motion.  No other laser or optical mouse I have used has ever sensed movement after being picked up of the surface.  As a gamer I do this alot, and my aim literally with jump all over the place as you pick it up and reposition it, even up to about 1/2"" off the surface.  Unusable. Period.If you are buying for looks, then this kit looks great.  For the price to have something to just browse the internet, it should work fine.I stole my beat up Anker back from my wife for less than a day and she took this mouse.  First 15 mins of work she immediately asked me to buy her a new mouse or give back the Anker. She won't take the keyboard either as she despises typing on it.This is a bummer as the two other Havit Keyboards are TOP NOTCH!  I type this review now on my main rig with the Havit mechanical.  Great keyboard.  But this particular combo should be shelved.  It is bad all around.  2 stars for awesome RGB...

    Great budget keyboard, but skip the mouse
  
",4.0,Karina,"Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this keyboard a while ago after my laptop keyboard experienced a broken key. It was a very comfortable experience, and very easy to adapt to the key placements. It's got a great, responsive feel, and a pleasing aesthetic. For the $30 I spent on it, it really is a pleasing keyboard for a budget.However, I'd say the mouse is a hard pass. For one, it felt massive and chunky in my hand; like I could barely cover it. The changing colors also was surprisingly distracting; quite a few times I thought it was my phone going off due to the transition. But the most jarring issue of all, that gives me the hard pass, is that fact the mouse had a very odd tendency to stop responding for a few seconds every now and then.I have no idea why, as previous mouses have worked flawlessly before. And I tested it with every USB slot on my computer to be sure it wasn't a USB issue. But the issue persisted. Despite being fully powered, for some reason the mouse would simply not respond for those few, odd seconds.So if you're buying this combo, know that while the keyboard is quite nice for something so budget-oriented, the mouse you'll more than likely wish to replace. The mouse may not be so bad if you're one with a bigger hand size, unlike I, but if this problem of not responding is a common occurrence, it's definitely a deal-breaker.

  For the price, these are good products.  The mouse works great and has adjustable lighting.  The keyboard operates smoothly and is a great size for someone with larger hands like I have.  The only issue I have with it is either the lighting on the keyboard is a bit dim, or the letters on it aren't large enough to really see.  Also, I was under the impression that the keyboard could be adjusted to different colors.  This is true of the mouse, but NOT the keyboard.  The keyboard only has the rainbow color shown available in bright/dim/pulse settings.

   The combo set was nicely packaged and the first look I am impressed. The keyboard and mouse both are well built. Before I had a mechanical gaming keyboard but this one is way quieter The backlights on the keyboard so beautiful, and you can change different types of colors and patterns.  The set came with instruction manual which shows how to program the keyboard colors.Also, the mouse is beautiful and you can control the DPI from the top white button located on the mouse. I have an expensive Logitech gaming mouse but surprisingly this cheaper  mouse gives me similar scores in battlefield 5 online.  This is a good option to give as a gift and it looks.  The only cons I think of it is mouse size may be suitable for some and for others they need to adjust it.

  The keys feel nice, and the lighting is cool. Just a disclaimer, the rainbow light does not rotate, and there is no setting to change the keyboard to a solid color. I am using this as a temporary keyboard and I am pleased, But if you want something that changes color, look for something that says RGB.the mouse feels really nice, and I will probably keep the mouse as long as possible since I don't need more than 6 buttons at the moment. the mouse rotates through colors, but there's not a way to stop it on a certain color (at least not that I'm aware of).

  Originally purchased in October 2018. It's January 2020 now and the keyboard and mouse are still going strong. I leave my computer on for weeks at time and lights on both items are still just as bright. Only issue is the kickstand on the back of the keyboard is broken on one side but that's usually the first thing to go anyway. All in all it was a great buy.Update: September 2020It finally happened, my keyboard died. I spilled a little bit of tea on it which got between the keys. Cleaned what I could and called it a night. The next day some of the keys weren't working correctly so I opened the keyboard up to see if I could troubleshoot it further.  Since it's spillproof I thought it would be ok but nope. The drainage holes didn't do much of anything and liquid was in the LCD lights and key press circuit thingy. Functionality got worse after cleaning it further and putting it back together. Hoping I can still find a way to fix it but for now it's unusable.

  My keyboard's spacebar was broken, just to the point of being annoying. My mouse finally stopped working after a long time. So I decided to just replace them both.I need a keyboard where the buttons are raised and spaced out nicely. I hate flat keys and thin keyboards. This does the job perfectly.It feels nice and precise and the colors are pretty cool too. One review pointed out that there's an extra key between the quotation button and enter button and it can be kind of annoying since most keyboards don't have that. It is true it can be annoying, especially since the enter button seems to be smaller because of it, but I've already gotten used to it after about a week.The mouse is nice, but it's a little long for me. I like the bottom of my palm to be resting on my desk and with this mouse, my whole hand fits on it. Not a big deal, just an observation that might drive some people a little crazy.Overall I am pleased with this purchase, especially given the quality of both mouse and keyboard for a low price.

    Super fun wired rainbow keyboard and mouse combo!
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  Here are my priorities for a keyboard and mouse combo:* Mechanical.  The little slim keys that you can't even feel moving are too new-age for me.* Sturdy.  As in, I will beat this poor thing up within an inch of its life, it needs to be durable.* Wireless.  Fail, not due to the product, but due to my reading comprehension.  Bright side (ha!) that means no battery changes and endless rainbows of color.  Worth it.* Able to be tilted, not just flat for easier typing.* Not cost a small - or large - fortune.* Lights can be on or off, because sometimes the world needs to be a little darker.This set hits all but one of the above.  It's a festive bright rainbow of colors lurking beneath a black keyboard.  I love that the light shines through the letters.The mouse has a rainbow of color moving along the back edge, with the mouse roller pulsing colors also.  You can push the button to temporarily change the color, which changes the color of the mouse roller and eagle on the back to match.Both plugged into the back of my system with USB cords, and were recognized quickly.  They're responsive to my typing or mousing, and work well for the tasks needed.  (Primarily online nonsense, I'm not a gamer, but ooooh, rainbows!)

",2.0,Charles Ross Evitch,"Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2021","









  
  
    
  I have purchased 2 of these. The bad? Both of them stopped working due to some construction issues with where the cord is attached to the keyboard. I found myself having to adjust/align the cord to regain functionality. Eventually it got so bad that replacement was necessary.I also preferred the older version of this keyboard, where the volume buttons were on the left edge of the keyboard. I could be gaming and adjust the volume up or down with my left hand.  The new keyboard requires both hands to adjust the volume- by holding down the FN button with the right hand while adjusting the volume with the F2 & F3 buttons with the left hand.  I don't like this.  When gaming, i sometimes have to quick adjust in the middle of action. Prefer to have the simpler, quicker method of having separate volume buttons.Overall I liked the keyboard, but i just don't think i can invest in another one of these, despite the affordable price. I can't even get a full year of use out of them, and I am not even a heavy gamer. I'm a moderate user at best, with 95% of my usage coming from typing for work & on the internet.

  It's a decent keyboard, definitely an upgrade from what i was using. Was very easy to start using this keyboard, as there's often a discomfort with a new keyboard, getting comfortable with new spacing and everything, but i found that wasn't an issue with this keyboard. I was immediately comfortable using it.However, bc of how the keys are set up, and I'm not one to likes to smash my keys, i just find it doesn't always recognize, immediately, what I'm wanting it to do. This happens most often with the space bar when I'm trying to jump, i find my thumb having to work harder than it usually does to make sure a double jump gets registered.Overall, if you're looking for a cheap keyboard that's good for gaming, this might suit your needs. If you can spare extra coin, though... I would recommend spending extra coin.

  For the price, I really can't see how you can get a better keyboard than this! Not to mention the mouse... The mouse is the coolest feature for me because it pulsates between colors. I wish the keyboard would, but I think that might be a design thing.When you're looking at the keyboard, the blue side is mainly for your left hand, red side right hand. Green side numbers on the side. Then in between those colors are a small amount of purple, yellow, orange. It looks cool for sure.I like the feel of the keys too! I'm usually more of a fan of smaller keys so you can type faster, but this doesn't seem to slow me down much.

  This is a cheap keyboard without any junk I needed to install.

This is exactly what I was looking for.If you want a fancy, heavy keyboard that has all the do-dads and bing-bangs, get a different one. Then deal with that company's junk software bothering you all the time. Get a mechanical keyboard so that when you press a button once it enters that button three times, all so that you can use that backspace more often. Fun.Or just get this keyboard. The lights aren't super bright, sure. It doesn't have a lot of weight to it. You might even want to get a pad for your desk so it doesn't slide around.

I immediately plugged the headset into my laptop and played some music. BOOM complete sound control I hear nothing that is going on such as TV, or if anyone is talking to me, because the sounds is completely between my ears and whats playing. If you take off the headset while music or sound is playing the sound is pretty loud, however not loud to where it hurts your ears. It has volume control and a switch for turning mic on or off.

  I am a first time buyer of PC  products and this keyboard was first to arrive at my door. When I opened the Amazon box I was pleased to find out it was mine and not my brothers package. As I opened I saw a nice black box that I soon figured out was the box cover under that cover was a bright orange box that said ""Hello! Thank you for choosing Havit."" This was a nice introduction to the new keyboard and mouse combo I had ordered. The packaging was great too. This box had latches that held the rest of the cardboard in place until unlatched. I will definitely reuse the box. Upon opening it I saw a mouse with its own nice and tidy plastic compartment and a keyboard wrapped in a nice soft packaging material that covered it almost entirely except from the side that it was pulled out from. I plugged both the keyboard and mouse in and they both worked as advertised. It took a couple seconds to get the lights running but it did in fact work. The lights flooded rainbow color across the board and the mouse started in its red position then started ""breathing"" colors. I did see music changing keys that also excited me.Reading through the manual that was included I figured out a couple new things about the keyboard and mouse. One thing I didn't figure out is how to change your keyboard and/or mouse to a specific color of your choosing. I still don't know if it is possible but If its not I would be fine with it. Although if you are looking for a color themed computer this would not be the keyboard for you unless I'm not doing something right to change the color to what I want but I do believe the mouse is unchangeable so that would almost have to mean the keyboard is as well. To rate this product I would say I am very satisfied with my product it was just a little hard to know about the colors when you don't read Amazon's print over the product but its fine I'm still happy with it.

  The keyboard is a great beginners basic gaming keyboard. IT works nicely, no problems thus far. The rainbow backlight is nice and calming and not too overdone. I haven't done too much experimenting to see if you can turn the backlight off. One complaint I have is that the actual keys themselves do not light up so when playing in the dark you see the backlight but all of the keys are darkened by the competing light and overall lack of light in the room. We have a booklight that we clip on to the keyboard for when it is being used at night so we can see all of the keys and know what they are. If you become quickly adapted to the lay of the keyboard it won't be an issue, but regardless of how used to or how long I've used a keyboard, I tend to always need the keys to be lit up.

Pushing down on the sides of the keyboard turns the lights on, and they'll stay on bright for a few minutes but then flicker and die down. I can only assume something came loose inside the actual keyboard, or it's not lined up properly? Either way, I was going to try to try and make sure the screws were tight and not loose on the back but there's already 2 screws that have been a bit stripped. It may be something that happened in the assembly as there is some damage to the plastic around the 2 spots, but I'm not confident I want to bother with it. At this point, the lights pretty much wont turn on at all

  KeyboardPros: Great valvue, easy to use, and good looking. The lights work as they are designed to with simple on/off and 2 brightness+ breath light effect.The Mouse is pretty comfortable and simple to set up and use. The quick DPI are good for quick adjustments.Cons: The keyboard has key set up that might hinder game players because there is extra column of keys to the left of tab keys. The keyboard has rubber feet to stop it from slipping but when you use the front keyboard legs to stand up the rubber feet do not touch ghe ground and the keyboard becomes pretty slippery. The mouse has the DPI button close to the center of the mouse that sometimes gets pressed accidently.Customer service:Pros: After mentioning the slipper feet of the product to the cust care agent, the agent quickly responded and emailed me back a solution and a replacement product. The agent was extremely apologetic and respectful about the issues i had.Cons: The agent lacks full grasp of the english language and the communication was slightly tough because of that but because of the quick responses i was able to make sure we were clear on what was happening.Overall a worth buy. I recommend use mouse mat or keyboard mat for the bottom of the keyboard... However i like the product and rate it 4.5/5
