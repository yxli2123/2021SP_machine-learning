  I was skeptical that the breakfast sandwich maker could replicate a sandwich that I would purchase.  Actually, these taste better and it is so easy to use.  I can't believe how perfectly the sandwiches cook.  I used English muffins, Canadian bacon, egg and cheese for our first ones.  Next, I plan to try frozen pancakes, egg, and bacon or Canadian bacon from a recipe that came with the sandwich maker.Very impressed!

  This is a great little item. I never give 5 stars. So that is why 4. But, this is very good. I just received product, opens it up, and made a sandwich. That simple. No assembly.  Easy instructions. So simple. Just plug it in, let it heat up, put half a muffin in bottom tray, layet what you want on top, meat,cheese, veg etc. Lower middle tray, crackers egg in it, set top muffin half on it,and close top. Wait about 2 to 3 minutes, time depend on what you have, I can open it an check. Then, when done open top, slide/rotate the middle flat tray that egg is on,rotate it out,and it now is all together as sandwich. Lift it up and out. Done. The device is very small and compact which I love, not a big bulky thing, and it fits anywhere in kitchen. Great item.

  This thing is a neat little appliance.  Makes decent tasting sandwiches however my issue is with my cheese getting completely melted and making a horrible mess.  The pictures show a perfectly melted cheese slice but in my experiences that's not that case.  Will have to try some different cheese and see if it will fix the problem.Edit: as stated in the comments fold the cheese from the corners to the middle and melting out problem fixed.

  I have quite a drive to work in the morning, so usually I pull through a drive-thru and get a breakfast sandwich to eat in the way.  No more.  I bought this sandwich maker during the holidays and it is wonderful!  I put the bottom part of a muffin, then cracked an egg, then top part of the muffin.  I didn’t scramble the egg.  Closed it and 5 minutes later I had breakfast.  I plan to try adding cooked sausage and bacon some days, but this plain sandwich was so fast!  Also appliance is easy to clean.  Very pleased!

  Not worth it. I was really surprised how much I don't like it given all of the glowing reviews. Our hope was to kick out a hot sandwich in 3 minutes or so (not including preheat time). Nope.

  Wow! My hubby says this is the best Fathers Day present he's ever gotten. It's easy to assemble, folks fast, the sandwich is duo crispy, steamy, and savory after less than 5 min! And clean up It's easy too. It's really small so it easily stashes away in a drawer. It's very simple which makes it great and worthwhile purchase that you will USE. I hate clutter so I tend to stay away from kitchen gadgets, but I really like this thing. It's fun to make breakfast sandwiches! The recipe book is pretty scarce, though, but you can easily make up recipes. Yesterday I made mini bagel, egg, mild green chilis, pepper Jack cheese and sirloin steak sandwiches!

  I bought this as a Christmas present for my husband. It arrived on schedule, and on Christmas we opened it up. The sandwich maker was initially smaller than I expected but that was no big deal. We followed the directions: Letting it heat up until the light turns green, we used non-stick cooking spray and for the sandwich we had bought english muffins and precooked sausage patties. The maker is really easy to use. We put the bottom piece of the muffin in the bottom section along with a sausage patty, then in the top sections we cracked open an egg and broke the yolk as directed and put the top part of the muffin on last. I closed the lid and the directions said to let it cook for about 5 minutes. After the timer was up we moved the plate that separates the top and bottom aside and then opened the maker up to reveal a nicely cooked sandwich. The muffin was not burnt it was perfectly toasted, the egg had been cooked nicely and was shaped the same size as the muffin and the sausage had been heated thoroughly. When we were done and it was cool it's as easy as just lifting the pieces out of the maker to be cleaned. Overall, I really like this sandwich maker. I only give it 4 stars because I had bought bagels to use as well, but they were too big for the maker. Also, if using frozen patties I would suggest warming them up a little first because they were heated in the maker, but could have been heated a little more.

  I would have given it 5 stars except all of the little screws in the removable “dishwasher safe” part rusted almost immediately. They should have been made with stainless steel.  Otherwise, nice little machine. Also, if you have more than a 1-person household I would recommend you consider the dual sandwich maker so you can make 2 in one go.

  Big fan of this item and have had one for many years (in silver) and decided to buy another.  This one in red for some reason was extremely loose in the connection for the sandwich maker and the egg continually leaked out.  I tried it several times and to no avail.  Can't believe it is because of the color of the unit but bought another somewhere else in silver again and it is fine.  Maybe a bad lot! But we DO love the item.

  These are a great for making breakfast sandwiches.  We bought the first one on Amazon based on the recommendation of a friend.  It didn't take long for this to become one of our favorite appliances.  It cooks an egg sandwich in 4 minutes, cleans easily and the insert is dishwasher safe.  Because it uses very little electricity we bought one for our RV and we love it for camping trips.  I guess you could say we went a little crazy over this little device because we have purchased them as gifts for family members also.  I can't say enough good things about this product and it is very inexpensive for what you get and what it does.

  Works great! I would recommend that you make sure if you place ham or something in between the plates to make sure it is tucked in there and that it is not sticking out. We had the ham sticking out the first go around and the egg spilled out a little. Next time fixed the ham and pushed it into the bottom and it worked great! if you use cheese too it helps mold everything together. I also used scrambled eggs and worked great too.

  This product is easy to use as instructed. However, when making eggs that are scrambled they do not cook very well. It's really meant more for a Sunny side egg. I find if you are doing a scrambled egg the egg gets soaked up into the bread. You have to pre cook the egg a little first and cheese gets pretty messy melting. In the future I would not add cheese to these sandwiches.

  Got this gadget 3 days ago and already have used it several times for breakfast and lunch.  Having 3 kids and working myself, we are so rushed in the mornings, and cold cereal gets old.  Bought this and the kids love it, my 11 year old uses it herself. We bought English muffins, ham, cheddar slices, sausage patties, etc.  The ingredients are endless, I can’t wait to try other variations. After a few tries, you will perfect how to use it without egg spilling, cheese slipping off, etc.  I’ve been making breakfast sandwiches in the frying pan for years, this little machine is a super time saver!

  I bought this as a gift for my dad, who has eaten a chain restaurant Mc/Jack/BK breakfast sammie at least once a week for the last 25+ years or so.  As a recipient by proxy, my mom was pumped at the prospect of being able to combine faux-eggs with a boatload of veggies and it's-not-even-really-""cheese"" to make a ""healthier"" version.  After its first use, the parents reported success via text message photos of their sammie creations.  They also reported that it was easy to use and clean up after use.  My dad delighted in the instruction book (which reminds you to pre-cook the meats and not use it near water, like he was going to make breakfast in the shower, Kramer-style) and declared this ""the best gift I have ever received.""  5 stars, highly recommend!

We've used it far more than I would have predicted. We demonstrated it to two of our sons and they both bought on also, one even before he left for home.  We buy pre-cooked sausage patties, thaw them in the micro for 30 sec., scramble the egg and put it all together. In 5 minutes we have a good hot, filling breakfast sandwich. I don't care much for one use appliances, but this one is worth it and it takes up very little in the way of counter space.

  I love this product! It is as easy as it looks and all the great reviews are mirrored here without me having to repeat it. This product perfectly fits an English muffin, 1 egg, a few slices of PRE-COOKED bacon/ham/etc. You can add in some spinach, onion, tomato or a small amount of other veggies. The product takes about 5 minutes to preheat and 4-5 minutes to cook. Breakfast sandwich comes out piping hot and ready to eat in just a few minutes. Great for adults and kids and anyone on the go. The sandwich seems to all melt together and can be eaten while you walk or drive.Simple and very easy to clean. True nonstick! I just simply wipe it down with paper towel after each use.My only negative about this product is that it recommends you put the cheese in as you assemble and cook the cheese with everything else. I found 4-5 minutes seemed to melt the cheese completely out of the sandwich and all the cheese burned onto the sides of the English muffin. I've since added the cheese when the sandwich is done and it melts in perfectly. Nothing major!I would recommend this product to others and will add this to Christmas gifts this year.

  I've had this in my wishlist for a few months so when there were some reward points in my account I ordered one for our office. We've had it for about a week now and I have to say that everyone is loving it. It gets turned on around 7:30am and we cook up our own breakfast sandwiches until 8am, each one taking about 4 minutes to prepare. Some bring ham, others are using precooked sausage patties or Canadian bacon. We've also used diced ham which seems to be the favorite choice.As far as the machine goes, I'm impressed. It preheats quickly, the egg section does not leak or stick if you give it a quick spray of cooking oil, the egg cooks well and the cheese is always melted well . The instructions say that 5 minutes per sandwich is needed for cooking time, that's way too much in my opinion. We've cut back to 4 minutes, the eggs are always fully cooked and the sandwich is way too hot too handle. (a small wood or plastic spatula is a must!)Could the unit be improved? If the egg section was slightly smaller in diameter the egg probably wouldn't fold over the edges of the muffin top and that would make sandwich handling a little better in my opinion. If I could find a larger muffin that wouldn't be an issue. That's just me, I can't take points away for that.Would I buy another? HELL YES! This thing is great, everyone starts out the day happy and contented with a little breakfast at the office. Everyone just picks up the ingredients they like and our cost per sandwich is less than $1 per. I was stopping at the c-store each morning and spending $2.75 for a crappy sausage biscuit every morning. This is more satisfying, healthy and convenient in my opinion.

This has streamlined the process and minimized the mess. We love it! It takes only a minute or so to heat up and 4.5 minutes to make the perfect breakfast sandwich.An added plus-it's compact size makes it easy to store or to leave out on the counter.A few notes:This works best with english muffins.It will work with smaller bagels (like the regular sized Lenders) but the lid does not close all the way with the thicker bread.Other bread items such as pancakes, crumpets etc. will have to be trimmed to fit into the 3.75""(internal measurement) circular rings of the cooker (or made to fit).This device gets really hot-would recommend using mitts when using this machine (just like the instructions say to do).If you like breakfast sandwiches, I would not hesitate to purchase this product.

  Took this to my kids house and this really was a big hit for breakfast. We used it with ham and bacon. We used regular eggs, eggs in a carton and duck eggs. I have two recommendations... Use smaller eggs. Don’t use large or jumbo eggs. They will spill out. And once you remove your sandwich if using English muffins cover them in a bowl and let them rest for a bit before eating. The bread is crunchy when first removed from machine. Covering them and letting them sit softens the bread back up. It is easy to use, easy to clean and the sandwiches we made each morning were very good!

  Two stars instead of one only because it technically does what it says which is make an egg sandwich. It’s small so the only bread I’ve found that fits is English muffins. Not sure how you would find croissants or bagels that would fit in it. And not regular sandwich bread either. The top bread that goes over the egg sinks into the egg so it’s just one fused blob. Adding cheese makes a mess. Only egg, meat, and muffin works.  Still takes a while between preheating and cooking. Including cooling off enough to eat count on upwards of 15 minutes from plugging in until you have a sandwich you can eat. Used it a few times, probably won’t ever use it again. Disappointing.

  BEST GIFT FOR MYSELF!!!!!!  I cannot stress enough how amazing this is.  On weekends I make a complete sandwich in the machine, and on weekdays I just use the bottom half and make a perfect egg sunny side up, put it in a tupperware and throw an  english muffin or bagel with a slice of cheese in a ziploc and toast the bread at work, reheat the egg in the microwave and put it all together...i had a healthy, deeeelicious breakfast at work and save so much money on a daily basis, as my breakfast would average $5-8 every morning and a dozen eggs costs like $3-4!

  Omg I really love this thing! I got this for my husband for fathers day but I'm the one using it every day lol. It's super easy and makes perfect breakfast sandwiches. you'd think there would be a big mess with cheese and egg but the non stick surface works great and I've had to do nothing more than give it a quick wipe with a dish rag. Its super small which is a plus as my kitchen is crowded with gadgets. It's also quick to heat up and very simple to use. I really can't find anything to complain about.

  This looks like a ridiculous Sold On TV Infomercial gadget, but it's not at all.  My son uses it at college and loves it.  We all used it while he was home for Christmas.  We put the muffin in while it is warming up and this helps the muffin be a little more toasted. Otherwise we follow the directions. Very easy to clean. This is a ridiculously fun kitchen gadget that you won't regret buying.

  I love this. I thought it was going to be complicated and since I'm a senior I'm used to writing easy notes for myself, but this is so easy to use I tossed my notes after the first time. It's fast & easy to put a sandwich together and that makes things great for arthritic hands. The cooking parts are all one jointed piece, so that makes cleaning easier too.  I'm really happy with this.

    Amazing breakfast sandwiches in ~7-8 minutes.

  I stumbled upon this sandwich maker looking for a gift idea for my other half who is forever toasting some toast,  scrambling some eggs and pan frying some sausage or bacon -  just to slap it all together into a sandwich with multiple dirty dishes left to cleanup.  Have only tried english muffins,  eggs and Canadian bacon so far but the possibilities are endless,  excited to try some new things.  This little reasonably price sandwich maker is something I don't know if I can live without ever again and wish I had known about it earlier.It is very easy to use.  Pre-heat the unit until the green light turns on (~2-3 mins),  load up the bottom part of your sandwich with your bread (biscuit,  english muffin or mini-bagel),  cheese and pre-cooked meat.  Close first lid then drop your egg in (large eggs seem like they might be about the max),  season,  drop the top of your bread on top and close the lid - wait 5 minutes,  flip the egg door open to combine the sandwich - lift the entire lid and you have a piping hot breakfast sandwich ready to go.One bad is this has made it far to easy to throw together a delicious breakfast sandwich at any hour.  9:30PM and I don't feel like heating up leftovers - rev up the breakfast sandwich maker.  Don't feel like cooking dinner - rev up the breakfast sandwich maker.  2 hours until brunch but 2 hours after breakfast and feeling a bit peckish - rev up the breakfast sandwich maker.

    If You Really Love Egg Sandwiches
  
",3.0,C. Robinson,"Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  It's actually pretty simple, but awkward and a little dangerous. It gets very hot and only certain areas can be touched--read the directions carefully. English muffins are the right size, but any other kind of bread has to be cut to fit. After I'd used it three times I decided it really isn't worth the trouble; the resulting sandwiches are good enough, but I'm not that fond of eggs.

  This is an awfull product. You can't make anything in this. It leaks. It takes forever to make the sandwich. And then you get a soggy sandwich. It a waste of money. They advise you to use scrambled eggs.... Then why did I buy it. I thought it was all in one. Don't buy it. Also, only miniature bagels will fit in ot tiny English muffins, nothing standard. And your bacon or ham will not cook.

  I bought this for the IT office where I work. I have been using this since the back end of August 2013 and we all love this device...especially since it has gotten cold outside.  I'm not sure what to make of the reviews that indicate that the egg has seeped out.  I have not encountered this once.  One of my co-workers did...but it was because he did not completely shut the swing away plate completely closed.  Timing has to be adjusted to everyone's likes but for the most part, having used often over the course of the last 3 months...this device works really well.  I am giving a lot of these away as Christmas gifts this year.

  I've heard mixed reviews about this. Some people (like Alton Brown) said it was junk, but I really like it. I don't give myself enough time to cook breakfast in the morning before work because typically I'm leaving the house anywhere between 6:30 and 7:30 am, so I get up, get ready and go. I like to grab my breakfast on the go or something I can put together when I get to work. A gadget like this helps, because not only are frozen breakfast sandwiches expensive, but they are honestly gross. This is cheaper and tastes better. Only thing about it is that it's best to make it and then let it sit for like 10 minutes because it's very hot when it comes off and it's messy. Letting it sit to cool down keeps it together and more manageable to eat. I've used ham, that precooked microwavable bacon, steak-ums and frozen sausage patties (which is the only one I precook in the microwave before I put it in the sandwich to cook with it). I like to make my sandwich the night before, put it in a sandwich baggie and then microwave it for like 30 seconds in the morning when I get to work. Very convenient for me.

  Extremely nice. Makes PERFECT sandwiches!! Just follow the directions carefully—pre-heat, completely close the egg hot plate, don’t push down on the top cover, and only use up to a large-size egg. Also it helps if you pour the egg batter in slowly to allow it to cook a little as you pour so it doesn’t leak. Don’t add sugary items as they might burn as things cook (add that afterwards).I may have strange tastes but here’s my recipe: English muffin bottom + 1 cheddar cheese slice + 2 cooked ham slices (or 2 pre-cooked bacon slices, broken in halves) + large egg batter + 1/4 TBS peanut butter + English muffin top. I found the peanut butter burned a little so you might want to add that after it’s done. Yum!

  We regularly spent $10 a weekend on Panera breakfast sandwiches (which I still very much love) but in an effort to be more financially conscious, we bought this sandwich maker and it is AWESOME.  Takes a little prep work... we cook our bacon first and scramble the egg a little bit in a separate bowl, but other than that it is SO easy!  It literally comes out as a perfectly cooked piece of breakfast architecture.  English muffin, perfectly cooked bacon, scrambled egg (little salt and pepper) and Vermont white cheddar... My God, it's glorious.  Very easy to clean too.  Does it GET any better??

  I bought this as a White Elephant gift, but my son ended up with it at the end of the game so it came home with us. I’m surprised at how convenient this little sandwich maker is. I was really worried about cracking an egg into it but the plate is so hot there is no spill-over. As someone who tends to skip breakfast, this is a great way to make something quick with a good amount of protein. My favorite combination, so far, is english muffin, pre-cooked sausage patty, cheddar, egg, spinach leaves. Not only do all the ingredients come together nicely, but the muffin gets nice and crispy on the outside. Clean up is easy since the stacking segments come out so everything can be wiped down.

  I needed to replace my old Hamilton Beach Breakfast Sandwich Maker as the old one (very many years old) was peeling on the inside.  Not sure that it was safe to use with food with non-stick surface peeling off.  So I ordered a new one - exactly the same but seemed flimsy.  The center section is very loose and the insert comes off much too easily.  I'm sure it will be fine and I ordered a second one for our vacation home.  It's a great addition to the kitchen and has a small footprint.  You can use it without a muffin and just slide the egg & bacon/ham on to toast over a slice of cheese.

  Overall I really like this product.  My only comment is that it's a little too small to accommodate a bagel as was suggested as a possible bread choice.  Otherwise, the product performs as described.  It's a small unit so it fits nicely, and can remain, on the counter.  Because of the time it takes to cook the egg, cheese does get VERY melted (I use thick slice, real cheese) so it can get a bit messy but it's nice to have a fairly quick option in the morning besides cereal and this provides that option.

  I love this thing. I recommend it to everyone that enjoys breakfast sandwiches.One suggestion for people that get this though. I dont follow the step exactly. They have you put the top piece of breading on when the egg is still raw. I cook the egg first, pull the slide so the egg drops on the sandwich (this point the egg is basically done cooking. it just stays hot), then put my top piece of bread in there. Following the instructions before made the top piece soggy and it seemed the middle of the egg didnt get fully cooked.

  I eat a lot of breakfast sandwiches because they are so convenient but have always had to pay the high price of frozen sandwiches from the grocery store or had to stop at a fast food place.  When I saw this product I was so excited, and it has not disappointed me.  It is the only appliance I actually leave out on my counter.  It feels very well made, it's super easy to clean up, but most importantly it is as easy and quick as they say it is.  I feel much better about eating them now because I know exactly what is going into them, (It's non stick so I don't have to use any butter at all), and can pick and choose what I put in them.  My only issue is that the egg is much larger than the english muffin so it forces me to use a knife and fork but hopefully I can find larger muffins.  (Do they sell different sized muffins?)  Unfortunately, it has to be that big though or it wouldn't work with the other options like bagels.  Maybe in version 2 they can make different sized rings.  I only paid $25 bucks on Amazon for this and it will pay for itself really quick.  Love it.

No big deal really...we just add it when we add our condements. The only regret we have is we should have bought the double sandwich maker instead of the single!!!

  I was on the fence about buying this based on reviews but I did anyway. Got it home and thought, ""what the heck, there are no instructions and it seems like stuff would leak out."" Well, there were on the box type of instructions and a fast internet search did the trick. At the time I was low carb and made a cheese bun with it that had sausage and egg. It turned out great! My husband has made a few sandwiches and they are impressive. I noticed it work really well if you use a whole egg and just barely pop the yoke. My husband whisked an egg and asked shredded cheese and it fluffed up like a mini quiche. We have had minimal leakage but for some reason only when you whisk the egg. It literally makes a hot and yummy sandwich in 5 minutes. As a side note, I had homemade bread and no muffins so I took a slice of bread and placed it on the bottom layer of the machine and just brought down the ring above it to punch out a round bread. Of course do this when the unit is off. Made a nice and toasty bread and egg sandwich.Please be very careful as this thing gets SUPER hot almost immediately. Definitely not for use by small children.

  I ordered this because the double sandwich one wasn't available.  This won't work for us. Five minutes to cook one sandwich, wait 2 minutes more to preheat, then 5 minutes more for second sandwich.  This would great if you only want one sandwich. No problem with the unit.

  This handy dandy maker is great. I use it everymornnig to make 2 sandwiches. I was using bagels but it is too small to fit. English muffins are the way to go for sure. I add turkey slices and cheese when cooking. I make a sausage patty on the stove and add that after it is cooked other wise it is too thick with the sausage layer and doesn't heat and cook as well. never had the yoke undercooked - just make sure the light is on before putting it all on.

  I've used it twice today, and frankly it's probably the worst thing I've ever purchased.  I wanted it to serve a specific purpose, and it failed miserably at that.  It leaks everywhere; it does nothing that I couldn't accomplish simpler with a microwave, small skillet, and a toaster; and just trying to lift the lid after spinning the egg slider according to the directions... the accursed thing falls apart mid-open and resulted in burning my thumb trying to catch it by reflex.  Don't waste the twenty-plus dollars, just get a decent small skillet if you really want to make breakfast sandwiches.

  This is a great product and really simple to use! It takes about 7-8 mins to make a great healthy sandwich and this includes the warm-up time. One thing I was concerned is that the cleaning would be pain in the butt and would drive me to eventually stop using it-not the case! All I do after my sandwich is ready is wipe it off once with paper towel and it's like new. Nothing ever sticks to the burners that would require some extra cleaning. Also, this thing is really tiny and it doesn't take up any space. My only regret is that I wish I've bought the one with 2 sandwich makers.

  I love this sandwich maker.  You can use a variety of ingredients to make a healthy sandwich great for breakfast, lunch, or snacks.  It cleans up easily.  I use a quick squirt of Olive Oil Spray, drop in an English Muffin half, add meat of my choice or nothing, then cheese, drop the egg chamber, add the egg, break the yolk, dash of pepper and top with the other half of muffin.  In 5 minutes your sandwich is done.  My only caution is when you slide the egg separator out to drop the egg on the cheese, lift just enough to clear the sandwich and slide back to the cook position immediately before opening all the way.  The top part comes off easily for cleaning and can tip off the appliance due to the egg plate being off to the side and thus unbalanced.  The technique is easy to master (took me once or twice to figure it out) and no big deal.

  Well, the product was received at my home without any damage, and in a very timely manner.  However, even using the appliance several times, without fail, the raw egg would leak out of the upper container where the directions and video clearly illustrate it to be placed along with the muffin on top of it.  Before the egg could cook, it leak out from either one side, or both sides of its designated compartment.  This in itself created a mess on the appliance and on my kitchen counter.  Additionally, it took more than four to five minutes to cook the egg, so by the time the egg was fully cooked, both the top and bottom pieces of the English Muffin were cooked as hard as a rock and nearly uneatable.  I could not recommend this product to anyone, and would never give it as a gift.  If you have read this review, than remember that you have been warned.

  I ordered this little appliance for Christmas gifts this year -- 4 of them -- on the recommendation of my brother who loves his sandwich maker. The family recipients gave great feedback and I also ordered the sandwich maker cookbook as well as for two family members who got the little sandwich spatulas as well. Those ""accessories"" were featured in the section ""Those who purchased this also bought these...."" or whatever that topic is at the bottom of the page. I liked the fast shipping (even though others had a problem with the delivery companies closer to Christmas) and the size of the machine. It's a good appliance for those who ""have everything"" and didn't know they needed it.  The one drawback on gifting one of these is they do not come in the manufacturer's packaging, which would have been nice for getting the UPC code off the box and sending it in for the $5.00 rebate featured at the walk-in stores. Otherwise, it was convenient and probably worth the $20 (for the 4 I ordered, 2 of which were sent directly out of state) so I did not have to drive to the store,fight the crowds, wrap and prepare the packages for shipping, and then get to the post office.

The sandwiches look and taste just like an egg mcmuffin--maybe even better.

So I'm usually making him one breakfast when he gets up at 5:30 or 6 and then he's hungry again by the time we leave for school at 7:30 so I'm always rushing out the door and then stopping to grab him a slice of breakfast pizza or sandwich.  Ugh...a growing boy! :)Well, my problem has been solved!  We walked through making the first sandwich this morning after just getting it last night, and then he made breakfast sandwiches for all of us!  I cannot tell you what a great sandwich it made!  The English muffin was perfectly toasted and tender and egg was nicely cooked and cheese melted.  The combinations are endless what you could do with this, thin bagels, waffles, pancakes, croissants!  Don't hesitate to get this if you have kids at home or in college.

HOWEVER, i thought as a gift for my other kids to use in their dorm rooms it might work.  So i bought one and put a question mark on the gift wrapped present and everybody wondered what it would be.We love it.  Use as has been recommended here.Heat for 4 to 5 min.  Have your eng muffin or bagel ready (cut to size if necessary, esp the bagel--you may want to thin the bagel so it's a good fit).  Place a precooked sausage patty on top with a slice of cheese.  Lower the second ring and use a spritz of vegetable spray on the warming plate, making sure it is all swung all the way to the left.  Crack your egg or pre scramble it and place on warming plate.  Top off with precooked bacon or just the remaining top of your muffin or bagel and close the lid.  I cook for 4:44 min. and it's done.  Swing open the warming plate and lift the lid and have spatula ready to remove the food from the Maker.  Perfecto!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  WE LOVE IT.  Easy to use.  Easy to clean.

Ironically, my 16 yr. old son who originally turned me on to it will get the use of it here, and the two college bound kids do not want one for their dorm rooms (not convenient enough, what with the need for eggs and cheese to be kept in a dorm room).Highly recommend.

  Maybe it's because I added cheese to mine and it melted all over everything.  The English muffins toast up nicely on one side and the egg comes out perfectly cooked.  The cheese melted all over the unit and not on the muffin.  That really caused a mess to clean up and the whole process took twice as long as cooking things normally and tossing the skillet in the dishwasher.  It's headed to the thrift store.

  A friend recommended this and it really is the best kitchen gadget I think we own. The sandwiches come out perfectly every time... better than an egg mcmuffin. The bread toasts (we use English muffins) perfectly. My only challenge is using a regular bagel makes things a little tight and the more meat you add (Canadian bacon / sausage), the more stuffed the machine get and makes it tougher to stay completely closed... it still makes a perfect egg sandwich, it just doesn't close tightly while it cooks. I use cooking spray on the egg plate and that makes it even easier for the egg to just slide right out and down onto the rest of the sandwich. The clean up takes less than a minute. My children use this almost every day. I have seen a newer version that comes with a timer. I may buy another one of these and I'll get the one with the timer since you do need to set either 4 or 5 minutes on a timer to get the perfectly cooked egg - it would be nice not to have to use my phone or the kitchen oven timer.

  I have been using this for 9 months multiple times a week. Throughout that period it served me well and I really liked its ease of use. However, yesterday while I was washing the removable part, a small portion around the hinge started to peel off.

  My husband loves McDonalds breakfast sandwiches.  We decided to try this sandwich maker to see if it would measure up to his favorite.  Sure enough......it works just like advertised.  The only problem is finding english muffins that exactly fit the sandwich maker.  Usually the cheaper ones are the ones that fit.  Canadian bacon is perfect for this.  If you want sausage patty, you need to cook it first.  Bacon is best if you cook it first and chop it.  The egg slides right off.  Just be sure that the plate it sits on is closed all the way before you pour it the egg, otherwise it will leak.

    A little more time consuming but worth it for the final product.
  
",4.0,Andrew W.,"Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2015","









  
  
    
  It takes about 3 minutes to heat up, about a minute to put all the fixings in and another 4-5 minutes to cook so it is a bit of a process for one sandwich.  I make a lot of eggmcmuffin type breakfasts (English muffin, Canadian bacon, American cheese and egg) and I can do it with a toaster and a stove in about 4-5 minutes tops.  So from a time saving standpoint this sandwich maker fails for me.With that said, The great thing about it is the final product.  Because of the way you assemble and cook the ingredients you are left with a great tasting and unique sandwich I have been unable to replicate on the stove.  What is great for me is the way the egg and the top piece of bread cook together (i.e. you can't separate them once cooked).  The taste and texture of this is outstanding.  So is the depth of the egg.  On the stove unless you use some sort of mold the egg always gets a little flat.  Here it comes out melted to the bread with a nice depth.Despite the added time, the end product is well worth the cost of this sandwich maker.

  Works well, easy to clean, easy to store, but it's not perfect. The sandwich does not taste the same when the English muffin is toasted on the outside and has a ""raw"" middle. The sandwiches are still pretty good and this sandwich maker has paid for itself several times over already. $2 for a fast food sandwich or about $.30 to make it yourself. Make your own coffee too and start planning a weekend getaway with the money you save every year.

  I was so looking forward to using this breakfast sandwich maker, so I can make my own at home,  but was very disappointed when it arrived defective. A screw was missing from one of the hinges, which I eventually found among the packaging material. No problem, I thought, but when I tried to put the screw back in, it wouldn’t  tighten. It just kept going around and around, and the hinge remained very floppy. I opted to return the machine, rather than having it replaced because it seemed like just another flimsy, cheaply made import from China. I might try again with another brand, and will probably pick one up at a brick and mortar store, where I can hopefully open it there to make sure it’s okay before taking it home. I’ve used one of these machines before at my son’s house, and it worked beautifully, and made a breakfast sandwich just like the ones at McDonald’s. There should be better quality control on all imports.

  I was hoping I'd save time making breakfast by having a breakfast sandwich maker. Unfortunately, this appliance didn't cut down on my breakfast time, though I'm able to make food that's more portable than my usual breakfast meals.The most annoying thing about this appliance is that the egg spills out when you crack it on the hot plate. It helps to give it more time to heat up, so that the plate is hotter and the egg starts cooking once you crack it on.

",3.0,Robert Killian,"Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2016","









  
  
    
  The idea seems good but the actual product has problems. e.g. the picture shows an egg on the upper level and half of the English muffin above it; if you actually cook like that, the top of the muffins gets over cooked and the eggs is under cooked and oozes out of the sandwich. I am going to try putting the muffin upside down under the egg so the egg soaks into the muffin and gets cooked by the element close above it; then I can turn I turn it upside down on the bottom half after cooking. Or put the egg on the bottom muffin half and the ham/bacon etc. on the top half. The basic idea of this product is good but the metal shelf between the two rings should fit tighter so raw eggs does not leek out before it gets cooked. It is a fun device to experiment cooking with.

  Im the type of individual who likes their breakfast sandwich made a certain way.  Call me picky if you want- I simply know what I like. Let me explain by component. First the bread. Im cool with an english muffin, bagel or croissant but it must be toasted. Secondly, the cheese I prefer is Cheddar and I like it because it can become melty without becoming runny. Thirdly, a ham steak cut to sandwich size browned nicely enchancing flavor all around. Lastly a nice firm egg patty. I occasionally add precooked turkey bacon and, ""Mmmmm!"" Unfortunately, this sandwich maker by Hamilton Beach wont toast my bread. It also wont brown my ham. My egg doesn't come out firm instead the half of bread above it sucks it all up and becomes an awful crossbreed of unsweetened french toast and soggy gunk. The cheese stays for the most part, but that is mostly due to the type cause my first attempt with American was horrid. I ended up chasing American entrails with my napkin as it leaked over the rim, onto my counter and set off on adventure. So for me...it gets the job done the way a 1-star Yelp rated restaurant gets the job done- its ""food"". If your rushing out the door and want something ""homemade"" to munch on, it may help. However, if you have tastebuds and care about what you put in your mouth then I suggest a just making it with a toaster and pan- the old fashioned, quality,tasty way.

  The product does what it is designed to do - and well. Sandwiches come out looking and tasting excellent. I was a little leery of placing the top piece of bread on the raw egg (as instructed) but this thing makes a mean sandwich. Operation is a cinch - Cleanup is easy.However - I am only giving three stars as it is missing some basic kitchen appliance features - such as a power switch and a timer. To use the device you have to plug it in, and when your done, unplug it. This to me is rather crude and old fashioned - why does it have a power switch like every other device in my kitchen? Never-mind the fact my plugs are way back and hard to get to. This leads to the other item - lack of a timer.  You have to manually time 5 minutes and unplug the device when you think the sandwich is cooked. While I get that different sandwiches could take different times depending on ingredients, several times I have wandered off during the cook time and my sandwich has been very over cooked. Why not a basic ""Lite/Medium/Heavy"" switch like...you know, the toaster?

  I was super excited about buying this sandwich maker due to all of the glowing reviews. I even bought an 18-pack of eggs the day before it was scheduled to arrive. Sadly, it looks like the machine I received is defective. There is a huge gap in the back between the plate and the top ring (see photos), where the egg goes, despite my turning the plate as far in as it would go.What does that mean? It means that instead of enjoying a breakfast sandwich to start my morning yesterday, I spent ten minutes cleaning the raw egg off my counter that spilled out through the huge gap, which I hadn’t noticed until it was too late.Amazon refunded my money and I decided to give it another shot and ordered a replacement. We’ll see if this was a one-off defective machine or if their quality control has just gone downhill recently.

  As someone who's generally had apartments with small kitchens and thus a small amount of counter space, I'm not fond of single use appliances. I remember my brother getting a breakfast sandwich maker a few years ago and wondered why someone would give so much precious counter space to a glorified toaster. I got a quesadilla maker for Christmas a few years ago which gave me another reason to avoid this - the quesadilla maker is so hard to clean!My recent apartment has more space, so I bought this because of the amount of high reviews and my love of breakfast sandwiches. I should have bought it as soon as it came out - it's so much more compact than the toaster kind of sandwich makers and does it's job extremely well. Preheating takes a few minutes, cooking takes 5 minutes and the whole center part is removable for cleaning.The center part stays put normally, you have to lift it up and out of the main part of it so there's little risk of burning yourself by something shifting unexpectedly. The main part of it is just two flat surfaces with only a couple small corners to have to wash stuff out of, which was my main complaint with the quesadilla maker.Anyway, this thing is amazing and totally worth the counter space it uses.

  Just received this sandwich maker a couple of days ago and used it for the first time this morning.  It does what it's advertised to do.  The first sandwich, I put the bottom of the English muffin in first with cheese which I tore up to fit exactly on top of the muffin, and then the bacon. Second compartment I put 1 jumbo egg and broke the yoke with a fork and placed the English muffin top right on top of that and closed the lid making sure not to push it down. Waited five to six minutes and and it was done.  The second sandwich, I switched it up, and scrambled the egg with a small amount of milk and threw in the bacon chopped up in with the egg. Same results. A nice hot bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. Be advised, the egg puffs up quite a bit so I can't imagine having to use more than one jumbo egg. Furthermore, I would like to add that I had NO problem with the egg leaking out the sides of the ring as others have stated in their reviews. You must make sure the handle to the disc the egg is cooking on is all the way over to the right and you do NOT push down on the top cover after all your ingredients are in and ready to cook. There is one issue I did have. The cooking discs/rings come out so you can wash them. Be careful lifting the bottom ring to remove your sandwich because the whole thing came off too easily for my liking and landed on the counter next to the unit. Luckily I had pot holders near by to grab it. All in all, I am pleased with the results and I can see this little contraption being used quite often.

I also would think it would be improved if the top bread could be in it's own compartment for toasting and not soaking in the egg.I had previously bought the Westbend toaster egg cooker and loved it but the egg poaching cup started to peel.  I am mentioning Westbend because it was a better design but not better quality.  The Westbend comes with a water cup to determine the degree of softness / hardness to cook the egg, the water cup also has a piercing device at the bottom to pierce the yoke.  Hamilton Beach used to make a similar product but I am no longer able to find it.

  It's easy to make breakfast sandwiches using a toaster and microwave (a scrambled egg in a small dish or saucer comes out perfect for a sandwich after one minute in the microwave), but I thought this would be an alternative where I could combine all the individual steps into one simple one.  I'm satisfied with the result.  My only minor complaint is that the unit will come apart if you aren't careful when lifting the various pieces to assemble or remove your sandwich.  But if you are careful it won't happen.  One complaint people have is that you can only make one at a time.  But it really makes the sandwich too hot to eat right away anyway, so I think you could make a 2nd one and two people could still have a quick breakfast in 10 minutes.  The non-stick surface is very good--I don't even have to spray cooking oil on it.  For me, it's a keeper.

  I don't know how I lived without this!!

Even though I haven't used it much since giving birth, it is still a wonderful thing to have!  Going to get more as Christmas gifts!! Everyone loves a breakfast sandwich!!

  I love this little sandwich maker! I've just made the basic breakfast sandwich so far, but it is truly awesome! I love to have breakfast sandwiches in the morning, but the frozen ones get so boring and never turn out right. You either don't heat them up long enough and they are cold in the middle, or you heat them up too long and the bread is as hard as a rock. This little machine makes perfect sandwiches. The bread gets toasted just right, the meat is nice and warm, and the egg is cooked to perfection. It's easy to clean up and it only takes up a small amount of space on the counter. I only wish that it had a timer on the machine. Then it would be perfect. I can't wait to try out different recipes. It's a hit in my house, especially with my picky eaters.

    It cooks eggs but...
  
",3.0,BUSINESS-Nevada,"Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  This technically works and I wonder if I'm doing something wrong since other reviewers love it...It cooks the egg really well but the bread (English muffin) does not toast well and the top piece became like a soggy part of the egg. My friend has one and only cooks the egg in this and separately toasts the bread...HUH? Needs some design improvements if you want it to taste good.That said, it does warm and cook like it says just doesn't taste good to me.

  Need gadget... but it's a bit difficult to use.  I'm super nervous about burning myself so I'm overly cautious when opening it and removing the sandwich.  For some reason the hinge part easily comes off and I've had that fall off twice when I am lifting it up.  It falls onto my counter but again, nervous it will fall on the floor or myself and burn something.  It cooks the eggs perfect but I do struggle with the sausage.. it's hard to find sausage that fits correctly in here.  Either they are too big or too small.

    Egg yolk leaking
  
",1.0,cincin,"Reviewed in the United States October 3, 2019","









  
  
    
  I saw this product and I thought it is a good idea for a quick egg breakfast sandwich. The idea is very good but the implementation is very bad. The egg yolk leaks everywhere on the side and it is a mess to clean. It's true that the product is easy to clean but the leak reaches the counter top and it is not very pleasant to clean.Overall not a good product. I have returned it for a refund. Back to the traditional pan and toaster.

  I debated buying this for my husband as a gift.  I wondered if this sandwich maker would wind up sitting in a cupboard, unused.  Not so!  My husband LOVES this sandwich maker.  He uses it 2 or 3 times a week to make a breakfast meal using English muffins, sausage, cheese, and an egg.  He pronounced the finished sandwich delicious.  The sandwich cooks up nice and hot.  It's easy to wipe clean.  The only comment I would make is that if using a bagel, they are thicker than an English muffin and may need to be trimmed a bit before putting in the sandwich maker.  i would recommend this product.  PS - I noticed my husband stored the sandwich maker on my roundabout kitchen shelf, because he wants it handy to use.

  The concept of this machine sounded so appealing to me.  But, I find that just a plain english muffin, egg, cheese and canadian bacon has absolutely no flavor.  However, the machine did cook the sandwich, so there's nothing wrong there.  I did find clean-up a little cumbersome dealing with the ring assembly and the top/bottom cooking plates.  Overall, I wish I hadn't purchased.  I'll stick to skillets and toasters.

In your face boyfriend. It’s flimsy inside and a little wonky, but I watched other user videos and just followed them to quick breakfast. I have to be to work by 7 am and this is so easy. I get everything in and finish getting ready then head out the door With hot breakfast. But, do not put your cheese in with the sandwich. Put it on after, otherwise you get lava cheese.

  This little breakfast sandwich maker is my new favorite kitchen gadget. 4:30 is really the best time to use, as the person with the demonstration video mentioned. The egg will leak if it’s not oiled enough on the slot or if the oil is not hot enough, that’s probably the one downside. Another thing, slowly crack the egg like let the egg white slowly drip out of the shell a little bit, which sounds tedious, but not really a dealbreaker to me because the sandwich maker is pretty fun to use.

  I hope whoever came up with this idea got a big fat raise. What a novel concept: just drop in an English muffin, the meat, a slice of cheese, crack an egg and five minutes later, voila! Works best with precooked bacon or sausage, or higher quality ham... I’ve found that standard “hot dog section” sliced ham is a too wet and runny, and can leave a weird taste. Of course no meat works great, too!Skip the fast food line and save some cash/calories with this little thing.

  Bought on a whim, glad I did! Makes a superb egg, ham, cheese, and English muffin sandwich.  All the parts fit together and accommodate the ingredients as you build the sandwich.  It needs to be pre-warmed so the egg doesn’t drip but that’s simply a matter of plugging in and waiting for a light to come on telling you “okay.”  The top comes down and cooks a marvelous sandwich in about 4-5 minutes.  Clean-up is a breeze - says to hand wash but cooking element is easily accommodated in the dishwasher.  I’ve enjoyed this dude!

    No Fuss - No Muss - No Mess!  Perfect!
  
",5.0,my 2 cents,"Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2013","









  
  
    
  This is the perfect 'no fuss, no muss' 5-minute breakfast maker!  We plugged it in, waited for the 'Ready' light to come on (3-5 minutes), popped in our ingredients and in minutes had the perfect breakfast sandwich!  I used Orowheat English Muffins, a vegetarian sausage patty, shredded cheese and an egg.  Didn't experience one issue that others have had.  We looked at the pictures on how to place the items, popped them in and voila!  Yummy hot breakfast!  BTW..I've forgotten to 'pop the yolk' twice now and it still cooked through and no mess =0)  It's important to look at the pics because if you add cheese but nothing on top of it (like my veg sausage patty), the cheese may stick to the plate above it.  If you don't want to use a 'meat', then I would recommend putting the cheese on top of the egg and the top muffin over it.I noticed in the 'How To' photo that they used shredded cheese and not sliced which is why I used that type & I pre-cooked my patty since it came from the freezer (isn't that just common sense?!).  Remember to use a non-stick spray for ez clean-up!  After your done, just pop out the plates, wash & pop them back in...easy-peasy!  This little baby should have 5-stars across the board!  This was a Christmas gift for my mom who gets up early and enjoys a quick hot breakfast.  She loves this little thing & no more frozen breakfast sandwiches hogging space in the freezer!Kids could easily use this (what age is at the parents discretion) & it would be a great gift for the grandparents too!  It's so easy to use! Just be sure to tell them to only touch the handles (the plates get HOT!  HOT!  HOT!) and use a spatula to remove the sandwich from the hot plate.  This goes for EVERYONE! And..very important...be sure to unplug it after use (there is no 'on & off' button!) ;)  The second best thing about this machine, it's small.  So if you don't like cluttered countertops it nicely tucks away in a cabinet/pantry.Paid around $24 for it - don't pay more than $25 with free shipping.  If prices jump again (which they did after I bought it), go to your local wally world! =0)PS:  Mine came in ez packaging.  If you Google Hamilton Beach Breakfast Sandwich Maker you'll find the manufacturer's photos on how to layer your items (click on Images at top of screen). In the event you don't want to do that...Plug in and wait for the Ready light (Green).  When it's ready, open it up, spray with non-stick cooking spray (they don't show that), and with the bottom ring down, put your bottom muffin in, add shredded cheese & veg/'meat', lower the next plate and place your egg and top with the other muffin slice, close the top and let it work it's magic.  When the green light goes off...it's ready!  Lift up from the bottom handle to expose the entire sandwich.  Remember, it's going to be screaming hot when you add your goodies to it so be careful & be sure to use a spatula to remove it!!!

  I wouldn't have bought this if my husband didn't absolutely adore Sausage Mack Muffins (let's not violate a TM here, people).  But he can't have any, because commercial ones give him migraine headaches.  So I OCCASIONALLY make them at home, with middling success.  Till now.Amazon tempted me with this product, & I bit after reading the reviews, & I'm glad I did.Believe it or not, this makes TERRIFIC breakfast sandwiches (moist and well cooked) and they are EASY BREEZY to make.When I first opened the package, I thought this thing looked like something out of a Steven Spielberg movie (think the Mothership in Close Encounters of the Third Kind).  I bought the RED one, just because I like the color & I'm glad I did.  I store it on my microwave cart, out in the open, & it looks REALLY Sci Fi--two people have already asked me ""what the heck is that thing?""  But beyond being a conversation piece, it's  a really functional little appliance.  You can learn how to use it best by reading the Most Popular Review--it's very well spelled-out.The only trick I've added:  very LIGHTLY butter the outside of your muffins and use about 1/8 teaspoon of butter in the egg cup before adding your egg and breaking the yolk, then salt and pepper the egg, close the top, & cook ONE MINUTE before putting the top muffin on.  Then I open the lid, add the muffin top, & cook the sandwich for precisely 3 more minutes & voila--a perfect sausage & egg ""sammich"" emerges, with a crispy/moist muffin, well-cooked egg, and delightfully melty cheese.  Yum!  I usually don't eat these myself, but I've had TWO in the last two days (more time on the treadmill, as well).  Highly recommended; this was a surprisingly good and useful purchase!!!

It comes apart and you can wash the middle sections.  I have made breakfast sandwiches and frozen them.  I have made english muffin sandwiches, pancake sandwiches (using pancake batter), sandwiches with hashbrowns.  The only challenge is finding the right size bagel to fit in the machine, Lenders bagels work well for that.  I would highly recommend this little gadget.  Saved us lots of money and is much healthier than buying breakfast sandwiches.  I usually make them once a month to freeze for the kids to grab when they want them.

  If you're a fan of McDonald's McMuffins but  hate driving to the store, this is for you. It works as advertised.  I love the fact that I can now have two slices of Canadian bacon instead of just one.  But beware, there is no on or off button. You plug it in and wait for the green light which tells you the gadget is hot enough. You place a muffin on the bottom, place the Canadian bacon and cheese, then you flip the first lid on top of it.  You  place a egg and another muffin on top and close it. Then you have to set your timer for 5 minutes. It's not automatic. You can't put the entire gadget in the dishwasher, but you can take the two inner plates out and put them in the dishwasher. I have not had to use any spray on coating or grease.  So, great for making your own egg McMuffin but it is not automatic and you have to be careful around kids, because it does get hot and it will burn if you touch it while in use.

  I'm not really a kitchen gadget person OR an impulse buyer, but here we are. We eat eggs every day, because, chickens. We also all eat at different times every day. So, we've used this daily (sometimes several times) since it arrived. It takes about 4.5-5 minutes for a medium egg and 8 minutes for 100 grams of egg whites.PROS:1. I don't need to clean it. Yeah, the rings go in the dishwasher, but I haven't needed to do it since the first wash out of the package. Even cheese wipes off with a microfiber rag and it gets hot enough to kill anything else.2. You can use it just to cook eggs. You don't have to out anything in the bottom or on the top.3. So far it works with English muffins, small prefab frozen pancakes, and Ezekiel bread cut with a biscuit cutter.CONS:1. It's a bit awkward to maneuver the rings at first without accidentally wiggling them out or bumping the slider that keeps your eggs in place, so you can expect to experiment the first few times.2. The top is much hotter than the bottom so wait until the last 60 seconds to put in whatever the top bread is going to be if you don't want it blackened.3. Not  a con for us, but if you have several people eating at once, you might want to consider the double version. It's going to take at least 5 minutes per sandwich.

  Works GREAT...with some learning curve.  Let the unit heat up!!!  Put 1/2 of the muffin in the bottom level with some butter on it, put your favorite meat slices on it;  break your egg onto the second level and break the yoke (do NOT mix up your egg prior or it tends to run over), put your favorite cheese on top;  place the top half of the muffin on the top rack, and close it up.  Let it cook for around 5 minutes.  You won't be disappointed.

  Best product! My son loves Egg McMuffins but going to McDonald’s everyday is not going to happen. This is the best product for that! It’s sooooo simple.Bottom put bottom muffin then ham and cheese then close it to put the cracked egg and add top muffin and then it completely. I leave for 5 minutes then you take the knob and slide the middle piece out to make the sandwich whole. Boom. Egg McMuffin at home. Healthier too. Easy to use , easy to clean and you can create different sandwiches too. Recommend completly!!!

  I thought this would be an easy, no hassle way for my husband to make breakfast sandwiches, but upon opening the box and seeing the little piece of paper that comes with it, we both feel like it was a bait-and-switch. Although the product listing says the removable parts are dishwasher safe, the paper said that for best results, they should be hand washed. Strike one. Also, it says that to avoid a mess, you should only use whole eggs or egg whites, not store-bought egg whites (no Egg-Beaters). Strike two. If you can't just pour the egg whites from the carton and put the parts in the dishwasher when you're done, the convenience factor is lost. We're sending it back unused.

  This product is saving me time and money. I buy eggs, meats, cheeses and English muffins or biscuits on sale and my kids do all the work of preparing the sandwiches for breakfast or dinner. You place the bottom bread in the receptacle, add your cheese and/or meat on top, then add a beaten egg to the egg tray and throw the bread on top and close it and set your watch/timer for 4 minutes and take out a lightly toasted hot sandwich to eat on the go or enjoy at home. Truly a great product and I will be sending my daughter off to college with one! It saves people like me who are not morning people from making a trip to the McDonald's drive thru.

  The best small appliance I have ever bought!  My husband buys the microwaveable egg sandwiches that are frozen and they are pretty expensive, especially when you buy enough for the month.  He just grabs one and goes to work.  So not only did this little gadget work as well as it said, it will save us money in the long run.  The food is better since it's fresher and I just couldn't believe it took 5 minutes and the sandwich was done and without all that messy frying and smelling up the house.  Now, this is so easy, even my husband can do it without me if he had to.  I want to buy one for my kids, the one at college and the newly wed.  Also, the one here on Amazon was cheaper than the one I saw at the store and I had it in two days.

  I bought this for my boyfriend as a Christmas gift and he uses it every single day. Before that, he was pretty inconsistent about eating in the morning and this sandwich maker saves him from planning out breakfast. It enables him to make a quick and healthy meal everyday and the clean up is just as fast and easy. We get our eggs and English muffins in bulk and the rest he gets pretty creative with. Sometimes I make my healthy pancakes (2 eggs, a banana, some cinnamon... so good, please try!) in advance and use these instead of bread. A quick and wholesome McGriddle. There are really endless combinations as to what you can get into this little device. At first I thought we may get sick of the same ol' same ol' but you can really make some good combos. If interested, I saw a book for sale about different combinations sold on Amazon as well. It gets very, very hot and really cooks the egg thoroughly each time. I made the mistake of pressing it down when I got a little wild with the amount of veggies I crammed in there and this caused it to cook incorrectly. Even if it is a little bit tilted due to over packing just let it be - the egg will cook! I debated on getting the dual sandwhich maker but the dual shipping cost turned me away - I am so glad I chose this model.. even if we want to eat together, cool down time allows that. Fantastic product!

  I bought this product hoping for a simpler way to make the breakfast sandwiches my son enjoys but the end result was lacking. First, no matter what I do the egg leaks all over so you’re only left with less than half a cooked egg. The bottom English muffin turns hard as a rock if you actually want your eggs to be cooked. Another thing we didn’t like was how the egg cooked into the top muffin. Hoping to return it soon.

But I always craved those sausage mcmuffin breakfast sandwiches. So I was watching TV one day and saw that they had a mcmuffin maker! I instantly hopped on Amazon and ordered one.Definitely easy to use. Theirs a tray that you can place your egg in, and once its done you just slide the tray out and the egg will fall into a bottom layer where a muffin is at. In about 5-10 minutes you'll have a fresh egg/sausage mcmuffin ready to grub on!Easy to take apart, Easy to clean. I usually just use a wet paper towel to clean it. People always ask me if I would recommend it and I always give them a Stone Cold ""HELL YEAH!""So if you want some sausage/egg mcmuffin quality breakfast sandwiches but homemade, I would recommend this device to you as well!

  What I like: cooks the egg in a round shape. Egg doesn’t leak out of the ring.What I dislike: everything elseYou can mix and match ingredients as you please. I attempted to recreate an egg McMuffin.How it works- You put the bottom half of bread in the bottom ring. You put whatever toppings you want (meat, cheese, etc) directly on top of the bread. The problem with this is as the food cooks, the juices are absorbed by the bun which makes the bread soggy.In the top ring you crack an egg and lay the top half of bread DIRECTLY ON TOP of the raw egg. The bread sinks down into the egg and you’re left with hardly any bread sticking out on top.I don’t care for the texture of the bread either after cooking; the outside that’s pressed against the heating element almost gets too well done in the time it takes to ensure the egg is fully cooked. I HATE runny egg, my egg has to be fully cooked. If you like your eggs over easy or medium this will be less of an issue for you.I really wish the bread chambers were kept separate from the moist ingredients. Would be an easy fix to most of the issues with the device.The cheese (if you use sliced cheese) melts quickly, runs over the edges of the muffin and starts to burn on the bottom plate.It’s also hard to clean.I can’t see myself ever using this. It was supposed to be a quick easy way to make breakfast in the morning when I’m in a hurry and save me from driving through McDonald’s all the time but I’m returning it and looking for a better design.

I have used Thomas regular sized english muffins, 3.5 inch sausage patties, cheddar cheese and one egg.Be sure to spray the racks. I used olive oil on a napkin and just wiped all of the insides of the racks. I suggest putting in the english muffin bottom, then cheese, then meat. Then drop the egg rack and close the slide. Crack an egg in the rack and break the yoke. If you stir, DO NOT MOVE THE RACK IN ANY WAY.  If you do, the egg will seep out the edges of the rack. I let mine cook for two minutes and then put in the top of the muffin on top of the egg. I then let if cook for 4 more minutes.These are bigger and so much better than the arches version.

  This is literally the best thing ever. I use this EVERY morning to make a ham egg and cheese sandwich on an English muffin. It has cut my breakfast time by 500% and I can get other things done while it cooks on its own. Take some time to visualize where you want each ingredient, breads, egg, cheese, meat, and eventually you’ll be turning out sandwiches like a well oiled machine. WHICH IT IS!!!! I even used it to make my mom a sunny side up egg with flawless results. I take this on every vacation and again I use it EVERY day. I can’t even express how much I love this silly little machine, but it’s the best kitchen tool I own. Hamilton beach I LOVE YOU!

  best money I ever spent.  Super easy to use and we have done a lot with it.  Meats used bacon, Canadian Bacon, various lunch meats and chicken.  Bread used, Egg McMuffins, Bagels and Croissants.  I prefer for the egg to be complete before putting the bread on top. I just was not a fan of the egg cooking into the bread.  I will say that if you are aiming for an Egg McMuffin be sure to spread a little butter on the Egg McMuffin first and use Canadian Bacon (found in every grocery store in the ham section) and it tastes like an egg mcmuffin.  Just think, make 5 of these on your way out the door and you've already paid for it by skipping McD's.  Super easy to wash and you are only limited by your imagination.  This breakfast maker paid for itself in less than a week.  I only wish I would have gotten the double one for only a few dollars more.

    Does What It Says With Considerable Drawbacks
  
",3.0,James C. Hughes,"Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2021","









  
  
    
  This machine makes breakfast sandwiches as advertised with relative ease, but several drawbacks have me less than enthused:1) HB is big on advertising ""Breakfast sandwiches in 5 minutes!"" Of course what they don't bother to tell you is that it takes 5 mins to preheat as well, making your 5 minute sandwich into 10 minute sandwich. Not a big time saver.2) For some reason I can't explain this thing doesn't have an On/Off switch. You turn it ""on"" by plugging the AC cord into an outlet and ""off"" by unplugging the A/C cord. If your kitchen plugs are hard to access (like mine) it's a pain in the ass. Truly bizarre. Imagine having to do that with your coffee maker or microwave.3) The compartment where you put the raw egg doesn't seal properly, so some raw egg will run out all over the machine, creating a sticky cleaning nightmare.4) The large middle portion of the machine (the rings where the egg and top bread go) is not locked into the hinge system, it just sits in there. I suppose this is to make it easily removable for cleaning. The problem is that when your sandwich is done and you lift up all the rings to remove it, this part of the machine breaks free from the hinge system, slips off the base and goes flying across your kitchen counter, making for yet another fun cleanup.Make no mistake, it will make you a tasty breakfast sandwich, if you don't mind the machine and your countertop looking like the Chernobyl disaster after 10 mins.

  Since the first time I saw an ad on television for this sandwich maker, I wanted one! But I was a little hesitant after I read some of the negative reviews. There seemed to be a lot of complaints about the egg leaking out and making a huge mess, and then almost as many complaints that it doesn't cook the egg all the way or it burns the bread. However, given that the major percentage of reviews were favorable, I decided to give it a try. And this little gadget is FABULOUS!! If you follow the directions that come with it, the sandwiches turn out perfect! And it is so simple to clean. The ring assembly comes right off and cleans up easily with soap and water or in the dishwasher. Cleaning the top and bottom plates is as simple as wiping them with paper towel.I am guessing that those folks who complained of the egg leaking didn't have the cooking plate for the egg slid in all the way. And as far as burning the bread? Well, I suppose if you left in there longer than the 4-5 minutes it takes to cook...If you are like me and LOVE breakfast sandwiches, but don't have the time in the morning to cook everything separately (or just don't want to deal with the dishes!) then this is a must-have!

  My kitchen appliances are all my toys!  I love this one.  I was going to the arches 2 - 3  mornings a week for breakfast  at $6 a day.  I don't want to make any inferences on quality, but I'm pretty sure that that place that has served billions isn't using organic free range eggs, organic cheese (or even actual cheese for that matter) and humanely raised pigs for Canadian Bacon.  If they are, I certainly missed that ad campaign.  Now my breakfast sammy runs about $1 and it's not slowly killing me.  I've read the other tips -- yes preheat it.  Yes use spray (common sense really)  Put the cheese on the bottom of the muffin and take the time to make sure it's not running over, that way you can eat the cheese not clean it off the plate.  P.S.  Your sandwich is screaming hot when it comes off the machine, don't blindly bite into it.

  We use this allllllll the time. You don't necessarily have to make a sandwich each time. We use it to make a scrambled egg patty then stick it on some bread with a slice of cheese.We crack one egg in a cup and mix it up while the thing heats up. Once at temp, pour the mixed egg in the top portion of the cooker and close the lid. Cook for 5 minutes. When the time is up, slide the thing to the side so the egg patty falls to the bottom, slide it back, then open the lid. Use a fork to flick it out onto the bread on your plate.

Yup- can’t eat as a sandwich but in my opinion makes a quick sit down breakfast.** FYI: Eggs are size Large. To prevent spillage, I crack 1st egg, break yolk, let cook for 30 secs & repeat w/2nd egg. By cooking 1st egg, it forms a ‘seal’ around the metal ring, which prevents any liquid from leaking out.

  I don't know about you, but almost every time I've ordered a breakfast sandwich at a fast food emporium, they screw it up somehow.  Wrong meat, no meat, no cheese, wrong bread.  Once I was served one that was ICE COLD; they actually forgot to heat it up for me!So, it's often true that if you want something done right, you have to do it yourself.  But if it's too complicated to do, you won't bother doing it.  That's where this nifty little gadget comes in.  It's so easy to use, even my culinarily-challenged husband can do it.  Yes, if you use meat in this thing, it needs to be pre-cooked.  Sure, you can buy pre-cooked bacon and sausage at the store, but you can save money by buying it raw and cooking up enough for the whole week all at once over the weekend, to save time on weekday mornings.  Canadian bacon is sold already cooked and works well, as does ham.  You're not limited to the usual ""Egg McMuffin"" thing, the possibilities are endless.  If you buy this gadget, you should also consider getting at least one of the cookbooks that were written for it.  I especially like

No more waiting in line at the fast food drive-through for a sandwich that they may or may not screw up, and it will cost less, too.  You control exactly what goes into it.I took the advice of other reviewers here and sprayed the cooking surfaces lightly with cooking spray.  The food did not stick and make a goopy mess, and that made the thing easy to clean.  The removable inside part can be put in the dishwasher, but it's easy enough to just wipe it clean.Highly recommended!

  I find it surprising to stumble upon this item again and see how good the reviews are. I’ve had this product for quite some time now. It makes a decent sandwich at best. The egg will always spill over. You can’t fit that many ingredients at all, and when you do the top won’t close down all of the way. The egg takes longer to cook on the center part than the English muffins themselves take, which always leads to over crispy/hard English muffins. Just my take on this product.

  I love Egg McMuffins but buying several each week can get pricey (I live in NYC where everything is more expensive). This makes a great substitute at a fraction of the cost. It also gives great range of choice as to ingredients. I use different types of English muffins, different types of cheese and regular or canadian bacon. I've even scrambled the egg and that also works. It's easy to use and the non-stick surface is easy to clean. It is also fast. I preheat while gathering the ingredients and let it cook for 4 minutes (I found that the 5 minutes in the instructions tends to overcook the egg but that's a matter of taste).  That's faster than when I buy an Egg McMuffin at McDonald's and I don't have to make the trip. I use it two to three times a week and am very satisfied with it.

For $25 bucks delivered via Prime, It's an amazingly good deal too.  I have not tried bagel sandwiches yet or done anything super fancy but for the basic English muffin sandwiches, this gadget is the best.  They come out perfect every time if you do a quick spritz of olive oil spray.  I have no spill over and if you are careful, cleaning the contraption is very easy.  It has a very small footprint in the cupboard and on the counter. I found that if you time the cooking to 4 minutes instead of 5, you will get an egg yolk that is barely set but cooked through.  Very nice.  5 minutes gives you one that's firm but not seared brown.  I also learned quickly that there is a lot of steam generated so I will set a timer for 2 minutes more on my plate or paper towel before I attempt to eat it.  Comes out steaming hot!

  Man oh man. Where to begin? There is serious room for improvement with the design of this thing. First of all, the egg compartment is a joke. The whole thing is wobbly, loose and cheap feeling. The part where you put the egg doesn't seal so the egg leaks out everywhere and all over everything. Secondly, the plates that are supposed to toast the bread get way too hot (there is no temperature control) and burn the s*** out of the bread while barely warming the middle of the sandwich. The only type of bread that fits in this thing is a smaller english muffin. Don't bother with bagels or toast. It won't fit. If it's too thick, it won't close and if it's too wide it won't fit. The quality of this thing sucks over all. For 25 bucks plus tax I expected it to be sturdy at the very least but it feels like it going to fall apart in my hands. Very wobbly like the screws that hold the pieces together are loose or something. I want to return this crap honestly. I've only used it once and it was an awful experience so I hope I'm still able to after using this pos. Talk about a design flaw. Yikes. Save your money and buy something else. Oh and one more thing...there is NO timer on this model like they falsely advertise in the video. You just have to guess when your sandwich is done.

Third thought was eh, it's worth a shot. At the end of the gift swap I ended up with the breakfast sandwich maker. It came in a plain cardboard box without a product image on it, so it didn't jump out from the rest of the gifts. Walked away content, but couldn't help but wonder if I'd bought myself a flop. Fired it up the next morning and can honestly say it made a believer out of me from the first sandwich. English muffins, meat, and cheese get warmed appropriately, not burnt. Eggs cook to a nice breakfast sandwich worthy patty. After several months I have not had a bad looking sandwich come out of it. Nothing has been undercooked or burnt. I follow the instructions and make sure I spray it with pam before each use. Cleaning it is not a 2 second task and yes, you have to cook one sandwich at a time. But they take 5 minutes each. I don't take offense if my wife has gobbled hers down already by the time mine comes out. The egg part is really what seals the deal for me. Rather get the full sandwich going on here than cook the egg separately on a pan. Plus it comes out in a nice neat stack if you're careful. Definitely recommend, it's a nice little novelty to have around in the morning!

  love the product.  takes a few times to make sure you don't burn yourself.  make sure your swing lid for the egg is back to closed position when lifting up for taking food out.  other wise it pulls out of the holder and you will get burned.other than that we are loving it and my husband and i are up at 3 and 4 AM for our jobs so it makes it hard to cook that early, this has made things quick and easy.  only wish i knew i had to pay an additional $15 for the timer.  the same video is used on both products with and with out timer.

  I received one of the many emails from Amazon and saw this product. I was hoping it would fill a need for a quick and healthy breakfast. I like 7 grain sprouted muffins and egg substitute. Those muffins are too thick. Using regular muffins it seems to work better for me to put the first muffin in, then pour a little egg on top of it, then slide close the lid and put the 2nd muffin in the top section. But doing it that way the egg doesn't get done before the muffin starts to burn. Putting the egg on the sliding lid then putting the muffin on top of that, there doesn't seem to be enough room in the top section. This may sound confusing unless you have one of these. It would work better I think if you could flip the hinged section over , but it is made in away that  you can't. It does heat up quickly and is very well made..I had no problem with sticking. The non-stick surface is durable.  I am going to continue to cook the egg in it but go back to my sprouted muffins in the toaster.

",4.0,Connie M Blowers.,"Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2014","









  
  
    
  I am glad that I bought this simple appliance.  Once I learned what ingredients that I like in my sandwich, it's easy to have my ingredients ready to pop in the machine in the morning.  I found that I don't like the raw egg cooked into the bread top, so I put the scrambled egg on the top area of the cooker and shut the lid for 1/2 of the cooking time.  Then I add the cheese and bread top for the last minute or minute and 1/2.  My husband liked the whole egg and bread cooking  together  ( which is the way the instructions say)You must have your meat pre cooked, but that really isn't a problem.I prepare the scrambled egg and leave it in a small bowl in the fridge overnite, then put my choice of meat and a small slice of cheese in a small plastic bag along side the egg in the fridge. It becomes a quick process in the morning.  I plug in the until about 5 minutes before I am ready to leave for the day.  When the ready lite comes on all I need is to put the ingredients in the preheated sandwich in the manner I described. About 4 minutes later I am going out the door with a warm sandwich tightly wrapped in a napkin and ready to enjoy on my ride to work.  Better quality and faster than going thru a fast food drive through.My choice of bread  = small bagels.  Watch the size before you buy.  The average size bagel won't fit.Regular sized English muffins do fit.  Thank you Hamilton Beach for this good idea.

    it's pretty much foolproof
  
",5.0,Ian Catchpole,"Reviewed in the United States July 10, 2014","









  
  
    
  I wasn't 100% sure when I ordered this but I figured at this price ($24) it was low risk. Well I have to say it does everything they said and if you follow some of the many tips that people have posted, it's pretty much foolproof. I use it several times a week and even with my hectic morning routine (I prefer to spend the time sleeping if I can) it is easily accomodated.Specific: Muffins definitely work best, but also flatbread sandwich buns, thin bagels and (to a degree) croissants, all work. Larger bagels don't work so well - you have to trim and they are still really too thick for everything to work.My normal breakast is pre-cooked sausage patties (usually have to trim and use two if they are store bought precooked), or canadian bacon. I like prcoessed/American cheese slices (tip: fold the corners in so they are contained within the muffin or cheese may melt all out the sides). I use a spray olive oil for the egg section (don't skip this - it really keeps everything cleaner and helps stop egg leaks) with a little cracked pepper.My routine is heat-up (often for longer that required but I get better results if I don't immediately use it when the green light comes). Bottom Muffin, cheese, meat, close that section, crack the egg, season, drop the lid and set timer for 4:30 (I find that's enough if you really let it warm up first). I prefer to leave the top muffin off till there's a minute to go (so it doesn't soak up the egg).Unplug, open, slide out the egg pan, and just lift the whole ring section off, leaving the muffin behind. Then slide off with a spatula. Since time is at a premium for me in the mornings, I just leave the ring section in the sink and clean up in the evening. A quick wipe is all it needs.Other hints:  I've tried using Avocado (made everything too slippery), tuna and cheese (trying to make a eggy tuna melt - jury is out on that one!). I sometimes add a little chopped onion with the egg - that works. Just don't overdo the cheese - it can get messy.All in all - well worth the cost - and still healthier that a McMuffin.

  This worked great—for about a month! Then what should take 5mins to cook the sandwich turned in to much longer and it does not have an all around cook now. After 5mins now the egg is runny and undercooked, which didn’t used to be the case. This all happened within a week of the return date and I submitted an inquiry for a replacement item through Hamilton Beach and have yet to hear back since their phone lines are down due to the pandemic. I would happily change my review once Hamilton Beach follows up as Amazon stated they should due to it being under warranty. It was a great product until it started working inefficiently.

  This unit does all it says and more. It is quicker than any other type cooking method I have used. It is quick, efficient and easy to clean up. What is really nice is a heated smaller sandwich that has a toasted type crusty taste. You don't need a recipe book, just let your imagination be your guide. The meat heats up, the cheese melts and the bun toasts and if you want an egg just put it in. I have used it about 50 times so far with no issues, even heating a half burrito and sort of a folded type quesadilla. It takes no time to load it up with goodies. It sort of has been dietetic for me as I make a smaller sandwich without butter and mayo and the heat and toasted bun just make the sand  yummy. I have used this thing to cook and use all sorts of left overs as sandwich fillers. I also have found the cheaper buns at like Vons or Safeway, you know the 8 for $.99, fit it perfectly, so do the economy English muffins. By the time you put everything with it you have a toasted hot sandwich for under a quarter. I do find you are better of in regards to keeping the cleaning to a minimum by keeping you sandwich fillers, meat, cheese, etc. to the size of the bun, and if you want tomatoes peppers or whatever, add them towards the end so the juice doesn't run all over. Another positive, no dirty egg pans, no splatters in the microwave covers. It is a cool speedy kitchen tool. One warning though, do not touch any metal part of it until it cools as she does get hot!

  This little sandwich maker is one of the best kitchen appliances to own. We all buy the latest and greatest gadgets...juice makers, waffle irons, sandwich makers, (remember bread makers?) etc. only to stuff them in the cupboard after the novelty wears off. I don't see that happening with this. It's functional, small, simple to use, and makes great sandwiches. There is a bit of a learning curve to find the right size bread (not all bagels are created equal), and the right meat, but that's to be expected. We mostly use Thomas English muffins because we like them and they are the perfect fit and just get ham, Canadian bacon and precooked bacon and sausage for the meat. What I like most is because it is so simple to use it actually gets used.

  Worst kitchen appliance I have ever purchased.  I found it difficult to use.  Extremely hot and must be very careful when removing finished product.  Did not add a lot to it and yet it still spilled on counter and the unit itself.  When swinging out the center part so the muffin can fall down on other items; the steam was way too hot.  Also the top muffin did not fall down onto the rest of the sandwich  Had to remove manually; and the unit is extremely hot.  Thought too easily to get burned.  Not worth it.  Sorry I bought it.

  You do have to have your ingredients prepared ahead of time. That means precooked meat, thawed muffins, etc. I started the heat on the sandwich maker, then I got everything out of the frig. By the time that the machine was heated, my ingredients were optimum for the machine. I used Thomas muffin, canadian bacon, shredded cheddar cheese and an egg.When the machine was heated, I put in everything but the top of the muffin. I let the egg cook for about three minutes, then put the muffin top in. I then let it cook for about another three minutes. I took the sandwich out of the machine, and there was very little sticking. I did not spray or use any oils on the machine first.And then, deliciousness. This makes a really tasty sandwich. Due to the protein ingredients, it is also very filling.

  The device works well but there is a gap between the sliding plate and upper ring where the egg goes.

I have to put a paper towel on the counter then the sandwich maker on that so that I do not get egg whites all over the counter.

  We LOVE this sandwich maker!  We just used if for the first time to make breakfast sandwiches for lunch today.  It worked PERFECT!!  Read the instructions first so that you know what to pre-wash and what to spray with non-stick cooking spray.Here's what we did: we put the bottom half of an English muffin in the bottom, topped that with grated cheddar cheese, and topped the cheese with some deli honey ham.  On the egg plate (which you make sure is pushed in all the way) we cracked an egg and poked the yoke with a toothpick, kind of moving the yoke around so it would spread out a little.  We closed the lid and set a timer for 1 minute.  We then opened it and added the top of the English muffin, closed it and set time for 3 minutes.  When done, the egg plate slid out easily, looking completely clean.  Our breakfast sandwich was PERFECT!  I wish I would have taken a picture.  We then made a 2nd one, but had a slight issue.  This time we added a just little too much cheese.  The instructions clearly say not to overfill.  Maybe we overfilled a bit too much with cheese.  The cheese oozed out a little bit and made just a few slightly burned areas under the bottom muffin.  If you are using the single unit to make more than one, keep in mind that by the time you make the second one the unit is much hotter and maybe won't require the full 4 minutes.  This is so simple to use, and super easy to clean up, both of which is what I wanted so my daughter could make a sandwich for breakfast or lunch all by herself.  We are very happy with this and would highly recommend it!One more thing I want to mention is that I read a review that said the instructions say not to use egg whites.  It says not to use store-bought egg whites (like a carton of Egg Beaters)....take an actual egg, use an egg separator, and use those egg whites.  Just wanted to clear that up that egg whites can be used.

You just drop it into some warm soapy water and wipe it off and you are good to go.You can even make a kind of  tiny quiche or souffle on this device by just adding a bit of ice cold water to the eggs when you whip them..

  I purchased the Hamilton Beach breakfast sandwich maker for my son-in-law as I had already purchased one for my husband and when my son-in-law saw how easy it was to use, and better yet, how delicious the sandwich was (and made in 4 minutes) he immediately wanted one; therefore, I ordered him one for Christmas.  My husband absolutely loves his.  His breakfast sandwich is ready in 4 minutes and it looks beautiful when finished.  I eat yogurt; however, I must say, it makes me hungry just to look at it.  It is so nifty!  The egg cooks beautifully and sizes up with the remainder of the sandwich (he uses egg, sausage (he cooks and freezes) and Trader Joe English Muffins!  It is so easy.  I really impressed me and it impressed my son-in-law, daughter, and me!

  I ordered this little breakfast maker since I hoped it would help my hubby make an easier breakfast for himself.  It works, but it does not seem to have a timer on it or change light colors when the sandwich is done.  My hubby said that he needs to keep opening it to see if the egg is done.  I guess it does what it should, but it seems that a light or timer would make it even better and easier to use.

  This works great.. have tried it using english muffins, biscuits and today, bread cut into rounds.  It is easy to use, cleans up with a paper towel and makes very tasty sandwiches.I think there is a potential that you couldt  get a burn off of the sides of it when your lifting the top, but I was just very careful and had no issues, I probably would not let a child lift the top.In case you wonder, it cooks the egg perfectly and I used large eggs... the machine cooke them well  and toasts the breads well.. if you have to thick of a piece of bread, bun or muffin...it can burn so I sitck to slightly flatter muffins or today I used bread cut into a round and it came out perfect...  I tried a home made biscuit the other day but it was to thick and the top got a little burned.. but all in all I am completely satisfied with the product.

  A year ago I lived in a hotel room without a kitchen and used this daily for 6 months. Now I use it once a week when I need my McMuffin fix, and it has definitely paid for itself for this reason. It works today just like it did when I got it and the non-stick coating has't worn off. I have washed pieces that come off with hot water and a little bit of dawn over the year, and just wiped down the rest of it with a rag. During dishwashing there hasn't been a need to scrub anything off (unless I burn cheese on it) because of the non-stick coating. The food cooks quickly enough that it doesn't take too long to cook two or three at a time for a warm-up lunch for later. I would recommend this to someone who likes fast food but wants to budget better or make healthier choices, as well as someone who doesn't have a conventional kitchen to cook in and wants something hot that isn't a microwaved meal.

  My daughter won this item (that we bought) as a white elephant gift.  This machine is very easy to you and makes great breakfast sandwiches.  I had 2 concerns before using... 1)  Would the eggs leak?  2)  How difficult would it be to clean up?  I'm happy to report that the eggs cook wonderfully (and don't leak) and that it's a breeze to clean.  The inside ring detaches to sink cleanup and you can simply wipe off the two other elements.  For the price, this is great!

    Get it, totally worth $25. Pro tips below...
  
",4.0,J. Waltzer,"Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2016","









  
  
    
  This gadget is totally worth $25. It basically pays for itself with less than about a dozen sandwiches and  so far everything has come out delicious.  Enjoy the pro tips below:Pro Tip 1:  do not add anything besides salt and pepper to the egg.  The images show the egg  placed directly on the cookie tray but I've had much better results with scrambling the eggs first in a separate bowl. DO NOT  add milk or anything else to the egg as it will overflow the cooking tray and make a mess.Pro Tip 2:  plug the unit in to preheat while prepping your ingredients and when the green light turns on you are ready to add your ingredients to the cooker -  the instructions are not very clear about this. After you add all your ingredients close the lid and set a separate timer for five minutes.  After five minutes slide out the egg cooking tray, open the top and use a spatula to hold down the top part while also pulling up the remaining part of the machine -  this can be a little tricky but you will figure it out, be careful not to burn yourself.Prp Tip 3:  I have found English muffins seem to work the best - experiment with different types like double protein, extra fiber, blueberry or cranberry.

  Well, isn't this little thing impressive for what it does.  Made my first breakfast in it (at my desk at work...I'm sure this is illegal at work, but many things are). I've been spending $4 at Starbucks every morning for a year (!) and switched to Jimmy Dean Delights at over $1 each (without a coupon)...this lets me make exactly what I want for breakfast with just an egg, English muffin and whatever protein we have in the fridge in just  few minutes at my desk.I'm a much happier person when I get breakfast and have tried cold breakfasts, but it's not the same as a warm, crunchy BEC muffin.  I think it's a keeper and at $24 it's sold.  The model with the timer would be nice, but I'm cheep and I can manage to set a timer on my watch if it's that critical.<3  the sandwich maker!

Split your English muffin,, place the stack on the bottom one. Plug in your sandwich maker. Get the egg out, some salt, pepper, Parmesan  cheese, beat with a fork. When the light turns green, give it about another 30 seconds or a minute.  Open up, put the meat cheese stack in the bottom, close center section, pour in egg, put top English on, close up. Say ""Hey Google, set a timer for four and one half minutes. Perfect breakfast sandwich.. I precut the cheese and meet stacks and keep them in a container in the fridge. A++

Some deli ham with half a cheese slice and some jalapenos on top.  An egg cracked on the plate with the yoke intact.Someone is outside of my office door right now ""What's that...

  This thing can barely fit half a regular sized bagel. The workflow they suggest has you sitting the top bread in uncooked egg. It should really have a top compartment for the bread to cook separately that then drops onto the cooked egg, that drops onto the cooked lower piece of bread. It's also very shallow. A small sausage pattie on top of the lower bagel makes this thing bulge and not work right. Now I'm just using this to cook the egg into a nice shape, I'll cook the other ingredients separately

It takes about 4 minutes to preheat which gives you enough time to get your ingredients ready and about 4 minutes to cook. Use very little cooking spray.

    The PERFECT Breakfast Sandwich!
  
",5.0,Julia Snow,"Reviewed in the United States May 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  I am absolutely thrilled with this machine!  I read a lot of the reviews first, and took their recommendation to let the egg cook a little bit before adding the top muffin/bagel/etc. Usually 2-3 minutes without the muffin, then another 2 with the muffin.  Cooks perfectly!  And it is SO easy.  If you're using sliced cheese you have to ""fold"" in the corners to make them fit, but that's no big deal - haven't tried it with shredded cheese yet, but I feel like that might be a little messy.  I cook up a pound of bacon in the oven on the weekends so it's always available, so with this machine I just grab a piece of bacon and split it in 3 pieces and put it on the sammich and voila! A perfect bacon, egg and cheese sammich that blows McDonald's away!  It's very easy to clean - I spray Pam Butter Spray on the egg plate only - nothing sticks at all.  Usually I just wipe the whole thing down with a damp paper towel once it's cooled, but I've also removed the ""innards"" and washed them in the sink with no problems.  The only negative is that there's no on/off switch and no timer ... you plug it in to turn it on and vice versa to turn it off, and I have to use my phone to time it.  Other than that ... absolutely thrilled with this purchase!

I went to the manufacturer website and printed the owners manual.The only problem I had was with the first egg I cooked, the whites stuck to the slide plate a little. I learned to use a little nonstick spray first.works with Canadian bacon well. This morning I used sliced sandwich ham and cheddar. A little messy, but turned out well. Let the egg cook all the way before you top with cheese. I added mine a little early.Preheat time isnt too long (2-4 min).This cooker is good for on the run and dont want to make a big production. I plan on trying a bagel (pre-toast) and pre cooked sausage patties.

  This product is absolutely everywhere. Amazon, Target, Walmart, Marshall's and it is an absolute joy to own.When i purchased my first one for the Dorm room it was a gimmick and a joke. Little did i know i was going to be running my very own short order diner when it came to playing FiFA with the boys or having late night Netflix and BEC's.It has been stolen countless times and I have replaced it twice. During the periods of when the Glorious Hamilton Beach Breakfast Sandwich Maker was stolen it was some of my lowest times. I moved out of the state of New Jersey because if i couldn't represent my home with its state sandwich then what else could the great NJ offer to me. I rented an apartment in Bushwick to try and forget my troubles.Eventually the Stolen Machines made it back and I now have the firepower to feed a room of 15 in about 30 minutes.I couldn't be happier.Many people say you don't know how many friends you have until you win the lottery.I don't think people know what its like in college when you are known as the guy with the BEC (Bacon Egg and Cheese for the uninitiated) maker and inflatable hot tubI also purchased a few of these for White elephant Christmas and they were the absolute most stolen items during those get togethers.

  Alton Brown might hate your existence, little breakfast sandwich maker, but I adore you.I use mine a lot, especially to make a quick breakfast to go for me and for the one other person leaving the house (to eat in the car on the way to work), but I can see how this could easily end up in a cabinet next to the waffle maker, juicer, tortilla warmer, banana slicer, cat food crisper, water dryer, lettuce shaper. If I had to make sandwiches for a family or for a gaggle of whiny kids I'd say no way. Now, maybe if I had the TWO-AT-A-TIME version...It also can be a bit unwieldy and it's easy to burn oneself, but not only am I willing to suffer a little bit for my breakfast, I have developed a system so I don't get burned or make a mess with escaping ingredients. I also LOVE egg and cheese sandwiches on English muffins, so as long as that holds true I'm loyal to my maker.

  Bought this for my husband as he likes McDonald's sausage McMuffin with egg. He precooks a sausage patty and then will place in sandwich maker which takes approx 5 minutes to warm up. Add 1 large egg to cook along with an english muffin. When the light comes back on, the sandwich usually is done.

  Bought this because I love me some breakfast sandwiches and being able to cook it all at once seemed awesome. Bought it and tried it out 3 times. First of all it's super flimsy, so the slightest touch knocks the hot ass plates off and onto you or your counter. Second I use egg whites because I am dieting and they're super low calorie. Apparently the instructions tell you NOT to use egg whites.... I tried it anyway and it leaked EVERYWHERE. In the troubleshooting portion it says if it leaks use a different brand of egg whites. Same issue. Used a regular egg. Same issue. Third you can only use small english muffins or mini bagels, which is ok for me but alot of people want a bigger sandwich. It's also a bitch to clean. Really disappointed. Will be returning.

    Love this thing! Review with a few helpful hints!

  So I got an email about this maker from Amazon so I decided to check it out. The reviews are great so I figured I would give it a try and made my daughter in law try it as well (bought hers in red). I love this thing! Thanks to a lot of the reviews we already new what to do and not do. So off to the store I went and bought pork sausage, bacon, bagels, small hamburger buns, cheese and eggs. Went home and broke out the griddle and fried all of the bacon and sliced up the whole roll of the sausage (made very thin 4"" circles to fit the whole sandwich). Plugged in the machine and waited for it to heat up, sprayed it down once heated. Put the bottom bagel, cheese and bacon in the bottom well. Closed the first section down and put the egg (salt and peppered it then took a tooth pick and semi scrambled the egg) put the top bagel in and closed the lid. Well the bagel was what to big and the egg over flowed. Even though I din't press it down. So my very first sandwich was a mess. A very delicious mess and so worth it. So by now my son has woken up and wants to try one so he made his with the small hamburger buns and they were the perfect size, no over flow.So to make everything easier I went and shaved a little off of each bagel to kill the over flow, works perfect now!Since we are a busy household I have created individual meals that are frozen so that no matter how many people are there eating we can all have home cooked meals. So I thought why should breakfast be any different, so I got my baggies out and put 1 bread (bagel (cut down) or hamburger bun) 1 meat (my precooked bacon or sausage that I just fried) 1 piece of cheese (sliced cheese that I have cut into 4ths) and put them in the freezer. These work perfectly frozen just take them out and put them into the machine once preheated. So now I have 14 ready to go sandwiches in the freezer that anyone can just take out and have a hot sandwich in 10 minutes. I see that people freeze eggs all of the time but I just can't do it, besides eggs last for a month or so so we just keep those in the fridge.One other thing I have learned is the top heating element is very hot. so I wait 3 minutes to put the top bread in. So once I salt and pepper the egg and scramble the egg I close the lid and wait 3 minutes then put the top bread in otherwise it was coming out a little burnt.My daughter in law and son also love theirs!I am here to buy another one because the first one was supposed to be for work but I took it home to practice with and my youngest son has claimed it and makes sandwiches every morning.

  I thought I was through buying kitchen gadgets until I saw this. I used to love grabbing a breakfast muffin when I was out but was often frustrated that I could only have them at certain hours. Now I can have one anytime I want, made any way I want it and it is fresh!Just heat it up, and put your desired ingredients in the maker and minutes later you are eating a wonderful sandwich. No having to cook things separately and with a turn of a handle, the sandwich is assembled for you!It is easy to clean, easy to use, and fun for the whole family. It also comes with great ideas for different sandwiches.This was my Christmas present to myself and I couldn't be happier.

  I bought this as a Christmas present for my boyfriend. We love to get breakfast sandwiches on Saturday mornings, but the cost adds up fast. This machine is a life saver! We use it at least twice a week. You only need to spray it with oil or butter every couple of times you use it. The best results with 4.5 minutes! Mini bagels, crossants, english muffins, bread, sausage - it can use it all! I always make sure to break the yolk and mix it with the whites. Best purchase and I would highly recommend!! Easy and fast breakfast sandwich.

    Great Sandwich Maker

  Got this a few weeks ago and I love it. Works just as advertised. Very simple to use too. Makes sandwiches within minutes.  Only drawback is I wish the “handles” were cool to the touch.  Depending on the thickness of your potholders, it take a little coordination to open after cooking. The cooking plates rest on a hinge. Sometimes when I have lifted up on the plates to remove the sandwich, they plates fall off the hinge and onto the counter or floor. Lift up slowly and you will be fine. Otherwise, a great product.4/22/20. Update. This is one of the best things I’ve ever bought.  I use it a lot. This makes great sandwiches.  I also bought the single sandwich maker to take to our cabin. I highly recommend in purchasing this product.Note:  Another reviewer said it was not good at cooking sausages. I disagree.  Reviewer didn’t go into detail but I never had an issue.  Now any meat you use must be precooked. It will not cook raw meat. When I used precooked frozen sausage patties, I did put it in the microwave for about 30 seconds to thaw it out. When I then used it for the sandwich the sausage came out hot.

  This is an amazing kitchen gadget that simply works every time.The first one went to college with my son. He used to eat frozen breakfast sandwiches, which were none too healthy. He love this and uses it regularly for a healthier breakfast. The beauty of this device for a college student is it comes apart easily (see photo) and simply wipes clean.After using his several times I received one for my birthday. I've used it for breakfast and lunch.Tip #1: Be sure to spray with a cooking oil at least the first few times you use it. Your egg will stick if you don't do this. It seems to get ""seasoned"" after a while so that cooking oil is not needed all of the time.Tip #2: Use English muffins. Yes, biscuits will work, but english muffins fit perfectly and honestly seem to taste the best when warmed in this device.Tip #3: Use any leftover meat you have. I've sliced up grilled pork, beef and baked chicken. Ham is especially delicious.

    Winner Winner- BRINNER Dinner
  
",5.0,Anita Gift,"Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2013","









  
  
    
  I feel like my breakfast world has been revolutionized with this gadget! I read a lot of the reviews about this product before I purchased it and decided to just go for it. My husband and I sometimes spend $20+ on breakfast sandwiches a week on our drive into work. I got this around Thanksgiving and I was soooo excited to try it out that I could not wait until the next morning to try it. That night we had breakfast sandwiches for dinner... They were amazing. I put turkey and italian truffle cheese in mine and I felt like I was the first person in history who invented breakfast for all of mankind.Other reviewers reported issues with the eggs leaking out and I did find that if I tried to make my sandwich too magical the eggs would leak a tiny bit. For example I put the muffin on the bottom with thicker sliced cheese, 2 slices of canadian bacon and a small, unfrozen, turkey sausage patty. I then put the egg in the egg circle with more cheese with the muffin top and when I closed the top a little bit spilled out. No big deal- it cooked to the outside rim and I just wiped it off when I was done cooking my sandwich. Only 1 egg is needed to the sandwich- 2 could make it leak as well. I keep a shot glass of toothpicks near the maker so I can poke the yolk and just put in the compost with the shells.I loved this product so much that I bought one for my sister for her birthday and one for my secret santa at work! On day 1 of secret santa I wrapped up a can of Pam olive oil spray and left it on this desk. Day 2 I drew a smiley face and put a mini Santa hat on an egg. (I realized in knick of time that secret santa should tell him the egg wasn't hard boiled- I heard he was planning to crack it on his desk and eat it as a snack- that would have been messy...but pretty funny) On day 3 I gave him 1 english muffin in a ziplock bag with a Fancy bow. On reveal day he came in to find the beautiful sandwich maker with a big bow on his desk! He was so excited and once he found out I was the gift giver I gave the office a demo on how to use it like I was on an infomercial. And when I said ""Clean up is a Snap!"" I really meant it. He loved the gift!The only thing I would change is that it does not have an automatic shut off.  On my hour commute to work I couldn't remember if I had shut off the device and visions of burning down my new house were dancing in my head. I went home a little later to find that I did unplug it. But now I do something out of the ordinary when unplugging it so I remember that I unplugged it- Sometimes it is touching my nose 5 times or doing a shimmey while saying ""I am the Goddess of Breakfast""

  This thing works great! I had been microwaving my morning egg and shoving it between an English Muffin toasted in my toaster. Unfortunately though, sometimes the egg explodes and leaves egg white sparkles all over my microwave. This takes some time to clean up.  I went to Amazon and came across this product, and such a low price. I ordered.This morning I cooked my first egg sandwich. It turned out perfectly. No learning curve. It is better than the microwaved egg and super easy to use. Bonus. It is very small. Takes up little counter space.

  It works great. The sandwiches are quick, easy, and delicious! Cleaning is easy. I shorted it one star however because the way the product is presented in the illustrations lead me to believe you could use it with pancakes and what not. That's slightly true but you must use store-bought, pre-made pancakes that might fit? I haven't tried this yet and may be a little over critical in this case but I don't feel it's quite as versatile as they would have you believe. That said it seems to be a great product and if you're in the market I assume you'll be very happy with this item.

  I ordered this breakfast sandwich maker for my boyfriend as an early Christmas present after he mentioned wanting one earlier in the year. It is a great, small kitchen gadget that is easy to use, and it takes up very little kitchen and cupboard space. The heated plates on the gadget get EXTREMELY hot, and the top plastic on my product ended up getting melted. That is the only reason for my 3 star review. For something that gets super super hot, you would think they would make it from a material that withstands the heat a little better, as to not become a fire hazard. Overall, I am satisfied with the product, but I will be returning it, to get a new one.

  It works fine BUT, an english muffin is just a bit too small so the egg runs over a little. A thin bagel is pretty good - a little tight squeeze and it fits in. Bread is square so that's out. And, it's a pain to clean. The egg gets stuck in the little cracks and you'll need a toothbrush to get it all out. I do like how you can quickly assemble your sandwich and walk away for 4-5 minutes until it's done. You don't have to stand over it but be sure to set your timer!

  I'm not sure why they didn't put a timer on this that beeps when the sandwich is ready.  Other than that it is a fun appliance.  You can throw together a breakfast sandwich very quickly.  I've made them with pancakes, English muffins, and even frozen waffles.  I've used regular sausage, veggie sausage, eggs, and Egg Beaters, and all versions have turned out well.  My personal preference is to wait a minute or so before putting the top bun on so that the egg cooks a bit before (otherwise the egg will cook into the bun).  I also like to put the cheese on about a minute before the sandwich is done, otherwise I find that the cheese makes a mess.

  The sandwich maker literally fell apart the first time it was used on its first sandwich. Followed directions diligently. Loading it required using mitts due to the very hot handles, and removing the sandwich was mightily difficult. The plates were extremely hot and I had to lift each one independently in order to get the sandwich out. My guess is that the item was broken to start with and springs were missing that would ease the process of loading and removing. What a waste of money.

  I wanted to try this because of the appeal of a quick breakfast with a quarter of the fat of a drive thru. I plugged it in on a Saturday and waited for it to preheat. And waited, and waited, and waited. Waited about 25 minutes for the green light to flip on. Never happened. So I just made a sandwich the conventional way and took about 15 minutes.I may try it again but right now it seems like a ridiculously slow way to do something that is pretty fast and easy. The design also seems problematic. I didn’t get to the part where you put anything in the machine but I can totally see how it could leak.May try it again but probably just going to chuck it. I wouldn’t buy it. These reviews don’t match the products

  It is small and comes packaged in a small box, but it's HUGE in possibilities for quick and easy breakfast sandwiches. We first bought one for our daughter and son-in-law, but they liked it so much we bought one for ourselves. It's easy to store, actually does what it says it will do, and comes in very handy for any meal of the day, especially a late dinner when we don't want a big meal.I think someone else commented on not being able to fit a bagel into the unit. If not, I'll say it -- bagels don't fit. That has been the only disappointment and easily gotten over with the great variety of English muffins available.

  My kids love this little thing. We've only had it a few days, but they've used it a lot already, trying out different combinations. It toasts really well, doesn't get so hot that we worry about severe burns, and it cooks well. Only complaint is that a bit of the raw egg oozes out every single time because of how it's made. We put a little metal tray beneath it to keep that of the counter, but I wish they'd improve the design to fix this.

  This is seriously my favorite thing in my kitchen. Considering I purchased this a year ago and I still feel this way, is saying something about this must have kitchen appliance. I love it so much, I even gifted it to 2 others and they mention how much they love it as well. This allows for me to make a yummy egg sandwich especially on my many rush mornings. I’ll get up in a hurry and plug it in (which automatically turns it on). I’ll then only need maybe 30sec until the green light turns on which allows me to quickly grab an egg, and the basics for the sandwich/es I plan to make. Place the bottom bread/cheese/meat options. Drop top part of sandwich maker where I crack the egg and place top bread. Close lid and wait maybe 4-5 min. If I can lift the top bread and the egg releases easy than I know it’s done. All in all, I average 7min per sandwich. This has saved me so much time on last min meal options like late work shifts or when you just want to go home and eat something decent but not spend 30min preparing. Highly recommend for those on the go, busy households, singles or couples, or simply just egg lovers (let’s just say, I recommend every kitchen should have one haha). I would seriously shake the first person’s hand who came up w this invention if I had the option haha. Clearly I’m a fan of this device 😂

  Why I like my amazing sandwich makerIt's easy.  If you are struggling to get out the door this is you go to breakfast.  I  turn it on. Grab my coffee mug make myself a cup of coffee with my other favorite device in my kitchen. My keurig. Then I grab all the ingredients I need for my Sammy. English muffin bread choice here is critical. You can't use trader joes bc it's too thick. I was using Thomas which was great until I banned Thomas since they put  Azodicarbonamide in their bread. Now finally found sprouts organic English muffins toast crispy and are awesome. Food for thought. That's also in mcdonalds egg mcmuffin. Which of course would be why you need to take the five minutes to make your own sandwich with ingredients you put together.  Clean up is simple. My only room for improvement would be an auto off feature as I accidentally forgot to unplug it and left it on all day. Like I said I'm not always on my a game first thing in the morning!!!  Haha. Anyways I highly recommend the product bc of its ease and the way I get a perfectly cooked egg every time and the muffin is always perfectly toasted and the sandwich is steaming hot. So it's still warm by the time I get to the car to take my first bite!  Enjoy!

  Breakfast has never been so friggen easy!! I now have a morning routine. First thing, plug it in to turn it on, I defrost my sausage patty in the microwave for 30 seconds , cut English muffin in half, pull an egg out of the fridge, and pour my cup of coffee. *CLICK* the light goes green, time to throw in the goods. English muffin on the bottom, sprinkle some feta on it, place the sausage patty on top of the feta, close the middle section down, crack an egg in the egg section, toss the top of the English muffin on top of the egg, close the lid. Turn timer for 4 and a half minutes, go and start my car to let it warm up, and by the time i'm back my breakfast is ready. Pop my delicious and perfectly cooked breakfast sandwich out, unplug the machine,........ ohh yeahhhh all done. From start to finish I have warmed my car made my breakfast and am out the door in LESS than ten minutes. Best of all nothing really to clean before I go. The center section is very easily and quickly cleaned with dinners dishes and ready to go for my next morning.  I like this thing so much I purchased two more of these units for my brother and my father. Their feed back is the same as mine.  I  would call this a kitchen necessity!!

  Makes easy and excellent breakfast sandwiches. I drop everything in right after starting my morning coffee and they are both ready at the same time. Wish they had an option to buy larger cylinder sizes for other breads(bagels).One of my favorite recipes is to make a sort of frittata sandwich. I cook the muffin top alone for a few minutes because the egg compartment will be too full. Set the muffin top aside. Place the buttered muffin bottom and cheese like you normally would and then place beaten egg mixture and anything else you want in the top and close the unit. Cook for 4 1/2 to 5 minutes. The egg will have a nice baked looking crust on top. Remove and place the muffin top back on, you can throw more cheese, or spread on at this point if you want it. Delicious, and something you won't get at any fast food joint.

  I'm not a cook, but I have to say, so far, it's been working great for me.  It really can't be much easier.  I haven't gone fancy yet.  I thought it was somewhat strange to throw on the egg, which I just use the shell to poke the yoke with and it works just fine.  But throwing on the top of the muffin onto the egg that hasn't cooked seemed strange?!?!  But you know what, it cooks the egg great.  It's king of cooked into the muffin, which holds them together better.  I've used Canadian Bacon which works great because it's about the right size.  I've also used sausage patty's, both already cooked of course, but the patty's are tiny!  Maybe next time I'll have to use a few of them and cut them to fill the whole bottom of the muffin.It heats up fast, so it's not exactly 5 minutes.  That doesn't count the warm up time.  It takes 4-5 minutes to do it's thing once it is warmed up.  The first time, the egg was just a bit runny, not fully cooked and you know what? It was still great.  No need to go to McDonald's to get your fix.The one Negative is there's no On/Off switch.  So it's plug in, pull the cord when done.  Why that is?  when I have more time, I can start trying other things with it.

  This breakfast sandwich maker has been well-loved since taking it out of the package. My fiancé gave it to me as a gift after hearing raves about it from a coworker, and now we see why - if you have prepared meat (like a frozen sausage patty or bacon cooked earlier in the week), then this makes a 10-minute gourmet breakfast from start to finish. All you have to do is cut the bread, add meat & cheese, crack an egg and wait! The quality for us that really brings this product up from a ""four-star breakfast maker"" the likes of waffle irons and griddles to a ""five-star essential first meal tool"" is the quick cleanup. The removable section is dishwasher safe and the non-stick outer cooking areas need only a quick wipe.

  This was a gift for my boyfriend for Christmas, (and me 😂) and it was a good idea! Makes sandwiches so quick, which is especially helpful when getting ready for work in the morning. The only reason I put 4 stars for “easy to use” is because I at first didn’t realize it came apart so easily, I thought the parts were clipped in and not just sitting. So at one point when I lifted it, it started to come apart! Thankfully I was wearing an oven mitt. But that was more operator error. So remember to open it pretty slow when taking the sandwich out! Other than that I love that it’s so easily taken apart to wash though, makes for a quick clean up once it’s cooled down and it’s small enough to just be placed in the cabinet until next use!

    Manufacturing issue?

  The egg plate you slide gets stuck on the handles in the front. (The plate handle gets stuck on the front handles) I have to open the top half so the plate will slide and complete the sandwich. I had one of these in the past and never needed to do this.It does make a sandwich though.

  I bought this for my husband last Christmas because he likes to have good breakfast before he goes to work. It’s really easy to use and you can even do something else while your food is “cooking.” It does’t take up so much space and can easily be stored away. Clean up is a breeze as well. Definitely recommended!

  This thing is fantastic it works great. But I will admit it works better with English muffins over anything else. Super easy to clean I keep it next to my toaster😃

  Washed it up out of the box.  Applied cooking spray on cold maker since that directive was not clear.  After reading other reviews I let it set 2 min. after green light went on.  Used classic English muffin, Canadian bacon, egg, and American Cheese.  Allowed to cook for 5 min.  The product turned out perfect, better then my local fast food joint, freshness was probably the most likely reason.  The only thing I'll change is to add pepper to my egg.  The only problem may be limiting myself to only one sandwich.

  There is nothing I can say about this item that others have not already written.  This product is awesome!  I originally bought this because I was tired of eating steel cut oats with a scoop of protein powder in the morning.  It does so much for your morale to eat something that taste good.  It will keep you moving and working harder if you feel good.  Finally I warm up the machine, put everything in the machine and it's finished by the time I finished brushing my teeth.Also since I changed my workout up a little I’ve also cut my calories too by using this.  I also I don't buy as much Syntha 6 now, so that saves me a little bit of money.

    Good but takes too long

  The egg sandwich maker does it’s job but it takes too long. You have to pre heat it first (about 10minutes) then make it which takes another 10-15minutes... not good when you’re in a hurry. It’ll take less time to actually just cook on the stove. It’s good for kids to use and making an egg sandwich at work. It does it’s job but just takes a bit too long.

  This lil sandwich maker brought me life.It's easy and it's really ready in 4 minutes!!!!I bought this lil sandwich maker whenever I realized we would be spending more time at home. Instead of using a toaster for your bread, a pan for your egg and ham you have a lil thing that does it all for you. Energy efficient. Fast and easy. 3 mouths fed in less than 30 minutes for breakfast. So easy my 10 year old knows how to use it.  Big pointer follow the directions on the book. And use a timer.

  English muffins yes. Bagels to big but can trim them. When using bagels bottom half fits ok, but found not to use top half until after egg cooks first. Otherwise egg slides out until cooked. Thickness of sandwich does matter when cooking. So overstuffing not recommended (why bagels don't work well). Otherwise works really well with sausage patties, porkroll and small strips of bacon. Scramble egg (no milk) works also.

  I bought some english muffins, they fit perfectly into the space available. Canadian Bacon slices work great. I also used some Jimmy Dean sausage patties. They're a little tall for this cooker, but if you smash them down a little bit first they fit pretty well. Clean up is super easy. It takes about 10 minutes total if you do your prep while it pre-heats. I've only used it a few times. We'll see how things hold up in the long term.

  Loved it at first and it makes great sandwiches but after a while the food started to taste like the metal in the maker or something, can’t stand the taste, I don’t use it anymore.
