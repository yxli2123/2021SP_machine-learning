  This product is not safe! Do not buy it! When I reclined in the chair the top went all the way to the ground and the foot went up in the air. When I was able to get free of the chair, my investigation revealed that it had not simply tipped over but the joint slipped (not securely fastened)  and now the chair will not return to the position of a chair as pictured. I bought this one because of the rating for 300# in the event that my 270# dad might use it but it couldn't even handle me.

",5.0,Dick Bowen,"Reviewed in the United States September 8, 2018","









  
  
    
  I'm roughly 244 lbs and I've been non-stop torturing this chair with a lot more than just my body weight. Most of these fold-up styled lawn chairs would've broken by now, and this one just has some minor scratches on the parts that touch the ground.  So can give this a very strong recommendation.One thing to keep in mind, tough I'm very rough on it, is that it has some elastic which means it shouldn't be left in direct sunlight. If you don't understand why this is a problem, I'd recommend first looking up elastic care. It's cheap and easy to replace the elastic, but also unnecessary if one cares for it correctly.

",2.0,Fragile Mystic,"Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  My chair is, in one word, dreadful. I am returning it. Given the reviews, it seems that every chair is different. There must be an issue with quality assurance and control. I hope Amazon Basics will update with a version II.I am a mellow person. I rarely get angry. This product annoyed me so much I was tempted to throw it out the window. I would not even donate this. I have purchased $15 beach chairs that are more comfortable.About me: I am 5’6”, 160 pounds (overweight), in my early 40’s. I maintain good posture, practice yoga, but have had some minor neck problems due to hyper mobility. I love hammocks. My living space - 200 sq ft.  I bought this for 4 reasons: 1) using it in zero gravity mode for relaxing and meditating; 2) Napping;  3) Watching TV and reading at a slight incline; and 4) lounging outside when it is warmer. Easy to fold when not in use, etc. I really really wanted the Timber Line XL padded zero gravity chair, but I am on a budget.Review of The chair: It arrived undamaged. Note: If you want it in an Amazon box to surprise someone, select that option at checkout. Opened the box, the chair comes assembled, it folds nicely, and it was easy to carry upstairs. There are no directions, no paperwork. It isn’t difficult to figure out. It opened smoothly. On each side there is a little dial to unscrew to recline to desired level, then screw the other way to lock in position. All good so far!Then I sat in it. My head rests against the very uncomfortable metal bar. There is a small headrest/lumbar pillow. In the lumbar area the mesh hangs down and does not “hug” your back like a hammock. I tried moving up and down, there was no comfortable position. I wanted to ease back into the NASA zero gravity position. No luck. I got back far enough, about 140 degrees. No change in the lumbar area, I put a Mackenzie roll behind me to fill the gap to no avail. My head, using the “headrest”, sank into the upper metal bar. I immediately got a headache, so I got out. Even my lower back was bothering me. In 10 minutes I went from feeling fine to a terrible headache.In my opinion, my chair must be defective. Given so many other reviews where people are tumbling backwards, not reclining, having the chair collapse, etc. I am happy for the people who got a quality controlled recliner.For the rest of us, this is a very evil chair that causes pain. I recommend staying away from it.

  It lasted about a month before the metal collapsed in the back where the back rest support is. I am 6’4” and 205 lbs so maybe it isn’t meant for a bigger guy but if that is the case they should have set a weight limit. I was able to fix it by welding a small metal bar in the spot it broke, but most people won’t be able to do that.

I can't sit in a regular chair for more than a a half hour and there's not much past TV or reading you can do flat on your back. With this chair I can sit up, yet sit far enough back to not aggregate the back for an hour, maybe more. I have one in the backyard - the first time I could enjoy the flowers and birds and sun in a long time. I have one inside by a lamp where I have started learning to draw.

  This chair has a knob to turn to keep it in place when you are reclined at the position you want.  However it is very hard to turn to get it locked down enough to keep the chair in position.  So you end up sitting straight up, or try to recline and the chair will keep decking until you are flat on your back.  If your looking for a chair like this, be sure it has a lever and NOT a knob

  I bought this for my husband as an early Father’s Day present and the chair looks great and he says it’s very comfortable. He does say the locking feature doesn’t hold very well in a half recline position though. The reason for a four star versus a five star is because there are some contradictory information regarding the chair’s weight limit. The product description online says it will hold up to 300 lbs, but the paper that comes with the chair says 200 lbs. My husband is a little over 200 so it’s probably not that big of a deal, but it’s still confusing nonetheless.

  This product was exactly what I wanted. I have extremely bad nerve pain at my tailbone and can not sit up or reclined for more than a few minutes. I usually stand while at work or lay down at home. I wanted to relax in my back yard and needed something that took the pressure off of my tail bone. A normal beach chair won't work for me. This char is perfect! It is easy to maneuver into the fully reclined position and took the pressure off of my lower back. The only modification I had to do was add some padding to where my ankles / lower calves rest on the foot rest area. I'm 6'4"" and 180lbs so my legs hang over more than probably what the chair was designed for. Other than this everything else is great!!

  Awesome chair. I read all the reviews and felt confident that this would be a good value for the price. It impressed me. Very comfortable, folds small, easy to operate, all around awesome chair.  My only tiny concern is how you the twist-locks that keep the chair locked in a certain position (eg, upright, horizontal) quickly get loose and you can (inadvertently or intentionally) swing yourself into a different position. But it’s a tiny concern — it moves slowly, so the frustration is more with re-tightening all the time rather than any real fear of flipping horizontal. The positives of this chair, and the incredible price, make thins well worth it. I bought a second one.

",4.0,fatbag,"Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2018","









  
  
    
  It works, holds my 250lb body, stores flat, and is comfortable. The locks are not that effective so I can’t move around much when reclined, I suppose I would have pain a little more to get the thing to lock in place. Maybe tall heavy people aren’t meant to sit in foldin chairs.

  This is an amazingly comfortable chair. It allowed me to attend events that were previously not possible due to pain when sitting for more than a few moments. I could be up for hours at a time with no increase in pain. I purchased this for poolside parties at my daughters house. My son in law, who is more than a foot taller than me and twice my weight also loved it. It is a smash hit.

    Getting into the chair isn't so easy...
  
",3.0,LJWalter,"Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  Once you're in the chair feels great no matter what position you have it in. However, getting into the chair can be a bit of a challenge, especially for those of us who are older. The foot rest (as you can see from the picture) extends past the ""feet"" of the chair and does not sit flush with the ground. Standing in front of the chair and sitting down in a normal fashion is actually quite a drop. Straddling the foot rest is uncomfortable, but provides a shorter drop into the chair. I don't want to give mine up, but I wouldn't recommend it to anyone else who is past the nimble stage of their life.

    Comfortable, Portable, Low Price Chair

  This chair is amazing! It’s the most comfortable reclining, lawn chairs I’ve ever sat/laid on! It’s portable, and easy to fold/unfold. The lock feature gives you the confidence and security that you want and need in a reclining chair. The headrest gives you the added cushion and comfort that you want in a reclining chair. The price is right for this chair. Overall I highly suggest purchasing this chair.
