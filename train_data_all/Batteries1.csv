  The quality of this batteries is pretty good specially for the price, they have a nice weight to them and have not leaked on any of my devices. Their only weakness is that they don't seem to hold for a while as I noticed that the longer I have them the more they are loosing their strength. If you use them right away you will have the best results.

  I recently purchased 3 sets of the 12 D cell battery packs for my outdoor motion detector lights.  Upon receiving the batteries, which were packaged very well, I tested each battery with a volt meter before installing them in the lights.  All batteries had a charge of between 1.61 and 1.62 volts.  These batteries are rated at 1.5 volts, so all were above the listed voltage.  How they hold up is another question that I will answer after some time has passed.

  These batteries seemed like a great buy until I needed them during Hurricane Irma and they couldn't power the battery-operated fan I wanted to lend to my neighbor whose power was out.I bought these batteries in May 2017, and while they worked in a flashlight they did not work in the battery-operated fan. At first I assumed that the problem was with the fan. Then this week I bought other batteries and tried the fan and it worked. I double checked and the Amazon batteries still did not work in the fan.So, if I could return these I would. Don't count on them powering much other than a basic flashlight.

    Arrive with good charge and sized right, maybe old stock
  
",4.0,Bryan,"Reviewed in the United States November 20, 2018","









  
  
    
  I put these on the voltmeter and got 1.62 V reading on each of 3 I tested.  I compared them to two other new/unused D cells, the Duracell Coppertop (assembled in US) and the Rayovac Fusion, both of which tested at 1.61V.  The Amazon cell and the other two were all nearly exactly (within 2/10 of a mm) the same length and diameter.  The expiration dates on the Amazon cells were Oct 2022; the expiration dates on the Duracell and Rayovac cells were Mar 2027 and Nov 2025, respectively, and I've had those cells for about a year.  Maybe Amazon puts more realistic expiration dates on their cells, or maybe they ship older stock, who knows.  The packaging of the Amazon cells was very solid...two rows of 6 cells, each row shrink-wrapped, and a cardboard divider between the pos & neg terminals as the two rows lay lengthwise in the box.  The packaging makes them great to use for long-term emergency storage, especially if the expiration dates are usually further out like the competition...unless those dates are all BS anyway.  The voltmeter doesn't lie.  I would not trust these to leave in a device long term...I assume they would leak like every other Chinese alkaline battery I have ever used.  I wish Energizer Ultimate Lithium made D cells...their AA and AAA non-rechargables are bulletproof and the gold standard in non-rechargeable cells.

After 2weeks they're dead and its frustrating to constantly replace them. The other amazon white batteries were the best but thsese are garbage.

    BATTERIES LEAK ACID!!!!!!!!!
  
",1.0,Andrea D.,"Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2017","









  
  
    
  THESE BATTERIES LEAK ACID and DESTROYED OUR HARDWOOD FLOORS!  These batteries were placed in a keyboard.  Even though the keyboard was still working I noticed large dark brown splatters all over our hardwood floors and acid leaking out of the battery compartment.  We have never had this problem in the keyboard with any other batteries.  The cost of refinishing the floors make these cheap batteries INCREDIBLY expensive.  Remove these batteries from anything you've put them in immediately!

I replace all of them about once a year, and the one on my driveway that’s on a lot (every time a car drives by) about 3 times a year.  They are the high output lights and these power them for a long time.

  I bought these batteries for the outside net lights I put on the bushes for Christmas.  I saw they were cheaper than Duracell or Energizer and had good ratings, so I gave them a try.  I installed them in the lights and put the lights out on my bushes a week after Thanksgiving.  Winters in the upper midwest get cold, but these batteries kept the lights going brightly every night for 6 hours, for a month and still have juice in them.  I removed them from the lights and packed them away until next Christmas.  I did not check them with a meter, so I don't know how much juice is in them, but I'm impressed they were able to power on in the extra cold weather we had this year.

  Both of my boat live wells hold 5 D cells, both wells are identical. I put copper tops in one and these Amazon batteries in the other, the wells always turned on and off at the same time. Normally my copper tops last 3-4 trips. This Amazon batteries lasted about 10 minutes longer than the cooper tops. I then rotated the batteries in the wells  and the same with Amazon batteries last about 10 minutes longer in the other live well.

  Really hoping that these were going to be close to as good as name brands.  Was on a hunting trip and running sets of 3 D cells in Streamlight lanterns.  All three lanterns were running low and swapped out batteries for all three at the same time.  One lantern got a set of Energizers that had been laying around for about 5 years, one got a set of Duracells that had been around for about the same length of time, and the third lantern got a set of the Amazon basics that were less than a year old.Within two days the lantern with the Amazon basics was already showing the first level of depletion (green light -> orange light -> red light -> blinking red light).  Within another evening of use it was to the red light.  Both of the other sets were still on green the whole time.

    Very Good Value Priced D-Cell Alkaline
  
",5.0,Mr. Staack,"Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2016","









  
  
    
  Good quality batteries.  The power output and longevity of these batteries in my equipment seem comparable to the Rayovac and Duracell alkaline cells I use, and I haven't had a single rupture or leak.  Out all the cells I've used so far, every one performed well, without a single dud.  For the money, I think these are the best D-Cells out there - and I've tried a LOT.  Here's my results of real-world usage (most favorite, to least favorite):AmazonBasics - Good power output, average longevity, consistently low price.Rayovac - Good power output, great longevity, varied price (I find good deals every few weeks).  Never seem to leak.Ikea - Average power output (flickers a little), fair longevity, usually the lowest price.Maxell - Good power output, great longevity, good price, but one in every few dozen eventually leaks.Duracell - Good power output, great longevity, varied price, but one in every few dozen eventually leaks.Sunbeam - Average power output, fair longevity, consistently low price, but prone to leakage.Energizer - Inconsistent power output (some flicker a lot, some don't), average longevity, can be expensive, and seem VERY prone to leakage.As such, I now use the AmazonBasics in all of my everyday-use D-cell flashlights, lanterns, and motion sensors.  I save the Rayovacs for stuff I keep in storage, and in my emergency kits.  I'm currently storing a few AmazonBasics to test them for leakage, and - thus far - I haven't had a single one leak.  I'll update my review, as I use them further.

",3.0,AB,"Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2019","









  
  
    
  I have bought many types of AmazonBasics batteries because they are significantly cheaper than others.  In  most of my experiences the batteries have held up well and I'm satisfied with them.What I'm not sure of is whether or not these batteries are cheaper because they have less capacity (measured in mAh) which is kind of important to know.  You can't compare apples to apples unless you know how much you're going to get out of a battery.  So these batteries may look like a better deal than the name brand batteries because they are so cheap, but if they have 10x less mAh, then you're not getting a deal.  Do these batteries have 10x less capacity than Energizer or other brands??  I don't know ... because Amazon doesn't put that information in the description.  I mean, mAh capacity and the price are really the only two primary metrics people need to know to compare most batteries.  It's like buying a light bulb and not knowing if it's supposed to last 10 hours or 50,000 hours.  For such basic information as that I know it's not an oversight; Amazon has decided not to be forthcoming about it so it's certainly perceived as something they want to hide.With that concern in mind, my personal uses for batteries don't require a lot of power.  For TV remotes, air pumps, etc the AmazonBasics batteries seem to last long enough to be worth it.  I did notice that these batteries didn't seem to last long in a simple strand of LED lights we used for Christmas decorations.  I think it lasted for about 3 weeks even though we only turned the lights on during nighttime hours.  I would assume those little LED lights use almost no energy but that's the only example I have where the battery life seemed shorter than expected.Conclusion: For heavier activity I would probably buy batteries that I knew had longer life.  For simple around-the-house usage these work just fine.

  I always thought amazon carry quality product. But this is not the case with those D batteries. Only last about half of the Alkaline.Personally I think Alkaline is the best battery. I've also tried Energizer, but Alkaline just last longer....Amazon basics is about~65% comparing to Energizer~50% comparing to AlkalineI am not trying to recommend any brand, just a fishermen who uses those battery constantly on a air pump. So, usage is also constantly, I know how many fishing trips they last.

  These batteries are an excellent value for my money...I expect them to last a long time...I have no idea what motion detection means so gave that an OK..I read a long time ago, that the brand of the battery didn't matter much when purchasing them.  I have been purchasing this brand in different sizes for the last year or so, and I believe that is true.Will update my review in case anything changes.  These were ordered through Prime and delivered to my door.  The trip to the nearest store is 40 minutes one way.  I needed these quickly as I have a propane refrigerator and the light inside runs on batteries...Most highly recommended.

  Bought five different types of batteries and the D, C, and 9volt did not have the full five year shelf life remaining.  That's the problem.  Paid for five years and didn't get it.  Also the comparison of batteries compared your batteries with all the ten year shelf life batteries... NOT a true comparison at all... In fact misleading... Like comparing a five year old car to a ten year old car... Bad product comparison and not what was paid for.  Wasn't worth it to have to pay shipping to return batteries in order to get an exchange.

  I purchased these batteries to power my baby’s toy. These batteries seem to work great. Based on the reviews, I was a bit worried about purchasing a bunch of batteries that could be duds. Then I looked at the reviews more in detail and realized that most of the bad reviews were from a few years ago. Amazon must have fixed their issues since then.Some things I noted are that:1. These are not rechargeable. If you want rechargeable batteries, you should purchase the amazon basics rechargeable batteries.2. There’s not much of a price difference between these Amazon basics batteries (12 pack) and the Energizer Max D (12 pack). At the time of this writing, there’s only a 50 cent difference (Amazon Basics - $14.49, Energizer Max ($15). If you want a brand name, you may as well go for Energizer Max.3. A Duracell 8 pack ($13.98) is only approximately 50 cents less than the Amazon Basics 12 pack ($14.49).Overall, these batteries work fine. If you don’t need a brand name batteries, you should just purchase these.

  My first impression is that they are good batteries.  I purchased several sizes (AA, AAA, D etc) and have used them in kids toys and flashlights. Battery life seems good, nothing has failed so far.  Based upon other reviews I checked them over and all seem to be manufactured correctly - these look different from older reviews so I'm thinking they are ""new and improved.""The area for improvement is the packaging. I know, minor detail.  While I like the cardboard sleeve that they come in, the batteries themselves are shrink wrapped in plastic into groups of ~4 (depends on size).  The sleeve is fragile and now I just have a pile of loose batteries (a mix of shrink wrapped and loose ones).  It would be nice if the cardboard sleeve served as something to store / organize / dispense them, like Pez candy.  The bottom edge of the box needs to open - not the side.  Duck tape to the rescue.So far, yes I'd buy them again. Although I still use name-branded 9V in the fire-alarms.

  Have no idea how I lived before discovering your auto-delivery on batteries. I live back in a small farming community and off the grid and depend on my motion lights for safety and security being home alone so often. All use D batteries and my inside power outage lights also use aaa-d batteries and Amazon Brand saves the day, or night as it were, due to so many power outages and my pets to also be able to see while outside. This is a wonderful service, often gift batteries to other friends to spread the word of price and quality. Huge thanks for my safety net for lighting and more. Great shipping and customer service. A+++++

    They DO NOT compare to Duracell.
  
",1.0,David,"Reviewed in the United States November 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  I used these in my baby swing. It was very easy to tell the quality in something we use so much.I first used Duracell, and the batteries lasted about a month, maybe a little over...I tried these, and I was lucky to get a weeks use out of them. Usually about 4 days. Very disappointing. After the pack was gone, I told my husband to pick up more Duracell batteries on his way home from work--- 3 weeks ago--- and they are still going strong.If you're using a lot of juice, don't bother with the Amazon ones.

  I purchased these as a less expensive option for a small light and fan that we took camping.  The batteries lasted the whole camping trip, and we had the fan on all night in the tent, and the light for a couple hours every night.  These worked just as well as the more expensive batteries.

  Seem to work like most batteries did not really test side by side to others so cant really say what life is like on them.

  I buy these for home or work and you can’t beat the price they work as well as any other brand battery.I haven’t noticed that a lose power or “die” faster than more expensive batteries. Give them a try!

  Batteries were used for Christmas small strand lights and different candles.  Never lasted more than a week and were only turned on at night for maybe 4 hours.  Just not worth the aggravation to replace 3 or 4 times during Christmasseason.  Will not purchase again.
