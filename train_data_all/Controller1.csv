    Child-like Wonder
  
",5.0,K. Ken,"Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I haven't enjoyed turning on a new next-gen controller like this since probably when the Xbox 360 came out (I loved that controller). This is probably the best controller I've ever held and played. The haptic feedback is amazing and playing Astro's Playroom with it is a giddy child-like wonder. Seriously. Awesome choice by Sony to have a free game out like Astro's with their new console launch. And it's an extremely fun game, too. But back to the controller- best controller I've had and this goes back to my NES days. Pair this with a PS DualSense Charging Station as well- well worth it as it's a nice upgrade from the PS4/DualShock4 station. The controller just magnetically/magically snaps into place to charge instead of the awkward angle-finding you had to do with the PS4 charging station.

  Great controller! Feels great in the hands and the buttons are very clicky. Haptic feedback and new adaptive triggers are amazing. Just a great piece of next gen tech overall.

  Excited to try these out and they have the best of the previous gen but with more tech. Love the look too. Playing Miles Morales or any game that makes use of the situational rumble completely changes the experience. Also the tension based triggers are a new dynamic too!

    Great premium feel. Minor PC compatibility
  
",4.0,Anthony,"Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2021","









  
  
    
  This controller feel like premium quality for a default controller. The only bad thing is it has very minor compatibility to PC. There is no adaptive trigger support and the rumble is kinda buggy. It also won't work with certain games unless it's plugged in via usb port. That's not a problem Sony can fix and it's very small. Hopefully PC will get full support in the next year or so.

  Ive been gaming since 1988. Combines the best of a PS4 & Xbox One controller, good hand feels. Why do people need to post their failures on here about their inability to preorder a product? Grow up.Update, if you‚Äôre playing Cold War there‚Äôs a really cool trigger effect ( you can shut this off) the right trigger collapses like a real trigger. I‚Äôm also finding battery life isn‚Äôt as bad as they‚Äôre saying, but I bough my an extra anyway.

    Not good for PC gaming. Randomly turns off and no way to determine state of charge
  
",1.0,Joe Wight,"Reviewed in the United States February 24, 2021","









  
  
    
  I purchased this controller for PC gaming. to replace a logitech controlller that cuts out. This controller worked great for a month and then it started randomly turning off. I guess it won't hold a charge cause I can take it off the charger, put it to use and it might last 5-30 minutes and then turns off. turn it back on and it turns off again in 30 seconds. repeat until you give up.... Hopefully Sony does right by this faulty product.Additionally there is no indication of the actual state of charge. Seems like on a controller with RGB LEDs built in you would make them capable of use for showing when the controller needs to be charged. Nope, They're just to make it look cool. stupid.

    Third Time's A Charm
  
",4.0,CAS,"Reviewed in the United States March 10, 2021","









  
  
    
  I just wanna say I dont normally write reviews, but I take my controllers seriously as of getting this one.A little backstory: First, I bought the PowerA Spectra, about $40, for wired PC gaming. It was faulty right out of the box, usable, but faulty. Returned quickly. I then got the XBOX Core Controller, $60. I had higher hopes for this one, but even after buying it new, it was  clearly repackaged when I got it. I thought ""that's fine, as long as it works"". Well, guess what it didn't do? Work! The right back trigger was faulty and sticky, again, right out the box. Sent that back the day of getting it.The Dualsense was my ""third time's a charm"" option. It was past my budget but I decided you really get what you pay for in the controller market, so I sprung for it.Pros:- Comfortable- Weighted, feels like good quality- I find the precision of the sticks to be much more responsive and fine-tuned than the Core controller.- The touchpad. I didn't know I needed this until I had it, but the versatility with what the touchpad alone can do, blew my mind.- LED. Nuff said- Soft not-loud clicky buttons- Grip design is an added bonus- Gyro is included, which XBOX Controller doesn't haveCons:- Kinda hard to configure if youre not used to remapping controllers- Compatibility is not as good as XBOX controllers- Third party remapping program is likely required- Gyro configuration even more convoluted, still haven't successfully figured out the settings to get them where I want and I've spent a good few days coming back to it trying to figure it out.Overall, the Dualsense is a home run out of these three. You get what you pay for, but I was still surprised. If you're able to spend the extra money, go for the Dualsense.

    Feels comfortable and works on PS3?
  
",4.0,JustAnotherUser,"Reviewed in the United States November 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  Controller came in today. It does not come with any USB-C cable, which is a bummer, but not unexpected. I could not get it to work on my PS4 via wired connection, but it does work for some reason on the PS3. Was able to play some PS3 games with the controller (not all games work), only thing that fails to function on the PS3 is the home button and the vibration. Feels comfortable to play on and fits right in the palms of my hands. Looking forward to using it on an actual PS5 :)

  I just received my new Dualsense controller for a system that's not even out yet and was immediately heartbroken once I realized someone already opened it and took it out of the box before I did. It's safe to assume an Amazon employee had a little bit extra time on their hands and took it out to look at it.

  Buying brand name (Sony, in this case) buys you quality like this. Zero issues with the wireless sync and a really long charge. Don't buy a knock-off, as you'll only end up disappointed in the quality and end up having to buy two controllers in the long run.

  I purchased two of these refurbished controllers, received them yesterday, and started using them.  The first one looked essentially new and connected without issue.  The second one took 3 tries to connect for some reason, but eventually connected and has been working fine through a few hours of gameplay.  The second controller also had significant palm sweat residue on the lower side of the controller that had to be cleaned off.  It seems like it would be an easy fix to ""refurbish"" them with a simple cleaning cloth like I did, so I can only assume that no actual refurbishment or renewal effort actually occurred.

    Waiting for awhile to get a PS5? DualSense makes a great PS3 controller... Seriously.
  
",4.0,JRSIV Music Ltd.,"Reviewed in the United States November 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  I usually wait well into a generation to get a new console. First reason is obvious: launch units are notoriously buggy and prone to failure and usually within a year or two the console has had several sku's & model numbers with modifications that aren't visual but internal. Sony has made it a tradition to introduce a ""Slim"" model 2-3 years into the generation. But now with the PS4 Pro it's reasonable to assume a ""point 5 (.5) Pro"" upgrade version will also join the tradition.Second reason I usually wait is games. Launch games are hit and miss & in low numbers. Because most have a previous generation version as well (Miles Morales for PS4, etc) it can be argued that true next gen games take a year or two to arrive. Indeed one of the big selling points of the PS5 is that it will play PS4 games with superior performance, hopefully doing away with the endless ""remastered"" versions of previous gen games.When I first got a PS3 in 2012 there was a ton used games for pennies on the dollar of the price they debuted with. I still have plenty of highly rated PS3 games in my backlog that were bought for $5. I didn't get a PS4 until last year (a Pro actually), and since the PSN deals were so insane I started buying digital games only. Come on, $10 for all three BioShock games remastered? Like the PS3 I have tons of PS4 games I haven't played.Which brings us to this controller and why would I buy it. Last gen I bought a DualShock 4 right after they came out (before the PS4, just like the DualSense came out before the PS5), after hearing it worked on PS3. It doesn't work on everything and the PS button doesn't work period. But it's damn sure more comfortable than a DS3.Which is why I bought the DualSense. Word came that it too played on PS3 and I just thought oh well and ordered one. Now it is a nice controller, very comfortable and well made, but for me the DS4 is still the best controller I've ever used. The round handles are a bit more balanced than these XBox style wings on the DSense. It's still worth owning as it's very comfortable and if you can't get a PS5 or are waiting like me, you will be assimilated to the controller by the time you get a PS5...um, or PS5 Pro. If it was black we'd be in 5 star territory, but that grey off white is just too blah...Still, a great controller from Sony.

  The square button is unresponsive half the time, can only be attributed to a bad solder job. The face buttons are nice plastic, but I expected them to feel as glassy as they look.

The haptics understandably don't work even with Steam's BP, which is also understandable in a way.The fact that we're having problems like drift and unresponsiveness in a $70 product is still unacceptable and I'm returning it.

    Works on PC with Steam without DS4 and on Android
  
",4.0,SerenityFade,"Reviewed in the United States March 8, 2021","









  
  
    
  So this isn't a complete and comprehensive review as I am not using this with a PS5 but rather a PC and android tablet.  I can report that it works for both, but there are some caveats to be addressed.  First, regarding the build the control is just superb feeling in the hand and kind of swanky.  It just feels good in your hands.  The buttons are not clicky but rather buttery smooth yet still responsive.  The whole form factor brings about that classic and nostalgic familiarity that we've come to expect with PS controllers, but it still manages to create it's own futuristic image, and again, feel.  On PC, yes it's true Steam is your best friend.  Don't expect much support outside of Steam unless you are using DS4 which is buggy at best.  Functional! But buggy.  Yes you can pair the controller with your PC if you have bluetooth on your system but Windows itself likes it best if you use a USB-C cable and wire this puppy in.  Steam could care less what you use, bluetooth or cable, it will pick it up.  Within Steam you can customize the button layout as you see fit and the controller can be used as it were a distinct Playstation controller and not a generic controller dressed up like an Xbox 360 controller.  With that being said there is an issue with the duelsense functions and the track pad and neither feature seems to function well.  Not, necessarily a deal breaker for me, but still kind of a bummer nonetheless.  With regards to android, the controller can be paired with your phone or tablet and it work within games that actually have controller support.  The problem is there aren't that many games that have full controller support to begin with.  So there is that.  Also on Android don't expect to be able to customize the controls at all.  There are much cheaper options for this use case that will get the job done, but if you happen to have one of these on hand and you want to do some Android gaming, this will work with titles that have the support.  My one gripe is that the controller doesn't come with a Type C cable.  Nothing.  A box, instructions of sorts, and the controller.  I guess Sony thought cables are cheap enough and you can just go get your own.

  The immediate difference most will feel is the weight.  The DualSense has good weight distribution and feels full in your hand (which is also on account of it being slightly larger and wider).  The DS4 seems hollow after picking up a DualSense.The triggers are more sturdy and do not have the loose feeling the triggers on DS4 have.The texture of the controller is nice in your hands.The create and option buttons have better placement and are easier to access compared to DS4.The directional and face buttons have good surface feel, the touchpad is roughly the same, and the subdued lightbar is great.My only small gripe would be the thumbsticks.  They are about the same size as the DS4‚Äôs and I wish they were just a bit bigger.Simply put, this controller is considerably better than the DS4 and this is without feeling the haptic feedback or adaptive triggers in games.We‚Äôre in for a great gen with this controller!

  I've used the PS5 controller now for about 4 months and can say it's one of my favorites yet. The bulky build with the go to Sony design is amazing. The adaptive triggers are awesome and the new vibration setup is much more realistic and comfortable. The controller is very durable and the PC support out of the box is phenomenal. Definitely worth the amount charged.

  I usually don't write reviews, but this controller is a whole different beast. There's nothing else like it on the market. It is well built with the perfect size for most hands. There's also a little easter egg on the back of the controller, being that the grip for you to hold the controller is made out of little (and I mean like microscopic) X, O, Triangles and Squares. I think it's a very nice little touch and it just shows how much effort sony put in to make this the best controller they possibly could. Now, the one con of the controller is that you have to jump through tons of hoops to get it working on PC, but this is an issue only because the PS5 hasn't come out yet at the time I'm writing this review, and they haven't made the drivers public yet. There is a way, but you have to go on youtube to figure it out (took me about 30 minutes to get it working but after that it was flawless). Overall, this is the best controller you can get at the moment, and I highly recommend getting it now if you have a PC or a PS4 (and also for some reason it works on PS3, sort of). If you're just waiting on the PS5 and you want one of these early, I would highly recommend getting it now before it goes out of stock because it truly is the BEST CONTROLLER.

  The PS5 is amazingly fast! The startup, the loading of games and levels are a breath of fresh air for console gaming.The Dualsense controller, though, is really what puts this console over the top in terms of immersion and that feeling of something new for this generation. It FEELS like next gen with games like Astro's Playroom. The feeling it provides really adds something that is amazing and fresh and once it's implimented properly in games, like Astro's, you won't want to play without it.The size and weight feels just about right for me. My hands are on the larger side. Also, the battery life has been fine for my liking. My longest session without break was around 4-5 hours and I had 2 bars left at the end of it. Not the most scientific test but I rarely go for longer than that, so I'm ok with it.The buttons, triggers and sticks feel good with decent feedback when squeezed/clicked. The adaptive triggers are part of the fresh experience along with the haptic feedback and together they really make this controller shine.Overall, I think that there will be gaming experiences that are unique to this generation and because of the Dualsense controller, the PS5 will be the console to have.

  I have lots of controllers. This one is the best. Its great. Sticks are very accurate. Feels good and best of all it actually fits my large hands. Works great on PC, you need Steam. If playing a nonSteam game, you need to ""add nonsteam game to Steam"" and play that way to use the controller drivers.only cons: You can feel the x/o/tri/sqr buttons rub against the plastic frame. This wasnt a problem on PSx or Ps2 controllers. It seems like it has gotten worse with Ps3 then Ps4 and now Ps5 controller.I only use it thru Steam, but trackpad could be better. I dont know if that Steam's drivers or hardware, probably hardware

    PlayStation 5 controller is art!
  
",4.0,Mr.Epic,"Reviewed in the United States November 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  The PS5 controller is awesome, although I don‚Äôt have a ps5 and don‚Äôt plan on getting one. I am a pc gamer and only use PlayStation controllers because I am used to it from ps2-ps4 days. Let me start off with this. The controller is really nice in the hands. A bit bigger then first gen ps4 controller(the comparison controller in the photos). The controller is a bit heavier and the triggers I can‚Äôt test yet. The biggest pro I see is that the big light on top of the ps4 controller that is blue for player one even on the dim setting was crazy bright. Ps5 controller fixed that. The controller feels like a PlayStation controller but has the size of an xbone controller. The only thing that seems like a step down is the one butting no one uses. The touch pad button. It feels a bit mushy compared to the previous gen. Altogether I‚Äôd give it a 4/5 stars. Durability with the triggers is a concern but for now I‚Äôm satisfied. Will update to see if it can be used on pc without software later.Update 11/9/2020. Using steam, you can use the controller for now as a generic controller. Make sure that is selected. You will not have rumble until there is official support. The ps4 pairing method is identical as the ps5 which is good because I am used to it. Would also like to note I played through the entire bio shock infinite without needing a charge and zero connectivity issues. On the ps4 I sometimes have drop outs for a split second and don‚Äôt even get me started with the xbone one controller. Overall very solid and feels great in the hand. Good luck gamers

  The controller itself feels great. It's heavier and bigger that the ps4 controller which I like, and the triggers especially feel nice. They brought all the nice ergonomics from the ps4 controller to this controller, which I appreciate a lot. However, there's no good or reliable software to use this controller with on PC, not right now anyway. Using it on Steam Big Picture might be ok, but I personally don't like Steam Big Picture, it feels kinda goofy and I don't think it looks very good. My major problem, is that I couldn't connect wireless earbuds at the same time that this controller is connected. I like to use Samsung Galaxy buds and a mic stand when I game, and had no issues with this when using a ps4 controller. With the dualsense controller, both devices intermittently disconnect and reconnect. I'm not sure if this would be an issue with other wireless hearing devices; from what I know, other gaming headsets come with their own bluetooth adapter, so connecting both shouldn't be an issue in that case. But even with how nice this controller feels, it's not worth the hassle if you're gonna use it for PC, not until someone makes some good software for it. Also doesn't come with a charging wire but I think everyone knows that already. For PS5, get it I guess; for PC, just stick to the old ps4 controller and DS4 windows.

However not all games are yet supported so some buttons won't be mapped correctly. I also play emulators on my phone which allows me to map the buttons as I desire.The control feels a little heavier than the DualShock 4 but those micro engravings they added to the control feel so good.

  As a Playstation owner since PS1 through PS4, this is one of the few times I can say that I have been blown away by their evolution of the dualshock/dualsense controller.  The haptic feedback is like none other.  While some titles like Astrobot fully integrate and take advantage of this, other games will not, but that does not diminish what Sony has accomplished with this latest iteration.  You would be remiss to not snag a second controller with PS5.  The battery life is great compared to DS4, but haptic feedback will affect the amount of time the controller battery lasts.  A second controller is a must for games that heavily integrate the feedback for that reason.

  Dual sense is amazing when it comes to working with a ps5 with the haptic feed back and the adaptive triggers. A truly immersive experience. The shape of the controller is also an improvement compared to it's cousins of the past. However the analogs have taken a step back and so has the d pad. Both are aesthetically nice looking but the input on the d-pad is way too off the nose and they are prone to drift which is horrible. The dpad feels like responsive than the DS4 or even the DS3. If you are using this for a ps5 really great experience even with  those drawbacks but for PC very underwhelming/mediocre.

  This is a very nice controller, but I would not recommend buying it from Amazon, at least for now. The controller I received had already been opened. The sticker sealing the box had been peeled off and the top flap of the box was torn. There are other reviews on Amazon mentioning the same issue so it seems like someone is tampering with Amazon's stock.The controller itself is great, works well on PC using Steam Big Picture mode, both wired and wirelessly through Bluetooth. Only downside is that rumble does not work currently on PC. Hopefully Steam eventually adds rumble support for this controller.

    The best controller you can get right now
  
",5.0,Aiden Frances,"Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2021","









  
  
    
  So the haptics on the Switch Pro Controller were pretty amazing, but the DualSense takes it up a notch with its adaptive triggers (which feel amazing by the way). It's also surprisingly comfortable despite having 0 padding whatsoever, used this before for 8+ hours while playing Persona 5 and Apex and it feels great, no discomfort (minus my hands sweating and making the controller feel kinda sticky, granted that's easily fixed by me washing my hands), and it even works for PC! Steam has full support for the DualSense so you don't need to use DS4Windows anymore, just plug it in and Steam will detect it! Seriously my favorite controller out there right now, definitely a must have! (unless you're on Xbox)

  Sony really outdid themselves with this controller. They could have kept it the same as the Dualshock but they didn't and I'm glad. The dual sense is often criticized as gimmicky but I disagree because when you play the game the controller's adaptive triggers and haptic feedback arent in your face like people think. Also, you can turn off these features in the settings of your games if you don't want them. Compared to the Dualshock it feels much better quality, fits in the hand better, all the buttons feel way better to press, it's a little heavier than the Dualshock, and it has a little pattern on the back of the controller. Overall 10/10 controller and delivery for it.

  I feel like this is one of the best controllers Sony has made, only downside for me is that it gets dirty quickly, at least for me, but since I don‚Äôt see a lot of people complaining, it means it‚Äôs probably only me and a few others. Haptics feedback is great but can be hit or miss in some games, Astro‚Äôs Playroom truly utilize the feature to it‚Äôs full potential, but others feels like a better rumble, still, overall better. Adaptive triggers it‚Äôs a big upgrade for me, really love the effect of resistance that some games bring, this one is definitely the best feature of the controller. Built in mic is okay, I have my own headsets so I don‚Äôt use it very often, quite nice to have the button since you can mute all sounds in a pinch. I would love to see what new games can do by using those features.

",4.0,P. Sherman,"Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2021","









  
  
    
  After a bit of wrangling, it works fine with my Mac as a solid bluetooth controller. It works in Steam ok, but for games that don't directly support it, I used the app Enjoyable to map the buttons to keypresses and the analog sticks to mouse movements. I created a couple of profiles in Enjoyable - Basic controller, full setup, and then a couple for individual games that don't support keymapping. Once you have these profiles set up (simply tell the program what button does what), then its easy to turn on the profile and then it works just like a standard HID Bluetooth controller. I did have to re-pair when coming out of steam Big Picture, though. Seems the controller driver doesn't want to let go and you have to disconnect in the menubar app then turn the controller back on. Easy enough when you know the trick. Also supported natively in OpenEmu, so if you're big into retro gaming, this is a fantastically responsive controller for you!Note: This won't have the extra Dualsense features until Apple supports it natively, but that's coming with Big Sur 11.3. This is new hardware (as of early 2021), and it takes a bit to get solid support. The PS4 Dualshock is more solid right now, but I wanted to futureproof my purchase.

    Flaw With Triggers
  
",3.0,,"Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2021","









  
  
    
  This controller is good, and the size is perfect. The new technology in this controller are cool and fun, but in the end is a gimmick unless you truly care about a controller vibrating in your hands. Now for the giant flaw with the controller, the adaptive triggers. While cool to feel your gun kick our pressure from a gas pedal, this feature will ultimately ruin the controller. So, a small motor turns a plastic screw that turns a plastic gear to simulate different actions you may experience in the game. Great, but did they plan for the force of the human finger to push back against these components? or did they use durable enough parts? So far in my experience- no. As of right now on both of my PS5 controllers, the right trigger is very loose and sometimes triggers on it own. I believe this to be because of the function of the adaptive trigger forcing back against my trigger pulls. Maybe I have bad luck, but I'm two for two and am not looking forward to buying another.Also the games I play are Dirt 5, COD Cold War, Borderlands 3, and Warframe- all with this feature, so I suggest shutting it off.

So i bought a new one on Amazon and its even worse, all the buttons on the right side feel sticky and used even though its brand new. I've compared my ps5 controllers to my brother's ps5 controller and there is notable difference.  The buttons on my brother ps5 controller feels a bit more responsive and doesn't stick at all.

  The controller feels much nicer than the DualShock 4. It‚Äôs bigger, so it will also be a nice change for people with bigger hands.The textured back of the controller has nice implemented details for Sony fans. If you look close enough, it is composed of the face buttons. The shoulder buttons also protrude more than the DualShock 4. The triggers at stock have a very nice smooth pull with some resistance. It will be nice to see how some games utilize the adaptive triggers. The PS button is now the logo from PlayStation 1 instead of a circle which also works as a nice translation to P5 if you really want to get poetically crazy. The touchpad has a little more resistance because the way the surface is treated. Instead of a silky smooth matte surface like the DS4, this one seems like it‚Äôs just a matte surface without the silk. The face buttons all have a super nice soft, but tactile press.Design wise, the controller is creatively constructed. I think a lot of thought has been put into the design than people would like to think and it deserves critique. The white portions of the controller protrude about 1/32‚Äù higher than the black striping. At first, I thought I would be able to feel what seems like annoying transitions between the two colors, but surprisingly, the white acts as a literal translation of where your hands will be when you hold the controller. It‚Äôs very diagrammatic; kind of like architecture that is designed in a way that when looked at, you can already understand the purpose of what the architect intended with material choices and geometric decisions.Currently using it on my PC, but so far, it exceeds the Xbox 1 controller I have been at nearly all faucets. Only problem is that some companies like Ubisoft and Epic games seem to think no controller exists besides Xbox, so I sadly have to run Steam as an overlay to even use the dang controller. All in all, this controller is a shout-out to the PlayStation 1 with little Easter eggs and it really is a supremely constructed controller.

  I got this one day after ordering it, so I gotta give a shoutout to Amazon before I talk about it. Good job!Now then, the controller is so great for the system. If you have a PS5, you gotta check out the playhouse game with the robots to see all the features of it. At least the controller demo, if you don't wanna play the game itself. A rundown of improvements: theres a mic right in the controller and by default the auto output for people talking is also the controller with a button to press to mute yourself, the L2 and R2 triggers have potential traction to them so that certain games could make pressing the button hardee at points of they so desired, the controllers have newer charge ports (comparable to new andriod smart phones) that allow for faster charging, and the design is sleek with the touchpad reshape to the transparency of the buttons.

  Just when I thought you could not make a better controller than the Xbox Elite Series 2 controller, Sony releases this.It feels so good in your hands. The texture on the rear (made of the coolest tiny O, Triangle, X, and Square imprints) adds this premium feel to it. I wouldn't call the controller heavy nor light. It's balanced.The gyro sensor works as expected. Perhaps a little more accurate than the PS4, but I couldn't tell. However, the haptic feedback is very impressive. Mileage will vary depending on developer implementation, but it makes a big difference when used. (Especially in games like Dirt 5)The rear triggers also have haptic feedback and they add to the immersion too. Tried them in various games, including Call of Duty, and they do make a difference. That said, they are not so intrusive so as to demand your attention and be a distraction.The sticks feel like they're made of better quality materials than the PS4 controller had too.

  I can NOT believe this controller does not come with a cable.  Maybe if it was the PS4 kind (don't get me wrong, I am glad they went with C) it would make more sense, but even if the console comes with ONE cable, it also comes with a controller, so you still won't be able to charge them both at the same time........Otherwise I like the feel and the fact that it is heavier.  I wouldn't normally take off so many stars for a cable, but it just smacks of a HORRIBLE executive decision that needs to be pointed out.  Many of us do not have USB C cables laying around.  Once again, I can't wait for USB C to be the industry standard for everything, but it is too soon for them to start assuming we have them.

  This is a very well crafted controller and as argued by online reviewers is likely going to be one of the distinguishing factors between Series X/S and PS5. The PS5 controller can produce more accurate haptic feedback and supports pull tension for¬†L/R buttons, which can be programmed by developers to enhance the gaming experience (like simulating ABS brakes in racing games¬†or a jammed gun in shooting games). Though it is yet to be seen if all games can leverage these features or it will be mainly supported by the 1st party games.The PS5 controller is slightly larger/heavier than PS4's controller and has a USB-C port (instead of a micro-USB). There are tiny patterns of playstation symbols all over the back of the controller which gives it a nice look and feel. First impressions: I like it! I will edit my review once I receive my PS5.

  I thought to try this out as I am always looking for a more comfortable controller to play 3rd person action games on my pc.  The dualsense is a wonderful controller as it's relatively light, the battery lasts many hours, in steam you can customize the lights on the top, the buttons are easy to press, and the connectivity via bluetooth is great.  My xbox elite controller is largely gathering dust at the moment.  I've also added a magnetic tip cable and usb-c adapter (bought separately) so I can just snap a magnetic head cable on to it to charge for the night when I'm done playing.

  I always thought Playstation did great controllers.  This is another step up.  Heavier and broader than PS4, but they fit your hands great.  Mic and Speaker for chat if you don't want to wear a headset.  Nice share button and great trigger updates.  The batteries last a long time, at least at first.  I would say like 9 or so hours it seems like.  Maybe that is too long but really seems like I play 2-3 days on these before charging.  But you want to have 2 of course, so that is why I bought this.

  I just wanted to drop by this short review saying that PS5 Controller hepatic feedback or Dualsense is game changing.So to put it in the simplest terms. You know when it rains and the thunder hits the ground and you feel that vibration in your feet. Well imagine that feeling that in your hands. Thats just mind blowing how they achieved it.Overall it feels premuim but still in very small ways reminds me of holding a xbox duke from by gone ages.

  Love the new PS5 controller. The active response of the triggers is one of the best features they could have included.Comparing it to the PS4 controller * Larger, frame. The grips go a little deeper as well. If you have bigger hands this is way more comfortable.* the buttons have a lower clicking threshold.  You only have to click about half as hard which can feel weird at first but it's better.*Construction is very solid, great plastics . I've always been happy with my PS controllers they are built to last.My only disappointment is that PS5 controllers do not currently work on PS4.  Oddly enough they will work on a PS3.  This is a software issue and not a hardware issue, i'm sure this will be worked on in the future.

  This is a great controller. Big improvement over the PS4 controller. The vibration functionality is much more subtle and the controller itself feels great in the hand. Better size for my hands. The controller feels much more stable in game than other controllers I've used. Honestly, it's the most noticeable part of the PS5 experience so far. The interface and how it pulls you into the game seems much more significant that updated graphics, etc. I love this controller. However, after using it for a couple of days the ""X"" button started to stick. Also, the port for the earphones causes crackling and fuzzy noise. I've tried the headphones on my old controller and they are fine. So, it is something with this controller. Maybe I got a dysfunctional one, which is bound to happen. I am exchanging the controller and hopefully the replacement will be much better. Maybe I was unlucky and got a lemon.

    THIS REVIEW IS FOR PC - STEAM
  
",5.0,Mert,"Reviewed in the United States November 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  Well, there's honestly not much to say. Steam has native support for Xbox One, DualShock 4, and Switch Pro Controllers, so they will most likely, eventually, also develop for the DualSense. I'm not sure when that will be, but I trust Steam with that, since they had done an absolutely PERFECT job for the previous three.Connecting it to PC was insanely easy, just hold SELECT and PS buttons for 3 seconds until the lights flash rapidly, intermittently, and select the controller as a Bluetooth Device on Windows.It did not work immediately on Steam, I had to go into Big Picture (obviously) and configure it from there. What I did was register it as a generic controller by inputting each key for each action. It was honestly pretty simple, since Steam also shows you a picture of a controller and a green light for the current key you need to map.After mapping the keys, I played some Dead Cells, and the experience was pretty flawless. The controller feels GREAT in my hand. It feels like an Xbox One controller... but with the DS4 layout. It has some satisfying heaviness to it. Not that much, but you can definitely feel a good ""fullness"" in your hand when you compare it to a DS4. The shoulder, and especially trigger buttons feel better, too, since they are a bit larger now.I do have a problem with the SELECT and START keys... they are really stiff. If you have a DS4 with those keys being stiff... oh yeah, these are even stiffer. Still clickable, but very stuff. Perhaps they will become less stiff over the time the more I use the controller, but we'll see.However, some things are not customizable yet, like the DS4 is, such as changing the little light, or its color, and the touchpad. and its clicks. There's also a new button on the DualSense, which is the Mute Mic button as far as I know, and that's not mappable, either.Again, Steam will most likely develop native support for the DualSense also, but for now, it works just like an Xbox Controller, and that's enough for me for now.I have not tested the battery life yet, and I have no charged it yet, it already came with some charge (not sure if 50% or 100%).So far I'd say I'm satisfied, and I'll update my review if anything happens (whether good or bad).

  I got this for use as a PC gaming control for steam so I will review it from that view. First off, seems DOES support this controller, you simply have to opt into the beta updates which are both easy and do not cause any major issues with your other games or steam. It pairs well with PC Bluetooth, RGB color control works, and all buttons, rumble support is basic atm, there is no gyroscope or adaptive trigger resistance at the moment but they are being worked on. Even without those features I still love this controller! I've been a strict Xbox controller user since the original Xbox and even enjoyed the layout when it was on Dreamcast, but Sony has really nailed everything with this controller. The feel of it, the responsiveness, and joystick movements are all fantastic. I feel like it's what the Xbox controller should have been like. Definitely give it a try.

  I've used every playstation controller starting from the original ps1 without analogs. This feels the sturdiest and most well put together, is comfortable, and the haptics and trigger functions are very cool. I'm happy with Sony's continued excellence.

    Terrible Controller

  Get this controller if you want to have right analog drift or static problems. I can't go 5 minutes before the controller starts moving by itself. I'll move left or any direction and the controller will force itself to go any other direction besides the direction I want it to go.

    Not compatible with PS4

  Bought this before the release of PS5 thinking they would be backward compatible. Would not connect to my Gen1 PS4. I'm sure its a nice controller though.

    Best console controller!

  Hands down the absolute best gaming controller I‚Äôve ever used. Sony nailed the quality, grip angle, haptics, and the resistances in the triggers. It COMPLETELY makes the PS5 experience.
