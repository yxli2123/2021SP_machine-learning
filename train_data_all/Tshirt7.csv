    Well made, very nice cotton t-shirts. But, they shrink very much
  
",3.0,Elizabeth,"Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2019","









  
  
    
  These words too small for a small man and fit my fourteen-year-old daughter who wears a size 0. They shrink too much! But, the T-shirt quality is excellent and well made. Just purchase a size that is at least one size bigger since it shrinks so much.

  These v-neck t-shirts are very comfortable and I am happy with the fit and feel. The reason for the 3-star rating is because the shirts have a yellowish tint and I was really hoping they were notably whiter. When wearing a white dress or other shirt, it is easy to see the off-white/yellowish color of these shirts. Unfortunately, using bleach to help with the color was in successful.

  In general, I’m a picky shopper in terms of quality, but when it comes to undershirts, I only need something of decent quality but at a good price.As a point of reference, for my own use, three Calvin Klein v-neck undershirts at Costco for $19.99 cost more than what I felt was necessary for me (they are definitely of better quality though).So I found these Gildans and gave them a try.  The fact that they cost less than $2 per undershirt worried me so I wasn't expecting much, but they are actually better than expected, given the very reasonable price!  I laundered them once before wearing one, and my initial impression is that they fit great (I ordered Medium size, and I’m a size 39 chest & 33 waist) and are of very acceptable quality considering the price.I then compared them to some old Costco Kirkland V-neck T-Shirts that I’ve had for a very long time.  These Gildans are a lighter thinner cotton, so their durability wash after wash remains to be seen, but I initially have absolutely no complaints for the price.The Gildan cotton definitely feels rougher than the Kirklands, but not enough to prevent me from buying more Gildans for the price. The stitching on the Gildans is not as smooth or refined as the Kirkland’s, but again totally acceptable given the price point.In the end, as long as you aren’t shopping for premium quality, IMHO I feel this is a very good deal on a set of 6 acceptable quality undershirts, and I found them even better than expected.  If durability holds up after a reasonable amount of washes, I definitely plan to buy these again.

  I don't think I'm saying anything that hasn't been said in other reviews. The sizing of these shirts is pretty inconsistent. One will fit great, another is super long, another has a huge neck hole, another has short sleeves, etc. They also attract animal hair like I've never experienced before. i feel like a wookie by mid-day. I don't think I'll buy these again.

    Excellent V-Neck T-Shirts

  I was in desperate need of some shirts and got these on the fly.  I was impressed with the quality & quantity. for the price. The cotton is nice to the touch and breaths well. As with anything cotton I recommend adding some vinegar to you r cold wash the first time to help set the colors. I did not and they faded just a little bit. That is no bad mark on the vendor though. Overall very good shirts.  Top notch.

    Finally a V-Neck that my husband loves!
  
",5.0,Dana Runge,"Reviewed in the United States March 17, 2021","









  
  
    
  My husband is very picky about his “undershirts”. He usually wears “wifebeater” tanks under his dress shirts but could never seem to get them the right length. I first bought a pack of white V-Neck t-shirts to see if he liked them. He did!  Then I bought a pack of multi-colored and it’s all he wears now. He even wears them without dress shirts over them. Score one for me and for Amazon!  I’ve washed them several times and as long as he lets me separate the white ones from the colors, they all look brand new. I use Oxi-white with all my white loads and it even gets out whatever he spilled on his shirt. It’s rare that he doesn’t have a spot of something on his t-shirt by the end of the night but these all wash up and look brand new with no fading or shrinking. Very happy with this purchase and will definitely reorder when he needs more. Thank you!

This is the first time in my life(78 years ) that I  have ever bought underclothes from any one other that JC Penney.  The Penney's quality hasdipped drastically in the past decade so I made a change.  It  looks like so far the quality here is like Penney'sfrom 25 years ago.

  These are the most uncomfortable T-shirts that I've ever bought (first Gildan purchase here). They are also a little big in the midsection area. I washed them in hoping they would shrink and feel softer too...they didn't. The material is so uncomfortable on the skin. I tried giving to my teenage son and he didn't want them either. lol! We threw them away. I would suggest not buying. Very disappointed with this brand and won't be buying Gildan anything ever again.

  Purchased these fory 15yro who wears mens small. They arrived questionably small looking initially and then shrank on top of that. On some of the shirts, the V-neck collar seems disproportionately deep to the size of the shirt. These men's small shirts fit my slim 13yro son who just started wearing boys size 14-16. However, he doesn't like them. This is my least pickiest child who is very open to whatever clothes I buy him. He said the fabric felt irritating on his arm hair, it fit strange on his body (he's average body structure, healthy weight) the sleeves were also very short on him and he couldn't stop trying to pull at them like they must be stuck folded up. They resemble women's cap sleeves. I am real irritated because I needed a bulk of shirts quickly for my 15yro who had a growth spurt, bought both variety packs of these shirts and basically have a ton of junk shirts. Why is it so hard to get basic shirts?

  Purposely bought a 2XL after seeing all the reviews that it’d shrink. Out of the package, it felt soft. And thin enough for breathability. I quickly tried it on and naturally it was big since I’m actually XL size. Luckily since the package had 3 black shirts, I washed one of it then put in dryer. It did shrink as the others suggested. But luckily, not by much for me. So when I wore it, it did fit a lot better. I’m okay with the fit as it borderlines snug to fits as expected. And the length is still slightly below the belt which is my preferred at least although usually I like it a bit longer.

",5.0,Sarah Sheppard,"Reviewed in the United States August 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have a hard time finding cheap shirts for women, so that't why I decided to try some men's shirts. These are surprisingly soft, and I think they are cut more like a women's shirt than men's. They're slightly slimmer than the typical men's/unisex t-shirt (I wear a size 14 top in women's but usually a men's L is comfortably baggy on me), so the lower section clings a little to my lower abdominal region  (my measurements are: 44.5"" bust/38"" underbust/39"" waist/47.5"" hips). The v-neck seems a little deep for a men's shirt, and the sleeves are a little shorter than most men's shirts too. I like them quite a lot! However, next time I order, I will get size XL so I won't have to worry about shrinkage in the laundry.

  I bought both the Amazon essentials and the Gildan v neck black Ts. Both are soft and comfortable but which is better. After a wash, both shrinks a little so the feel is good and hugs your body. The black on the amazon essential is a bit darker when place next to each other. The Gildan looks a bit faded, not that it is, but next to the amz essential it does look it. The amz essential is thinner and maybe it's that that causes it to feel softer. Amz essential is also smoother, feels a little like there's polyester mixed it. Gildan is thicker and does feel you get more cotton for the piece. I kept both, since both are worth keeping. Price for Gildan is better tho.

  This is a great set of basic tee shirts.  I got these for my husband because he only usually gets the ""top quality"" tees.  He actually likes these.  They aren't the best that you can find of course, but they do what they are supposed to.  The fit is exactly as described.  They hold up after washing and they are great for wearing under sweaters.  My husband even wears these on hot summer days now.  They aren't as heavy as some others, but sometimes that's a better quality.  I wash them in cold water and air dry them to insure that they don't shrink and they haven't lost their color.  These are a great value and I think that they are good for some use by all men.  They are a great value and I recommend them for anyone.

  Based on previous experience with 100% cotton T Shirts, I purchase one size larger than I wear so when I wash and dry the shirts they shrink to a perfect fit.  Worked  again so don't hesitate to buy the Gildan shirts.  The material is soft and mostly wrinkle free.  The fit is roomy and comfortable.  The seams appear to be well sewn. The V is more of a deep V so if you want shallow V cut on the neck you may not want these.  I like them.

  I’m a woman and I bought these to go to the gym since I like to wear plain clothing and don’t really like tight shirts. I’ve washed these on several occasions and have given these heavy use. They are still in perfect condition and the price was excellent considering how long they have lasted me! I know these are for men, but the V-Neck and the colors were exactly what I needed. It looks pretty feminine on me, but I don’t really care considering it was just for the gym. I did buy a size small because Gildan usually has large sizes. In women clothing I usually wear a large, but I know in men’s sizes I am a small. I honestly highly recommend these!

  I like these shirts and I will definitely buy more, but they are a little thin, which could be great for the summer heat. I wouldn't wear them without another shirt on top, because they are a little sheer. They are a stretchy type, so if that's not the texture you're looking for avoid them. I was not expecting it, but it feels very comfy and for that, I would recommend them.

  My main concern was if before wearing this shirt it was going to shrink, but it did not happen. I like the cut and fabric used for it and does not feel hot or uncomfortable when moving, sitting, or picking something up from the floor. As a first wash, its color did not fade out which is a big plus for wearing it a home or around the block.

  I'm unsure if these shirts are actually sold/produced by gildan. I'm 5'9 and 165 lbs. I wear medium tops across the board and I'm highly disappointed in this product. The length of the shirt runs halfway down from my waist to my knees. The shirt has too much space as if this size was made for a large/xl person. The black is faded and weirdly enough, the rest of the shirts in the pack are all different shades of black. These were supposed to be my work shirts and now i pretty much have to use VNECK t-shirts as a strict casual indoor shirt. These aren't wearable in a public/social setting....very disappointed and won't be buying these on Amazon any more.

  At first, these undershirts did fit a bit too loose. However, after a few washes, they have been “broken in” and fit much better. They are fairly comfortable, and fulfill their purpose of providing an undershirt for button up shirts without showing much and making for a good, professional appearance for work or special events. I’d recommend these for those who will have the patience to wash these a few times to get the best fit.

  These aren't great. The sleeves constantly fold up, along with bottom of the shirt. The cut of the fabric at the bottom of the shirt is not fitted, and as shown in the images, pops out away from the body. I'm a 6'1"" slim lad, and they make me look like I put on a few pounds around the belly. Next Level, my old T shirts off Amazon are much much better, for only slightly more. I'll be turning these into some oil rags for the cars.  They also shrink quite a bit.

  Got these for my boyfriend so he would stop wearing his nicer t-shirts when he does car, yard, or handy work. A nice cheap option for when you know you just need a shirt you can get dirty without feeling bad. They were initially a really deep v-neck, Which he was not a fan of, but after washing them they shrank just enough to lessen the v and now he likes them. Fabric does feel a little scratchy, so he says they aren’t the comfiest, but not bad enough to mind too much.

  Got them for boyfriend, unfamiliar with brand (LG assorted color, 5pk for $5) and the fit was true to the chart. They taper well from the chest down to the waist, and the bottom hem hasn't wrinkled or flipped up. It is a bit of a ""deep V""  than other undershirts but that's what I was looking for.

  I bought these for going to the gym and they are serving their purpose well. I usually order Medium but I decided to go with small - glad I did. I still have plenty space in the shirt - it doesn't fit tight on my anywhere and is not too short or too long - it rests just above my hips. My only concern (which isn't a huge concern unless you're wearing these out somewhere) is that the black seems to be fading after just a couple washes. Aside from that, I'd definitely order again!

  My husband loves undershirts – he wears them all day, and then they become his home t-shirts once he’s lounging. He has been a long fan of the Calvin Klein shirts, then moved to Polo and was also impressed with LaCoste. I liked that this variety pack included grey, black and white V-necks, and he immediately was impressed with the quality… I even ordered another set. But I wish that I had waited until after washing them. Once they are dried in the dryer, they tend to shrink in the arms in an odd way. Whereas most shirts seem to get shorter, these have seams that seem to constrict in the armpits, making the shirts uncomfortable. This is super disappointing, but the issue doesn’t seem to happen if you line dry them instead.

  Not sure why there are multiple reviews stating the shirt sizes run large.  I am in between sizes (M and L) and these review comments on sizing persuaded me to order size M shirts.These shirts ended up being true size mediums, and too small even for my skinny 5’11” frame.  Noticed slight color fade after initial rental wash with less than normal amount of detergent,So deducting one start from five for this reason.  Shirt thickness is solid, more than Amazon Basics black shirts that arrived at the same time.  Due to the thickness, these shirts are not elastic like Amazon Basics black v-necks.Ended up giving these 5 shirts to two friends during weekly basic sessions.  Fits friends in the 5’6” to 5’9” height range just right.

They feel nice and crispy just like I like them.Wal-Mart is no longer carrying Gildan. I think they're using their house brand, ""George"". Just like Fruit of the Loom, Hanes, etc....wayyy too long and straight cut. I can stretch out the Gildan shirts at the bottom and they stay stretched out at the hip. Great for sleeping in and I even wear them to work with a sweater or light jacket over it (if I wear it alone, I iron it). I like the stiff cotton, the crispiness helps when i'm melting down from hot flashes. Great buy.

  For V-Neck lovers this is perfect, I was worried after some times in the washer machine would become loosen as I read in the comment section in amazon, but it holds up enough after 4 times washed.I would like it to be thicker because It doesn't seem too resistant to tough uses, so I wouldn't use it for the gym or go out hiking. I only use it at house, office or going to the movie theater.

  The art of the undershirt is disappearing, and heat strokes will come for the younger men.  The V-Neck of this shirt ensures it will not be seen while wearing a polo or button down with the top button undone.  The Cotton will absorb you sweat and as the sweat is evaporated it will help cool you off.  V-Necks were never made to be worn alone, but under a real shirt.

  The neck line on these t-shirts is cut too low.  The neck line seems to also lose its shape/form more after washing a few times.  The shirts are on the baggy side as well, I was hoping they would have shrunk a little, but they didn't.  I will still probably wear them as undershirts (because I am cheap and can't return them), but I would opt for a higher quality shirt if I were to be shopping for shirts today.

  You can also tell they changed it because inside the tagless area, the logo is larger (i did a side by side comparison). Must be a new factory. The only reason I always purchased this brand was because I could wear it casually with a small V neck. I used to wear these white V-necks with jeans. That was my James Dean style. Because I personally don't like the feel or look of crew necks. Now the really long V looks slobby to wear out. They never should have changed it. Be warned. Also, it a size larger than expected. The Medium is longer. Almost a Large.

Would I buy again YES these are for running around, doing yardwork, working out.  Not stylish just good function.  The only problem was the sulfur smell from the piece dyed fabric.

Unfortunately, the shirts were very large around the waist and under the belt-line. Like, 6inches too much fabric, meaning it pushed out the dress shirt and was a large bundle of uncomfortable fabric underneath. Another case of ""made to fit the average"".

For what I paid, they will work out for doing work around the house maybe, maybe an undershirt otherwise its in a donation pile somewhere, but I wouldn't invest in these shirts again. Sometimes it pays to invest more in something you can try on first.

  If you're the kind of guy that goes in public wearing a fake gold chain around your neck and fake Rolex on your left wrist the V-neck t-shirt is perfect for you. If you're the kind of guy who fondles his fake gold chain with his left hand whilst caressing his fake Rolex with his right hand the V-neck t-shirt was made specifically for you. If you're not this kind of guy you should steer clear of the V-neck t-shirt as to not be confused for the kind of guy who wears v-neck t-shirts.

  I wear V-neck t-shirts under my dress shirts every day.  I was very happy with the Kirland V-necks t-shirts, but they stopped making them.  I saw the price on these and decided to give them a try.  When I put the first one on right out of the package, I was pleasantly surprised.  They fit about as expected, maybe a slightly big in the chest and shoulders, but that's ok.  I would prefer that over being too tight.  After week 1, I was happy with my purchase.  However, one wash cycle (on cold, and then straight to hanger to dry, no dryer), they completely lost their shape.  I did not notice them shrinking at all, but they did not hold their shape at all.  On the second wash, I decided to try them in the dryer on a low setting, which made no difference.The bottom line is that in this case, you do get what you pay for.  A poor quality t-shirt that just doesn't hold up.  I won't be buying these again.

    Gildan V-Neck T-Shirts - Great Product/Great Buy
  
",5.0,zofoman,"Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2018","









  
  
    
  I bought the Gildan Men's Assorted V-Neck T-Shirts Multipack in 2XL for ease of wearing because of an upcoming major shoulder surgery.  I normally wear an XL in T-shirt sizes.  This was a good choice with the v-neck and extra sizing which allowed me to wear/change with little difficulty following surgery.  The shirt material is what I would call a comfortable medium weight and has held up well from  multiple washings with slight shrinkage over 2 months time.  All in all a great buy and a great product that got me through my immediate needs.  I would highly recommend this product for anyone contemplating shoulder surgery and to buy one size larger than their normal size.  Otherwise, pick your normal size.Edit Update:  Did a hot wash & dry on the 2xl to see if could get to shrink closer to an xl.  They did shrink some...more vertical than around, if that makes sense.  They are still a little large for me.  Will be good for knocking around outside in warmer weather.

  You can’t beat the price for the number of shirts included in these packs. I like that the shirts do not have sewn in tags and they are printed on the fabric and they hold up very well with daily use. The only recommendation I would make is to wash them I cold water and don’t dry them on the highest heat seating. This will prevent them from shrinking quickly over time.

  Purchased these plain white v-neck t-shirts to make tie dye shirts. They are a good weight for our Florida weather... not too thin, not too thick. I saw some people concerned that they received opened packages. Mine was completely sealed and never opened. The shirts are good quality, seams look well sewn and they washed well. I'm sure they will hold up for many washings. Would definitely purchase again.

  I bought these as I wanted a v-neck that has a very shallow V.  The pics of this shirt make it look quite shallow, and while it's definitely shallower than some, it's still pretty deep.  My wife says it makes me look like I'm wearing scrubs.  If these necks were an inch or two shallower, I'd love it, but it just looks funny on me.

  First time I followed reviews over experience and I FAILED! Those shirts had way more great reviews compare to the Amazon essential shirts, that's the reason why I bought them. I use undershirts almost every day for work purposes and decided to give those a try, instead getting the Amazon essential shirts agin, which I already have and love! Big mistake, those shirts are not even close as soft as all other shirts I had before (Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Amazon essential, Nautica etc.). Not comfy because the material is not soft at all, wouldn't recommend them.

  3 Stars because of how these fit.I’m 5’9, weigh about 160 lbs. and wear a 30 waist. I ordered medium. These shirts were huge out of the package. Gave em all a wash and dried em on ‘high heat.’ They shrank up quite a bit, which is what I wanted, but the length is now up close to my waist, and the width seems to be tailored more for heavier set midsections. Pretty baggy shirts even after the high dry.The quality is definitely 5 Stars for the price and I did receive a total of 5 shirts 👍If I were to buy these again, I’d probably order small and refrain from throwing em in the dryer.

  I'm gonna be fair here and say it's a decent tee, but I usually buy the Jockey brand, and I get the large and then it shrinks to sort of a M/L, which is perfect for weekends. So I ordered these expecting the same thing, but these don't shrink, so I'm swimming in them. I suppose you could say that's a good thing and if you need a really large fitting tee this is the one to get, but if you are expecting some shrinkage, don't buy.

  You can't argue with the price. At first, I was hesitant on buying it because there seem to be a lot of negative reviews, but I purchase it nonetheless. I'm not sure if they've improved their quality control, or I just got a ""good batch"" but, I'm glad I bought it. I had absolutely none of the problems that the reviews mentioned (holes, uneven sleeves, fabric unraveling, etc).The only issues I've had is that it seemed a bit short after washing it, possibly due to shrinkage? It's also a bit loose around the waist- doesn't hug your waist as closely as other shirts. I think this that's because the material isn't too flexible. It doesn't really bounce back well aside from after having been washed & dried. It actually has a habit of rolling up slightly at the very end which almost makes me feel like I'm wearing a crop top at times. Maybe buying a size higher would be a fix for this. One thing I should also note is that they aren't all that soft, but you have to remember how much you're paying for it.Also, it doesn't have that finish that other companies are doing now to prevent it from picking up smells.

  Don't get me wrong, I am NOT saying not to buy these t-shirts, just know that when you get 5 t-shirts for $12 , well they are not exactly top shelf. I bought these as an experiment having purchased Gildan before (bought extra heavy t-shirts and they were great) and thinking maybe these might be about the same quality. Not the same.Cotton is pretty thin. Neck opening seems a little large and sleeves seem a little short. Fit about right (I like my shirts a little snug but I know what is too tight). 3 black, 1 light grey and 1 dark grey. The back shoulder seam on the light grey came apart after just a few hours of wearing (I was not doing anything strenuous).Going to keep these as work shirts.

  I feel like these are a great price, very comfortable, and fit great: they wear well under my dress shirts for work. That being said, after the first wash (I received these yesterday), a hole was already in one of my shirts. A little disappointing, and as I now see is a known issue. I hope the manufacturer see these and takes note, quality is important too. Probably will not buy again if this appears to be common issue.

But he looks great in it, and you can’t really beat the quantity for the price. Good quality too.

  The reason I gave the three stars on overall rating is as follows.  On two shirts the right side of the neckline is improperly cut.  This causes the neckline to have too much material on that side and it refuses to lie flat.  I found this to be the same on some of the white tee shirts I purchased for my husband.  This is a problem with the shirts even purchased in stores.  Only some of the shirts do not lie flat.  We do like the quality and the price.  Colors are nice too.All and all, just a flaw that we overlook but others may not.

The material isn't very high quality and I don't like that there is no seem on the side, as a result it hangs a bit awkwardly and isn't a very fitted look. But for $12 what do you really expect. I still wear it and it's fine however if you're looking for quality V-necks I'd probably recommend you look some where else and spend a little more doe.

  These shirts arrived unbelievably large; A size Large is much larger than a large in any other brand like J. Crew, Gap, Prana, Patagonia, any of Target's brands, etc.I washed them on cold, and then the absolute lowest setting on my dryer. The shirts shrunk to be about the size of a J. Crew Medium, despite being exposed to virtually no heat, and cold water.  I can't imagine what will happen when I wash them next.  But, what's really crazy is the differences in each shirt.  I had to throw one shirt away immediately after washing, because it was, no exaggeration, 4"" shorter than the other shirts.  It came down to above my belly button.  None of the shirts are symmetrical, and none of them fit or are sewn the same as the other shirts.  I assume these are hand made by people that are new to garment sewing. There are odd skipped and uneven stitches, which is something I've never noticed in any other factory produced garment. On top of all of this, these are paper thin shirts.  Wearing the white shirt as an undershirt under a plain white button up, and you can see right through both shirts; these are definitely not appropriate shirts to wear on their own.I'll be using these as undershirts, but I'm never buying anything from this brand again.  I have shirts from other inexpensive brands that were just a little more expensive that are far better in both fit and quality.

  Haines was my brand, I’m looking for better quality and reasonable price. I bought 12 of these good but falls short. They are thicker and have a good feel. The problem is the sowing. Two shirts sleeves came partially off. Therefore I had 3 arm holes on them. 3 other shirt developed small hole that grows each time I wash it. So out of 12 shirts 5 have gone bad after 3 or 4 washings. I read the other reviews so I purchased them. I wonder how quickly the reviews were written and how many time the shirts were washed. They are a little large but comfortable and soft. However I think it will be short lived, we will see. After 6 weeks of use of 12 shirts 40% are unwearable. Make your own decision.

Before washing, the length was perfect but the width was slightly too large. After the wash the length shrunk by almost TWO inches and the width shrunk by about one inch. I love the width, arms, and neck after the wash but the length shrunk too much that it can easily show my stomach when I raise my arms.Stuck with air drying it and having it a bit oversized or drying it and having it fit perfect except for the length.

  The shirts (despite other reviews) are very short. Much shorter than Hanes comfort soft by at least an inch. They are cut too boxy and the v-neck is extremely wide and not centered. I like plain shirts. I like inexpensive stuff. I've worn Hanes soft style until there vneck style changed about a year ago (its too deep now). I wear Anvil, Next Level and Tultex. These in no way compare to any. Just to make sure I wasn't crazy I went and bought regular hanes soft style to compare. No comparison! These Gildan shirts are trash.

If the quality of the t-shirt remains the same in 6 months to a year, I’ll most likely buy another pack in the future.

  I am just shy of 5'9"" which makes me below average in height in the US. The T-shirts are too short to be tucked in unless you are willing to always keep your hands at your side. I thought maybe I had gained too much weight over the last year but then I bought a 3 pack of Van Heusen undershirts at Marshall's. The undershirts were over 2 inches longer than the Gildan's. It felt so good to have a shirt that I didn't have to worry about. I just bought fruit of the loom ""stay tucked"" and they are more than 3 more inches longer than the Van Heusen. They are a dream. Unless you want to rock a mid-drift, I recommend another brand.On a positive note, the shirts are well made and held up in extreme working conditions.

  These fit okay but was disappointed with the neck opening, its very large and the neckline is too deep, not really what I was expecting from a V-Neck so probably won't order more, the quality is okay, very basic material this could be recommended as an upper layer for sleepwear but not really for wearing out. If you don;t like a large neck opening on shirts you may not like these.

  Simply needed a v-neck to wear under dress shirts for work.  I like the V-neck to reduce bulk around the neck when wearing a dress shirt and tie.  These work great for that purpose.  These are not wispy thin but have some thickness to them.  I personally don't wear V-necks by themselves, but these would be fine for somebody who does.  I recommend them due to their functionality for my purpose and saving a few bucks in the process.  I like that they are made in Honduras.

  I wouldn't recommend this product. It creates sooo much static cling and, even when so many dryer sheets are used, it still gets hair stuck to it. Any small lint or fuzz that it comes into contact with sticks to it for eeeever. It's so annoying. I cannot recommend this to anyone that doesn't want to spend hours picking off all the hair off it or enjoys lint rolling their shirts every hour.

  Just my 2cents here, but these are my absolute favorite for sleeping. Along with a pair of pajama pants or shorts...  they’re roomy, soft, wash well, and don’t shrink nearly as much as some brands do. I order mine a size or 2 up to be able to have that loose comfy fit. I always end up coming back to this brand-  some of the other brands H. and FOTL. shrink some with every wash/dry, and tend to thin out, becoming thinner and thinner from wash and wear. This brand holds up much better. (Keeping in mind that they’re worn and washed a lot because it’s the only shirt I like sleep in).

  I would have given this 5 stars because Ive bought Gilden clothing my whole life, but these were not soft, they're kind of itchy and super thin. Plus the sizes are not what the size chart in the images shows.  I have itn3 stars because I think this was a quality issue with these particular ones that slipped through QA's hands.  Because, every Gildan tshirt, hoodie, jacket and all the other products I've bought throughout my who life have been amazing quality at rock bottom prices.  This is why almost every custom shirt and hoodie design print shop use this brand.  Whosalers can get them for less than a dollar, and we get them for $3 to $6 usually but we dont have to set up and manage a Tax ID system to become a wholesaler. Most branded plain tshirts cost $25 up to $200 at some stores and you get the same product with Gildan for $3 to $6.  Both expensive brands and Gilden use cotton or different blends if you prefer to buy them and are both Tshirts.  A Tshirt is a Tshirt made of the fabric you choose, the only difference is name.  I also recommend Amazon Basics Clothing, it's high fashion, perfect fit and low cost.

  I've had several brands of V-neck shirts to wear with open-collared button-up shirts, but I cannot wear these Gildans that way.  The bottom of the V-cut is too high, and the T-shirt is exposed.  I would not have been permitted to wear these shirts when I was wearing uniforms with strict dress codes.  If the collar's button is used, the shirts won't be exposed, but in that case, a normal non-V-neck shirt would be OK.  They appear to be durable, but I can't rate longevity yet.

  Shirt length is important to me, as I prefer that my t-shirts stay tucked in throught the day, and are long enough to cover the waistline and tops of my front and back pants pockets if I wear them untucked. This shirt is perfect for both.These shirts are thick enough to stay wrinkle- resistant and not bunch up in areas of movement beneath an outer layer like a button-up or sweatshirt.As outerwear wear, I can wear a black a-shirt tucked in underneath it without the a-shirt printing through the weave of the v-neck.These shirts are exceptional.

  Shirts are fine. Fit as intended. Nice Quality.  However the heading clearly says ""5-Pack"".  The picture clearly shows 5 shirts. (3-Black, 1-White & 1-Charcoal).  The package I received was only 4 pack.  (the 3rd Black shirt was missing).  The ad is misleading. The heading says one thing (5 shirts) and looking back now at the description  (under the sizing chart) it only has 4 shirts listed.  (Color:  2 Black / 1 White / 1 Charcoal) .

  Sleeves/Arms too big.  Before washing and drying they were huge, but now it shrunk considerably. I’m a medium 180 pds, ordered medium was to small, exchanged for large was too big. Now we have washed a bit tight, it feels like a tight medium, but after a while they do expand. Have learned to stretch them prior of use. Not a great material but it will do for the price.

  So I normally wear a small or medium. I bought these as a size small, even though they say small is 34-36"" and I have a 38"" chest. But I got them to be undershirts, and they work great for that. It's maybe 5% a little tight at the armpit but so far I like it a lot. It's a little lower V than I normal like, but again, it's an undershirt, and you often can only barely see it under my button up shirts.I've washed and dried these on cool, and lost a little length but not much width. So--I'm a fan. The sleeves are short enough that I don't have to roll them up ever under my shirts. I often have to roll up sleeves with my other white shirts, so they don't stick out under the sleeves.

  These are nice shirts at a great value.  I would only recommend that they be worn as a true undershirt, as the thickness and finish don't really make them suitable for outerwear, in my opinion.  They make wonderful undershirts, however, and I am happy with this purchase.  I wear a XXL and I find that that the V-neck is a bit higher than on other, similar shirts, and as such can display slightly through an open collared shirt.  If that's a big deal for you, I'd recommend a Jockey T-Shirt or something else with a bit deeper of a V.

  I feel a little silly complaining about shirts that cost around $2 each, but here's what I don't like:  [-] the length shrank significantly after washing/drying, making it impossible to tuck in when worn as an under-shirt, and making it look ridiculously short as a standalone t-shirt.  [-] the sleeves are _really_ short (shorter than they appear in the product picture) with a too-large opening  [-] the material is coarse and scratchy.  It softens up a bit after multiple washings, but it doesn't exactly feel nice against the skin.  [-] I've never had a t-shirt come out of the dryer as wrinkly as these doOn the bright side...  [+] the shirts seem reasonably well made  [+] $2 per shirt is stupid cheap

  These shirts are ok, except for a few issues. They are heavier than I like, even though they specify lightweight. They don't feel soft to to touch, but feel ok  when worn. Also the v neck isn't big enough, and still tightens around neck some. These shirts are long, causing me to sit on tail, which is causing the neck line to ride up. This is fine as I like a long shirt tail. I just pull it up some when sitting, alleviating the tightness around neck. Again, ok shirts for only $3 a piece.

  Keep in mind that this t-shirt is good only as underwear.

It's long enough.The best thing about this t-shirt is that it's 90% cotton so you don't feel any discomfort wearing it and your skin doesn't get irritated.I don't recommend drying it in a dryer as it can get shrunken. It's better to hang it while it's still a bit wet and let it dry this way.

I don't mind the body being a little tight but they are too tight in the arm pits.  I will probably donate them and go back to what I know.

  For me these shirts ran not only big but EXTRA big, i weigh 200lbs and im only 5ft 9 and the large was the equivalent to an xxl for me. The shirts themselves were great no issues they have the tag printed on instead of a tag sewn on which is amazing, and for the price you cannot beat em. If i was to order these again i would get a medium or even try the small! i am using these as work shirts so it isnt really a big deal that they are big because i am expecting them to get dirty fast.

  At first I was very happy with these v-neck shirts that I was going to wear under my work shirt. After a couple of washes in luke warm or cold water, I noticed they had shrunk a little. When I tried on of the black ones on the other day, it felt tight and had shrunk even more. I have a long back and normally wear tall xl if I can get it but since I needed some undershirts quickly, I went with these ones. I guess you get what you pay for. I will pass them along to my local charity shop and go get some better pre-shrunk under shirts over the holidays.

  Despite the mixed reviews on this product about product quality and questionable fit, I went ahead and made the purchase because I really wanted black v-neck undershirts, and these were the highest rated shirts available.My experience so far (size L shirts) is that the fit is appropriate, the fabric is not ""thick"" like a normal t-shirt, but is thinner as you would expect for an undershirt, and the length is good for the shirt stayed tucked in your pants and not get pulled out during the course of the day.I will come back and update this review if something negative happens with the shirts.

  I've worn each of these 2-3 times now, and two of them already have fallen apart with holes under the armpits. Also, as others have mentioned, these shrunk a ton, and while the fit is fine elsewhere, the length of them is now comically short. I can really only wear them around the house. They are not very soft, and overall just poor shirts. Even though these are quite cheap, I'd suggest spending your money elsewhere.

  I got these for my work, and they fit quite well out of the box. They're 100% cotton, so it's probably helpful to block dry them the first time you wash them to avoid shrinkage. They seem to be durable, but they're light enough to wear during the summer in Texas while working in a warehouse. I was a little disappointed that the five of them were one light gray, one dark gray, and three black, would have liked to have more of the lighter colors, but that's my only complaint. Well worth the money.

  First off, quality of material is great for what was  $1.45 per shirt when I purchased them. The size however runs very large.  I am normally an X-Large so that is what I went with. These shirts are more like a XXL, for my 5'0 wife they go below her knees.  This is just my experience, hopefully yours is different.  If you happen to need t-shirt fabric these are outstanding as a crafts store would charge at least twice as much per yard.

  It's your basic black tee. It fits well and works under shirts or just as a regular black tee. We've put it through a few washes (cold) and it has not faded much nor has it shrunk.

Like that they are not so long as other brands I have. They cover but not like a dress. Sleeves also are not hanging down to my elbows but long enough to cover my upper arms.

  These shirts are at least a size larger than Hanes XL's.  They do have a chest size on the neck label (46-48) but I didn't know that when I ordered them. They are huge by comparison.  They are soft enough, but the stitching isn't very tidy.  In 3 or 4 places inside each shirt, there were pairs of unsecured loose threads dangling, about 1-1/2 - 2 inches long.  I tied them off so they wouldn't unravel while swishing around in the washing machine.On the plus side, the seams are covered across the shoulders  and the back of the neck.  Also, seams in the sides of the shirts.Check the numeric size before you buy-- 46/48, etc.;  the size number and size category (large, etc;) may not be in sync with other brands you buy.

",2.0,hi there,"Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought a pack of these in 'small', because I wear medium-size shirts. Even after shrinking in the wash, these shirts are still much larger than a 'small' should be. They're also not long enough to stay tucked. This leads to a surprisingly uncomfortable situation where my outer shirt has stayed tucked into my pants, but my loose undershirt has pulled loose and is bunched up at the small of my back.I would consider these to be acceptable outerwear (normal t-shirts), except that they're v-necks. So they're completely useless to me.Good quality though.

  Overall, I think the shirts are a good deal and decent value for the price. Unfortunately, one of the shirts arrived with a couple holes under the arm. I purchased these shirts for my partner as a gift, and inspecting each shirt for holes was not my first instinct when he opened them.He already wore one of the shirts, so I don't know if it's eligible for a return. The price is still reasonable for four shirts, but I have yet to look over the others. I'll update the review if I find more. Not sure if one shirt is worth an entire refund, but kind of disappointed they didn't all arrive in good condition. Without the holes, I would have rated 5 stars.

The shirts are very soft and stretchy and the vee neck is a proper depth. Gildan please make these in more colors. I've bought two sets already and they've held up great after several washes. If you're in the middle of two sizes, order a size up because these shirts shrink quite a bit. The terrific price makes them a winner. I love these shirts !!

  Received these t-shirts, and checked to make sure its 100% cotton as stated. Washed and put softener to ensure I get the most comfort but noticed the t-shirt seems, not as soft as most cotton t-shirts. Bought a second set from a different brand, and did the exact same thing, and the t-shirt was soft and comfortable. I may be critical, but I wear t-shirts all the time, so I'm not being picky, rather I'm basing my opinion on the comfort level. This was not up to par, and I'm wondering whether the cotton used for this t-shirt doesn't have the softness factor.

Just wish shirts were a tad longer cuz he saggs his pants. Other than that it fits ok. I'll start looking in Big and Tall clothing just for that reason. I need to find Tall and Skinny clothing.

  Gildan is usually a decent brand but one of the V-neck shirts I was sent in a multipack was cut and sewn extremely off. The neck hole was so small I can only fit my hand through, the way the shirt is sewn around the neck line makes it lay really strangely on the body... I know it's only 1 in the multipack that is defective but Gildan you need to improve your Q.A. dept.

    Thin undershirts. Lower quality. You get what you pay for.
  
",3.0,Honestly...,"Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  The description and reviews suggest these t-shirts may be worn as an outer “stand alone” t-shirt. These are thin undershirts plain and simple. I washed them in cold water and air (no heat) dried them. They shrunk overall about 15-20%. They shrunk 3.5 inches in length alone. The material thickness is VERY THIN, nearly see thru. The neck does not hold its shape. They came out of being air dried needing to be ironed before wearing. If you’re looking for a cheap undershirt and don’t care if they are thin and come out of the dryer very wrinkled, this is the undershirt for you. At $9 for six shirts they are a good value for what they are, but I should have expected this type of lesser quality, very light-weight, and thin material. If you Decide to buy these undershirts, you should order at least a size larger than you normally wear.

  The shirts I received were 100% cotton (as stated on each shirt) instead of a blend. That defeats the entire purpose of why I bought these.  There's a million other options for 100% cotton. These run a little big for a Medium and could be a little longer. That said they'll work for under shirts so I guess I'll keep them.

  T-shirts fit true and are very soft but also seem well made. The “v” isn’t very deep which I like. In other reviews it mentioned the shirts were “ding” or the “packaging was not very good.” I found neither of those situations with my purchase. However, there is a “window” on the front that allows you to feel the material that had a smudge but it washed right out. Overall I’m very satisfied with these Gildan v-neck t’shirts.

  First, to be honest, I returned these items because they ran just to small for this big guy.  My regular stafford t-shirts are XL in size. So I ordered these in XXL hoping they would be a little loose or at least leave a little room for shrinkage.  They were still way to tight all over.  These fit more like a slim cut.Having said that, I really liked the material and the cut and the seams/sewing.  Seemed to be reasonable quality for such a low price.

  The whole point of a v-neck t-shirt is the ""v"". When the Hem which makes that v is not wide enough, overtime, very little time, that V turns into in ugly u. That however it's not the case with these particular v-neck t-shirt. These will remain v-necks for the life of the T-shirt because of the  nice robot hem. Additionaly the t-shirts are slightly longer than normal, there is a very good reason for this. These t-shirts are 100% cotton and as you wash cotton, it off and shrinks. Most cotton t-shirts will shrink vertically but not always horizontally. You end up with a wide, short shirt. Again this is something that will not happen with these T-shirts because someone actually put some thought into the design. And it is a very good design, I have to say. If you're looking for v-necks these are the ones to buy.

  Fit a little strange. Mens shirts normally are tailored to fit mostly larger around the shoulders to accommodate the male shape but these not so much. Also for cotton they seemed pretty heavy. A wash didnt do much except for shrink them but it was already tight at the top so it made it worse.

  Based on your size chart I’m suppose to be an XL. When I tried in the shirts, they’re too big, I think your size chart is a little off. Can u be so kind as to send me the correct size, I should be a large. Thanks for ur understanding & help.

  Was significantly larger than other large-sized shirts from other brands.  Looks too ridiculous on me with the huge v-neck and tent-like shirt.  Now I know I should have bought the medium size but I don’t want to spend twice the money just for shirts that fit.  Maybe I’ll use these as emergency rags.  Too bad.

  I am really happy with the fit and style of these shirts. I use them to apply HTV and they do a great job. My only complaint is that one of the black shirts in the package has a hole. Not sure how I'm going to cover it up yet, but other than that annoyance these shirts have been great.

  This is a great price for a 5-pack.The tees are comfortably textured. They feel thick enough to be durable but not so much to feel constricting.  I'm female and love these. I just wanted something simple and comfy for daily wear. This is it.Because I am a bit chunky, I couldn't decide on a size. I figured Men sizes might run slightly larger so I went with an L size first. It fit but was tighter around my belly (my fault!). I know that I fluctuate in weight so I kept the Large and ordered more in XL. These are perfect for me.You can see that there is just a slight difference in the XL (black in photo) and the L (grey overlaying) tees. That difference was enough for my bust and belly.Still trying to figure out if the L/G = Large/Giant and the XL/EG = Extra Large/Extra Giant! LOL

  I have a few of these shirts from stores and they fit great. Ordered a size L like I usually get at a store and this particular manufacture runs very big. The V on this shirt is very excessive. It looks like a women’s shirt with the V from shoulder to shoulder and the back of the neck also lays very low below the shoulder line.

  I got these when they were 6$ for the multipack, i understand why. The shirts were oversized and inconsistent in quality and size. I got a medium ( 5'10"" 140lbs) and they were ridiculously wide, and the neck came down almost down to  my xiphoid process. It was a shame cause the deal seemed too good to be true, and i found out it was :/

  5 V neck shirts for $16?!I received package in amazon prime’s usual 2 day delivery.  All 5 shirts were rolled up, and taped for easiest possible shipment.  Went from package to washer & dryer.This is the 2nd shirt I tried.  So far, both shirts had extra string hanging down in armpit area, but that is common.  Do not rip those strings whatever you do!  You will create a hole near the armpit.  Instead, snip access string with scissors and problem solved.I’m still amazed how comfortable these shirts are compared to my closet full of Under Armour ones that cost about 8 times more. I usually wear Large, but ordered XL.  Thankfully, after washing the shirts in warm water, they fit like a glove.  I like these shirts are unbranded!!  If you are looking for a good fitted shirt, you get 5 for the price of 1 UA.  I will be buying the 5 or 6 pack of black V neck shirts today.  They also make these shirts in regular collar too.I will give 5 stars across the board due to price and comfort.

  I wanted these in a large but some of the reviews said the shirts shrink upon washing, so I purchased these in extra large. I wash new clothes before wearing them and after washing the shirts, they are still the same size. Now I did order the dark pack so they were washed on cold and I only dry on a medium heat setting. I mention this because shrinking probably happened if the shirts were washed and/or dried with hot water/high heat. I also live in Arizona and cold water in the summer is still quite warm/sometimes hot.I'm a female, 5'6 140lbs so the shirts are quite big but they dont droop off my shoulders or expose my breasts when bending over which I was afraid of. They do seem to attract lint, not a lot and nothing a lint roller can't fix. They still look nice if I at least tuck in the front, so I plan to wear them. Overall I'm pleased with these shirts, they're very comfortable and it's not their fault I ordered them too big.

  Ok so it is an undershirt and it is cheap so there is that. I understand what people are saying when they question if these are factory rejects. 1 of my shirts had a stain and the neck size was as if it was made for a different size shirt. I do think all the necks of each shirt vary in size (the product is inconsistent) but this one was way off. I might not have noticed the others being different if I wasn't specifically looking at them due to this shirt.Still they are better than the hanes I bought which I am trying to return due to their fabric being so thin it is see through.

  I bought the pack of t-shirt to wear with a bomber jacket. I like the color choices as they reflect to the pictures. My only gripe of the t-shirts as they are wide from the package. I mean the t-shirts are loose from the package. If you workout and/or in decent shape then they'll be loose. I threw one into the washer and they significantly shrunk and now they are more fitted to my body.If you like the shirt loose then buy your normal shirt size even if you throw them into the washer as they will fit a bit better/snug than from the package.
