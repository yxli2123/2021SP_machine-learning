    Fantastic Watch
  
",5.0,Kevin Blake,"Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2019","









  
  
    
  Fantastic for tracking your running or biking, really great for tracking and improving run times and pace as well. The heart rate sensor isn't the most accurate thing while working out, but I didn't get it for that so no big deal to me really. At rest the heart rate monitor seems pretty close to a good ol' pulse count. Sleep tracking is a little wonky as well. Sometimes the sleep times don't match up with reality, and there's a catagory for REM sleep, but I've had this watch for 4 months and never got a reading on it. Maybe I'm sleeping wrong and not ever actually getting any REM sleep?

  I bought this watch a month ago to track my heart rate & cardio while biking and playing pickleball. i am not a techi guru and i wanted something simple. I can track everything with two buttons before i start my exercise. After my workout I can sync it to my phone and i get a complete view of my heart rate. I think the step count is way more accurate than the Fitbit I had. Plus, I get notifications when I get a text, an email or if someone is calling me. It even tracks my sleep patterns. And I charge once a week with a simple charging cable- no battery to remove. Could not be happier with the watch.

  This product worked for exactly 7 days. When the battery was down to about 15-20% I put it on the charger for the night. Not only did it not charge but it drained the remainder of the battery charge and would not re-charge. I contacted Fitbit customer service and they were of little help and will replace only the instrument itself..I would still need to buy the charger etc....which would be an additional cost to me.

  I had my Forerunner 35 for 2 months, then it un-sync'd from my phone. I had to sync it back by resetting all the stored information. Less than 80 days with the watch, it no longer holds a charge.I look at  Your Orders on my Amazon profile and the last day to return the product was weeks ago. However, Amazon has a support feature to connect me to an ""expert"" (their word not mine).  I connect and am sent to a call center somewhere. The person asks my name and that's it. I heard lots of noise in the background but no one is talking to me. After a few hello(s), I hang up.After 30+ years of running, I only wanted to get my heart rate. Well, that was too much to ask. I will continue using my reliable app on my phone.Garmin and Amazon, you both let me down on this one. I am only out $99 so it is not a huge lost but I will be more skeptical with future purchases.

  I was planning to this watch for monitoring my pulse during workouts. The readings are erratic and completely irrelevant. I can feel my heartbeat going up, but that is not recorded at all or is delayed by several minutes. Sometimes it shows a very high heartbeat just prior to exercise. I tried wearing it at different locations on my wrist, but that didn't help. Also, the program is awkward. In short, a waste of money.

  I like this watch a lot, I seem to have an issue with the sleep tracker, I thought it would automatically know when I was sleeping but I guess not. For example when I take a nap it shows my heart rate drop into my sleeping heart rate but it’s not measured as me sleeping. So idk. But if it know when I plan on sleeping and is scheduled it records it fine. But if I sleep past my predicted time it doesn’t count it as sleep.But for all other purposes I love it! It works great for my runs, walks, and my cycling! I have not had it long but I’m already quite attached to it.Great battery life, it lasts for days, I’ve never run it dead yet but I’ve gone a few days without charging it at all.

  Tracks your work outs, steps, calories, sleeping, heart rate. Sync to your phone and get notifications. Battery lasts up to 9 days before you have to charge it. Also, it's waterproof. I personally don't wear it to bed because I sleep at weird angles and it cuts off the circulation in my arm. Plus, I don't know if it's the watch or me, but it doesn't track my sleeping patterns well. Sometimes it will say that I slept between 8 and 10 hours when I sleep less than 7 every night. Do I sleep with my eyes open? Anyway, great watch. I love it!

  Watch is exactly what I needed: heart rate, GPS, step counter, multi-activity function-and a few more features I do not use (text/call notifications &a weather). The App available for iPhones is such an easy and low-maintenance way of keeping track of marathon/Ultra training and mountain biking.

  This watch is a great motivator. I get out there even when I don't feel like it. HOWEVER the watch band is poor, very poor. It is silicone and held on to the watch body with screws.

  Great watch! For a hobby runner, this has all the features I needed. The different sport modes (outdoor run, indoor run, bike, cardio, walk) are well designed for any activity I would need. It connects quickly to the GPS and has been very accurate so far. At times it can take a bit of time to synch to the Garmin Connect app, but overall it works fairly quickly. Battery life is good, and the large number of wrist holes is perfect for any size.

    Economical Entry Level GPS Watch with Heart Beat Rate Built-In
  
",4.0,Emmanuel A. Garcia,"Reviewed in the United States October 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  THE GOODBuilt-in heart beat rate monitor. Very clear black and white display. Great, low economical price at about$70 for refurbished unit. Good sleep tracking. Even better running activity tracking with more stats than you're likely to know what to do with for a beginner. Waterproof. Almost good enough for swimming.THE BADGPS graph results are very spotty for swimming. This is a 2016 model that cannot be software upgraded very much and is not compatible with Garmin's new eco system of free apps. This is arguably the greatest deal breaker for me, the fact you cannot enjoy the new free apps. It is as if Garmin decided to abandon or kill the sales for the Forerunner 35 by dropping support for it via software upgrades. It is also possible that its small amount of RAM, chipset and older CPU simply can't handle more modern apps.

  A nice tool overall, it keeps track of all the basic activities you do during the day (sleep quality, walking, inactivity period, calories burned, ...), it's very user-friendly when you want to record your outdoor activities, but lacks the possibility to customize the list of preset activities or to use it as a simple stopwatch to record laps and times.It's useful to use it in conjunction to Garming Connect and Strava to set personal goals and keep your motivation going.As a semi-professional runner it has all the basic functionality you need and be totally satisfied.

  This watch has the basic useful features for runners trying to track and improve their results.  But, none of those features work properly.  In fact, this watch is almost useless.  I'm quite disappointed of Garmin and will not favor their products next round.I can go into details, but I went back to check the reviews and found that many are saying the same thing and explain this well.  I have no clue how it averages 4.5 stars.  Perhaps a large portion of them is crappy.

    Bargain fitness watch - recommended
  
",5.0,Neal A Cooper,"Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  This watch does everything I need in a smart fitness watch at about 20% of the cost of an Apple Watch. The functionality is not nearly as good as the Apple Watch, but did I mention that it’s only 1/5 the price? I was going to get the Apple Watch, but instead I got five of these Garmins for the same price. I love a good deal.The fit is comfortable. I wear it snug on my wrist to ensure the heart rate monitor is fully engaged. The health data is just as useful as what other fitness watchers offer, and will migrate across most major platforms to allow other apps to use the data as well. Don’t expect to respond to text messages without your phone, as the watch doesn’t do that. You’ll need to physically use the phone for that.The Garmin Forerunner 35 DOES, however, do the following quite well:It tells the time.It monitors your pulse.It counts your steps.It tracks your runs/exercise.It monitors your sleep.It shows recent texts/emails.It displays caller ID and allows remote answering.It reflects calorie burn statistics.It pairs with weather apps.It makes coffee in the morning.If you’re looking for a smart fitness watch that does all the above, get yourself a Garmin Forerunner 35 and a Starbucks card and go live your best life. Recommended!

    Watch is nice but the wrist band broke
  
",1.0,John K,"Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  I had the watch for 3 months and the band broke. It is a weird band too so it is not easy to replace, there are some custom screws on it.  Pretty pricey watch product to have a very flimsy and cheap band on it. You can get cheap products for less money.Follow up after Garmin sent me a new band - I waited a few weeks for a replacement band from Garmin at no cost. They only had one color available and it took weeks to get the new band, pretty poor service. I put the new band on and it broke as well after two months. This is a custom band so you cannot replace it with a quality band easily. I suggest another product due to the poorly designed wrist band it comes with.

    Good simple GPS for running - not good for step counting
  
",4.0,EM,"Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  Was looking to replace a Timex GPS watch for running that was several years old. Have used this for over a month. The GPS function is great compared to my old watch - finds signal quickly and never drops (although almost always sunny when I’ve run). The only major miss is that when it buzzes at the end of a mile, it only displays your time for that mile and not total time elapsed - so you have to wait several seconds to see total time again.I’ve never worn a step counter and was excited about that function on this watch, but it’s been inaccurate many times - a few times I’ve walked several blocks without it recording any steps. Maybe it’s user error, but I would not recommend this watch if that function is a priority for you.Overall good simple GPS watch - accurate and easy to read while running.

  Love it! It does all I could ever ask for. Quick charge, and I get days worth of runs out of it. However, during half-marathon training it did need to be charged more often. But still lasted me anywhere from 3 to 7 runs depending on time spend and how long GPS was being used. The worst thing, and it may be my phone not the watch, is pairing and keeping it paired with my phone. Keeping the text and phone call notifications off helps with battery life immensely.

  I tried this both on a marked running trail and also the track.I love the heartrate monitor feature but the pace is unreliable.When I used it to run 2.0 miles on a 400 m track, the 2.0 miles recorded about 50-100m past the finish line. I compared it to my friend's Garmin F235 and his 2.0 miles ended exactly on the finish line. Due to the error in estimating distance, my pace per mile was much slower than actual. I returned this watch as the most important variable for training and races for me is pace, not heartrate. My old Garmin F15 was very accurate in pace/distance.

  The strap that keeps the band from flailing around broke after less than a year, so now I have to either give up on the watch or be constantly annoyed at it, which is frustrating. I cannot think of any good reason why it would break, there was no undue stress on it.Otherwise it was a pretty good watch. I got it to track runs and it performed decently at that, except for a few times when it couldn't get a GPS lock for some reason.

  This is my third smart watch. The first was a Garmin Vivosmart HR+, which I had for four years, was an OK watch. The second was a less expensive watch with decent reviews on Amazon. I returned that watch after a month of trying to get it to work properly. The app for the watch was poor and after reinstalling the app a few times and completely resetting the watch, I decided enough and returned. This new Garmin WORKS right out of the box. The application works well and the watch took a couple of days to get used to, but I am very pleased with the overall experience. I ride 50+ miles a week in 5 plus events.  My only concern is the accuracy of the milage. I have used Map my Ride in the past and when I have compared the two after the exact same ride, Garmin app shows I have ridden almost 10% farther, plus burned 50% fewer calories? I know the calorie burn is an estimate, so I'm not overly concerned, and I try and ride an additional mile to make up for the difference.

  I had high hopes for this wrist heart rate/GPS unit.  I am a runner of over 35 years.  I  have used quite a few heart rate monitors and this one is the least accurate.  I have a resting heart rate of 42 that has been confirmed by holter monitor and multiple chest strap heart rate monitors.  This Garmin gave me a resting heart rate over and over again at 30 bpm to 35 bpm.  I used it's GPS on a bike ride and a couple of runs in conjunction with my iPhone GPS along a route I have tracked with my car odometer and my iPhone many times and in 3 miles the GPS from the Garmin was just under 2 tenths of a mile short of what I know to be an accurate distance.  That would put the GPS from this unit off by over a mile in a marathon.I would have given it a 1 star rating but it is easy to read and the buttons for me were easy to use.Not recommending this product.

  Super lightweight. Battery last for about 6-8 days. I leave it on when I shower, swim, workout, sleep, everything. And when I do take it off, I take it off for an hour to charge and then we are good to go!  Great for exactly what I need it to do. Only annoying thing is that when you get a text it notifies you of every single text that is unread on your phone. Really love the simplicity of this. Great buy.

  This turned out to be a great watch for a 12 year old boy. The band is a little big but not bad.He started running this year & loves having data for this distance, routes, & pace. We needed a watch with standalone GPS that could connect to the computer instead of a cell phone. The Garmin Forerunner 35 works perfectly! He’s used it daily, as a wristwatch & for recording exercise, for four months now without any problems.

  I think this watch is clunky and unattractive.  Having said that, I can't stop wearing it.  I love running with it...keeping an eye on my heart rate, clocking my laps and pace on runs, and seeing notifications and texts that come in on my smartphone.  I rely on this watch so much that I can't stop wearing it.  I know the more expensive model looks neater, but I just couldn't justify spending more.  It runs out of juice in 4-5 days, depending on data usage.  I'm confident it will work just fine for a whole marathon, since I just ran 16 miles with it and it only went down two bars after I completed the run.  I take it off at night, though, since I get a pinkened area on the skin underneath the pulse detector if I wear it constantly.

  I am an 81 year old walker with a pacemaker. Before the watch, I could only guess my milage by checking my route on google maps, solved. My concern for my heart rate is obvious but since I covered my distances without laboring I was confident I was well under my max rate. At first my rate seemed abnormally high so checking the manual pdf I found the watch was too low on my wrist. After moving it two fingers from the wrist bone then everything then became normal. The only thing I didn't care for or want was my sleep results. I changed my sleep time to zero and it disappeared, great! Overall now after a weeks use I know my route distances and I can the mix them up to provide some variety and enable me to meet my goals and advance my pace and distances without fear.

But it’s also great for people like me, who just want the basics and don’t want to get bogged down by a million features. I use it primarily for running, but I do use it for cross training (a lot of biking) as well. It can be a little inaccurate sometimes, generally anywhere from .02 to .10 off for running (indoor and outdoor). I compared it to other Garmins that my friends wear and theirs were the same. My only complaint is it doesn’t track mileage for outdoor biking; I probably need an accessory for it. We’ll see how I like it when I start training for a tri. Overall, I like it and I’m glad I bought it. I would definitely recommend this watch.

  I bought my Garmin 35 in December 2017, and I LOVED it. It tracked my runs and allowed me to control spotify without pulling out my phone mid-run. I loved the text alerts since I have a tendency to lose my phone in my backpack -- people could actually reach me! I didn't mind the look; kind of reminded me of the old calculator watches. But then things started going wrong. The eyelets on the band started breaking, so I had to wear the watch looser and looser. The watch would suddenly drop the connection to my phone and be unable to get it back for months, then suddenly be connected again. The sounds would stay on even if I manually turned them off. And finally, yesterday, it up and died mid-swim, even though it's water resistant to 50m. Now I'm stuck trying to find another brand or model, hopefully one that will last longer than a year and a half before becoming e-waste.

    Completely Inadequate for HR monitoring with compatible chest strap
  
",1.0,CLR,"Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought the Garmin chest strap to monitor my HR while road biking and linked it to my 810 Garmin GPS unit. I also bought the Forerunner watch to monitor my HR while engaging in other sports in and out of the gym.  What a disaster !  The HR on the watch has a huge lag and you only see the display when you push a button with your opposite hand. This means that you can never properly measure your ""peak"" rate in real time as by the time it shows up on the watch display, your heart is  already in recovery mode !  It's also clunky.  But I don't care about the esthetics, just wanted a reliable HR monitor/display like I had with my Timex Triathlon watch & chestband. Unfortunately Timex stopped manufacturing this watch. I regret having given mine to my daughter so I could have sent this Garmin back for a refund.

But it is a computer so expect a few computer glitches every now and then.  Had to do a restart once as it froze up during recharging.  Also could not load the garmin connect app on my computer when I first tried. But as usual just ""you tube"" the problem and you can always find the fixes.

  I have given this watch a five star review because this is an excellent fitness watch. It looks sleek and sporty(I chose the wild lime green, and wear it day and night) and does exactly what I need it to do - accurate heart rate, distance on runs or bike rides, speed, calories burned, etc. It's very easy to use but still has lots of great features.  Today while driving the screen suddenly went blank. When I got home and tried to charge it, nothing. I followed online directions for soft and hard reset - nothing. I contacted Garmin and immediately the customer service rep was able to diagnose a ""display hardware failure."" I have had the watch for 16 months, 4 months past the 1-year warranty. Thankfully Garmin replaced the watch but unfortunately they charged me $79. While I appreciate being given a significant discount, my previous Garmin Forerunner lasted 7 years and still works. While technically Garmin is certainly within their rights to not even give me anything at all, as a customer having an expensive product like this only last for 16 months (and then paying anything at all for its replacement or repair) doesn't build brand loyalty. I like it so much I paid for the new one but I'm disappointed that was the offer from the company. I would have liked the product to have either been repaired or replaced at no cost, a recognition from the company that it should still work less than a year and a half.

  *** UPDATE REVIEW ***4 months later.My original review was inaccurate as I jumped to conclusions saying the watch face was cracked but forgotten I had put a glass screen protector on and it was the protector that was cracked, not the watch face. SO if you buy this watch spend the extra $7 and get a screen protector. Its a lot cheaper to replace them than the watch face.*** Original review ***I've had this watch for exactly 66 days and the glass display screen broke. Worn it non-stop and only taken off to recharge. I would highly recommend getting the protection plan. Since Amazon will only accept returns up to 30 days after purchase it looks like I will need to pay to have Garmin customer service repair.Other then that it's a great watch. I believe it tracks everything fairly accurate. The GPS is spot on, along with the heart rate monitor. I would reccomend this watch to anyone who is beginning running or biking.

  This unit replaced my 1st gen Apple watch (which I gave to my spouse who's more into sports). A few things not covered by other reviewers:- The glass is anything but oleophobic. As a matter of fact, even cheapest glass on regular watches collect less fingerprints than this one. This glass specimen is so bad that it's hard to see through at times.- HR error filtering is noticeably worse than 1st gen Apple watch. You can wear Apple watch somewhat loosely around your wrist and still get accurate HR readings. With Garmin, you have to wear it tight, or your readings will be all over the place.- To see any non-rt data, you have to run the app on your phone.- There's no way to use this watch as a standalone navigation device, as it does not display your coordinates.- Backlight has 2 settings: ""Off"" and ""Nukelar"". You can use it as a flashlight at night.- Contrary to some reviews, the display is not e-ink or ""like e-ink"". It's an old fashioned LCD.Personally, I returned mine and for $60 extra got an Apple Watch 3. No regrets.

  Things were going well for the first 3 1/2 months then the face of the watch detached today at the driving range.  I liked the information this watch provided, especially when synched with the Garmin Connect app.  Unfortunately I previously had a Fitbit HR and went through three in about 18 months (all repaired and finally reimbursed under warranty) and now the product I replaced the Fitbit with just fell apart.  Not sure the two products I bought are robust enough to withstand much more than walking, running and cycling.  This product came apart under the shock of hitting golf balls.  I never buy warranties, but luckily I  purchased one for the Garmin.  It probably is still covered under the manufacturer's warranty.  Will call them tomorrow and let you know how they handle this.Just a follow-up to what I wrote above.  I had to report the damaged tracker via e-mail.  The next day I was contacted via e-mail by a Garmin representative asking for a photo of the damage.  I attached the same picture used here.  I was then given instructions to mail it back (at my cost) which I did on the 31st of October.  They did keep me appraised of the progress and on November 10th, I did receive a completely new watch in the mail, complete with a new charge cord (they told me to return only the watch so now I have two cords).  So in regards to fixing/replacing a broken tracker, as I am now wearing my fifth in about 22 months, Fitbit who shipped a new unit even before they received the old one back (at their cost) and provided phone support has Garmin beat.Other thoughts about this tracker that beat my old tracker(s) is the length of time between having to charge it and its waterproof characteristics.  I doubt it is rated for it, but I forgot to remove it this week while diving in Belize, and did a 90 foot dive and the watch appears fine.

  I initially liked the watch. It's great to head out without needing my phone for tracking. It tracks my route well, and is comfortable on my small 6"" wrist. The problem I have is that when I get home the auto sync with my phone almost never happens and I often have to uninstall and reinstall the app on my phone. I also at one point had to allow complete control of my phone system before it would sync. Then I had to go into the permissions to turn off access to all my other apps. Too much effort involved. It's sitting in a drawer and I am back to using my Fitbit Versa Lite

This Garmin is keeping my step count perfectly.  I would walk 3.5 miles with the others and get credit for 2 miles.  Drove me crazy.  This thing has been giving me full credit for a 1.25 mile walk in my building back and forth in a long hallway.  I do that 3 times a day and it is working perfectly.  It givems me credit for all my steps.  I know how many steps and count my laps.  I am so happy with this right now.  So far every walk has been close if not exact.

  I tried two other devices, the yamay smart match and the Fitbit versa 2. As an avid runner (logged 70 miles a week for years and now about 25-30) neither was accurate for mileage on the road or on the treadmill. I nearly lost faith when I finally purchased a Garmin 35. The watch is very very close to being perfect for distance calculations, steps, and metrics monitoring such as heart rates. For a runner there are a number of different data tables that will help you get back into it if you fall behind on activity or diet. This is a great watch for a great price and I would buy three more if I could. Highly recommend.

  I've had this for 2 weeks.  It has a lot of nice features, is easy to set up and use, and is comfortable.  The battery life on mine while using it almost daily for gps tracking for running/walking is at least a week which is great, and it charges pretty fast.  The app itself provides a ton of information for heart rate, sleep, gps, altitude, speed, etc.  I do find the gps to be slightly off, but it's not enough for me to really care about.

  I have had this watch for about 2 years now, very durable and works as advertised. The only downside id say is I dont think step counter is entirely accurate. I have walked on treadmills with it and it doesn't always seem to accumulate steps, I can go 1 mile on a treadmill and it will sometimes only add 300-400 steps to my daily total. A mile should generally be around 2000 steps. It seems good for regular walking or running.  The GPS function is pretty accurate you can record an activity and then look at it later on the app or web page and it will show your route and give a few other basic metrics like speed, time etcAnother odd thing I have seen I have had the watch reset itself a few times and so all step counters and activity minutes for the day are lost.I have worn the watch in the ocean, swimming pools, showers and saunas and it  held up well. The battery life is pretty good too with minimal GPS usage would last about 7 days.  I have needed to contact Garmin twice for small issues and their support is excellent. I just ordered a 645 Music and will be trading in this watch to Garmin

  As a heart monitoring device during exercise, this watch is useless.  Heart rate readings are very erratic, actually showing a declining heart rate while activity increases and continuing to show HR decline even after 3-4 minutes of running hard.  Garmin sent a replacement watch but it refuses to refund money because watch was purchased through Amazon and Amazon’s return policy is 30 days, if purchased direct from Garmin the refund policy is 1 year.

  For reference, I run 50-60 miles per week - I train and race with this watch, and have owned it for over a month.**Bottom line: I think this is plenty of watch for training and racing, and I don't think the extra features in the 235 are worth the price difference. I would buy this again based on my experience so far.**I was reluctant to make this purchase because I have previously only used 'dumb' watches to track my total time and splits. This was the cheapest option I could find that had the features I thought I needed.Things I like:-On roads, the distance is close enough to be useful.-The pace *usually* adjusts fairly quickly.-Battery life has never been an issue, but I charge it about an hour every 2-3 days.-You're able to adjust/semi-customize (up to 5 via the iPhone app) screens of data. Through the app, this is fairly quick so it's something you can adjust before a workout or race if you find that necessary.-The heart rate monitor seems reasonably accurate (note: I had to update the firmware on the watch and soft reset the watch before this was the case).-I like the data the iPhone app captures that I can review later.Things I don't like:-In the woods or anywhere with quick turns, switchbacks, etc. this thing is totally worthless for distance/pace. I can't speak to it with the same authority, but I'm guessing it's a similar issues in cities with tall buildings. For me in wooded trails, it misses roughly 1 mile per 6 miles.-When I said pace *usually* adjusts quickly, there are exceptions to that. Sometimes, somewhat unexpectedly, pace doesn't instantly jump - it changes slowly and keeps ramping up after you've already backed off. Separately, almost always if you change directions (i.e. a turnaround or sharp turn), the pace goes bonkers thinking you slowed way down as you retrace your steps.-There is no 'second' reading on the standard digital 'time of day' clock face (or I haven't figured out how to get it to show up yet). I didn't realize how much I use that in daily life until it was missing.-I haven't figured out how to access other watch features while in the middle of a workout (i.e. you have to end the run to back out of the run screen).Things I thought I would like that I haven't used at all:-I thought I would like the feature where you can build custom workouts and then the watch will keep track of your splits based on that workout template. It proved to take too much time to set up so I find myself saying ""that is cool"" but not doing it.Surprise feature:-I think this technically isn't on a list of compatible devices for the sleep feature, and it doesn't seem to track REM sleep. However, it does track 'light' and 'deep' as well as movement and total sleep time. I didn't expect to use it at all, but I find myself looking at this every morning.

    is a really nice feature. It's quicker to set an alarm
  
",5.0,Felicia Harrsch,"Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2018","









  
  
    
  I had a Fitbit Charge HR for two years, actually two of them because the first one fell apart and so did the second one, so I was looking for something that was more durable (and staying away from Fitbit due to their tendency to fall apart). After scouring the internet and reading many reviews, I decided to try the Garmin Forerunner 35. As I've only had it for a week, I cannot speak to its long-term durability, but I've outlined comparisons of many features of the forerunner to the charge hr.Comfort: The Fitbit was cumbersome and often times uncomfortable, especially under long sleeves. I was surprised at how soft and supple the band of the forerunner was and how I nearly forgot I was wearing it.Bluetooth connection: I've found that the bluetooth connection for the forerunner is stronger than the charge hr. It syncs way faster than the fitbit.Alarm: being able to set the alarm right on the forerunner, as opposed to using the app to set the alarm and than sync it for the charge hr, is a really nice feature. It's quicker to set an alarm.GPS: I really love this feature on the forerunner. I have found that it is pretty accurate and it doesn't take too long to locate the GPS. Charge hr doesn't have this feature, which I found frustrating (especially considering similar price points), when I'm trying to gauge an accurate distance for running. I've gone on three runs since I got the forerunner less than a week ago and I feel as though it is accurate in regards to this.Battery life: the Charge HR lasted on average 3 days until it needed to be charged. I got the forerunner last Saturday, only charged it to three bars (out of four), and it is now Friday (6 days later) and I've used the GPS 5 times for short 15-50 minute intervals, and the forerunner still has 2 bars of battery life. This feature is so amazing. I hated having to charge the fitbit so often.Garmin connect vs. Fitbit app: I feel like the garmin app has so many more features than Fitbit.Overall: I am super impressed with the forerunner 35. It seems superior to fitbit charge hr, especially since it is in a similar price point range. The forerunner 35 is perfect for a person who casually runs and wants other fitness data. A more avid runner may want some more features to better track their runner. But forerunner does the job for me (run roughly 2 to 3 times per week and work out 3 to 4 times per week). I haven't checked the waterproofness of the forerunner, but one of my runs was in the rain and it held up great.

  Pretty nice watch overall for the price.  Run and bike tracking works just fine.

According to this thing, I haven't had more than 5 hours sleep in months.Nice that you can have an analog face with the date showing.  Excellent battery life (6 days or so without using GPS).  Having phone notifications is a plus, too.Minor beef:  watch band de-glued from watch after just a couple months.  While Garmin replaced it for free, the replacement took 10 days to get here.  I bought a compatible watch band in the interim (they were able to ship overnight), and I like the aftermarket one better anyway.

    Great activity tracker, average smartwatch
  
",4.0,Michael Case,"Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2016","









  
  
    
  A couple months back, after more than 8 years of service, my trusty Garmin Forerunner 60 bit the dust.  In need of a new watch to help record my workouts, I surveyed the field of new fitness watches and activity trackers and settled on a Pebble2 +HR.  I loved the relatively sleek design of the Pebble and the customizable watch faces, but the companion app lacked a lot of basic features and less than two weeks after receiving mine, Pebble announced their acquisition by FitBit along with a statement indicating they could not promise the watch would remain functional in the future.  So, back went the Pebble, and I ordered up this Garmin Forerunner 35 (FR35) as a replacement.  After living with it for about a month, here's how it stacks up.HARDWAREOverall the hardware is acceptable, although far from stylish.  I do have a couple of quibbles though.  The ""Analog"" face, isn't completely terrible, but the ""Digital"" face is ugly.  The digital time readout is legible, but the giant Bluetooth connection indicator and battery status stick out like a sore thumb.  My Pebble offered a much more elegant face (along with dozens of other options) that was able to show a digital time display along with the current weather, current HR, and current step total.  It would be nice to see something more along those lines offered here.  Another minor complaint is with the wrist strap.  While plenty comfortable for 24/7 wear, the diagonal line texture seems to trap chlorine and soap residue and requires a thorough scrubbing every few days.  I'm also disappointed to see that it's connected to the watch via two star-head screws.  When the strap inevitably fails, I'll have to hope Garmin has replacements available.  A standard watch strap would have been much preferred here.WORKOUTSI have had the chance to try the FR35 out across a varied set of workouts including swims, indoor treadmill runs, and outdoor runs.  When outdoors the GPS tracking is as accurate as my phone's GPS.  I compared measured workout distances between the FR35 and MapMyRun and found the total distance measured to be extremely close.  The heart rate accuracy provided by the wrist strap is good, much better than what I saw on the Pebble, but it's slower to react to changes than the Wahoo chest strap I compared it against.  Given an additional 5-10 seconds to respond to a change in effort, it seemed to +/- 5bpm compared to the chest strap about 95% of the time.  If that error bothers you, you can pair it with an ANT+ chest strap during workouts instead (like the Wahoo Tickr or any recent Garmin strap).ACTIVITY TRACKINGThe FR35 seems to count steps fairly accurately.  It does a pretty good job of rejecting random arm movements that otherwise inflate step counts.  While I generally find the distance calculation based on pedometer step counts to be laughably inaccurate, I was reasonably impressed at how close the total calculated distance to the actual distance on a treadmill run.  While I wouldn't necessarily rely on this to measure out mile splits, it's close enough for casual distance guesstimation.The sleep tracking works quite well and is automatic.  I find it logs my actual sleep and wake times within about +/- 10 minutes of when I actually fall asleep and it does a good job of rejecting time spent reading in bed.  The sleep tracking graphs breakdown sleep into light and deep sleep periods (although, without knowing how these periods are calculated it's hard to read too much into these) as well as movement levels.  I'll be very interested to monitor my sleep levels over time (hours and quality) to see how my general feeling of wellness changes as the amount of quality sleep time I'm getting varies.It's hard to comment on the accuracy of calorie tracking without access to a physiology lab.  The calories burned are tracked, and it's kind of useful to look at the trend over time.  I wouldn't rely on the number of calories burned as reported by the watch to be super accurate though (if, say you're monitoring caloric input/output).NOTIFICATIONSWhen connected with my phone, the notifications are usable.  Text messages and phone calls (and other notifications if I desire) buzz through to the watch face.  It's enough to know there's something that may require my attention and a glance at the screen provides enough of a summary to decide if I need to pull out my phone or deal with the notification later.  While I have found getting these alerts on my wrist pretty useful, this particular feature falls short of what the Pebble offered.  There's no queue or timeline for reviewing notifications as there is on the Pebble and I find I miss the ability to simply scroll back through previous alerts.BATTERY LIFEThe Forerunner 35's battery life is outstanding.  I get between 8 and 10 days between charges, and a full charge takes only a few hours.  This is much better than I expected and ensures I only miss a few hours of activity monitoring per month.  Given the time of year, I've been doing most of my running indoors so I've made light use of the GPS, I expect as the weather warms up and I do more outside running with the GPS on, I'll lose a couple of days of battery life, but I expect I should still make it a week or so between charges.APP/WEBSITEI've used Garmin's connect website to log my swims and runs for years now, so most of the experience there is familiar.  The website provides access to my workout history so I can compare runs and swims against previous efforts and see improvements over time.  Now that I have the FR35, I get access to my sleep, all-day heart rate, and activity tracking data there as well.  The app for my Android phone is decent.  It can be a little confusing navigating through the various screens, but overall, all of the information I would care to look at is available, often presented in easy to digest charts and graphs.FINAL THOUGHTSOverall I find the FR35 to be an excellent activity tracker and workout companion, but only a mediocre smartwatch.  A few tweaks to the software allowing for some nicer watch face options and a better interface for dealing with notifications would make this a five-star device.  Still, even with these shortcomings, I find myself wearing it 24/7 and imagine it will be on my wrist for a few years reliably logging my activity until my next upgrade.

  I have had this watch for quite a while now and really love it.  It is my first smartwatch and I did a lot of research before I bought it.  I like that it is very flat against my wrist and has a very comfortable wristband with a standard watch closure that should fit any wrist.  I have small wrists so this was really important to me.  The display is great and easy to use.  I tend to use the run tracker - and combined with Strava I get a map of my daily run which I like.  The heart rate sensor works well and I love getting this data.  Sleep tracking is great too.  I like that I can change my music with it - which was an important feature.  The one kind of quirky this is that it loses the connection to my phone from time to time.  I turn off the watch to reset it and that seems to help.  Not sure it is is a watch problem or a phone problem.  I got a white band and it has cleaned up easily so far no matter what I have gotten on it.  I am pleased with the price and quality of this watch - and how easy it is to use once you get the hang of it.  I did get a 3rd party screen cover that works great.

  This is my third Garmin watch and I must say the technology has improved over the years.  My previous, still working, 230 does not have the features this watch offers and is a little more cumbersome to use.  The Bluetooth connectivity makes the setup of this watch super easy and the posted reviews are correct about satellite connectivity.  It is basically immediate once outside and I don't seem to lose connectivity as I sometimes did with the older watch.  The square face is something new and different and I do like the analog watch feature.  I would recommend this product without reservations.Update 4/15/17:  I am now reducing the number of stars to 31/2 for this watch.  The heart rate monitor is not so great. It constantly reads low heart rate during my runs and the vibration to alert me is very annoying.  I have been unable to determine any adjustment to make this go away.  I don't think it's capturing my pulse rate even though I have it positioned in the recommended location.  I have gone back to my 230 model for now....

  Love this fitness watch!!  It gives you your time, distance and pace even if your running indoors and if you do cardio it keeps track of your heart rate.  It will give you notifications and tell you who is calling if your phone rings and it automatically updates itself.  It gives you a calendar and keeps all your workout history.  I started to buy another Timex because that is what I had before, but this watch is MORE THAN WORTH THE EXTRA MONEY!!!

  Have not even had this watch one month and am already having significant issues. Screens froze twice while out for my run and the device did not sync.  Tried soft reset - no improvement.  Tried hard reset - now I have nothing but a blank screen.  Went to the Garmin website to try and troubleshoot hoping to find a live chat option.  Couldn't find one.  Spending a Saturday trying to figure out how to fix this lemon.  If any other users had similar issues and were able to get them resolved would appreciate some guidance.

  This is my 4th Garmin watch and I love it. It is stylish and works very well and accurately. I don't do heavy workouts like I did years ago and needed something for everyday simple workouts and step counting. This is perfect! If you are a serious athlete and want all the bells and whistles for tracking your workouts with splits and whatnot, I would recommend another watch. But if you're like me now, older with some arthritis and aches as residuals from my youthful days, then this watch would be perfect for you. It has an actual GPS tracking so when you're outdoors for your exercises you can track your actual distance, time and cardiac pace. It has a mode that when your at the gym and can't use the GPS, you can still track what you are doing on the treadmill, bike, elliptical or whatever. It is waterproof, but I don't wear it for swimming as it doesn't count laps like my Garmin Swim watch does, but I could wear it in the water and not be afraid of damage. I highly recommend as an alternative to some of the other ""Fitness Trackers"" out there these days.

  Let me start with what Iove. This has a monochrome non-touch screen. Why do I love this? The low power draw allows the time to always be displayed like a normal watch. I hate how you have to flip your arm to get a normal smart watch to display. I leave the bluetooth off and the battery lasts even longer. I have not done a test to see how many days this lasts as a watch, but it is a long time.I bought this to replace my Garmin 305. This will pair with the Garmin chest strap. However, I have found the wrist based heart rate to be accurate enough for my purposes.There are a couple of things that I find really frustrating. I like that the screen is not touch screen in that I suspect the use of side buttons over a touch screen must save battery life. However, I hate that the menus can only be scrolled through one direction due to one button being dedicated to the strolling. Perhaps another button on the right side in the next version would solve the problem: Up, down, and select.It bugs me that the countdown timer only goes with 5 minute increments.

  This baby has a very soft band that is so comfortable. I no longer have to run with my phone to keep track of my pace or distance and it never takes more than 90seconds to find my GPS location wherever I may be. There are a few handy in run features like virtual pacer and lap tracking which are useful for me. And with heart rate monitoring it calculates your VO2 max.Doesn't do a good job with sleep tracking as a fitbit Alta HR because it doesn't give REM sleep and sometimes the awake time is off but not bad overall and not the primary reason I bought it.

  It was great while it worked....which was about 2 months. I initially purchased to use on runs. However, after a couple months the heart rate monitor is completely inaccurate (initially it was very accurate). During runs it seriously underestimates my heart rate to the point it is comical (which sucks, bc I base my pace on my heart rate), or it takes several minutes after I stop running for the heart rate monitor to catch up and give me the somewhat correct feedback. It tracks distance ok, and can be set for intervals.

  I bought this to track my runs way back in 2017. 2 1/2 years later I thought I’d finally give my review. I would give it 5 stars, but the wrist based heart monitor is pretty worthless. It keeps track of my distances well. It has proven reliable in picking up a satellite signal. It has resisted water.

  It's not for high level training as it's a fairly simple fitness tracker, but it has more features than comparable Fitbits in the same price range, namely built in GPS. This is the least expensive watch I've found from an established brand that has built in GPS, which similar Fitbits don't offer, meaning you don't have to carry your phone around while you're exercising for tracking, which is vital for us Strava users. I wouldn't even consider a watch without GPS- when I walk/run, it shows pace, distance, and time, and when I cycle it shows speed, distance, and time, and I can track my routes as well. The one issue I have had with it is the buttons are directly across from each other, meaning sometimes when I try to press one button, I accidentally press the button on the opposite side, but with practice I am getting better at operating it. But that's a very minor issue, because overall I like it very much. There is a reason so many websites have awarded this the best value fitness tracker.

I bought it for running.Four easy-to-see buttons control everything, and in an intuitive manner. I bought this as a running watch, but I'm wearing it constantly. The sleep info seems a bit wonky, but since that's a bonus feature, I still have room to be pleasantly surprised. It paired easily with my Android-powered watch and it's smart-watch functionality is impressive, with the info delivered in an efficient manner.In summation, using this watch is easy and the information is useful. At the current price point, this is a steal. But if you want a flashy Garmin watch, you're going to have to go up-level.

  I've had Garmin 210 and 310 monitors before and they were pretty good. This one is a total fail in my opinion. First and foremost it simply won't accurately measure pulse. I can count my pulse at 160 and the watch will report anything from 98 to 134 or so. Same throughout the aerobic and anaerobic ranges. That makes the watch useless to me. On top of that, it just doesn't provide anything really useful other than average heart rate (not your high and low in real time during a workout). Gonna have to return it and go back to my dependable, clunky timex.

  UPDATE: My first watch had to be replaced, conveniently just after the 30-day return window closed. I've had the replacement for less than 4 weeks, and with this one, it sporadically stops recording data. A long chat session with Garmin support revealed that 1) There is a latency delay with their servers but some of the data will probably show up eventually, and 2) The watch stopped recording at 4am and they don't know why. According to them, it shouldn't happen again. I'm not convinced.I don't need all the bells and whistles that come with this watch. The pacing function is pretty useless with limited configurability. But I paid a premium to get a good GPS watch that syncs with MapMyRun and MyFitnessPal so that I can track my various routes and maintain data over time. For that, it works well WHEN it works.But now I'm stuck with a watch that only works when it feels like it.==========ORIGINAL REVIEW===========I like it just fine.... but it stopped working after 5 weeks (just past the 30-day return window). Problem: could no longer connect to charge. Connection wasn't connecting. After long chat and troubleshooting with support, they offered to exchange it for a working model....Other quibbles: Steps are way way off. I calibrated my steps and double checked several times, but before I even get out of bed in the morning it will say I've done over 1000 steps....which suggests it's not the step calibration that's off, but something wrong with the device itself. Also, it only integrates with myfitnesspal, which sucks if you have an extensive record on some other platform (and have prepaid a year's membership).Although Garmin is replacing the device, the experience has been so poor that I would prefer to have gotten a refund so that I could buy another brand of watch.

  I did quite a bit of research when deciding which activity-based watch to buy. I run about 20-25 miles per week and wanted something that could boost my training stats beyond what I can receive exclusively for an app. The Garman Forerunner 35 seemed like a perfect fit and a justifiable price. I can verify this is true! I've had mine for a week and have used it to track about 5 different activities. The battery life is still half full. The app needed to go along with this watch is also incredibly useful. It works in conjunction with my Strava and Myfitnesspal apps to keep my training and diet on track. It helps to monitor my sleep, count my steps, and track my heart rate. I'm not sure how well it will do in water because I'm afraid to try it, just in case, but this watch is everything I was hoping it would be! I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a good quality, first-time training watch.

  I am a long time runner - however I don't like watches with tons of bells and whistles - I want fast GPS signal, accurate mileage, speed etc...the Forerunner 35 has it all - have used it for a week now and LOVE IT! Accurate and super fast GPS signal (I live in NYC so sometimes GPS can take a few mins due to buildings BUT not with this watch).This watch DOES have a lot of nice extras like sleep, heart monitor, steps etc...if you want those features - for the price this is EXCELLENT value - also for those of us with smaller wrists, it is NOT clunky - super light and syncs like a dream.I used to own Polar's but their USB breaks after a week, they never sync easily, their alerts are horrible etc...will never buy again. Polar is a ripoff who can't catch up with the times...

  I've originally bought this watch only to track my workouts, mainly interested in GPS part for running/biking. This is my first tracker of this type, so I don't have much to compare to.For the price, this ended up being a great tool:- GPS is super helpful, nice to have the map of your work-out and a bunch of associated stats;- The interface is simple and easy to use;- Waterproof feature works- Battery lasts a good amount of time (usually a week or a bit under, depending on type of use, especially GPS) and recharges quickly, I've ended up using this as a watch (for time...), which I wasn't planning on originally- Heartrate, as long as there's understanding that this type of measurement isn't super accurate, it is still great to have for comparative purposes. I haven't tried adding on chest meter or anything.- Running inside / steps - not sure how accurate these are, lately for treadmill running I've been getting shorter distance estimate than what treadmill is showing.- App is pretty good and has decent stats for running, riding and general existingOne gripe I have is that the watch isn't able to receive texts, weather, etc from my phone for some reason. I've re-uploaded the app and still have issue here...Overall, this is a great fitness watch. Would buy again (but hopefully not too soon)

  The watch is a typical Garmin product, functional with poor aesthetics. One thing that bothers me is the gap between the edges and screen. Dirt , sea salt gathers in there. I don't know what is the screen material but its impossible to keep it clean. The strap also catches lint. The HR sensor shows about 5 to 10 beats lower.

  Ok so I had an older Garmin before treating myself to this upgrade. The older one wasn’t the best for keeping track of your pace accurately but at least it kept track of my heart rate accurately. This new Garmin sucks!!!!!! If I could give it less than 0 stars I would! The heart rate monitor is 100% off! I know this because I’ve been on machines that keep track of it as well and the machine will say my heart rate is 165, which I know to be true because I’ll be dying and this Garmin says my heart rate is 50! It’s extremely frustrating when you’re trying to keep track of your progress and calories burned and your stupid watch basically says you’re being a lazy couch potato when in reality your sweating your ‘balls’ off! I don’t recommend this product if you’re an active person who is looking to keep track of your heart rate accurately!

  This is a great fitness watch and I wear it all day long as well. The battery life is good and it's clear when it's time to charge it up. It's waterproof so I never have to worry about exercising in the rain. It is irritating that the watch will randomly update and I have to plug it into my computer to get the home screen back. I also find that the step counter is wildly off when I go hiking and don't have it in activity mode. I did a 7 mile hike with some friends and my watch told me I had only walked 3 - 4 miles worth of steps. If you want to focus on step counting, this is not the watch for you.

  I just started running a lot more and have joined a couple running groups. I soon realized that I really needed my own running watch to help track my pace, distance, time, etc, but I also didn't want to spend $500+ for all the bells and whistles. I've been completely satisfied with the Garmin Forerunner 35. It's comfortable to wear, easily connects to the Garmin Connect app on my smart phone, and provides more than enough data to track my workouts and progress. At around $120 it's still not exactly cheap, but it's not bad at all for everything you get. It doesn't have a touch screen and maybe isn't as sleek as the pricier watches, but it does everything I want it to. I don't really use it for tracking my sleep or other daily habits, so I can't comment about that, but I imagine it does a great job with those tasks too.

  I originally bought this watch in January 2018. I primarily used it for running, especially for mid to long distance outdoor and indoor running and as an everday use watch for work (I work in the hospital setting). I loved the simplicity of this watch and the ease of cleaning the watch after every day use. I recently wore this watch on a river float and it was only submerged intermittently in less than 2ft of water. After I noticed the screen was shorting out and there was condensation inside the watch. I'm very disappointed that this watch failed after less than 2 years of use and that the guaranteed water resistance was not true. Due to the fact that the watch is more than a year old, I am not eligible for any refund or replacement, which is disappointing that a watch this expensive is only good for less than 2 years.

  I really liked the watch. It was easy to use and had everything one would expect from a running watch--time, distance, speed, calories burned, heart rate, etc. The problem is the heart rate monitor does not function properly. It's sporadic, and oftentimes will not pick up your heart rate. I had to shut the watch off a few times just to get it to reset. I returned one watch because of this problem and got another. But I had the same problem with the second watch too, so if someone is looking for a reliable heart rate monitor, I would not recommend this watch. Everything else, however, functioned properly.

  First of all I had an issue with being sent a garmin forerunner 35 without a charger AND it wouldnt turn on even after I got a replacement charger. Amazon was great and sent me a replacement charger. I then returned that garmin and got a replacement 35.Pros:-GPS picks up fast,-mileage for runs seems accurate outdoors (indoors isn't as accurate as just watching the treadmill)-good basic interface + optionscons:-no music from 35 (knew that going into it)-wrist heart rate measurements are SLOW to update (i was wearing a chest strap and the 35) chest strap showed 170+ while the watch still had me in the 90's on a 80-90% effort run. Eventually it caught up but if quick heart rate measurements are important to you I suggest you grab a chest HRM.If you need a no frills watch that gives you a few text messages via bluetooth and use it for pacing+ intervals it does a decent enough job at it. It is very convenient to run a workout with the watch for pacing vs carrying my smartphone on the run.I'm happy with my purchase and amazon's support.

  This is not high on UX. I had to look up the manual on their website and even that didn't help a lot. I've kinda stumbled my way into figuring it out but not totally. All I want to know is my heart rate (zones) while running. I don't wear this all day, just when I run. I bought a chest strap monitor as well to pair for greater accuracy. The watch recognises the chest monitor but then when I click on Outdoor Exercise, it says ""Wait"" and then stays on that for 25 minutes (I've lost any interest in the watch at that point). I can't get the heart rate screen to stay on. So it's more of a distraction than asset to my workout. I should just return the darn thing since I can't use it.

  I have been using this watch for a few weeks now and am very pleased with it.  I wanted this watch primarily for the GPS function while running, and I have been pleasantly surprised by the consistency with which it reports my mileage.  I walked the same route on three consecutive days to see if the watch reported the same distance, and the watch indicated I had reached the one mile mark within ten or so yards each day.  When I finish a run or a walk and sync my watch with my phone, I'm able to view my route on my phone, along with my pace and a color-coded indicator of the faster and slower portions of my run.I also bought one for my dad, who enjoys tech-y things (and to encourage him to stay active in his retirement).  I have the teal band and I bought my father the watch with the black band.  The band is comfortable, although it is sometimes challenging to fasten and unfasten it - I guess the idea is that Garmin wants you to keep it on :)  But I have not used the watch for sleep tracking because I don't want to wear a watch while I'm sleeping.

  I have been using the Forerunner since January and love it.pros:Fast tracking. It doesnt take more than a minute usually to grab a satellite, of all my hiking data it has only incorrectly tracked once and quickly corrected.Battery is fantastic, lasts for days even with 1 bar.Very minimalist. Not frills with this watch that can distract you like an Apple Watch.Cons:Its not that pretty. I know thats a low hanging fruit but its a little bulky and just overall doesnt look great.Not enough default activities. No hiking or swimming options, this can be corrected using the site and changing the activity type.HR. This is a little tough, it can be sensitive, hanging your hand out your car window, lawn mowers and bikes can all raise your HR with vibrations. When I go to the gym, it has trouble getting an accurate HR for a cardio workout when you hands are not by your side. This makes using a stair climber hard to track HR, sometimes there is a bit of a delay on the treadmill as well.Hand placement: As mentioned above, hand placement is key, pushing a lawn mower? Forget those steps! Using the stair climber, forget those steps as well!Overall I love it though. I can track trails using just my watch and don't need to pair it with bluetooth unlike other devices. The battery lasts forever. It provides an accurate pace while running (this takes some calibration at first with treadmills). For the price you really wont get better.

  The Garmin Forerunner 35 worked great for me (at first). I've had it for a month and loved everything about it until I started having an allergic reaction to the band. I've read that silicone allergies are really rare but I've tried the band on both wrists and it happened on both wrists. No new soaps, perfumes, or anything. I called Garmin and they were awesome working with me to find a different Garmin product that wouldn't have a silicone band. I'm sad to trade in the Garmin Forerunner 35 for a different one with a leather band but it's what was needed. Even though I'm not keeping the Forerunner 35, it was a great product and the company was wonderful to work with.

  Along with in built GPS and wrist based heart monitor, I bought this watch for its looks. I wanted it to be able to wear it in the office and dont look like its a sports watch. The GPS and heart based monitors are accurate as stated by many others. The reason I gave 3 stars and returned the watch is because of the time it took to start the GPS. For first 2 weeks, everything worked fine. Then, GPS started taking more than 5 minutes to turn on. I called Garmin support and they helped to reset the GPS. It worked fine for a couple of days and started being problematic again. It took more the 15 minutes to turn the GPS on once. Thanks to amazon's return policy, I was able to return it after a month.

  I’ve had this watch for a little over a year. In the past 3 months it frequently freezes up and becomes completely useless.  Usually this happens after my run when I switch over to the walking setting. Not only does it usually take 1-2 minutes to recapture the GPS signal, it often completely seizes up and won’t work at all.  Today I held my breath (as I do now whenever I try to use this watch) and turned it on to capture the GPS signal for my walk. Yay! It worked. 1 mile into my walk, it buzzed showing me I had completed my first interval. A lot of time passed and I realized that I should be hitting mile 2. I looked at my watch and found that it was not tracking. Nope. It turned the track feature off. I looked in the history and found that my last recorded activity was yesterday.  Great. Between the freezing up, the ransomware attack that made the app unusable and now knowing that if the watch feels like not tracking, it’ll just stop, I’m done.  I will be switching over to another GPS tracker. I’m tired of being infuriated and holding my breath that my watch is going to do what it’s supposed to do.

  Wanted something to track how many miles I walk at work and heart rate, this is perfect. I’ve tried so many Fitbits (don’t bother with them, they’re trash) and a few Jawbones as well, but the Garmin is the best one I’ve ever owned. I like that I can see notifications from my phone on the watch itself, but rarely ever turn it on. I thought about getting an Apple Watch to have everything this does, and more, but decided on the Garmin because it seems to stand the test of time. I did a lot of research before purchasing this and recommend that you do the same. It’s not touch screen, has buttons on both sides, and is a black and white screen rather than a colored one. Garmins are also supposed to be more accurate than Fitbits, etc. I had to buy some screen protectors for it, but this thing has managed to survive everything I put it through at work. I would definitely recommend it.UPDATE: May 2020I still own this watch and still love it! It has stood the test of time. I had a very physically demanding job when I bought this (lifting heavy items, constantly on my feet) and also would have to climb into and fix equipment. Proud to say this watch endured all of that for 2 plus years...and I’m pretty hard on it. Can’t recommend it enough!

  What I looked for from Forerunner 35 was long battery life (+ 10 hours GPS time), Bluetooth and reasonably fast GPS initiation. Forerunner 35 met all of these. I just had a 7.5 hour day hike the other day and the power indicator showed only 50% (2 of 4 bars remaining) power consumption. It most likely meets 12-hour GPS power supply Garmin's advertised. It is also easy to connect and upload data to Garmin Connect via Bluetooth from my phone, except that the upload time seems long (like 5 min?) for a 7.5 hour data.However my main complaints are the overall design of it: flimsy build, ugly fonts and formats of digital display, for example, the date Sunday 12/2/2018 would simply become ""Sun 2"". It looks to me Garmin wanted it out to market as soon as main features done, everything else just cheaply made to meet minimum standard. I want to give 3.5 stars but had to settle for 4.

The battery lasts several weeks even if I've used the GPS mode. I don't think that the step counter or calorie counter is very accurate. When I compare it to my iPhone the phone always has many more steps counted (assuming I've had them both on me for the time period that I'm comparing). The calorie counter also doesn't seem to be very accurate, specifically in the Cardio workout mode. I use this mainly for running and I do think the GPS function is fairly accurate so for my purposes it works okay, but if you're looking for a very accurate step/calorie counter you may want to consider one of the nicer versions.

  This is the best fitness watch for value I have had. It's nothing fancy like the smartwatches so there's no calling or messaging but you can have the watch show you who is calling and even answer it but the call is routed to your phone. For texts, it will show who is texting you (have to sync contacts) and what the message is which is great! However, allowing this will deplete the battery usually within two days I'm at half a battery with the smart notifications on (text and calls). Otherwise, the watch will last almost two weeks fully charged. This watch was intended for fitness focus but has some great smartwatch features. The GPS can be slow to sync up but usually it's at the most a mjnute. The application is fantastic and you can even join group challenges from people all over (such as who is waking the most, etc.).You can track the following activities:Walk (gps tracking)Run Outdoor ( GPS tracking)Run Indoor (stationary no gps tracking)BikeCardioFeatures:Analong or digital clock displayWeather and forcast with precip chance humidity and temperature.Heart rate with average resting and activeNotifications (smart from your phone so texts and missed calls and also any fitness goal stats)Step counter with distance counterCalories burned with resting and activeFitness activity log that shows your recent activities (tracked walks runs bike etc)Overall, I highly recommend you try out this watch when on sale!

  If you are looking to track heartrate, get something with a chest strap.  I knew it would not be as good as what you get with a chest strap, but at least thought it would be in the ballpark (like within 10 BPM). Sometimes  it is off by over 50 beats and it is not remotely consistent.  Sometimes it works almost as well as my watch with a strap, sometimes it is a little off and sometimes waaaay off so there is really no way to even calibrate it to yourself.

  I use this watch only for running. I run 3-5 miles a day, 5 days a week. This watch is easy to use and read.  My only complaint is that the calorie count seems totally random.  For instance, I ran 3.5 miles today, and the watch told me I'd burned 135 calories.  I slowly walked two miles the other day with my kids, and the watch told me I'd burned 270 calories. I ran a fast 5K, and the watch told me I'd burned 128 calories.  You get the picture.  I am more interested in mileage and time, and those features seem to work well.  But it would be nice if the calorie feature worked.

  It helps me a lot to manage my goals and not to get fooled by my feelings or impressions. When you start as runner sometimes at the middle of your training you could say to yourself: “oh that’s enough for today” but then you watch the distance you’ve achieved, watch your heart rate monitor and you can make some adjustments to your running to make it last a little bit more and work better.

  I only rate this watch as ok. It is great for tracking my heart rate with an attached chest strap, and the gps works well enough. The battery lasts about 5-7 days which is great. But the negative. The intensity minutes don't work at all. I can receive minutes for walking around in my kitchen, but HIT interval training for 45 minutes gives me no vigorous minutes counted. Also, it will not log any exercise minutes unless I have my heart rate over 85%. So no normal workouts get logged as intensity minutes. I contacted Garmin support, and they said this is normal. They were of no help. Also the resting heart rate figures are completely inaccurate.I recommends  this watch only for it's basic functions, gps, heart rate with strap, and steps.

  Since you can get these for around $100, they're a great GPS watch for the price. I'm old-school on GPS watches, being a (retired) excessive marathoner and trail runner. I've had Garmins since they first came out. I tended to use the bulkier but more accurate forerunners. I'm still on a 310xt for running use because it's more accurate than newer units and it includes bread-crumb mapping, which is key when you want to follow your patch back in unfamiliar territory (or pre-load a trail). This little unit doesn't do any of that, but it's still a great one because it's got much better visibility and it's a lot easier to use. If you just want to count steps, get some heart rate info, and log running or biking workouts -- plus get a text message or two, then this is an excellent GPS watch at that price point.

  I bought my first Forerunner 35 in January 2017 from Amazon. A few weeks after purchase, and after Amazon's return window had closed, I received a cryptic message on the watch: ""Setting time by GPS"", and then the watch simply stopped working. Garmin tech support concluded that the watch had failed a software upgrade, and sent me a new one. About 2 months after receiving my new watch, the watch face fell off. Garmin sent me a refurbished watch. It's now November, 2017. A few days ago I once again received that cryptic message, ""setting time by GPS"", followed by a diagnostics screen, and once again the watch simply stopped working. Tech support was friendly and helpful, but baffled, and strongly encouraged me to simply upgrade to a different Forerunner unit, specifically a Forerunner 235, at a 33% discount. Since the Forerunner 235 is a more expensive watch, the cost to me would still be $200, about what my original watch cost. I declined, so tech support agreed to send me, ""as a courtesy"", another refurbished Forerunner 35, but warned me that that was the last time Garmin would send me a replacement watch.I love most Garmin products, mainly GPS receivers, and had high hopes for this watch, but it keeps letting me down. I wonder if anyone else has had as many problems as me.

  This is a classic case of fool me once, shame on you...I own a Garmin Forerunner 25. It works, but it's flaky, so I decided to get a new watch. Plus I needed a watch that I could use for interval training. I read several good reviews of this watch, it had the features I needed for a good price, so I decided to give Garmin another shot.Apparently the reviewers got the watches that actually work.I plugged in the watch into a wall charger to charge it as soon as I got it. 18 hours later, nada. The watch wasn't charging and it wouldn't power on. Someone on a Garmin forum suggested plugging it into a laptop to get it going. This worked to get the watch to turn on and charge, but neither the Mac OS nor the Garmin Express software could find the watch. This meant I couldn't sync the watch or install the update.I couldn't tell you if it works well on runs since I couldn't get past the basics of charging/syncing/updating.I'm returning it today and I will never purchase a Garmin product ever again. What a hassle.

  Another good Garmin product, but with several issues:Issue #1 : Heart rate monitoring accuracy is unfortunately hit or Miss.  Running with my Forerunner 35 my heart rate is not accurate, it is usually 15-20 BPM low.  Compared to my Forerunner 25 with a Garmin chest strap my history on my regular 5-8 mile run is quite different.  On a Treadmill my Forerunner 25 + Chest Strap compares closely to a professional heart rate monitor with a cuff, the difference is nearly always less than 3 BPM, the model 35 difference is 8-15 BPM lower than the professional HRM.  I have also run wearing both the 25 (with Garmin chest strap) and the 35 on the same runs and have seen those same differences.Issue #2:  battery life is quite short, usually about 3 days with an hour run each day is about the limit before it’s recharge time. This is in sharp contrast to My Forerunner 25 which can easily go 8-10 days with a one hour run each day and 3-4 weeks with no running.  The best I can get from the 35 with no runs is maybe 5-6 days.Issue #3 :  the Forerunner 35 is far more fragile than the 25.  The first day I wore it I somehow chipped the side of the case, two weeks later while running I caught my toe on a raised piece of sidewalk and took a tumble;  while I wasn’t hurt, the band snapped and the Watch face was damaged, suffering a crack across the screen and a chunk broken out of the corner of the display when it landed about 20 feet away.  It still functions but the GPS uptake time has greatly increased.So in summary, the 35 is good but the screen is easily damaged.  The model 25 has a wide bezel to protect the screen while the model 35 does not, this leaves the model 35 screen completely unprotected if you take a fall, the heart rate is inaccurate by at least 10%.  But it does have a wide range of functions and the gps seams accurate.  A What I won’t do is wear it as my day-to-day watch, as I do with my older model 25.  The 35 is pretty expensive and just too easy to damage for daily use.Update:  May 20, my Garmin 35 has pretty much given up.  Today, during my morning run I noticed that the screen is now only half visible, the other half is completely black, and both the GPS and Bluetooth seem to have quit as well.  I can only assume that the fall I had in late January caused severe damage internally and now the watch is done.  I’ve reverted to using my Garmin 25 with chest strap, the model 35 is now wiped out, I won’t replace it.This review needs an update.  Like some others I had some issues, most were caused by a fall that chipped the screen and caused functional problems.  I called Garmin and explained I had damaged the watch and Garmin replaced it at no charge.  The replacement looked new and  Functioned properly.  During my conversation it’s the Garmin representative he gave me some hints to get the best from it, i detail these below because I had never seen them elsewhere.1.  Heart rate monitor responds poorly, often “sticking” at some obviously wrong count. I.e. showing 8 bpm when I’m running an 8 min pace and my hr should be about 160+.2.  Slow/incorrect response doing intervals and other similar response problems.There were problems with the initial GPS uptake at new locations as well so I called Garmin support and talked with a very helpful tech savvy guy who was able to cure all of the complaints in just a few minutes.First, make sure the “Garmin Connect” app is on your phone, Bluetooth is enabled and the FR35 and phone are paired.  Wait until they sync.  Next fully charge the watch then shutdown the watch by holding the top left button on the watch until “Shutdown” is displayed then select yes and the watch will shutdown and the screen will blank.Shutdown fully powers off the watch. Now leave it powered off for at least 12 hours then take it outside where you have a clear view of the Eastern sky and press the same button used to shutdown the watch briefly, this and the 12 hour shutdown will have the watch restart all of its OS components, reconnect all GPS components and reset clocking as well as doing some internal house keeping by clearing out stale files and freeing up operating memory.  All this is kind of like rebooting Windows, cures a bunch of problems.Now that the watch has been restarted and settled down, go wash you’re hands, especially the place on your wrist where the back of the watch will be, also clean the back of the watch as well.  Now go for a run, you’ll probably find that the problems you had before are gone.  That’s how it was with my watch.  Now it’s my habit to reboot before every run and the last six months have been completely trouble free.

    Good running watch with a few disappointing shortcomings
  
",3.0,BillyH,"Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2018","









  
  
    
  I purchased an Apple Watch primarily for running and discovered it's not very well suited to that purpose.  So I thought I'd try the well-priced Garmin 35.  It's much better as a pure running watch, but still has a few shortcomings that make me hesitant to switch.PROS:I love the form factor.  It's easy to read, light and easy to wear and battery life is excellent (several days vs. maybe 24 hours with Apple Watch).  The band is stretchy, so you can put it on snugly and still be comfortable, which can be good if you find your watch feels too loose after you get warmed up during your workout.Wrist heart rate monitor works well.  I love having average and max heart rate.  I like to check my heart rate after a particularly difficult interval or hill climb. I like being able to see graphs of heart rate over the course of a run (more below).GPS seems reasonably accurate.  It also did not take too long to acquire satellites at the beginning of a run.The watch makes lots of data available, both during run (values displayed are configurable - yay!) and after via Garmin Connect (including heart rate vs. pace and heart rate vs. elevation).Price was very reasonable.CONS:You can't download custom workouts from Garmin Connect to the watch.  You can only create simple interval workouts on the watch with identical repeats of one effort interval followed by one recovery interval.  It's not possible to do a ladder or mix different distances for your effort laps.  Don't even think of trying to start 400 intervals every 2:00 or 2:30 minutes (though you can put a 0:30 or 1:00 rest between intervals and that works great, if that's what you're into).  When I complained about the lack of interval diversity to a running buddy, he said ""You can create those workouts on Garmin Connect and download them to the watch.""  That's true for other Garmin models, but not the 35.-Switching units between miles (for long runs) and km (for track workouts) requires about a million button presses.  Also, it requires you to use km, although I suspect most people think of their track work in terms of meters, not kilometers.  So if you want to run 1200's, you either run .75 miles (not the same) or 1.2 km (the same, but not how I'm used to thinking of it).  Also, I'm not sure what the implications are for Garmin Connect when you change your units on the watch.  Ideally, I'd even be able to see my 400 splits, for example, after I run 1200 intervals, but this is not possible either.  Garmin Connect will only show your lap splits and your lap distance can only be one mile or one km.-Using Garmin Connect requires a Bluetooth connection to a smartphone - there's no wifi.  I don't really need to look at my workout on my tiny phone screen, especially since the watch itself shows a pretty good summary.  I'd much rather look at it in a browser on my PC.  But to do that, first I have to make a Bluetooth connection with my phone.  Seems like an extra step I'd rather avoid by syncing via wifi.  Also, a few times the watch has had difficulty establishing the Bluetooth connection with the phone.  I've never experienced that problem with the Apple Watch.NITS:=UI for interval workouts takes some getting used to.  I've found myself running without having the lap timer started.  I've also had trouble figuring out how to restart an interval workout after a pause (hey, I needed a bathroom break).  I've pressed the lap button and the pause button on the opposite side simultaneously by accident multiple times.  I put this as a nit because I like to assume that I'll get used to it, although I'm not sure I ever managed to remember all the button functions on my old Timex Ironman - especially when I'm in the middle of a grueling workout.  Some better usability testing may have been helpful here.=I had to turn Autopause off because I didn't have confidence in it.  It seemed too quick to pause and too slow to restart.  After I recommenced running for 10-20 meters and looked at the watch only to see it still had not started, I turned autopause off permanently.=When I do my track workouts, according to the Garmin, I usually end up having to run a few extra strides beyond where I started to complete my interval distance.  This happened whether I had my units set to miles or km.  I've only tried the watch during multiple workouts on the same pretty old track, though, so I haven't really explored this nit.SUMMARYAs disappointed as I am in the Apple Watch as a running watch, I'm not switching to the Garmin until they address at least the first two items under CONS above.  I feel certain the CONS I mention above are purely in the software, so hopefully they'll enhance some of those capabilities in a future update.  If not, maybe Garmin needs to release a Forerunner 40 that handles those features better.  The higher end Garmins may already cover those complaints, but they're too expensive for a running watch and not sufficiently capable for a smart watch.

    Decent running watch with a few flaws that you may or may not care about.
  
",4.0,Nat,"Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2019","









  
  
    
  After extensive research about different running watch and fitness tracker manufacturers and models, I wore the Garmin Forerunner 35 and the Fitbit Charge 3 on the same wrist for several days and conducted a detailed comparative analysis of their data (think spreadsheets with multiple tabs and graphs). The metrics I looked at included daily resting heart rate, steps, calories, distance, and sleep. I also examined activity data, i.e., distance, average heart rate, average pace, and calories during my runs and dog walks.At the end of the day, the two fitness trackers gave fairly consistent data, with variance usually at or below 5%, an acceptable margin all things considered. However, after this experience, and despite LOVING the Forerunner 35's built-in GPS (which the Charge 3 lacks), I chose to go with the Fitbit for three reasons:1) The Fitbit has more frequent heart rate sampling -- the sensors measure it every 5 seconds while resting, compared to what appeared to be measurements every minute(?) for the Garmin. I realized this because I noticed that the Fitbit's green LEDs were always on, but they were frequently off (not flashing) on the Garmin and would only come on periodically. Presumably this is to save battery life on the Forerunner.Practically speaking, this meant that stats over a longer period of time (such as average heart rate during a 45-minute run, or resting heart rate for the day) were fairly comparable between the two. But if I wanted to get my current heart rate at a glance, the Fitbit was usually spot on as soon as I looked at the device, whereas the Garmin was sometimes 30 bpm too high or too low. (I am fairly in tune with my resting heart rate so know the Fitbit was accurate in these cases and the Garmin was off -- especially because once the Garmin told me it was 42 bpm, and I know my resting heart rate is more in the high 50s.)Once the Forerunner realized I was trying to look at heart rate data, it would start flashing its LEDs and the number would then either decrease or increase to pretty much match what the Fitbit was showing me from the get-go. This is a minor issue that wouldn't compromise the integrity of heart rate data in the long run -- after all, relative trends over time are what these sorts of devices are best for -- but I got annoyed by seeing incorrect numbers and having to wait 10-15 seconds for the Forerunner to adjust.2) The Forerunner's sleep tracking wasn't as accurate as the Fitbit. I think this comes down to an issue of sensor sensitivity and/or how algorithms interpret the sensor data on the back end. Basically, the Forerunner was consistently telling me that I was getting anywhere from 20-45 minutes more sleep than the Fitbit every night. I have a good sense of knowing how I feel with N hours of sleep, and I think the Forerunner was overestimating.Further evidence for this hypothesis is that one night, I got up around 4 a.m. to go to the bathroom and check on my dog. The next morning, this few minutes of ""awake"" time and the steps I took were reflected in my Fitbit data, but not the Garmin data. Basically, the Forerunner somehow missed that I woke up, got out of bed and walked to the bathroom down the hall, walked to the living room, and walked back to bed. The missing steps are not important to me, but how did the device not catch on to the fact that I was awake? Surely it should've picked up on that based on my heart rate and movement.3) The Garmin’s step counting was overzealous. The Forerunner 35 consistently told me I was doing more steps per day than the Charge 3, sometimes only by 200-300 steps but other times by 800-900 steps. That’s an almost 10% margin if you’re aiming for 10,000 steps per day.I’m guessing one reason for this is that the Fitbit allows you to adjust settings in the app for wear on your dominant vs. non-dominant wrist, the former resulting in algorithms that err on the side of excluding movements that may not be steps. Garmin’s devices do not appear to have this setting, meaning they are probably overcounting by interpreting some non-step movements as steps.4) I'm a fairly petite person (5'2"", 120 lbs) and the Forerunner 35 was a bit too big for my taste. The screen's length pretty much occupied the entirety of my wrist width, and it was pretty thick too. I occasionally had trouble pulling my sleeves up if my clothes were fitted, such as with long-sleeved base layers -- which I would wear while running, precisely when I wanted to see the watch. Obviously an issue of preference, but I found it mildly annoying.In conclusion, I would say that none of these is a deal breaker if what you really want out of the Forerunner is a decent GPS running watch. Its built-in GPS is truly wonderful, the auto-lap feature is super convenient, and the customizable data fields for workouts are fantastically brilliant. It's uber functional without any superfluous or overly complicated frills, and I especially love that it has the day of the week and date shown on its always-on display. Battery life is competitive, especially for a GPS watch. However, when push comes to shove, I personally prefer more reliable data. I couldn't keep using it and raising an eyebrow every time the information the device gave me didn't match what I know about my own body.

That improved, for a while, by keeping the battery fully charged (I'd put it on the charger whenever the battery indicator had less than four bars, nearly every night).  Then it stopped being reliable: it wouldn't even read my heart rate.  I put the monitor above my wrist bone as recommended in the instructions.  I put it right at my wrist joint, I put it on my other arm, in both locations.  Some times it would read, other times it wouldn't.  Because of this ""average heart rate"" was often wildly low.  Oh, and I thought perhaps the hair on my arm was interfering, so I used my clippers to trim my hair where the monitor goes.  Performance was unimproved.I now have it synched to the chest strap monitor/ transmitter from my old Garmin.  We'll see how long that will work.Good news: I am not an elite athlete so I need only some basic functions: heart rate, distance, time, pace.  This monitor provides many many more features, some of which I like and now use.  I like that it can separate running, cycling, and cardio.  I like that it reports resting, average, momentary/ current and maximum heart rate.  I like that Garmin Connect can report V02 max, but why not for cardio exercise?

  Read the reviews before purchasing this watch.  Mostly hit and miss so I was skeptical.  The GPS tracking on this watch is just horrible.  It shows me running way off the beaten path, sometimes hundreds of yards from the trail/road.  The HR monitor is good at taking resting pulse and that's about it.  The watch is not good at transferring data and takes forever to find satellites before your activity.  Don't waste your money!

    Not Accurate as a Heart Rate Monitor
  
",2.0,S. K.,"Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2017","









  
  
    
  I bought the Garmin 35 primarily as a heart rate monitor.  I wanted a monitor that looked like a watch; didn't want to deal with the Fitbit type screens.  The Garmin is a nice looking watch; looks a little like the Apple watch.  I used a Polar heart rate monitor for many years but got tired of dealing with the chest strap so I did alot of research and settled on the Garmin 35.  This is a roundabout way of saying I am very familiar with tracking my heart rate.Been using the Garmin 35 for about 3 months now and use it often.  It's pretty good in everything except heart rate accuracy.  With that, it's pretty bad.  If it was off by a certain amount each time, I could sort of estimate what the rate really is by adding something to the number to get in the ballpark.  But, it's wildly inconsistent to the point of almost uselessness.  There are times when my heart is beating strongly during strenuous exercise and the Garmin shows a resting number.  Other times, it'll be off but within an acceptable range.  Other times, it'll be reasonably accurate.  If working out at the gym, I can use one of machine monitors to compare the Garmin.  Before you ask, I'm familiar with how to maintain a monitor; I clean it regularly.  The Polar ones I used trained me well.Aside from looking good,  it holds a charge pretty well.  I get at least a few days between charges.  It has other nice features.  But, if you're looking for an accurate heart rate monitor, I don't think this is the answer.

At the gym, I can be jogging on the treadmill and it will show my heart rate at 99bpm.  I will then measure my heart rate on the treadmill and it will tell me I'm at 134.  All I can say about my Garmin is that it accurately tells time.  None of the other features on my watch are reliable.

    Needed to write this review because I can't believe all the negative ones I read before buying this
  
",5.0,hope,"Reviewed in the United States May 18, 2019","









  
  
    
  Before I bought this watch, I researched for months many different running watches before I made my decision. I kept coming back to this watch, but was delaying due to the negative reviews. Let me tell you who this watch is/isn't for. Sidenote I've had an Apple Watch before and I absolutely hated it. People think when they get the watch they will use it to call/text but come on, the screen is so small anyways, I'd get irritated and never use it for those features. The one feature I did like, the sleep tracker, I never used because the watch would die like every day and I'd have to charge it at night in order to use it the next day! Super irritating. Also, mileage was ALWAYS off when running. Like, off by a lot and I could probably have fixed this, but was too lazy to and felt like that shouldn't happen with an Apple Watch.The Garmin watch is meant for a runner. If you aren't such a serious runner maybe running 1-2 miles then I'm sure you can get away with something else but the main reason I needed a watch was to track my mileage and timing ONLY during my daily runs and races. I average around 30 miles per week and so holding my phone while running just wasn't cutting it. I am a millennial and like my technology but I didn't need a damn watch to do all these special features that I had at my disposal before but never used. This was one of the negative comments I kept seeing- how this watch was simple. Well, I just need it to tell me my distance accurately so that's what it's for. Bonus points that it also gives HR continuously and tracks your sleep so to me it's amazing. Also without a touchscreen I don't have to worry about accidentally hitting a button. It's easy and that's all I need. ALSO I only have to charge it like weekly not even that if I actually waited for it to die which I never do. That is huge for me especially after having the Apple Watch. It is GPS acquired and I've run with it on a track and multiple races so I know it's definitely accurate. Had this watch since January and have had no issues. Love when you're done running you can sync the phone easily to come up in the app so you can see everything even in more details. One thing I will address is the pacing. People say the average pace pr mile is slow and takes a while to catch up. While this may be the case, this does not bother me one bit because i've been running for so long I have my pacing down. I'm looking at the time like oh, at 2:00 minutes I am hitting .2, at 3 I should be at  .3, for example. I always know what my mile time is going to be around and it's always at that time so this doesn't bother me at all. In summary, while the watch screen may not be like super fancy looking, I've been over the Apple Watch since I got it and this watch literally does what it's supposed to- accurately give you your running distance and time.

  I have had my Garmin Forerunner 35 watch for about 6 months now and have been using almost daily. I'm a high school cross country runner and I got this watch for the running season. It has been a great watch for tracking runs/ workouts and I have probably ran around 300 mile so far with it. I have found that the battery life for the Forerunner 35 has been exceptionally great and I could go about 5 days using it with activity's of around 1 hour on one charge (subject to vary depending on how much it is used). When I got done with my running season I only used my watch for the time (using no activities) and I was very surprised that the battery lasted about 20 days or more days! It's really nice to have a watch that doesn't need to be charged all the time. I would recommend getting the Garmin Forerunner 35 for people that are wanting a simple watch for a cheaper price.

  UPDATE: Garmin customer support replaced my watch that wasn't syncing properly, and I love it now! Also, the Garmin app has been updated since I originally wrote this review, and the new version is much nicer to use!Garmin has been making GPS devices for runners for a long time, and that shows in the Forerunner. The Forerunner 35 lets you do things you'd expect on an advanced running GPS, like customize the screens you see during your run with any of roughly a dozen different stats. Things like distance, pace, average pace, time, etc. And it can manage things like interval workouts. The device is small (for a GPS watch), and comfortable to wear.The Forerunner 35 is a runner’s GPS, and with my background as a college runner, I appreciated all of the features it offered. Still, it has room for improvement. I had a very difficult time getting it to sync properly with my phone, and ultimately had to do a factory reset on the GPS before it would sync properly. The Garmin Connect phone app did not feel polished, and I still occasionally get notifications that bluetooth sync failed (although it works again after reconnecting). If Garmin would update their software to fix the bluetooth syncing problems, my review would be 5 stars!The Good  * Syncs to Garmin Connect app & website.  * Customizable screens in run mode - see any stat wherever you want.  * Support for interval training.  * Supports most phone notifications (text, call, calendar, etc).  * Small, comfortable, lightweight.  * You can go back to look at run history on the watch.The Bad  * Had trouble getting bluetooth activity sync to work. (FIXED - see update)  * Garmin Connect app & website have some sync problems, and aren't that easy to use. (FIXED - see update)

Checked this after wearing the watch for a few days. Walked 100 steps and watch showed 81 steps. Not sure if it gets better or worse percentage wise with more steps. Seems like it would be worse.Syncs to phone but app then says no data for any activity or health & performance or anything else. Like it syncs a blank. Online web site not any better even when I hooked watch up through USB cable to upload data to site.Date will not change even after having walked for an hour with the gps activated. Rebooted watch and it said acquiring date and time by GPS but comes back to the same wrong date and time. Can set time manually but not date.  Instruction for watch not very in depth, had to find independent videos online for in depth operation and use of features.Likely going to return this watch at 169.00 I think more of the advertised features should work better than they do and some do not work at all.  Update to previous review. I exchanged the first watch for another Forerunner 35. The replacement watch functions as advertised and all bugs of previous watch are now non issues with new unit. Amazon made the exchange process ridiculously easy and efficient which I suppose is why they are so successful. Received replacement 2 days after I opted for the exchange.  I was offered options of speaking to a tech rep, exchange or refund. Fortunately I chose exchange.

  I bought two of these watches to replace a set of Forerunner 10s that my wife and I have used for over 5 years. The long life of the 10s really pushed me towards the 35. The only problems we had with the 10s were a band replacement and eventually poor battery life (this was the killer).Our new 35s arrived and one of them had defect on the screen (-1 star). Otherwise, both watches worked fine. Since another reviewer had mentioned a screen defect that got worse over time, I decided to exchange the watch. Amazon promptly handled this exchange. The new watch did not have any noticeable screen defect.I replaced the band on my watch. I got the green band originally. The quality of the band was fine, but there was something I didn't expect. I bought this watch intending to use it as a running watch only. However, I've grown to like the smart watch features and the day tracking stuff. I bought a more subdued band to fit in better with my daily attire.This watch really is great. In fact, it's almost too great for the price point. The only feature missing is a swim tracking mode. I feel like this was omitted not because of hardware constraints, but rather to give some people a reason to go with a higher end model.Run tracking accuracy is spot on. I run with several folks who have different, more expensive models, and all of our data lines up perfectly.Garmin Connect continues to be great. I like the Android App and the website.Overall, I happily recommend the Forerunner 35.

  My favorite feature is the ""clothes pin"" adapter to the charger.

It only worked if I paired it through the Garmin CONNECT App.  I have other devices that have this quirk, so I didn't waste a lot of time there.I will use it for running, though I'm primarily a cyclist and use a Garmin 520 Edge.

  The current average price of the Forerunner 35 is a bargain for a very good - 50 meter waterproof rated - fitness tracker. This tracker/watch will provide those who perform moderate to intermediate fitness activities all the fitness data they'll likely want; and it will do it quite accurately. When it first debued 4 years ago, it was one of the top devices for the price.Today, Garmin and many other manufacturers have tracker/watches that provide a wide array of features and apps that the Forerunner35 can't deliver, but those are about 3x more costly. So, at 1/3rd the price of the latest devices, if you're a moderate-intermediate fitness oriented person looking for an accurate waterproof tracker, this will likely satisfy you with all the data you will be interested in.

I run daily in the morning and before my watch I was running an average of 4 miles. Now tracking my miles I’m running 6.5 to 7 miles, seeing my distance pushes me to improve pace and to keep increasing distance.  My main features I am interested in is to track my Miles, my Pace and my Heart Rate, and tracking my HIIT calorie burn during my garage workouts. I cannot speak about the other features I’m not using, such is sleep tracking, or text alerts, etc. Bottom line, I love my GARMIN Watch and super happy and satisfied with my purchase!

  So I've taken up running recently to get in shape and lose some weight.  I was looking for something to track my running or other activities with GPS and heart rate.  I also wanted something with great battery life to take the place of my Pebble.  I thought the Forerunner 35 was going to be the watch.  While I'm very pleased with the battery life and simple display, the thing I'm most disappointed in is the alarm.  It would be more functional to be able to set up alarms from the phone app and have the option to set alarms for specific days.  Also when the phone rings the vibration should continue instead of just occurring once.

  Since purchasing this watch in March, 2017, I have used it extensively. I loved it - it was perfect for what I needed during my runs and bike rides. Heart rate monitoring can be a off in a HIT workout setting, but in general the average is okay. Sleep tracking is not great, but not supper important to me. Overall, this watch perfectly suited my needs and is easy to use, however after 2.5 years, it can no longer connect to GPS. It doesn't have any physical damage and it is in otherwise good conditions. Without a functioning GPS, this watch no longer suits my needs. When I contacted support about the issue, they said the warranty only covers one year and the best they could offer me was a 20% discount on a different model or a refurbished replacement for $80. Both options would require me to send them broken watch.  I would not recommend this watch if it means buying a replacement every few years at a cost of around one to a few hundred dollars.Overall, great watch but the longevity leaves a lot to be desired.

    Not a good option for runners in training
  
",3.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2018","









  
  
    
  Are you a runner looking to take training to the next level, but can't afford a really pricey device? Wondering why in the world you'd even need one? I was in your shoes! As an activity tracker, the Forerunner 35 is very nice. I give it 3 stars because many of the features that a runner would use don't work, and I feel it's deceptive to sell a device with these features when they're not really usable for training. Essentially, this is a good activity tracker posing (ineffectively) as a training tool.Many reviewers mention that the Forerunner 35 isn't for ""serious runners"", and I took that to mean that they believe ""serious runners"" need all the complexity of a very expensive watch. I need to know pacing, HR, distance, time. Fancy analytics, realistically, aren't going to do a lot for my running. So really, this watch has everything a serious runner needs. The reason I believe reviewers say the device isn't for serious runners is that none of those features actually works in a way that is useful to someone trying to train seriously. The watch has pacing, heart rate and distance information, interval programming, virtual pacing (it notifies you when you deviate from a set pace), etc. However, in reality, most of these features don't work well enough to matter during a training session. You can get a nice ballpark pace during your slow runs, but it's pretty useless for speed work and can become really frustrating. Here's the rundown:Pros:HR monitor works very wellFor general pacing info on easy runs, the price is good and the device is adequateAfter initially updating with the GarminExpress app, satellite acquisition is quickCons (for runners):1. Pacing - this is the feature that really drives me nuts. It can take up to 3 minutes to catch up to your pacing change - for example, during interval work it takes a long time for the device to figure out how fast you're going after a ""down"" piece, resulting in huge spikes in pacing as you overcompensate because the device hasn't caught up to you and you think you're running too slow. I've raced with it, and as long as I didn't make any really drastic pace changes it was ok. But it's pretty useless for interval work.2. Virtual Pacer doesn't work - you have to be way, way off pace for a long, long time before it notifies you that your pacing is off, which is useless for intervals/tempo work. They seem to have given it almost a full minute/mile buffer on pace notifications. Also, you can't change the desired pace during a run, so your warm-up and cool-down and any intentional pace changes will set off constant notifications3. AutoPause doesn't work - you'll need to pause manually. It takes 3-4 seconds for the watch to start and stop, meaning you have large spikes in your data4. Intervals - you can only set one interval time and then run it over and over, which runners don't really do. So no ladders, cut-downs, etc. I still have to carry my phone on interval/speed work days so I have a useful interval timer. On the upside, you can program it to leave you alone during warm up and cool down, and start the intervals at any point during your runAll-in-all, although it's very useful to have a pacing device for my runs, I greatly regret not spending a little more to get a better device for training, but I already blew my budget, so after a little live-and-learn and some REALLY frustrating training sessions, I decided to write this review. No, I still don't believe you need fancy analytics from a really expensive watch to be a better runner. But I strongly recommend you find out just how well a device's features actually work before buying.

  This is the best option for someone who wants to get GPS and heartrate monitoring without paying for more stuff they won't use. The screen is very simple and monochrome and because of this the battery life is very good. It lasts for over a week before I need a charge, at least in the first couple months. The cycle time will diminish over the long term like any battery but it doesn't need to see the charger for over a week with regular use. The cell phone notifications are handy and you can tailor which apps come thru on the watch, so you can read texts or emails etc and filter other notifications. The sleep tracking is not very good but that's not the point of this watch. I love the thing and use it all the time, gives me good data for Strava which is my primary use for it. My training is definitely better off with it.

  I have had previous Garmin products and hate to say anything bad about them, but this product has issues. I am currently waiting for my 3rd replacement in one year. The manual states that the product is waterproof up to 50 M and it is not. The customer service reps say that mine may have been failing because I am plugging them into a wall, not an into a computer USB. However, whenever it fails the screen starts to get a halo or what looks like a water ring around the screen that progresses into the screen pixilating. Customer service has been excellent, but I don't want to ship the product back every 3 months. I just expect it to be waterproof if it is advertised to be waterproof. I use this every day to run, and it gets exposed to rain, sweat, etc. I do not swim with the product, but I also do not take it off to wash my hands. It has not been abused. When it works it is everything I could hope for, the GPS is accurate, the GPS is quick, the sleep monitoring is accurate, syncs with my phone great, and the heart rate monitor is accurate.  I am currently doing research into a better product because I have passed the 1yr warranty phase and I am certain this replacement will fail too.

  The information may be hidden somewhere in the product materials but I didn't see it before buying. The watch band has latex in it. That became very apparent after I started wearing it for extended periods. I had to glue some cloth strips on the underside to be able to wear it. It also turns out the chest band HR monitor also has latex in it.The wrist sensor for pulse rate is a random number generator unless you crank it down to the point it's uncomfortable. Even then, it has random changes in HR that have nothing to do with activity. If you want accurate HR, you need the chest band sensor. However the unit uses the wrist pulse by default, so if you are not recording an activity, you have at best an approximate.The unit is surprising good on tracking indoor treadmill distance for me, it's usually within 0.02 for a 3 mile run.The elevation changes are much closer to actual numbers than my previous units.The choice of activities to record is limited so I'm often going back after synchronization and changing the category. However, it does have the common ones and it's easy to switch.Overall, I wound not buy it again because of the latex problem. If that's not your issue, it's a good unit at reasonable cost.

    The Forerunner 35 + footpad as a treadmill training and fitness tracker
  
",3.0,Gimlet Eye,"Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2018","









  
  
    
  If I were a runner who ran mostly outdoors, I would probably give the Garmin Forerunner 35 five stars, but I'm obliged to rate it instead according to its value to me, and even though I may not be the typical user, I can see no reason why better design decisions couldn't, in most cases, made it just as useful to me.  However, because, as a crackerjack programmer and software designer myself, my expectations for the functional designs of computer-based systems of others are quite low, so I was not unduly disappointed by my purchase.I expected at least, that the Garmin would provide me with an accurate GPS-based reading of time over distance for my infrequent outside workouts and races, and on that it delivers well - both with accurate readings, fast GPS acquisition, and so far no dropouts even though some one of my courses follows a winding road up a wooded mountain.Also, I didn't necessarily suppose that I'd find much use or interest in the device as a fitness tracker, and that I wouldn't want to wear it 24/7, but in that respect it provided me with a pleasant surprise.  It's small size, comfortable band, and highly legible readout without illumination, all make it desirable to wear just as a watch, and the HR and fitness tracking data are just gravy - interesting, if not always reliable (more on that below).I am, in fact, a competitive speed walker who mostly trains indoors on the treadmill, so I also purchased the Garmin footpad accessory in the hopes that it would help me to cross-calibrate the various treadmills I use with each other and with my actual speed, but in that respect the reported Forerunner + footpad results have been puzzling and unreliable.  The functionality of the footpad, which laces into one's shoes, is supposed to based on an accelerometer that provides an estimate of stride length, and in some way this is supposed to be further calibrated for accuracy by wearing the footpad while training outside with the GPS also enabled.  I suppose that the GPS measures the distance, while the footpad accelerometer at least counts the number of strides over various sampled distances, and (if its program were sufficiently sophisticated) might be able to correlate variations in acceleration with particular over the ground speeds - but no documentation is provided by Garmin on the programming so one can only guess about this.Be that as it may, the actual speed/pace results the Garmin reports on training sessions of various treadmills where, as usual, I exercise at constant speeds for most of the session (anywhere from 40-120 minutes, typically), are far from the steady constant speed one presumes for the treadmills themselves.  I do much of my training on my home treadmill, which is of pretty good quality, but I also go to the gym and use many of their expensive and robust treadmills, and the least I would expect from the Garmin is that it would report an even pace for the long stretches when the treadmill speed doesn't vary.  But that's not what I get.in the first place, instead of an even constant pace line, I get a Garmin readout consisting exclusively of up and down spikes which bounce around the treadmill-reported pace by several % each way.  That might be OK provided there was a way to derive the exact average for particular training stretches, but as it is the only thing I can do is to eyeball the graph and make a crude estimate of the average. The Garmin needs to smooth the data instead of reporting it as a series of inaccurate spikes.But that's a minor problem compared to the other anomaly I've encountered in my constant pace sessions: the spiky Garmin-reported pace often sags across a session, with my average pace declining, say, from 5.2mph to 4.9mph, but then sometimes the pace seems to climb a gentle slope from lower to higher, and besides all that, there are occasional dropback spikes to much lower paces, even though I, and the treadmill belt, are just plugging along at one and the same pace throughout.Thus, one of the two main reasons I got this Garmin + footpad (total price well over $200), to give me a way of independently checking the reported speeds of the various treadmill speeds I use, has been frustrated, and neither customer service, nor the sketchy manual have been able to offer any cogent explanation for these anomalies.Given the extensive functionality claimed for this device as a tracker of fitness, goals, personal bests and stuff like that, there are a number of other problems with the Garmin Forerunner 35.  For example, it has modes that are supposed to be customized for walkers as well as runners, both inside and outside (differentiating GPS based walking from inside footpad-measured walking) and there are also modes for biking and for ""cardio"" (whatever that is).  Yet personal bests over various classic distances like the 5k, are only reported for running - which I don't do - I'm a competitive speed walker or race walker, and am faster than many runners over the distances I do, yet my records don't get registered.Calorie TrackingThe device undercounts calories for me both because it apparently treats the hundreds of stairs I climb each day as flat walking, and, more importantly, it undercounts the calories for the fast treadmill walking I do by from 5-15% compared to the online ExRX calculator (at https://www.exrx.net/Calculators/WalkRunMETs) which is based on American College of Sports Medicine data.  And since the ExRx calculator also undercounts calories for the speeds I walk at (5mph and up), the Garmin undercounts by some 10-20%.  For anyone else in my boat, who does speed walking or race walking, I suggest that they multiply the ExRx results by about 1.1 if their speeds are in the 5-5.5mph ranges.  I've worked out this factor based on comparisons between the graphs for the running and race walking world records that the World Masters Athletics organization has come up with and built into their own WMA Age-Grading calculator (at http://www.howardgrubb.co.uk/athletics/wmalookup06.html) which also permits level playing field performance comparisons between people of different ages.Heart Rate TrackingWhen I get up after sitting for a while, walk down the hall and climb a set of stairs, or conversely, after moving around I trot downstairs then sit down and check my HR, I get counts that are highly volatile and way out of line both with the Polar FT7 HR monitor I train with, and for that matter with my measured pulse.  Thus, doing the above might skyrocket my HR to 112 on the Forerunner display, which then settles down rapidly, say by 10 beats every few seconds until it gets back to my actual rate in the 60s, 50s, and 40s - all within the compass of 20-30 seconds.  My actual HR virtually never gets above the high 80s after climbing the stairs, or the high 70s if I'm just walking down the hall.  It appears that these wild fluctuations are somehow smoothed out and ignored in what the watch stores because they don't leave such wild peaks in the 4 hour rolling HR report display or in the HR graph that displays when I upload the data.  Why, then, doesn't the dynamic watch display work the same way - smoothing out the data like my Polar FT7 does before reporting it in wild misleading swings?  It appears that the same set of poor design decisions were made for HR reporting as for pace reporting.Sleep ReportingI'm not going to comment on the device's differentiation between ""deep sleep"" and ""light sleep"" because these terms are nowhere defined in the sketchy inadequate manual, let alone related to the scientific sleep literature.  I've read and thought a lot about sleep science but the Garmin provides me with nothing of value when it parses my sleep period into these two undefined categories, punctuated with occasional slivers of wakefulness, which don't necessarily correspond with my actual state of consciousness.  What does matter to me though, is my heart rate during sleep, because I have, all my long life as a distance athlete, used my resting pulse (RP) as an indicator of fitness, or the lack thereof, and as a warning sign of undue stress or overtraining.  But the Garmin reporting of HR, and what it calls ""average resting heart rate"" (ARHR) has it's own anomalies.For example, when I went to bed last night my ARHR was 45bpm.  According to the graph of my HR for this sleep period (based on the uploaded data), my total sleep period was 6:30.  During the first 4 minutes, my average pulse was about 48, and during the night there were five short spikes up into the 50s ranging from 1-4 minutes, and for some fraction of a minute my pulse reached 66. The first of the three times I got up to pee the Garmin showed that my ARHR had by that time dropped to 44, indicating that even though customer service told me that ARHR is an average over the last 7 sleep periods, my ARHR when I went to bed was close to 44 - which tracks with readings of the previous night, which also dropped intranight to 44.However, last night, except for those 4-5 brief intervals, which totaled about 10 minutes across the duration of my 6:30 sleep period, the graph of my HR shows a resting pulse that ranged from 34-44, with the average for the night being about 40.  Yet at the end of my sleep period my ARHR had gone back up to 45!How did customer service explain this anomaly?  Apparently the device ignores any resting pulses below 40 as artifacts, and since my RP was in the 30's for about an hour and a half, and since this wasn't even counted in averaging over the night (which gave more weight to the brief periods when my RP was in the high 40s and 50s) there was no drop in my ARHR, and in fact, over the last 6 months I've only briefly ever gotten it down to 44, even though my actual RP for the night is typically around 10-42, except on the nights after intense training sessions.Despite these evident software design flaws, my overall impression of Garmin, and even of the Forerunner 35, is positive.  Customer service is good to excellent, with actual Americans at the other end (instead of Indians or Filipinos working from a script), who are at least familiar with the workings of the devices they are supporting.  And because English is their native language they are at least able to understand the more probing questions I ask about how the device was actually programmed to work, though they are seldom able to come up with the answers on their own.  But then even their supervisors or the experts they go away and consult with are apparently in the dark about how the device is programmed, and as is to be expected these days of minimal American literacy the manual is barely adequate as a guide to the operation of the device, and quite inadequate to explain the meaning of the various readouts, which renders the whole thing of dubious value once you venture beyond the bounds of its core functionality - i.e. GPS tracking of time over distance.

  I am using every feature available on the Forerunner 35 and I am super impressed. I track my sleep every night, use it for running in the gym or for trail runs outdoors. The app has so many features and much more to do/add. I Synced my Garmin with my Galaxy S9 and my Fleet Feet app so far. Since having this I have been much more motivated and staying on top of how much water I drink each day. It is very accurate!

    Mostly great, one major flaw, custom stride length does not work.
  
",3.0,JB,"Reviewed in the United States November 19, 2017","









  
  
    
  My Fitbit HR Charge was wearing out after only 18 months of use, so I did a lot of research on which fitness tracker to buy.  I selected the Forerunner 35 based on many reviews.  After almost one month of use and can say mostly good things about it.  The major pluses are: - Very long battery life, I've only had to charge it twice in 24 days of use; - Bright, big, readable screen.  I use readers for close up viewing, but don't need glasses to see the screen.  I used to wear a watch on one wrist and my Fitbit HR on the other, and now I only need one device. - The GPS function sync's and works properly, I see some others have had problems but it worked fine for me; - Allowing the alerts to come from your iPhone is great, I can see who is calling, texting, etc. without having to get my phone; - I haven't been in the pool yet, but assuming its okay, being waterproof is a great plus.Here are a few things that didn't work so well: - One major flaw for me - the custom stride length doesn't work.  Outside you measure your distance via GPS so stride length doesn't matter.  Inside, on the treadmill however, the unit guesses stride length.  In ""User Settings"" you can set custom stride length for walking and running and it just doesn't work at all.  For me, even though I set the custom stride length...the unit consistently under reports my distances by 5% to 10%.  It's very frustrating. - The user interface on the App for your phone is a little clunky.  I much prefer the Fitbit dashboard, but maybe that's because I've used it so much longer.I was thinking about returning the unit because of the custom stride length problem, but overall the other pluses outweigh this one major flaw.  I'm hopeful Garmin will fix this in a future update.  I would have given the unit 5 starts otherwise.

",4.0,Salt,"Reviewed in the United States April 12, 2019","









  
  
    
  Received as a gift, and like it overall. Generally, I think the operating system and user interface could use some more thought. Some obvious things missing and left out. Few specific quirks:1. Sometime I feel like the heartbeat tracking is off during runs - will jump from 158 to like 120 for a minute or vice versa.2. No way to store an owner ID, emergency contacts, or identifying info on the watch.3. Would be nice to be able to silence alerts (ie, heart zone alerts) in the middle of a workout rather than quitting and restarting. Yes, it asks if one wants an alert - but how about if I want to spend two miles in zone 3, then do sprints? It just alerts the whole time with no way to silence. Such a glaring UI problem.4. Sometimes the GPS takes several minutes to lock on before a run.5. The Garmin iOS App is also sort of clunky, and I've had issues with the watch not consistently syncing, once even requiring deleting the device from the app and reloading it to get it connecting again.All that said, i generally like it, and appreciate that they didn't try to stuff the OS with ""smart watch"" features. They kept it to being a watch that tracks exercise with GPS, and can deliver some phone notifications. Alas, like so many things with Garmin, it's only 3/4 of the way thought through and the end product lacks some obvious things.

This one has been functional so far, and I usually just wear it all the time.

    GPS fails to record distance accurately
  
",1.0,C. Olsen,"Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  We were so excited to get this new Garmin, but it's a disappointment as it does not record distance accurately. For my initial test, it took 20 minutes in Wait mode while finding satellites. Then the recording for my run displayed an absurd amount of drift, showing me cutting every corner and flitting through yards and houses like Superman. The resulting mileage and pace were highly distorted. (This is an inner suburb where there should not be such problems... we are not in a remote location nor anyplace near tall buildings or mountains.) I then tried the Garmin an hour later for a track workout. This time it was already warmed up from the prior run, so it found the satellites quickly, within 2 or 3 minutes. My run was 6+ miles, i.e. slightly over 1.5 miles each way to/from the track plus 12 laps around. Of those 6+ miles total, the Garmin recorded 5.1 miles.  We were looking for a simple and accurate running watch, but the Forerunner 35 failed the tests. We will try to return it and find something else.

Also, a bonus is that you can sync the my fitness pal app to it and it will log your calorie intake each day. The GPS on outdoor runs seems to be pretty accurate (although not for treadmill runs).Cons: It doesn't really allow you to create workouts on the watch, only in the app. The metrics do not include meters, which would be helpful for workouts on the track. The band is a little cheap and flimsy compared to other watches, such as the apple watch or fit bit.All in all, I am happy with this watch and it does what I need it to do. Great for runs.

",2.0,mn_beachgal,"Reviewed in the United States December 19, 2018","









  
  
    
  This product is great, IF you can get it to consistently detect your heart rate.  First, if you buy the Garmin strap and have a small frame the strap won't work at all - it won't pick up your heart rate and is not snug even if pulled as tight as possible.  The workaround to that is to use a Polar strap and cut the rubber around the sensors. This does the trip, most of the time. But I'd say at least half (if not more) of the time I look at the watch it just shows 3 lines on it - meaning it can't find my heart rate. So pretty much makes the watch completely useless.I've been using the watch for about 9 months now and although it worked ok for biking, it seems for cardio classes it just can not consistently detect my heart rate. My old Polar watch, although much less fancy, never had this issue. I am just about to consider junking this watch or selling it on ebay and buying a Polar watch as I hardly even wear the watch now since it's not accurate.

    Affordable smartwatch with long battery life
  
",5.0,M. Walker,"Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is my first smartwatch - I resist putting money into technology that obsoletes quickly, and $99 is my threshold for rapidly changing tech - so when this dropped to that I finally bit.What is great:- 7+ day battery life.  I just charge weekly. That includes a daily workout of about 30 minutes - every other workout is with GPS on - I alternate between stationary bike and outdoor running.- Size is reasonable - I have fairly small wrists for a guy and it does not look huge.- Cost is reasonable.- Is a HRM and GPS, and also supports all the other ANT+ Garmin sensors - I have it connected to a Garmin speed/distance puck on my stationary bike and I believe it will attach to Cadence, Power, and running pucks/sensors.  HRM seems accurate relative to the HR strap I formerly used.  Resting HR seems low though.- Garmin Connect links to all of the other popular apps - I've used Endomondo for the past 5 years and Connect interfaces seamlessly to that so I have one place to store all my workout data.  I also have it connected to MyFitnessPal for calorie tracking.  All of that works perfectly and automatically.- Does a good job with notifications from your watch.Not so great:- This is a basic watch - monochrome display, no apps or watch faces to install.  Screen resolution is just ok.  You get 6 numeric fields in two pages (plus the clock) to look at during your exercise and some ability to customize those fields.  That's it.- No payment options.  But heck, as the US is so far behind Europe in mobile point-of-sale anyway, does it really matter?  Until restaurants/bars here do what every place in Europe already has you are going to have a credit card with you anyway - I don't see the black tray disappearing anytime soon.- VO2Max is calculated indirectly - no O2 monitor or live metrics.- Does not have the more sophisticated running metrics that I would assume few people actually use.- No swimming metrics.- Is not a Dick Tracy watch.  No phone calls, no videos.- No music storage or control.With all of these devices, the central question is, if you have a good phone already, what do you really need on your wrist?  To me it is 24x7 HRM, something that tells time, step counter, workout logger, and notifier.  I was tired of dealing with an HRM chest strap.  Would it be nice to not have my phone on a run?  Yes.  So at some point I'll probably upgrade, but for $99 I'm ok with that and will wait until a watch with such features has the size, cost, and battery life of this device.  Right now during a run the phone is in a sleeve on my back and the Google Assistant on the earbuds works just fine for everything else.

    HR Monitor Inaccurate
  
",2.0,Jan Chester,"Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  I used the HR function at the Y while on a treadmill to see how accurate it was. I did this because it jumped all over the place when I would simply go for a long walk.When the treadmill showed my heart rate to be 105, the Garmin showed 145. This was consistent throughout the workout. The Garmin continued to show a HR around 20 to 40 beats higher.I love the watch and am really disappointed how ineffective the HR function is so I'm returning the watch.

  I bought this watch because my previous Garmin stopped charging.At first this watch worked fine, but not too long after I got the watch I started training for the LA Marathon and over the few months of training the time it took to sync got slower and slower, to the point where I had to leave the watch to sync over night, yes you read that right, it took several hours to sync.Then last weekend I ran the LA Marathon, I did will, finishing in the top 200 runners and ran a Boston qualifying time, but after the Marathon my Garmin Forerunner 35 would not sync at all, two days later it still had not synced, then finally it seemed like it synced, but in doing so it deleted all data including my LA Marathon.I tried getting support from Garmin but their online support system did not submit.Yes this watch eventually finds satellites, but only if I am completely still, and it has all the basic functions as well as heart rate that is about 50% accurate, but the sync problem is not unique to me. I spent hours searching forums and there are countless examples of this same problem.I am frustrated that this watch lost all my marathon data, at least I have my finish time from the official LA Marathon site, but because I had to run in their open corral and run around about 15000 people the distance I ran was well over 26.2 but I have no record of what my mile splits were or any of the other data from the race I trained so hard for.

  My watch is something I depend on for keeping track of my running and workout miles. Garmin produces consistent quality in their products, and this Forerunner 35 is no exception. The fit is perfect, even though I have a small (OK, kid's size) wrist. I'm a runner mainly, but also a triathlete, and I do weekly Zumba and Jazzercise workouts. The watch is comfortable enough that I can forget I'm even wearing it. I don't feel the need to purchase a more upscale watch because this one does all I need and more.The only drawback I've noticed is that it can take a full 5 minutes to find a signal. That is understood and mentioned by the manufacturer. Just don't wait until start time to hit go. :-) Because of this, I'm giving it a 4-star rating. If it were possible, I'd give it a 4.75.I'm certain to use my Garmin watch for years to come. This is my 3rd in the Garmin series. They haven't failed me yet.

    My accountability buddy
  
",5.0,Smitty,"Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have been casual about exercise until recently, and I bought the Forerunner 35 to track my progress as I’ve begun to set and achieve fitness goals. I didn’t want a smart watch with all the gadgets and frills, just something that can track my mileage, pace, and heart rate. I love the simplicity of this watch! I can easily access the data on my watch during workouts, and I don’t smear the screen with sweat since there are analog buttons instead of touchscreen features. The Connect app tracks and explains vitals and stats, keeping me motivated. Fantastic battery life—I charge it once every 10 days days, but that’s only because I don’t like dipping too close to a dead battery. The watch screen is like paper white from Kindle—super helpful in the sun—but can be backlit with the touch of a button—super helpful in the fading light. The watch has alert features that you can customize—I get a little buzz and notification when I complete my “lap” of a mile or my steps goal or my calorie goal. The Bluetooth connection to my phone is surprisingly nice, too—the watch buzzes only twice when a call’s coming in and gives a notification with the caller name/number, then falls still. It’s the same with any other notification I’d receive on my phone. This has helped me if I’m exercising on call or if I’m with a client to know if I need to whip my phone out of my belt/bag instead of keeping the ringer on and being paranoid. I also really appreciate that the watch tracks my daily activity even when I haven’t “started” an activity to log—I am still forgetful about starting activities when I begin a workout and the auto tracking helps me at least that same day to look back at my heart rate, pace, mileage. And, even if I haven’t logged an activity, the calendar in Connect app logs my daily steps and heart rate. Anyway, to sum it all up, Garmin Forerunner 35 has become a daily necessity to a woman who has worn an analog watch every day for 10 years and LOVES those analog watches. It’s become my accountability buddy!

  My first running watch. It keeps me out there more than if I didn’t have one. Now I can see all my stats. You can customize your screens for running. I changed the default of the first screen- time, pace, and distance. To current pace, distance, average pace. I don’t care how long I’ve been out there. When I run in the woods, it’s not as accurate. But I think that might be gps and not the actual watch. But other more expensive Garmins, have trail running activities. This one is more simple, but I love it. I can only get about 50 miles at 1 time before the battery dies. Otherwise about 9 days I think without gps mode. Def get you a running watch if you are thinking of it. You can save all your runs to the Garmin app. It shows new records as you complete every run. Fastest mile, 5k, half M, full M, 50k, longest run.

  I am a legit customer of Garmin and I had high hopes for this product, but it failed my expectations.So the first few months of having this product were great. I got up and off the couch and started running 15 miles a week because of this thing. So if you run with it, you're going to need to wash your device every workout or it will cause some irritation to the skin. So naturally the easiest way to make sure the sensor is clean to your wrist, is to take a shower with the watch on. So I have been and then one day, just like that, stopped working 10 min after the shower. Ive given it several days to fully dry and try to charge it again. NOTHING!! I am very upset with the fact that it broke that easily and there weren't even any scratches or cracks in the glass. Also be careful with the wrist strap, Can easily snap if pulled wrong.Overall, I really thought the heart rate monitor, the gps tracker, and other features work quite well. If you're a beginning athlete or just run for fun/casually then this is the device for you. More serious athletes should consider spending more money on a more expensive garmin, its worth the price. I hope Garmin reads this comment and messages me back about how i can get a refund or if i can replace my malfunctioning product for one that works.

  This is the second Forerunner 35 I've purchased. The first lasted about 18 months before going belly up with a blank screen. First the good. I graduated to this from a Garmin vivofit, so the addition of the GPS was awesome. Second, the price when purchased wasn't unreasonable ($130). I like the size of the face, the feeling on my wrist - in short it does everything I want/need it to do. Now the bad. The first watch, for the last 9 months that I had it was really bad about losing its bluetooth connection. Every few days - sometimes every day - I'd have to forget the device and pair it again. A pain in the rear but I got used to it. This latest issue, where the screen went blank, appears to be a loose connection, likely with the charging leads or battery. I can tap the watch and get the face to come back and the screen will alternate between fully charged and no charge. Why buy a second one? I like it and I'm used to it. Would give it a higher rating if it were more reliable.Update: The third Forerunner 35 has stopped keeping accurate time. It loses 6-7 minutes per hour. This started occurring 14 months after purchase. I've done resets, return to factory settings, etc., all to no avail. It's a shame Garmin can't or chooses not to build a unit that lasts a bit longer.

  It's a great watch. I have owned it for 3 months now. Battery life lasted a little longer than 10 days after the first full charge. It's easy to conserve the battery though- just turn the power off if you don't need to use the watch; it takes about 5 seconds to start up once you turn it back on. I have yet to be able to control music and look at weather from the watch. Other than that, the watch operates as advertised.Update: After 8 months, I swam (recreationally) with the watch in 5 ft of water with some friends and after the watch would not turn on. The battery apparently died, although it had 2 bars  before I swam. The charger now has a trip or something where it is not sufficiently charging the watch. This confuses me since I hardly ever move the charger from the same spot even when charging the watch. Also, I actually managed to use the music function! It only allows me to control Pandora on my Samsung S5, which sucks because I'd like to use Spotify, but it's great if you use Pandora or like to listen to a certain Pandora station when running or something. Still no luck with the weather, but it may be a problem with my phone location services not the watch? I'll probably buy a new charger later and see if that helps anything. So for not, the only thing that's been a problem after about 8 months is the battery and/or the charger.Update Dec 2017: I got a new watch for no cost at at other than shipping, as it was still under warranty. It works great! The weather works consistently. The music feature is functional as well with Spotify. You just have to pick your default music player on the app.

  I have had a Forerunner 405 for a long time and buy them up from EBAY over the years when the battery goes dead or the wristband breaks. CANNOT buy a wristband anymore so I went to the 35.I like the face very easy to read in ANY light. The band is super soft and I hope it lasts.My Forerunner 405 would let me stop and start to accumulate a full day of walking usually 12-13 miles. The 35 must be saved each time so I have 4-5 entries a day. The heart rate is not to accurate. The GPS is great.I also wear a Fitbit and use the Garmin to capture only my walking miles.Also, if you use a PC or Laptop and use Garmin Connect the USB module won't work. You have to use the charging cable connect to a USB port to update. Both Garmin and Fitbit abandoned the PC users and assumed we all have and constantly use a Smartphone which we carry all the time. Not true if you are retired or don't need a smartphone?Also, even with a Bluetooth connection with the 35 and my laptop it won't update.Garmin makes some great products I have been using them over 20 years.

    Great choice for a fitness tracker.

  This was my first fitness tracker/watch. I've had it for 3 months.  I normally don't wear a watch so it took awhile to get used to it, but I found the band to be comfortable.  I wore it almost non stop for a couple weeks until I scratched the face at work (mechanic). I bought a screen protector for it and relegated it to weekend wear and while working out.  The battery life is great, easily lasting more than a week of continuous wear, and about a month of intermittent.  It seems to track accurately and update quickly to changes in speed and direction.  I use it for cycling, jogging and even  double checking the speedometer in the car.  Over all I'm quite happy with it and it was a great price on black Friday.

  I am really enjoying this watch as well as the app that goes with it. It accurately did an outdoor hike as well as indoor runs - very happy with the accuracy! The heart rate monitor is accurate. The charge lasts for days I charge once or twice a week and wear it almost constantly. The notifications/Bluetooth on it works really well. Overall I highly recommend this watch. I am an avid exerciser and hiker (6 days a week) and love it.

  This watch is amazing. I feel like it’s the best bang for your buck you can find. Gps works well and heart rate. The sleep tracker is off once and a blue moon, but it does the job well. The watch connects to a fun app too. Would recommend this one over the more expensive Garmin watcheS. This is because it has all the necessary features for a competitive runner. The new ones has fancy features that don’t really actually make you faster... plus the accuracy on those is questionable. Like if you want your threshold, you use a machine to take your blood not a watch. If you want v02, you need to actually get tested in a lab, not use a watch. You get my point. Those features are not effective, making them borderline pointless.

    Poor interface. Lacks features.
  
",3.0,mw,"Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  The Forerunner 35 is usable for running, but I have a few nits. It has a square shape with buttons directly across from each other. Pushing a button requires holding it with both thumb and forefinger, making it easy to push the button on the wrong side if you aren't careful with finger placement. While running there are six customizable data fields divided between two screens, which you can scroll between. But, there are no labels on the data fields, so you have to remember what they're set to, and also what screen you are on. Why not have labels in a small font, as it does elsewhere in the interface? I dislike the number of button presses it takes to do basic things. Starting a run takes a minimum of four button presses, more if you don't want the default options. Stopping a run takes five button presses, which includes two to turn off the unit. To turn off you first have to hold the power button five seconds. Okay, that prevents you from turning it off accidentally -- but why does it then also ask you to select yes or no to actually turn off?The only GPS feature is distance tracking. I would have liked to at least have elevation.

    Cannot set treadmill stride length
  
",4.0,carla mchenry,"Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2021","









  
  
    
  One important thing this watch does NOT allow is manually setting stride length for treadmill runs.  There is a setting on the app and web interface but that only affects walking stride, which is odd because if it is counting steps inside your work place for example, your stride is not even close to uniform.  The one place you need to set your stride manually would be an indoor run or treadmill use.  The watch normally uses GPS tracking and step count to determine your stride. If you buy this and use it say in the winter, before the watch has a chance to rack up a few outdoor runs using GPS, you are stuck with a preset stride.  This makes every run on my treadmill over report by quite a distance.  A 5k run should be 3.1 miles. The run as measured on my Nordic Track treadmill says 3.1 but the watch will report about 3.8 miles.  That's a significant mismatch.Dear Garmin, please see if this can be addressed.  I know this model is likely already obsolete but it would be a nice gesture.

  I purchased this watch for my mom so that we could compare workouts and be ""Garmin Friends"".I absolutely would recommend this watch to ""beginner"" or ""Average"" runners/bikers.My mom primarily bikes and we have found that this watch is more accurate than her Apple Watch.We like how easily the screen displays bike ride analytics as she is in the middle of a workout.This watch seems to last a long time on a single charge, even while in GPS mode. Much better than the other ""smart watch"" she currently has.This is the most reasonably priced watch with GPS integration and a wrist heart rate monitor I found. I am pleased with the purchase of this watch. I believe she will probably use this for 2-3 years before we decide to ""upgrade"" to a higher model of Garmin with more ""features"".

    Band falls off, would only recommend for casual runners
  
",3.0,Allison,"Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  This watch does all the functions you need it to. I haven't had any issues linking to Strava and it tracks my workout information fairly well when I'm inside. Where I have noticed the downfall is the GPS. I recently did a run in the mountains and it took quite a bit of time to get a signal and my route make came out wonky. When I tried it again for a hike later in the day, it seemed to figure it out. I don't know if that was due to me being at a higher elevation or it adjusting to the extra obstacles.The one major complaint I have about this watch is the band. Both sides have fallen off and needed to be replaced at this point. The adhesive on the watch doesn't seem to be hardy at all. Thankfully it hasn't fallen off during a run or when I wouldn't notice it. Reaching straight out to Garmin fixed the issue and they were able to send me a new band.I would recommend this for a more casual runner. I can imagine how these issues would be annoying for anyone training for something huge.

  The worst garmin I had... keeps on turning off on long runs even when blutooth and alerts are off. It ruins my monitoring. I had 305. It is still working and had more stuff I need. If not for sync up problem with garmin express, I will not buy this crappy product. I was disappointed. I used it 4 times on 8 and 10 mile run. It turns off at unpredictable mileage, like after 2, or 4, or 6 miles. And nothing is saved of course. Don’t buy this.

  The watch is great, it's everything that I expected. I bought this to have something that could track my pace and distance and it does just that. The design and material is very high quality, which leads me to my next point, the fit of the rubber wrist strap is very durable and fits my wrist like a glove, and I have pretty small wrists. Definitely would recommend this product to anyone looking for a watch to go on runs with.

    Good for light data tracking
  
",5.0,Edward Martinez,"Reviewed in the United States August 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  TLDR: Good for few-whistles, basic data tracking (miles and time) with some new perks. If you want high-fidelity data or activity tracking, programmable workouts, integration with other devices/apps, I suggest youPurchased this about 3 months ago (May 2020) primarily to track distance/speed for running (M, ~160 lbs, ~20 miles/week). Previously spent about 7 years with the Forerunner 205 and Forerunner 15. This is basically the Forerunner 15 with some added activity tracking (wrist HR monitoring, cardio, etc.) and a much trendier look. I bought this to replace my FR15 and they are almost the same price even after all these years. I suspect the wrist HR monitoring and visual overhaul are responsible for the relative price hike; unfortunately both are features I didn't particularly care for.  On the first use or two, it took some time to acquire satellites (>3 min) , but after that it routinely is ready to go after ~30s (even from inside my apt). I imagine if you travel long distances, it will go take a while to acquire satellites again.While running, the primary display contains time and distance which is really all I personally care about. Other screens contain instantaneous pace, calories burned, HR, etc. I've personally never found the real-time pace indication to be particularly, even on the slightly higher end FR205.Heart rate has also been inconsistent: when I'm just sitting on my couch it indicated HRs of over 120, and when I've been gasping for breath mid-workout, it's indicated my HR was <50. HR tracking via wrists is not an easy task, and I haven't tried more popular activity trackers so I can't speak to the relative accuracy. The manual includes instructions on how to properly place the the watch on your wrist, which I followed but to no avail. After about 2 months with the watch, HR does seem to have dialed in a little better, but still has a great deal of variance. If you're really into accurate data collection, you're probably better off with a dedicated fitness tracker or a more expensive model as the step counter feature isn't particularly great either.As far as GPS quality goes, it seems to be fairly reliable. Compared to manually mapping my runs, this comes reasonably close. With all the Forerunner models I've found that the fewer turns you take, the more accurate the GPS tracking is. Can't speak for the accuracy during swimming or biking. I did have the GPS go haywire (> 25% error on the total run distance) on one run during the first week, which worried me a bit. Seems like it was an isolated incident as it has not occurred since and I've had that occasionally happen with the other models.In all, perfect for my use with the added benefit of being more flashy and with a few new features. I could have done without the fitbit cross-over redesign, but it ain't bad. Worried about the glass screen not being as durable, but time will tell. If you want higher accuracy or more control over your data and workouts, go with a higher end watch. This a decent mix of capability and cost if you want all you want is to track time and miles without having to bring your phone along.

    Love not needing to wear a band around my stomach
  
",5.0,C.J.,"Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2017","









  
  
    
  *UPDATE 2: Have been using for almost a full year now. Still works like new. Use it 3-5 times a week on runs and occasionally wear it as an everyday watch. My boyfriend just got his own Forerunner 35 for Christmas and he loves his too.*UPDATE: Have been using this almost daily for almost 5 months. Still in great condition and working order. Has withstood snow, rain, sweat, and repeated taking on and taking off.ORIGINAL REVIEW: I bought this because I had been using the smart-phone app ""Runkeeper"" to track my runs,  but needed a run-tracking device that didn't use up phone data/battery as I'm increasing my distance. This fit the bill.I've taken this watch on a few runs now, ranging from 3-10 miles. On each run its accurately tracked my run - the GPS never seemed to lose signal.  I ran familiar routes so I could compare them with the GPS tracking on my smartphone and they match up, so this tells me the GPS is accurate.Pros:-Accurate GPS tracking-Battery life (worked all day as a regular watch with activity tracking turned off, and also worked on my semi-long runs no problem).-Heart rate monitor on wrist. Love not needing to wear a band around my stomach.-Pairs with the Garmin Connect app on my laptop and phone.- Color! Love it!Cons:-Maybe not a con but I wonder about the durability/longevity of the wristband. Time will tell.For me the Forerunner 35 is worth the $200 I paid for it. Its all I need and don't see a reason for spending money on the newer, more expensive Forerunners.

    Sleep tracking has a major problem
  
",3.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  The sleep tracking is fairly accurate, if you get all your sleep in one solid block.  However, if you get up at night for any length of time before going back to sleep, it quits tracking.  If you rely on a long nap to supplement your nightly sleep, it will never track those one or two blessed afternoon hours.  I even tried defining my “bedtime” as 22 hours, and it still couldn’t see these sleep episodes.  So it vastly undercounts my sleep.Fitbit’s inexpensive watches CAN track almost all the sleep you get.  I went away from Fitbit since their watches don’t seem as durable as the Garmin.  But since sleep-tracking is my major need, I’m having second thoughts.  I keep thinking Garmin will update their software to improve sleep-tracking, but no luck so far (12/5/20).  If they do, I’ll update this review.

  Usually, anyway. As many know, the optical HR monitor is less accurate than one using a strap. However, you would still figure it to be somewhere in the ball park, and it often is. A little less often, it ins't. Sometimes it will record a run at 190 beats per minute which is 10 beats over my measured max. I could not reach that level, let alone hold it for 5+ miles.The sleep is interesting, but I doubt its accuracy too. It can mistake reading a book in bed for light sleep. It can miss waking up for short periods too.The Garmin Connect app (I use it on my Mac) cannot delete inaccurate information. You can delete or edit an inaccurately measured activity, such as a run, but all the insane heart rate reading remains, distorting all averages and the crude guess at VO2 max. Some of the supposed function of the 35 have never been measured in spite of all the criteria set by Garmin being met, For example, ""Training Status.""  The Users Manual is of little help here, as all it say is if you do a, b, and c, it SHOULD read. Great. What if it doesn't? No advice on what to do.It is reasonably cheap though, and seems to do sorta OK most of the time. I'd say is is mostly a way to get a crude idea of a variety of information. Unfortunately, I find that information unreliable, so what s the point?

  Deeply disappointed with the Forerunner 35.  First let me say I am current on firmware updates.  I bought this as a low cost replacement for my 225 which I liked a lot ..until the HRM failed after about two years - apparently a well known issue.  Initially the FR35 did the job - not as attractive as the 225 but gave me what I needed,  However crazy results started showing up - recovery pace was slightly faster than my 5k pace !  Final straw today - 2 minutes differential between contiguous miles in a marathon !  Not helpful.  Looking at the generated map on Garminconnect shows me with a half mile on either side of the course and running on water for about three miles.  Granted there was tree and cloud cover but even my old FR305 was able to cope with the same course and conditions a few years ago.  With failure after two years (FR235) and watch that sends me news alerts but is unable to reliably report lap pace I am pretty disillusioned with recent Garmin products.

  Very happy with this device. I had a GPS some years ago but it was so complicated it would seem like I'd spend more getting the settings right than actually running. All I need is to know how far I went, time and pace. This is perfect, so easy to use, picks up the GPS signal in seconds and a nice big and clear display. Fun dashboard on the computer. Love it!

  This watch does exactly what I wanted it to do, which is track mileage and speed. And it’s numbers are large enough for my middle-aged eyes to see while running. It was priced reasonably ($100). I’d recommend it to others who want a straightforward runners watch.

    Got it for heart rate, and that’s it’s only weak point...
  
",1.0,Brent Willard,"Reviewed in the United States October 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  Good battery life etc. but the main reason I bought it was to track heart rate during workout. It gets stuck randomly on a specific heart rate and unless you check it every few minutes or readjust the strap on your wrist, it won’t fix itself. I have had it for just a couple weeks before this started happening. I only wear it 1hr per day max. Never dropped it or exposed to water or extreme shock/heat. Amazon support said I need to contact manufacturer directly and didn’t help me out at all...

  Many days I woke up with having 150-400 steps counted on my watch.  I may be a restless sleeper, but that's ridiculous therefore I don't have any confidence that it's accurate. Most of my friends that own a ""sport watch"" say that the step counters aren't accurate so Garmin may be as good as the other watches.  About 6 weeks of owning the watch, I woke up one morning and the watch said it was Sunday at 10:00 AM and that happened on a Wednesday (I had about 50% charge left on the phone).I called customer support a few times and they were very friendly and willing to help.

    I can't even describe my disappointment with this watch
  
",2.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2018","









  
  
    
  I can't even describe my disappointment with this watch. I read all the reviews and I had hope that the Garmin had improved since 2012 when I got my last watch from them, that the satellite syncing wouldn't take so long like it used to. Everyone I know who has a Garmin said that it's super fast. I must have got a lemon because mine takes anywhere between 3 to 5 minutes to sync. I contacted Garmin, who I had been told have excellent customer service, and their recommendation was to sync my watch with my phone every day. I tried that. It did help a little, but I shouldn't have to do that to get it to sync to satellites. I also shouldn't have to do that every day! I live on a small island, it's not like I'm moving very far from the last location I ran from each time I use this. I don't understand why the satellite syncing feature would have to be updated on a daily basis with my phone. I was not impressed with the advice and the blase and uncaring from the person I spoke to.It also takes a long time to sync to my phone (Garmin agreed that this is unusual), as it can take up to 5 minutes. Which is annoying, I have better things to do with my time than babysit my watch syncing.I can walk around my bedroom for a few minutes and it doesn't notice I'm walking so even counting steps isn't so accurate. I've been walking down the street looking at the step counter and seeing it not register my movement.Overall a huge disappointment. When it works, it's great, but honestly, Map My Fitness on my phone is quicker and easier. I can turn it on and within 10 seconds I can go. If I was trying to use this watch for a race, I'd miss the start because I'd be waiting for it to sync. Or it might start in time. It's so hit and miss it's hard to tell.One positive is that it does have a pretty band and I think the heart rate monitor is accurate but I don't know for sure as I've nothing to test it against. Another positive is that the interval timer on it is pretty good and very useful.Distances I'm not sure who's being inaccurate but my phone and my watch get different distances even though one is in my right hand and the other on my left wrist. I'm told that that can be fixed with doing something in the settings but I haven't bothered trying as I've ceased using this for anything but a step counter (even if it is inaccurate).I hate leaving negative reviews but I can't even begin to describe how disappointed I am with this watch and Garmins response to my complaint (I only contacted them the once as the person I spoke to was useless). Everyone else I know who has one (different models) find these watches amazing but this will be the last Garmin I buy unfortunately. Which is a shame.

    can't sweat while wearing it?!
  
",3.0,Very Picky Shopper,"Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2019","









  
  
    
  I researched these units for a month before selecting this one- I really wanted wrist-based heart rate most of all, with a large easy-to-read face, and not many other bells and whistles.  I want to be able to read the heart rate during workouts.  Well, it works fine while walking, etc. but when working out hard and sweating, the heart rate data is all over the place, says it is 98 when I'm panting, or sticks on a given HR when I'm changing intensity, etc.  What a bummer!!  This is the feature I want most.  Reading online, others seem to have this issue as well.  Garmin's website lists FAQs, including one about 'erratic heart rate data' and it suggests you wipe the sensor off while sweating.  How helpful.  How can this be functional in water if it can't even handle a little sweat?

  I like the display which is always on with a LCD and back-light for dark rooms.  I use the GPS mostly for biking, and on the water for kite boarding, with physical buttons, it is so easy to cycle thru the pages to see my progress or heart rate, among other features.  Another cool feature of a smart watch is, when I leave the room without my phone, the watch will notify me that it has lost the bluetooth connection because I'm out of range.  I immediately march back to get my phone.

    Not a good product as consumer report recommends!
  
",1.0,Green Land,"Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  After reading consumer report recommendation, I purchased this item from Amazon. It is a big disappointment. I have 3 major issue with it: 1) The accuracy: I am very concerned about heart rate when I do exercise. However, it gives me some info I really think it is false. When I do slow run, my heart rate normally around 110 . It shows me heart beat is too low. When I run faster, my heart beat normally 130, or more, it shows my heart beat is too high. My max heart rate should be around 150.  2) The GPS connection: when I first time used it, it connected satellite in a few second. After a couple of days, each time it takes 3~5 minutes to connect GPS. It is very frustrating. 3) The user's manual: there is lots of numbers showing on this watch without explanation or illustration in its manual. I really do not know what these numbers are for. For example, on manual page 3, the time 26:08, I understand it is the running time. But what is the number above it, and below that number. There is no explanation for it. You may have to guess. Sometimes, you never get it right. Generally, you spent around a hundred dollars, just buy a big disappointment!

  I did a lot of research before purchasing, I knew I wanted a GPS/run tracker as well as a step counter and HR monitor. There are fancier models out there but this does EXACTLY what I want and does it well. Takes a few seconds to establish GPS, also to realize pace changes, but I like the run modes feature, that I can pair it with food apps to watch calories in/out and control my phone's music and calls with the watch. Very pleased.

  Retired my old Garmin Forerunner 405 after I found that replacing the band was going to be silly expensive.  And using the Garmin ANT+ stick seemed outdated (and annoying).  My new Garmin 35 has been clicking along, locks satellites lickety-split, and does everything I want it to and about thirty things more.  Used for: running, hiking, and competitive sleep-tracking.

",4.0,Highland Horseman,"Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  UPDATE: After extended use the heart rate readings have become sporadically inaccurate - accurate some of the time, inaccurate the remainder.I have used this for walking and for a rowing machine.  I compared the heart rate output with a blood pressure and heart rate cuff I use and it is very comparable - if you place it correctly and snuggly.  It does seem to take a few minutes to become accurate.  When rowing I use the cardio mode and for walking I use the walking mode.  I prefer having buttons to push rather than an interactive screen.  The battery seems to last well - 4 rowing sessions and 2 walks before recharging, but then I power it off when not using because I don't routinely wear a watch.  For the price and functions I wanted this is 5 stars.  If it were to quit working within 1-2 years I would likely change to 2 stars.

First off....it ain't quite like the older Garmin Vivofit watch.PROS:>>Pretty easy to set up once you load the Garmin Connect App to your smartphone>>Measures all sorts of things [heartbeat, steps taken, rest stuff and so on]>>Even tells me the forecast and current temperature>>Nice feel watch band>>Looks decent enough but face is a bit smaller than expected>>Easy to read time [for those with fairly bad eyes]>>Night lite for a few seconds to see what time it is in low light conditionsCONS:>>NO touchscreen [that really surprised me a LOT & that seemed like a step backwards]>>Smallish watch face [thought the watch face would be at least as large as my prior Garmin watch was]>>Kind of hard to use at first [once you figure it out, it's fine]>>Odd way to charge the battery [using a clip attachment & not a magnetic charger like my prior Garmin...another step backwards I think]Overall, this Garmin Forerunner 35 is a decent enough watch for me and despite its few drawbacks, I will keep this watch as it's just minor issues and not bad enough for me to return.

  The Garmin forerunner 35 is a basic gps for tracking workouts, but it is not very accurate and is very limited in what it can do.Good:-Light weight-Easy to follow menus-Once it finds gps it stays connectedBad:-Takes forever to find gps signal.  Make sure you start it way before you want to start a workout.  It often goes into sleep mode because it takes so long.-It is very inaccurate in tracking distance.  I tested the 35 against two other higher end Garmins and the 35 was off by 1.3 miles after tracking for 19 miles.-You can't track elevation gain on the watch.  You can see it on the app.  To me this is really dumb.  All I care about is total distance, total time and total elevation gain.  That's all I want to see and know.  Why this can't be on the watch baffles me.-The elevation that the watch calculates after syncing with the app is way off.-The app is super intrusive and is always running in the background even if the watch is off.  All I want to do is sync my workouts so I can see all the details.  I ended up installing it on a tablet I rarely use because I didn't want the app on my phone.-The watch takes forever to sync with the app.  Sometimes it just gives up.  Super annoying.
