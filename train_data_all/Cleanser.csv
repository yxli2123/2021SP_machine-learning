  While it is very moisturizing and rinses well, it does not remove the slightest amount of makeup, which makes you wonder how clean it makes your face. Secondly, I might get a pimple once or twice a month, if at all. However, after using this for a week, many pimples popped up on my chin/around my mouth. I discontinued it and the acne went away. Because I love CeraVe's other products, I tried again after three weeks. Same thing happened. Broke out around my chin. My skin is normal. I was disappointed, especially as it is not cheap and I have to throw away the entire bottle.

  I absolutely LOVED this facial cleanser, it is super hydrating and also helps with acne. It doesn’t really have a scent to it though so if that matters to you, I wouldn’t get it. It’s also nice because a little bit of product goes a looong way. This bottle will last you a long time. Definitely nice for dry or normal to dry skin!

  It's one of the most suggested products around and that is why I purchased it. It's a great smooth cleanser and does it's job well. It's also a great deal price wise. The only issue I am encountering with this is that, upon squeezing the pump it spurts out straight at you instead of falling in your hand.

  My skin is extremely sensitive and prone to adult acne, especially mid-cycle, as well as turning brilliant shades of red when using many so-called gentle cleansers and lotions. My forehead flakes from dryness no matter how much moisturizer I use. I have tried Cetaphil and now CeraVe. I used CeraVe for a long time and was pretty pleased with the results until I found a new cleanser that was even better for my super sensitive skin type (Marcelle Ultra Gentle Cleansing Gel). I won't go back to CeraVe again, but it was cheaper than Marcelle.

  I originally bought this to use to remove my makeup thinking it would be emollient enough to break it down.  The mascara I use is the fiber/tubing kind that is removed with just water,  but I thought this would create some ""slip"" so that I wouldn't be tugging on my eye area too much (that's a no no at my age). It doesn't provide as much slip as I was hoping,  but it is better than nothing.  I think Cetaphil has more slip. After my mascara is removed from my lashes,  I lightly tissue it off. I used to then wet my face and massage 2 pumps onto the rest of my skin. Doing this, I noticed that it was not removing my makeup if I rinsed it off and it felt like it mixed with the makeup and created a film. I would tissue this off, then do a second cleanse with a foaming wash like the Cerave foaming cleanser or Dove bar to get the residue off. What i have learned is to massage this on DRY skin.  This seems to make it more effective in removing makeup.  I am then able to rinse it off. I still do a second cleanse, but I would do this anyway because I also use my Clarsonic during this stage. On days that i don't wear makeup,  I will use just this to wash my face (I wet it with water first because I am not removing long wear makeup) and not do a second wash.  I do feel that it keeps my face soft after using it. I wish it was more smooth when massaging it onto the skin,  but I can feel that it is adding a layer of moisture/barrier on my skin.  I have oily skin, but I could definitely see this helping keep drier skin more moisturized.

  Try this out. Dermatologists recommend it for a reason. We have a tendency to want to go for things that look fancy or for the products in Sephora or Ulta or the Department stores. Trust me I'm guilty as well. But, not when it comes to my skin care. When it comes to skincare I lean more towards the recommendations of dermatologists and estheticians. I've received more ""drugstore"" recommendations than anything and CeraVe comes HIGHLY recommended!

  I've used the Cerave Hydrating Face Wash for a month now and it's really helped clear my skin up along with a few other products. It really helps clean make up and dirt off your face. When it goes over your lips it feels a little bit like chapstick as well. That's how hydrating it is. Another plus is that it smells like nothing. So if your skin is anything like mine and can't handle scented products - this is for you!However, because I have very sensitive skin and it has left a few whiteheads every now and then but nothing that was too crazy or couldn't be taken care of. I think it can be a hit or miss with people but it worked well for my very dry skin.

  I like how detailed the instructions are.  They tell you the water should be lukewarm, put a little on your face first, and rub in circles away from your eyes. I just ate a burger and washed my face after when I feel very greasy.  This made my skin feel so much better. I noticed my lips were chapped after and I needed chap stick, so maybe this isn't 100% top scorer on moisturizing.  Just use moisturizer and chap stick and it's fine.  I won't know for a while if this helps fix my skin irritation problems.

  I don’t normally spend time writing reviews, but I felt others should be warned.After reading similar reviews, I decided to try this product. I felt the complaints about the product not actually cleansing might by biased by people with higher standards than I.I was wrong.There is something very off with this product. It smells and feels normal, but as soon as you apply it to your face, some kind of weird oily residue seeps down- I can feel it on my lips every time. After washing away the product, there is still oil left to the touch in the t-zone (and I do not have excessively oily skin). I tried using the product multiple washes and multiple times- same effect.It’s ridiculous when you have to wash your face with *another* cleanser because this one doesn’t work.Im switching back to the regular cerave. Avoid the hydrating one at all costs.

  When I was younger, I had oily skin. Now that I'm older it's more dry, but I still get some pimples. I also have VERY sensitive skin, especially on my face. This is the best cleanser that I've ever used. I wash my face two times before bed, using a microfiber cloth. The first time gets off most all of the makeup, but I wash it one more time just to make sure. (I use full coverage foundation and concealer.) Honestly, I have really good intentions to use moisturizer, but I skip it most of the time. This cleanser is enough.Once I accidentally purchased their other cleanser that is formulated for oily skin, but I broke out. I think it may have over-dried my skin, and my skin over compensated. I went back to this, and it cleared right up.CeraVe is a great company, and I really like almost everything I've used of theirs: sunscreen, moisturizer, lotion. (I tried them first when my dermatologist recommended them.)Compared to a lot of other beauty cleansers, you can't beat the price. This, like all CeraVe products, is fragrance free, since fragrances tend to irritate sensitive skin. I don't notice any smell at all.If you are thinking about trying it, I would recommend.

  Generally, I like this line!  However, when I used this cleanser, it stung my skin.  I thought that it might have been a fluke or a negative reaction to some makeup residue, but the second time it stung worse.  Then, after reader by the ingredients more carefully, I discovered that this cleanser contains alcohol!  Furthermore, most products which are gels, of which ch this is one, contain alcohol, which has a dehydrated by effect on skin, while the marketing often promotes the product as preferred for dry, sensitivity be skin since it glides on so easily!  I now avoid all gels, as well as any other product containing alcohol, for use on my face, neck or décolleté, and I encourage others with dry, sensitive skin of any age, to do the same.

It also caused my face to have minor breakouts too. I've tried other CeraVe cleansers, e.g. Renewing SA cleanser, that one cleans a bit too well, and it makes my face feels a bit tight after use. I've also tried the Foaming Facial Cleanser, that one I think works the best. It foams really well, feels clean, but doesn't make my face feel tight.Overall, I would rank Foaming Facial Cleanser the best > Renewing SA cleanser >> CeraVe Hydrating face wash.It's just a really bad formula, don't waste your money on this.

  Certainly doesn't irritate, but I never felt like I got fully clean, or like it fully rinsed off. If it got on my lips at all, it left a filmy, oily sensation that drove me up a wall. As a skincare junkie, I hate myself for saying it, but I preferred the Glossier cleanser to this (hides head in hands).If you need something super gentle and aren't really looking to get *super-clean* (say, an AM cleanse), this could do. The ingredients list is impeccable, but it just didn't do anything helpful for me.

  I’ve been using this cleanser for a few weeks now. Because I have oily skin, I used to avoid overly hydrating skin care products. Turns out that was a mistake.....for me.Now that I’m treating my skin in a more gentle manner, my oil production has significantly decreased, and my overall skin health is much much better. I didn’t realize how dehydrated my skin actually was due to all the oil I was producing. I don’t think my skin has ever been this healthy now that I’m using the CeraVe cleanser and moisturizer. I’m WAY less oily now!

  I didn't read the reviews closely enough before I purchased it. I use CeraVe face moisturizer and like it. This face wash feels like I'm washing my face with the moisturizer. It feels like lotion as you wash. There is no lather, just lotion. After trying it out I read the comments more closely and I see that others have said the same thing. That's my fault. I ordered the foaming face wash by CeraVe and I like it much better. Just be aware that it doesn't lather, foam or feel any different than washing your face with lotion before you buy.

  I wrote the review below upon receiving my first bottle, I did notice the review about a suspiciously untrademarked bottle but mine was fine. Now I have my second bottle and it is suspect (left in pics). I just used this and my face is tingling unlike when I used my old bottle earlier today. The product felt thinner, which prompted me to inspect the bottle and I'm not so sure anymore. This is why I barely order anything from Amazon anymore....I've been figuring out a routine to help my dry acne-prone skin out over the past 6 months, and this cleanser has  turned out to be the final missing piece.  It's perfect for daily morning/night because it doesn't strip too much away.  It is definitely not for removing significant makeup, but is a great follow-up post makeup removal.  This has helped clear any remaining dry spots and scars from my face-- Love it.

",5.0,mygirls2x,"Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2021","









  
  
    
  I'm a 19 year old girl with pretty oily skin. I struggled with any form of acne you could think of. I tried numerous dermatologists, different face washes, toners, diets, nothing seemed to work. I'm athletic and eat healthy so I knew there was something more than myself. I used to use Neutrogena Grapefruit face wash everyday day and night for almost two years. I then started looking into it and realized how harmful and harsh the products were in it. For how oily my skin was, I always thought ""well why would I ever want to moistorize to add to the oil"". Yes, I saw a skin care guy who got blown up on tiktok named 'SkinbyHyram' and when I tell you this man saved my skin, I was amazed. I thought that I needed the harder chemicals out there to kill all my acne when really, I was killing my own skin. He recommended CeraVe face wash AND the blue CeraVe moisturizer . The moisturizer is a must as well. I started doing this day and night and after a month, my skin was so clear. Yes I get the occasional zit here and there but nothing nearly to waking up everyday to a few. The simpler you are your skin, the better it can heal it self. *disclaimer: not all skins are the same so sometimes the chemicals is what you need but from personal experience, the harsher the chemical the worse my acne got* One last tip: change your pillowcases!! So much dirt and oil are on them that you don't even know. I exchange or wash mine at least 2-3 times a week.

",4.0,Jin ,"Reviewed in the United States July 12, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased this product because I was tired of my face drying out after face washes. I compared this product with the alternative Foaming Facial Cleanser prior to purchasing. I didn't purchase the foaming version because I heard that those actually cause your skin to become dry after wash.Pro:-The facewash is easy on the skin and does not foam up AT ALL. This is great for sensitive skins, but hard to get used to at first.-The pumping feature is great because I can consistently control the amount of the product every time I use it. Two pumps of the facewash are ideal for me-No artificial fragranceCon:-As I mentioned, this product does not foam up at all, and the consistency is sort of like gel/lotion. This was hard to get used to at first because it felt kind of gross. If you cannot get over the this fact then do not purchase.Overall this is a great face wash, no smell, no foam, but cleans your skin in a gentle manner. Highly recommend if you have dry or sensitive skin!

It goes on super easy and washes off clean. While I think my skin feels clean afterwards it's so gentle I'm just not sure (this is probably a good thing). Have not used this long enough to determine if it's too gentle or the lack of anti acne ingredient will lead to worse skin or not. But in terms of usability it's great so far.

  This wash is definitely worth a try. I know you're going to see some reviews such as it not feeling like it's cleansing or leaving you too oily but understand this, hydrating facial washes are better for those who have dry dehydrated skin AND those who live in dry heat environments. I just moved from Virginia to California and needed a new wash because Cetaphil wasn't making the cut for the sudden change. No, I didn't experience a burning sensation using this wash which was also noted in some reviews, and I'm someone with very sensitive skin. The company selling this is directly CeraVe, you're getting it straight from the manufacturer so even if the bottling is off I would give them a little credit. This soap is a milky non-lathering solution that looks like watery lotion, but leaves your face feeling soft and refreshed after a wash. Do your research on what kind of facial cleanser your skin needs before buying, if you're looking for hydration then you're in the right place.

On to finding my next face cleanser now, because this brand has officially dissuaded me into buying their products anymore!

    Great for sensitive skin

  So far so good! I have pretty sensitive skin and waste a lot of money on buying things that hurt my skin and have to give away or throw out. I easily get a rash from products thay do not agree witj my skin. I have used Dermologica face cleanser and I love it, but it is so expensive. I would say this is comparable and 1/8 the cost. It is not drying, is either not scented or lighrly scented ( which I perfer), is mositizong, feels good going on and my skin feels good. I have been using it for about a week. I read a few diffrent articles about good gentle face washes and this came up everytime. I will have to see how my skin looks in a few weeks to dertimibe how useful it is for how my skin looks.

    Multi product review after wine drunk shopping
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States June 3, 2019","









  
  
    
  Story time!!  I'm 30 years old and I've always had dry skin, prone to stretch marks, slight translucent, and occasional karatosis Pilaris (red, hard bumps, looks like mild acne on arms, chest, back, and butt, leg's) . As a teen I never wore shorts because it was embarrassing not to have soft legs. They didn't look bad, they just were kinda matte even with lotion. Recently I bought Cerave body wash and lotion at the store. My skin looked better, felt better, was so soft and normal. My bumps are gone. After a few glasses of wine I got on Amazon and ordered a bunch of Cerave products to try them out. I got the bar soap, face wash, bumpy skin lotion, bumpy body wash, the dark blue container for extremely dry skin, the pump jar, the day and night cream, and the vitamin C serum. Sober me was happy to see all of these products today. I took a shower and tried different ones and I love them all!!!! No after shower itchy skin from hot water, everything is so soft, no itching or burning from these products. Honestly I've bought so much stuff to help me. Even Aveeno gave me dry skin. Lotion, oil, vaseline, homemade natural stuff whipped up in my kitchen, nothing worked. Just from what I got at the store my skin looked like everyone else's, but tonight it has that extra soft shine without being greasy. Products just soaked right in and my skin feel's comfortable. Some products go better on damp skin. The moisturizing face wash is great but I used it after using the bar soap to remove makeup. The moisturizing face wash doesn't foam up, so sometimes you'll need something extra, but it is super moisturizing. The bar soap is great you have to really work up a lather at first but it's so gentle, and moisturizing. I used it everywhere and when I got out of the shower I wasn't dry and itchy, and this is before lotioning!! Night cream over vita C serum feels so good, not greasy vita C serum is thin, night cream is not heavy, soaked in quick face is so soft. Hang tried the day cream yet, but will tomorrow. Go to the drug store and buy a small lotion, if you like it then I highly suggest trying other thing's, maybe before drinking a half bottle of Moscato. Since I bought so much stuff I'm posting the same comment on the other things I bought.

  I absolutely love this product! I spent so much money on expensive facewash and face creams and nothing worked like this. I always had breakouts on my chin and redness. No matter what products I used, it didn't fix my problem.  I bought this cleanse 2 weeks ago and use every day. I noticed my redness and pimples clearing up in 3 days! It leaves my skin smooth, healthy and clear. I just order another bottle in case they sell out. Cerave please never discontinue this product.

  This CeraVe is a rich lotion like cleanser. With Ceramides 1,3,6-11 hyaluronic acid and niacinamide. The label says that It is great for normal to very dry skin and that the benefits are to cleanse, hydrate and help restore the protective skin barrier. I can’t comment what results it will have to very dry skin but for normal to a little oily in the T zone, this cleanser is amazing and the creamy texture feels nice on the skin. It takes off all my makeup and leaves my skin feeling hydrated and not dry like other cleansers. I love that I can use it on my eyes to take off my mascara. I am hesitant to use other cleansers on my eyes but this one is creamy enough not to do damage to my lashes. I love it.

    To gentle to clean makeup off your face. Have to wash several times.
  
",1.0,Karen C.,"Reviewed in the United States November 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  At first it seems very good for dry skin. Maybe it is if you don’t wear makeup. I have to wash my face twice to get makeup off even scrubbing with a not so soft bristle facial brush. After that I still have to use toner to get the rest off. This is not waterproof hard to remove makeup either. This is the worst at cleaning your skin.After two washings the facial brush still had so much makeup on it. I washed the brush with this cleanser two more times and it was still stained with make up. That never happened with other cleansers. So I went to the kitchen got out my dawn dish soap and cleaned the brush for the third time. This time it was clean with white bristles again. I believe this face wash is more like washing with moisturizing lotion. Just doesn’t clean your face.

  I have used this two times and I can already notice a difference in the moisture in my skin. My skin on my face is very dry and red. This product has already helped lessen the redness as well. This face cleanser is NOT a lathering type. It is more of a lotion/moisturizer type. I really enjoy it though. It is also great for sensitive skin like mine. It has not caused any irritation. It is also fragrant free, or at least I couldn't smell really anything. I would highly recommend this Face Wash. Remember though this is not a makeup remover. I would remove your makeup first then go back in and wash your face with this.

  Cleanses well but gently. Love that this cleanser allows me to gently massage my face clean without creating friction or dragging on my face. What I didn't like, and wasn't expecting was the fact that this cleanser is non foaming. There is no lather. This isnt really a bad thing, but nowhere on the packing, or the item description did I see anything about this being a non foaming cleanser. Despite this, it cleanses well, and does not over dry or irritate my skin. I have tried other cleansers that did both. I have oily skin, and wear sunscreen, daily. This cleanser gets my skin clean.  I use this cleanser every other day, alternating with the CeraVe SA cleanser, (which does foam). This cleanser allows me to give my skin a gentle break from active ingredients. (which I use with the SA cleanser).  I use this cleanser on my face and neck and follow with a toner, an unscented centella gel from Purito, and follow up with my FAB barriair cream to help maintain my skin barrier.I bought this cleanser after a horrible bought of breakouts, from over cleansing and over exfoliating my skin. This cleanser along with the other steps above has helped me calm and heal my skin. The dark spots that resulted from my breakouts are still fading, but this cleanser is helping with my overall skin health.

  Gentle, non-stripping, effective. My derm recommended while using Trentoin (prescription retinol). The only issue I had with this is that it stings at times quite a bit upon application. It seems to depend on what cleanser I use prior to the CeraVe, because I usually double cleanse, first with an oil based cleanser, then with a basic cleanser after. It's enough to have made me not reach for it. When I first reviewed it, the bottle top was slightly unscrewed and had a very minor amount of product around the nozzle leaking out.

  This is one of the only products that I have not encountered a problem with! Usually for any skin care product it doesn’t work well or it causes me to break out even more. This product works great for my sensitive skin and it moistens my skin to perfection! It is also fragrance free so it’s not irritating in any way at all. It’s just apart of my daily routine and I love it.

    THE best for a nice double cleanse
  
",5.0,e_whospends_money,"Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  I have oily skin that I've been fighting with since college when my hormones decided to rebel against me and I got horrible acne for the first time in my life. Like most people, I tried to fight my oily skin with severely drying products that ultimately did nothing helpful for my face. Fast forward to 2019 with the bazillion articles about restoring moisture barriers and double cleansing and face oils - I now use this twice per day in the shower. Per another article, I massage this into my face with my fingers for a full 60 seconds to let the ingredients do their work, then rinse and follow with a sulfur soap on my oily zones that tend to break out. So far, so good! This leaves my skin feeling really soft and hydrated, and seems to get rid of all traces of my tinted sunscreen and any eye makeup that I wear. It's a ""cult favorite"" and I'm positive I'm not the first person to become a convert with the hydrating cleanser trend.

  I got this recently because I developed skin sensitivity on my cheeks with an eczema appearing rash, only flaring up when irritated but could be controlled. So I knew I wanted a fragrance free cleanser. This is a moisturizing face cleanser and does not in the least make my cheeks appear red, nor irritate. I will continue to use regularly in my cleansing routine, even once this passes. I've been satisfied with my cleansers but I think this also gives my skin a chance to destress and moisturize.

  I do not know what Amazon sent me but I don’t think this is actually Cerave. I’ve never used Cerave before but my skin also isn’t particularly sensitive and I can usually switch up my washes with no problem. After one wash, my skin was super red and bumpy on my chin. It’s like the first few layers of my skin have been raised and inflamed. I thought maybe it was just an initial fluke reaction, but after a second wash, the inflammation is now all over my cheeks as well as my chin. My skin has never EVER done this. It’s been hours and my skin is still inflamed. It’s not itchy, just red and hot and raised. Such a waste of money. Beware. Buy your skincare in an actual store.

  I haven't been using it for too long and I did breakout a little from this cleanser but I do with most new products. People seem to be concerned about the ® symbol not being on the bottle. Mine didn't come with the symbol but it's the same at my local store. It smells fragrance free and has a very different texture than most cleansers. It doesn't foam up at all but makes the skin soft. My only complaint is how it was packaged. It was packaged with no protection at all, no bubble wrap or anything. It still came in good condition but some people might not be as lucky.

    Better than my “gentle cleanser” from the other brand. Not drying.
  
",5.0,ErinD,"Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is my first time trying this cleanser and I really like it! It is not foaming and doesn’t dry out my face. Also no fragrance, which is a plus. I still need to apply moisturizer after cleansing, so I wouldn’t say this is “moisturizing”. I would just say it “isn’t drying” and rinses clean.I was previously using the cetaphil “gentle skin cleanser” (not their “facial cleanser”, which is a foaming wash.) When I first used this cerave product, my initial thought was “wow this is the exact same as my Cetaphil”.  However, upon further inspection I noted that they are not the same at all. The ingredients are quite different. Both products are non-foaming with no fragrance. Both are gentle-ish. They also look very similar. However, my Cetaphil is a bit runnier and has a slight pearly sheen to it Also, it’s just a bit drying and leaves a slight tight feeling on my face. This Cerave does not. Neither product will remove makeup. At all. I remove makeup before ANY cleanser, but these above mentioned products will not even BUDGE my makeup.This Cerave hydrating cleanser is a bit more money than my Cetaphil gentle cleanser for less product, but I can always wait for a sale or find a coupon and save a few bucks. In fact, I used a $2 Amazon coupon offer on this one. That said, a couple dollars more is worth it to me. I’ve found my new cleanser!

Then, at night I also use the CeraVe nighttime moisturizer that I absolutely swear by! It does amazing with my dermatitis control. When you use the products together, it all works perfectly together. The only moisturizer I can't use is the Spf sunscreen moisturizer, I have to use a mineral spf... I am allergic to some of the ingredients.  Also, very important to make sure to apply to damp skin, the reason why is because this moisturizing wash is thick and you want to work up a good lather to get a good wash to remove any extra dirt.I find it easier to use the foam wash with my Sonic Facial brush to get any dirt and to also exfoliate (twice a wk). But I use the regular brush replacement for a gentler wash morning & nighttime.  You don't want to damage your skin's moisture barrier  exfoliating every time you wash your face.CeraVe is great for dermatitis, psoriasis, eczema or any types of skin complications, ***but always consult with a dermatologist first***

  In my opinion, this is AWFUL! It leaves that terrible sticky chemical feeling. It burns when I use it. DO NOT let this anywhere near your eyes... you’re better off only washing below your eyes. Forget your forehead, unless you are looking to have blurry vision for a few minutes. My face wash that I normally use was on back order, so I made (to later find out) the poor decision to buy this because it had “good reviews” I’m starting to wonder if they were paid for...If you want your face to suddenly break out and be full of regrets... buy this product.If you’re looking for something positive about this product... the only I have is that it doesn’t really have a scent

  I’ve only been using this for three days (morning and night) and I love it already! Every other facewash I’ve ever tried leaves my face feeling parched. If I didn’t put lotion on instantly after washing, it would literally be flakey and dry. This hydrating cleanser leaves my face feeling soft and...plump?! I also purchased the Cerave Moisturizing Cream and have been applying it after washing my face, but honestly, I might not even need to use that every time because the cleanser leaves my face feeling so soft and moisturized! It also doesn’t leave an oily feeling. It all soaks into my skin!When I originally received the cleanser, the lid was not screwed on the bottle tightly and about half of the cleanser was out of the bottle, smooshed all over the inside of the bag it was in. I filled out the return-damaged link on MONDAY and the new (and intact) bottle was on my front step WEDNESDAY morning. I am very pleased! They also told me I didn’t need to return the damaged product, so I ended up with about half a bottle for free.

  I got this because the YouTube dermatologists recommended this. It does a good job of making the face look bright but I’ve gotten hives from using it. After using it for a couple days straight, it stripped the moisture from my face and caused it to burn while using it. The lotion also made my skin burn and my normally clear face started to flake and have hives all over my cheeks. I also got redness from both products, so I’m definitely having an allergic reaction of some sort. I’m disappointed. I wanted this to work out 😞

  The CeraVe cleanser has been my favorite for a few years now because it's so gentle, non-irritating, and keeps my skin from drying out. While it may not have any specialized benefits, it works well as a general hydrating facial cleanser. Just to be clear, this cleanser isn't meant to remove a full face of heavy makeup - it's meant to be a daily cleanser after makeup removal. Other cleansers have stripped my skin too much and have dried me out, but this one never does. It's really become the core of my skincare routine.

  Great product! It feels almost like a moisturizer that you’re trying to cleanse your face with. It doesn’t foam up, or leave your face feeling dry when you rinse it, which some people aren’t used to. Took me time. Because I’m used to the soapy fragrant face cleansers that literally wash away all the good stuff leaving your face feeling dry, which I associated with “clean.” Thank god I’m don’t with that!

  First let me say, this product does not claim to be a make-up remover.  Having said that, most would think that a product that says it is a ""facial cleanser"" would mean it actually cleans your face.  Unfortunately, I cannot claim that this product cleaned my face.I am a fan of CeraVe and have been using many products from this company for the past 8 months or so.  However, this ""facial cleanser"" did not do a good job of cleaning off my liquid foundation, which means it could not have my skin.  Instead, I had to use a facial cloth to wipe off the left over make-up and washed my face with another product.I have regularly used Clean & Clear's Daily Pore Face Cleanser and it cleans just about all of my make-up, if not all of it.  I never wipe off my make-up prior to washing my face and the C&C cleanser works great!Because I do not want to receive any strikes on my account, I will not be returning this product.  I will likely have my family use it until it is gone and will not reorder.  Good luck with whatever you choose to use.

  Okay, it’s says it’s  cerave but when I got it- it came without the sign and it smelled unusual. It didn’t smell like the one I usually have. Guess I’ll see the resultsEdit:Im still not 100% sure this is a legitimate product but I know for a fact that it did work a little. Over the weeks, I switched from the foaming cleanser to this cleanser day by day. I've noticed that sometimes when my blackheads start to fade away, and I put this on the next day, the blackheads would start to appear again. Another flaw is that it didn't have the reserved sign at one of the sides of the product. It only said CeraVe when it was supposed to say CeraVe with an r on the top. Yes, it helped my skin just the TINIEST bit, I'm still not proud of this product since there are MANY flaws with it. This product only helped my skin get smoother, nothing else. I wouldn't even say smoother since it would dry my skin and after I put on moisterizer and it ""goes away"" then my skin would start to feel softer than before. I wouldn't recommend buying this product so if your debating on buying this, I wouldn't. You should check out a different brand that Hyram recommends.

  I love this face wash. I have been struggling with adult acne the last couple of years, and each time I think I can fix it with the classic chemicals and drying products, my face ends up in a flare after a bit. This is the second time in a year I’ve been through that phase and gone back to this gentle and simple cleanser- I’ve learned simple is best! Especially if you have sensitive skin. Each time now it has began to slowly start healing my skin again. It does take time but your skin will thank you! My face is certainly not all the way clear but it is slow progress. Anywho, I will say that this does not take off my makeup whatsoever. I wear very light to no makeup, so I recommend pairing this with the makeup wipes and the moisturizer. Overall this is a great product and comes through every time over all these other expensive and harsh acne treatment products!

  I have dry, extremely sensitive skin. I bought this cleanser on a whim, and it’s the best one I’ve ever used! I’m shocked by all of the negative reviews.To be specific, this cleanser does not lather like soap. It reminds me a lot of how primer from Bare Minerals feels. It’s silky smooth! I use one pump, and rub it all over my face for about a minute. I’ve never had an issue with it not removing my makeup! I mean, waterproof mascara needs a little extra help coming off. But regular foundation, eye shadow, etc comes off just fine. I used to not be able to wash my face multiple times a day for fear of my skin drying out. Now I can wash my face as often as I want and I never dry out. I feel like this cleanser really does “restore the skin barrier”.Not every beauty product works for everyone. But I had to leave a positive review for this product I love so much! I look forward to washing my face now, and it’s helped me to stick to my skin care routine.

  I've been seeing reviews about this product being fake from Amazon so I guess they gave me a fake product instead of the real Cera Ve. I do not have sensitive skin and it burned after using it and made some burn marks and very raw red marks on my skin. Also, it made my skin completely dry! So dry that my skin is flaking off and very rough to the touch. I used nothing but Cera Ve on my face for a couple of days and it did that. Do NOT buy this product from Amazon since there is a bunch of people, including me having bad experiences from this product.

  This cleanser works great for me. I’m 65 and get horrible hormonal acne on my jaw line. I can’t use face cleansers for acne because I have dry skin and acne cleansers dry my skin even more. I love using this cleanser. It cleans my face very well. I know some others have left reviews saying it doesn’t clean well and doesn’t get their makeup off, but it cleans for me. I use toner after washing my face and I have never had any remaining residue show up on my cotton pad. This also leaves my face feeling really soft. I have not had a problem with my face being dry since I started using this. And, it has helped to clear out my pores and lessen the hormonal acne. It took a little getting used to because it doesn’t foam/suds up, but I got used to that very quickly. I am very happy with this cleanser.

    Beware: Formulation Changes
  
",2.0,Will G,"Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  I need to preface this review by stating that I only bought this via Amazon since my local Target was out of stock in this product for weeks. I found it odd since I’ve been buying it there for over a decade and never saw it out of stock. At first I chalked it up to Covid-related shortage, but all other skincare products were available. Reading some reviews regarding possible knock-off version being sold here has me thinking Cera Ve may have realized there’s an issue and took this out of retail (this is purely speculative since I haven’t visited other retail stores besides Walgreens. It wasn’t available there, either).My story: I have ridiculously sensitive skin with rosacea. Any but the most gentle products will cause it to become a blotchy irritated mess. I’ve used Cera Ve since it first came out when my dermatologist told me about this new brand offering a moisturizing lotion receiving rave reviews. While I really like the moisturizing ability of Cera Ve, I did find it to have a strong chemical scent and it could irritate my rosacea-prone areas (upper cheeks and around the nose). However, I believe the formula was tweaked over time and relied on a regiment of using this cleanser and the moisturizing cream for years to great effect. Combined with lifestyle changes, laser treatments, and medication, my rosacea became less of a concern.However, the last few months have been a nightmare with my skin. Starting in February, I noticed increased irritation and redness. Then my skin started to flare up and get hot in ways I haven’t experienced in years. I examined every possible cause: change in sunscreens (my favorite Cotz sunscreen was discontinued, so I tried several replacements including Cera Ve’s new tinted SPF 30). I checked potential lifestyle changes, issues with medication, food, etc. I was getting neurotic and depressed as my skin was often uncomfortable, hurting even, and I didn’t know why. Was this my rosacea just getting worse?About a week ago, my rosacea flared on my cheeks in the worse way. I was taking all my medications, using ice packs, washing my face and trying different skin care products in order to find the root cause. A few days later, I decided to just wash my face with this cleanser and apply the moisturizing cream. A few hours later, my cheeks were again burning. I washed my face and didn’t apply anything in it. I felt better, but noticed the area around my nose felt so raw and sensitive.The next day I began my research. Cera Ve was bought by L’Oreal a few years ago which coincided with the big increase in products offered with many of them either inappropriate for sensitive skin (salicylic acid) or basically the same cream you get in the big tub repackaged in a smaller tube with an added ingredient or two. Worse, the product staples (this cleanser and the moisturizers) were reformulated in order to remove Parabens.Well, I can firmly say that between this cleanser, the moisturizer, and tinted SPF 30 (which has salicylic acid in it), my skin actually became burnt and greatly irritated.I bought Cetaphil cleanser and Vanicream moisturizer and, in a matter of days, my skin is doing much better. I literally have lines on my skin showing where the irritation is healing. If you’ve ever had a chemical peel, it’s the same feeling as it begins from the T-Zone and moves outward.I contacted Cera Ve with my displeasure in these formulation changes and have not heard back. I’ve noticed others with similar issues here and I don’t believe it’s a fake product issue. I believe Cera Ve has really lost their way and become a brand I cannot trust.

  I ordered in September 2019 the CeraVe Hydrating Facial Cleanser 16oz. Today I'm looking to reorder this product but I was curious if anyone else was having continued dry skin like I am and so I looked at a few reviews and I came across a review that someone mentioned of the ingredients on her bottle label that she ordered here didn't match what was listed as ingredients on the advertised Amazons page.  I went and grabbed my almost empty bottle and sure enough my bottle has those 4 ingredients (on the product that delivered instead of the product advertised) that came  from Amazon. I never 2nd guessed that what I received might not be what I ordered, least of all be a Carcinogen . . . especially in women that have BREAST CANCER! I have BREAST CANCER and the labeling on the product advertised on the Amazon site did NOT have these ingredients listed on the label! So I looked today at my bottle and it HAS THOSE 4 INGREDIENTS: Methylparaben, Propylparaben, PEG-40 Stearate, Dipotassium Phosphate. On the app ""Think Dirty"", it shows these ingredients as: Carcinogenicity Tumor promoter, Documented links to BREAST CANCER, Known human carcinogen, Carcinogenic in lab studies, Hormone Disruptor and on and on! I'm on meds to keep my breast cancer from coming back and yet these ingredients, these 4 ingredients that I've been using since it delivered last September is possibly messing with that cancer prevention med!

  Here's my skin profile:Combination, acne prone skin. I use differin gel and Cerave moisturizer nightly. Other products I use regularly: salicylic acid pads, green tea toner, snail repair cream and various chemical and physical sunscreens. I do not wear make-up.This is a go-to. It cleanses my skin nicely without leaving it feeling stripped. It does not feel irritating around the eyes. It does not lather, which is something that I enjoy. The consistency is like that of a very thinand runny lotion. It is fragrance-free and it has no scent. I don't find it to be particularly hydrating per se, but it does not dry me out at all. I slightly prefer this to the Cetaphil sensitive skin cleanser, which has a similar profile and consistency to this one. This leaves my skin feeling a bit more cleansed and nurtured. I use this when I want to ""reset"" my skin and drop down to the bare basics. In my opinion, I think this is suitable for many people who consider their skin to be oily.I took off a star because this cleanser is really good for maintenance, but it doesn't really have any active ingredients to nurture or treat the skin. That's fine though; this product does what it says it will do. It cleanses the skin without irritating it and it is slightly hydrating. And that's it. It lacks a bit of pizazz but I still really enjoy this cleanser. This is a good amount for the price too.

  I've always had oily skin and it's been acne-prone since my late 20's (pregnancy) - I'm now 41. A few months ago my skin started breaking out horribly, but also was sensitive, dry, and even started getting flaky. It was itchy and red. I hadn't really changed my skin care and was using all non-comedogenic products, so I'm not sure what started it. Anyway, I switched up all my skincare to scent-free, sensitive skin products, and started moisturizing more despite it seeming counterintuitive with the acne. I use this cleanser plus a Eucerin moisturizing cream morning and night. Everything started clearing up. Now I just get maybe one pimple every couple of weeks, which I spot treat with benzoyl peroxide cream, then moisturize as usual. I am so grateful that I found this! I will say that despite it seeming very rich, I do still need an additional moisturizer, or my skin feels tight. But it has worked so well for me.

  Idk how to feel about it. I bought it because I've seen a lot of reviews and videos of this cleanser, saying that it doesn't lather or remove makeup but that it cleans well and its gentle.So I bought it and tested it on the back of my hand and after rinsing it off my hand felt and look like I had oil on it. You know when you have a surface with oil and you put water on it but the water just glides on the oily surface... thats just how it feels but at the same time even though my face doesn't feel clean when its wet, when my faces dries, it feels nice and clean.I want to love it so much. I've been using it in the morning to get a gentle cleanse and to take off all the creams that I put at night.

  I have sensitive skin and typically use the Foaming Facial Cleanser, but decided to try this Hydrating version...that was a mistake. My biggest complaint is that it does not wash you face. I wear light makeup and I find this does not take it all off. I have to use additional products to remove my makeup which is probably removing any positive effects of this hydrating product. I'm switching back to the foaming version.

I tried multiple different products from high end facial washer to natural to generic and nothing was working, everything was upsetting my newly sensitive skin.

  I first tried this when I stayed at my sister’s house for a weekend. She swears by it for her hormonal acne caused by PCOS. We have very similar skin, although hers is a bit more severe. I often have trouble with cysts on my chin and neck. Seriously, just within 3 days of use, this wash combatted a nasty breakout, boosted radiance, and made my face softer than it’s ever been. Which quickly prompted me to buy my own. I have been cyst free since using it 2x daily for over a month now.The texture is off putting at first (feels like lotion), but the absorption is amazing. You barely have to rinse it off. I hate messy, foamy washes that drip all over the counter or leave residue. This is very hydrating and light, great for my sensitive skin. I am curious to try other washes by CeraVe, but this will be my permanent go-to from now on. Nothing has worked better for me!

  I will say for all commenting about how it doesn’t remove your make up, do not rely on this for removing make up alone and give it a bad review. You should be applying a make up remover THEN go in and cleanse with this product. It’s not a foaming cleanser because it is meant to be a hydrating.The ONLY bad thing I have to say is the product is it definitely looks like the person who shipped it out did not care what state the bottle would come in.

  This was recommended to me by a dermatologist friend with beautiful skin. She uses Cerave cleanser once in the morning, once at night, with the regular Cerave lotion, and I was so jealous of her skin and tired of buying expensive junk that promises the moon, so I figured I'd give it a shot. I'm very glad I did!Full disclosure: I'm in my 30s with combination skin, blotchiness issues, occasional spots of acne, and suffer from psoriasis on my face. Nothing severe, but far from perfection. I've tried plenty of products and price points.This cleanser/lotion combo works beautifully. My skin is cleansed and refreshed and looks great, never feels overdry, and I'm not paying an arm and a leg for snail goop or milky jelly or whatever marketing bull I was buying before. It feels great to wash my face, too, not like I'm doing a chemical peel or scrubbing a layer of skin off.

  Great product and not drying to the skin. Best when used with silicone facial brush (see photo) for more clean and to exfoliate the face gently. Best to apply moisturizer afterwards for soft and super hydrated skin. 4 stars instead of 5 because I wish it could clean better but I understand the product is super gentle and wants to market it as such. To add soap to the ingredients will make it not super gentle. To solve this dilemma, messaging using silicone facial brush in circular  motion is the answer.I'm disappointed with the seller because the container was made of a folded carton with no tape to secure the products (see photo). Needless to say the box was already opened when I received it. A simple tape would have secured the products but I guess that's too much work for the seller or the seller simply didn't care if the customers received the box opened or not. There's no excuse for such attitude especially if selling is your livelihood!!!

  The older I get, the more I’m focused on making sure the products I use on my skin are actually doing something beneficial.

  Okay so I wasn’t sure what would really help me. My skin was so dry post partum about 1 month in. And I was dying cause in general my face only gets small blemishes and maybe even more oily than dry . So I tried this one for sensitive dry skin, and it helped immensely over time. They say not to use the foaming wash for dry skin so I got the creamier one . It feels like a lotion going on the skin damp and over just a few days to a week I felt little improvement (much more than any other cream / oil I tried) I knew the basics to help my skin would be what I wash it with. So I kept going every morning every night and air dry skin. Soon no more itching, peeling skin on my face ! Now he’s just normal and I can feel a different if I miss a day in washing my skin with this ! So grateful I tried it . Be patient and be consistent and this will help !

  I have been using this for a while and I have to use it with a silicone face scrubber or it does nothing. I wear make up some days and it wouldn’t take it off on it’s own. Definitely have to wash twice with the silicone face scrubber to get it all off. It doesn’t dry my face out so I do think it is moisturizing. No scent which is nice. I won’t be buying it again because it doesn’t leave my face feeling clean.

  What a let down! It removes no make-up whatsoever and doesn't clean your skin. I've used the regular Ceravae for years and thought I'd try this one because my skin has been dry lately. It basically just pushed the make-up around my face, but never washed it off. I don't contour or wear heavy eye make-up; I wear the normal amount. This is a complete waste.

  I LOVED this product. I have struggled with acne since puberty. Yeah. So almost 11 years. Recently it has gotten WORSE. Probably because I work in a kitchen as a kitchen manager. But ever since Hyram reviewed this product I decided to give this a go. I never really looked at cerave products before due to their products lower price and the simple packaging so other products attracted me because I was ignorant on what to look for but after learning a little more about how to find the right skin routine and products I immediately bought this. And after about a month of usage I noticed a huge difference. My skin is clearer and I my blackheads are less frequent. I love it!

  My skin is pretty sensitive. For the longest time I just washed with water because of it, and even that was really drying. My dermatologist declared I had oily skin, and recommended the CeraVe cleanser for ""normal to oily"" skin. God my face just was so taut and dry and itchy after washing, it was the worst! I'd slather in lotion after and that would seem to fix it.But then I tried this stuff! Its sooo niiiiice! No itching! No tautness! Just a dab of lotion on my nose and I'm good. I'm even less oily over the course of the day!Listen to your skin--if your ""gentle"" cleanser makes you dread every face wash, maybe you don't have ""oily"" type skin.Note that this cleanser kinda feels like lotion, it does NOT foam like most soap.

  The sole purpose of me buying this was for makeup and oil removal without stripping my skin of moisture. It actually doesn’t strip anything not even what it’s supposed to strip away. Makeup was still left on my face even after washing it twice with this cleanser. This would be good for someone that doesn’t wear makeup, but I would still not recommend using it then because it seems like it will leave buildup on your face with time. That will then cause allergies in the long run. Might be better just to pick another cleanser that actually cleans instead of sitting on your face like a moisturizer.

    Doesn’t lather otherwise good

  I like this but I’m having a hard time getting passed the fact that it doesn’t lather at all. It does make my skin feel moisturized and is very gentle. But it almost feels like I’m washing my face with a moisturizer. I plan on trying the Cerave foaming cleanser next.

  This is my second time ordering this product and I love it. My skin is very prone to drying out so I like how this face wash does not further the process. I also enjoy the pump and the sheer amount of product in the bottle.

  Because of tik tok, I bought a few items from Cerave and I love everything so far. This cleanser is super gentle for my sensitive/acne-prone skin and I haven't broken out from it. I have nothing bad to say about it... yet.... If I do, I will come back and tell yall the tea later.

    BEST face-wash for sensitive skin
  
",5.0,Maria,"Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  I absolutely love this face wash. It is the only face wash I have tried that does not leave my skin feeling dry and tight after washing it. It is super gentle and doesn't strip your face at all. However, because of the creamy texture, I find that I usually double cleanse to get all the impurities off. My go-to face wash, love it.

    Doesnt break me out & isn't drying
  
",4.0,samantha,"Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2019","









  
  
    
  I have been suffering with very bad acne this past year and i have been struggling to find a product to properly clean my skin without stripping it, without breaking me out anymore than i already am and to help clear up  some of my acne. I bought this because everyone says their dermatologist recommends this brand ( i have not been to one yet, going this weekend- FINALLY). I picked the hydrating one over the original one because Michigan winters are no joke and my skins super dry right now. It's definitely helped with my redness and helps prevent breakouts, it's helped clear up some of my acne but not all of it (hoping the dermatologist helps with that).It's not a miracle in a bottle BUT it doesn't break me out and it doesn't over-dry me or give me that tight feeling. So, I am happy with this face wash & how it cleans my skin.

    Best face wash I've used
  
",5.0,Jackie,"Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2019","









  
  
    
  I have normal to dry skin (during the summer I get an oily T-zone) and this is the ONLY stuff that doesn't leave my face feeling kind of tight. I've using moisturizing face washes before, some far more expensive, and wanted to like them a lot. But this stuff is the truth. I was worried about using this due to being prone to acne break-outs and blackheads, but this doesn't bother it at all - there's no clogging pores and my skincare products sink right in. This has been upgraded to my permanent routine.

  Okay so, I'm terrible with keeping up with skin care because I just get too depressed. I bought this because my skin was dry and rough and now, I've been using it for almost a week, and I'm already seeing improvements. My skin looks cleaner and feels a lot smoother! The best part is that there is no scent!

    Cleanser or Lotion?
  
",2.0,hair lover,"Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  It doesn't lather up and leaves my face feeling like I just put lotion on it, not cleanser. My face just feels greasy/moisturized than clean. Similar to those ""in-shower lotion"" products that didn't really take off. I wouldn't purchase again.

    Burned like hell

  This supposedly gentle cleanser burned like crazy when I put it on. I did this on 3 separate occasions with no other product on my face and it happened all 3 times. I didn't want to break out so I washed it off immediately and gave it to my husband instead. Not good for even mildly sensitive skin.

    *6 MONTH UPDATE*

  This is the ONLY thing that has ever helped my acne!! (Including hormonal acne!) I have been put on many prescriptions, birth control, tried so many products but this is it. I still get breakouts during my cycle but this always clears them up right after and prevents more scarring. I've never felt this confident in my life. I use this once in the morning, once at night, and a light moisturizer and my face is so smooth, hydrated, and healthy c': and my scarring is fiiinally fading after 7 years of cystic acne

    Product excellent shipping terrible
  
",1.0,expectqualityforcost,"Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  The product itself is outstanding.  Do not buy here because shipping had poor internal protection and resulted in the top part of pump breaking in transient presumably.  If broken prior to shipment, shame on person doing the packaging.  No reason for failing to place enough cushion inside shipping box.  Haste or lack of attention resulted in breakage.

  On first use my skin felt amazing. 'Oh this IS good' is what i thought within seconds of using it. Had some facial eczema or something near my nose and on my cheek. Tried a few lotions and methods that haven't worked. Ive been using this on my whole face then covering with vaseline over the trouble areas per some recommendations online. I vaseline twice a day and use this cleaner once. The combo finally has my face looking healed, still have a lil ways to go but the improvement is the best results ive gotten. Will update once i know for sure. Can't say it was just this cleaner but my skin feels great after using it and im very happy with the product.
