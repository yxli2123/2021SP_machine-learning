    Great all-around T-shirt, good price.
  
",5.0 ,G. Will,"Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  For years I wore Carhartt, until their price whent beyond reasonability. I started looking around for a new standard and tried many. I don't know why I didn't think of Dickies early on, because I use their work shirts a lot. I bought my a t-shirt 2 pack to try them out. They were great, I like the heavy weight of the cotton. I haven't had them for more than a couple months now, but have purchased many more. However, the final test is how long they stay really black. Die stability in black died cotton is often very hard to come by.  It was my biggest complaint of Carhartt and another reason I wouldn't accept the  cost increases. So far they're holding up very well through several washings. Excellent shirt for the price. You won't be disappointed.

  Size 2Xl.I like the product! Heavy weight tees are hard to find. Very durable and very comfortable! The only issue is in the description it says its made if pre shrunk cotton.  What does that mean?! Because my 2xl shrunk to a loose fitting XL,and shrunk up to about 2inches below the belt . Which is fine for going out, but not for physical activity or work.  Yes I dried it! I thought being ""pre-shrunk"" cotton it wouldn't shrink so much. So now I need to order another one and not dry it! Otherwise its a nice shirt!

  Although we want to purchase clothing made in the U.S., most of the quality 100% cotton attire that we've considered are union made. Seems the same thing that initially helped the U.S. labor force, only later to decimate U.S. labor, driving manufacturing overseas, is still negatively impacting U.S. manufacturing.We purchased some union-made, expensive, 100% cotton pocket T-shirts and the fit is terrible, too small through the chest. Historically, and amazingly, these Dickies have not only maintained their high quality (truly heavy weight cotton, without being ""too"" heavyweight!) but the fit has been phenomenally consistent over the many years we have been buying them.My frame: over 6'2"", 225 lbs and very physically fit.

My biggest complaint with tee-shirts is when the neck stretches out.  These are holding up great.  I'm buying a few more already.

    Great Fabric, Size Runs Big

  I just purchased a Carhartt tshirt and was disappointed with how thin the fabric was - this Dickies shirt compares favorably. The fabric on the Dickies shirt is heavier, which I like, and it looks great. The large is a little on the big side compared to other tshirt brands I own (such as Champion), but may shrink a bit when it's washed. If you're looking for a heavier cotton tshirt to wear for work or for casual wear, this is a great choice.

I recommend this shirt for all men for an all around good t-shirt that will last many washing and hold its weight all around.

If you want to show off muscles get a large.Heavy weight etc are just terms the manufactures use to sell product. If you go by ounces per square yard for the material you can get a better idea of fabric weight/shirt weight.

  Black Olive looks like brown - not sure why they don't just call it that.  Was disappointed in the color. Material is not soft but not scratchy either.

  This is the first Dickies t-shirt I've purchased. Since it's the first, I wanted to see how the t-shirt fits, its finish, and construction. It's made using nice, heavyweight material, but still soft, and should be great while working. I looked specifically for a t-shirt with a pocket and this Dickies t-shirt meets what I was looking for. I'll wear this t-shirt for a while; time will tell if I will purchase another Dickies t-shirt.

  Certainly heavyweight but there are two issues.  Put T shirt on to check fit...Good fit.  Then washed them before wearing however they shrink more than my regular weight Dickies T shirts.  Now they just go below my belt and shoulders are a bit tight after washing one time.  Worried they will shrink even more as I wash them again.  The pocket is encroaching the arm pit, way off normal position for a pocket.

  I just received these pocketed T shirts this afternoon. Weighing in at 10.5 oz. on my kitchen scale, they were exactly what I was looking for.....until I washed and dried them on low heat. The shrinkage was more to a Large than the extra Large that I had ordered. So I will return them and see if I can find 2XL. Granted, they are heavyweight cotton, and the colors look great, but the shrinkage is more than I expected.UPDATE: I re-ordered 3 more shirts in 3XLm washed and dried them on low heat, and they shrunk down about 1.5 size. This is perfect for me, and that's all that matters. I will buy these again in the near future, as these are very comfortable heavyweight cotton compared to what I currently own from Lands End (which cost twice as much, and are half the weight). By the way,These weighed in at 12.5 oz.

  These t-shirts are just what you'd expect from Dickies...a t-shirt to do work in! I was tired of buying t-shirts that seem to be made of thinner and thinner material. After a few washing, they are ready for the rag bag. Not these T's...I do a lot of work in the yard and garage. I'm running farm equipment, chainsaws, wrenching under the Jeep, you name it. I'm always getting my shirt caught on something and then rip! The Dickies T-shirts can withstand more abuse than your average t-shirt. Because they are a little thicker, they can get warm in the summer, but are great for the fall, winter and spring.

Did shrink a little after the first wash but shrunk evenly with and length. They are sized a little big but not enough to be to baggy. Just right for good movement and again very comfortable. I wore cathart until I tried these dickies shirts. Slightly better quality than Carhart but more comfortable and more durable and cheaper.

  Nothing to dislike.  These Dickie's t-shirts are heavy weight, but comfortable cotton material, very nicely sown together and selling for a reasonable to low price (check around, price varies between $10 and $20 per t-shirt and by color).  If you prefer a very light cotton fabric, these may not be to your liking.  But the heavyweights are durable, colorfast (so far after 10 washings) are fine on their own for for mild weather and make a fine base layer in cooler weather.  I don't know where else you can find this quality for this price!

  My husband and son both extra large and this shirt is a tad too small at extra large. I ordered them 2X large and it was better fit. My husband is 5’11 and 185 pounds. Guess it depends on how loose or tight you want your shirt to fit. My husband does construction so like to have room to move. I did like the thickness.

  I started wearing Dickies when I was working on a dusty summer, home remodel job. I needed a shirt pocket and I didn't want to wear a button-up shirt.I had been putting my carpenter's pencil in my back pocket, but it would break when I sat or squatted. I bought the First Dickies T-shirt just so I'd have somewhere to put a pencil. But, I discovered that the Dickies shirts are very durable and the knit neck doesn't stretch out as quickly some of the other pocketed t-shirts do. I also like the cotton. Some of the other ""work"" T-shirts use synthetic material. I like the feel of cotton.I tend to buy the dark colors Dickies,  so they don't work very well under dress shirts. But, I wear Dickies under the heavy sports shirts or Pendleton shirts I often wear in the fall, winter and spring.

  My job has me outside mowing, trimming, digging, and painting among many other physical activities so it was great to find a tough comfortable shirt available in orange. A must for my job that’s frequently near busy roads. I’m roughly 5’11 190 and the large fits great though it is a little long which I happen to like. The shirt is thick enough to provide a bit of shielding from my edger’s flak so that’s a major plus for me and the chest pocket comes in handy more than you might realize at first glance. All of this is combined with a low price tag so you can’t go wrong. I’ve been wearing these all summer and will continue to do so!

  These shirts have been great, until my last order.  Nice heavy weight, fits good and true to size but...they have changed. As others have mentioned the pocket is now under the armpit. Others I have ordered, exact same ad offering, were nice. The little Dickies logo on the pocket was always on my left chest. But this last shirt the logo and corner of the pocket disappears under the armpit. Leads me to believe these are seconds or rejects.  Anything I put in the pocket will now rub under the arm. I only ordered 1 this time because they were sold out on a lot of the other colors. I will just keep it as opposed to sending it back because I washed it before wearing it for the first time. Too bad because I am afraid to order them again.

  I just wanted some simple shirts, neutral colors, no fuss. But, the sizes were odd, then I found that they were inconsistent. Of the same shirt, and the same size, they were physically different sizes. Not only that, but the stitching is commonly off. There are all kinds of weird angles and bulges that washing does not even out. These aren't worth it, even as work shirts. I prefer Hanes Beefy-Ts. The quality and sizing is far more consistent.

I can wear either Large or Extra large comfortably but i like a snug fit that will stretch after 30 minutes of use in the large size so i am buying 6 more in different colors.

  Nothing compares with a 100% cotton T-shirt for comfort and utility, and I have tried almost every manufacturer of T shirts out  there.  I can't say that I am disappointed with any of them.  However, over time, I have come to prefer heavy weight T shirts, with a pocket, and there are not that many labels making these.  I have become rather picky about my T's over time, and have not been completely satisfied with any of the ones that I had bought.......until now.  I purchased couple of these a few months back, and was immediately  impressed with the quality, fit and feel of these T-shirts.  It is all that I buy now, and have them in most of the available colors.  I don't even mind the logo on the pocket anymore.

  These Tee-shirts are really nice (especially for the price).  The material is thick, which I've always liked (similar to a Carhart tee thickness, but at a better price).  The neck does not shrink or shrivel, and the breast pocket does not pucker.  They're a perfect tee.

  Nice shirt, definitely will wear it under a flannel this fall.Here’s why it’s not five stars, really not big deals:-Thinner than what comments and descriptions lead you to believe-Sizing: So usually I’m sitting between a 2X and an XL but typically I fill out the XL with a large frame/bulky athletic build while sitting comfortable with the 2X. iN THIS ORDER, I got an XL and it almost seems like I could drop down to a large. The shirt fits but for those of you who wear XL that are on the taller/thinner side, not that short/thicker side (I’m 6’1, 250 lbs), I would definitely go to an L or else you might be swimming in it.Overall, nice shirt and I’m satisfied

    NOT ""pre-shrunk""!!!  Fit nicely a first, now too small after merely a cold wash and air-dry.
  
",2.0 ,coldsteelburns,"Reviewed in the United States October 29, 2019","









  
  
    
  After reading the reviews and measurements about the sizes, I went with the large, which is usually just right in length at sleeves and overall, but almost always too large at the waist and chest.Anyway, when I got it and tried it on it fit great, although the sleeves were just on the verge of being too short for my liking, since I'm on the skinnier side with narrower shoulders.  I was happy with it, and seeing that it was ""pre-shrunk"" I figured I'd be good.  After washing it in cold water and putting it on an air-dry in the dryer (no heat), it came out quite a bit shorter in over all length and at the sleeves and now is just way too short for my liking, which in unfortunate since I bought an extra before I washed the first one. So once again I'm stuck with more clothes that don't fit.  Everything else is fine except for arm and waist length, which unfortunately makes up half of the overall fit and look of a shirt.  Don't fall for the ""pre-shrunk"", it will shrink just as much as every other cotton shirt.  I bet it would shrink even more if I actually used any amount of heat to dry it.FWIW, I'm about 5' 10"" and 130lbs.  Maybe the large-tall size would work out better, but I'm afraid to waste any more money on these guessing games, and with my luck it would end up looking like a dress, even after washing and drying.

  I bought a black dickies shirt just like this a couple months back from a department store and I loved it. But these ones were pretty big compared to the one I have. I’m not sure if I just need to wash them a few more times or what but definitely not the same shirt. Other than that, great quality of course. Can’t go wrong with a Dickies!!

  I bought T-shirts in XL and I am very impressed.  I also bought some large tall shirts to try out the size, however, they were tight on the chest and extremely long for me who is 6 foot one in 240 pounds. This wasn’t expected though considering the sizing chart already mapped us up. I really like how thick the shirts are they seem very durable and are a great work shirt. I am a nurse for reference.

  Bought 2XL but they run small compared to other t-shirts. Bought for working in but shirts appear to be skimping on material as they are about an inch shorter than the Carhartts I usually buy. Also a bit narrower. Weight is ok, feels the same as the 6.75 oz. I usually buy. Smaller sizes may be ok, but for larger guys they may show ""Plumbers' Crack"" when bending and stooping.

  4/5 because there is no perfect shirt - yet that I’ve found.  This is among the best with a heavyweight cotton-poly blend, breast pocket & flattering, professional-yet-stylish fit.Ordinarily, I’ll wear Champion ringers or Ralph Lauren polos but I decided to go all-Dickies so this is my new go-to.I’m 6’, 230 and I find the fit flattering.  It’s a work shirt so you can move and bend without it sliding up your back or having it too long while working; perfect length for that.  So far, no pit swamps either.

Brown tees are usually closer to either chocolate or khaki, rarely in this caramel-like in-between.Now I can pitch the old one, because this shirt is built to last! Double-stitching at the hem, sleeves are a decent length without breaking at the elbow. Shirt itself is long enough without looking like a sun dress. Definitely a thicker fabric.

  I bought this T-shirt in a 1X because I like them loose to lounge around in. Also, if it shrinks, I won't have to worry about it too much. The material is on the heavier side, which I wanted.  I wish the neck area was smaller, but that's what you get in this size. I can tell if something is the correct size by measuring it across to 24"", even though this measured at 25"".  I also like having a tight front pocket.  UPDATE: The collar looks okay and not as large as I thought!

  This shirt looks good, the fabric is substantial and durable, and I like it, as I do the same shirt I previously bought in a different color and the same size.

",5.0 ,C. Geary,"Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2018","









  
  
    
  There are multiple different listings for Dickies t-shirts here on Amazon.  They aren't all the same quality of shirt so be forewarned.  These are made in Mexico &/or Nicaragua.  These are the shirts you want.  The other listings are Dickies shirts made in Pakistan.  They are terrible even though the reviews say otherwise.  These shirts are prime fabric, 100% cotton,  that's very stretchy.  It's highly wrinkle resistant,  lays flat & is easy to fold.  Something is terribly wrong with the shirts made in Pakistan.  They will not lay flat,  they're always wrinkled... literally, like you balled them up & put them under your mattress.  These shirts offered here are the winners.  They have a pen/pencil slot in the chest pocket.  The bad shirts don't have that slot.These shirts do shrink a little after washing/drying so I'd advise buying one size larger than your actual size.  You're gonna love 'em...

  Nice quality Shirt for $11. Amazed at such a big difference in price based on the color. It's not quite the same quality as Carhartt, but the same weight cotton, and less expensive. I would say the XL is a ""normal-sized"" XL, which means its about the same size as a large Carhartt Tshirt.

  IMHO, there's only one time a cheap, thin T-shirt is called for, and that's on a humid, 100 degree summer day. These T-shirts are pretty thick, and worth every penny. While they are perhaps not the softest or thickest cotton available, for the price they are more than excellent. (They are, after all, T-shirts...)

  I bought a number of these in different colors. The Heather grey are a blend, NOT 100% cotton 90% cotton/ 10% Polyester. . DECEPTIVE!!!! They all feel like sandpaper to the skin. I have tried washing and softening them 8-10 times. No Luck I can't wear any of them for more than a few minutes. IF THESE WERE SOFT, I would compliment the heavyweight fabric, slight oversized fit and value at a sale price. But I CANNOT wear them! Whatever is in the fabric makes them unwearable like the worst chemical laden poly/cotton shirts of the 70's.

  I'm loving these shirts so far.  It's a little early to comment on there durability.  The shirts are a thick cotton, but not overly hot.  The chest pocket is very useful and includes a separate area to place a pen or pencil.  The shirts arrive a little large, but shrink to expected fit once washed.  If your trim I think you will like the fit of these shirts.  If you have some extra in the middle then I would go a size larger.  The shirts are a great length to cover your backside, but don't look like you're wearing a nightgown. The Royal Blue is a really true blue and great for anyone that loves the color.  Have held up to carpentry work environment so far, but time will tell how the really hold up to tough work.

  I bought these for my husband and I wasn't sure if it would last multiple washes. He can only wear cotton clothes and my other fear was shrinkage. The fabric is heavy duty which is really nice. I do wash with cold water and dry on medium heat as I personally do not want to deal with shrinkage. It does hang loose on him, but that is his preferred fit.  Based on the heavy duty material, I am confident this will last him a lot longer than an average T-shirt.

    I've Found My Perfect Work Shirt
  
",5.0 ,Brandi Z,"Reviewed in the United States May 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  I was looking for more plain shirts to wear for work, something that would hold up to not only the washing machine and dryer, but the general hazards of working in a production environment. I was also wanting more length, tired of other shirts with hems that seemed to roll up as I sat, stood, and bent over. So many other shirts labeled as unisex or men’s don’t always work for women when part of the length has to go around a larger chest.I ordered an XL first since I usually wear that size in other brands’ t-shirts, but found it to be too baggy even after the initial wash and dry. I got the regular L next, and after the first wash didn’t notice any shrinkage, and it fit perfectly. It was exactly how I wished all of my t-shirts fit, roomy yet fitted, and long enough that I didn’t have to constantly worry about pulling the hem down throughout the day as I moved. When I first wore it to work, out of habit I’d go to pull the hem down only to realize it was still good where it was. This fact alone made me so happy I decided to purchase this shirt.The price point is a little higher than what I’ve normally paid for a plain t-shirt, but with it being heavyweight and fitting me practically perfectly, it’s worth it. I’ve already added more to my cart to last me a full work week, and I’m happy I’ve found something I feel comfortable in at work.

  I want to start our by saying that I am, in general, happy with both the quality of the product and the timeliness of the delivery.I used to buy Champion tee shirts ;with featured a decent weight fabric and a generous cut.  A few years back Champion was bought out by Fruit of the Loom and the fabric got lighter, and the cut got skimpy--now resembling the Fruit of the Loom tee shirts.I then switched to Dickies (regular weight) which I can buy at Walmart.  It featured an even heavier fabric and an even more generous cut than the Champion tees of old.  I am happy with the Dickies standard weight tees.  But Walmart carries them in on black, white and gray only.  I wanted colors.I ordered the Dickies heavy weight. When it arrived I tossed it in the laundry along with a brand new Dickies standard weight.  When they were laundered I handled both and they did not feel much different.  I examined the construction and they appear to be the same quality (excellent).  The heavy weight was made in Nicaragua, and the standard weight was produced in the Honduras.  But both seem of similar assembly quality.I decided to weigh them on my kitchen scale:  Stardard weight (XL) 9.25 ounces; Heavy weight (XL) 9.75 ounces a difference of 1/2 ounce (5.26%).  Hardly a heavy weight.So if you are not interested in colors, I recommend the standard weight; if you want the colors go with the heavy weight.If you want a true heavy weight tee I only know of Duluth Trading whose tees are of a true heavy weight fabric and the cut is generous but the product is expensive.  I find the Dickies to be a much better value.  For tall men, the Dickies are available in a ""tall"" too.A good product, but not really a heavy weight.

  I bought this shirt because of it's pocket, high rating, and low price.  I'm dissapointed.  First, if your a big guy, NFL, lumberjack, you'll probably love this shirt.  I'm 5'11, 165 lbs, career military.  This fits me nice in the shoulders and chest, but hangs like a dress around my middle, because there is NO shape or form fitting.  I could live with that.  Wouldn't be the first shirt made for larger people that I have to have tailored to fit me below the chest, but here's the real kicker.  There's something about the design of the sleeves and the weight of the fabric that causes the whole shirt to lift up and bunch around the chest and neck if I lift my arms up shoulder height or higher.  That's definitely something you don't want in a T-Shirt that is supposed to be soft and comfortable.  This cotton is pretty stiff.  Maybe after a few washes it'll be softer, but it seems like a fairly stiff weave.  It certainly doesn't hang/drape like the pictures shown.  Lastly, the pocket, as shown in the picture, wraps around the side of the chest and is largely useless except for keeping a pen in.  It does have a separate little pen spot in the pocket, but the opening is too small to use most modern pens with a rubberized grip.  So, all in all, pretty disappointing for me.

  DON'T BUY DICKIES T-SHIRTS! I was looking for the perfect crew-neck T-Shirt. I thought I found it with the Dickies brand. The material was thicker than most other T-Shirts of this price. The stitching was good. And the crew-neck was perfect. Or, so I thought at the time. So, I bought a bunch of them. I invested a lot of money in what I thought would be a great all-purpose product. Sadly, and to my great dismay, I have learned that the crew-necks are not the high quality I first thought. The crew-neck itself starts to wrinkle and fade at the top within only two washings. As it is the crew-neck that makes this T-Shirt look good, that means the shirt is essentially ruined. I bought so many of these and enough time has passed that I will never get my money back. So, DON'T BUY DICKIES T-SHIRTS, NO MATTER HOW GOOD THEY MAY LOOK ON THE AMAZON WEBSITE. JUST DON'T DO IT!

  I have been on a quest to find the right tshirt for many years now.  I almost thought this was going to be adequate for me until I washed it.  I'm so tired of the huge (fat) tshirts that Carhartt makes in the K87 Workshirt line.  I'm 6'3"" 230lbs.  The Carhartt XL shirt is huge on me, but the Large is too small.  This Dickies XL Heavyweight tshirt fits almost exactly like a Carhartt Large, except the sleeves are shorter.  The sleeve length on these Dickies is pretty much unacceptable and need to be about 1 inch longer.  I like the colors available, but these definitely are not heavy weight shirts.  Medium weight at best, which is ok too.The best, most accurate sizing in a tshirt I have found so far is the Wrangler Riggs Workwear tshirts.  They are also definitely a heavy weight shirt and well made.  Unfortunately, they don't keep their shape as long as I would like.  The neck, sleeves and bottom get kind of curled after a dozen or so washings and start to look a bit tacky.I have also tried Key tshirts, which have good fabric and stay nice for a long time.  However, they have the same fit issues as the Carhartt shirts.  The XL is short and fat and just way huge and out of proportion.  The large fits pretty nice as long as it is the heather, stretchy fabric.  The all cotton Key large shirts are too small.  I may try a 2XL Dickies just for kicks to see if I get lucky and the fit is right.  Otherwise, it's back to the quest to find a proper tshirt.

  Much like the rest of the folks on here- I came for an alternative to my Carhartt work shirts.  Ordered a few colors of these dickies to try on. Fit wasn’t bad... shirt length was a hair long if you ask me, but not terrible.  Chest fit well and there’s tons of colors to choose from.My only complaint is the description of “heavyweight”.  These shirts are just a bit thicker than your standard Haines pocket T-shirt. I wouldn’t call them heavy weight by any means.  Now are they as thick as my Carhartt work shirts? No. But are they HALF the price of my Carhartt shirts? Yes, they sure are.I’ll probably keep them to lounge around the house, run errands, etc.  I like that there is a ton of color options.  But I doubt these shirts will hold up at a job site very long.Not a bad shirt- I’ll probably buy more in the future.  but you should set your expectations before buying.

  Argh. Most recently I ordered the ""Black Olive"" - which is a unique and nice shade of very dark olive green. But I received plain black. Since I prefer to rate products based on the product and not on a careless shipping mistake, these shirts still have to get 5 stars. They're larger (girth) and longer than Hanes Beefy T's of the same size e.g. XL, and notably heavier fabric too. That makes them very similar to the big ""capital C"" car that ends in hart brand of work clothes, but significantly less obnoxiously pricy. In other words, they're REAL work clothes, not trendy and overpriced. They've got good stitching and an excellent pocket that has a pen slot but is still just wide enough to slip my Galaxy Note 8 in the main part for easy use in speaker phone or podcast mode.  These are my go-to T-shirts now, and are quickly replacing my disintegrating collection of Beefy-Ts.Note that some very popular colors of Dickie's T-shirts are available in 2-packs that come out cheaper per shirt - WARNING - they are not the same weight or overall quality as the single-packed T-shirts. The fabric is thinner, stitching is lower quality (I've had to re-sew sleeve hems, for example), and the pocket does not include the pen slot.
