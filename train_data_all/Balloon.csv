  Out of the 30 balloons I blew up only one had a defect. I’m happy with those odds. They are good quality balloons and I love the color variety. They added a bit of something special to my twins’ birthday party. I’m very satisfied with my purchase and currently looking for more ways to incorporate balloons in my life because I have so many now. The balloons have been hanging behind my TV for over 2 weeks and it looks like blue and red are tying for the prize of staying inflated the longest... just in case you were wondering.

  I blew up 20 of these and 3 hours later, 2 times brushing my teeth, scrubbing my lips, using flavored chapstick, my lips are still numb and just have an absolutely terrible taste.  I’m not exaggerating, it’s horrific.  I’ve washed my hands with 5 different soaps and they still stink.  Completely not worth it.  They really do smell & taste that awful.

  We've blown up 4 so far and 3 of them popped already within minutes of inflating them! The first one I thought I'd just inflated too much but the others I didn't inflate as much and they were still popping for no reason. One of them popped while my youngest was just carrying it around and now he has a big raised up red mark on his arm where it popped on him. He's now afraid of the rest of them and never wants to touch a balloon again. What a waste of money, we won't be using the rest.

  This product would have been great except only certain colors filled properly. The orange ones were so thick they would pop or were hard to tie. The pink ones were super thin n the slightest touch after being filled they would pop. Some of the blues had pin holes so after blowing them up they would deflate... smh! Overall of 120 balloons about 30 were a waste!

  Balloons are nice & sturdy.  No overwhelming smell as with some deeply colored balloons.  They had a nice glossy sheen to them & I liked that there were multiple tones of the same color.  Filled these up the day before our party & transported them filled to save time.  No loss of air & all we’re sturdy enough that none were lost during transportation.

    Great Variety But Inconsistent Quality Makes Many Useless

  120 Assorted Colors of Balloons at this price point seems like a good deal. If the quality of the product was consistent it would be but unfortunately its not. Approximately 1 out of every 4 of the balloons are flawed. The material is so thin in some places that it looks like a small hole. On some the material is thick in one area but thin in the others making it difficult to blow up or it pops in your face just from the air in your lungs. Some of the balloons are very pliable making them easy to work with. Others are so tight if you bat them the wrong way they pop. My dog likes to jump at them and chase around the house. Other brands she can easily chase for 10 or 15 minutes before they wear out. With these she either pops it immediately or it wears out in less than five minutes. Kids tried using some for water balloons and more of them popped from the weight of the water while filling instead of on impact when thrown. I know Im not necessarily using these balloons for ""regular"" purposes but Ive used plenty of other brands for the same purposes that greatly exceeded the performance of these. I wont be buying again. The pics I shared shows one baloon that is good quality no problems. The other picture shows the thin spots and pinholes I mentioned. The air started leaking very slowly out of the pinhole immediately. I deflated and went to blow up again and it popped in my face after two full breaths blown into it. Just irritating.

  If you're looking for beautiful color balloons that won't pop and don't lose air, these are your best choice.The colors are vibrant and fun, and have high quality. It's been over 5 days after party and most balloons  aren't losing any air. Normally balloons deflate on their own in a few hours or days, but these won't.

  Nice not thick. Very few defective. Long lasting. I used the to fill up our trampoline for a birthday party. The kids had a blast bouncing and popping the balloons. One bag made a thin layer on a 15 foot trampoline but was a perfect amount once the kids got in and started bouncing. You could definitely use more than one bag.

    Terrible Quality - Half of them Pop (just laying on the floor)
  
",1.0,AP,"Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  The quality of these balloons is subpar.. about half of them popped while they were just laying on the floor (no one even touching them). Some popped a few minutes after inflating, some within the hour. Do NOT recommend.More info: I bought these after a set i got from the dollar store (NONE of which popped by the way, none!). I wanted more so i figured i'd get some from Amazon so i got these. A few days later they arrived and i inflated a bunch and half popped within the hour. I figured they maybe some defective in there, maybe i over inflated them,  tried different colors, etc. I gave them the benefit of doubt., but after having these around for a few more days they keep popping randomly (some are still around but most either deflated or popped). I got these for my 2 year-old to play with and needless to say that did not work! Long story short -- these are at best hit/miss so i would not recommend them. If you did buy them, just inflate to about half of what you would a regular balloon and you should be ok. Better yet, buy from another seller. I hope this helps.

",3.0,Work as Intended,"Reviewed in the United States July 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this for my daughter's birthday.I used an electric air pump tp blow it up.Overall, everyone was 80% happy with the balloons.Here are a few things to note and be aware of when you purchase these balloons...1. Brown powder inside each balloon.  I'm guessing the powder is to keep the balloons from sticking and easier to blow.  I don't think it's a huge issue, unless you want to blow these balloons with your mouth... My daughter (6 year old) wanted to blow one herself, and I said, ""most definitely not"".2. It's very smelly.  I'm guessing it might be the smell of the material used, latex, but it is very smelly if it's in a bedroom for a ""surprise"".  So, I recommend to use these balloons outdoors and not indoors.  The smell is quite nauseating.3. Pre-stretch.  I don't think these balloons pop easily due to the thickness of it.  At the same time, it'll be much easier to pre-stretch them before blowing them up.I think that's about it!  My older daughter (7 year old) has a birthday coming up in a few months, but I don't think I will be re-purchasing these ones....For outdoor use and air pump assisted, I think these balloons will do.  But for indoors, look elsewhere.

    DISGUSTING -- do not buy!
  
",1.0,KK,"Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2021","









  
  
    
  If I could give zero stars I would.  Initially when these arrived I thought they were great.  The balloons at the top of the bag were totally normal.  But as I started reaching down further into the bag for different colors, I realized there was some sort of powder in the bag settled at the bottom covering the balloons in the bottom of the bag.  Those balloons tasted disgusting and I can only assume it's the powder.  I took all the balloons out in the sink to try to give them a rinse and they all smelled like rotten fish.  And now there is a dark brown liquid coming out of them.  I don't know what this is but it's disgusting and potentially unsafe for children.

  I read the reviews of this product before I ordered them and there were some negative comments about leaking, popping, bad odor  etc.  I find that none of these problems exist.  They blow up easily, hold their air for days.  I even put little prizes inside some of them by stretching out the neck and pushing candy or other things in.  Even put a Harmonica in one as a surprise gift.  Yes there is some rubber odor and that was expected as they are made out of rubber.  Great product.  Don't let the negative reviews turn you off.  My experience is very positive.

  While these are pretty colors.  When blown up they are a bit translucent.  I bought these awhile ago to have for later use.  They are junk, pure junk.  You can just look at them and they pop (being sarcastic, they are this bad).  I did not over inflate, I just blew one up, tied it and it popped.  It was by nothing sharp just popped.  Useless for outside.  I wish I could get my money back eventhough its after the return date.  Amazon needs to make a larger return date.

  Soooo I originally ordered this product in April  and loved it. Wrote a great review even! I liked these balloons so much that I ordered it again!  I just clicked the order again button, thinking I would be getting the exact same thing. WRONG! I recieved them in a totally different package, so I already knew that they weren't going to be the same. These balloons were not the same at all. They were different colors then the first pack (this back only had 6 different colors, the first one had 11). This pack did not blow up anywhere as big as the first pack. And finally the biggest issue I had waa that these balloons are not durable at all! They pop very very easily! Half of them popped just from blowing them up (with my mouth not a machine!). So honestly I really did love this product the first time, but felt cheated when I ordered the exact same thing and did not recieve that. You might end up with a good product but you might not, so to be safe I would not recommend ordering from this company.

  Exceeded my expectations! I was ready to spend a dollar less on another brand, but reviews were not as good. I decided to spend the extra dollar for these. I also needed next day delivery so I could blow them up for a party the following day. The colors are nice - metallic-like colors - makes them look expensive. They blow up larger than I thought. Wasn't sure what 12"" inflated would look like. Nice large size. I blew a couple up by mouth and they blew up easily. I used an air pump for the rest. The stems are a good length making it easy to tie. I even went on YouTube for balloon tying tips. Using the two-finger method worked best for me - fast and easy. I still have one of the balloons and it is still full after 2 days! You will not be disappointed with these balloons. Look no further.  I highly recommend!

Has a chemical powder noted when inflating.Update: one week later the smell from the balloons has filled the room.  Changing our rating from 2 to 1 star and dIsposing of them.

  I didn't really think much about buying balloons; I just needed them for my daughter's birthday. These are the best balloons!

I've never thought about balloons before (unless they don't last long enough for the party), but these are some good balloons.*update*I blew these up on November 2 for my daughter's birthday, and it is December 3; I kept a couple of balloons blown up - my kids like to play with them - and this blows me away, but those balloons are still going strong more than a month later.

  So I got these to make  balloon columns. I liked the variety of colors...but I for sure did not get 10 or 12 of each color. One color I got 8 and I did get a couple of shredded balloons.

They held up and none popped while I was building the balloon columns. So.... Good quality but not exactly what I was hoping for

  I love the color variety  of these balloons.  They are a bit more pricey  than what you buy in the store. They are easy  to inflate  even for some kiddos. They are definitely  thin so they do pop some. Or package arrived with one damaged balloon.  The reason I am giving then 4 stars is because  of their capacity  to be blown up to sizes beyond what the package  days. There is the constant  fear  of them popping  during this stage  but honestly it is really cool to see them blown  up 24 inches. It also gave us time to teach about historesus.  Honestly worth buying them for all their flexibility  both to decorate and be science  experiments.

  These balloons blow up nicely. In fact, my 3-year-old took one out of the bag and was able to start blowing it up. He couldn't figure out how to pinch it off while he took a breath, otherwise he could have easily blown the balloon up on this own.I haven't come across any major duds yet, but I assume there will be a couple. However, for the money, you can not go wrong with these balloons. The colors are fantastic. They are easy to inflate and tie. They are exactly what you expect from a balloon.

  I have ordered this particular set of balloons twice.  The first time, there were two colors that were duds.  All those popped almost immediately, or had small holes so wouldn't hold air.  For $9, I figured it wasn't that big a deal and ordered another bag.  This second bag has been significantly worse.  The material is much thinner, and so all of them pop extremely easily.  They also have this awful taste that lingers in your mouth after you blow them up.  I will look for another brand next time.  Worth paying a little more to not have to blow up three or four or five duds every time you want one.

  WARNING: DO NOT OVER INFLATE! These are great balloons for the price. Great colors, even when inflated. BUT only fill balloons about half size or they will pop. About 20 min after filling half the package, they started popping (on their own, with no interference. After maybe the 6th one in 30 minutes, we couldn't take the fright anymore, so we had to manually pop them all and start over. Thankfully we'd only blown up half the package. They have been sturdy the second time around, so lesson learned. They seem to be able to blow up very large, but resist this urge and only inflate to a medium size.

I'm always looking to order them in a larger quantity as well as for ones that won't pop super easily because they like to play games with balloons, including sometimes sitting on them. I will say that we've only inflated a few of these since receiving them, but they're a nice thickness, still easily enough to inflate, and a nice pearly sort of color.

  They're mostly fine - inflate easily, stay inflated. I assume it's because they're made of latex, but these balloons leave an unpleasant taste when inflated manually, and also leave a bit of a residue on your hands afterwards. The sheen and richness of color are less pronounced when inflated - not hugely surprising, but just FYI since this was a factor I used to decide between this and another set of balloons.

  Not very impressed with this purchase. The balloons are covered in a gross tasting powder that even dries out your hands when tying them. They don't inflate well eithrt and they are on the small end. I had a couple pop on me when I was just starting to blow them up. I do not recommend these balloons.

  Have used these for some quarantine bday party festivities (got to keep things festive for the kids!). Pretty easy to blow up, nice colors, a little on the thin side so they can pop easily. Of the 20 or so that I have blown up, one had a hole and two popped while blowing up. Overall worth the price despite the couple of issues I encountered. Would buy again!

  Exactly what it says it is. Balloons are easy to inflate, I bought a hand pump that made it go a little faster since I blew up all 120 at once. Stayed inflated for a long time, it’s been over a week. Puppy does not appreciate. Put 1 star for flavor, I didn’t personally taste it... but it’s still a balloon.

",4.0,Nicolas C Hsieh,"Reviewed in the United States October 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  The first few balloons popped but it was because I over inflated them. When inflated properly, none of the balloons popped. Filled these up with water and the little kids could not pop them no matter how many times they threw them. One con about these is that they came dirty like they fell on the ground before being packaged so I would wash them especially if you're blowing them up with your mouth. Some of the balloons had dirt inside so you can hear it rattling around.

  Every birthday I like to put balloons in the room for my kids to wake up to. Normally I’d go to the store and get whatever they had. Because this year is so different I ordered these online. Not a single 1 of the 120 balloons popped in blowing it up, or putting it in the room. The kids have been kicking balloons for 3 hours without a pop yet. Unbelievable!!!
