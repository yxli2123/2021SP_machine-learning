    I miss the metal containers
  
",3.0,margaret fergus,"Reviewed in the United States March 24, 2019","









  
  
    
  so this box of bandaids was smashed when i got it ,, so i couldn;t put the bandaids in the medicine cabinet because the box wouldn't stand up.  I miss the metal containers.  Also for some reason they didn't agree with my skin ... when i removed them after 1 day it left red marks.  maybe i am alergic to something in them.

  I like this flexibility fabric band aid better than the water block one.  It can use longer, stay more comfortable, and easy to take it out. And the price is valuable, it has 100 piece with 3 different size. One thing I don’t like is, I need to find the small container to organize these band aid. So, I still like to buy it again.

  It's hard to find a bandaid that stays on.  THESE ARE WONDERFUL!  I kept searching my pharmacy to no avail.  Then, DING, it dawned on me to look on Amazon, and there  they were!

  Band Aid is, by far, the best brand on the market for bandages.  This particular purchase was needed for my daughter's hands and fingers.  She works in a warehouse requiring significant manual labor resulting in extremely dry, cracked hands and box/paper cuts on her fingers and hands. Her hands are petite and regular work-like gloves do not fit her properly and caused blisters so she had to go without gloves.  These bandages acted  like gloves for her, they speeded up recovery of the wounds she'd attained and prevented new ones from arising.

  These band aids are okay for very small cuts. Most of the band aids would not cover more than a small cut. There are very few that would be big enough to cover much more than a pin prick. The description say assorted sizes but most are small. Would bot buy again. I need larger bandages and most of these are useless.

",3.0,Fernside,"Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  I love the cloth-feel of these, and they don't irritate my skin - but what is super annoying is as soon as you put them on, they start shedding threads and I have to keep cutting the strings off.  It's similar to an unfinished hem on cloth - it's just keeps  shredding off string by string - but they don't just fall off - you have to cut them off because there is still adhesive on one side and then your scissors gets gummy.

  Item came completely crushed, yet not seemingly from the other items shipped, as the box and packaging around it was all OK.They're bandages, so most of them are still fine and usable, but some got torn. The picture is after I ""fixed"" the box by bending things back together and folding it up as best as it can be. Definitely looked worse on opening.Still, shipping and packaging problems are shipping and packaging problems. The item itself works as you'd expect it to. Sticks on, covers a minor wound. Can't complain about that.

  These stay on.  I don't mind that they sometimes leave a bit of stickiness when you take it off as they don't fall off my kids throughout the day even when it gets wet.  The bandages prevent my little one from scratching his mosquito bites and he would forget to tell me if the bandage falls off.  These stay on even in tricky locations (e.g. bend of the leg, etc).  Also prefer them because they allow the wound to breath, there is no adhesive along the edges of the gauze, so you can keep a wound covered, but it still gets to breath.

  First time a J and J product has disappointed us. This fabric bandaid is not waterproof and often does not stick correctly. Not pliable enough for example to use on a finger or other awkward or angled area. Heavy looking. J and J makes so many varieties of this item...this is not the one for every day use  in our family. We like the sheer or antibiotic bandaid. Thought we would try this type but big mistake. It is heavy duty in terms of the weight of the fabric. A disappointment.

  I just received these bandaids yesterday & didn’t have it on for a 1/2 day before it started to fray & look raggedy. This is  likely due to washing my hands often....I suppose it just couldn’t survive the water. The adhesive seems to be just fine... in fact, it stuck to my finger when trying to remove it-causing some discomfort.Based on so many reviews, I thought these were the best option. Definitely wouldn’t recommend.

  I bought these because that small box that you buy is pricey and you don't usually get that many.

I have one of the ""old"" tin boxes for band aids and it's finally full with plenty left over.  Highly recommend.

  I got 3 different sizes in this order that was stated to be all the same size.  The 2 surprise sizes are a bit bigger and a bit smaller although most were of the advertised size.  Although these fabric kind will fray if you're wearing one on a hand and using that hand, they stick very, very well and are comfortable.  So much better than those plastic ones that come off so easily and feel awful.  Good band-aids, just was surprised to get the different sizes.

  The old kind of band-aids that aren't complete pieces of crap. I have learned over the years that while many non-brand items are just find, band-aids seem to be an exception. I have gone through so many cheap vinyl-plastic type bandaids and finally decided to stick with the originals. These are comfortable, breathable, and stay on until you want them to come off. I use these in all my first aid kits and am very pleased. This box comes with about a years worth of band-aids in different sizes.

  There's a reason that adhesive bandages are colloquially called ""Band-Aids""; they're commonly cheap and very durable. I personally prefer fabric over plastic because of their durability, aside from not being water-proof. This 100 pack doesn't lie either, it came with 100 strips and varying sizes as well, great for families and refilling first-aid kits.

  I'm not sure how to write a review for something as ubiquitous a Bandaid Brand banagages. I do prefer the all cloth bandages, they flex with your skin and makes it easier to use that injured area normally which promotes bloodflow and healing.My only con is that if I must use bandaid for a few days in the same spot, I always get a contact dermatitis or some hives. Washing all the adhesive off before using a new one helps but the bandaid brand adhesive always does this too me.Generics adhesive causes the rash right away.Curad doesn't give me a rash but I have a hard time finding their brand with the fabric bandages

  What can I say, I’m a kindergarten teacher. I bring a box of these to my class every month. The kids know they may have one if they have a boo boo. Sometimes there is blood to cover, but usually it’s a hurt feelings, or missing a grown up. I don’t ask them to show me their injuries, because some can’t be seen. They don’t hurt too much to take off, and a thorough hand washing wipes them out. But it’s worth the investment to patch up broken hearts.

  Momma, Poppa and Baby sizeNice quality bandaids. I usually don't shop name brands. For Bandaids I do. When I need a bandaid that will do its job I only use Band-Aid.I once met someone tell me that they had an open cut on their finger and ended up in the hospital because they used a cheap bandaid. I asked them what they meant by that and they said that an infection began to brew in their finger from it not being properly protected. They had to be hospitalized and pumped with antibiotics for several days before they could go home. Stories like this scare me because you could have a little cut on your finger, but if you don't protect it and you touch the wrong thing, you can get an infection that can kill you. From now on I'm very careful about any cuts on my hands or body and protect my skin (especially after I heard that story).

  I needed several bandages of various sizes for several profusely bleeding cuts and this fit the bill. They stayed on well, protected the cuts and maintained the healing products I used on them. I am happy to say the cuts and abrasions are clean and almost completely healed. I really appreciated the various sizes. They became damp sometimes but stayed in place. The container has an honored site in my cabinet.  Thank you Amazon.

  These band-aids have wonderful grip. Even with frequent hand-washing, the adhesive didn't falter. I specifically bought these because I needed good bandages that had padding all the way to edge instead of an island surrounded by adhesive. These were perfect. And the padding never stuck to my burn as it healed, either. Very happy with this purchase.

  The box did not have any kind of seal or tape and band aids were almost spilling out. Many band aids were crumpled like they were stuffed to stay inside the box!!

  These have great adhesion, yet can be removed without taking skin with it. Can't say the same at all for their ""Tough Strip"" variety. (Use caution with those!)I keep these bandaids on for up to a week without changing, so long as I don't get them soaked. Even then they stay on for a couple days. Their longevity is shorter if used on a finger that's frequently involved with running water.I like the ""assorted sizes"" option and find this provides a reasonable quantity of the 3 sizes.  If you don't frequently use the 5/8"" and 3/4"" you're better off with the Flexible Fabric 100 ct of the 1""x3"".

",5.0,Cowboy,"Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  These Band-Aid brand bandages are far superior to cheapo dollar store bandages.  You also can't beat the deal of 100 bandages for under $7 delivered via Prime.  Sure, they won't arrive in time if you are beading profusely and need one now, but this is a great item to order if you are anything like my family who goes through bandages frequently due to cut fingers and skinned knees.  We always keep a supply on hand.The thing I like about these is they adhere better than cheapo bandages.  They also breathe better than those plastic bandages that turn your skin white if worn more than a couple of hours.  This is one of those products where it is better to buy a name brand than waste money on a off-brand bandage that won't stay on.

  Excellent bandages.  Fabric with high flexibility.  Bandage pad has non-stick film.  Bandage adheres to itself tenaciously - has to be cut off.  Sticks to skin tightly, but not too tightly. Three sizes - small, medium, and large.  I use bandaids mostly for finger cuts and the medium size works best for adult fingers.  I don't have much use for the small size (which are the most abundant), but the the small size is probably targeted for smaller kid's fingers. For those of us who don't have kids around, the small size probably won't be used much before the larger sizes are used up.  But, still, a good value for an assortment.

  I clean pools and from time to time during the winter and filter cleaning season I get a few scrapes and bumps and sometimes this causes bleeding. I really like to refill my first aid kit because it helps a lot not to spill blood everywhere while I'm on the job. I recently got this to refill some of the older bandaids I purchased from my Costco bundle hoping that these be the same quality, but they are not that water resistant at all like the previous time I purchase. The Band-Aids have just slipped off and the adhesion is either really poor or these are old and expired Band-Aids. Can't really knock on the brand because this is always been my go-to brand but if you're near water or are going to be around a lot of water I definitely recommend going different route then this type of Band-Aid for coming up small cuts.

  As an EMT, I've dealt with many different types and brands of self adhesive bandages. These are by far the most durable. With their tough fabric backing, and an ample amount of adhesive, these bandages will simply not fail you. Their perfect for everything from every day use, to backpacking trips into the great outdoors. Although they lack water resistance, their ability to cling to cuts under almost any circumstance, more than makes up for it. Sweat, dirt, skin hair and hard use are no match for these Band-aid brand flexible fabric masterpieces.

  Regular BandAids have their place, and are great. Sometimes fabric is better, and I really like these. They are super sticky, and conform to non-standard surfaces. Great for toes, for example, because you can stretch them, and they stick like crazy, and don't come off inside your sock. They are somewhat harder to remove because of the strong adhesive, and I usually end up using scissors to cut them off if they are wrapped around something like a finger. Being fabric, they are not at all waterproof, and I would not expect them to be. But I've showered with them, and they stick well in the water - but of course the fabric gets soaked.

    Allergic to Adhesive used
  
",2.0,divefan,"Reviewed in the United States December 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've used Band-Aid brand for many years and like the flexible fabric ones.  This brand has been one of the few where the adhesive did not give me a rash.  As I'm always needing some size, I thought this large box and selection would be good to have in my first aid arsenal.  However, the first use on my arm caused a reaction and made the area where attached red, itchy and painful.  It took a day after removing for the swelling and redness to go down.  These are made in China, so not sure if they have changed their adhesive or manufacturing process.  I plan to check the local stores to see if they are also made in China.  If so, looks like I'll be shopping for a new brand.  Disappointed.  On the upside, it's a good selection of sizes if you can tolerate the adhesive used.

  The Band-aids may be fine. But Amazon stuffed this little band-aid carton into a large shipping box with something quite heavy. In the shipment, the heavy item banged around over the band-aid carton. When I opened the shipping box, the band-aids kind of exploded, falling all over the floor and table. What a chore to crawl around finding all the band-aids, sorting them out by size, and trying to get them into the badly crinkled carton where they belonged...

  Title says most of what needs to be said.  Other than that, they aren't quite cheapo bandages, but they aren't more than... well... a band aid. If you're looking to waterproof a wound or be able to wash your hands with your bandage on, find a more premium bandage.  These are great for little nicks and cuts that can get infected or take longer to heal if exposed and rubbed on things, like fingers or hands, but they will need to be changed frequently.

IMO, these are the best that I have tried.  They stick to my skin and to themselves while protecting the wound.  That's exactly what I think bandaids are for. Unfortunately, they have the new thinner gauze pad, but I would still buy them again.

  I love these band-aids! I bought them a few months ago because the bandages that came in my first aid kit were running low. I didn’t have super high expectations, but I am beyond impressed with their quality.I accidentally cut myself shaving in the shower the other night. When I got out, I put on a bandage. And then forgot about it, which is unheard of for me because I have very sensitive skin and even in the teeny-tiniest little tag will drive me crazy. And THEN, three days later after two additional showers, the bandage was still there!!! I’ll admit it was a bit ratty, but I’ve never had a bandaid make it through one shower before, let alone two.I am very, very happy with this purchase and will absolutely continue to buy these after my current box runs out.

(no i'm not diabetic)... i was using cheapy Band-Aids before these and in comparison these are great! i wear them at night because that's longest stretch of time that i go without wetting my hands.  These do come off easily if i wet my hands... because i'm always washing them, and agitating soap ... but i'm sure these are fine if you wear them elsewhere... the Band-Aid is fabric like material... its stretchy but doesn't compromise the adhesion which is great! i love these.

  These are basically the only band-aids I ever use, and I use a LOT because I'm always getting cuts and insect bites in the summer.  They are incredibly tough and flexible, and will stay on for a week, even in the shower, seriously!  They are not waterproof at all, but that's the trade-off for comfort and durability.  However, water-proof band-aids are not great for healing anyway,the skin needs to breathe.

  This same package sells for $10.98 in major drug stores like RiteAid and Walgreens. I like that the pad is as wide as the fabric. Other Bandaids and bandages fool you with tiny pads that are a quarter the size of bandage. These however do not hold up to showers or swimming. if you expect to go swimming or want to extended life, wrap them with NexCare's waterproof tape.

",5.0,Katie K,"Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2017","









  
  
    
  Flexible fabric Band-Aids are the only Band-Aids I will buy anymore. They are the best out there if you want a Band-Aid that stays on. I get a lot of cuts on my fingers and most Band-Aids cannot handle being near a joint. They can't flex and move with the skin so they get loose and fall off and that allows bacteria to get in. These flexible fabric Band-Aids are a different breed though. They hang on, even around a knuckle. After a thorough washing and drying of the cut, I apply a dab of Neosporin, put the Band-Aid on and let my body take care of the rest. After couple days (a maybe a couple reapplications depending on how dirty I get my hands), the wound is almost completely healed.

  Hubby had minor surgery and needed a band-aid twice a day for almost a month.  I couldn't go wrong with this bargain-price for the real 'McCoy band-aid.  We've missed so much over the years buying the crappy generic.  These were perfect.  All different sizes, covered very well and kept clean.  May never go back to generic again!

  It's nice to know that you have a source that handles these band-aids in large quantities.  I love the flexible fabric type because once you put it on, it's hard to remove, and I like that.  The 3/4 inch size is almost impossible to find in the stores, so I hope they will continue to be in stock at Amazon.  I do a lot of crafting and use a scissors for hours sometimes.

  These band aids are horrible. They are almost impossible to remove from wrappers. When I tear the wrapper open the bandage tears with it. Even if the bandage doesn’t tear it sticks to the wrapper. Their so difficult I threw them away.

  Better than store brand generic bandages. Biggest difference being the larger gauze/cloth area that doesn't stick to wounds and a better adhesive.

  I have tried other brands of band aids and always come back to the Band-Aid Brand. This is a nice assortment of various sizes and you can't go wrong with the flexible fabric style IMO. Good price too for a lot of band aids if you're looking to shore up your first aid supplies.

  The pouch is a nice durable ripstop Cordura nylon and the zipper pull has an added nylon strap pull attached to make opening easier. It seems to be a great deal because the bandages alone would be worth the price, so basically, you get a nice red storage pouch for free!

  These are very flexible and comfortable.  They bend with fingers, knees, etc.  I think they are more comfortable than ""regular"" Bandaids.  I gave them  three stars for water resistance because when I washed my hands, they soaked up the water.

  I rarely use bandaids, but when I do it’s important. These are my go to as they are flexible, stay on (even in awkward locations such as fingertips), breathe well and come off easily when time to remove. Great for use as a butterfly, helping me maintain never having to be stitched up.

  Been using these band-aids for a while and the only issue we have is that it's not as water resistant as we would like for them to be. But they do the job they're supposed to when you don't come into contact with a ton of water.
