    It’s so simple to use, great quality at an affordable price
  
",5.0,David Borja,"Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  The installation is super easy, just peel and stick. However, note that you can’t connect strips together if you buy two separate strips. The set up was easy as well, they provide a booklet with instructions. At first, I thought the music syncing wasn’t working, but figured out that you just have to play the music loud enough for it to sync. I just played with the volume on a speaker until was at a good volume and the lights were able to sync. With that note, you can only use music sync if you’re playing music out loud. Overall, very satisfied with the product, but wish it came in lengths longer than 30ft.

  Easy to set up, adhesive is a bit tricky it will come off with the backing if not careful. So far I have had no complaints with these lights I used them on the back of a round mirror and created my own “ring light.” Love all the features you can play with on the app. Only issue is it’s been turning on by itself, noticed it last night and then today when I got home from work.

  Honestly the LED strips are pretty cool. I bought these because I wanted to have white LED strips around my mirror. After playing with the remote and using the app for the strips. I still couldn’t find the correct color white for the strips.I even played around with the warmth of the white and still no luck. It comes out as a light blue color and I really dont like that tbh. Every other color was pretty cool, but the white color wasn’t that great.

  AMAZING. I currently have the Philips hue strip which is $80 and was not so impressed by so getting this one I was not expecting much. I could not be so wrong. First off, very bright. It came with clear instructions and a kit  which includes alcohol pad to clean the surface and press on plastic hooks to run the wire after the strip. This item was able to run all around my 75 inch tv easily. After setting it up and connecting it to my phone and alexa and google assistant all works flawlessly. It even has music mode which really does go with the beat. The adhesive was perfect. Sticks right away so becareful placing first time. All of this waa opposite for the brand name and triple the price.

    Good: bright and vibrant. However, warning label placed on strip is a problem
  
",4.0,Marilyn Velazquez ,"Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  I love the lights! Nice and vibrant colors and had no problem hooking them up with Alexa. However, the reason I gave it 4/5 was the really inconvenient placement of the warning sticker. Wrapped tightly around the first cuttable area around the strip, I damaged my strip trying to take it off. At first I didn’t realized it was there when trying to install it, and the sticker was placed so tight that the adhesive protection ripped off at the warning sticker. On the contrary Govee was very understandable and gave me a replacement due to the warranty. I bought 2 and I’m going to buy more. I just really wish they put the warning sticker somewhere off the strip..

  Super cute i loveee them. they’re the perfect length to cover my wall across the top and down the side. they’re also very bright and have many different colors. my only problem with them is they don’t have orange or yellow. there is an orange and yellow button on the app, but the color shows up green for both. it’s ok, they look best on the red and blue settings best anyway. The light also doesn’t match the music perfectly if you have it on the music setting, but they look better not flashing to me anyways (:

  I must admit, I've never heard of this company before and decided to take a risk with them (I usually go with Philips Hue) and boy was it worth it!Definitely the best bang for your buck. Before ordering, I was worried that the adhesive tape was going to be weak.. then I thought it was going to be really weak when I saw that it came with little support pieces to help tape the lights. BUT, the adhesive on its own is super strong and sturdy!I have it linked to my Google mini and it works like a charm, no problems at all.Additionally, the music-light ""combo"" is one of the best ive experienced. It picks up sound really well and the lights change colors/brightness almost perfectly in sync.First picture is with only the strip light on on max brightness (quite bright actually), and the second picture is the light on the same brightness level, but with one lamp light turned on.Excellent product!

  Bought these back in December, work great, the adhesive is strong and their bright. The app is easy to setup, same with linking it to Alexa. I did have an issue where a section of lights stopped working. The solder between two contacts failed. I contacted Govee, sent them pictures and my order number, and they replaced them at no charge, and they did so on their own, without me having to ask. Great product and amazing customer service.

",4.0,Robert Poplin,"Reviewed in the United States January 25, 2021","









  
  
    
  These look fantastic and have really helped set off my office/gaming room.  I actually prefer to leave the lights off now because they look so good in the dark.  There is a slight problem with adhesion that causes the strips to slough off every now and then, but it's nothing that some additional tape couldn't fix.  If you're looking for good quality LED strips this is what you're looking for.

  Purchased this item for my son and came in two strips which are obviously not the same product as one strip of lights is smaller than the other and one is brighter than the other and you can tell when the lights are on which he had them on majority of the time. For the price of these lights I’m very disappointed in this purchase. If the product was the same then we would be satisfied but they aren’t.

  I am loving these lights! I was looking for rope lighting with a remote and these LED strip lights come up. I had no experience with those and was skeptical when the tiny box arrived. I placed them above my cabinets, but didn't want to attach them until I verified they would meet my expectations. They have FAR exceeded my expectations! They look great just thrown above the cabinets, so I'm going to leave them unattached. I know they won't last forever, so this way they will be easily replaced and I will buy the same set again and again (as long as they last at least six months).I can't believe how many great features these lights have. The remote on my iPhone works great, but my favorite feature is using it with Alexa. I didn't think I even needed that until I set it up and now I'm so happy I picked this model. It's so cool! I was initially worried about the brightness, but no need, they are very bright (if you want them to be). I was also worried about the reviewer comment that the white is a cool white, almost blue, but he clearly didn't look closely at the app. You can adjust the coolness from completely soft warm white to bright cool white. You can get the exact color you want. I am having so much fun with these and looking around my house to find other places for these awesome lights!

  I'd always wanted to get LED backlights for my TV, but never took the leap due to cost. With pricing at an all time low, and being stuck at home with the quarantine, I finally opted to buy. I choose this model, since it supported a Smart App and Alexa control. The included remote can be adhered to any surface with the 3M tape, but I opted to just leave mine loosely on my Media Cabinet. The install was relatively simple, and had more than enough length to cover a 55"" TV with plenty to spare. Thankfully, you can cut these down for optimal fit. They're fairly bright, and with the RGB controls in the app, you can set this to almost any color of your choosing.You're also able to give the lights a custom name in the app to distinguish any other lights you have installed using the same app. Honestly, I liked these so much I purchased a car lighting kit from the same company. It all works in the same app; which also works really well!Really happy with the easy install, the instructions are fairly easy to follow, and the features make this a great recommendation.

  So let me just start off by saying everything was really great about about this product for about a month. I was really happy until about three of the LEDs went out and stopped working. I am really disappointed with this product and will be contacting customer service.

They were very professional and great customer service and a day later a replacement product was shipped! Love this product and customer service I would definitely recommend this product or any other product from this company.

  I'm turning my house into a smart home, and of course LED back lighting on a TV is a must. Originally I was going to go with Philip's hue, but after a lot of research I stumbled upon these. My biggest concern was price. I would have needed 2 sets of the Philip's hue to do my 65in TV. At $80 a pop, that's $160! So, these were 1/4 the price. My other main concern was Compatibility with my other smart devices. 10/10 again for Compatibility. Had it synced and connected to my google home in less than 2 minutes.

  LIKES: It is bright bright bright. Amazingly bright colors and whites. Soft white and blue white lights. That is a plus. My niece loves it because she can turn on some music and the lights dances.DISLIKES: Adhesion is okay, we had to use additional 3M tape to keep it in place. I should not have to do that.Also, four of the light diodes do not light up anymore. Three of the light diodes, when the unit is off, stays on (very very very low, but in a dark room, you can see the three lights still being on except for being completely dark).Sometimes it appears that it does not respond to voice commands or routines. So I say, turn Strip 1 on. Alexa says OK. It does not come on. I say it again and it comes on. It appears to go into sleep mode or something. Sometimes the routines don't fire on command. The WIFI router is about 10 feet away. I have a WIFI bulb that is over 100 feet away and it has no issues at all.My next purchase of light strips will be Zigbee because it will work with Smartthings. Govee is very bright and the colors are amazing. Just needs work on being more reliable. Three stars. I hope Govee improves on it a little better because it is the brightest light strip for the cost. The cost is amazing as well. Just needs a little more improvement.

  Great concept. Adheres well. Like the remote function (via phone). Able to control brightness and (infinite) color selection. Sub-standard technology.  This is our 2nd order for the single strip due to LEDs failing. The 1st strip, a section of 3 lights failed (blue color, but effects many other colors). Amazon worked with me even though the failure occurred after the 30-day warranty. The 2nd (replacement) strip failed also, but in multiple sections. Again, after the 30-day warranty period. The 2-strip product works, but we've had 2 strikes on the single strip product.  Not trying for strike 3. Wasted money. Go with a different brand...

   I divided the strip into three pairs to go over my two windows and behind my TV in my studio. Using just the controller just gives basic RGB settings. The App through Bluetooth and Alexa step up the game with this low cost roll. It has its own power supply and is easy to divide the strip with additional connectors. A great way to extend between strips is 4 wire telephone line. Solid strand and well enough connectivity for the low wattage needed to run the strips. Being solid strand also makes for easy quick soldering if you choose to go with out the connector kits. The white is almost daylight but not too bright. There are brighter strips out there but cost much more than these. I mounted the strip pairs on 36"" square plastic tubes that were left over from my deck remodel. If you apply the strips to anything other than a good heat sink, like most led strips,  you will loose some leds. The easiest cheapest way is to buy a roll of Aluminum stove pipe tape. I have a Light fixture I made in my garage that has been permanently on for 3 years with that method and not one lost LED so far. So whatever you mount the strips to,if not Aluminum,  mount the foil tape first and you can thank me later by checking out my YouTube channel. Tejas Auto Salon

  These are hands down the best LED strips. Adhesion is 3M and works like a charm but also not immediate if you do need to adjust upon first setting up. I love that I can cut them to the desired length! We have them in the living room behind the TV, and under our bed! My only wish is that I was able to buy a separate battery pack with the remote to attach to the left over strip. They do say on their site that they want you to buy the length you need but even the smallest length i could make into two projects! The app is easy to use and i’ll def be buying more of their stuff in the future.

    Love These
  
",5.0,R. Campbell,"Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  We stuck these to the bed frame of my son's twin bed so they shine down on the floor essentially backlighting his bed and creating a soft glow in the room.  Had no trouble connecting them to his echo dot and he likes to have them on while he falls asleep.  I think it's fun to put them on the ""dance to the music beat"" mode so they flicker with the beat of whatever music is playing in the room.  They can be hundreds of different colors and the app is easy to use on iPhone.

  Does not work as advertised. They are lights that change color, best used with the hand remote (a different product). The “Alexa” version needs an app downloaded that requires a verified email. It does not work with Alexa or any smart home device. Your giving away your email in addition to the16$ For a strip of leds.

  I ordered these lights a few weeks ago- I initially loved them and decided that I wanted to add more to my home so I ordered another. Unfortunately, when I plugged them in the lights did not work. I returned them and asked for an even exchange. The second order came in tonight and the lights were also defective. Pretty disappointing- I really enjoyed the first set that I got. I contacted their support through the app to see if they might have a fix.UPDATE: Their support was able to resolve the issue and the lights are now working perfectly. Both strands look amazing in my home!

  These lights are mediocre in my personal opinion. They are not Hue lights and the colors are not as vibrant but they still look good. Major issue for me is I don’t believe they can work with HomeKit and Siri. I have not done much research on it but as I have tried to pair in Home app it does not connect so I have to make sure I am connected to my 2.4 network (which I never am cause who wants slow speeds) go into the Govee app and manually Tuen off the lights. It made me rate the remote. I had to double check the box for a remote until I realized the little fob connected to the actual strip is considered the remote. The “remote” is garbage it is wired to the actual strip and is useless unless your strip is going to be within three feet, if that, of where you plan to turn off the lights. They did look good though but for 25$ I would expect them to do a little more.

  Very easy to install, but after less than 2 months my lights began to have issues connecting to the app and connecting with my Amazon Alexa (which allows voice commands). There is also a section of the LEDs that doesn’t match the rest, I will change the color and only a small section changes to the correct color while the remaining 90% of LEDs change to a random color. I would recommend buying a different brand that is more reliable.

  This thing is perfect for what it is. Good adhesion and more than enough length to cover a big square behind my 65"" Samsung Q70R. Good brightness behind the TV, even in the daytime (though obviously not going to light up a bright room). App is fairly easy to use with decent customization options. I just wish it worked with Apple Homekit, but it does not. Remembers last settings even if you just want to use the attached power button and not open the app every time. You will need the app though to get the lighting you want as the attached buttons are extremely limited. Would consider buying for other projects. Thanks.

  Does not specify that you can't add on the length, so i bought a few boxes to get the desired length i need but the power supply doesn't give enough power to end run. It is bright at the beginning but towards the middle to the end the brightness goes way down.I tried to search if you sell just the power supply to upgrade it and there is nothing, why i don't know why you can't buy or sell these upgrades. Even with the led strips, you sell these items separately to add to your length or boost the power supply.So obviously i'm not going to take it down and return it, cause i'm not that type of consumer that would send it back like that, so i will have do my research unless i get a positive feedback from Govee.

  If you are looking for RGB light strips that wont break the bank then you are on the right product page. Most light strips that i have purchased in this price range has been a disappointment and nothing more that glorified Christmas lights. I purchased these for my sons room as a birthday gift for under the bed glow and due to the promise of Google home integration. I thought the integration would just be a weak on off function but that was all I really needed so he would have a cool night light that can turn on and off at set times. After installation of the application I was totally surprised at how much these lights were capable of. The app is easy to use but the integration with Google assistant was far more than just a simple on/off. The connection allows for color recognition which works great with all my Phillips Hue RGB bulbs. The 3m tape adheres great but that will be a test of time. In an effort to help that processes this kit comes with screw held claps to add additional support in fail areas. The area where this kit could do better is color accuracy, example you ask for pink you get light red-orange. This is definitely not a deal breaker at this price point. Not only did I buy one but I ended up picking up 2 more with the plan to buy more. Great buy!

  The adhesion strips are really good. Unfortunately, the connector strip that you connect the power to is REALLY fragile. Installed on my tv with the help of 3 people and the connector still tore when trying to connect it to the power supply. Now the strip is fully stuck on the back of my tv with no power... frustrating but it happens to the best of us. I’d say the lights are strong cus I almost got a seizure when they made false contact and flickered on and off a few times. So, if you’re not unlucky enough to break the flimsy connector piece, I’m sure these will work for you, just don’t ever plan to disconnect them straight from the strip without rolling the dice.

   I can't say enough good things about this LED strip.  I am extremely picky & can assure you I am very happy with this product. Im not a paid reviewer and actually don't leave reviews often. But this light strip is absolutely worth the $. I cannot think of any cons, so here are some pros:•• Long enough for a 75"" LG TV ••I originally put the lights much closer to the edge, and it didn't make it fully around the tv, so I adjusted until it and it fits perfectly. About 1"" from the edge should work. To make it around the corners I simply folded the strip in a spot that wasn't 'stiff' with a light, but the flexible part between lights. (see back of photo TV for detail)•• Very bright lights ••Even with the strip being 1"" off the edge of the TV, you can very much see the color reflection on the wall & around the TV itself.•• The color options / settings are so much fun ••I have this programmed to the Alexa and was able to change the color, motion of lights & opacity. Its fun to watch it motion with the beat of the music too! (can also be a little nauseating lol)•• Smart app / speaker friendly ••You can program this to your smart devices, set a timer & fully control from the app on your phone.•• Smart app is wonderful!!! ••The app is extremely colorful & bright. It's easy to use & all you have to do for setup is know your product #. See photos for the iOS app.

",3.0,D. Murphy,"Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  Wifi offers limited functionality unlike the other led light strips I have.  In order to get full function I have to connect to Bluetooth which is inconvenient as I am often out of range.  Also, the Bluetooth connection for one of the two strips stopped working until I reset the light strip.  If I have any other problem they are going back.

  Just doesn’t work, super unreliable, more Chinese crap amazon listed as “amazons choice” that low quality.  Alexa is also to blame as it says things like “I have multiple devices named that” which is just not correct.  Getting a tired of Amazon shotgunning Alexa products and too many of them have zero reliability.  Slow down with releases if you can’t keep quality high.

  This product is awesome for someone looking to add a little bit of ‘life’ to their workout room! I tossed these under my Peloton mat and stuck the remote on the wall, for easy access from the bike. Took less than 5 minutes. I also like that there is a setting that will pulse with the music from my bike. I didn’t stick the adhesive to the mat just because we move frequently and I don’t want to have to buy a new set of lights every time we relocate; simply laying them under the mat seemed to work wonderfully. Would highly recommend!

  These were working for a couple months but now, I’m lucky to make it through 1 single day without these disconnecting from WiFi. I have three of these light strips, all have the same WiFi connection problem. The only devices that I have internet issues with. I’ve also had Govee light bulbs that had the same WiFi issues, I had to stop using those because of the WiFi issues. I prefer to just leave these turned off rather than fight with their network issues on a daily basis. Waste of money.

  I bought this to put on top of my kitchen cabinets, but it's not quite bright enough for what I'm wanting. I'm trying to achieve a level of brightness that I could easily perform morning tasks... making coffee, etc... and they just didn't get to that level. Plus the white is really light blue. I'm trying to get more of a true white and a brighter effect. However, these lights rock under my bed. I originally placed them with some scotch tape to see how they were going to work and just fully adhered them today. So, not too sure on the longevity of the adhesion. I didn't put clips on it at this point. If I start to get drop gaps, I'll add clips to those points. Pictures included of some of the main colors. If you add this into Google Home, you have 42 present colors to choose from through the app. If you use the Govee app, you can use the color wheel.

    Perfect LED for mounted TVs
  
",5.0,Bhavesh Patel,"Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  The Govee LED lights are the way to go when looking for LED lighting for your home. Especially if it’s for back of your TV setup. It was not terribly hard to spread and stick the light strip behind my 75” TV. I purchased the 16.4 foot one which is plenty for up to 75” TVs. It would be easier if you do this first before mounting but it can be done regardless with careful consideration. Once applied, the lights turned on right away and showed you that they are working/connected. The pins and connector appear fragile but once connected hold a steady plug. Finally, the setup was a breeze with their app. Now I can control a variety of lights and “moods” which is amazing. Looks outrageous in the night. The brightness is perfect for a mounted TV setup. Excellent so far and happy with my purchase.

    Good for the money but some of the colors are whacko
  
",3.0,Daniel,"Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2019","









  
  
    
  There’s seems to be a few versions of this strip. Mine was the version with no remote but instead used the app and Alexa to control itThe good:- Bright LEDs- Vibrant colors- Easy to set up- Easy to add to Alexa- Syncs up well with music- Has an app- Can be cut shorterThe Bad:- some of the colors aren’t even close to what other light strips (including their own DreamColor strips) would show. Orange comes out as yellowish green, Warm White is straight up yellow, etc. I think this is the biggest downfall as it’s impossible to get Alexa to match it with the Hue lights since none of the colors in the yellowish range are accurate- the color selector in the app is far inferior to that of Hue’s but obviously this is cheaper- some of the color requests Alexa sends it cannot understand and will just turn whiteI own this and one of their DreamColor strips (with no Alexa). I think next time I’ll be spending the extra money to get the Alexa DreamColor one as it seems to have better color accuracy

  If you’re looking for an LED light strip that integrates with your existing smart home devices such as SmartThings, this isn’t it.

I tried all of their suggestions, including renaming my 2.4 ghz SSID to no avail.  Plus. I made the rookie mistake of installing the light strip so now I have to disassemble it and send it back.

  Great product overall. Love the app controls. Deducted one star because I bought two rolls for my built-in shelves, only to discover that there was an inconsistency in the colors of the two- one strip was more greenish on the warm white mode. Very slight, but noticeable enough that I had to get crafty and use all of one strip to maintain the consistent color and ended up only using the controller from the second roll. That fixed it. Work well with solderless connectors and a splitter so far.

  Lights work as advertised. I’ve had a couple strips of govee and I was really excited to use them, but I’m kinda disappointed because these lights are half as bright as the last pair I had. The only differences I notice are: the last pair were not connected to Alexa/Google and these lights are far thinner than the previous material used. They feel like cardboard paper thin whereas the lights I got last time were thick, durable, and had a plastic type coating around the LED side (these do not, which is concerning because eventually the moisture from a hot environment will affect the product).

  I've had this product since January. The install was incredibly easy and the adhesive never gave me any issues even though I have a textured wall. The music mode was very reactive. However, the color mixing could use some adjustments. Some colors definitely do not match. Unfortunately, after a few months of regular use, the blue light seem to have gone out completely. This is a problem because blue is used to mix the other colors therefore skewing the other colors as well. Would've expected these to last longer than a few months.Update: Worked with customer service to get a replacement for the defective product, excellent turnaround time and service!

  Relatively easy setup. Took some work to get it working with Alexa but after setup I haven't actually done any voice commands.  I don't have a reason to change colors. I just set a color we liked and let it be. It remembers the last color/brightness setting when it powers on which is great, as its plugged into the same smart strip as my TV which I turn off when not in use. The light strip was long enough to to almost go around the perimeter of the backside of the TV twice.Only thing I would like better is if it came with a physical wireless remote, in addition to having the Alexa/wireless integration and the attached remote on the base of the device.

  First, the lights themselves are very nice.  I have had no trouble with the light strip functionality.  They installed fine, connected  to the Govee app and to my phone via Bluetooth.  It's the app trying to connect to my wi-fi, which you need in order to be able to use the lights with Alexa that's the problem. The Govee app is okay when it comes to controlling the light strips, but really crappy when it comes to connecting.  It keeps telling me my wi-fi is not available and will not connect.  Even though I'm sitting right next to the router, have the correct wi-fi info, and have tried MANY times to connect.  It absolutely will NOT do it.  So, one of the major reason I bought these was to use with my Alexa device and now I can't.  Not very happy about this.

  I've been using this for about a week now. I have it installed underneath a white couch. The concept is really cool. I personally think they could be a bit brighter though. The real issue I'm having is that the app won't connect the device to my WiFi. Initially it did, and I got Alexa working and all that, but now for some reason it refuses to connect which means no more Alexa. Bluetooth still works. I've tried removing the device, adding it back, still nothing. Kinda disappointed. Other than that, shipping was quick, arrived in good condition, installation was pretty simple though I had one little mishap where I tried to take the paper covering off of the adhesive and I accidentally started peeling the actual adhesive strip off of the lights. One thing to note as far as installation goes, you will need to press kinda hard to make the lights stay where you want them to be. Anyway, when everything was working I was pretty happy with this product.

  I've always enjoyed the backlighting that some YouTubers who review technology products have for their sets. I wanted to apply that to my computer area and this product turned out great. The phone application is easy to use and not intrusive, and also gives you many effects to try out as well as just your standard colors. For the price, I'm very happy with it.However I've discovered one minor flaw; orange and yellow isn't accurate at all. Orange is yellow, and yellow is lime green. Rest of the color space seems accurate.

    Adjustable Music Mode works!
  
",4.0,Upgreydd,"Reviewed in the United States October 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've been trying out several different smart RGB/W lighting solutions in my rec room over the past several weeks. That being said, this was my first foray into led strips. My intention here  was to take down an existing fluorescent fixture  (connected to a smart switch) and inlay this into it and I must say, that after the fact I am  moderately to somewhat impressed with the results (which is more than I expected). I get pretty decent  illumination, depending on the color choice of course, and the diffuser panels I'm using (basic cracked glass look) actually make them look like legitimate lighting.One  of the things that I do dislike about them, is that the color pallet doesn't seem to quite match up to the rest of my trial brands, most notable in the white ranges (although I'm not sure that this set does true white), almost all colors are heavily ""blue washed"".Now, onto the real surprise ,at least in my opinion, .....  Use the Govee App and put it into Music mode!This is a feature that I really never knew I needed! It is pretty customizable, and most importantly, I effectively and accidentally found a 1/2 decent replacement for that once-sweet unsupported Rockband Stage Kit!!!But, onto the next thing I dislike... While the Google Home integration is pretty functional (and it has yet to drop wifi or connection to date),  in order to switch to music mode you'll have to reconnect to the lights via bluetooth through the app. It doesn't seem possible to have Google assistant do this at all, which is really too bad.  Although it is worth noting, that when you reconnect via bluetooth it does not break the wifi connection to my google home.Last noteworthy feature is the scenes. Most of the pre-programmed scenes are quite enjoyable, and the ability to add custom scenes works pretty well, however, there are two things here that could be improved upon. 1:) you can only have one custom scene, meaning you cannot save a custom scene for future use, 2:) just like music mode I cannot seem to find a way for Google to switch to, from, or set these. It has to be done via Bluetooth.Overall, I'm glad I made this purchase, for  roughly $25 I've converted an existing fixture to a smart RGB fixture, and found a few nice surprises along the way.Biggest room for improvements would include more features supported by Smart assistants, and integrating a more true white color pallet.

  I purchased these because I needed a light that would be bright enough to light my stairway, but also not blind me early in the morning or late at night. These have been perfect. I can control them easily with Alexa and with the Govee app.I’m giving the lights 4 stars because I think the length of the power cord needs to be longer. It makes installation tough for oddly placed outlets. It also would have been nice to have more support clips included for those that don’t want to use the adhesive backing. Other than those few gripes I love these lights and plan on buying more.

If I chose red, later down the line it became a whole different color. Additionally, the 16 million lightings just don’t work for me.

  These are really cool once you install them. But be sure and buy some double sided tape. We used gorilla tape. The adhesion of the tape on the lights is not adequate for underneath a wooden kitchen cabinet. It was easy to pair with Alexa. The luminescence is a very nice touch to the kitchen.

  The actual strips are pretty nice, I wish it didnt require such a huge box for power, its hard to hide for most of the places i'm using these strips.I have about 8 of these strips, and the biggest problem is lack of HomeKit.  So I have to buy a wemo outlet for each one to plug these into so I can use siri to control them turning on/off with my HomeKit scenes.  If they integrate HomeKit directly into them instead of lame alexa i'd buy a ton more and enthusiastically give these 5 stars.

  Just 15 days after installing it behind my desk 75% of the strip stopped working. As shown in the picture, just the little part behind the monitor is working, rest does not. There was no damages, no one even touched it or disturbed any of the wiring back there to even cause any movement to the strip - but it just stopped working on me. Unfortunately I installed it 17 days after purchase and I am outside the return window. I wrote to the seller and never got a reply. I have a LED strips from other brands which are flawlessly working for more than 3-4 years. This one lasted just 15 days, THE WORST PRODUCT I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON EVER.

  It’s all about the app, and this product has a terrible one. It requires Bluetooth connection to set up the WiFi, which is fine, but the Bluetooth connection drops over and over again even when my phone is in he’s from the device. Once I got it connected and added WiFi, then it kept dropping the Bluetooth connection. After an hour is setup, I can’t get this thing to work correctly. I can also see from the UI of the app that it’s not likely to be intuitive to use if I can get it to work.

",3.0,DJDDay,"Reviewed in the United States February 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  Had these for a few days.  Working somewhat OK, but they seem to drop from WiFi regularly - losing contact with Alexa (router is brand new Xfinity-provided Gigabit; lights are merely 20 feet from radio).  Their adhesion to my metal Ikea Jerker desk frame and laminated wood desk is excellent.  Brightness is good, and colors are vivid for the most part.  The Alexa integration is good, though it does not see ""scenes"" created in the Govee app, nor can it turn the lights into ""music"" mode where it senses sound.  Speaking of the app, the Govee app is horribly cluttered with adware, and it's not very intuitive (Govee needs a lesson from LIFX or Phillips Hue).  But for $29 and 16 feet of smart LED, you could do far worse.  The bottom line is, when they work - they're awesome.  But WiFi-connection reliability is an issue.  There's not even a way to update the firmware via the Govee app, so we're stuck with a single gen firmware that's ""meh"".

  These are fantastic! I ordered two and I used them to light up my display cases, and they worked perfectly. They were super easy to stick on and the app is both really easy and fun to use. There are lots of settings and colors to choose from, and syncing two strips together is easy as well. I also had no problems at all after cutting both strips. As long as you cut along the cut lines, there shouldn’t be any issues. Of course, you can’t use the rest of the strip that gets cut off. I saw that some people were confused by that in the comments, so just make sure you’re aware of that before you buy these.

  I bought the 5m version before it disappeared from this listing, model H6159, and the powersupply and controller are rated at 1.5A, instead of the 3A this page currently says.  Because of the low amperage, the LED's never got very bright.  These would be good as accent lights I guess, but I needed full room lighting instead of this.  Hopefully the 5050 LED's will be able to handle higher amperage, so I'm going to try with a different powersupply/controller.

  I was worried at the price point I purchased these at that they would be very cheap and not bright enough for my preferences...even while installing behind my TV they seemed a little dim. Once I had them installed and had the TV back closer to the wall, I was proven wrong and I am satisfied with them. They are paper-thin (since they aren't waterproof and don't have the cover) which I think is a bonus. If you're trying to get Alexa/Wi-Fi compatible LED strips for indoors at a price you probably won't find lower. The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because the after the 3rd connection with L-shaped extenders, the strip along the bottom of the TV furthest from the power/wifi connection is discolored slightly to a cooler (almost blue) color when it is set on white, like it isn't calibrated correctly...this may be the result of a faulty connection with the L shaped connectors I used but wanted to point it out as a potential concern for people using it the same way I am. All other colors look fine, just white has a more teal color at the end of the strip. Otherwise, go for it!

  The LED lights (H6159) were bought with the expectation to be controlled using Google Home. Following the instructions for setting up there were a couple of hiccups.One of the things is the Govee application (on Android at least)  was painstaking in connecting to the WiFi. After spending some considerable time and connecting to the network.And the second hiccup was that the model did not have a Google Home but only an Alexa version of installation available. Nevertheless, installed the lights and paired it with the Govee application.Next, went on to the Google home app to see if it was visible on the network and voila I was infact able to add it to the 'Home'.Fits really well for a Vizio 55"" if you tape it to the edges as shown and there is still some extra left.If only they were able to work off of USB power and able to sync to the scene on the television.

  This LED light strip works well under Amazon Alexa control. The lights have a wide range of color and brightness and work for a variety of applications in the home. The strips are also trimmable so they can fit in various areas and sizes of projects. There been many reports of issues with the Alexa control and I found it can take 24 to 48 hours after registering the device for the Alexa app to recognize and Enable to skill. Once the skill is available and activated, the lights work as expected. Additionally I’ve seen many reports of poor customer service and I have not found that with Govee at all. They have tried to contact me numerous times to make it right and help me with my issues. Once the skill is available and activated, the lights work as expected. They went out of their way to make me a satisfied customer. My previous review was sent immediately after it was installed and attempted to be controlled by Alexa but due to the skill issue not working, I was upset. All is better now. If you’re new to getting into LED strip lighting then using Govee products is an excellent choice And I look forward to using them in my business and personal applications in the future.

  The premise is simple, cut to length, attach the corner/T-shaped splitters with plastic connectors and adhere in your chosen place. Unfortunately, the enclosed connectors are labelled GRB+/BRG+ and the light tape is labelled RGB+. What this means functionally is that you will NEVER be able to get correct lighting/colors unless you use one continuous strip without ever using connectors. Which basically negates the purpose of the lighting tape.It adheres pretty well, which is a plus, but was also extremely easy to remove when I was sick and tired of the lights being whatever color they decided to be rather than the selected color (in this case bright white).I attempted  to download the app, but it was fairly dodgy looking so I didn't really want to risk getting malware/spyware/adware on my phone. Also very little in the way of support on the website.I would not purchase this brand again. I was trying to be economical and I think I will go with a major name brand that actuyally DOES work with Google Home in the future.

  This led strip is cool as it has different color changing options and also it’s beat sensitive. Adhesive is really good and installation is hassle free. Couple things to be noted that the led s are spaced apart which makes it little bit on the lesser bright side. apart from that we are happy with this purchase.

  I love the brightness and color varieties of the lights! The only thing I dislike is the music reaction option. Because it is with a microphone and not direct output of the music, it tends to be really sensitive and pick up other noise and react to that instead. But other than that amazing look, easy to install, and overall great for the price!

  Was looking for an inexpensive led light to back light my new 65” tv I had recently bought. Had trouble finding decent cheap kits, most had very little control or very little if any customization. These lights from Govee work perfectly! Easy to install, easy to link to app, easy to operate even without app. Great adhesion too. Very pleased, and less than $30 too!

    Doesn't match other brands of smart RGB lights
  
",3.0,Weezzer,"Reviewed in the United States July 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have a smart home with many different smart lights in it.  I have brands such as Philips Hue, LifeX and a few lesser known brands such as this Govee strip.  I connect them all to my google hub and am able to say ""Hey Google, Turn lights soft white"".  The problem I have with this strip is that other than (Red, blue and green), this strip doesn't match any of my other bulbs.  In the picture, you can see that I told google to turn lights ""Incandescent"" and the govee strip is almost blue.... This is definitely disappointing as even cheaper smart lights are able to match the colors of more well known brands such as Philips Hue.

  If I had to describe this light strip in one word, it would be amazing. I bought these lights to put all around under my desk and it fit perfectly all around. These lights have a lot of brightness, but can be changed in the app. It’s really easy to put anywhere you want, you just have to apply slowly to wherever you want. I really appreciate that it is controlled by an app, the app is really user-friendly and easy to get around. I like all the different diy color effects and that you have a color wheel to select the color you want. Definitely recommended.

  I ordered the Govee Smart LED Strip Lights (16.4ft WiFi LED Lights Work with Alexa) and got it up and working easily.  After a week or two the Wifi and Bluetooth connections became unreliable but I was able to report the problem through the app.  The response reps suggested some troubleshooting and problem resolution steps which didn't work and they sent a replacement which was shipped promptly.  The replacement works well and I'm happy with the LED lights.  Hopefully the replacement stays stable and right now I'm happy with the product.

  Everything about the light strip is great, except for one thing. The cable for the power brick is too short, it should’ve been 10ft long to make it easier to put on the wall, without having to worry about it pulling down the remote on the wall. This was really dumb of the manufacturer to not do anything about this. Thankfully I had 3M cable clips to use as reinforcement.

  Lights came a day after projected arrival date but that is no big deal for me at all. The lights came in a nice box packaged carefully. Very easy installation. Took me maybe 15-20mins to go around the back side of my TV. Every light works and is extremely bright. I turned the brightness down via the app which also works great. I have no issues so far and would recommend this to anyone else looking to spice their room/living area up!

  I liked the idea of the different modes and connectivity with the app. I HATE that the music mode doesn’t work barely at all. I have to have the speaker playing directly next to the microphone that picks up the sound and even then it hardly works. It only responds to physical taps and touches and that’s when the “sound” pick up seems to work. Overall, I’m a bit disappointed.

  I purchased this product about 2-3 days ago, received it fairly quick. Packaging was simple and easy to open. Product came with everything it needed to come with. Installing the lights was also fairly easy, the only difficult part I had was removing the paper off the adhesive. (LOL)Now, I’m rating it a 3 out of 5 simply because it advertised that these lights would connect to Alexa and I’m personally not getting that experience. It’s a bit disappointing because that was the whole reason why I purchased these rather then the other lights I saw but on the upside I am still able to modify and change the colors through an application that they offer which you’ll find in the little manual it comes with.

    Great Budget RGB Lights, but Music Mode is Worthless

  Really enjoy everything about these lights, the setup was easy, pairing on the app was a breeze, although I would prefer you didn't have to make an account. The one problem I have is the music mode. I was expecting the lights to pulse or change color with the music, but they just flash randomly when in music mode, not to the beat or anything, just randomly. While that is quite the let down, if you want a good budget RGB light strip to add some cool atmosphere to a room, this product is a great choice, just don't expect anything from music mode

Other colors like pink, orange, and purple aren't quite so accurate. they are very bright when the room isn't indirect daylight and the app is fairly responsive. In order to make this work with Alexa you MUST install the ""skill"" within the Alexa app prior to discovering this. Requires a Bluetooth connection for the initial set up but works great.

  This is a fantastic product when left uncut. I installed two of these. One was on top of the kitchen cabinets and left untouched. It worked flawlessly. Before purchasing i watch several youtube videos for installation and recommendation. I had some cut to make on the underneath cabinets and bought 4 pin connectors. These can be a bit tricky and required a lot of finessing to get all of the colors to light back up after the first cut. Overall took some effort and patience. I would still buy these in a heartbeat. The connectors from iCreating worked best. I could not get the connectors with the gap extension from the SUPERNIGHT store to work.

  I purchased 4 of these, the only colors they can reliably produce is Red and Green, even the ""whites"" from 2700K-5000K are a sickening green tinted abomination, and Blue just straight out does not work on ANY of the 4 strips I purchased.  App software is up to date, firmware on the strips is up to date and they're garbage.  Spend the extra money for a quality RGB strip. And you need yet another app on your phone for setup, then linking to any ""smart home hub"" (our definitions of smart home may vary here, I consider this a connected home device, not a smart device.)I wanted to be able to cycle between various colors for my desk and under bed lights as well as offering some toe kick lighting under my bed when I get up at night to use the bathroom that wasn't some obnoxious color (like Red or Green or Blue, I wanted around a 2700K warm white light, maybe even 2200K if they supported it.)I now have to remove the old tape and replace it with something better (Let's face it, I'm probably gonna bit the bullet and have my boss order me some high-quality RGB tape light that's ridiculously overpriced for the environment it'll be in, but at least I know it'll be trouble-free and it'll just work, even if I upgrade down the line to an actual smart home control system.

It's just so bad it's impossible to justify keeping this product.As a comparison, the Feit Electric strip that I bought previously from Costco is amazing.

  Very disappointed that mine basically snapped in half because the rubber of the strip is not strong enough that even while reattaching it broke , and I can’t figure out if it can be rejoined, holding the two pieces together doesn’t make it broken half work at all

  I purchased the less expensive model and had to exchange for this one because my LG Smart TV remote interfered with the other set from day 1.Bottom line: I’m glad I did. The app works flawlessly with the lights. Of course it’s been mentioned that they’re very bright, but you can adjust the intensity level on this model. Additionally, they seemed to have a very strong adhesive that worked extremely well after having cleaned the back of my tv thoroughly with alcohol. I think they will be easy enough to remove if wanted, because of the way the adhesive is attached to the strips (it’s almost like double-sided tape).

    Great light with Alexa integration!
  
",5.0,basscow,"Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2019","









  
  
    
  This led light strip was exactly what I was looking for. It was long enough to go around all 4 edges of my 65 inch tv and have extra which I cut off. Powered it on and the setup with Alexa only took a few minutes. It's nice and bright and really made my setup pop. Highly recommend this light strip.Installation tip:Lay out the light strip ahead of time on the tv. Use scotch tape to tape it down at the corners and the middle of each of the 4 sections. This keeps the strip in place as you peel away the backing and helps keep a more even line.

  The red green and blue leds obviously can make their primary colors in a few different shades.  They also do a decent pink, and purple.  But there are no pleasing shades of anything else including white, orange, yellow.Of you stick to the colors it can do they are nice and bright though.  It also remembers what color it was if you turn it off and on.  Which is nice.The sync to music also can’t stay on beat. Seems like lag during the music but then the music stops and it just flashes randomly.

    Way too bright (for casual lighting)
  
",3.0,khris,"Reviewed in the United States May 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  I returned these lights a few months ago because they are very bright, even on the dimmest setting (I hung these on the tops of my walls). They are good for parties, recording videos, or taking photos. But if you are just looking for casual lighting as a subtle decoration for your room, you will want to look somewhere else. I also can't forget that the whole ""16 million colors"" thing isn't as good as it sounds. You will notice 15 unique colors tops when trying to change colors with the app.

  We positioned these lights around my young children's beds and they loved them. Then, after a month or so, the blue LED in short segments stop working. We have returned and replaced them each, and the replacements do the same thing (in different places). Obviously, this product is trash and suffers from the poorest of workmanship. DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!

  Unit is less than 6' away from my wi-fi router but the light's controller constantly loses connection. Reconnecting via the app doesn't work. The only solution is to pull the power connector to the control unit (pulling the plug doesn't work). Then it works again for a few hours, then loses connection again. Pretty useless.

  This is the first thing I'm reviewing. I felt obligated by the quality of both the product and the service I've received.The lights are great. They've really improved the vibe of my living room. I initially chose these over other light strips because of the music sync feature which works great. After a while, the music sync feature seemed to fall out of sync occasionally. I emailed the company expecting a troubleshooting link and limited help, but I was pleasently surprised.They not only offered me troubleshooting advice, but very quickly offered to send out a replacement free of charge. They placed the order for me immediately and it arrived in two days. The new lights are amazing and the music sync feature works again. I highly recommend these light strips!

  These are great! We bought them for our RV and they are SO easy to use! The Govee app sets up easily. You can make these work with Alexa or Google Home very easily.  You can change the color, brightness, make them flicker or blink; you can make them move in time to music or the sound levels in a movie - it's well worth the price! They were less than $25 when we bought them, but even paying a bit more I still would want these lights.

",4.0,Nathaniel J. Swartz,"Reviewed in the United States May 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  These strips are fairly bright, the color are ok, and the app works reasonably well.  My only issue comes in from the fact that the way they are advertised on Amazon they appear to be individually addressable LED strips and not single color.  They are of course single color, and like many single color strips some of the colors, such as orange are fairly bad looking.  Otherwise very good.

  Got this a week ago and just had it set up today. Everything works fine but somehow the colors on my strip won't turn to certain colors. When I put red it turns green and purple is white, orange is also white. Quite disappointed but it looks nice nonetheless.Edit : My initial rating for this was a 3 star and my previous review is the one above (titled ""not so rgb""). However, I have changed the rating to a 5 star. Here's why, the customer service is amazing. I wrote the review and not even 24 hours passed I was contacted by them asking for permission to send me a new set of lights. The new set then came the next day (super fast imo) and worked flawlessly (it glows red and all the other hues). Not only that, they also followed up with me to make sure that it was working the way i wanted it to. I would without a doubt recommend this to anyone who wants to add a bit of light to their room. The only recommendation I have to improve is to probably include instructions on how to connect 2 or more strips sets together and maybe add more presets on the app. Other than that flawless.

  I've loved LED light strips for a long time. I've had two strips before that were a different cheaper brand that both broke on me but I still didn't want to give up on having these. Finally caved and bought this kind, relieved to say they work beautifully! We'll see if they last.... being able to control through your phone is VERY handy, and the DYI settings are super fun to play with. Easy to set up, adhesive works great and the little corner clips are a very useful inclusion. Again, we'll see if they last more than a few months like my last two did. But so far, very impressed!

  The lights are super easy to install and set up, but if I try to make them white half of them are green for some reason. Sinking them up to music is pretty cool, but the microphone built into the lights sucks. It's got to be pretty loud in order for them lights to react to the music. They're okay but I have other sets that work better. I want to be able to tell my Google home to turn the lights a certain color and they turn that color! These lights don't seem capable of doing that for certain colors which is disappointing.

  Amazing product with great features and customer service. I ordered 3 light strips and put them all in my room and connected them to my Google home. With a simple voice command, I can control all of them or individual ones. This is not the dream color edition so it has less colors, and the whole strip is a single color. There are many color modes as well. Dream color edition is much more customizable and in am using that one on my bed. They offer in app customer service and sent me a free light because 3 of the rgb lights on my strip couldn't display blue colors, and the shipment was extremely fast. I highly recommend this brand of lights because of the customization, app and WiFi control, and customer service.

  The product was easy to install but has a lot of syncing and light display issues.  the spectrum of color the lights actually support is significantly lower than advertised,  with many basic colors (such as pink) being displayed as purple, certain greens as yellow and bright reds as orange.  in addition to this,  many of the individual LEDs are not outputting the same color in nonsensical areas of the strip.While i could give this product more than 1 star just for the fact that there are no dead LEDs on the strip,  the basic purpose of the product isn't being met on multiple levels,  and for something simple like a light strip that should really be a no brainer. The product can't display the colors in a calibrated fashion and can't achieve the colors i want,  so it's a failure on every level for me.

  I have bought this strip light a couple of different times.  The first time it died I believe because I didn't handle the lights well, I put them on my children's bunk bed that might have been a mistake. The second time I got them I put them on the wall near the ceiling. The connection to the power and control for the lights is heavy. I recommend using the mounts that come in the box at least at the start of the strip lights. In both cases, I did have a section where the blue stopped working. It was inconvenient at best. I did decide the second time to contact customer support and try to get it replaced. The Support rep was very pleasant we exchanged a couple of emails and they shipped a new product right away.  The customer service tech even followed up to make sure I was satisfied. Definitely recommend if for nothing else than the quality customer services.

You have to connect to the strip via Bluetooth. Then through bluetooth you connect to wifi. I was able to get Alexa working with the strip for about 5 minutes at a time, then it drops the Wi-Fi connection and reverts back to bluetooth. Wont buy from Govee again. This is the first time I've had light strip connections like this and its from a brand I hadn't tried before.

These bend somewhat easy as long as you don’t need it to be near a 90% angle but will move over a gradual turn and have pretty good color replication.The negative:It would never connect to my internet through the app and the app is also quite a bit janky. It had a very noticeable amount of lag between optioning the app and being able to connect to the lights to change the color, then the on/off master switches to turn all the lights off/on in a room rarely worked however the timer function did alright. These lights aren’t the brightest LED lights ever and it would take a decent amount of them (4-5) to light up a whole room which is getting into the realm of just buying philips hue bulbs (which I ultimately did)Would I recommend? If you just want to set your lights on a color and forget it as accent lighting around one or two things then sure however if you want to change the colors semi frequently, connect to Alexa, google home or Siri or have an app that actually works and connects quickly or lighting up your whole room then I would suggest you invest in philips hue as they are quantifiably better.

  These lights are really nice and look great. You are able to cut them to your desired length which is really great. But for some reason I thought that I could cut them into multiple pieces and all the pieces would still light up. After setting everything up I was devastated when I realized you can’t cut the wires and expect them to work still. Anyways I’m assuming most people won’t have this issue, but make sure you don’t cut the wires. But the tiny strip of lights that work is super cool!

    Color accuracy is very bad
  
",2.0,J. Burgess,"Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  I'm pretty disappointed in the ability to dial in anything resembling a soft white or standard light bulb type of color.  Selecting the dead center of the color wheel, which is white on the wheel, results in a very deep blue/green color.  To get anywhere near white you have to move the selection way into the red/yellow section of the color wheel, which is just strange.  Telling Alexa to set the lights to warm white results in an almost green color.  White gets you a bright ocean blue color.  On top of that the strip had a small tear near the disclaimer tag and 90% of the strip would not work at first until I smoothed out the tear.  Even now it feels like a band aid fix and I'm not very confident these will last very long.

  I want to like these because Alexa was easy to set up and use, they have a good amount of preset scenes and scheduling abilities, and the though I bought extra clips I didn’t need them because the adhesive is very strong and the product comes with enough clips to hold up the weak points (turns etc). But the colors are off. Warm white is green, and yellow looks green too. Cool white is very blue, not bluish like actual cool white, like, actually blue. Also, half the strip works sometimes and won’t light up sometimes. Maybe i just got a dud and they’re usually awesome but I’m gonna have to buy something else to replace them with.

  You will not be let down by these.I have a very small living room with not a lot of sunlight. I decided to buy these to have some overhead light all around kind of to ""match the sunlight"" that didn't work out because the light is not daylight enough. BUT the different light options, colors, settings made up for everything. We always have these on in different colors. The music setting works perfectly, you just need to make sure the ""switch"" is closer to the music source than not since it can pick up other sounds. There is no problem with Alexa either.The only minor thing that we've noticed is that we can't have the lights connected on several devices at the same time. If I connect the lights to my phone, it'll disconnect from my roommate's. It doesn't take that long to connect again, it's just a little hassle.Love these lights and would recommend to any one who enjoys a chill time.

  After running into several disappointments with various controllable RGB items in the last few months, I was very happy that these actually did deliver everything I was hoping for. The adhesive is very strong. Admittedly they are a bit difficult to deal with around corners, but doable. I love that the strips are able to be cut to fit a smaller length. The physical controller does quite a bit on its own to set a variety of solid colors and brightness, but the Govee app gave me everything I was hoping for. I really wanted to be able to set a color ""scheme"" with several different colors and I was able to do that (right now I have it set to fade from teal to pink to purple). Very easy to set up and use. I love that once I set a custom color setting, I can still use the physical controller to just push the button on and off and it will still use my setting.

I had lengthy and detailed correspondence with this vendor about this situation. Unfortunately, this setting was not possible with these lights. I must use the manual switch to turn them off which I mounted on the side of the headboard so it isn't a big deal. Seller were nothing but cooperative and helpful.

  Don’t recommend. The product itself is good but you can’t connect two strips together. You have to literally tape a bunch of crap to the wall to get them to connect. Never does it say you need to buy adapters. This is bs. My other led strip lights had connectors on Both ends to just clip together and that’s it. These, don’t. I completely gave up on trying to get them to stay together, 3 hours later. In the picture it shows the attempt I made to put them together, and they are touching. But you have to literally apply pressure for it work. The end of the strip is NOT flat (it should be) so it can’t properly lay on the lines. I’m really disappointed, I was super excited for these to come it. Please fix this. Add connectors on both ends of your strips. Who ever thought that it was a good idea to not, is not smart.

Setup was super easy and Google is controlling them without issue.There are two things you should be aware of:1) When you go to white, these put out a cooler ""daylight"" white and don't really match the Hue bulbs, unless you set them to daylight as well.2) This is the bigger issues for me.  When going from color to color or dimming, they are not smooth.  They just jump to the color or the dim level.So I cut them to size, and for the remaining strip, I bought a power supply, some connectors and this:Konxie Smart WiFi RGB/GRB LED Controller, Compatible with Alexa/Google Assistant, for 5050/3528 LED Strip Light, Have 24 Key Remote Control,Support Android iOS SystemWorks just as well, and smoothly fades between colors and dim levels.  I may just cut the Govee controller out of my first strip and replace it with another Konxie controller.So my suggestion would be, if you want to save some money and have things look a little smoother, the Konxie and a strip may be the way to go.Hope that helps!

  I was looking for a way to light up my living room, but couldn't fit a lamp behind my sofa. Came up with the idea to mount an LED light strip along a small ridge behind my sectional, and it turned out great! Corner was a little funky because these strips aren't meant to make 90 degree right turns, but overall I think it works exactly how I wanted it to. Now I can control my living room lights with my voice!Only downside is the app isn't perfect, and while you have some control over making custom lighting profiles, it does seem limited. Also, some colors it does not display properly. For example, if I change the color to yellow in the app, it looks green. Don't know if this is a common issue, or just a defect with mine. Not too worried about it though.

  Easy to apply, excellent 3M adhesive with useful extra clips.  More than double the length of the Philips Hue Starter kit at about 1/3 the price and requires no hub.  Had to try three times to get it to link to network, but has been a solid connection since at more than 40' from my router. The Govee AOS ap is fine, but I am fully controlling the strip using the Alexa ap with no problems.  This strip is BRIGHT! The maximum setting I am using is 10% and I drop it to less than 5% at night (actually set it to 1% but I am not sure that anything less than 5% works).  Overall - perfectly satisfied.

",3.0,Gurka2015,"Reviewed in the United States August 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought two of these to add some accent and task lighting under my kitchen cabinets. Installation was easy and it's a great deal for a generous length of light strip. However, I found several things that made me feel the low price in the wrong ways :1. The white lights are simulated, meaning that at higher temperatures the light looks blue, and at lower Temps the light looks yellow-green, which was not acceptable for what I wanted to use them for.2. The brightness is lacking3. The app is finicky and doesn't allow for complex scheduling4. The strip is thin and the LEDs run hot. I noticed this when I took the strip off to replace it with the Kasa lightstrip that at regular points on the cabinet underside where the LEDs had been, some of the finishing had bubbled up likely due to the heat from the strip lights.5. Music sync feature is coolAs I mentioned, I ended up spending fore on the Kasa light strips which have dedicated white color LEDs and thus can give accurate white colors. Its app is also easier to use and more polished.I'd keep these in mind if I wanted to accent light my TV or something else, but if you're planning on placing these in a prominent place in your home, I would pass on these and splurge a bit more.

  These work great for lighting our gaming table. Perfect length, the colors are vibrant, and the pre-set ""scenes"" are nice. (I love the candlelight one.)  The only thing preventing it from a perfect 5 stars is that while it says ""wifi"", you get the most functionality when you are connected to them through bluetooth, and therefor only allows for full control from one device. For the most part, that's not an issue. It was just something we discovered. I didn't have any trouble configuring the app to work with Google Home on my phone, but another family member did have some trouble on theirs. Despite that, we would probably buy these again if we need to. Thanks!

  I received this and was very excited to use it as a LED light on the back of my living room TV. Before I started to tape it on, I tested that they worked. The LED lights were nice and bright and the colors were great, plus the music setting where the light goes to the beat worked great. I unplugged them from the connector and started installing them. To my surprise, as soon as I plugged them back in, the lights were EXTREMELY dim. Barely visible as if they were not connected at all. If i touch some of the metal strips with my finger, some of the lights would glow SLIGHTLY brighter. I made sure to cut the strip where you're supposed to. I tried using another electrical socket to see if that may be the problem but nothing changed. Complete waste of money for something I didn't even get to use for 1 minute.

  When I decided to try the Govee Smart LED lights it was strictly because of the price as I often by Philips light strips usually. When the small package was delivered  I was initially disappointed as the package look like a cheap inferior product. I then proceeded to open the package and start the installation process. As I installed the lights I was happily surprised just how much light I was getting at that price point. The adhesion was on point and Govee even provided clips to help keep the lights attached to the surface. Once the lights were installed I started the process of putting the app on my phone. I was delighted by how easy it was to get this app set up and going, I now have this app installed and connected to by Amazon smart home for easy use, I could not be happier with the product.

  This product isn't terrible for the price point. I didn't want to invest in a full Philips Hue system, so I went with something cheaper. The first one I got was faulty and had a few broken LEDs. Amazon sent me a new one, which worked fine. I hooked it up to my WiFi and it seemed to be working. 2 days later, it wouldn't work with my Amazon Echo. I tried disconnecting and re-connecting a million times but it kept giving me a WiFi error. Finally, I was able to get it to work by making a new Govee account. Such a headache. Keep in mind this only works on Wifi 2.4. If you have a mesh system, it's a pain since your router won't make individual 2.4 and 5 ghz signals.Negatives aside, the LEDs are pretty bright for such a cheap product. I don't hate it, but I would probably get something else if I had to do it all over again.

   These lights are incredible!!! Very bright work with both alexa and Google home. Wanted to back light TV, Hue lights would have been $140+, Govee 19.99 + tax no brainer.  App is easy to use connects seamlessly with Alexa and Google built in microphone senses music and changes colors creating a basic light show if you like ( included video). If you don’t use app there is a remote (included) and wired control box to set up and use. GREAT PRODUCT! Just ordered another set to do Bedroom TV and a 32’ set to do above kitchen cabinets.

  These strip lights are great.  I wanted them for above cabinet lighting.  They were easy to set up and most important for me is that they go to last setting when power is applied to controller/strip.  My only real issue with them is I can't seem to get them to go to pure white.  I use pixels for Christmas displays and these go to a very clean white.  The preset white on these strips has a blue tint to them.  The seller for these is very good with any issues and responds in a timely manner.  I would definitely buy these again especially thru the same vendor.

  I wish I could rate it higher, but these things have given me nothing but trouble. These things are nearly impossible to wiggle through 4-pin connectors and as a result the colors with often be miss-matched, dimmer than the ones connected to it, or will just not work. I have set them up around my wall and after going through hell to get them accordingly, no more than 2 1/2 months later and one starts changing color on me again so I gave it a slight wiggle which fixed it, and then 15 min later they BOTH died and refuse to turn on now. Maybe it was just a bad box or something but now I’m just in half darkness so that sucks big time

  These lights are beautiful once hung and the adhesive sticks amazing to the surface.My complaint is the lights have already blown in certain spots and have only been hung for 3 months!!!! I bought these for my daughter for Christmas, we hung them January 1st. They were all lit for about 3 weeks when she told me a few kept going out here and there...... now 3 months later there’s lots of places with blown out bulbs! I get that lights blow out but come on, they have only been hung for 3 months (they are small led lights not bulbs so they can’t be replaced. Once blown the entire strip of lights has to be replaced) I was hoping these would last (especially for the price) a little longer than that. Also, the adhesive is pretty strong and will peel our ceiling when we replace them.  Not very impressed:(Not sure why I can’t submit pictures for this review?

But one day in May, I turned the device on and half of it wouldn’t even turn on. I thought to myself it was getting old and it would still work. To my surprise a few days later the device would not even turn on. It would connect to my phone and let me control it but the lights just would not turn on. This is an amazing device and I was a little tight on money when I purchased it. But for the price I payed I expected it to work for more than 5 months.

  I use these lights in my classroom to help with my procedures. I change the color of the light for each teaching mode - whole class instruction, small group, and independent work. During whole class instruction only one person can talk at a time. During small group work - students can talk quietly about their work and collaborate with each other. During independent work there is no talking allowed. The lights work great and my first set of lights have been working without problems for two years.

  I purchased and set this up for my partner as a surprise gift.  The only real difficult part of the setup was figuring out how to bend the strip around the corners (I put them under his kitchen cabinets) so it looked good and didn't damage the strip.  After I put them up, I read that the strip is not supposed to be in contact with metal...which it is.  Hopefully it will not ruin the strip.  I had a little bit of trouble connecting it to Alexa, but once I did, it works perfectly and looks REALLY COOL.  I love that you can change the color, you can choose color settings (like sunrise, sunset, romantic, etc) and it was a fairly simple installation process.  I was concerned about cutting the strip to fit the cabinets, but I cut off the excess strip and it worked well.  He was so surprised and was excited to show everyone!

  I specifically purchased this light strip because it stated it worked with Alexa. I've tried numerous times and methods to get the Alexa app to discover the light strip without success. The lights connect and work fine through the Govee Home app and that's about it. I've reset the light, unplugged the light for 10 minutes like suggested, deleted and added the light from the Govee app, uninstalled and reinstalled the Govee Home app, disabled and reenable the Govee Home Alexa skill more times than I can count and still couldn't get the Alexa app to discover the light strip. So far, customer support hasn't been too helpful of trying to resolve the issue. I'm a bit disappointed that the primary feature that I purchased this product for doesn't work as advertised.

   Overall this is a good product it sticks well to the wall even after removing it many times.The companion app called Govee Home adds a lot to the value of this LED strip.Govee app allows you to switch between scenes colors or even Music sync.Brightness is good, installation is straight forward and length isn't bad for small applications.However, this is a 5 meters (16.4ft) strip so if you're looking to upgrade or extended at a later time I recommend you buy the longest one (32.8ft) the first time then you can extend using RGB amplifiers or else you'll lose quality.I don't see any cons or flops to this awesome LED strip but if there was one I would say the microphone for music sync is so sensitive to the point that it randomly triggers the light from time to time even with no music playing but that's for me, it may be a good thing for you, but Govee Support contacted me and they were very helpful and generous.

   The strips are really easy to install with the adhesive backs. Adhesive is very strong and stuck really well to the underside on my cabinets without me cleaning them at all. The included clips are pretty useless they don't clamp down enough to the strips in place and I stripped a few screw heads. The strips are not continuous, there are a few spots that they soldered together so you can't cut the strip there and fit it into a connector or jumper.Hooking up to Alexa was a snap. Alexa app picked up on the signal right away and connected in a few seconds.All the colors are great but the white. It isn't a pure white and gives off to much blue/green hues against our white backsplash.

  I really love these lights extremely easy to install and operate from the attached remote and the App i have no complaints what so ever. I even have mine linked to my Alexa so that i can just tell her to turn the lights on because we as people are now to lazy to do it ourselves lol she can even change the color. I bought these for my office with my Gaming PC setup as backlight just to give things a cooler appearance and they look great at an even better price you can install them literally anywhere makes me want to buy more but i dont know where else to put them. I highly recommend these to anyone looking to add LED's to the Gaming PC setups or just anyone wanting to just add some style to an area. The lights are also very low profile so they aren't sticking out alot so you are not limited to where you can put them.

They are on the side wall about 4 inches above the steps its not like they get hit by anything, the hamd rail is on the other side.

Hope they will upgrade functions.- The Govee Home app controls the Lights as well as other Govee devices (I just got a thermometer/hygrometer too).THE BAD- THE UI interface for controlling Power and Timer are not well implemented.RECOMMENDATION- This is the first time I have used LED strip lights so have no comparisons.

  The LEDs on these are the same as the crazy cheap LEDs where you can get 5 times the length for the same price. Yellow, orange, purple, pink, and warm white does not exist. So instead of getting a warm color range, everything is a sickly green. So in reality it's not 16 million colors, its red, green, blue, and cool white. Definitely was not worth it just for the sake of having it being app/Alexa controlled.

  Do NOT buy if you have a very secure WiFi password.  We purchased these and proceeded to set them up but the required app does not allow enough spaces for our password.  Amazon was extremely helpful but said our only choice would be to change our password or return them.  Changing our password isn’t an option as our network is very secure and services our business as well as our house.UPDATE 2/05/2021. After numerous chats with customer service they sent me out a brand new different set of lights to fix the issue.  They were extremely helpful which Is completely surprising in today’s world where customer service is almost non existent.  For their amazing service I changed review from 1 star to 4 stars.

  By now you’ve seen the reviews. It’s a fantastic kit and works great with Alexa right out of the box. I’d really like to see this light be a bit brighter though. I bought two of these units, I used them both on identical desks. The first one was in a basement and felt like it was lacking in overall brightness. So much so that I hesitated installing the next one. The second unit seemed brighter overall but was near a window. Overall I’m happy with the product and installation.I ended up using the supplied hanging hardware for the power cord.

  I really love these lights. I can control them with my Alexa, but they also include a remote. I mounted them to the back of my TV for a nice glow around it. I cut them to the width and height of the back of my 75"" TV and used L-shaped 4 pin connectors (sold seperately) to make the turns for a nice clean look with solid adhesion. The price point can't be beat... Hue light strips would run you $70-$100. Why pay more? Great product, quality, and value. Highly recommend!

    Excellent Product for the Price; Excellent Service
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've bought Govee products before (namely, LED strip lights for my car).  They are great LED strip lights, made all the more better by their competitive price.  They're not as good at color reproduction as the Philips Hue strips, and the discrepancy in the brightness between blue and green is quite large, but for this price, you will not find anything better.  In interest of full transparency, I received a strip light that was not lighting up for the last 3 ft., so I asked if I could exchange it, and the process was easy and smooth.  I use them as kitchen undercabinet lighting, and they serve their purpose extremely well.  I used a connector/extender to run the wire through the cabinet around the microwave, and it works marvelously.  Word of advice: before you peel off the 3M tape protecting the adhesive backing, make sure you wipe down the surface you plan to adhere the strip to.  It will make your life and installation process MUCH easier by decreasing the number of obstructions between the adhesive strip and your desired surface.

  Applied lights to back of TV which took about 5 minutes. Lights use a adhesive tape under the strip of lights and has small adhesive clips for support if needed. Comes with screws as well if the lights are applied to a wall or ceiling.Lights connect to a manual wired controller to control basic functions. One button to change color, another button to react to sound and power button.To get the most out of your lights will be to download the govee app. From there you can connect via Bluetooth and set any color, fade to other colors, set timers and download themes of light shows or fades by user submissions.I definitely plan to get another set down the road for my stairs and walls.

  I just finished attaching the lights to my mirror. My bedroom is pretty nice but there was nothing to break from all the wood furniture in my room besides my lizard's tank. These lights break up the dark woods and sets an incredible vibe in the room! I definitely love the features included with the device and that these lights come with bluetooth connection - so I can change the lights and turn it on/off from my phone. There's a handy feature I would like to mention if you buy this: if you go into the app there is a setting called ""DIY"" and then select ""Smart Color Picking"". It scans an image that you select from your photo album and picks out the dominating colors from it and will display the colors to the speed/transition that you want. This feature is really cool!!Update: The app is pretty finicky. Selecting the colors on the app does not always correspond to what actually appears. I find that I usually have to move my finger across the colors to get the tones that I want. Also, the yellows are more green than yellow. The smart color picking feature does not seem to work all that well after I tried using it a few times. The app needs to be updated to address the issues with the colors corresponding to what is actually selected.

",3.0,Misae,"Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2021","









  
  
    
  I got these on a sale, and for the price I paid they're pretty darn good. They did what I wanted, which was blue spectrum lighting on my gaming desk area. The smart home integration and their app were really nice extra features, and made setting them just how I wanted pretty easy. However, I have a note about these that made me drop my rating down to 3 stars.Even though they show it in the app as being capable of doing white spectrum lights (cool white, white, warm white etc) they definitely do not do that well at all, and that extends into their ability to do colors like yellow/orange as well. Any lighting that needs any yellow or orange tones just ends up looking green, and don't match the spectrum shown in the app at all. I suspect these lights only have RGB tones, but they sorta try to fake a standard white spectrum and yellows through that, which is why it looks green? I don't know much about how LEDs actually function though, but that is my best guess.While I personally don't care about that too much, since I didn't plan to use that feature anyway, I'm still docking 2 stars since that feels like some false advertisement. If I had paid full price for these, I'd possibly consider returning them, but since I got them on discount and they do what I wanted fairly well, I have no real reason to. That said, I'd be pretty damn upset if I bought these for white, yellow, or orange tones.

  This is a very nice LED light strip! Easy to install. Looks great and the electrical connections are small and unobtrusive. The the ability to use the on/off switch or Alexa is a plus. It is easier then using a remote to turn on/off the lights that are used with most other products.  It took me a few tries to get the lights to communicate with the APP. Kept getting ""network anomaly"" when trying to register. Maybe the Govee site was not available for a short time. However, since then, everything is working great!. As others have noted, the lights could be a little brighter, however, they are bright enough to light my counter top. I would definitely recommend.

   these led lights are so easy to install and they look AWESOME. the app was very easy to use and the led lights even had a music synchronization to take the rhythm of the sound in the background and turn the lights on and off accordingly. these were the best LEDs I've found and I personally think that govee is the best brand to consider getting led lights from. if you have a big bedroom thorough like I do, I think you should get the same led lights but the 32.8 ft version. that is the only reason I will be returning these and getting bigger ones from govee.

  It's not bad for a cheaper Phillips hue alternative... However unlike the Philips hue, these regularly disconnect from wifi and I have to unplug / replug and sometimes set up their wifi all over again as they stop responding completely. Still, as a cheaper option they're probably still worth it

We also bought her an Alexa dot to go with them, so she can walk in her room and tell Alexa to turn the lights on.  Alexa can also change the modes, and colors.  No issues with them sticking to the wall.  We did use some alcohol wipes before applying them, to make sure they would stick.

  These LED lights give out great color. I put them on the back of my TV and I was surprised how strongly it stuck to the plastic surface. I don't think I can take them off at this point even if I wanted to. It's not strong enough, however, to pick up my Wi-Fi signal from my modem in my office. Though it sees the Wi-Fi on the app with at least 1 bar of Wi-Fi strength, it will not connect unless I bring the router closer, which isn't a long-term solution. When it does connect to the Wi-Fi (again, when the router is closer) it's nice being able to use Google Home to at it to routines to turn on and off.

  I bought 2 sets. One works perfectly fine, but other set is horrible. The color of a few of the lights are off (and more and more of them over time), and are different from the rest of the strip.It's great that you can dim the brightness. I use it as a night light on the staircase. The controller  on the strip is simple with only 3 buttons, but functional and convinient. I hate having to find the remote or find the app on my phone like with other light strips.It adheres a little too well that it would rip the paint your surface if you tried to adjust it while installing them. So probably best not to clean your surface before sticking them on.Overall it's great, for one of the sets. But it's already past my return window, and I cannot return my defective one. And I don't want to rip it off, along with the paint......

  These lights are a great way to spruce the look of your rooms up. The lights itself are decently bright but dim a small margin when connected beyond the length of one strip if your room requires longer strips. The music mode is also decent and at first one of the more interesting features of the light but after a while it makes me wish it had a bit more customization in terms of how it reacts to music. (if you want really cool music lights I would consider looking at the dreamcolor lights)One of the main problems with this is probably that with some usage, certain LEDs will malfunction and create off color spots, however, customer support is more than happy to help you out with any problems that occur with your lights as they did with me.

  I got a new desk since I've been working at home and even with blinds up and lights on, I still lack light to see my keyboard.  I really only needed a light to shine onto the keyboard but I will pay extra money for quality, I like the RGB aspect of it and with 16+ feet, I felt I could get creative.Anyways, I checked to make sure the lights worked by plugging everything in and they worked fine.  I proceeded to apply the lights to my glass desk (no problem with adhesive!) and they look great and work great!  A huge selling point to me was that it could connect to my Wi-Fi and I could use the Alexa in my room to control everything.  I've followed all the instructions on downloading the Govee Home App and connecting the device to my Alexa App.  It shows I'm connected to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth and the Skills are all enabled/linked BUT I cannot get Alexa to complete my requests because the ""Device is unresponsive.""  I tried multiple ways, read online and even had my super tech savvy roommate try and no success.  My roommate ended up looking up the Govee Home App and the app had more 1 Star Reviews than 5 Stars and majority of the reviews mentioned this exact issue.  The reviews on Amazon were relatively good so I figured I couldn't lose.  I was wrong...Overall, the lights work, the adhesive is super strong on the glass and I can control everything from my phone.  I'm just disappointed to spend $40 on lights that don't give you all the features they say.  I would return them but I've already stuck them on my desk.  Had I known I couldn't utilize my Alexa with the lights, I wouldn't have bought them.

   I love these! Which is why I'm super bummed that they're going out after 10 days of having them.I put my strip on my wall, about a 1/2 inch from my ceiling, along 2 walls in my bedroom. I cleaned my wall with alcohol wipes and let dry before applying, didn't bend/cut/crease the strip, and gently installed the brackets with a regular screw driver. I use them along with my smart bulbs, and alexa, to light my house up with calm dark colors at night for a night light. Literally no damage has been done to them, there's no moisture or extreme temperatures etc, but 4 of the LED diodes have lost the blue primary color. So when set to regular blue, 4 diodes are out. When set to other colors, those 4 are off because blue isn't working. 3 went out last night, and one more went out today. You can tell more are on their way out. Its pretty upsetting considering they're just sitting there, on the wall by my ceiling. Theres no reason why they should be going out 10 days after buying them, with probably 7-8 days of use. Otherwise they're great.

    Stuck LEDs?
  
",4.0,Stack,"Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  UPDATE 7/7/20 - Since my last update, even more lights have become stuck, pretty much the entire length of the strip at similar intervals. However, Govee did contact me and quickly sent out a replacement. Since I have the original LED strip installed in a location that’s tough to get to I haven’t yet installed the replacement strip. However, I’m adding a star to my review because of Govee’s excellent customer service.- - -UPDATE 5/15/20 - In the day or two since I posted this review, another section of lights as gotten “stuck” on green, as can be seen in the photo.  Anybody else have this problem???- - -I bought these in September of 2019 and finally got around to using them a few weeks ago. I added them to the backside of my daughter's new platform bed, to serve as a sort of nightlight.This is my 2nd purchase of this style of LED strip lights, first of the Govee brand. Off the bat, the adhesive on the Govee brand is way better than the other. I installed the other brand on the back of my TV and even after thorough cleaning, the lights just peel right off once the ambient temperature from the TV starts to rise. I was worried these Govee lights would do the same because they slid around a bit during installation. Once you give them a firm press though, they are locked in and don't move.Setup was simple with the app, although I wish they used an easier identifier when selecting the lights during setup. You're supposed to choose your lights from a long tiled list, but the icons are too small to be of much use and the text are just the model numbers, which are all similar. Once selected though, connecting to my wifi network and adjusting the settings on the lights was very simple. I initially added the lights as a skill to our Echo Dots, to be used as part of a routine that automatically turns off and on the lights at a set time. It worked for a day but then became unresponsive to the whole Alexa environment. Turns out the lights just needed to be added to our wifi network again. Rather than adding back into the Alexa routine, I'm instead created a Scene in the Govee app that automatically turns the lights on and off, and it works fine.The reason I'm knocking off a couple stars is because as you can see in the photo, after only a couple weeks' use there appears to be LEDs ""stuck"" on green at a couple portions of the strip. I don't know if they're necessarily stuck at that color though, because if I change the lights to red or green, those sections of LEDs adjust accordingly. But my daughter insists on the light blue/cyan color despite the few off color LEDs so that's what we're going with. I find the off color LEDs way more annoying than she does, and I urged her to switch to a different color; but it is her room and good luck reasoning with a 6 year old.I like the strips, the price is decent when compared to other offerings. But I'm peeved at the stuck lights. They didn't arrive that way, they worked fine for the first week or so. They just seemed to get stuck at random, no rhyme or reason. Moving my daughter's bed to fidget with the lights will be a pain so I'll probably just live with it.

  My wife and I have enjoyed watching our TV with the back lighting. It gives our room more ambiance.Not sure why some reviewers are negative about this. The setup was easy and it worked on the first try. I have had it for a month with no issues, just fun and enjoyment. You have to read the instructions about cutting (if you are going to do that) and turning corners. Planning ahead is key (where you are going to lay it out). Plugging it in to the power module is delicate. The four pins need to be aligned carefully. I can see that if handled carelessly it will fail to illuminate. I'm sure this is where people are having the problem.

It is super easy to use and pleasing to look at.  In a world where every smart product has their own app that gums up your phone, this is one app you will be pleased to have.  Especially if you intend to buy more than one strip or Govee product (which I intend to do).Third, the product is awesome.  It is shipped and appears as advertised.  I have no issues with the product, application, or operation.Fourth, the modes of the strips are awesome.  The sound responsiveness comes from a mic in the control unit, so if you are getting this to have dancing lights then be aware that the distance the control unit is from the sound source matters.Here is what you should know:  I have contacted customer support to ask a couple questions and this was the response (my words) The length of the strips can be shortened to fit your application, but you CANNOT lengthen any strips because it may effect voltage and operation of the lights.  There are no ""unlighted"" extension kits for strips so what you buy is what you get (unless you cut them shorter).  You will need an outlet for every strip that you need.  So it can get a little difficult hiding power cords if you intend to plug in a lot.  The potential for this product is awesome and the value for a comparable product (looking at you, Phillips) is well worth it.  I am very product loyal and I have may Hue lights, but I will be using Govee for my smart strip-light needs.Translation: buy the strip closest to the length that you need (going a little longer) because you can shorten but you can't lengthen.  For larger applications you will buy several strips and plug them all in individually.  But don't let the pictures fool you.  Here is why.  All the pictures depict wonderful multi light system with different colors showing on the same strip (although this is possible with some models) with NO POWER CORDS SHOWING.  Keep in mind, these photos are intended to REPRESENT the POSSIBLE application of the strips.  I do not believe they are the ACTUAL products being used. They are a relatively accurate representation of lighting, but not of application, aesthetics, intensity, or operation.  Look, I'm not trying to be ambiguous.  I love this product.  However, it will take me a long time and a lot of money to get the effect and lighting that I want, because the strips are not modular.

  I Feel like I was scammed. The picture was of the dreamcolor strips (the strips that can do multiple colors) however what arrived was the plain RGB strips. I shouldn’t have been surprised as the link was for an on sale now click here to buy. Since they are usually around thirty for the dream color and these were listed as around 20, which is the usuallyPrice for just the rgb version. So they weren’t on sale, they weren’t dreamcolor, and they were just normal priced single color strips with the dream color picture fake marked as on sale to trick people into buying them.

  Garbage. I have never been so disappointed by a product from Amazon. I work in tv/film lighting and the quality of these LEDs are some of the worst I have seen. The colors are terrible! The ""cool white"" is just blue, and if you try to warm the color temperature they start to turn green (probably from something like a green spike or just being absolute garbage LED). Their preset colors weren't even close to matching the colors they were meant to represent. Do not buy. Do more research. Look for a company that actually makes LEDs for home installs and not DIY kits from amazon, especially not GOVEE.

    Amazing Product - Average App

  These led strips are working properly, easy to fix (I recommend you to use connectors for corners to avoid undesired light density) and FUN! However, the application is average and needs improvement. Even I ordered 2nd time (as gifts to my friends) I gave 4 star.PROS:- Easy to fix. Cut-Connect-Fixate and Go...- Self adhesive tape is strong enough and they even send some more tapes for mounting.- Controller also has a double sided tape, so you can mount it anywhere you want without driving screws.- Lots of funny modes in app.- ""Sound"" mode works properly in app (yes, the colors change with music properly)CONS:- Actually there is only one Con as I experienced. You can not share a device with someone. For example, if a friend of yours, your partner or your roommate wants to control the device, they can override you and get the control of the device easily. Once they add device to their device list, it will be removed from your device list, and then you need to install the device again which is easy but becomes annoying when you do repeatedly.There are some other devices/apps allow users to share devices or at least share some functions of devices.P.S: For the people who lives overseas voltage is 240V here and the adaptor works properly so far (more than a month).

    Adhesive applied incorrectly to backing
  
",4.0,SnugglesTheHusky,"Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  I was excited to put these on but as soon as I began to peel off the tape backing, I realized the adhesive had been applied to the backing instead of the light strips.  The led strip has no sticky adhesive to install at all.  Seems someone made a mistake at the factory.  It's unfortunate because the AC Adapter, controller and the lights seem to be of good quality.  I might have to contact Amazon to see what they can do for me.UPDATE AUGUST 7th 2019 =========================================================After I express my disappointment with these strip lights (see above), the company reached out to me.  They shipped a replacement set asap and kept in touch until the new lights arrived.The replacement, thankfully, did not have the same issue with the adhesive that the first set of lights.  I was able to install them behind my living room television as a tv backlight.  The box arrives with instructions for setting up the lights with Amazon Alexa, but not with the Google's Home Assistant.  Through trial and error, I did figure out how to get the Google Home App to communicate with the Govee app.  Govee really needs to update the instructions that come inside the box to describe, in detail, how to set it up with the Google ecosystem because set up wasn't automatic or intuitive.  But it is in fact possible to get it working with Google Home.  I added a photo that shows the Govee on my Google Home app main screen.The Govee software is pretty refined I thought.  It doesn't require manually putting the controller in pairing mode which is something I really appreciate because my television is wall mounted.  Most home automation devices usually require having the user hold a button down to enter them manually into a setup mode, including the Amazon Echo and Google Home Assistant smart speakers.  But the Govee app is able to get the LED controller into setup mode through software alone.  No need to reach behind the television to get it back on the WIFI network.  I did not need to hold down the power button to get the controller into pairing mode. Set up was pretty easy because the software will automatically add my wifi sid and password into the controller's memory using Bluetooth, then the controller runs off 2.4Ghz Wifi.  5Ghz is not supported.The Govee app has controls for color, brightness, timers, scenes modes, and a ""music"" mode.  The music mode will simply flicker the lights on and off but the controller doesn't have a microphone to actually flicker the lights based on music beats.  The scene modes are Morning, Sunset, Movie, Dating, Romantic, Blinking and Candlelight.  It has an additional DYI mode where you can define your own colors for a scene and the controller will do a transitional fade between the user-defined colors.  You can also control the speed of the transitions from fast to very slow.  It seems you can create an endless number of user-defined DYI scene modes.  I particularly like the Candlelight scene because it simulates the slow warm flicking flame of candlelight.  The timer will let you change scenes based on the day of the week and the time of day.I suspect you might be able to use IFTTT to have the lights triggered by external events which can have a lot of interesting possibilities with water leak, door sensing sensor triggers, etc..  But at the time of writing this review, I haven't gotten around to it to be absolutely sure IFTTT can be used successfully with it.  The Govee app has a community board built into the app, but I can't seem to be able to read the post.  I see there are posts, but nothing shows up on the screen when I open them up.So far, I think these are pretty cool compared to the earlier strip lights that I used with IR blasters.  With the Govee, you can use your phone or tablet instead of a cheap IR remote, or order Alexa and Google to change the lights.  I don't know if Siri is supported but the manufacturer does not make a claim that it might.I think these new Alexa & Google-enabled strip lights are a very nice addition to other lights you might have that are smart switch enabled.  I have Alexa and Google setup with routines that will automatically turn off my living room table lamps, turn on the TV and home theater sound and of course these LED lights as the tv backlight with a single scene command.  I am still hoping prices drop on Venetian blind controllers to add to the scene to make a nice home theater setup.I raised my rating from 1 star to 4.  I think it would have been a five star if they add clear detailed instructions to adding these lights to Google Home.

  With all the positive reviews I thought this would be a no lose situation. It started off great with easy instructions, easy installation and the app works fine. You can change a variety of things via the app and I do enjoy the Alexa connection because its so easy. You can change light temperature, brightness and such.Then the bad news hits hard:There's a color wheel that can be used and I was super excited about that option. However as nice as the LED strip appears and the app too I wish I bought an upgraded GOVEE version or a different brand. The color wheel is a disaster because as easy as it is to use the LED strip color can't match the color.  Realistically, this strip is very limited when it comes to wanting or trying to create a variety of colors. It just can't do it and since I enjoy this technology and LED lights in general this is very veey upsetting.The strip literally can't create a real orange or a real purple. If you want a nice pink color, good luck with that too!So because of the color issue, I recommend you try another brand or spend more money to get a better version, if possible.

  So I bought these because I saw a whole bunch of Tiktok videos where there were led strips on the bottom of people’s bed frames and I wanted to join the bandwagon and do it too. I made a really great decision in going with Govee for a second time. The first time was for my boyfriend’s birthday. He wanted light strips for his room, and I bought him some along with 2k21.Anyways, I bought 16.4 feet worth of light strips, and they were the perfect length, not to mention light up my entire room in the dark! They are great for accent lighting with the adjustable brightness, and the remote attached to the lights can also be stuck to a wall (or bedframe in my case), and the adhesion is so good! They took no time at all to stick to my bedframe! If you’re looking for really good led light strips, I highly recommend Govee.

  The lights had worked great for a couple months. They're easily controlled by the phone app. Unfortunately, sections of the lights just shut off and won't work. The lights are also not covered by a protective plastic tubing like in other brands. I had some LED lights from another brand that lasted me for years without issue. This brand lasted about 4-5 months.

  It’s typically a gamble with LED lights from what I’ve gathered. Some are fantastic some not so much. Govee delivered a great product on this one! Lights sync with google home, Amazon Alexa and Bluetooth/wifi flawlessly! The only thing I didn’t realize is that there is only 1 power source for the lights. I’m you’re not able to set up the two strips very far from each other. Not a 2 pack in the way I imagined.

  I really like this product and love that it can be controlled with Google Home. It was easy to install too.Unfortunately, one of the sub pixels (blue I think) on two or three of the lights went out within 2 weeks. For that section of my light strip, what should be blue is now green and what should be purple is now yellow.When Govee saw I had an issue, they reached out to me and sent a replacement very fast. Any product can have a defect - but Govee fixed it. It is easy to recommend this product and this company.

",1.0,Woomin,"Reviewed in the United States September 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  First putting it on, I noticed the adhesion was not super sticky so I had to buy command strips to further stabilize the LED lights. That added additional costs to the lights which were uncalled for since they insure quality on their company website. Two weeks into using them, I noticed that 3 lights were not synced and would remain a different color than the rest of the lights. This should not be happening since it has not even been a month since I started using them. They are most definitely NOT quality lights as this happened to a friend that bought it as well.

  I put this on the back of my TV, I have a few smart home devices and I have yet to have a good experience setting them up. This light strip was much easier to connect to the app and Alexa but I found that the adhesive strip started to peel off of the light strip instead of just the cover. Not a huge issue but it did make it a little more difficult to get the lights to go in a proper line because of the adhesive strip now folding in on itself. It works great with Alexa and I imagine the Google Assistant works just as well. One downside is the adhesive though, but not too bad to where it’s expected to happen. If I needed more LED Smart light strips I would absolutely buy this again, they were easy to connect to the app and they’re easy to get to stick.

  This product is great, but one of my main complaints is the color. the colors aren't necessarily impressively accurate. yellow is too neon looking, white is too blue, and you can't get a normal color like a warm white for a calm look, you can really only get intense neon-bright colors. the app isn't great either, the color wheels and sliders are wildly inaccurate.

They can work, but hit or miss since this LED tape is not stiff enough to insert and make a tight connection.Follow the video for 'looped' corners, you'll be so much happier and reduce the install stress immensely.if you are insistent on flat squared off corners, if can be done, but you'll need patience and extra LED tape and parts, for those that don't cooperate.

  We originally purchased these lights for undercounted lights no in our kitchen. They were horrible for the purpose. There is no way to get a warm white. We have philips house light strips and the builder installed ones and neither have this problem. You get weird cold light with rainbow bits. You can see the different colors against the wall.  Also, as soon as I unrolled them and plugged them in three of the lights were a totally different color from the rest. We have installed them in our kids game room and they like playing with them but more of the lights have changed since installation. They still light they are just a totally different color. They are above the window frame 9 feet in the air so they aren’t being tampered with. These lights are a fun if you only want color changing lights. Not for regular household use.

  The second half of the strip (further away from the power connection) is visibly less bright. I do not think this is expected. As well, turning off/on the lights from the app after prolonged time (lets say an hour) requires issuing the command 2 times. The first always fails. Adding the item in Google Home was easy, however it does not respond to physical (app clicks) or voice commands through Google Home.Increasing my stats to 4 since the voice functionality started working.

  I tried finding a long, LED strip that works with some sort of app, and must work with my alexa. I found that this strip was everything i needed except for one thing, the length is way too short. I assumed the length would at least reach to the end of the wall, but as seen i forgot to account for the need to run up the wall first. Obviously if there was an option that would contain a longer cord, I would love to see it! As of now the only thing that it seems i can do is buy another strip, and connect it to the back end of the first one. Even though i don't know how exactly to do it given there are no steps in the manual in case i would need to do such a thing, but lets hope a few you tube videos will help me out. For the future, maybe including a guide on how to do something like this would be extremely helpful, and i encourage anyone this is so kind as to assist me on how to do it. Thank YouEDIT : After purchasing another led strip but the 30ft long one, I have realized maybe including some sort of male to female connector, because i received two strips with a power plug that can connect to two individual led strips. This would allow me to connect both of course, but i was trying to make my first 16 ft led strip cable connect to the end of the cables i bought from the 30ft pack. It didn't work. Yes it did actually light up correctly when i touched the pins to the little bits of metal at the end of the strip, and responded EXACLY how it needed to, but you cannot connect them. Its literally impossible without some sort of adapter. a small plug that would connect the end of one strip to the beginning of another would be so helpful. Not even electrical tape did the job, there needs to be a certain amount of pressure to keep the connection, and it just wasn't working. Please add some adapters, it would literally be so useful.

Within a week, however, the lights on the tv stopped working and would only go red. What is the point of RBG if it can only do R??? And then about two months later the lights slowly started losing the wifi and bluetooth connection. Now none of them will connect to wifi which means they cannot be controlled by Alexa.

  Absolutely in love with the way the lights look on the back of my TV. I have a plain white wall and the lights make it not so boring. The application was easy and fast. I usually turn them on/off from my phone really convenient that they are Wi-Fi. I was worried that I would need 2 packs because of the size of my TV but only a small portion was left without lights. I have a 75"" TV. I love the lights so much I bought some warm light ones for underneath my kitchen cabinets. Can't wait to see how those turn out.

  We ordered these to go on the back of our 75” theater room tv. First of all, the installation couldn’t be easier. Took a couple minutes to stick on and plug in. The app is easy to use and allows you to make your own color selections on the color wheel. Second, the quality/brightness of the color options are awesome. Even against a black shiplap background, they pop. Third, the price can’t be beat. These are much less expensive than the competitor and in my opinion, just as good. Do yourself a favor and purchase if you’re thinking about it!

  Like others I bought this item to use with Alexa, voice controlled. Unfortunately I took the risk as I usually don’t have the same experience with connection issues like other consumers. I’ve bought products that talked about connection problems but were just fine. Well.... on this product it isn’t the case. I could get the WiFi working for a few mins and could use with Alexa every since then it won’t connect via WiFi. If you want to use with Alexa I suggest to keep looking. Paid the little extra to work with Alexa but as of now it’s been a complete waste of money.

  I had imagined these to be chunkier and harder to work with but it turned out to be a breeze! I really appreciate the alcohol wipe and included clips. I stuck these across the back side and around the entire inside of my metal desk and the adhesive stuck very well to the smooth surface. I had never worked with LED strips before so I was worried I might mess something up but it was all very easy, even the 90 degree turns. I’m also surprisingly happy with the music sync setting, something I thought I’d never use.The app does well and I appreciate a lot of the settings. It could use some work here and there but overall no worse than other similar apps I use and nothing that would be a deal breaker or prevent me from using these how I’d like.I ordered a second set for my other desk and plan on coming back to these in the future if I ever want more.

   Bought the 16.4in Goove LED lights for my 55 in Vizio TV & it was the perfect size for me. I posted a pic of some of the strip that came off, which I will save just in case. I did not use the hooks but I may or may not use them later on. I simply curved the corners as much as I could with my fingers obviously using the non-adhesive part. I did see videos of how to cut the strip to make the curve but it came out perfect just curving like I did on my other strip. If you do end up cutting it, cut the middle of the cooper part that has a little scissor symbol on it to show you wear to cut. I absolutely love this LED light strip! I did A LOT of reach on it after getting a cheap waterproof one from Walmart. I have to say this paper one is wayyyy much better! It was super easy to install & as much I kept messing with it to get the same amount of brightness in each side & make sure each side was even, the adhesive still stuck to the tv(I prevented touching the adhesive as much as I could) and the lights are just as bright even with messing with it for a while. Goes to show the lights are great quality!Installing the Goove app, adding my Google Home device with the lights was super easy(about 15 minutes). The fact that I can talk to my Google Assistant & have the lights react to my demand is super cool. I love all the modes sooo much!! The music mode is so awesome, I love how the lights goes with the rhythm of the music. Not using a remote control to change the colors & settings feels sooo nice.. I can either use my phone, my Google Assistant, or the adapter on the lights to control what I want to change.HIGHLY RECOMMEND!

This thing comes with a nice long cord, and the hardware has sticky tape all over it, making mounting a snap.  Support gets back to you fast.

  I ordered two of these to backlight my bookshelves. Both strips arrived on time and the product was as advertised! Installation was easy and the adhesive sticks very good to smooth surfaces. For my setup I only needed one strip, which I cut in half, but I did need 2 controllers to power both pieces. Once it was installed, I was left with an entire unused strip for a different project but no adapter to power it. So I reached out to Govee technical support via email, inquiring how I can obtain just the power adapter/controller. Support replied in the timely manner saying that unfortunately, the power adapters/controllers are not sold separately. They did ask me why I needed the separate adapter and, after I explained it, they offered to send the adapter free of charge! I didn't even ask for it but they just went above and beyond to make sure their customer was happy! Now that is what I call a great customer service! Great Job, Govee!

  These lights did exactly what I wanted, and I liked that I could connect them to my Alexa and an app on my phone. Installation was simple, just peel the backing off and stick to your wall or wherever. The tape was very sticky. Connecting the lights to my app on my phone as well as my Alexa was also very simple. The lights are bright and you can select exact shades, adjust the brightness, and they even connect to music. My only complaint is that for the music, it only lights up or changes colors when the beat drops very low; they do not stay on for the entire song.

They have a decent brightness to them although they probably could be a bit more lit up. The ONE thing I absolutely hate is that there is no fade option...that I can find. The WiFi/ Bluetooth sometimes acts up. There have been a few times where they turned on themselves which scared me lol. The app needs some improvement but overall I love it & they update it at times with new stuff. I highly recommend to look into other LED lights especially if you like the fade effect. Groove is an decent place to buy from. As with anything, do your research and know what you’re buying.

  I love these lights, however i have yet been able to instal to my Alexa, it just wont connect. the remote from my phone is awesome. does take a sec to connect at first then after it changes pretty quickly i did set up lights on a timer and they work perfect on the timer. the adhesive was pretty good but it does get loose. the box came with add on adhesive stickers that you can even screw on. I just used the sticker and it hasnt fallen yet. I plan to buy more for around the house but it lights the kitchen great and it looks so modern with just the touch of colorful lights.

  Put these lights around my sons bed and connected with an Alexa Dot - they look great.  The instructions that came with the Govee Strip will tell you how to connect - Your Amazon Dot has Govee listed under lights to connect as well.  If you don't have an Amazon Dot to connect to the lights still plug into the wall for a great show.

  Son muy buenas luces y con muy buena calidad, Tienen una cantidad inmensa de scenes y se pueden agregar colores propios. Las tengo configuradas para que se enciendan en una hora determinada del dia y se apaguen por si solo. Incluso cuando se corta la energia electrica, no se desconfiguran y funcionan super bien.Pongo 4 estrellas porque cuando se corta la energia electrica, se encienden, aun si yo las tengo apagadas, y eso no me agrada mucho. Pero por lo demas, son unas excelentes luces.

I haven’t explored Alexa and the scenes yet..It was easy to install and I honestly should have checked all the colors before I stuck them to the wall.They were easy to sync with Alexa but you also need to download the Govee app.Syncs to music pretty fine as well .

   I bought this product to add some mood lighting to my bedroom. I was able to quickly add it to my Google Home for voice control. Much more affordable than other options. This didn't come with a remote control, but I wasn't actually looking for one. I wanted something that would integrate with my Google Home for voice control using the Google Assistant. The instructions to connect were easy to follow. The music sync was a nice, unexpected bonus, but your phone must be in Bluetooth mode (as opposed to Wi-Fi mode) to use this and other options. You can control color, brightness and timer issues when it's in Wi-Fi mode. Great purchase. Will buy again for other parts of the home.

    LEDs have begun failing after about a month and a half.
  
",2.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States August 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  I really liked the way these look, and the color options and alexa voice controls were cool, but the blue leds started to fail after about 1.5 months. I would turn them on for a few hours at a time, and eventually the leds started dying and discoloring in patches of three at a time. As you can see in the photo, I had the color set to 'purple', and there are orange patches on the side and bottom of the window where the leds are dying. I can still set it to other colors and avoid the issue, but the purple was my favorite :( and it seems the quality of these isn't very great so more LEDs will begin to discolor and die as I use it. It broke just past the return window so unfortunately I'm stuck with these.Make sure you invest in better ones because the installation process takes a long time and you don't want to put all that effort in just for them to break.

  This is my second Govee Smart RGB Led Strip Lights.  Previously I purchased the 32 feet one, and was very happy with it's performance and look.1) Strong adhesion2) Bright lights3) Easy pairing with phone4) Intuitive integration with Google homeThe integration with google home is solid - I don't need to use my phone to control it, since I can say a command from any google home device around the house.  The one thing I don't believe can be controlled with voice command is the ""Party Lights"" setting, where the light changes based on sound.  I can do that from the app, although it would risk seizure after the lights flicker in different colors for an extended amount of time :).  It's a fun feature though.My first LED strip, I set up in my kids room.  I decided to use this purchase in the kitchen (under the cabinets).  I found that in a room the light strength is greater than an open space like a kitchen.  The light distribution is not as strong in the kitchen under a cabinet compared to kids bedroom ceiling.  Perhaps if Govee had a version with LED lights that are less spaced out that would be a better fit.I had an issue with one of the strips, and after troubleshooting with Govee support via their app, they ended up sending me a replacement strip right away - which was greatly appreciated.Overall, this is fun product.  Great for ambiance color/light, as well as fun for kids rooms and the like.  I have stuck with Govee, since their products have been consistent and reliable.

After about a couple month I had an issue with the lights when i change  it to certain colors a few of the LED were not the same colors as it suppose to be so I reached out to Govee via their app and got a quick response they ask me to try a couple steps to see if i can get the lights back in sync but it didn't work then they ask for my Amazon order number, without me even asking about warranty or a replacement they were kind and understanding enough and I received a replacement about a week later. To me that is great customer service and because this experience with Govee and to know that when you buy their product via their app you have that kind of support I will be definitely be more of their product in the future.

  !UPDATE! Do not buy if you want long lasting led lights. These did not even last a year of regular use. First they stopped doing certain colors like green, yellow, white. Then they just stopped working. Had them around my desk. No crazy bends or anything and has always been dry. Had all wires secured safely. Had them turned off every night and didnt use them every day either so it's not like I left them on all the time. Look else where for led strips.OLD REVIEWI have these leds around my desk and they look awesome. Installation was no problem as the adhesive stuck right on. Theres is a remote attached were you can control the color, brightness, power on/off, and turn on/off microphone sensitivity. This is also were the mic is at. The app works great as well but is way better then the remote. You can change to any color and there are many effects you can use. From strobes to fades you name it. Simply awesome. Ive had them a few months and have had no problems. Would recommend.

  First light strip bought, and the blue color went bad in a day. Amazon replaced it. The blue went bad a couple of days later, and Govee replaced light strips. A month later the blue lights went bad again. When the lights go bad they do not light back up. So if you are using blue color there are patches in the strip with missing light. If you are using a color that using blue for shading you will have mismatched colors in light strip. I am not first customer to complain of this issue. Annoying that Amazon and Govee continue to sell a product they know is defective.

  Why won't the lights work? I've followed the instructions line by line. I have the app and I have connected them to an outlet; I also made sure it was bluetooth paired for the app, and that the wifi info was set up. The most light I get are barely detectable faint blue lights on the 4 most recent ""bulbs"" near the electrical outlet, which aren't bright enough to project any color or light onto the hand holding them. This faint light I'm referring to also disappears within seconds...I kid you not. I almost thought I was imagining it but I was able to replicate the incident without any rhyme or reason, confirming that there was something going on with that faint blue light. I've tried multiple outlets too. Nothing works so far. I'm a fairly tech savy person, so I'm shocked these aren't working with so many good reviews. This is also my second strip with this exact issue...I had a replacement shipped. Maybe customer service can troubleshoot the issue with me and hopeful this is just a user error where I need help. Otherwise, I'll be forced to return both of these.

   Wow! INSTANT UPGRADE TO ANY ROOM!Whether it’s a gaming room, your bedroom, a man cave, home theatre...kitchen, seriously any room these can elevate the entire room!When installing I noticed how the adhesive strip was 3M and super high quality! I had no problems sticking them to the back outline of my desk and television and everything stayed in place perfectly without the included clips!The brightness is awesome and in a darker room or at night absolutely pop! My neighbor said my bedroom looked like a disco at night seeing the lights radiate from my window! The remote control lets your control the colors, patterns of blinking and speeds! Basically everything you can want and a crazy good value for how nice these are!10/10 recommend!

  We loved the quality of the light when it worked but after being on for 5 minutes it would trip our breaker. I thought it was a defective item so I returned and purchase another Govee light strip with the same issues. We then tested our outlet and breakers and it was fine with everything except the Govee lights. Not sure why as we loved how the app and lights looked. I wonder if anyone else had power issues with this product?

",1.0,Tater,"Reviewed in the United States July 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  Having lots of experience with smart home automation & devices, I have to conclude that this product is a Major FAIL! This product is not Alexa friendly & refuses to connect to the 2.4 GHz band on the WiFi ( it is also NOT compatible with the 5 GHz) Even the Bluetooth is a blunder & keeps becoming unresponsive! Had the bluetooth feature alone at least been “stable”, I probably would have kept them. ( simply because I Hate returning items & would have made do with it) Also these are NOT waterproof & have lousy adhesive... Not such a bargain after all. Actually they are way over priced for such a cheap & cheesy product!

  After about a week of use the strip will not show the color red at all. So that means no red, purple or orange. And yellow is more of a green than a yellow. It’s bright and it was easy to put up but if you lose a primary color that affects a bunch of other color options. Pretty disappointed.

  First of all, I adore how easy it was to install and have it stick. I think I would need two people to rip this off its so strong when it sets. I love the lights, colors and patterns you can program it to.Now here is where I really really dislike this product.The remote is an app from the app store and its nonstop ads. I shouldn't have you selling out to spam me with ads every time I go to turn my lights on, its highly annoying and I mis-click all the time and it brings me to sketch sites and I hate that.Biggest concern I have is when the product is off, it makes a annoying, loud buzzing noise constantly. Im pretty worried about leaving it plugged in when its not on or I leave the house, it feels like a fire hazard in the outlet making this noise. Big 2 stars off for it as its annoying to constantly plug in when I want it on.

  I initially thought that the individual light strips were very well made, but now after returning 2 different sets that suffered from the same problem, I am convinced there are better options out there. The WiFi controller and app are really cool and I had no problem connecting it to Alexa. My problem was with the quality of the individual light strips themselves. My original strip and the replacement they sent me both had failures after a hard-soldered seam, i.e. the thick silver connection that is every-so-often along the strip. The three LEDs immediately following this seam failed and would not change to the correct colors, if they lit up at all. My project has 2 runs, so counting the replacement, that's 4 segments of their lights that all had the same malfunction. Not sure if it's a bad batch or what, but I'm moving on to a different brand.Light it up, folks. :)

  This is an updated review, as the first set of lights that came in had a number of LEDs toward the beginning that were stuck on a green color, and this was really annoying. Fortunately, Govee sent me a new set of lights, and these no longer had that problem. Needless to say, they're customer service is amazing (really quick and responsive)! The only thing I was not such a big fan of was the color of the white light, which is this strange bluish/white color. On the other hand, these lights can get pretty bright. So if you're looking for something that can easily bright up a room, then this Govee is definitely the way to go!

   I have some others, but trying to make the odd shaped loop to get them to take a corner under my desk caused it to split in a section and the light colors be off. I ordered these and bought L brackets as well. Not only did these adhere much better to the bottom of my desk, but not having the clear gel coating made it possible to use L brackets on the corners. I tested the lights before installing them with brackets on. Setup was easy and integration with Alexa works like a charm. The only thing I wish they had was a chasing pattern or marquee pattern. Overall I am very happy with how these turned out and would recommend getting these for any underneath installation. Good bright colors that are easy to adjust. I made a color fade with all colors except white in the DIY menu.

  Initially,  I was quickly disheartened with these lights. The back of the lights use an adhesive tape like stickiness, and you have to peel off the non-sticky, outer layer. Which worked very well, except that at first i had such a hard time separating the outer layer to expose the sticky part that I ended up accidentally removing the sticky part altogether (about the first foot or so). Luckily it came with a few extra clips as well so this was fixable. Now the remote.... this thing is seriously cheap looking/feeling. It has 3 buttons; ""on/off,"" ""change color(solid),"" and ""change color(music)."" Meaning that with the remote you have no brightness control(keep in mind that LEDs can be pretty light, so you'll likely want to lower the brightness). The ""White light"" function also is not available without the use of the app. With the app however, my experience has been beyond incredible!!! Brightness control has been clutch, and the music setting on the app is far better! Not to mention how many other countless options the app brings to the table.

  These are great for the kids room at night. I can adjust the color brightness from my phone using the app and I can control turning them off and on. The kids love them.We use these every night and they are on for about 8hours straight. The only thing that happened is that 6months into using them like this with only one color, the blue color burnt out on four lights and they are now green. Not a big deal, figured something like this would happen since we used them a lot. I’m not too bugged about buying more if needed bc the price is right!Oh and you do need the little brackets that come with them which help them adhere to the wall especially if you have a wall that’s not totally smooth. I didn’t think we needed them but the stickiness wears off a little over time.

However, the app is not live, meaning you have to set your desired color first on your phones face, then release, then see what you will get.  This is only a matter of a few seconds but still.  Also, the number of shades available is limited to maybe 100.  That sounds like a lot but it can get frustrating when you set you desired shade to a particular color and your result isn’t close.  Still though they do look nice and do not require a “hub” or any other device other than your phone and there are enough colors that you will land in one you like.  The biggest pro is the price which is a third of the Phillips system.

  Bought these for my son for Christmas.  He loves the!  The packaging for this product was sort of bland so when he opened it he wasn’t super excited. But when we went and installed them in his room and turned on the music it was like a dance club in there!  The lights will go to the beat of the music and you can choose any color you want or have changing colors. These are often the only lights he will have on in his room. Highly recommended.

  I purchased these for my son's room and he loved them. The control settings were really great and easily integrated into existing Google Home network. The reason for 4-stars is we did have an issue with some of the LEDs not working anymore after about 4 months of use. I contacted customer service and after explaining the issue they sent me a new replacement. So far so good on the replacement, but will revisit if we have any new issues on the replacement again.

   It has an easy to use app and actually a good enough adhesive on the back. You can easily sync more than one on the app.

  I recently purchased three Grovee lights which work great, especially with the new iPhone! You can have as many lights on one “scene” as you would like. The one under my kitchen island unfortunately just stopped working so I reached out to customer support and Fannie assisted me all the way. Fannie help me try and diagnose the issue, and when that didn’t solve the problem Fannie immediately sent out a replacement no questions asked! Amazing support, superb product guarantee / warranty. I will be purchasing all my lights from Grovee, thanks Fannie!!!

    Don’t buy for the white light

  If you want this for the colorful lights, it’s great. If, like me, you mostly want just soft white light and only occasionally want to use the colors, this is not the product for you. The white light looks awful. Has a greenish tint to it. Mostly useless for me.

  Look amazing and love the glow. The app lets you put a timer on the lights so there’s no need to even mess with them.  They come on at 5pm and go off at 8am. Perfect for me.
