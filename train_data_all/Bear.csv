Bears (yes, I said bears because well I have a problem and I have them all) are super soft and easy to get out of the box, but the collectible coin was in there like Fort Knox not a problem because I have a toddler that I did not want getting that on her own.  These bears are not the same as the original but I think they are better than the originals I just love the colors and expressions.

  Grumpy bear was on special but he is a real treat. The kids love how soft he is and we often talk about what makes us happy and what makes this grumpy. He’s a nostalgic icon from the past and he feels his role wonderfully

  I was reading some of the reviews and it is really unfortunate that some of the customers didn't receive the advertised product nor did they receive the collectible coin. I took a shot on it as a Valentine's Day gift and I received the product (Cheer Bear) in the advertised box with the collectible coin. It was for the girlfriend and was more so going to be a display/collectible item rather than a teddy bear to sleep with. Either way, she loved it, said it was really soft and it's cute. Would recommend.

  The bear was soft and very cuddly. Was highly dissapointed in the packaging. It was a gift for my daughter for her birthday. She likes to keep the boxes for her stuffed animals but the box was crushed and ruined. I had to throw it away. They need to handle things better over there in the warehouse. That box should never have been distributed.

  I noticed that these are priced competitively with other stores, but those other stores were sold out so I came here to complete my set of Care Bears.  These also make great gifts to give others.  They came well packaged and then wrapped again with plastic on the outside during a pandemic, which is a plus.  They also come with a special collector's coin, with the same or similar color as the bear.  I'd highly recommend these as gifts or as ""visuals"" for those who need comfort, self-care, and/or stress-relievers.  As a side note: During this pandemic, I store the incoming items I've removed from the main package into a secure place inside my apartment and wait three days before use.  I also use either Lysol spray or Tide antibacterial fabric spray to pretreat these after I've waited three days, just to make sure they are clean and germ-free before use during a pandemic.  I am high-risk and therefore do what I can to make sure that anything I purchase is cleaned and disinfected before use.  It's just an added step that could reduce risk of any infection during a pandemic.  The extra care that went into packaging this item was impressive, however.  I knew I was receiving a new and carefully packaged product.  I received the same type of packaging from one other company that sold Care Bears as well.  I'm wondering if they come direct from the factory with plastic bag coverings outside of the bear boxes.

EXCEPT it smells like a fish factory 😫 it has the faint smell of rotten fish on it. I don’t want to deal with returning because my husband works 14+ hours a day and it sucks trying to take my kids and 3 month old out (especially with COVID-19!)... is I throw it in the washing machine, will it ruin its fur???

Well it was the wrong bear they had reviewed or something because mine is in a collector box which he will stay in. He’s gorgeous like all the carebears. I’m going to get the rest of them now just going to make sure it’s this specific brand. Thanks love how cute it is and the size of the bear is great snd love the box!

  These are awesome. Only complaint is my pink one came with what I would call a ""fake"" version on the coin. The others are solid and you can tell they are metal and good quality. For some reason my pink came with one that feels like plastic. Considering I'm collecting these in super disappointed it's different sub par to the rest but honestly only complaint. Good Size, soft and super cute.

  Tenderheart arrived yesterday, he's very soft, nicely made, cute as hecc, and is my second of the bigger Care Bear plush by Basic Fun. If you like Care Bears I highly recommend these plush, they're soft, cuddly and adorable! I'm planning on getting the rest of the set too!

  Share Bear is very soft, huggable, and well-made. She comes with a metallic purple coin with her face on it and a cute way to help care for those around you. She is definitely worth every cent, and I'll be getting the rest of the set as well!

  Es el 4to care bear que compraba y los tres anteriores venían en su bolsa sellada, este llego sin bolsa, y el muñeco sin los sellos que los fijan a la caja, ojo con esto en ningún lado decía que fuera usado, estoy pensando en iniciar una devolución, porque son de colección para mi esposa y sin los sellos no valen nada, muy lamentable porque los muñecos si que valen la pena

  I bought ""Good Luck Care Bear""for my 6 years old granddaughter.  He favorite color is green.  She wanted a green ""happy face"" teddy to snuggle and sleep with.  She is very happy with Good Luck Care Bear, gave it a very nice name fitting for the color.  My granddaughter  ""calls the teddy her ""forever"" teddy.  Earlier we bought her 3 years old sister  ""Cheer Bear"" and the 3 year loves it. !!

  Wayyyyyy softer than expected. I’m very happy with this. It’s adorable and good for any child who loves the show. Also comes with a collectible coin which is cool but might be a choking hazard for really little kids. But the bear itself is well worth it
