",5.0,April,"Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  This product has been great so far. It charges my controllers quickly, the display is bright and it's very easy to determine whether they are charged or not. The only thing is that because the charger is very narrow, I feel like I have to be careful when placing the controllers on there. I have accidentally turned the PS4 back on before, and also dont want to mess up the port which sticks off of the base by not being careful.

",5.0,Amazon shopper,"Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I don’t like paragraphs, so here we go:- Multiple remotes: If you have a PlayStation and you have multiple remotes, believe me, you need this.- Charge indicator: The red light comes on as soon as you plug in a remote that needs charging. The remote lights up, charges, and then the green light on the charger comes on letting you know it is ready to go.- Speed of charge: The PlayStation remotes seem to charge at the same speed as they would with the wire, which is good because you don’t want to overcharge your battery or burn it up.- Space: This charge is a great size and it can fit right with everything else in your home entertainment center. It does not look like something misplaced because it is small and black.- Bottom line: You need this if you have two or more remotes. You probably can actually get two if you have 4 remotes just to move things along quicker.

    A good charger but could be better
  
",5.0,R. Sherman,"Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this and I don't have any real misgivings about buying it.  It works and one of it's features I really like is that when you plug in a dead controller it shows a red light to indicate which controller is presently charging.  I like that.  What is a constant annoyance is when I have to plug it in it's a bit of a ""lets jiggle the controller until it actually sits on the charging plug correctly"" dance.  A minor inconvenience, but still annoying.  They could have done a better design job to ensure a more seamless transition for charging.  This thing is sturdy, has some decent weight to it, doesn't move all over and I really like the light indicators which stay on.  I'd buy again for a cheap price.

  I've only had it for a month in July of 2020, so I have no idea how well it will last in the year(s) ahead, but this has solved the issue of my children plugging in and unplugging controllers without damage.

  I still use this device to this day, it honestly saves so much time when using multiple controllers. There’s that time when your controller dies mid game, swap it real quick and charge it. It’s responsive, easy to use and charges rapidly.

  works, but the front indicators are always green, even if nothing is plugged in.  They worked for a day or two then it just stuck on green.  It makes it hard to tell where the charge status is for the controllers - if they were just plugged in or fully charged.  Otherwise they work.

",1.0,Max Sullivan,"Reviewed in the United States January 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  I like how you can fit two controllers in a small area and they are kept tidy, however I've gone through two units and neither work correctly.The first unit would only charge a controller in port #2. I've tried switching controllers in case there was an issue with the controller, but only port #2 would charge a controller.  Port #1 would remain lit (green light on face turned on), but would never switch to red to indicate charging like port #2 would.  The indicator light on the controller indicating the controller was charging wouldn't light up either when plugged into port #1. Tried replacing the USB cable that connects the charging station to no avail.After troubleshooting the 1st unit with no luck, I requested a replacement from Amazon. Amazon shipped a replacement out quickly and I received it the next day.  Unfortunately the replacement charging station had the same problem, except with the ports reversed.  Port #2 wouldn't charge anything and port #1 would charge a controller, but only for a few minutes at a time.At this point I've given up on this charging station and have requested a refund.  I suggest you do the same!

  My young kids jacked up the micro USB charging ports on the front of the controllers. This charging station was a life saver. The charging ports are much more durable, easier for them to seat to charge, and has the red/green indicator for charging. This was an excellent investment from keeping me having to go buy new PS4 controllers due to the micro USB ports breaking. I highly recommend this above using the standard charging ports.

  I got this because it seemed like a good black Friday deal. When I received the first one it light up with little green controllers and I put one of the controllers on there and let it sit overnight to charge. I immediately noticed that the light didn’t change to red indicating it was charging but decided to wait and see. The next morning the controller was still dead. So I started my return and it gave the option for a replacement. I decided to give them the benefit of the doubt that maybe that one was defective but no, I had the same issue.I only wanted a new one because the base of my old one broke, the charger still works but only on one side. Looks like I’ll be going back to that brand instead.

  This product only comes with the dock and a very short USB charge cable. You either have to have a USB wall charger already or if you're like me I had to to purchase additional ones. Due to the extremely short cable I had to purchase a longer one so I could put the charger where I wanted it in my entertainment center. For me I would have been better off spending more money and purchasing a different one that came with an actual power adapter since with all the extra purchases I made I spent the same amount.

",1.0,RInteriano,"Reviewed in the United States July 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  **edit**I wanted to give this a 5 star rating but all of a sudden the front charging port is defective and will not charge either of the controllers. The back one works great. Every time I pick up a dead controller off of the defective port I am irritated. The reason it is so irritating is because there is no response from the seller regarding this issue, AND NOW I see that this device is recommended by Amazon! Are you joking?? All these reviews stating the device is defective and you’re still recommending this product? I am a prime member, but this product broke just after the return deadline. BTW We purchased this June 2020. It’s July 2020. Do not purchase.

  I think this product is perfect. I rotate two controllers so it does its job. My only gripe is the cord could be longer so that you can plug it into an outlet instead of the ps4 because when its off they don't charge. But you can just buy a charger for it thats longer.

    Great Charger
  
",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States September 27, 2017","









  
  
    
  This is a great charger, it charges the PS4 controllers through the mic input at the bottom of the controller instead of the USB port at the top. This is useful for controllers that have gone dead and cannot be recharged, which is the reason I bought this in the first place. I was able to revive a dead controller that I had otherwise given up on. The only thing I did not like about it was that its power cord is a simple USB plugin rather than a real power adapter that goes into a wall socket. I was expecting it to plug into a power outlet so that I wouldn't have to charge my controllers from my PS4. However, a convenient workaround for this is to get a power adapter for USBs that plug into a wall socket. So instead of charging my controllers through my PS4 or PC, I can plug the USB end of the charger into a power adapter that plugs into the wall. I would definitely recommend this charger.

  For just over twelve bucks, this thing does exactly what I wanted it to do.Previously, I had always had a USB charging cord awkwardly draped from the front of my system to one of the controllers I haphazardly tossed on top.  The great thing about this device, for me, was just that it made it easy to run a cord BEHIND my entertainment system and into a wall socket and created a perfectly organized place to store my controllers. It charges both controllers too, and the light-up-display is neat and all, but since they now rest in this dock when not in use, I feel like they will NEVER be low on battery.It even freed up a little more space on my entertainment center so that I have a more convenient place to store my tv remote.It's not groundbreaking technology, but it is helpful and it makes it easier to have a clean and organized look for your gaming space.

    This charger is NOT a drop in charger.
  
",4.0,Chuck Chapman,"Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2021","









  
  
    
  I wanted a drop in charger like Nyko makes. I found this charger and reviewed all material and all photos and could not determine if it was drop in or not. Since it's shell design looked similar to the Nyko drop in I decided to purchase it. While this device is a great charger, it is NOT a drop in charger. It utilizes the rear ports on the DulaShock controllers instead of the front micro USB. It is still a plug in charger. My reason for wanting a drop in charger was to eliminate the wear and tear of plugging and unplugging the controllers from the charger. I could have just plugged a USB splitter into the PS4 or even a wall outlet and used a micro USB charging cable for the same effect.

  Seems to interact negatively with the PS4. When I plug this in it will continually spit out whatever disc is I the console, when this triggers your PS4 will go from whatever state it was in to the home screen, shutting down any applications that require the disc.

   This works exactly as I had hoped it would. The last charging cord got destroyed when the robot vacuum ran it over, so I opted for something that would charge both controllers at the same time, so we could alternate. Bonus, that the lights indicate when the controller is charged. Side note, I have a toddler who likes to play with the controllers, and has actually dropped the charging station (on the second day we had this) and caused something to come loose, but it still works.

  For some reason, it's been really difficult to find a high quality charger for PS4 remotes.

  This is very useful when the ports on the back of the controllers are loosened enough to prevent charging that way. This charger uses the port on the front of the controller instead, so I no longer need to struggle with getting the other port on the controller to work. Just be very careful with the charging cable port on this unit, as it can become loosened too. Now I never use this device's cable for anything else, so as to not loosen the port.

  Like many of aftermarket chargers out there - it just doesn't last.  I probably wouldn't be writing this review if the charger had made it 6 months.  But here we are, 1 week later, and my *new* PS4 Dualshock controllers will not charge when docked.  In fact, it shows green lights (indicating that they're charged).  However, the PS4 shows that they are not charged when viewing the charge status on the actual PS4.  Waste of money, and another cheap plastic item tossed into the ever-growing landfill. I'll gladly pay twice this amount for a charger that holds up for a year.

  I bought this as a surprise gift for my son. Although he never asked for a charging dock I felt that it would be very handy to have one place where you can charge both your controllers simultaneously rather than having to switch the charging cable between two different controllers. The shipping was prompt and item arrived well packaged. My son (13yrs) was able to unpack and set it up all by himself. I think he had a little help from the instructions included with the product but for the most part it was pretty straight forward. The build quality of the dock exceeded my expectations considering how much I paid for it. It works well with both controllers and the little icons in the front can tell you if any of the controller is not docked correctly which could happen occasionally if you are in a hurry. Overall I am very satisfied with this product and how it has worked so far. Will definitely recommend this product to anyone looking for PS4 controller charging dock.

  This charger is perfect for the space we have! It’s really easy to place the PS4 controllers on the charger and remove them. The front shows a green (fully charged) or red (not fully charged) light so my son can easily tell when they are done charging and ready for use. We had the stackable charger before and it was too tall and much harder to plug in the controllers.

  Because i have three controllers i needed to have a means to easily keep them charged up as often only one will be in use at any time, thus having a dual charger that does the job and looks well and needs only one USB slot is why I purchased this unit and it uses the better connectionat the rear  than the small SONY type plug at the front .  The charge indication lights are also a good thing to have a syou get a view of what is being charged

    Initial Review After 1 Month - So Far So Good
  
",5.0,Klinton,"Reviewed in the United States June 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is an initial review after 1 month of usage.So far so good.It has bean nearly 1 whole month and I have yet to have any issues with this product.It seems to be working fine for me being plugged into one of the USB ports on the front of my PS4 Pro and is capable of charging both controllers at the same time.Charge time on the controllers seems to be fine as well, doesn't seem to be the fastest charge, but not the slowest either so no complaints there.I will say that when plugging them in, the plastic piece that goes into the bottom port of your controller in order to supply power to it is a little bit of a tight fit, however I believe that with time and more plugging and unplugging, I will be able to break it in a little bit and soften the tightness of the fit making it easier to slide on and off of the connector.Build quality is as you would expect from a product like this, it's light weight and cheap plastic, but that's OK in my opinion based on the price you are paying as well as the fact that it really should only be sitting in one spot not being moved around once you get it plugged in.The front two LED lit images of a controller are green when not charging, and turn red when they are letting me know it's charging properly, coupled with the fact that my controllers light bar will pulsate orange to let me know it's charging as well.I have not tried plugging this unit into any other kind of USB port such as a wall adapter and honestly, I wouldn't want to try and risk such a thing in the event that it might fry something because of the fact that this is such a budget product, so far just having it plugged into one of the front USB ports on my PS4 is causing no issues, and I would suggest doing the same, and if you need more USB ports on your console you should just get a USB hub to plug into the second remaining port on the console.All in all it works as it should and I have had no issues with it after 1 month.If anything happens within the next month or two, I will update my review.Thanks for reading.

Turns out this one is a lot better. It has multicolored lights, a fast charge, and an easy to use design. I have to admit I like this one a lot more than my last one.Pros:Easy to use and a very sleek and simple design.Cons:If you hate lights in your room, (like I do) you will hate how bright the charging lights are at night. It’s really annoying and disruptive. It also hinders immersive gameplay in the dark.5/5 Stars for the brightest controller dock known to man.

  I am not real sure about this charger.  The USB Charger card is SHORT, really short if you are wanting to leave them by the TV, an extra foot would have been great, I had to dig a cord out of the spare wire box.  Its tricky putting the controllers on there.  My husband has a VR storage rack in the other room and they clip right into that one., but this one takes effort.  I clipped both controllers into it and it showed Green lights right away, and I am pretty sure one wasn't fully charged.  My assessment:  Its just OK, and its cheap. If it gets a red light when charging and gives a good battery life, I'll come back and give it another star.

  So my first impression of this product was that it wasn't going to work, but it does.I ordered it as a Christmas gift and was somewhat disappointed by the packaging and then the fact the product was so light I wondered if it would even work, but it did!Controllers were always misplaced and would only be charged one at a time before but now both controllers (or 1 separately) can charge together and you only need to plug 1 cord into the back of the charger itself.  There are also indicator lights showing the status of the charge. How you ""dock"" your charger initially concerned me as well because it's a pretty small piece for such a large controller,  but again no issues in actual use.Overall I would say this is great in being a life to: keep controllers charged by using 1 cord, has helped keep them together (4 kid household and they dock them when done playing now), looking decent while charging.

I just bought it recently so will update if there's any issues. It was simple to use and set up. Keep in mind the cord is not very long, luckily for me I had a spare one that was long enough to reach an outlet with a phone charger box (if you are going to plug it in on the wall mount instead of directly to the game system USB slot). IF THIS MAKES ANY SENSE HAHA.07/27/2020: Update, both of my controllers are acting like they are possessed when I play. It won't let me move my character around the direction i want... now i am constantly fighting with my controller. THIS NEVER HAPPENED until I started to use this charger. I wish I could send it back.

  I bought this little guy because my regular cables wouldn't charge my controllers and it was a great purchase! It's small so you can store it wherever and it lights up while charging so you know it's working. My only complaint is that it can be tricky to correctly place the controller on the prongs and then you also need to make sure it's actually connected, but not a big deal in my opinion. Would totally buy again.

  I bought this and a new controller. Charged the new controller on it and it will no longer sync or stay on. Do not buy. Just use the cord to charge your controllerUPDATE: If this happens I found a solution to fix it. Take the dock set the controller in the dock while the dock is plugged it. Take the charging cable plug it into the PS4 and while the controller is setting in the charging dock plug the charging cable into it as well so that you’ve got two different sources of charge and then the controller will automatically sync and turn on with the PS4.

  Product arrived on time. Does not include a plug in for wall outlet, just a USB cord, which is disappointing since devices like these should always come with one. Charging indicating lights are simple but one issue I've had on initial use is the lights keep switching back and forth between red and green. The instructions are so brief and basic it does not indicate what this means and I can't tell if its actually charging, having an issue, or fully charged. I only just set this up so an update on my review might come later.Overall the product seems simple, easy to set up, and works, but lacks a wall plugin, instruction manual is so brief and basic when issues come up they are useless.It isn't a bad buy for the price I paid (on sale). There are likely better options out there but the sale price was hard to pass up when paired with the customer reviews.

  This is definitley suited for certain remotes. If you buy a name brand remote, you will be fine... but if you get an off-brand remote, make sure it has the slot on the bottom of the remote that will attach to the charger... or this wont be useful... I had to give it to my sister who happened to have 2 remotes that could fit it. But... the charger itself works well, is handsomely constructed, and my sister has no complaints.

This remote does not fit on this charging station. It is nowhere near the same set up. Having never purchased these things before I didnt realize that was something I needed to pay attention to.

  I ordered this since I needed something more sturdy & easier to use so my kids can charge their wireless PS4 controllers. It arrived in great condition & looks exactly like the picture above. Easy to read/understand light up controller symbols to let you know when controllers are ready. It does not use batteries so you need to plug in the usb cord to the base and plug into PS4 or if your tv has a USB port then you can plug it there. The only downside is that since it does use a USB port to charge up the controllers, the power source that you have the base connected to needs to be on in order for it to work. So just keep that in mind if you plug it into the PS4. Other than that it’s a pretty good charger.

The only downside I've had is that sometimes they can be tricky to remove with one hand, but that is down to the relative newness of mine and how firmly I put the controllers on the cradle. 9.8/10!

  I purchased this 4 months ago and it works great to charge my controller's. It charges from the front of the controller and doesn't use the micro USB on the back. The main problem I run into with these types of chargers is it tends to break the micro USB but because you're using the port on the front it works allot better-putting the controllers into the base station.

  I have Ps4 controllers with broken charging ports and can no longer charge through cords. This was a saving grace for me because now I have a way to play on my ps4 again. I definitely can tell that it stay alive much longer than if charged by the cord and also appears to charge much faster as well but that may just be because of the fact you can't properly use the controller while its charging.

  I’ve used the charging station once now.  I used a front USB port from the front of my PC.  I use my controllers on my PS4 Pro(in the same room).  The dock had a red controller icon show up on the dock front as soon as it was attached.  The next day when I let it charge overnight the icons were green.  I didn’t measure the time it took to charge.  I will update if any issues appear.

  I have purchased the product recently and it came quite fast and looked perfect. The product design was good and the way controllers sit on the product is very stable and I was really happy with the purchase but unfortunately after few days the charging port started to malfunction and I never actually moved the product it was straight out of box to the wall shelf. I was extremely disappointed and stopped using it since it wasn't charging anymore unless I  hold the charger cable upwards. AND THIS IS THE PART WHERE I BECAME HAPPY AGAIN.And just yesterday I received email about reviewing the product and I wrote almost exactly what I wrote above. And immediately after few minutes I received email from the company's customer service which he/she was concerned about my satisfaction and asked they can make me happy by replacing the product or full refund. And it actually made my day. From time to time I face crappy or defected products from amazon and never received contact back like this. They immediately shipped new product to my address and I am waiting for the non-defected one right now. I really liked the design of this product because the way controllers sit on it seems to be safe for the jack for long term usage and it really is if you purchase it and use it. The charging lights are so useful also. And since they replaced my defected product so fast with quality tested one I have nothing bad to say about this product. GREAT VALUE FOR YOUR MONEY PEOPLE. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLER.

  I read all the great reviews.  Have had mine two weeks and it won't charge anything.  Checked the cord, even bought a new USB for it, didn't fix it.  Even a dead controller, shows green that it's fully charged.  It's such a pain to return such a low ticket item so will just toss and try a different one I guess.

  Bought my son a similar charger for his PS5 and realized just how convenient these things are; ended up buying one for my PS4 Pro. Very happy with this purchase even though I retired it as soon as I got my hands on my own PS5 and bought a charger for that system. What I like about this charger and the one I bought for my PS5 is that it uses the port at the bottom of the controller which makes it much easier to plug in and charge.

Now, this cool looking charger sits right next to my tv with both of my controllers on top and plugged in with the green “fully charged” light on.

  We thought we had 2 controllers that would no longer take a charge. (A $100 problem). We replaced he cables and still no dice. We bought this charger and it turns out it was the warbled-out jacks at the top of the controller. Plugged them in via the bottom jack and wah-lah! Keep them on there now and they are always ready. Love the 2 PS4-shaped red and green colored lights, indicating which controller is charged and which on is not. Great design, maybe the kids won’t destroy this in 10 minutes.

  Works as it's supposed to but you have to get the connections JUST right in order for the controller to actually start charging, sometimes this means wiggling the controller slightly until the light starts flashing.

  This thing charges fast even during gameplay. I'm not even joking, my controller died in the middle of a fight in Monster Hunter (Yes I ignored the ""Almost dead"" notification) that you can't pause so I hurriedly connected the controller to this base and defeated the monster around 10 minutes later. And I am dead serious that it was fully charged and working around 3 or 4 hours after.The only issue With this is that you can't play comfortably with it charging, but if you're daring and lazy like me that won't be an issue.10/10 would buy again if I had more than 2 controllers.

  I have been using Nyko chargers since the PS3 and Xbox 360.They have been great, unfortunately due to design flaws of Sony the newer PS4 chargers forced me to look elsewhere.My micro USB ports have been failing.I do not play with the cords plugged in so that is not the issue.Back to the point... these chargers have offered an alternative to charger via the micro USB ports.I am concerned with long term mounting and dismounting of the controllers, but so far they are working great.Much better than the standard micro USB port.They are easy to dismount, just do not rip them off the charger.I use two fingers to slide the controller up and off the charging port that plugs into the back of the controller towards the user.I would ultimately prefer a design like the Xbox One charging design of just resting the controller on the contacts and the charging contacts on the controller to not be a fragile dongle that wears out the ports.This is Sony's design flaw and not of these charging peripherals.Glad I purchased 3 of these and would recommend.Definitely better than using the micro USB ports that eventually break!

  I bought this because I was tired of having android cables go out on me and on top of that the ports on these controllers can be so finicky. The controllers rest very easily in the stand and charging speed is no different from a hardline. Do keep in kind that if you're planning on keeping this connected to your ps4 they will only charge if it is on or in resting mode, I keep it plugged in to my desktop so this isn't really a problem for me. Overall I'm extremely happy with this purchase.

",3.0,Kris Darty,"Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2019","









  
  
    
  I revived a ""DOBE"" brand charger. Which I guess isn't that bad but I picked this one specifically because it didn't have an obnoxious brand label across the front. I don't see the point in wasting my electricity on the led lights that are used to illuminate some generic brand name. Besides that, there are no 1 and 2 distinctions between the controllers as shown in the pictures and the indicators are backward. Meaning when I plug the controller into the rear charger the front light is what is used to indicate whether it's charging or not. But on the bright side, it seems to be charging the controller. I only have one at the moment so I can't really speak to its ability to charge both at the same time yet. I like that it charges through the bottom usb port instead of the top. Other charging stations have you setting the controller on upside down which looks really stupid. So if the product was actually what the pics and description show I would be very happy with it. But getting something different than what you expected is a little disappointing. Update: I had them replace the item thinking maybe it was just the I got. Plus one of the chargers stoped working. But when I got the new one it was the same as the first one. Charging indicators are backwards and it just looks different than the picture. I’ll add a picture of the front controller charging.

  Wanted something better than PITA micro-B cables jammed in at the weird angle and spot Sony opted to put the port and this fits the bill. Small footprint and easy to place your controllers in to charge. What a great thing to have.Also handy to diagnose charging issues if you've already happened to fry your controller(s) by using a high amp/volt charger as used by a lot of phones- which I did and this can sometimes let you get by if your battery is still good, but the USB board or cable are bad in your controller.

  UPDATE:Stopped working just shortly after return window closed.******A major flaw of the PS4 controller is the micro USB charge port rather than a conductive system.  Most/all charge cradles have the same problem. How do you line up the port and the plug easily?  With this design the controllers fit in perfectly and charger from the headphone port. Not sure if that is efficient but it works. A major flaw with this charging cradle is it does not feel sturdy and does feel like cheap plastic.

",5.0,Michael Robert Plichta,"Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  Bluetooth syncing PS4 controllers with a PC is a multi-step process that my family members loath to do.  The PS4 will not charge the controllers until they are resynced with it so we waste a full minute for it to wake and sync each day.  Then we have to resync them with PC the next time we play.  This device eliminates this issue and we spend much, much less time messing with controller setup or dealing with low batteries.It is still important for PS4 only usage due to the port on the PS4 controller being angled downwards. This is designed for comfort while playing, but it makes it so undue pressure is put upon the port when they charge on a table.  This device allows them to charge snuggly without damaging the charge port.  I love the immediate gratification of the light color change when you plug it in.  There is usually a 5+ second wait after connecting to PS4 with traditional cable before you see the glowing yellow charge light.

  Why I got it:I needed a standalone stand to charge my PS4 controllers instead of using a USB and having the controllers just on top of tables or whatever. I only have two controllers, so this was perfect.Why I like it:This may not be a reason for everyone, but one reason I went this route was because I wanted it to match the stand I have for my XBOX One. Since they both are onto of my TV console, I didn't want a bunch of different charging stands, so it looks great (the XBOX One is not this same brand). It seems to work fine for the most part and charges just fine. I like the LED in the front, though I'm not sure of it's purpose, reason explained in next section.Why I don't like it:It has two LED indicators for your controllers in the front, but besides being there for looks it really hasn't served any purpose. It was on all the time for me, whether the controller was plugged in or not. And there's no change in color indicating the controller's were fully charged or not. Also, they don't include a outlet plug. They give you a standard micro-usb cable, but unless you have a bunch of spare USB Outlet plugs or other means, you'll need to supply your own.Summary:Status: ReturnedIn the end, I wanted something that would indicate when the controller was charged or at least let me know that was plugged in properly. And having to use my own USB plug was a little lame in my opinion. In the end, the price wasn't band, it seemed like it got the job done, but wanted a little more.

  I bought this for my DualShock 4 controllers that are connected via Bluetooth to my Steam PC rig. For some reason, I have inconsistent results when attempting to charge them via microUSB cable, so I found I was having to keep them connected to a cable in order to use them. That is, until I found this handy charging station! Controllers can now charge in a reasonable amount of time (I'm usually never in a hurry and tend to rotate controllers). No more empty batteries!

  Gone are the days of waiting hours for my controller to charge. Gone are the days of having to plug it into the PlayStation while I play. This gem charges quicker than any charger for any device I have ever seen. I love that I can spend all day playing with one of the kids and then charge both at the same time. When it first came I had a really hard time getting it lined up correctly, but I eventually got the hang of it - I can be taught - and now it locks in place without a problem. The only bummer I have encountered is that the two controllers with rubber covers cannot fit. Thank goodness the kids use those and sit in the chair right next to it so it can plug into the ps4, while I use the others, lol.

That was on 6/9/20 and I haven’t heard from them since. Customer service doesn’t seem to be their strongest suit.

  Got this as a gift for my bf. He was skeptical at first but it grew on him. He comments frequently now about how handy it is. Much easier and less finicky than using a cord, has a small profile, and it’s nice to charge 2 controllers simultaneously. Had it for several months now with daily use and no problems. Can’t beat the price.

  I bought two of these for my four controllers.They've worked great for about 6 months then one of them started going bad.One still works perfectly so it's not all bad. The indicator lights never seemed to work well either.I expected it to be red when low and green when charged.However; when I plug in a low controller, it turns red for about 10 seconds then green so you can't tell if the controller is low or charged.If I had to do it over again, I would not purchase this item and spend a few bucks more for something of better quality.

  This is a great charger -- Main thing to know about it is probably that seating your controller on there is smooth and easy.  I've had ones that were a bit fiddly in the past with the connectors, but this one works perfectly and the controllers are guided by the design right to their target.  Excellent.  I need to check if they make something similar for my Move Controllers, now!  :D

  I purchased this for a friend for Christmas gift. It works great the only thing I wish is that it came with an AC adapter. I was able to find one easily on Amazon and it wasn't expensive.. it just would have been nice if I hadn't had to do that given the Holiday Rush.

  Great product so far and works as described.I had a nyko controller charger before this that used both usb ports on the ps4 and only had usb 2.0 pass through ports.  So I had to stop using it when I added an external hard drive for games.So I bought this to help keep a controller charged all the time.Pros:Charges using the bottom port on the controller, which seems more durable than the micro usb.Does not require a dongle to be left in the micro usb port, so can still easily charge with a cable if needed.It is small and can be placed anywhere convenient, such as an end table next to my recliner.Placing controllers on the charger is simple and it is designed to help align the controller into place.Indicator lights on the front that turn green when charged and red when charging.Cons:Takes 2 hands to remove the controller because you have to hold the charger down, while lifting the controller.

  This charger is absolutely great.  I had held off on one of these forever because I always just plug the controller into the cord coming from the system while playing.  Won't get a dead battery that way.  But, recently I've been taking notice of how I dislike always having gaming cords on the floor, or, having to remember to unhook them and put them away every time I finished playing.  This is a cheap charger.  It isnt particularly fast, but since I have a 2nd controller, even if the one I'm using runs out of juice I have no worries.  It's been nicer than I realized to not have to deal with always plugging in the charging cord when I want to play video games, so I most definitely recommend this.

  I don't used them so I don't really know much.  However, I helped my sons put their controller to charge once a while and seems to work okay.  Sometimes, looks like its done charge because of showing green light but once touch, the light turn red again (which means need charge).  I guess the port aren't tight enough so might be loosing.

  I recommend this product, since it meets its objective, it is also easy to use, it is elegant, and you will not have to hair every time you try to insert or remove the controls as with other products that if they are cumbersome, the only thing I did not like This product is that it does not bring to connect it directly to the current; just bring the USB cable

  Easy to use. Amazing.  I love how it has the red or green to let you know how the controllers are charging. The controls attach to the deck easily and they come off just as easy.  Not only does it charge the PS brand control but it also chargers the knock off version of the controller. This charger is so much better than the PS4 Charging deck.  I will be purchasing another one.  Downside it doesn't come with the USB to hook up to an out lit.
