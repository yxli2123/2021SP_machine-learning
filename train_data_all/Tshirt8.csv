  I ordered two t-shirts, different colors. They’re beefy, not the thin fabric. The grey one was slightly large, I wear XL/ Tall, which is perfect. The chocolate colored one was identical but just fit. It’s actually a little tight. But, they’re 100% cotton. An undersight on my part, I should have gone with 2XL to allow for shrinkage.

  I normally wear a women's small or medium t-shirt. I wanted something to wear around the house that fits over my Lands End sport knit pants and capris. These Men's Beefy medium t-shirts (I bought five different colors) had fit nicely and were a bit loose before I washed them. I used cold water and low dryer temp. After washing and drying, the shirts all shrank at least an inch all over and now the chest/shoulder area is tight and the butt area is tighter. Also the bottom seam flips up and won't stay flat. I guess they are ok for the price. The cotton is not soft and is slightly scratchy. Two shirts arrived with tags, the others were tagless. I'll probably have to wear them with regular shorts and tucked in rather than worn as overshirts. I'd size up next time.

  I bought this shirt as a test shirt to see how it fit and how thick it was.This shirt has become my go-to work shirt. I work in the medical field and in a cold environment often. My PPE keeps the bad stuff off me and these insulate me from the PPE. They're nice and thick compared to most shirts and the cost is low enough that if I tear it's cheap enough to throw away and buy another.I've found them thicker but at about 3x the cost these are far superior. The best part about finding these work shirts is they're so comfy and soft I can wear them on my off days and still get told how soft they are.Buy one and watch how fast you reorder a bunch more. I dare you.

",5.0,Gary Reynolds,"Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2018","









  
  
    
  I had an XL before because I wear that in other shirts, but it was way too small.  Ordered a 2XL this time and it’s perfect after washing it.  Was a bit too long, but the length reduced a bit after washing.I usually buy Soffe t-shirts because they are a good, heavyweight t-shirt, but their black ones tend to fade to dark gray over several months.  The Hanes beefy t’s seem to stay darker longer without fading.  I’ve also noticed the knot collar on the Soffes becomes frayed after a few months, but my Hanes beefy t’s collars don’t do that, even after many years.

  The quality of the shirt was perfect. It is just the same as the Beefy-t shirts I bought decades ago. Very thick material and solidly constructed. I normally wear an XL to 2XL. I bought a 2XL and immediately washed and dried it on hot settings to get any shrinking done that was going to happen. It fit fine after washing and drying. I am glad I bought 2XL rather than XL as I think the smaller size would have been tighter than I like it.

  Great shirts, great color and great feel. Do not like the fact that they aren’t as long as expected. I’ve got some big and tall shirts from JCpenny before and those shirts are long enough to reach about the groin area. These beefy shirts sit just on the belt and a bit above it, not long enough in my opinion but they are comfortable. If your job requires the shirt to be tucked in and your doing movements just be prepared to be tucking your shirt in all day.

  Well, they have done it.  They have perfected shrinking technology, and focused it all in to this one product.  I bought these as undershirts, and as such, they need to be tucked in to my pants.  First wear, they fit fine, I'm happy with the shirt.  After the first wash, they have shrunk at least two sizes.  They no longer can be tucked in.  I have never seen shirts that shrink so much.  They will be getting thrown away.  If you want shirts that start out normal, then transform into halter tops, then buy these.  If you want shirts that stay the same size as when you bought them, then DON'T BUY THIS SHIRT.

I’m a woman and after buying this for my husband I wanted one to sleep and lounge in. I bought a medium and it was so tight around my hips I couldn’t stand it! These do shrink about a half size also after washing in cold water and dried on low. I then tried a large but still to tight on hips! So bottom line great tee for guys (they don’t have hips like woman) or slender girls. I recommend sizing up for sure!

    Junk.  Shrinks 2 or more sizes on first wash
  
",1.0,Tom Barrister,"Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  Hanes was once a dependable manufacturer.  They must have outsourced their factories.  In any case, now I understand why Fruit of the Loom has taken so much business away from them.  I can wear a size 3x without it being overly tight.  I ordered 4x to sleep in, because I like the extra room.I always wash and dry the shirts before wearing, to get rid of the chemical smell.  When I tried them on afterwards, they were very tight, as a size L or 2XL would be.  They shrank at least 2 sizes.  they also still had that chemical dye smell typical of outsourced clothing.  I cannot recommend this product.

I love the extra length in a tall shirt but the 2XL part is just not beefy enough for me and feels some what tight.

  The fabric is soft, relatively thick, and very comfortable. There is none of the itchiness or stiffness that often characterizes heavily dyed material. The composition is 100% cotton but feels stretchy as if it contained spandex. The shirt size is a large but feels a little tight. I am 5' 8"", chest size 43"", and weigh about 200 lbs. The collar, in particular, is a tad small. But this is still an excellent shirt for the price. Glad there are no seams along the sides.

  I purchased this shirt in black for my boyfriend to wear to work. He normally wears 2x in hanes but feels like they're a bit snug near his waist/stomach cause he has a little beer belly. So I bought him the beefy tee thinking it would still fit him well everywhere else while giving him a little extra room so it wasn't too fitting on his stomach. This shirt isn't any less snug which is disappointing cause going up to 3x looks pretty baggy on him. The shirt itself isn't bad but it certainly didn't meet expectations so I feel it doesn't deserve more than 3 stars.

  I bought this shirt to be a gift for a friend fully intending to embellish it requiring hand stitching. Given it’s 100% cotton I thought best to wash and dry it first to get initial shrinkage out of the way. After doing so in a small cold water load with other dark tees, the Hanes shirt came out of the dryer with a portion of the hem undone. In requesting to get it exchanged I was told it may take two days to get a reply. When no reply came I called the number on the third-party invoice. Their outgoing message said leave a message and we’ll reply within three days. Sheesh! I then saw the fine print that said it’s not returnable if washed. So I guess I’m repairing the hem by hand.

  These t-shirts are a nice thick cotton but still very breathable. The sizing on the shirt was exactly as expected. My husband is 5'8 and weighs roughly 180 pounds. He doesn't like tight fitting shirts and he normally wears a size large. The large size in this shirt fits him perfectly and even has a little more length to it than most shirts we find which we loved because my husband has a slightly longer torso and hates when his shirts ride up when he's working on things, so having that extra inch or so in length makes all the difference!The shirt also offers exceptional color options. We purchased the navy blue color and it is very vibrant in person. The shirt itself looks exceptionally well made and durable. This shirt is truly a great work shirt that you can wear all year round for a multitude of occassions. Again, they are a nice thick cotton and not a thin shirt and is so insanely comfortable. We've washed it a few times now and it's held up beautifully and hardly shrank if at all! Definitely a quality t shirt at an amazing price. My husband is very happy with it and we would definitely recommend it.***Update: These shirts would also be amazing for custom t-shirts, Cricut creations or other iron-on vinyl projects too! 😍.

  Junk!  These used to be like G.I. issue shirts long ago.  Now they include stretched out neck bands which get larger when washed!  I'm sorry I bought them, typical Asia made shirts with poor quality.  Seams were not uniform as well.  I've heard that the Costco shirts may be better.  Amazon did have a good price on these shirts, but I'm sorry that I purchased them.

  The material that this shirt is made of is a heavy weight, good quality material. The stitching is OK for the most part but did have one area where the threads are beginning to unravel after only a couple of washes. It isn't bad, but it shouldn't be unraveling at all. The shirt I ordered was a larger size than needed and it is a good thing since these shirts seem to run a bit smaller than expected. Again, not too bad, but definitely can notice the difference in the fit. It did shrink a little but not enough to worry about if you ordered a size larger to start with it should still fit. I'm satisfied with the style and quality but would order a size larger than what you normally wear.

  Fair warning! The shirt and sleeves are exactly as expected, nice and roomy, but the neck is apparently one-size-fits-all. And that size is  infant 1- 3 mos. LOL. Perfect for humans with disproportionately tiny heads and necks and giant bodies, aka Mr. Robotnik. Would not purchase again. Three stars because these are lounge shirts that will not be worn in public (aka aggressively stretching the neck to fit) so serviceable. Not recommended, though.

I'm sure it looks sloppy on me but I love my clothes to be very, very loose and when you are as big as I am, that's not easy to find. The fabric is soft and thick and the seams are good quality. I have washed and dried it several times and there has been no shrinkage. You can't even find a shirt in this size at a thrift store but if you did I'm sure it would cost more then the $5 this one cost. I have ordered 2 more even though I am steadily losing weight, this is a deal I couldn't pass up.

  . . . bought a medium, and it's way too small. Bought a large, and it fits the way a medium should. Some of these ""Beefy Tees"" are tagless, but some aren't. Luck of the draw. Finally, they're not really beefy anymore. They're normal. If you buy a regular t-shirt these days, it's probably going to be very thin and flimsy, so you have to get one of these just to get decent material. If you're looking for something extra thick though (beefy), you'll have to keep looking. Overall, a decent plain t-shirt for around 6 or 7 bucks.

  My poor pup got into an accident with a car and got a nice hematoma on his shoulder well had to get tubes put in and all that well he doesn't care about shirts being put on him these were $3 so i was willing to buy a few so I used it to absorb the leakage and cover it because it was hard to look at.  the shirt stayed to form did not stretch at the collar which was nice and if you are sweaty this shirt is a nice because it does good with absorption but not soaking the shirt and he wore these all day and the fluid never soaked through the shirt and there was a constant flow of liquid and the feel was nice and did not irritate this skin or fur over all i think these are good shirts i use these for my tie dye and i love them as well.

  Suprisingly good fabric and it fit well for the cost at $4.89 a pop which was a steal at my size (6xl). The stiching is terrible and slap-dash. The collar tabs had be snipped of as they are very uncomfortable. They really should use print-on labeling.

  I typically like to wear T-shirts that are either obnoxious or controversial, but I really do need some that don't really have any print. There's a time and place after all. This shirt is perfect. It has the loose fit that I prefer, without being a tent. The material and feel is great. My wife actually really likes it on me (she hates my obnoxious T-shirts...everyone's a critic).

",1.0,DisclosureImminent,"Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2018","









  
  
    
  A few months ago I ordered a sample of these tshirts. They fit perfect and were nice and beefy. However after I reordered this time with the same seller, these tshirts were not the same. They were a lot thinner material and they did not have the tagless style. It seems like Hanes sold out just like the Rast of the t-shirt companies and opted for cheaper thin stretchy material. Very disappointing, since this was the last resort for thicker tshirts. They'll say it was the same thickness bit standards have definitely changed. I have the comparisons right here In front of me. I hate wasting money buying cloths online when they keep getting cheaper with quality.

Don't buy and expect what you had in years past is my warning.

  I got a white tee in XL size and it turned out to be too big. However, the fabric felt heavy and better than those super thin T-shirts that everybody else offers. So I ordered one in L size but in a different color. Well, this time the tee is a little too small. Also, the fabric is nowhere as heavy as the tee I received earlier.I suspect that Hanes has good intentions to offer a slightly better product but these are still mass produced in low wage factories. There seems to be inconsistency in quality and sizing. You may get lucky or you may not.Lastly, I recommend sticking to whites and lighter shades as the quality of dye in darker tees seems rather poor and will fade rapidly.

  Disclaimer; I'm a weightlifter so my body proportions are a little abnormal. I usually buy old navy t-shirts and I really like the way they fit/feel.

Just not thin to the point it'll wear or rip faster. Id buy a size larger than you like because it will shrink when you wash. I bought 4x and washed it once and it now fits like a 3x.

  Comfortable and soft, particularly suitable for wearing as an underlayer (which is how I use it).  I found that it shrank just enough in the wash to make it a bit more snug than I'd expected, especially in the shoulders and underarm.  I tend to wear a medium size in a shirt, and have to choose between M & L in tshirts, depending on how they're made. Using this as an undershirt (under a dress shirt) works well enough for my needs.  I'd probably get the large size if I were looking for a white tshirt to wear by itself.

At the same time, I like my shirts to be soft and feel little like a blanket, a soft blanket that will keep me warm in the winter and wick my sweat in the summer when I'm hot.

  I wear t-shirts almost daily.  You can pay an awful lot for one, or buy really cheap ones that are pretty thin, lose their shape and don't last long, or you can buy these.  They are good quality, great price for what you get and hold shape and color for quite a while.  Different colors too, which I like.  Highly recommended.

    Hane's Men's Short Sleeve Beefy-T, Deep Red shirt (perfect fit - no extra room.

  Hane's Men's Short Sleeve Beefy-T, Deep Red:  I bought this in large for my husband who is a toothpick and thought it a bit smaller through the middle than other Large. So keep this in mind. It seems to be a very nice material and not as thick and heavy as some other brands. It is not so thin that you can see through it in light either. So it is a nice shirt for the money in every way. He liked it.

  A lot thicker than expected. I’m usually a large but it was a little snug and I like looser shirts. Glad I got both a LG and XL. The XL is a much more comfortable fit. I’d suggest going up a size.

  The only issue I have with these shirts is the amount of fuzz left on my skin even after initial washing before wearing. I have really sensitive skin and I itch quite a lot while wearing them. Cortisone cream helps tho.If your skin isn't as prone then you will probably not have this issue.Overall fit is ok. Didn't shrink even after drying on the hottest setting.

  I'd been buying Hanes mens's shirts for ages and these just don't measure up. The seams show a bit of fraying and I have only just gotten them out of the bag. The back neck and shoulder are anti chafing and well stitched but the front neck and the rest of them look sloppy and are not stitched the same. The sizing has changed as these are snug even before washing. The older 4X all fit loose and a lil baggie same as when I bought them. I've lost weight so it's not that.

  This t-shirt is shaped really weird.  When you pull up your arms feels like bat wings.  I can't imagine this fitting a larger person properly.  Somebody cut it out wrong or something.  I bought it larger and I'm a woman but I also have other large man-sized shirts to wear around the house and this one is shaped really weird.  The material is a little thicker than the thin material they've been making t-shirts out of lately but you can still see light through one layer.

  I go through tees rather quickly as I wear them for work, and I end up buying 5 or 6 new shirts at once every 4 months. My usual choice (Fruit Of The Loom) went up significantly in price, so I thought I'd try these out. They smelled terrible straight from the packaging,  but I tried one on anyway and it fit perfectly. I washed the whole batch once and they've all shrunk from 4xl down to 3xl... I'm very disappointed, and I won't be buying more of them, no matter how cheap they are.

  I really like these tshirts.  I've probably 20 of them in various colors and duplications.  I'm a bit portly (or, as my doctor says,  morbidly obese). These shirts are long enough to get over the belly and properly tucked in. The stay tucked, there is no plumbers crack (and at plus 300 lbs, others appreciate it not rearing its ugly rear) to show off.These shirts are even better than the Penny's Towncraft Tees from the 1960's.  Last for years and hold their shape.

  Ordering an XL, it came and was shorter and smaller than an XL that you would read here on Amazon as 'fits just right'. After one wash, shrinks too much to wear. Additionally, I'm wondering if those rating this as ""super soft and comfy"" are getting a different product, because my order is a heavier cotton, more like a work shirt. Don't waste your money; spend a little extra and get something decent.

  This is normally a great shirt but a dishonest seller sent me a counterfeit shirt!  I have ordered many of these shirts in the past in many colors and they are all the same high quality with a screen printed label on the inside. I ordered 2 black shirts that came from the same seller and I was sent rubbish. The cotton is thin and the sewn in label is terrible also the shirts smell bad. Amazon is replacing them. If your a first time buyer just make sure your getting the real thing.Edit:So after more research I looks like Hanes changed the product....and I'll never by another.

  This is NOT 6xl by any means even if the tag says it. I wear 4xl and this shirt was way to I'll fitting and tight. I've washed it tried stretching it. I ended up having to cut it because I needed a black shirt for the kids tie dye project I had to put slits in the waist  on each side and had to slit the arms up as well as the neck. This was the MOST  awkward fitting shirt I have ever run across.

  Sorry to have to write a negative review, but these are billed as 100% cotton.  When I received my order of 2 of them (charcoal/heather) they are labeled 60% cotton / 40% polyester.  I really don't like anything but 100% cotton so they are being returned.  I seem to see that frequently shirts in the gray colors are cotton/poly blend and avoid those but there was no indication in the description or reviews that this was the case with these.  The shipping was quick and product arrived in fine condition, too bad they aren't really full cotton - my search continues...

    Too beefy
  
",2.0,DJ,"Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this shirt for my husband for a family picture. Just needed a white tee shirt that fit him. All the ones instore are to tight, and fit like undershirts. The title beefy made me buy this shirt hoping it would be loose fitting and roomy, well this shirt could have been a night gown for him. This shirt was so oversized it was funny. I suggest ordering a size down at least. Maybe even 2 sizes down. Otherwise it had great material. Very thick. It’s a nice white shirt but it was beyond “beefy” than we were looking for.

    Not the best sleeping shirt for women.
  
",3.0,Mujituji,"Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  I am a 5'7 160lb woman who ordered these shirts in 4XL to be worn to bed. The first thing I noticed was the pungent odor (think bbq sauce), but I understand that they may just need to be washed a couple of times first. The second thing I noticed was how rough and stiff these shirts are. They do not feel soft against my skin, which is what I seek in sleeping shirts. Maybe that will also change after a couple of washes. Straight out of the box I can't say that I love these shirts, but they aren't that bad. I bought them at $4/shirt so it was a good deal I would say, but I definitely would never pay full price for these.

  Previously bought JC Penney Stafford white t-shirts for years and years, but they were getting lighter in weight and heavier in price each time I bought them, so it was finally time to choose a different supplier. These beefy-Ts seem to be the best value in 100% cotton t-shirts.One note: Other reviews reported that sometimes these shirts are tagless and sometimes have a black tag (as mentioned in the description). I've placed two orders so far - the first came with a double black tag and the second came with a white tag. The second order did not have ""BeefyT"" printed anywhere on the tag, but the product number (05180) on the plastic was correct, and the shirts from the second order matched the shirts from the first order.

  I'm having doubts if these shirts are actually made by HANES, ordered a large and medium to check fit and the tags are diferent on both and look different than the ones I buy from the store, also they seem to be of a lighter material than the beefy shirts I'm used to buying. I wear a size medium and it fits fitted. Tried the large after washing and drying and fits just right.Definitely go one size bigger.: UPDATE: So after one wash the black tee is way lighter in color, how disappointing, Hanes Beefy tees used be of much better quality, also why put 2 tags when before they used to be tagless?Hanes you need to go back to quality instead of cutting back to save on costs.

    Order One Size Up
  
",3.0,Empty Nester,"Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2018","









  
  
    
  I ordered a medium, which according to Haynes is for chests 38-40. My chest is exactly 40. When I tried the shirt on it was skin tight; so tight that I actually had some problems peeling it off. I then measured the shirt front just below the armpits and it was 19"" wide; times two is 38"". This explains why it was so tight for a 40 chest. As far as ""beefy"" was concerned, my opinion is that it's not. It's not thin, but neither is it heavy. Hanes used to sell a true ""beefy"" T, which I wore for probably 10 years, but a few years ago they cheapened the product.I had also been considering buying similar shirts from LL Bean or Land's End, but those cost 3 times as much; around $18 each, I decided to return the Hanes shirts and see what the much higher price of a LL Bean shirt would get me. When the shirts arrived I did some comparisons. The LL Bean shirt chest front measured 22"" (compared to 19"" for the Hanes) and it weighed 7.6  oz compared to 6.5 oz for the Haines; i.e. the LL Bean shirt was beefier than the Hanes, even though it was described as standard weight.Is it worth 3 times the price? Probably not. Just order one size up, don't expect a heavy weight shirt, and you'll probably be happy and definitely richer.

  Where'd the quality go? Stitching in the underarms started to become undone with one use.  Bought them for my roommate as a gift. Definitely not the Hanes Beefy T-shirt quality we're used too. Also, as far as comfort, these have tags which most shirts now a days don't have. My main issue is it shouldn't fall apart after wearing it once. I bought 2 and both did it.
