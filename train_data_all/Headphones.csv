    Questionable comfort
  
",3.0,Garry Davis,"Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  These headphones were described as a ""professional level product"" but clearly miss the mark when it comes to comfort in particular. Wearing these headphones for long periods of time is not recommended as they seem to not fit over the ear well and create a lot of head pressure. The sound quality is not as high as some other manufactures products as well but not the worst either. I would probably give them an ""average"" rating.

    Nice, but uncomfortable with piercings.
  
",4.0,Nith,"Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2019","









  
  
    
  I just used them for about 2 hours and it started to become pretty unpleasant on the ear I have a cartilage piercing on, but that isn't going to be of importance to most people. I'll still probably put up with it and I should take breaks anyway. These will stay in the studio, they're not for everyday use for me. They sound great if you just want to listen to music on the go, but honestly, I think there are better, more comfortable, and more portable options. If you want a pair in this price range for your home studio though, strongly recommend.

    Subpar product with worse Amazon customer service
  
",1.0,Joel,"Reviewed in the United States April 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  Decently comfortable headphones.  Actually impressed with the audio quality, both wired and using bluetooth.  The undisclosed issue is with the microphone and using the headphones for bluetooth calls.  Numerous phone call recipients noted the headset produces audio so poorly, it's essentially inaudible.  I had a hard time believing this was the case and attempted to continue to use the headset with more phone calls, only to receive the same feedback.  I eventually emailed the manufacturer and received this message:Thank you for contacting Audio-Technica U.S., Inc.  Yes unfortunately the echo you describe when using them for phone calls is as designed on this model.  It appears to be a limitation of the microphone built into the earcup of the headphone.  Unfortunately we do not have any remedies for this at this time. We apologize for the inconvenience.I received this information after Amazon's return window was up and now Amazon refuses to do anything about selling a known faulty product.  Amazon's customer service included helpful tips like ""have you tried resetting the device?"" and ""did you purchase insurance"" and then dropped the chat conversation within 10 seconds.  An overall very unfortunate experience.You've been forewarned.

    Good Balance in Sound
  
",5.0,Jimmy,"Reviewed in the United States May 12, 2018","









  
  
    
  It's been a few months, and all I can say is wow! These headphones have a great durable design and they fit nice and snug around your ears (with and without a hat on). The Gun Metal edition comes with a carrying case, a 3ft coil cable (strecthes to 9ft), and 3ft straight cable. After listening to these headphones, I've realized that these headphones focus on providing crisp and clean sound for high and mid frequencies. The lows are audible, but not very loud, resulting in a balanced listening experience. Often I will hear little details in the music and vocals better in these headphones instead of my more bass-heavy in-ear headphones. Overall I recommend this product to anybody that is trying to hear the full spectrum of any song better. I would argue, as does everyone else, that these are the best headphones for the price, by far.

    This is my second pair, so obviously I like them

  There are many other reviews you can read that go into greater detail about all the specs on these things, but this is not one of those reviews.I have a set for home (my old plain ATH-M50 which I have had for 2 years) and a set for work (this pair, the ATH-M50x). I can't really tell the difference (if any) in sound quality as the speakers are pretty much identical. I bought the M50x pair for work and wear them about 6-7 hours a day. I have a rather fat head but these are still incredibly comfortable after hours of wear.I have several points I like to make about these headphones:1 - These sound good (like really good, with all types of audio AND that sound quality does NOT seem to fade over time)2 - These headphones are very comfortable (however, you do need to wear them for a little while so that they form to your head)3 - While these are very comfortable, if your head/ears perspire (sweat), you should remove them every so often so that your ears do not become a swamp (the plastic/leather cups tend to form a rather good seal around your ears)Bottom line: I would wear these all the time if I did not have to interact with people every so often. The quality you get for the price (keep an eye on the sales too) is totally worth it.2 year edit:After 2 years of using these almost every day at my desk, they are still going strong. The white pair did have a little bit of flaking on the top of the head band, but it is purely cosmetic, and even then, very minor.I also use my older black pair when I travel, and they still sound the same, 4 years later.Only complaint I have is that your ears can get a little sweaty if you wear these for too long, but that still rarely happens.If you are on the fence, buy these, you will not regret it. (But keep in mind, these are not noise cancelling and they are not some hyped up high bass speakers on a band. They are mid-level, balanced, durable, and all around great sounding multipurpose headphones)

    Great headphones ESPECIALLY when paired with an amplifier!
  
",5.0,SunDevil03,"Reviewed in the United States June 10, 2016","









  
  
    
  I'm loving the ATH-M50x headphones. I really wanted some good quality headphones to enjoy great music on the go and these do not disappoint. Really excellent crystal clear highs. The bass response on their own isn't that great, but when paired with a FiiO A3 headphone amplifier these headphones become the total package.No, these are not Beats headphones and they aren't for bass junkies. (Not that anything is wrong with that. We all have different tastes.) But just be aware these headphones are not going to make you feel like you're inside a subwoofer. The bass is very responsive and snappy. I find it gets a tad muddy at higher volumes but those are MUCH higher volumes.I personally enjoy using the bass boost on my A3 when I listen to rock music with these headphones, and I turn it off when I listen to acoustic or instrumental stuff. These two devices are a match made in heaven.

  I don't write reviews often but this one was a bummer for me. I know AT is a good brand so I was excited for this upgrade. At first everything worked well. I BT connected to my phone and played music no problem, and same with my laptop. I then tried to talk on discord while listening to music and the headphones would only play one program at a time. While trying to troubleshoot I ended up spending an hour completely unable to connect because the device showed up as 2 separate things in the BT menu. Being unsure what was what I ended up going in circles until I was finally able to play the correct program to the correct BT item to get it to work again. When I was on discord I was told my voice quality was muffled and bad. When I was listening to music it sounded awful 50% of the time for no apparent reason. A range of issues from tinny, to flat to a distorted wave effect. I tried to use the aux cable at multiple points to just use it as a regular wired headset, but my laptop wouldn't even recognize they were plugged in. I checked on another computer and had the same problem. Over all I only had them 3 days but I spent enough time fiddling and googling to realize these weren't salvageable. Returned them and ordered the Bose 700s, hopefully I'll have better luck with those

    Great sound and battery. But didnt make the cut for me
  
",3.0,CaliGirl,"Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  Sound quality is fantastic just like the ATH-M50x (possibly better). I have been using that pair for the last two years on commute and in studio. I tested and returned the BT after two days of use. Reasons were not sound, battery or comfort related, but realted to Multi device support and the mic call quality. For me I need a headset that can switch between laptop and phone seamlessly. You need to disconnect and reconnect the M50-BT. I had reports of bad mic quality on my test calls from mulitple people with full service etc. So they didn't pass the initiation.  I will get the Sony's next.

    Love them! But that whole ""flat sound signature"" thing is just a lie.
  
",4.0,Luis Martinez,"Reviewed in the United States March 6, 2017","









  
  
    
  After one year and two months of owning these, having them broken in and having myself accustomed to them, I must say, these are one hell of a bang for your buck. They're not perfect, let's start by clarifying that, the soundstage is weaksauce and there's a peak in the treble that really makes the S sound pop out (to which my ears are sensitive, so I can't crank them up that extra 10% volume to reach my sweet spot, but I blast them just under and they're perfectly good there). The padding in the headband is adequate at best. Defects out of the way, time for the worship.SOUNDThe clarity in these is INSANE and IN-YOUR-FACE, I'd consider them sort of aggressive actually (which I love, but if you like something more mellow you may try going for something like Bose). The bass is SOLID and smoooooooth~ really nice, no distortion whatsoever at any volume I've listened to it in (and I've gone LOUD, deafeningly loud, so if it distorts after that and that's a problem for you, man, your ears must be serious beasts to be able to bear that!). The mids are present, just present, they don't pop out, they're not absent, they're just there, loud and clear. The treble is pretty shiny, on the higher end of things some sounds may come across as a bit metallic though, but nothing particularly bad. The treble side of things does pop out a bit more, but it's just bright enough for you to listen to it crystal clear while being mellow enough for your ears to not hurt. At really high volumes there's the S issue though, as I previously mentioned. You can easily fix that with an EQ, and that's the single peak that has given me any issues at all, the rest of the sounds coming out of these are AMAZING.BUILD AND COMFORTWhat can I say? I've had them for a year and two months now. I've accidentally dropped them from my desk to the hard, carpetless floor, I've been a jackass to them and never put them in their carrying pouch, as in, NEVER, I just carry them on my neck if I head out to a situation where they may come in handy. I haven't been the most careful of owners, and yet, they're as good as new. No scratches, no loosened parts, no cracks, NOTHING. These are SOLID. If you were to choose one last pair of headphones and head out to Narnia where you won't be buying any new ones any time soon, these would be the ones. What's more, I recently looked for someone who dismantled them online, or straight up broken them, to have a better look at their insides and I was pleasantly surprised by the fact that the ENTIRE HEADBAND is made out of METAL.  As for comfort, they're right there in terms of weight. They're not heavy, they're not particularly lightweight, just light enough to wear them just fine, heavy enough to have a presence on your head. If you have middle sized ears, they will fit just fine within the earpads, no issues, they're comfortable and firm. Your ears will barely if ever touch the drivers, The headband's padding is adequate at best, it could be better. In my experience, they do get tiring for the top of my head after a couple of hours, but nothing a short break can't fix, and I do wear these most of the day.I've bought more headphones within the time I bought these and now, but I always keep coming back to these sooner or later, and that's gotta say something. They've proven themselves to be potentially underpriced and I definitely recommend them.PSA: If the earpads are not good for you, I suggest you be careful when choosing others because the stock pads have this cushiony thick fabric at the drivers that adds a bit of a THUMP to the bass and kills the harsher side of the treble, so the sound WILL change with other earpads if you don't choose carefully. They will sound UNBEARABLY HARSH so choose wisely, the thicker cushiony fabric at the drivers is necessary for these to sound right.

    Bought to use with Roku
  
",5.0,Richard Ashwood,"Reviewed in the United States May 13, 2018","









  
  
    
  I bought this headset to use with my Roku remote and the sound quality is great.  About me  I have a xxxl large head wearing almost a size 8.  I guess my ears sit lower than the norm since the ear pieces in my motorcycle helmet are above my actual ears.  The head set fits just fine and could have handled my head even if had been a little  larger.  I read somewhere that the head set eats the batteries on the roku, still not sure about that.  I also read that if you leave the roku plugged into any headset, while not it in use, will drain the battery.  So to counter that I unplug the headset after use which seems to work.  I also  use rechargeable batteries for the roku.

    AWESOME SOUND AND PRICE
  
",5.0,John G,"Reviewed in the United States July 8, 2018","









  
  
    
  Sound is amazingly clean and clear with no perceptable distortion.  The bass seems a little stronger than I expected, but it is solid and tight, also without any noticeable distortion.  I have fallen asleep with them on and also listened to them for hours with very decent comfort.  Sometimes I have to readjust the headband if listening awhile and I'm laying down, but the earpieces stay sealed around my ears very well.  They block out almost all other noise, without needing noise cancelling.  I highly recommend them, especially for the price.

    Great quality sound, okish quality build, no so great comfort
  
",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States July 23, 2017","









  
  
    
  I have these for almost a year and they have been great. I upgraded from crappy Apple ear buds. The quality of the sound was very impressive. I was able to hear things in the music I couldn't hear before. I was shocked by the amount of detail I was missing in my songs video games. I have used these for 10 months every day for at least a few hours but on average probably more than 6 and even more in the summer. I wear them to block out the sound of my AC. They don't do a good job of that and admittedly they're not designed for that but my AC is 3 feet from my ears and anything helps. The pads had recently started to fall apart which is unfortunate; however, given the amount of time wear them, I'm surprised it didn't happen sooner. I'm impressed with out long they lasted given the material but I wish they would have lasted indefinitely. Now I'm off to dig fake leather from my ears. Overall, I enjoyed them.I forgot to mention comfort. These are a little tight on my head. Maybe I have a big head. They press up against my ears ever so slightly which isn't an issue immediately, but it becomes a problem after wearing them day in and day out for months on end. The tips of ears eventually got press ulcers but they built up a tolerance to them and I'm fine now. Maybe I have big ears.I would recommend these for casual listening. Not for someone who would use them for hours and hours, days and days, months and months.

",5.0,ironbadge,"Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2017","









  
  
    
  I received it yesterday. It cost twice the Sony MDR-7506, which I also own, but its quality is more than double, maybe multi-double, in terms of sound and functionality. It's worth it. Chrystal clear, well balance, little warm (that I like). Great headphones. I listen from Andrea Bocelli to Sting to Billy Joel and lots of old schools. I hear distinctive sounds.It's well worth the hundred fifty something regular, but it is on sales now, with additional discounts, so I am thinking of getting another pair, just in case. Buy it.Now I have to continue writing my paper. Yeah it's that good, and I'm so happy (I'm a hippy, but a grumpy one) I have to stop writing (yeah today, Sunday) and posting this ""impression"" (not a review, I'm not qualified). But before that, let me have one more song. Phil Collins is good.PS. The earcups block the sounds much better than the Sony's, so it's better for studio work. I like it a lot. Now this AT is for studio work, and the Sony is for casual.PS2: the jack is ""plug-and-turn"" type. Be careful. I was impatient (I did not read the manual as usual), but by the grace of God, it still sounds great.

    My 2nd pair of M50s (first was stolen), and I LOVE them still.
  
",5.0,Sunday Socks,"Reviewed in the United States June 28, 2018","









  
  
    
  I recently ordered a new pair of M50s after my old pair was stolen from my car. I had the old pair for about a year, after having M40s for about two years. The difference between the M40 and M50 is well worth the extra $30. Stronger bass, way more clarity.I use these for regular music-listening-to, as well as mixing live events.One of the reasons I love M50s (especially when compared to the Sennheiser HD280s or Sony MDR7506) is actually the fit—the Sennheisers (despite being labeled ""over ears"") are really narrow, and squish my ears (thus eliminating part of the acoustic experience), generally fit a little too tight. The Sonys are just really loose, and always feel like they're going to fall off my head. The M50s fit my ear perfectly, and perfectly encompass my whole ear so they're truly over-ear and not on-ear headphones, and they're the right amount of pressure to seal off from outside noises—but also not be uncomfortable.I plan to stay in my M50s for a long time.I can't just say I *would* order again, if need be—I *did* order them again.And I hope whoever stole my first pair gets one of those colds that just won't go away.

    Some of the Best Sound Ever for a Mid Tier Price
  
",5.0,Joe Hill,"Reviewed in the United States August 27, 2019","









  
  
    
  I’ve had a lot of brands of headphone, including from companies that rhyme with “Moes”, or “Sang and Bowleffsun”, and I loved them. But for the price, these headphones are just the cats meow. High End Quality at a mid tier price.Only complaint I have is that sometimes when you go to pair them with a PC, and later to an Apple product, it can take some finessing. The ear pads are good but the ones I have on my Hyper X Cloud (build for long stretches of gaming) are a bit more comfy, but other than that, it’s perfect. And you can always purchase after market ear pads for a reasonable price.I use mine for gaming (Discord chat), music at work, or just watching a lot of YouTube at a coffee shop. And the comfort level has always been great on my head, neck, and ears.Battery life is legit. About 30 - 36 hours after one charge is what I typically see. Oh and they lay flat to fit into my messenger bag easily.I really love these headphones. I highly recommend them.

  Got these because they are wireless and wanted to discard some old wired headphones. This headset has good sound quality and I am overall pleased with this purchase. The only thing that bothers me is that this headset does not come with a microphone of any kind. Other than having to accommodate to this, the headset sounds good and is pretty comfortable.UPDATE: PC did not fully recognize the headset initially. Disconnected the headset then reconnected to the correct BT connection, and was able to utilize this headsets internal microphone. The quality is average but definitely would recommend purchasing an external microphone for greater quality.

",5.0,Matthew,"Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2016","









  
  
    
  I wanted to finally own some really nice headphones, and so after searching around I narrowed it down to 2. This and the Sennheiser 598. Since I'd never had an open back headphone I purchased the Sennheiser 598, and I was extremely disappointed. Since I'd never had nice headphones I assumed that what I was hearing was 'good', but it just did nothing for me. Because I was so disappointed in the Sennheiser 598 I decided to purchase these because I was hopeful there was something better I could experience in my audible life, and I'm so glad I did.These headphones are amazing. Of course it's hard to explain why, but you can pick out all of the little things each musician is doing opposed to everything being blended together. It's just a great musical experience. I don't know if my Sennheisers are knock-offs or what, but there is no comparison. The audio-technica is far superior.

  I have followed reviews and tried similar products for some time, including the noise cancellation type of headsets and earbuds. and tried them in air travel and airports as well as in the office.  These do not cancel ambient noise, but the foam cushions do reduce background noise a few dB.  The headset produces excellent sound and remains comfortable over the ears for hours. The battery life has been good, easily handling seven hours of use.  No complaints.  For what it's worth, I have come to prefer the 33dB noise reduction offered by foam earplugs on flights, rather than cranking up the music or soundtrack volume to further hide the noise of infants and blaring intercom announcements on late flights.

  After seeing many of the tech YouTubers i watch daily keep putting these as one of their top headphones, i bought into the hype and bougth these. Keep in mid ive never spent more than $30 on earphones or headphones, i thought i was going to experience something amazing, and i was totally wrong, but thats not the headphones fault. The first time i put these on, and listened to the smiths, my first initial thought i was its ok, but i just spent 100+ on these headphones. After listening to some different songs the only thing i could really pin point the different sound quality over my $20 JVC headphones were that it was much clearn in the sense of the highs not getting distorted, and the songs overall were really smooth as well. Also the comfort level on these are great, the first day they were kinda uncomfortable but after that ive been using them for 4+ almost everyday.Where these really shined for me was when recording audio, i happen to have  a blue yeti mic, their was a big difference in the way i could hear myself through the mic with these headphones vs anything else ive used, in all honestly if i wouldve been able to try these on in store, i probably wouldve gotten a gaming headset, but these work fine since from time to time i work on videos and audio.

    They sound good, but are flimsy
  
",3.0,MazerR,"Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  The sound quality was pretty good across a broad frequency range.  They were maybe not the best I've ever heard, but they were pretty close to optimal and quite pleasing to listen to.  But the construction is pretty abysmal for the price point.  The ear-cups are held in position against the head by the tiniest tab of plastic held in position by other tiny tabs of plastic, all of which are prone to snapping under ordinary use.  I'm pretty resourceful so I repaired them multiple times over the time I had them, constructing sturdier pieces to hold the ear-cups in position.  This worked until the thin plastic swivel holding the ear cups also snapped, clipping the wire running through it clear off.  I'm done struggling to fix this junk.Under extremely gentle use consisting of sitting on a desk and putting them on my head calmly, these headphones lasted 5 years.  It's not months, it was years, but that's pretty short for how long a good pair of headphones should last under gentle use.  Going cheap on the material for all the stress points is a terrible design choice, Audio-Technica, and I intend to buy from another manufacturer for my next pair of headphones.

  Very very good sound. For a pair of headphones at least. I'm not an audiophile though, so I can't speak with to much authority. Bass is clear but not overpowering. I like it. The people that are complaining are probably bass heads, and these headphones are made for accurate audio reproduction, not bass heads.The headphones don't always work with third party audio cables. I learned this first hand when I got the headphones and it was kind of confusing. Use the included cable, as per the instructions.I use it practically every day, and I'll sometimes go three days without charging it, and I've yet to see it run out of battery. Rechargeable batteries actually last longer when kept charged, I'm just pointing out that these are great.The casing is light weight plastic. I think it's appropriate, aluminum is great but overrated, and high quality plastics are very underrated on account of low quality plastics. There have been times when I forgot I was wearing them.

  I have tried a few other studio grade headphones, and these by far not only sound the best, but are extremely confortable. I guess I have a rather large head, so most other headphones feel really tight and I can't wear them for more than 30 minutes or so without getting very uncomfortable. These are much better.. lighter, great padding on the ears and the over-head portion, and I can wear them for longer sessions. My pair before this was a

   but those were way to tight, heavy, and the whatever the ear cups were made of felt like they made an airtight seal around my ears and were very uncomfortable. So I'm really glad I upgraded to the ATH-M50x's after all this time.I use these mainly to record music on my computer in Ableton Live, and also to record my electric and acoustic guitars. So I listen to both electronic music and rock and these headphones work equally well for both styles.

  I love these things. The sound is phenomenal. I like the white color, but I really wanted the iron man color scheme. Someone at work has a pair, so when he wasn’t looking I swapped um for mine. Somehow he knew they weren’t his and confronted me in the bathroom. I was all like ‘fine Sherlock... you got me... congratulations... here.’ He then asked me why I brought his headphones into the bathroom. I told him that somethings are better left unanswered. He doesn’t talk to me anymore.

    Not for Women's Acappella
  
",4.0,mskm,"Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2016","









  
  
    
  I bought these headphones after reading all the wonderful reviews. And they are good--well made, have decent sound--but they don't meet my needs. My main use for these would be to listen to women's acappella music. With these headphones, I found some noises in the environment (such as page-turns by the choir) to be almost as loud as some of the singing; this may be a slight exaggeration, but you could hear the page turns--which is sort of cool, in a way, but I really want to have the voices stand out, instead. Now that I have done even more research (on headphone.com), I realize that the ATH-M50x's frequency response has a dip right where women's voices sing (270 - 500 hz)--that's the octave starting at middle C (C4 to C5)--the main part of women's singing range. I'm sure if you are listening to other types of music that you might not even notice this; but for me, it was a deal-breaker.

  Just so you know where I come from, I own the original ATHM50's and is still my favorite headphones. When hooked just as it is to my mp3 player it makes long plane flights enjoyable. When it is hooked to my portable headphone amp, it takes music to a whole level.Now this model which is wireless, is as good as the wired version. My only issue not being to run through a amp but that is minor and is actually great since taking a plane it is one less thing to take or lose not mention the cables needed. The sound is great and bass emphasized but too large degree. As the old fairy tale says, just right. I do wish I could pipe through an amp but it is fine I can'tIt has no ANC but that's fine, the over ear design muffle engine pretty. Once the music is going, I sit back and relax.

  Don't buy these with intentions to use them for long periods of time, as they barely make it around my ears and hurt both my ears and the top of my head. I bought these intending to plug them into my guitar amp in order to listen to myself playing without bothering the family and neighbors. These are used as my secondary pair of headphones and are currently plugged into my Focusrite audio interface for my AT2020. My main pair of headphones are Razer Kraken Tournament Edition, of which are the second pair I've purchased, though I'm looking to soon replace them with some decent lightweight wireless headphones. This pair of headphones feel like a real waste of money.

  Having a relatively large head, these cans seemed tk make sense.  Head is not huge, but definitely on the larger side of medium.The sound quality easily justifies the price.  I would say these are an inexpensive way to dip a toe into the audiophile range of headphones/earbuds.However, they don't stay comfortable.  I can wear them with ease set to one of the larger head widths, but needing glasses makes for an awkward setup.  I have decided to wear the glasses on top of the cups so I can wear them for up to 2 hours before the discomfort sets in.These are hands-down the absolute best headphones I've ever owned.  I simply wish I could wear them comfortably for over 90 minutes.

  I wanted to find headphones with accurate sound - good clean bass and balanced mid's and hi's .Headphone sound is a matter of personal preference, and all 'phones I have tried claimed extremely wide frequency response. But I can guarantee they were not flat - all had coloration.The ATH-M50x 'phones come close to what I was looking for -  bass slightly boomy -but fairly good without being ear vibrating, but did find the treble  response a bit weak. Just seem slightly ""in your face"" - the vocals seemed very close. Overall, these are fairly good over ear closed back headphones.

  So I love the fact it Bluetooth, quality is great. Day to day and for music and gaming listening. I do though use the cable when producing and mixing as I feel it delivers a bit more and that is understandable.Very happy with the purchase! build quality is good. I know these are gonna be around for years to come.I am glad that I chose these over the other Sennheiser, Sony, Bose and beats options. This just ticks all the boxes for me.It has no active noise cancellation, but long battery life. I knew that and would choose this option again. And believe me, when its over my ears, its quiet. When the music is on, there is no other noises and I am using them in a factory.So far standard pads work the best on these, will try out sheepskin pads soon for durability and comfort, as long as it doesn't change the sounds profile which everyone loves.

  They sound great, which inst a surprise. BUT the support for doing anything other than listening to music on a phone is pretty abysmal. I can't watch movies/youtube on my pc, the lag is just too annoying. Forget about doing anything where precision is key, no way i would use these for serious sound editing when the sound is behind video by HALF A SECOND sometimes. Its odd because i had a bluetooth adapter on my regular m50x's and the lag was never noticeable, like AT ALL, but i just got tired of the small battery on those kinds of adapters. What a disappointment that i can't just switch these out with my old wired ones and go on with my life. How on earth is the sound latency better on some cheap POS Bluetooth adapter than the built in Audio Technica version?So i install the VERY LIMITED audio techinica app to try to change the streaming codec. It seems to switch codecs but it makes no difference, still laggy. Finally, while i was struggling with the app (you will see why is has 2.2 stars on the app store)  the left side just STOPPED WORKING. Like no sound from the left side after a few minutes of exceedingly light use. Guess i'll be returning these and keeping my wired versions a bit longer.

  I bought this as a gift so please take this with a grain of salt as my friend told me about their experience.They are easy to use, comfortable, the sound quality is great and worth the purchase. However, when you lean too close to your mic you can hear sound leaking from your headphones. It wasn't expected with lower volumes so it's worth dropping a couple stars. Something about the construction is not up to snuff with what was expected for the hefty price tag of $170.For just listening to stuff these are okay, but for streaming it's not recommended.

  I'm a musician and I have a home studio setup. I needed to upgrade my studio headphones, so I went withAudio-Technica ATH-M50x Professional Studio. This might be the best purchase I've ever made on Amazon. I was skeptical at first of the outstanding reviews, but after many hours of researching the best headphones for under $200, I then decided to go with these. I love the clarity and the tight bass is pure and not overly exaggerated. Some of the reviewers here complained of these headphones sounding ""tinny"" and lacking bass. Well, there are equalizers if you require an insane amount of bass. The bass is just right in my honest opinion and as I have stated previously the bass is tight and accurate.. If you are on the fence about getting these headphones like I was... fear not I definitely recommend these for both the studio and for listening to music. I'm even recommending these to my family and friends. TheAudio-Technica ATH-M50x is also great for games! The sound quality is outstanding on my Mbox 3, Ipod 5th generation video and Iphone 5S.UPDATE as of 12/6/2016 - I'm so thrilled I chose to go with these headphones. I have no regrets about this purchase and I have been rocking out with these headphones with no problems whatsoever. Trust me and just buy these headphones. The sound is pure and amazing. The bass is just right and not overbearing. I find myself listening to Pink Floyd and it just sounds epic!

The sonic characteristics are pristine with crystal clear (but not harsh) highs a balanced midrange and deep, articulate lows.  The presence and sound stage are amazing.  These are the kind of cans that make you look over your right shoulder while listening to music that seems to envelop and surround the listener.They have a very different sound signature than my reference Sennheiser HD-650s; not better or worse, just different.  The HD-650s have a more lush and mellifluous sound while the ATH-M50x is 100% accurate with ultimate clarity.Stop shopping and buy these headphones now!

  Consistent....I have the original M50 and built up my headphones for various uses (Travel, In home studio, podcasting, etc.) and bought these for my Everyday use and travel. The original M50's i used for DJing replacing my old Sony V700's (the Standard for me), and they fit the bill. * was hoping these to be all arounders to replace bluetooth earbuds when I need them too, or just to block out eveyone while working...a few caveates, but workable and hope they last as long as the M50's (which are still in use for studio work and podcasting duties)build quality - It is up there with the M line. Clamping force on the head is there. It feels a but stiffer compared to my M50 and M50X's, but these are brand new, so they should break in quite nicely. By the way...I also replaced the earpads with Brainwaves ProStocks....better noise blocking, and softer on the clamping force for long periods of use.Sound Quality - This is where i dropped it a bit. The sound quality was not up to par when using Bluetooth. I had better quality using the wire (which made sense when using Dolby Atmos that was built into the S10), but again, that's not why I bouth these to begin with....even when My phone was optimized, the sound was lacking. Maybe I need to burn in the headphones, but it would be nice if the audio was just as good out of the box rather than foing theough the hassle of breaking them (so the drivers are good and loose). These are fairly flat, ao its not an issue  for studio use for me, but again, it would be n8ce if they were tuned right out of the box to sound great immediately.Not much to really say...I am looking forward to uaing these, but you think the audio would be up to par to all the other high end headphones that have come out over the last 5 years....the price was good, but for what Im going to need these for, I'm not complaining (I have a full set of M50's, which also means these are my personal favorites).

  Don't believe the reddit threads out there, these aren't meme headphones, they're very high quality and are far more comfortable than people are saying.  I enjoyed the clarity these headphones bring, plus I also do a lot of sound editing and recording so the fact that they don't bleed out audio like my Seinnheiser HD's is fantastic.  I believe in terms of audio quality they're at least on par if not better than the HD 598's that I own, that once again bleed sound something awful, which in retrospect- should not have been my second pair of headphones that I purchased.  I haven't owned many Audio Technica products unfortunately.  I've always seen them as a bit elusive due to high prices for some of their equipment, but these headphones were an excellent buy at the time and were worth every penny.  I would recommend a high quality audio output when utilizing any high impendance headphones, so if you happen to have say, an expensive sound card inside your computer, you'll likely see the full potential of this product.  If not than you might be of the people giving it a negative review.

  I was in the market for a decent wireless headphone that had a decent microphone. The problem with this headset is the the bluetooth that goes with it. It may be a Windows 10 issue, but I had two bad experiences on two different machines (both on Windows 10). On my work laptop, it has build in bluetooth connectivity. When the headset would pair with the laptop, it would create two different sound devices in the system Sound Options. The first was a ""Hands-Free Headset"" and the second was just ""Bluetooth Headphones"". The ""Hands-Free Headset"" mode sounded horrible. The quality was greatly reduced. Maybe this is done since phone calls don't have that great of quality to begin with? I don't know. But, when I would be done with the call, the headset would not automatically switch over to the ""normal"" mode. I would have to manually open the sound settings and change the default device over. Additionally, sometimes during the call, my coworkers would tell me I would cut out. That is because when I would receive an email the sound would switch to the ""normal"" device, and cut off the ""hands-free"" device.On my home desktop, I purchased a bluetooth receiver to use this headset without a wire. A sound delay occurred and was extremely obvious when watching videos or movies.All of these problems went away when I hardwired the headset, though. When wired, the sound quality was great. However, I purchased these to be used as a wireless device. I do not recommend for wireless listening.

  The overall sound is flat, which is good for mixing, but it gets a one star because the headset is so darn uncomfortable and your poor ears will be thrashed in a matter of minutes. No way to adjust. It is because the pads are too small for ears unless you are a child, so where your ears go in, the pads lay on top of ears instead of cradling the ears, and they are way too tight. I do not have big ears at all and am female. I would not even attempt to buy these if you are a grown man with a larger head than mine. Triple Ouch! I am very dissappointed with these. Also noticed that the sound is way too different than other headsets, so mixing to these will cause the mixes to be off too much to rely on them as your mixing headphones.

    The Best Headphones I have ever purchased
  
",5.0,Carl M. Coleman Jr.,"Reviewed in the United States April 9, 2014","









  
  
    
  These headphones are almost perfect in every way.  They sound great, even without an amplifier, but sound even better with one.  They are very comfortable for extended use, and i usually have a  hard time finding headphones that are comfortable for me.  I love the detachable cord and the two additional cords that it comes with.  I own about 8 pairs of headphones hovering around the $50-$150 range and these are by far my favorite.  Very clear and clean bass with crisp mids.  I haven't found any music that does not sound good in these headphones.What makes these cans so great is the comfort and the closed back design.  I've always wanted a pair of great sounding headphones that I can take with me without others around me being aware of what I'm listening to.  These have become my go-to headphones for travel, because of the portability, close back design, comfort, and great sound quality.I let my brother compare them to his Beats (I'm not a fan) and he was amazed at how good they sounded.  These headphones have a rich feature set and a wonderfully clean sound.  I can't recommend them highly enough.I also have a pair of 

  
Sennheiser HD 518









  
  
    
   and the 

  
Grado SR-60i









  
  
    
   and I have to say that I like the sound of M50x's a little better (although it is close). The M50x has a little bit heavier bass than the other two headphones.  Although the bass is heavier, its certainly not overpowering.  My Sennheisers probably have a little bit more range and depth, but the incremental absence of extra bass makes me prefer the M50x.  Sennheiser headphones are not very bass heavy anyway, but a little more bass for certain types of music goes a long way.Most of what I listen to is Christian Hip-Hop, Country, Neo-Soul, and 70's R&B (I know, weird combination).  The country and the Hip-Hop is where these headphones shine the brightest (mostly because of the extra low end).  The Neo-Soul also sounds great. I'm hearing new instruments in the background so much more clearly than I have ever heard them before.  I'm very happy I made this purchase and I am considering upgrading my AMP and possibly adding a DAC although I don't really find a DAC necessary.  If anyone knows of a great portable AMP to go with these headphones, please let me know.

  Sound quality:It sounds fine for its price point but if you are a bass/treble head don't go for these as this product lacks in these fields because it's a more neutral sounding headphone. It will also tin out if a specific noise is played when you mess around with sound quality settings. All in all (for sound): They are great for people creating/monitoring music but not for gamers or people that want to squeeze every drop of goodness out of a song.Comfort:Comfort for me is a huge one alongside sound quality, and compared to other headphones I've had in the past these are sadly lower on the list because after a good hour or two you start to feel an uneasy pain on the top of your head because of minimal padding. There is also not to much padding on the ear cups and you can start to tell after a good hour or even less. All in all (for comfort): it doesn't really make me happy especially for this price pointBuild Quality:In this section these headphones stand out pretty well. It is mostly comprised of strong plastic (it feels good to hold), it has metal like snap points when adjusting the height, they are not to rigid and not to loose (very nice), and they fold up really well for an easy carry. On top of that the ear cups swivel a nice 180 degrees so you can rest them around your neck to your liking. All in all (for build quality): It is amazing in this category, it's well built.Features:This one I didn't really care for too much, so it doesn't impact the review. There are volume up/down and a pause feature as well as skip forward or back for songs. Pressing on the logo activates siri (nice touch). You can go wired or wireless with Bluetooth (which worked like a charm, I could walk around my whole house listening to music while my phone was in my room). All in all (for features): It's great! there are not too many and not too much buttons and everything is quick easy and responsive!Final review:For me they where ok but, headphones that I bought for 60 bucks outclassed these where it mattered to me the most. If you can handle ok comfort and neutral sound quality (good for music making/monitoring) these are a great fit for you!Side note:I love to listen to music that has rich (not over the top) bass and very clean audio, I also like to game (which can take over 3 hours of my time). When I first put them on they where fine but when I kept playing games I just started to notice my ears and the top of my head feeling uneasy. And when I went to listen to music it was to neutral for me and I heard things I didn't want to.

  These are the best headphones I've ever owned.  Buy these right now.  You will not regret this purchase.  I've not compared them to any other semi-professional headphones, but I have compared them to some ""gaming headphones"" purchased as a gift for someone else.  The cups on these ATH-M50X headphones swivel and tilt, so they conform to your head no matter what the shape or size.  They also have an even seal around your ears.  Other over-ear headphones I've tried don't all do this, so this is a serious plus.  The included pads are super soft and seal VERY well.  I can listen at (too) high volume, and people can't hear them at work, and our office is pretty quiet most of the time.  The included coiled cable is a little long for my use, but the short one works great at my desk or if I'm travelling with these and using with my phone.  These aren't noise cancelling, but with how well they seal, I imagine they'd be decent on a plane.  I'll try to update this review once I've tried them on a plane.Update: after a few years the leatherette of the ear cups is disintegrating, which is not uncommon, but still disappointing. The headphones are just okay on a plane, but even cheap earbuds seal better for noise isolation. In a normal room they're still the best headphones I've ever owned. Still recommended, but maybe buy a replacement set of ear cups.

  Only thing I dislike about this is they are a  little power hungry.Came in a nice box, had 3 different cables, and a 1/4 inch adapter. Came with a soft leather case to store them in. Hooked them up to my Note 4 cell phone and worked real good.Audio was clear. Bass wasn't bad, my son has Beats by Dre, and this sounds better with more bass than his.Blue color doesn't make it sound any better, however does add a bit of flash.Now granted, the black color is cheaper, but I thought what the hell, to be honest I wanted the red pair but amazon was out.

    My Favorite All-Around Headphones
  
",5.0,Cthulhu Jones,"Reviewed in the United States March 25, 2015","









  
  
    
  I am by no means an audiophile, and these are my first headphones that I've spent more than $100 to purchase. However, these headphones have definitely raised my awareness of the quality of recordings I listen to. I've never been able to hear very well the difference between a standard MP3 downloaded from Amazon or iTunes and that of a lossless file until listening with these headphones. I have been reintroduced to old favorites with new detail or with a clarity I've never heard before. It has plenty of bass without being overpowering or muddling the mid and low range like a pair of Beats or Monsters do. If you listen exclusively to bass heavy music and like that sound you may be a little disappointed, but if you have a wider palette then I think these definitely provide a nice, real-world balance so that they produce good sound in a wide variety of situations. I've listened to classical, metal, and played video games with them and been pleased with them in each case.That aside I like the build of the headphones. I find them comfortable and usually wear them for an hour or more (occasionally 4 or 5 hours at a time) and haven't gotten warm, sore, or a headache from the fit. They do a pretty good job of passively canceling out a lot of noise. They come with 3 headphone cables - a short and a long straight cable, and a mid-length curly cable that stretches out longer than the straight cable. It comes with 2 screw-on 1/4 adapters, though only the long and curly cable are threaded. The included cables are keyed so that they can be inserted into the phones and locked, though non-keyed cables will work fine. It comes with a leatherette pouch that once folded up the phones will fit in, but with cable included it's a tight fit so I see myself finding an alternative at some point. All in all I am exceptionally happy with these headphones.

    Built Like a Tank, Awesome Sound
  
",5.0,Tyler B.,"Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've been using these for about a year now, and I love them. I used their predecessor (ATH-M50) for probably seven years before I bought these.  These are very comparable in sound and build, they seem like the same headphones sans wires and with buttons.  Let me tell you, I beat the crap out of those headphones, and they held up wonderfully.  They started looking rough after a while, but they never broke.The sound on these headphones is really great. It's not for everyone, the emphasis is on clarity rather than bass. I love them for jazz, bluegrass, folk, lighter rock, and things like that. I'll sometimes switch to different pair for metal, harder rock, and some electronica.  They feel weak when you're listening to noisy, bass-heavy music where the clarity of the headphones doesn't do anything for you and the less exaggerated bass response takes away from the music.The battery life on these things is great. I use them off and on throughout the workday, and I generally charge them once or twice a week.  They do take a long time to charge, so it's best to plan ahead a little and charge overnight. This might make them a poor on-the-go choice for some folks, but you'll run into issues with their weight and bulk first for those uses.  The controls are simple and easy to use.  The buttons feel like they'll keep up with the rest of the headphone in terms of durability.  I don't really use the touch-for-voice-assistant control, but it does work if you're into that sort of thing.They don't have active noise cancellation, but they do passively block out noise pretty well.  Word to the wise, glasses do interfere with that noticeably.  Not a big deal in a quiet(ish) office, on planes I'll take my glasses off to help block out noise.  I don't think that's unique to these, it's just a fact of life with over-ear headphones.Overall they're great headphones, worth every penny.  Hopefully someday they'll switch from USB-B Micro to USB-C, but I think it was a fair trade to get these to market at a good price.

    Absolutely live up to the hype
  
",5.0,Sean Kelling,"Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2015","









  
  
    
  These headphones are, by far, the best purchase I made all year (in 2014).I did extensive research on several pairs of over the ear headphones from several manufacturers over a several month period before finally settling on the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x's.  To give a little background, I am a huge fan of all kinds of music and consider myself a casual listener with some audiophile tendencies.  My budget was $200 max, so for the money, these headphones are the best value out there if you're not willing to spend upwards of $400 or more for true audiophile quality cans.These headphones had everything I was looking for: quality, balanced sound (with maybe a slight emphasis on bass, which is definitely alright by me), a collapsible & attractive design, durability and flexibility, light weight, a detachable cord (and these cans come with 3 cords--a great value!), and of course, they fit my budget.Most importantly, the sound is so crystal clear.  There is no muddling in the lows and the mids truly shine.  Highs are also pitch perfect.  These aren't the best headphones for bassheads, but they definitely deliver a good, deep boom in my opinion.The only concern I had when I bought these headphones was that they may be too bulky or uncomfortable but I have used them for hours on end several times since I first bought them last week and have found my worries were for nothing.  They are a breeze to wear and while they are larger headphones, they aren't too ostentatious.  They truly are a joy to wear and use.If you are on the fence about these headphones, don't wait any longer.  These headphones really do live up to the hype.

  Okay, so my original review (below) from 2014 still stands. Seeing as it has been a few years owning these headphones, I thought it was about time for an update. These headphones are more than I looked for, and I am quite impressed. These things have retained their quality, all throughout. Still some of the best headphones for the money to buy. I am watching a movie and thought to myself, these things still sound good years later! Hoping to get more years out of these.Some of the best Headphones I've ever had. Better than the Beats Mixr. The Bass doesn't hit as hard, but he overall quality of the bass, mids, highs and lows is superb. They take a bit of adjusting to because I wear glasses, but they're comfortable for hours. I wear them at work for almost my entire shift. Highly recommended. Best headphones under $200

    UPDATED REVIEW AFTER 2+ YEARS OF OWNERSHIP - DON'T LISTEN TO THE CRITICS OR HYPE. READ THIS.
  
",3.0,Zeke,"Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2019","









  
  
    
  For starters, these are recommended from the various YT reviewers because they are LOUD, or better, can get loud and really in your face sound wise since its VERY bass oriented. Most people think loudness equals quality which we know is NOT true.  Like most things in audio, these are going to be VERY subjective cans, and I laugh at the people that mock these the same as those that praise them to be the best. They are FAR from the best. They should not be praised or mocked, but appreciated for what they are meant to be used for. Studio monitoring, and banging your head to amazing overly aggressive bass while maintaining VERY good detail. Very narrow, vocals and other instruments may sound ""confined"" when compared to more open headphones. But that's why there is no ""pair does it all"" headphone. Its just not possible.Three stars because I love these cans, but they have a lot of flaws IMO. Had them for over 2 years now, DEF broke them in. Build quality is not bad. Its not amazing, but its above average for sure. Again, had them for 2+ years and they still hold up VERY well.The original pads are GARBAGE. Absolute garbage. They are tiny, they make your ear sweat and press on your earpad and really hurt after 30 minutes. Cables are GARBAGE, the headband is HUGE, and it itches after around 1 hour of use. I have to size them JUST right which is very annoying.However - IF - you get NEW deeper larger pads, IF you break them in, and IF you use (even if these don't need to, I know) even a cheap entry level DAC / DAC-AMP like the BTR5 (more amp? what? YOU MUST BE INSANE!), and IF you're into hip-hop and electronic music and want to REALLY hear that BOM BOM BOM BOM to where yes.. there will be tracks you will go ""oh F that's too much"".. then these are going to rock your F soul and you're gonna love them.IF you're someone that likes speakers-like audio, open air sounds, more sound stage more openness.. etc. etc.,  which of course we all appreciate as well but..  NOPE! You're going to throw these away and do all sorts of rituals against it because you may as well think these are Satan's cans.. But if you love acid techno like I do.. these can be a lot of fun. But that's it, and studio monitoring but I mean, yeah..Do I recommend them for above $100 bucks? No. ( I got them for $120)Do I recommend them for lower than 100? Maybe? If you read above, you decide.Do I recommend them if you want mainly listen to hip-hop and electronic, bass oriented music? -  F YES!Don't listen to these self-proclaimed ""audiophiles"" that rip on these because THEY don't like them so neither should you. That is BS. They clearly have a DIFF taste and listen to diff music. Simple as that. These are QUALITY cans with MAJOR flaws design-wise but that serve a SPECIFIC purposes and do it VERY WELL.PS: They do not have good sound stage or imagining, which makes me wonder why these clueless reviewers suggest them for gaming. These are not for gaming at all. The moment you see a vid suggesting these for gaming, unsub, they are clueless. You need open-back with wide sound stage and near perfect imaging for gaming, not bass oriented closed-backs. Come on now..

    Not flat, but that’s what makes it good.
  
",5.0,Akshit Anand,"Reviewed in the United States March 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  The primary purpose was sound that I would live. Obviously, only laymen in the audiophile world would ever consider them flat headphones. Yet, for people who keep using the senn 6xx, or hifiman or even the aria or the 800s, the m50-x is a breath of fresh air. The bass is tight, and yet the sound profile has limited variability to ensure an almost flat response. The closed back nature does not help the soundstage much, but as with most closed back cans, what we sacrifice in soundstage we gain in noise isolation. Of course, it isn’t the best choice for a beginner if they’re looking for accuracy and flatness, but for audiophiles who want to rediscover a little joy and even infatuation in the music that they listen to, these are a cheap, travel-worthy option to consider.

  I've had AT earbuds before and loved them. These are exactly what I've been looking for: reasonably priced, good (but not bass-head level) bass, decent soundstage. I listen to a lot of classical and instrumental music as a casual listener, and these sound good enough for my purposes. Some older orchestral recordings don't seem to get a lot of separation in instruments. Pop, R&B, and EDM sound fantastic. Ran my favorite ""test"" songs through them and didn't get any of the clipping or harsh brightness that cheaper pairs give.Only note (but not enough to take away a star): I'm a petite person, and the band-to-strap sizing is just verging on too big for me. I think I'll add some padding to the brace that goes over the top of the head so it fits better.

I think they are a great pair of introductory headphones for audiophiles on a budget. Comfort could be improved a little but stock cushions are fine. When the music kicks in they do a great job of drowning out most everyday sounds.

  Up until this point, I've never owned Audio Technica headphones...There are no words to express how these headphones sound. It's the type of product that you need to try for yourself.I have never heard headphones this good in my life! If your phone has aptX, your in luck because these headphones support it. Pair that with Spotify ""very high aka extreme quality"" then your golden.Bass is just right, highs and mids are perfect. You end up noticing flaws in some songs that the artists didnt notice!They feel amazing and cancel noise like you wouldnt believe! Even if you have volume at max, which we'll get to in a second, there is very, very little leak.About the volume...For years, I've always maxed my volume out. These...are different. This get VERY loud! So loud that I have to keep the volume at about 80%! I've never had to turn down the volume on headphones so that should tell you something.I havent tried watching movies with it but havent noticed latency with YouTube videos.Would I suggest these headphones? Yeah...yeah I would.Best headphones for under $200 by far. Bye, bye Bose and Sony; Audio Technica has come to play!

    Great sound and that's really what matters
  
",5.0,Jeff,"Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  First, this is really a 4.5 star review, but if I have to round up or down, I'm inclined to round up. These headphones aren't perfect, but they are better than ""80%"" good.I've been looking for a while for headphones that actually sound good without breaking the bank. It's surprisingly hard to find anything in the sub-$300 range (really the sub-$600 range) that has a sound profile that's basically neutral but just on the side of pleasing. Most consumer-level headphones have vastly overemphasized bass, terrible mid-range and sibilant highs. That's true even of headphones considered expensive at this level, like the Sony WM-1000XM4's, which I tried before these. Yes, you can adjust the EQ on those, but the drivers just aren't tuned well for anything but how it comes set from the factory. So you can get less bass and more midrange, but the sound quality just ends up being really harsh and just... bad.Alternately, a lot of higher-end headphones have *under*-emphasized bass, which is a side effect of an open-back design. I had a pair of expensive Sennheisers when I was younger (no idea what happened to them) that had this issue, and in looking at various reviews on the net (such as at rtings.com), not much has changed in current models.The ATHM50X's are apparently intended to be studio monitors, but I don't personally think they're quite accurate enough for that except in maybe a home studio setup. The sound stage is very much in your ear rather than all around you, so in that sense they'd make for good monitors, but the overall sound profile is what they call ""consumer friendly"", ie. it's intended to sound *good*, not 100% accurate.That said, if you look at the actual frequency response graphs at any review site, you'll see that these are very accurate considering the price point - way better than you'll find with some of the trendier headphones out there. And they do give you that sub-bass response too, without it being too over-emphasized (they are a closed-back design). So I think AT did a really good job in balancing neutrality with just making music sound a little better. These won't give you that muddy ""thump"" but they don't sound shrill or tinny either. The mid-range, which honestly is where most of the music is, sounds great - not harsh or compressed as it does in most consumer headphones. And the highs sound clear, maybe a tad underemphasized but not at all sibilant. Very nice.Comfort and build quality is where I'd made take a half star off. They have a pretty high clamping force compared to most other headphones I've tried, and I was concerned initially that this would make them hard to wear for long listening sessions. And no, they're not ideal for that, but I will say that I kind of just got used to it rather than it becoming less bearable over time. The earpads are also on the thin side, but I understand these are easy to change and many other pad styles are available (they also can use pads intended for other headphones). In terms of construction quality, the headphones are mostly plastic, although the headband itself is metal. They are light, though.These are $30 more than the fully wired (non-Bluetooth) version of these headphones. I figured for that price difference, it was worth the upgrade. Bluetooth seems to work fine, although from what I understand the best codecs these support are AAC and AptX (not AptX HD, and no LDAC). Of course they will drop down to SBC if that's all your devices have - SBC is kind of the lowest common denominator. If you have Bluetooth, you have at least that. But honestly, in most cases it's really hard to tell the difference between codecs anyway.You can still use these as wired headphones too, and that's mostly how I've been testing their sound quality, with high-res FLAC files (so not relying on lossy compression in either the file or the transmission, or the DAC in the headphones themselves). They come with a pretty short, thin wire with mini-plugs on both ends - good for using with a phone or portable DAP, but probably not sitting on a couch attached to an amp or receiver. You can of course upgrade to a longer and/or coiled proper headphone cable if you want, and I plan to at some point. But it's obviously an extra expense.Keeping on the theme of included (or not) accessories, these do come with a charging cable, and a really basic leatherette ""bag"" to carry or store them in. Honestly the lack of a proper case doesn't bother me too much... if I'm traveling I'll probably be carrying my cheap set of noise canceling headphones rather than these. But it's something to consider if you do want to carry these around with you everywhere. Also keep in mind that these do *not* have active noise canceling! I feel like that's getting to be such a common feature even in cheap headphones that it's necessary to mention if a set of $180 headphones does not have it. These do not. They do block a lot of noise just through their overall design (passive noise cancelation), but there are no electronics to assist with that. These are old-school headphones with Bluetooth added, that's it.But I do think I've found my headphones for sound quality without going broke. They're a good value if sound is your primary concern over all else.

  I might not be the best person to ask as this is my first set of nice headphones. They are great though. They sound very clean and make music more of a joy to listen to. The Bluetooth is nice. These work great for gaming as well as music. I have a fairly eclectic taste. These sound great. They are more of a flat sound so if you are a bass head these may not be the best for you but you can hear things way more clearly. For the first time I could clearly pick out all of the string instruments when listening to classical music. I recommend these and would buy them again.

  I purchased Audio-Technica headphones on Amazon on October 2019 from a seller named Tech Sales USA. Seven months later, the right headphone stopped working completely. I believed all AT products come with a two-year warranty, but when I looked this up on the AT website, I found that Tech Sales USA is on an ""Unauthorized Online Resellers"" list and therefore is not eligible for warranty. At the time of purchase, I bought two pairs of the same headphones (ATH M50x)—one from a legit dealer, and the other not—both from the same Amazon page. Guess which one has stopped working. At the time, I believed I was buying directly from Amazon Services, because that is what I initially selected from the Amazon search window. However, the seller changed without my notice to an unauthorized dealer when I switched the preferred product color. Amazon needs to do a much better job being transparent to customers about who they are buying products from and alert you when the seller changes suddenly because you wanted (for instance) black headphones instead of blue ones. Amazon should also be much more forthcoming about which sellers are actually authorized dealers and which are going to send products not eligible for a warranty. I'm not abdicating all responsibility for this—I do a ton of homework when I buy products—but when the seller changes midstream simply because you tweaked something minor on the page, that's willful deception on Amazon's part and I think we deserve better.I've contacted Tech Sales USA to inform them about the defective product they've sent me. I'll update this review when I hear how they plan to remedy the situation.

When I plugged these headphones into the Pioneer and started listening, WOW! Everything sounds cleaner, I'm hearing notes and sounds that I never got from the music before. I think that if I could, I'd just sit here for days on end and just listen to all of my music till my ears got tired of having the headphones on.

  I am a Live sound engineer.  I had gone through at least 2 pairs of M50 (from losing them, etc) since I started using them in 2009 (10 years!).  It was time for another order, since I lost my last pair while touring, so I got these so I can have the added benefit of bluetooth (for general music listening, not necessarily work).Wired worked great and sounded very similar to my prior m50's, I still need to figure out what other cables I can use (whether I need TRRS on the headphone side for it to work properly or if a 3.5mm TRS male to TRS male would work.)Bluetooth worked great for a couple weeks, then suddenly every non-wired sound (both the internal ""power on"", ""bluetooth connect"" sounds and actual bluetooth audio) started sounding very distorted and weak and quiet, and the right channel wouldn't come through or would be intermittent.  At first I thought the battery was simply on the verge of dying, but charging it fully didn't help.  Something broke internally.  However, using wired still worked fine.  I returned and ordered a replacement. Hope it doesn't happen again.All of my prior M50's were very rugged, I probably dropped them hundreds of times, they lived at the bottom of my backpack underneath heavy stuff, and I had blasted them with super high sound levels for long periods of time many times (while doing live sound and they were sitting next to the desk, fortunately not while I was wearing them, like ""oops I had the headphone volume all the way up for the last hour of this loud rock show"").I'm really hoping the additional electronics inside the BT version aren't fragile, and that this was just a fluke, because I want to continue loving these.

    Amazing headphones, don't love the stock earpads
  
",5.0,Zachary Wolfe,"Reviewed in the United States December 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  These headphones are amazing, especially for the price. I'm recommending to anyone that asks for a new headset.The one downside I have is the stock earpads. When monitoring a mic, the material and extra-closed nature make  my own voice very loud in my head (like I'm talking while my hands are covering my ears or something).I bought a set of the Brainwavz Velor Foam Earpads which made these headphones perfect by opening up the sound stage a little bit.

  using this for home music and Foley recording studio monitoring. comfortable, physically stable (doesn’t fall off). seems like a good flat response, but i don’t have means to measure - purely subjective opinion here.not cheap, but not out of the world, pricewise, either. i feel like i am getting my money’s worth. again, that’s subjective.  i would buy it again as long as it died of age and regular wear and tear.

  Cons: Like any faux leather headphones, they can make the area surrounding your ears hot after using them for an extended period of time.  This, however, is a minor, acceptable issue.Pros:  These headphones are incredibly comfortable.  They feel very well constructed, which his important because I'm not known for being delicate.  I use the products I purchase, and I use the heck out of them.  Even the cables feel like they've been designed to last.  Though I've never accidentally reached the end of the cable (I use the half-coiled stereo cable), a fact that can be attributed to the cable's length, I don't feel like I could rip out of the headphones with a good pull.  The audio quality is crisp and precise; it's well balanced and sounds good on everything from audio books to folk music, hip hop to rock and roll.Other:  For me, these fit my head, budget, and musical tastes better than Beats.  Even the aesthetics of the headphones are more appealing to me.  5 stars well earned.

  For $179 though, I have to say I’m a little disappointed. I expected more “wow” factor. I’d hoped for better dynamic clarity, richer bass without muddying the mids and highs. Honestly, I can’t hear much if any difference between these and my $70 Phillips headphones. And at a relatively normal volume, everyone in the room is annoyed at how loud they are. They don’t sound bad but if you’re looking for a step up in quality from your ~$100 set, I can’t recommend these.

  This review is only for bluetooth usage of these headphones.I want a simple bluetooth head phone that is comfortable and sounds somewhat okay.  Long story short, these sound pretty bad and make it hard to intuitively switch between bluetooth devices.Connecting out of the box was easy enough.  There is a light static noise whether listening to music or not.  When I tried to connect to my phone I could not pair.  I had to disconnect from my computer firsts and then pair, which is annoying.  So I installed the new firm ware.  Issue persisted.  I can't devices easily and it sounds bad.  Hope others had better experiences.Best thing about these: they are super comfortable.  And the sound was very good with audio plugged in (I know this is expected, but other bluetooth devices I have just are leaps and bounds better sounded than these)

  I did a lot of research on headphones with good bass, clear sound and comfort while wearing.  I then went and spent time in the store actually testing them out before making a decision.  I am glad I picked this one.  It has great sound and is very comfortable to wear.  I wear glasses and they did not cause any discomfort while wearing the headphones.  I have had these for a little over a year now and I love them.  I have taken them on two trips to the Philippines and used them on the long haul flights.  Longest flight so far was just under 16 hours and I wore them for most of the flight (I can't sleep on planes).  They are great for music, movies, podcasts and audio books although audio books and some podcasts can be a bit more difficult in loud areas because they are not noise cancelling.  Love that they will lay flat on my chest so that I can keep them on comfortably while not listening to music or podcasts.  The only downsides are that they do not have a wireless option without purchasing additional product and that they are not noise cancelling.  I wanted the cord since I was going to be using them for long haul flights and didn't want to worry about them running out of battery but it would be nice if they sold a pair that did both.  With that said, there is an adapter that will convert them to wireless and even though they are not noise cancelling, they do a decent job of blocking out noise.

  I love the sound of these headphones!Having said that, The headphones are big and clunky. I'm not sure I would want to walk down the street wearing them. But for at home or work they are a good choice, in my opinion. I find them very comfortable. They also seem rugged. The headphones use Bluetooth 5.0, which is the latest version. They are fine for watching YouTube and other videos. I haven't noticed any sync issues that concern me. I have noticed two drawbacks: It is only possible to pair one Bluetooth device to the headphones. I haven't found a quick and easy way to switch from one device to another in an Apple environment. I think these are best left paired to one device. Charging is via micro USB. USB-C would have been better. Even with these drawbacks, I really like them. The sound blows my socks off. I think they are worth the $200 price tag.

  Fantastic headphones. Worth more than the price they are asking these days. I find these a step up from the pricier AT-900 Art Monitors I've been using. Crisp mids and highs. Tight, but not overpowering bass. They are good for everything, not just one genre of music. I look forward every day to coming home and listening to my favorites like I've never heard before, and appreciating new music in the best way under 300.00 that you can find.  My test music for new cans is NIN The Fragile, and later Yello cd's, but I listen to everything from Bowie, techno, metal, dance music, classical, both digital and vinyl, and it all sounds incredible. And, that is without any of the fancy headphone amps that are out there that I see talked about in many reviews.  They do have a snug fit, so it can bother some after long periods of wearing, but they are solid. The fact they they give you 3 different length detachable cords is astonishing considering how may companies relish in making you buy extra stuff for their product. Like others have said, I can't recommend these headphones enough.

  I am a musician so I had to choose between many headphones to fit my picky ears...After some serious comparison between this, Beyerdynamics DT990/770, and bunch of AKG, and Sony MDR7506, I chose this. This might not be the flatest headphones(flatness is subjective too, and our ears don't really perceive sounds as flat any way. This is very close to harman target, which again is not THE most accurate standard at all), but boy it makes the music sound amazing and alive! Music is not flat! The bass accuracy is insane. Only complaint is may be it's a little bit harsh and the comfort is good but not the best, but its sound will cancel out all this.

  I bought these based on the M50x reviews, expecting that the Bluetooth capacity would give them even more versatility, but... you can forget about making/receiving calls using them wireless, the mic is amazingly bad, you can't rely on it to keep a fluent conversation, you'll need to plug the cable (which mic  works perfectly) to be able to make calls.In the audio department, there's no doubt these are made by an expert company like Audio-Technica, it's clean and balanced, you can hear every detail very clearly. The bass is not too deep, which for me and for everyone who thinks of to use them in studio is something to highlight.These headphones are also very comfortable to use and are well made. You can find better construction quality or design, but not in this price range.Finally, the battery lasts forever.

",5.0,Jake Albano,"Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2018","









  
  
    
  I've own these headphones for two years now, with absolutely no problems. No broken wires, and more importantly, nothing within the headphones has broken. Spending 150 dollars two years ago is a hell of a lot cheaper than spending 50 every 6 months to replace a pair a cheaply built headphones, definitely worth the price to invest higher in your headphones. The design of these headphones also allows you to conviently fold up and carry them with you. Perfect for traveling. All around fantastic design.Now onto the actual sound of these things; fantastic. These are balanced headphones, there is no ""bass boosting"" or anything of the likes, these allow you to hear the music as the artists have produced it. Everything comes across crystal clear. The highs don't hit a screeching frequency that makes you cringe, the lows are muddied with static, and the mids are there to hold everything together. If you've never listened to music with a decent set of speakers or headphones before, you probably don't understand how many dynamics you're missing. Music is, and sound in general, a very 3 dimensional space. The right music will allow you to feel sounds from not just the sides of your ears, but seemingly in front, behind, above and below you. Thus, for anyone truly interested in listening to music in the right way, it's important to have headphones that can capture these 3D elements.As a student in an audio engineering course, and a music lover, these headphones provide both the sanctification of listening to music, as well as being able to mix music at home, without expensive sound insulation and studio monitors.Highly recommend this product.

  I am so glad that I decided to purchase this headphone. Yes, they are very comfortable to wear even after after several hours of wearing them; no fatigue. But the high quality audio produced by the headphones was something I really didn't expect.

They sound great and are comfortable to put on, rest around neck and maneuver while I mix. I am very happy with these headphones and their clear and high quality sound. They do fold up for better portability. The detachable cord slot makes it easy to switch between the 3 different length cords that come with the headphones that have 3.5 mm headphone jacks. There is also an adapter for a 1/4""(6.3mm) jack. I did not get the Bluetooth adapter.They are not really noise cancelling , but they are decent for knocking down external noise. I have not used them in a club for DJing, so I have no idea how good they are for blocking out loud PA systems. Very good product for the price.

  Awesome sound, as expected. I also own the $30 ATH series, which I use for console gaming, but when it comes to PC gaming, I wanted the very best. These are certainly no exception to that! Crisp highs, mids, and lows. The best sound quality I've experienced to date.Edit: I've owned these headphones for 2 and a half years now, and the black cushions are starting to dry rot and crumble to pieces, leaving black flakes all over my ears and neck after using them for extended periods of gaming. The sound quality has diminished a bit too, particularly the lows and highs, leaving me to speculate about the long term durability of the materials used to make the driver. I will soon be replacing these headphones, solely because of the crumbling cushions, which also happened with my last pair of headphones (Sony).

  These headphones sound damn incredible. I am extremely satisfied with this purchase. The price is also in good place. I have yet to plug into amplifier to push them further, but these puppys are plenty loud coming out of a phone or a laptop. The M50X has an excellent range. Bass is consistent and rumbly. Oscillating bass lines are distinct and audible. Mids and Trebs are clean and separate from the bass creating a full, rich sound. They are comfortable, and reduce listening fatigue. I highly recommend.Comes with 3 different cables for amp hookup or standard headphone jack. Great for making mixes on the tables or playing an instrument through an amp!They are little bulky but no so much so that it looks weird. Gotta put those drivers somewhere!! Audio is clearly heard from outside the headphone. These headphones ""breath'"" so the sound is better, but if cranked up everyone around you can hear the music. ;)

The sound quality is crisp and clear, almost as if this is the way you're intended to hear it. The bass is amazing as well too. It even sounds great when using it on PC games. My only gripe with it, is that I tend to get complaints from others when using them on the phone, stating they can't hear me as well (which is why I gave it 4 stars for sound quality).

  I absolutely love these headphones. I've had them for about 6 months and I'm still in love with them. The leather is soft and the padding completely surrounds my ears rather than just smooshing them back which is great because my ear cartilage piercings aren't being smooshed. The sound quality is amazing and the overall look of the headphones is fantastic. A friend of mine would always use my headphones whenever she came over and she eventually decided to buy herself a pair because she loved them more than her brand new Beats headphones. I think she gave her Beats headphones to her mom after she got her new black Audio-Technica headphones. The only issue with the white headphones is that they can get dirty easily if you dont be careful and you dont take care of them. I had to buy a special stand to put my headphones on when I'm not wearing them so they don't get any random stains which is fine I didn't mind buying the stand it was cheap and it does the job, but overall I'd definitely recommend this product.

  They feel good, have clear sound (wired),  and have good battery life. The wired option is convenient and I have no problems with it.Non affecting things. The mike volume is based on the headset sound not your device as a heads up. It's not a problem just the way it is. The touch for assistant option is interesting but I disabled my assistant.My cons are with the bluetooth settings. the sink system looses connection at the beginning of every video, add, and song for several seconds. When it connects it pops like you pulled out an aux plug or put too much sound into a speaker (when set to bluetooth) . Best I have gotten is loose the first second or two. There is a constant feed back sound no matter what settings I use. The sound is a constant poping buzz that does not go away and starts as you turn on the headphones. That is before any Bluetooth is connected. I returned the first pair for the same problem. Needing your GPS on to use the app at all is annoying. As well as how little it does might just delete the app.In my opinion get a pair of beats if you want bluetooth. Or for wired get any gaming headset. The comfert difference is not worth the extra cash. Pass on these.

  Excellent and powerful headphones. Amazing clarity. I love how these are shaped to fit over the natural shape of ears. I love the removable cable and the fact it comes with 3 different cable lengths. No more buying new phones due to wear/tear of its cable...simply replace the cable. The sound quality is beautiful, even with my not-so-great hearing. I use these on tablet/Nexus phone for audiobooks and music without issue. I use them on my computer that has a powered soundcard, thus making the phones sound super rich in bass and highs - all at 30% volume. I also use them for sound monitoring on my Tascam audio recorder when doing documentary film/interview work, an area where it is important to monitor and reproduce audio quality.Sure, they are big, but they aren't meant for you to take to the gym or on your jog; they are meant to reproduce sound as if you were there. They are comfortable to wear for long periods of time and the cushion-seal around your ear not only provides extreme comfort, but a sealed environment in which an orchestra appears to live in your eardrums. This investment will make you happy for a very long time :)

  I'm writing this review after using these headphones for over 4 years. I have three other heaphones, so I haven't used these steadily, but I have used them regularly. I have just oredered the Audio Technica branded replacement ear pads, as the originals have not torn, but much of the vinyl coating has worn off. The rest of the unit is nearly pristine after 4 years, so I consider them to be very durably made. As to sound, all I can say is that after being used for my kind of music (classical) and not abused, it is superb. The bass is just right, and highs, especially vocal highs are clean and pure. With use the sound quality has improved year by year. This says a lot for the idea that headphones benefit from breaking in on the kind of music one loves. One of my other headphones is the Oppo PM-3, highly praised for their sound quality, and I can say without a doubt that the ATH-M50x sounds just as good, perhaps even a little better on instrumental and vocal highs. That makes the ATH-M50x a great bargain, at a little over 1/3 the price of the Oppo PM-3, particularly given that Oppo has now gone out of business. I don't think you can find a better sounding or more durable headphone at any where close to the price of these.

  First things first, 5 stars defines sound quality for this price point. For $150 these are amongst some of the best sounding closed back headphones out there (better than $300 studio Beats FYI, I would know, I had them before my producing days). Occasionally the extremely high frequency treble can appear a bit harsh but the clarity and balance throughout the sound spectrum is great. As an audio engineer, these are great for monitor use AND mixing purposes. The noise cancellation is pretty impressive considering there is little, if any, deterioration in audio quality (with greater noise cancellation you typically have to sacrifice audio quality). But if you’re an aspiring producer or a music lover on a budget, I would look no further than here.

  I bought these for personal use. I am not an audiophile or professional user, I just wanted high quality sound that did not break the bank. The price point of the M50x headphones coupled with the mostly rave reviews prompted me to order on Saturday. I received them today (Monday) with Amazon Prime and I have to say, the nuances of songs that I listen too are much more evident than in my old Phillips noise cancelling pair that I had for twelve years. I am noticing aspects of songs that I did not notice before because the headphones are so precise in playing every single nuance. Its nice to be able to hear the little things that add to the listening experience. There is a great balance of all ranges so that no particular range such as bass is overemphasized. This makes things sound as though they should. And also, the feel of the headphones are extremely comfortable with the soft padding on the top and around the ears. My old set were metal and had smaller cans so my ears and the top of my head would be sore after 30-45 minutes. Not the case with my new M50x phones, I could wear them for hours. They do look a little bit dorky because of the larger size around the ears, but I don't care how I look as long as it is comfortable. That being said, I had to deduct one star only because of the leakage issue. At either full volume or even half volume, I can take off the headphones, cover them and I can still clearly hear the songs and specific lyrics. So I can see that if I were not alone and in a place such as an airline lounge, gate waiting area or other place with people, it could get annoying to others. Some state that the leakage is less noticeable inflight with aircraft noise and I am hoping that this is the case because I would like to use them while flying.Update 10/2020 - Still works well, but unfortunately, the ear pad cushions wore out and resulted in messy tiny black flakes getting all over the table and near my ears. I just purchased new replacement ear pad cushions for about $20.

    Absolutely great quality sound, as well as very good fit and feel
  
",5.0,Gerry Conway,"Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2018","









  
  
    
  I can't believe how much I like these.  I narrowed my choices down to these and Sennheiser HD1 (I own a really nice pair of Sennheiser EarBuds.)  As far as quality goes, both were about the same; however, these were over $100 cheaper.  The sound quality is excellent.  Very crisp,clear, and above all, accurate.  If I want more Bass-Mid-Treble I can always adjust the source.  In headphones (like speakers) I prefer faithful reproduction of the source material.  The Bass is crisp and not muddled with the mids and highs are clear and well defined.  The soundstage is excellent.  I have no problem closing my eyes and ""seeing"" the field of sound around me.  As for volume, these headphones deliver everything in the proper relationship regardless of volume.  I did not need an amp to use them with my phone or MP3 player.  I also wear glasses so I was concerned with long listening sessions applying undue pressure, but the soft ear-cups mold very well around my glasses.  As others have mentioned, these are not ""noise cancelling,"" but I did find that exterior noise has to be fairly intrusive to past them.The ONLY negative for me was the fact that the straigne relief on the provided cables was intrusively long.  That caused the cord to constantly rub up against my shoulder and be distracting.  I will look for a 90 degree cable to fix that.  I did not reduce my star rating because I do not feel this to be a significant factor in my enjoyment of these.

    Bluetooth and cable both poor quality
  
",1.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2021","









  
  
    
  I did a ton of research before buying these headphones. I wanted an extra pair of closed back headphones that I could use for music production, and I chose these because I could also listen to music on bluetooth or talk on the phone while out and about. I also considered Bose headphones, but chose the Audio Technica because they are known to be more neutral for mixing and audio engineering purposes. I hoped they could be dual purpose for my mix/listening and my personal/phone call use.I was never able to be heard on phone calls without using the detachable cable (which contains a microphone). I cannot find it advertised anywhere if there is a microphone on the body of the headphones. So mine is either defective, or there is simply no microphone, meaning it is impossible to take calls on Bluetooth. Major downside. (It is possible to do this on Bose headphones).I did not end up using these a ton for mixing, the cable did not fit properly into my audio interface adapter so I got pops, clicks, and poor audio quality and my DAW (ABLETON) does not accept Bluetooth as an Output Device. The pops and clicks are more likely a bad adapter, but if the cord were constructed for a screw-on adapter (as on other mix headphones) this would be avoided.For any sounds geeks I will say the times that I have been able to listen to music, I do like the audio quality of the headphones. The stereo field is great. They have just the right amount of bass. Mids are clear. They are not tinny. But again, this has only been possible in a regular AUX jack, not through my interface. So basically only when I am listening to music for leisure, like on my phone or computer. And I would rather due that through Bluetooth, but...the Bluetooth does not work, after using it probably about 10 times.So overall, paying the extra for Bluetooth is not worth it. I would rather just have a version with the cable built in and a screw-on adapter for more reliability.I do intend to return them under warranty. But the process requires to ship Fed Ex, or pay an undisclosed amount as a ""handling fee."" Honestly, I don't think I should pay a penny extra for headphones that I have barely used, and that have barely worked.I'll update this review if Audio Technica comes thru on the warranty or customer service.

    All-around great closed-ear headphones
  
",5.0,Andrew H.,"Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2016","









  
  
    
  These headphones are wonderful. If you are looking for a closed-back headphone with good frequency response and a fair price, look no further.While these headphones can get a little tight and uncomfortable for longer listening sessions (6+ hours) due to the noise isolating ear cups, they provide great listening experiences in environments where there is some background noise. Because of the closed-back design, sound does not leak.The included cables include both 3.5mm connectors—for common devices like phones, MP3 players, and computers—and 6.35mm connectors—for use with soundboards, amps, and other high-end/professional audio equipment—to cater to your needs.The swiveling ear cups make listening with 1 or 2 ears easy, and they rest comfortably when worn around your neck. These headphones are also surprisingly portable as the ear cups fold up into the area inside the arc of the headband, and the cables disconnect from the headphones.All in all, these headphones are one of the better choices in their price range, outperforming more ""popular"" headphones like Beats by Dre, Sol Republic, and Skullcandy with ease.

  Bought these during the recent sale a few weeks ago. I have been looking at these for a few years now and finally decided to pull the trigger on them with the discount. I have no regrets with these. I have been using Sennheiser 335s for the last 4 years and have been happy with them, but they are starting to show there age so I felt it was time to retire them.The sound from the Audio-Technicas has been all I could have expected. I am very happy about that. However, the comfort is not what I expected. I have read many reviews that have praised the m50s for the way they feel on the head. My experience is not meeting the expectation. I have a large head. That was never a problem with the Sennheisers. With the ATH-m50x it is most definitely an issue and seems to be, at this point, not getting any better. Within an hour or so of wearing these I can feel increasing pressure on my head and my ears start to ache and burn. I do not regret the purchase and I hope the situation eases with more time, but at this point I am beginning to worry a bit. I guess time will tell.

  These sounded fine when I first got them a few months back. Not bad, not great- just fine. They are certainly not uncomfortable to wear but are also not the most comfortable over ear cans I own either. They land somewhere in the middle. I would generally say these headphones land squarely in the middle which is not a bad place to be for the money but also not very exciting. They get one star from me in this case though because they have died after only 3 months. They never left the studio and actually haven’t even been used more than a few times a week and they no longer work at all. I don’t know if this is indicative of their overall build quality but they certainly have not been mistreated while in my possession. My pair of Beyerdynamic DT-770 open ear cans are still going strong nearly 20 years later. Do yourself a favor, go with the Sennheiser HD-280 Pro’s over these.

    A Great set of closed back headphones, and a fine starter set for audiophiles.
  
",4.0,C. A. Todd,"Reviewed in the United States December 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  I have a lifetime of headphone use, but being a musician i quickly advanced from being okay with 'decent' sound headphones that you could get at the local superstore to not even wanting to get anything at best buy to pretty much only ordering from musical supply companies and amazon. That doesn't mean that i have lost the capacity to hear a good set of cans for the price, nor does it mean that i only would recommend the $600 cans for everyone.The ATH-M50x's are listed as studio monitors, and as studio monitors they are supposed to sound balanced - no exaggerated bass, no rolled off midrange -- it's all supposed to be there so you can make informed mixing decisions when listening. Even so, these do have a pretty impressive bass response, they don't hide anything and i prefer them sometimes when playing videogames, especially VR when i'm in a louder environment.These cans are closed back, which means they have a pretty good ability to mute outside noise though without any DSP to actively adjust to noise.  They reduce the sound of my computer when it's at full fan blast (which is really noisy, akin to a small vacuum cleaner literally) to nearly zero with these cans on.How do they treat music? Well, i listen to a wide variety of music on these as well, and find them to be quite spacious and accurate in terms of being able to tell where sounds are coming from, and they perform well regardless of how powerful the signal is going into them - no need for an external headphone amp to push them properly.Practically speaking they've got a couple good features too - these cans came with 2 cords, a shorter straight cord that works well with a cell phone or computer use, and a longer coiled one that i use in the studio. In addition, the cups swivel a full 180 degrees for dj's or matching sound from the cans to the room.A note about price - these fluctuate in price pretty regularly. The ATH-M50x are a great buy at around $130. If you're paying any more, check to see if the seller you're buying from is including the case, which is optional through most sellers. These cans have much more competition at the $150+ tier, so watching the prices is recommended.

  These headphones would be a pricey pick for middle-of-the-road quality even if they weren't a medieval torture device for the head.Sound quality - OK but should be better at this price point. Some $20-$25 monoprice headphones are just as good in this arena, without the needlessly pricey proprietary audio cable. Buy a set of fancy replacement earpads and you've got a $50 pair of headphones that knock this pricey Audio-Technica junk out of the park.Comfort - the worst. I have a normal-sized head (who doesn't?) and the smallest setting on these headphones left a LOT of space between the top of my head and the headband. Couple that with the fact that the earpads are concrete-hard and crushingly vice-like, I couldn't spend 5 minutes with these cans.

  I have the wireless headphones. They sound great wireless or plugged in! Truly the best headphones I've ever owned. However, the fact that my pc (windows and apps) fight with the bluetooth and the apps want to take control of each other when I'm using them is extremely frustrating. This is probably not a problem with the headphones, but with how they pair with my pc. So, its frustrating to not be able to use them to the full extent wirelessly.I currently have them plugged in with the wire that comes with them (fyi, you have to make sure that its pushed in all the way into the headset - I had to push harder than I thought would, and after plugging them in my pc went into a tail spin and had to be restarted).Hopefully my pc and these headphones learn how to play well together wirelessy because now that I've had a taste of wireless headphones thats all I want! :)

    Unmatched sound quality for the price!
  
",5.0,ShannonD,"Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2017","









  
  
    
  As someone who has owned countless sets of cans and really demands good sound quality out of my headphones, I have to say these are the best. I currently own the ATH-30's and although they are good, they simply don't match the ATH-M50x. I can hear so many more of the musics nuances. The bass is more clear, the definition of movies through my iPad Pro are amazing. I love the neutral reference of the headphone and that it doesn't color the sound like Beats or Sony. For a little over 100 bucks you cannot find anything comparable. Sure, they might get out matched by a set that is 3 or 4 times the price, but could you really justify paying that much for a likely dead heat in sound quality? Maybe if true monitoring in a professional studio were the case, maybe. Other than that I cannot think of a better set for the common listener.The headset is comfortable and fits nicely over my ears. The folding action of the cans is also nice. I wish the carrying bag was bigger and the fact that you must use the included cables (nope, your 1/8"" cables will not work). If you want a killer set of cans and you want the best sound quality and style does not hurt your feelings these are for you.Cheers!

  Bought these for production and casual music listening and it has surprised me with how good it is. At the price I got it for ($130) this is by far the best head set I have ever used. The sound is rather balanced with a bit of extra bass but nothing that I wouldn't consider still very useful for studio. Something to note is the detachable aux cord, which will not be compatible with just any AUX cord, due to a special locking mechanism attached to the headphone (It ships with three cords so there is no need to buy more). The only thing I would recommend is getting a carry case (around $10 for a good one) as the one they pack is a small bag and will not protect them if you put them in any sort of backpack.

However, they are incredibly well insulated so even if they are not ""noise cancelling"", they do block a lot of noise just from insulation (if you are wearing them with no sound playing, you will have difficulty hearing what the other person is saying).the sound quality is good but doesn't quite cover the full range of human hearing.

    A total upgrade to the M50x and as good as wireless headphones get
  
",5.0,B. M.,"Reviewed in the United States April 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  Somehow, they’ve actually managed to improve on the sound of the classic, reliable ATH-M50 for the wired connection. I have no clue what those claiming otherwise are talking about — a direct comparison between these and my old M50x shows a night and day improvement. The older model certainly does not sound BETTER. Unless I wore out my old headphones so much their sound was damaged, which is doubtful.As for the wireless connection, it sounds nearly as good as the wired and certainly is the best you’re going to get over Bluetooth at this point. Supports AAC and sounds great and transparent coming from an iPhone. There are no problems with connectivity, no drop-outs. And the battery life is exceptionally long; used on back-to-back long trips without recharging, with no problems. So this is great news considering travel and portability are obviously top concerns for wireless headphones.My one complaint is that they apparently can only be “attached” to one device. So for instance if I wanted to switch from my iPhone to my laptop, I can’t just click “connect” on the laptop and the headphones automatically switch; I have to first manually disconnect from the iPhone, then connect to the laptop. But this is minor and, having no prior extensive experience with bluetooth headphones, may be standard for all I know.Overall, a great purchase. Not just a supplement, but a total upgrade to and replacement for the ATH-M50x. This is now my third pair in the M50 series, following the original and then the X. I’ve had some variety of M50 for several years now, and I stick with them because they work well and sound great. I’ve heard supposedly higher end headphones, but you just can’t get a better set for the money as far as I’m concerned.

  My first pair broke down after 3 years of use. The ear pads have away but those can be replaced. The material on the headband quickly wore away from hair oils and friction. The way the headphones fold has a weak point. There is a small plastic tab that prevents the ear cup from folding outwards. If you drop your cans that is where they will fail; I dropped mine more often that I should have. Then the cops told outwards and cant clamp on your head anymore.These new models have detachable wire they come with a short, a long, and a coiled wire. The part that goes into the headphone is smaller so you would need to get the wire from the company if it breaks there. But you have three so not the worst situation to be in.The sound is phenomenal.

  I pre-ordered these headphones and was thrilled when they were shipped well before their initial release date.

The padded headband and pleather earcups are very comfortable for extended use, although they can make your ears a bit warm. The fit isn't very tight over my head, but my head isn't exactly large. From my first listening to now,I am blown away by the sound these headphones produce. I listen to everything from Tupac, to John Mayer, to Slipknot to Beethoven. For the classical music, they produce a very clear sound with good separation of instruments.for hard rock, you can hear every lyric clearly while also feeling the punch from the drums and guitars. For rap, the bass is pleasant and solid, without overwhelming the rest of the song. If you are looking for something that really pours on the bass, these are NOT for you. Get yourself the overpriced Beats ""studio"" headphones. If you are looking for comfortable, durable and very natural sounding headphones with a flat frequency response (IE STUDIO headphones) these are incredible!PS- I have used these with my 80gb Zune, my galaxy s3, and my pc and all of them powered the headphones very well. I found that the best sound was produced by my Zune, but I will be getting the FIIO X5 when it is released in the US, so I am confident that the sound will be pushed to even greater levels :)

",5.0,Cody,"Reviewed in the United States March 21, 2015","









  
  
    
  I've been using my M50xs now for over a year and am definitely in love with them. I'm not a sound/audio/music editor so I may not be the best person necessarily to compare various headphones, however, I really do love these and think they sound amazing for my personal use. It sure helps as well that they look amazing and came at a great price. After much research on my part I felt these were the absolute best option in the mid-100s price range and I do not regret my decision at all. They feel very sturdy and high quality. The cabling system works amazing and the cables themselves feel high quality as well. My only complaint, if there is one, is after several hours of use they begin to get mildly uncomfortable. However, I will not knock a star for this because for myself this just tells me it's probably time I got up and took a break from whatever I was doing. I would absolutely recommend these headphones to anyone who wants great sound quality at a great price, and can appreciate the various ranges of music or audio and doesn't just want some terribly overpriced, too-much-bass Beats.

    For the most part they are better than Sony MDR-7506
  
",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2016","









  
  
    
  I have been using the Sony MDR-7506 headphones exclusively for audio-production and entertainment for about 5 years now. I thought they were the best Headphone under $200. I waited until the ATH-M50x went on sale for $117 last Black Friday here on Amazon and to see if they live up to the hype. Well I rarely use the MDR-7506s at all any more. The M50x are just so much better. The Sonys can often pierce the ear with mids and highs, not the case with the M50x. The sound is always warm and rich even at very loud volumes making the Sonys seem flat. The Sonys are better at representing actual bass as the M50xs greatly over-emphasize it, which is perfect for entertainment but can be problematic for music production.

  Heavy duty closed back studio headphones. Excellent audio quality, very good noise blocking as they fit firmly over the ear. Great for monitoring live shows to listening to your favorite music. The odd blue color makes them look vaguely like a kids headset, so less likely to be stolen. Not a fashion statement.

  I live in Egypt and paying for a premium headphone is not easy to do because I have to pay a lot of money. I read a lot of reviews and decided to pick the m50x because I thought it's the safest choice, and I can't go wrong with them considering all the positive reviews. However, once I put them on, they were really uncomfortable, like really really uncomfortable. They gave me a headache after an hour or so, and I decided to remove them and put my cheap headphones on again. I really regret following the hype because now I can't use them without getting a headache and that's not healthy at all!

    A Bargain For a Classic Pair of Monitor Headphones
  
",5.0,J. Ordonez,"Reviewed in the United States November 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  As an audio enthusiast, I fell in love with Audio-Technica's budget friendly line of products around 10 years ago... Right before the hype was starting. I'm going to preface this and say that without a doubt, for casual and professional ""listening"" or ""general recording"" these will not disappoint whatsoever. Keeping in mind that they're slightly cut at the 200hz-300hz level and boosted at the lower frequencies, this will count the most for those looking to record. If you're a casual listener or general audio enthusiast, you can skip this next part.For monitoring audio, there is ""relatively accurate"" credibility to the claim that the ATH-M40Xs are the superior headphone. For casual listening, there is very little. There is absolute credit to be given for the 40s having a flatter response and without a doubt more neutral flavor. You can feel it in the soundstage as well - I owned a pair of M40x for 3 years and handled them roughly before they finally snapped at one of the earcup hinges (the actual plastic.) I can remember turning my head in surprise a bit more when listening to hi-Fi audio where subtle changes led to dynamic frequency shifts and would grade their ""soundstage"" at a 9/10. However, their 40mm drivers always, always, always lacked bass unless plugged into a headphone amp. Their construction is slightly less robust and they are generally less comfortable.Are there times I miss my M40xs? Absolutely. Generally the particular cut at the 300hz frequency of the M50x will eventually lead you to those pieces of audio that you wish it was more neutral in that range - and that range alone. Would I ever go back? Yes, but not over the M50x. Best analogy I could find is ordering an amasing cut of prime steak and asking it to be prepared medium. You have an amazing dinner and think ""Wow, what a great steak!"" And people yell ""You should have gotten it medium rare!!"" True ""steak aficionados"" all agree. Yet no one ordering the cut ""medium"" has any complaints. Let me give you some.ATH-M50x Bass Presence > 40xATH-M50x Natural Sound Isolation>ATH-M50x Comfort > M40xM50x's 45mm Drivers > 40mm DriversM50x Style> M40x StyleM50x Popularity/3rd Party Accessories>M40xFinally...Finally here we are. $100 for a pair of black M40x or $120 for a pair of blue/black M50x?Blue/black Audio Technica M50x all the way. The wonderful anodized blue and black paint over the hardened quality plastic is also awesome. Clamped them around the box the first night, and fall asleep with them on ever since night 2. Take them off at some point while asleep and toss em wherever. Not a scratch. Earcups get a little warm after a few hours. Hardly noticeable. Wearing them right now with no music on due to the natural sound isolation. Impedence or frequency EQ generally has me listening at 50% volume whereas the M40x I was always pushing 80% just to feel the bass a little. Great pair of natural headphones, but they're not better than the M50x's at $120

  I got these for $129.99 and as a  person who has owned numerous headphones ranging from $30 all the way to $300, nothing beats the m50x in terms of price to performance.Pros:- Arguably the best headphones for sound quality under $200 and I purchased them for $70 less than that.- Comes with a variety of audio jacks ranging from different lengths to different connections- A respectable carrying bag for them- Very portable due to having a detachable aux chord and folds up to a very manageable size- Professional AestheticCons:- The ear cuffs are terrible. I have fairly averaged size ears but they sit on the top of my ears instead of over them completely. I do know people who prefer having on-ear headphones but I am not one of them and this is advertised as an over-ear on online spec sheets. On top of that, the cuffs can be very hard for the material it's made out of. I opted to purchase aftermarket replacement ear cuffs, ones that you can conveniently find here on Amazon, and it's been a whole new experience.- It can be confusing to unfold them and put them on if you fold them up. The benefit to having modular movement is the ease of folding them up, but when unfolding them, you can easily try to bend and rotate things in the wrong way and it can get annoying.- No microphoneOverall, in my opinion, the m50x is the best pair of headphones you can get for under $200, especially if you can get them on sale.

  These sound awesome!  I have them plugged into my PC to listen to music while I am working and some games.  The sound is crisp and accurate.  The highs are well defined but don't sound tinny while the base is perfectly low but doesn't sound muddy.  To me, they sound perfect.  The bad side is while it does include 3 cables with the locking mechanism on one end they don't include a simple adapter so one can use existing cables with them.  I already have a nicer cable than they provide but it won't fit in the locking adapter port.  Found an adapter on Amazon ... for almost $50.  Are you f#$%g kidding me?  Such a simple, VERY SIMPLE, STUPID SIMPLE, thing to include yet it isn't.  -2 stars for that incredibly stupid oversight.

    Best headphone's I've ever used, bar none.
  
",5.0,Patrick Doyle,"Reviewed in the United States January 2, 2016","









  
  
    
  Here's my review after one year of using them. These headphones are the best headphones I have ever used. I don't use them for a professional duty but rather just for an everyday listening experience. For teenagers, the go to headphones are the Beats which empasize bass and nothing else. Which is great. If you listen to R&B and rap and nothing else. However, go out of that and suddenly Fleetwood Mac doesn't sound as it should. For people in my age range (teens), for the same price as Beats, I highly advise getting these headphones.The sound quality as said before is absolutely pristine, and will simply blow anyone away in this price range. Also, the build quality is very good with metals and durable plastics and cushy leather. I can wear these for hours upon hours at a time and they are still comfortable. When one slips these on, they will know they are putting on serious equipment. They also fold up quite nicely as well. On the downside, my heavy usage has made the earcups wear down after a year with the leather cracking. However, replacing the earcups is simple and costs just $20.So, for $180 or so I wouldn't hesitate to purchase these headphones - they might have been the best $200 I've ever spent.

  The ATH M50x was my favorite headphones for 5 yeas until i discovered Sennheiser, Beyerdynamic, etc. I still like these for listening to specific types of music. I was super excited when I heard that they made a wireless version of the ATH M50x, but when I received them I was very disappointed.Pros: These sound exactly the same as the original M50x in wired mode. I've seen people say that it sounds worse (?) which is completely false. The battery life is great and I'm able to them continuously for 2-3 days without charging. BT pairing is also not as bad as some people say. Oh and it comes with a built in mic, great for gamingCons: These DO NOT sound the same in wireless mode vs wired mode. Anyone who says they do cannot tell the difference. I exchanged these three times thinking that it's a defective unit but the wireless audio quality is simply inferior with reduced volume output. Wireless sound quality is still decent but versus wired mode? It's night and day,  probably because the M50x are too good. Also. there is DEFINITELY an audible hiss at all times in wireless mode. Whether you can hear it or not depends on how sensitive your ears are but some people say that there is no noise which is not true at all. Oh and the included cable is a far cry from the coiled cable that the original M50x comes with.Imo the $50 premium is only worth it if you absolutely need the portability. Else just get the wired version. The upgrade doesn't justify being able to go wireless occasionally with worse audio.

  I've used the ATH-M30x for over a year and decided I wanted to go cordless. Sadly the downside of cordless is still too great. I've run into numerious issues. First one being that the band puts lots of pressure on the top of your head causing pain after extended wearing. I did not have this problem with the M30x. The other issue  I have is battery life. I was expecting to at least be able to use the headphones while they are charging cause that only makes logical sense. Nope, these headsets are unusable while being charged... And they are not fast charging by any means. On website it's listed that you need to charge for 7 hours to get 40 hours of battery life?? They really need to put fast charging on these things and make wireless charging a thing to make charging wireless headsets more convenient.  I could get by all the downsides if I it was able to be used while charging, but you can't even do that... Overall I do not recommend wireless headsets the technology just isn't there yet. If you forget to charge headset then your pretty much going to spend entire day charging it which really sucks.

  I'm a recording artist and was in the market for a corded, durable, quality sounding, affordable, and professional studio monitor headphones. After about a week of doing reviews and comparing specifications and price ranging I went with a hunch and decided to go with the same manufacturer as my condenser microphone. I almost purchased the M40x's but when I saw the M50x came in a pearl white, badda bing. That was about 3 months ago  and at least two to three days out of the week every week for at least 16 hours on those days I am blasting these headphones either recording vocals or mixing down tracks. If anything the sound quality has gotten better. I'm actually kind of curious to see how long they hold out because I am putting them through vigorous usage. I'm very expressive when laying down my vocals and tend to throw my head around but the way these headphones are fitted to your dome they dont budge. I'm very hard of hearing so I purchased a auxiliary amplifier with them and used it for a couple days before I realized I didn't need it. My mixer pushes these babies just fine and on occasion have plug them into my phone an Android and it seems to be the same case as well. Highly recommended if you would like a pair of excellent quality Studio headphones.

  Incredibly balanced sound. Without messing with the Eq, the bass doesn't drown the sound and the treble doesn't shrill. I've been using it on a Boss BR-600 and a 2019 Sony Android TV via Avantree Bluetooth adapter. The only thing it can't do is produce the deeper bass frequencies louder (e.g. low B on a bass guitar / 31 Hz). Also, it's very choosey with what 2.5mm adapter it accepts (it needs to have a slender housing or the ones that have the speacial twist-to-lock pattern.

  These headphones are the real deal, clear crisp sound that will have you hearing new details in old music. These will work with an iPhone or similar devices with a 3.5mm jack. As other reviews have stated, I do believe these headphones have a little bit of extra bass added. However, it is in no way obnoxious, it adds just enough bass so that songs will powerful bass (e.g. ""Radioactive"" by Imagine Dragons, ""We will Rock You"" by Queen, etc.) sound better than ever, but songs with more variety, like soundtracks or other instrumental pieces, sound undistorted and beautiful. Outside nose reduction is amazing; with music playing, you will not be able to hear a conversation. I imagine that it would work very well on a subway or plane. As to construction, they seem to be solid, they are all plastic save for a metal strip in the headband; however, this is not toy store plastic but very rugged and thick plastic that will last for a long time. The materials for the earpieces and headband are comfortable, sturdy and the coverings are constructed from imitation leather. It does come with three cords, two 3.5mm jacks and a larger 6.5mm jack. You insert the cord into the headphone by inserting the mark on the cord to the left of the mark on the headphone, and then turning the cord until the marks align. Having a removable cord is nice because it prevents damage to the headphones from a cord being accidentally pulled. Because these headphones are not cheap, I suggest a quality hardcase for them. I got this one, http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LZ3VFW8?keywords=headphone%20case&qid=1452646323&ref_=sr_1_1&s=musical-instruments&sr=1-1 which fits the headphones perfectly. In short, I recommend these for any music lover of any genre, you really can't go wrong with these.

  I'm a fan of Audio Technica's headphones in general -- I own two of this model. Their audio quality is top notch for the price. You can listen to anything from music to amateur podcasts with these. There's no gimmicks like overblown bass or the tinny sounds of cheap headphones.But the ATH-M50x has a major design flaw. Without even trying you can snap back the spring-loaded hinge that holds the headphone against your hear. This hinge is the one built into the silver bit on either side that says L and R (left and right, respectively.)A quick Google search reveals many others with this problem, and just as many solutions: rubber bands, glue, 3D printed fixes, etc. While I haven't gone quite as far as 3D printing anything, none of the simpler solutions work terribly well to fix the hinge once it's been over-extended. It's a shame because these headphones are otherwise built to last with many of the parts including the wire and the pads easily replaceable once they're worn out or lost.So I'm giving the ATH-M50x a three out of five stars simply because the poorly designed hinge component doesn't live up to the quality I'd expect from Audio Technica.

    Good headphones, BUT NOT FOR CASUAL/FUN LISTENING.
  
",4.0,Avery G,"Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2017","This is going to be a long review, so try to hang in there and read to the end, I promise it's worth it!

Alright, so chances are, you're looking at buying the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x most likely because of one of three reasons: A friend that has never listened to genuinely good headphones before is telling you that these are way better than Beats by Dre, A YouTuber told you that these are way better than Beats by Dre and most other consumer grade headphones, or because you need a pair of headphones for audio monitoring. I'd say almost 90% of people aren't buying the M50x for that last reason, which is the main problem here. Not so much the headphones themselves, but the reason people are buying them.

Countless amounts of people spend the majority of their lives listening to music with headphones and earbuds that are either cheap, tinny sounding trash or overpriced, consumer-grade ""fashion cans"" with overpowering bass. So it's only natural that when you go from something like that to something like the M50x which has waaaay more detail and clarity, you're going to think they're the bee's knees and that they knock everything else on the shelf at your local electronics store out of the ballpark. And for the most part, that's very true. The M50x have been regarded by many as the ""Beats killers."" And this is also true, they have better sound quality than even the most expensive Beats headphones, for around half the price. These headphones get compared to Beats quite a lot, if you haven't already figured it out.

BUT. There is unnecessary hype surrounding these headphones that has been built up by various people on YouTube who recommend these headphones for everyday use and gaming.

So here's the deal, I don't dislike the M50x. I respect the M50x for their original, intended purpose: audio monitoring. If you don't know what monitoring is, in simple terms, it is listening to audio recordings and analyzing them. In order to effectively do this, you need a pair of monitor headphones or monitor speakers that playback music with as much detail as possible.

So while these are indeed very good headphones for monitoring, they have several very important flaws that make them impractical for casual listening. I'm going to break things down into 3 main categories: Build, Comfort and Sound.

BUILD:

Build quality on the M50x is, for the most part, no issue here. The plastic feels sturdy and fairly thick, and the headband is metal, leading to an overall robust-feeling headphone that won't break unless you really try to. They fold up and the ear cups flip all the way backwards, so portability is very good. They also have a detachable cable which is great for portability. The fake leather on the headband and ear pads feel soft, but a bit cheap. Nothing deal-breaking for the price, in my opinion. But later on, the corners cut on the quality of the fake leather will bite you in the back when the pads and/or headband start flaking. The pads can be easily replaced, however. Overall, solid build quality but nothing amazing.

COMFORT:

If you're anything like me and most audiophiles, you'll refuse to wear a pair of headphones that bother or hurt your ears, no matter how good the sound quality is. The M50x aren't super uncomfortable, but they're nothing close to being the absolute most comfortable. Anyone who says the M50x are ""super-comfy"" have probably been wearing concrete on their ears until they bought these. For a lot of people, the main reason these are uncomfortable are the cheap, poorly made ear pads. As mentioned in the build quality, they're made of a fake leather, which isn't a big deal. But the padding inside of them is, in my opinion, unacceptable. It's a cheap foam that has very little density to it. The second reason, which can fortunately be fixed for the most part, is the clamping force these have on your ears. When I first used these, the clamp wasn't terrible, but after 30 minutes of listening my ears starting hurting, also due to the bad ear pads. You should be able to fix this by stretching them across the box they came in and letting them sit there overnight, maybe a bit longer. This helped enough to relieve the clamp a fair amount for me.

Comfort can be improved a ton by buying different ear pads. However, doing this will affect sound quality, usually for the worst. More on that in the sound section. Overall they aren't exactly comfortable, but these headphones shouldn't be used for long listening sessions anyways. Which leads us to....

SOUND:

How to describe the sound in simple terms? Clear, detailed, accurate. But also harsh, fatiguing, and narrow. Do these sound better than all Beats by Dre headphones, yes. Not by an unbelievable amount, though. You won't have a life-changing experience just from switching to the M50x if a pair of Beats Studio or Solo were your previous ""best"" listening experience. Bass is cleaner and less emphasized, which to extreme bass-heads (People who absolutely crave bass in headphones) may be disappointing. But this doesn't mean the bass is bad. Bass does get deep, but it can be a bit ""muddy"" at times, meaning that it isn't very tight-feeling (I know, these terms might not make much sense! Google them up, you might find a much better explanation than what I can give).

Mid-range frequencies (Think vocals and string instruments as well as most wind instruments) are there and can be heard fine, but aren't exactly up at the front of the stage like the bass and highs are. You might have even heard someone already say that the M50x have a recessed mid-range, and this is true.

Now the high-end frequencies (Think high-pitched, sibilant vocals and instruments like flutes and cymbals, as well as higher-pitched chords from acoustic guitars). This is where the M50x stop being a casual-listening or ""fun"" headphone. The highs are upfront and detailed, which can be good for the purpose of monitoring, but they're so heavily emphasized that it makes listening at high volumes uncomfortable and fatiguing. Some people like for headphones to have this even when casually listening, but the majority of people will eventually find it uncomfortable and not very relaxing.

Finally the soundstage and imaging (Soundstage: how big the area of the audio sounds. If every sound seems like it's very close to your head and not further away, that's narrow soundstage. If it sounds like you're in a big room or a theater, that's wide soundstage. Imaging: how accurate the placement of sounds are within the soundstage. If you feel like you can hear almost exactly where that sound is coming from, that's great imaging.) Soundstage is almost non-existant. It exists, but it's pretty narrow. Everything sounds right up against your head. However, the imaging is decent. I could usually tell pretty accurately what direction sounds are coming from.

So the sound of the M50x is where the fun, casual listening experience gets cut short. Yes, they are very detailed. Yes, the clarity is exceptional. But the highs and sometimes muddy bass, especially the highs, can make relaxed listening very difficult.

It boils down to this: The build quality of the M50x is good and they're very portable, but the comfort falls short of other similarly-priced (and even lower priced) headphones and the sound quality is not suitable for listening to music for pure enjoyment. Audio-Technica themselves, for some reason, claim ""casual listening"" as a selling point for this headphone compared to the other headphones in the M-series, which is silly and goes to show that they're trying to profit from all the unnecessary hype about these headphones. Shun me if you want, but if you do some more research about these, it's blatantly obvious. But once again, like I said, I respect these headphones and they ARE good, just not for the reason people are led to believe.

ALTERNATIVES:

If you truly want a pair of good, portable pair (most are portable) headphones meant for causal, fun, enjoyable listening, then check out these headphones I've either personally used or have owned myself. There are more out there than these, but here is a short list to get you started. Happy researching!

SONY MDR-1A: Great headphones for portable, everyday use. Build quality is excellent, comfort is on-point and they sound warm and relaxing, but definitely not dull or boring. They do however, cost a little bit more than the M50x, nowadays around $200 brand new. The price jump is worth it though.

Bose Soundtrue AE2: Good portable headphones, comfort is outstanding, they're lightweight and are easy to forget about when you wear them. Build quality is good and sound is relaxed but can still be fun when the volume is cranked up! As of this review, they are on sale for $100 on Amazon. You can find a used pair for even less. Not on sale they're $180 which is a bit pricey but still in my opinion, worth it.

Beyerdynamic DT770 32ohm: An overall great pair of headphones for both casual listening and even professional use. Build quality and comfort are on-point, and sound quality is like the M50x, but honestly, better. However, the cable isn't detachable and they don't fold up, so they aren't exactly portable. These can be found for around $200, sometimes less. Definitely less if you buy them used.

Status Audio CB-1: These are basically half the price of the M50x, but have more enjoyable sound (plenty of bass!), and are more comfortable. Build quality is questionable, though, so don't be rough with them. And if you have a very large head, they may not fit snug on your head because of light clamping force.

B&O PLAY H6: These are more expensive than the M50x, especially the 2nd generation which start at around $240, but the build is great, they're very comfortable, look fantastic, and have a clear, warm, inviting sound that's fun to listen to.

Philips SHP9500: Right now, these only cost around $60 or less, and they're fantastic. Build is good, comfort is fantastic and the sound is spacious and wonderfully pleasant. However, these are OPEN-BACK headphones, which means that sound will leak. If you're listening at normal or loud volumes especially, other people around you will hear your music. But if this isn't a concern or you're going to be using your headphones mostly at home, definitely go ahead and get these.

Audio-Technica M40x: This is the little-brother of the M50x that nobody cares about for some reason, even though they're way better suited for casual or fun listening. Build is good like the M50x, comfort is pretty much the same, but changing the pads to something like the Brainwavz HM5 angled leather pads would make them excellent, and doesn't negatively affect the sound (pads other than these may affect the sound). Sound is more neutral than the M50x, the bass and highs aren't emphasized, but they're still great. Also they cost only $100!

HIFIMAN Edition S: A comfortable, well-built portable headphone that sounds great, and actually has the ability to switch between being open-back and closed-back (open-backed headphones usually sound better!). Also on sale for $130 right now, a great deal!

    Solid headphones, Strange Bluetooth
  
",3.0,JonaKim,"Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  The comfort and quality for these headphones are amazing. I've tried a couple of over the ear headphones and this one is the most comfortable for medium sized ears. I'm no audiophile but the quality is as good as many of the reviews make it out to be and compared to the microsoft surface headphones, they are noticeably better. The one main issue I have with these headphones is its bluetooth feature. Usually, once my bluetooth speakers or earbuds connect to my pc, I can play from any source at the same time or switch between the sources without the secondary source being muted. These headphones however do that. If i were to play a game such as League of Legends and watch a youtube video while in loading screen and swap back, all my audio for the game is muted. The only way I can get the audio back is by restarting the game. Another example is if I'm editing music on Fl Studio 20 and then play a youtube video, the youtube video is now permanently muted until I close out of Fl Studio. I never had this issue if I'm connected to my pc via the wire provided in the package, but I primarily purchased these over the older m50x because of the bluetooth feature. It's very frustrating to constantly be cautious about what I play because I can potentially mute an application entirely. I attempted to update the firmware but my firmware update always fails to go through. I follow all the steps that the Audio Technica app gives me to the T and I still cannot seem to successfully update the firmware. This is really disappointing that the bluetooth on this headphone sucks because of how amazing the sound quality and comfort is. The sheer amount of inconveniences I go through and the amount of changes I had to make on my everyday workflow in order to work around this bluetooth issue is very annoying. The only reason I have yet to return them is because of how amazing they are, besides the bluetooth. Please fix it or if it has been fixed with the firmware update, fix the app because the app is the only way to update its firmware. I've checked on many online forums on how to update the firmware and the app seems to be the only solution. If this one issue is fixed, I'd say this is the best bang for your buck wireless studio headphones on the market

  Short: I think at this price point, you cannot go wrong (For Gaming, studio, or personal). If you set yourself up with things like a physical EQ that plugs in to your computer, with some very much needed headband cushions +velcro, you're good to go.In terms of sound quality, if youre on a desktop, it should be a sin to not have some sort of EQ or amp or whatever. If youre doing something more simple like listening through your phone, I dont think i have much to complain about.My sorrow mostly is in terms of comfort, as my scalp now feels like its lost blood circulation and every time I try to put them back on its like im getting blown out of an airlock. Buy yourself some ""headband cushions"" along with these with some velcro and you'll be set. Do not forget about an EQ if you want some decent bass and things of that nature, as that is one thing I very happy about, as these can punch some great kicks in songs.The quality is great, packaging, and other toys provided are also great, be careful with the wires though, they sort of last as long as the apple ones do and the earmuffs may need to be replaces every 2 years or so. They also look great!

  The sound quality of these headphones is astonishing. I've spent the last few years buying 50 dollar headphones and never really found any I was happy with long term. These headphones change everything, and I am so happy I coughed up the extra dough to buy these.Pros:Sound good on a phone:These headphone are the first full size cans I've owned that actually sound excellent when played through something like a phone. With previous cans I always craved more bass when playing through my phone, and smaller earphones were the only ones sensitive enough to provide that. But these cans solve the problem in two ways: 1. Detailed, accurate sound makes everything sound clean and wonderful including the bass allowing me to run these at much lower volume and be completely satisfied. 2. These have very high sensitivity allowing them to produce the same perceived volume as earphones when set to the same setting on my phone.Another benefit of these cans is they are tuned perfectly (to my tastes) for music listening, which means EQ adjustments are not needed. The bass and treble are boosted just enough for music listening while still maintaining a very balanced sound across the board. This is in contrast to some cans which may provide a very flat even sound across the frequency range, but the lack of bass and treble make EQ adjustments necessary for the best music listening enjoyment. Since I plan to use these with all my devices including some which have very limited/zero EQ options, this is a huge plus for me.Very good build quality:The pictures do not do these cans justice, very high quality feel to them with a little bit of heft to them. These cans feel very solid and I am confident they will last. I love the low key understated design, not flashy and no glossy surfaces. I was worried that the use of plastic would make these feel cheap, but that is not the case at all.Very comfortable:The articulation on the ear cups on these is perfect, the tightness of the headband is just enough to provide great sound isolation without being uncomfortable.Cons:Would have liked to seen standard 3.5 jacks on the headphone, unfortunately it looks like you will be stuck using the cables included with the headphones as these are not compatible with standard 3.5 male to male cables. With that said, having 3 cable options included is awesome and they feel like durable cables (time will tell).Overall I am thrilled with these headphones and recommend them to anyone looking at full size cans. If you can't afford these now, it is worth the wait to save up and buy these, as these sound SO much better than cheaper cans and I suspect they will last much longer too.

  Great sound quality and amazing battery life. I have a 2 hour round trip commute everyday and I have only charged it after 2 weeks of use and even then it wasn't low on battery.I will say the Bluetooth is a little odd in the sense that when it's not playing music it will go into like a sleep mode where it'll take a second for the sound to kick back on when you start playing something from your phone. And sometimes it doesn't kick back on when you're going through something like Instagram where a lot of short videos with sound are starting and stopping as you scroll. And it gets confused sometime when switching from one app playing sound to another. Annoying quirk from expensive headphones but the for the sole purpose of listening to music it serves its purpose well.Though it is good to note that there is absolutely no noise cancelling, you'll hear everything unless you turn your music up loud. If you're bothered by ambient noise on the train then these aren't for you most likely.

  Before I comment, I want to mention that these headphones are pretty good for people who prefer clarity over bass. If you're expecting these headphones to have decent bass, you'll be disappointed. I returned these simply because I felt they did not have enough bass at all. The music I listened to felt like it needed something. It didn't make much of a difference to the songs I listened to compared to other headphones. It's very comfortable though. Not sure why people are complaining about the comfort. They all must have insanely large heads because these are the most comfortable pair of headphones I've ever owned. They feel like a pillow is resting on my head.So other than that, these headphones are pretty good for the price. But if you're expecting bass, look elsewhere.

  Based on 5 days of using these, this was one of the best purchases I have made in years.Music is just clearer. I'm noticing things in songs I've listened to for years that I didn't hear before. My ears have been getting a steady stream of Pink Floyd, Aphex Twin, Miles Davis, and Radiohead, and I feel more immersed in the music than ever before.They are great for video gaming too. My friends on call of duty say its much easier to hear me, and I can say the same for their voice and the sounds of the game.The ability of these to instantly switch between a wired connection and Bluetooth wireless is another huge plus for these. They have a play/pause, and volume buttons on the unit for convenience, but they are sleek and not obvious, keeping the clean no-frills aesthetic that AT is known for.5 stars, will be recommending to anyone with ears.

  I bought these because I needed an upgrade to my previous studio headphones.  I wanted to spend a bit, but not too much without sacrificing quality.  Read reviews on multiple pairs of different brands, and when i found these i ordered them immediately.  The sound quality is great, and they are incredibly comfortable.  I took them on deployment with me and they did a great job for my mobile studio.  If you're looking for some good studio headphones that cost less than most big name brands, look no further.

  I loved my first pair so much I had to buy a second for home use. They're great quality, feel nice, I can wear them for extended amounts of time. They have some low frequency response that is great for listening to music and playing games. These aren't studio reference headphones, but I do use them to mix/master music and it's close enough to what I need (as I'm not in the recording studio world, just live audio).If you want to hear clean audio, these are your headphones. They're not noise cancelling (but with enough volume on anything, it's possible) but that's not a huge issue for me personally.

  Received my refurbished ATH-M50x in excellent condition with all cables and papers.  Everything looks to be in brand new condition.As for the sound, it does get a little bass heavy with newer music.  But, it is really good for music that does not have much bass.  Here is my take with the ATH-M50x and the ATH-M40x (yes, I own this too).The ATH-M50x sounds more musical with the highs being crisp and more present.  The lows have a kick with the sub bass, and this sounds good with music that lacks bass.  Music with bass may become slightly enhanced.  The mid range is present with no distortion.  It's like sitting in a small jazz club, very intimate with making the music fuller and alive.  I think most will want this sound as compared to the ATH-M40x.The ATH-M40x sounds much more flat and may be better suited for audio monitoring.  The mid range is slightly more up front.  The bass and highs are very present and detailed, with no distortion.  You can listen to this for hours as the sound is not driving.  It's like sitting in an concert theater at about the 15th row.  Very enjoyable!  People that do not care for too much low bass will love this cans.Very happy to get the refurbished ATH-M50x here, as I was tired of playing the EBay auction for used cans (where some looked quite used).  Both of my ATH-M40x adn ATH-M50x are keepers.  Including my Grado SR60...

  These headphones are great for the home studio, plugged directly into your audio interface or mixer, for monitoring your sound creations,  also for the price. I have not used the Bluetooth yet  I have had Beats, they are good. But these are great once you get used to the audio range.

    Changed The Game!!!
  
",5.0,Bruce George Jr.,"Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  Decided to take a risk. I own [including this pair], 4 headphones.  One is  a standard BOSE Ae2 that I had for over 7 years [still works like a charm] and I use those for the gym. Next is another pair of BOSE that replaced the Ae2's and they are known as Sound True. I use those interchangeably (gym and for work). Then I decided to step up to the noise cancelling wireless headphones and went with Sennheiser. BT 4.50 noise cancelling  At the time I got my Sennheiser headphones,  BOSE was dropping in the QC department and at that point, I refused to pay what they were asking. And their new products have the entire alexa nonsense and that is not the point of having headphones if you are really an audiophile.  So, in the case of the Sennheiser headphones,  it did the job sound wise. I have certain tracks that I use as a litmus test those tracks passed. As for the wireless feature- just like any wireless product,  it is going to be spotty or laggy pending what  you are around. That feature I did not care for too much. If I am sitting and utilizing the wireless feature,  solid no issues of course.  The issue I ran into the Sennheiser's was more of a comfort thing. The ear cups does  not fully cover my ears and it became uncomfortable after so many hours. I will say I had them for a year and a couple months. Every now and then I would do some research to see what is out there in the audio world. I WOULD NEVER purchase Beats, Sony, Jabra, BOSE or any major brand at this point because the risk is too high. So. in the case of the brand Audio Technica, I knew of them since many professional musicians  or dj's would utilize this particular brand. Did some digging on the product and took a chance.  They came in today and they do have a wireless feature, but that is not a priority for me- more of an afterthought at this point. The headphones are extremely comfortable and super light. The sound quality is astronomical and the headphones provided a different musical effect for me. I was able to listen to various tracks of different genres for a good minute to see the capabilities of what the headphones can do. MAN! As an audiophile,  I am a happy camper 💪🏾! This will be the only brand I would purchase for now on. Anyone who is an audiophile  will not be disappointed at ALL.

  Okay. If you're a audiophile like me, but do not have the money to spend ludicrous amounts of it for headphones... These are the headphones for you. BUT, with that being said, do not think the price compromises the quality of these headphones. The clarity of these headphones is perfect for mixing music or just relaxing at home jamming.I read plenty of reviews before purchasing these and I read that they were lacking presence in the low end, but I have to disagree. If you truly enjoy music in it's entirety (highs, mids, and lows) these will give you that and won't drown everything else with head thumping bass. The lows are there and it does offer some good thumping, but just not over exaggerated like Beats. Honestly, these headphones are like having studio monitors on your ears so if that doesn't say anything than I don't know what will. Just trust me and the thousands of other reviews on here.

  If you are a fan of the Audio Technica  ath-m50x wired version of these headphones, you will appreciate the sound from these as they are pretty much identical except for having Bluetooth.Pros: Can attach a wire with a mic and use like a regular headset or as a backup if the battery goes out, which is very useful. Solid build, Classic sound with deep bass and performance at a reasonable price. (I got it on sale). Battery life is excellent as it will last for days with moderate use.Cons: Bluetooth connection was sometimes finicky. Had to use switch twice to get it to respond at times. Same thing for the ""touch"" control feature on the ear cup, feedback was hard to tell if you pressed it properly. Slight static popping and ear pressure feels heavier than wired version (I have both).  Hence, it was somewhat fatiguing for long term use. You can use a mic built in instead of the wired one, but the sound quality drops a lot and in a noisy room your caller will have a hard time hearing you.Although it seems like more cons than pros, I think this is a good buy (especially if you prefer over the ear vs. ear buds) but not perfect.

  I can't say anything bad about these headphones. The sound from them is superb. They are a closed-ear design and the ear cups make a good seal around your ears, creating an excellent basis for sound. In a normal situation, there is no need for noise cancellation. The sound isolation is so good, I can hear myself breathing or even the beating of my heart or movements of neck joints - these are all internal conductive sounds you would not normally be able to hear unless your ears were totally isolated from the outside world.Frequency response is excellent for all ranges. Everything I've listened to with any other headphones pales in comparison to these. It's like listening to everything you have ever heard anew.

    Bluetooth connectivity to Mac was surprisingly seamless
  
",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2019","









  
  
    
  I initially had a pair of Beats Studio headphones that broke on the right side of the headband. And while I'm not on the hate train that some audiophiles tend to be towards them, I can't justify paying $350 even with the sale price that I initially bought them for. However, if there's anything that makes them remotely worth their price point, is the technology of their connectivity: I get that they use proprietary software but I've never ran into any issues of interference that most other bluetooth headphones run into. So finding headphones that connect to my Mac relatively well is important to me. These do that for the most part.For starters, you don't have to get into any pairing mode, just flick the switch on and have bluetooth enabled on your mac and it should recognize and connect to it. The only latency issue I've encountered is that the audio doesn't immediately start to play from the start of a video or even when manually starting a track on iTunes. But otherwise, the audio is in sync. I don't run into any major interference (I once tried these bluetooth Skullcandy headphones and just turning on the faucet would cause the sound to cut in and out). Can't really speak on the range but I do feel like I got a slightly better range/distance with the Beats Studio. The battery life is pretty good for bluetooth headphones but not quite as good as the Beats were (if you kept the ANC off) and while it doesn't have any real noise cancellation, it does seal off outside noises pretty damn well. In fact, if it did come with ANC, I'm pretty sure the outside sounds would be 100% cancelled.The sound quality on bluetooth sounds pretty similar to being wired. I never owned a pair of the normal M50Xs but from what I've seen/read in reviews, it sounds virtually the same. The only major negative I have with the bluetooth is that it doesn't like when you switch from one sound source/app to another: for example, if you are playing something in iTunes and then try to play a youtube video from your web browser immediately after, it will mute all sounds from your web browser and you'll have to cancel one or even both to get it to play sound again.  Otherwise the bluetooth connectivity and sound are really good (although, I personally prefer a cleaner, flat sound profile).

  Learning to love my favorite music all over again with these, after years of earbuds and stock car stereo. Crisp, precise, undistorted sound. Bass volume is inadequate without an amp, but that's to be expected with large drivers. These would be excellent with a DAC/amp.The free downloadable headphone amp/equalizer apps work surprisingly well to boost the bass volume even over the bluetooth attachment, though at a loss of max total volume, which is too loud for me anyways. There is a barely noticeable loss of sound quality over bluetooth, but it isn't bad at all.Love the simple sheet metal band wrapped in soft material- easy to adjust the amount of pressure they put on your head by and find what's the most comfortable. Just gently bend it with your fingers so it makes a wider arc.

  Solid pair of phones. Epic battery life. When I first got these I charged them fully once and didnt have to charge them again until 6 days later and i used them pretty heavily each day and it still had juice to keep going. I did notice when the battery was really low the volume drops off slightly and BT connectivity begins to degrade slightly also. Wish it performed just a little bit better with sound quality and loudness. Feels like i want to turn it up 2 or 3 more notches and can sound a bit rough without a customizable eq. Bass is pretty decent and clean however my ear wants it to be just a little louder than the maxed out setting on some tracks. All that said, battery life alone make these a sweet setup and the aesthetic aint bad neither.

But, these are everything I need them to be. I don't play my music at skull rattling volume. I like it loud enough to clearly hear the texture of the music. I like balanced and clear bass, mids, and highs. I get this with these headphones. I can turn music up reasonably loud, and just enjoy it. Note, if you test headphones with youtube or something like pandora, that's not an extremely high fidelity source. Usually, playing a CD would be better. In particular, most streaming music is missing much of the high frequency range. So, if you cannot clearly hear cymbals, chimes, and snare drums, or the overtones of a performance on a harp or violin, maybe the source isn't giving you that sound, even if the headphones can do so. Note that these headphones, as designed, have an accentuated bass response. Some people call it punchy. Some people like that. Also, the factory earpads are not the most comfortable. They are OK but not great. Therefore, I'm using Brainwavz Replacement Memory Foam Earpads for Large Over the Ear Headphones. Those work fine, and are very comfortable. They also change the sound response slightly, reducing the bass just a bit. So, for me, it's more balanced and transparent, which is how I like it. One more thing, these have closed backs and are over the ear. So, they have some natural passive (not active) noise prevention. That works great in a quiet room. I plan to try it on an airplane, but have not done so yet. Other commenters say that works. So, overall, I really like these headphones and strongly recommend them. Ron

  I'm a musician and do home recording and thought it was about time to replace my many years old Sony MDR-V6 phones.I never paid this much for cans but I must say they are worth every penny.First, I listened to a Kat Edmonson album which are not over produced and meticulously engineered. It was like hearing them for the first time! I was very impressed.Then, I did a piano track to an original composition I'd been working on. These phones will definitely the recording pricess.I had them on for about an hour and found them to be light and comfortable, maybe more so than the old Sonys. I was shocked that they fit my head right OOTB...no adjustment required. Of course all heads and ears are different so YMMV.I also like the way the cable is detachable and those additional cables included are a nice touch.I got these for recording purposes and will not use them for mobile applications. I think eer buds are a better choice for that.

    DURABLE. Purchase October 2014. Still going strong.

  I am totally amazed at how old these are. Beyond the cosmetic changes, they feel, look and sound like I only bought them last year. It is hard to describe what a good product this is. It is clearly durable. My daily workhorse, I use these headphones every day from sun-up to sun-down (except when I am at the gym). They come with a leather storage bag, but I never use that thing. Each day these get rolled up and chucked into my carry bag on my way home from the office. And it stays there until the next morning when they re-emerge for a new day. There is something lovely about a pair of phones which have been sat on, banged up, thrown around, treated with complete abandon, and yet, keep going with little evidence of that damage. This alone makes it something worth looking at.But then the sound quality is top notch. It is not as bass heavy as the Beats headsets, but it is far more versatile. It easily does a good job of most genres (jazz, hip hop, R&B, house are some of my favourites). They are great for the office because the sound leakage is limited. At the prices you get these for, I doubt that you can get anything better.Check out these pictures. You can see that the headphones have aged. But they do the job, and I still love them. These are my first Audit-Technica purchases of any sort, but they've found a life long customer (and fan) in me. This level of engineering quality (and at these prices) is almost impossible to find these days. Did I say fan? No, a STAN!06 Januray 2020: See updated pictures over 5 years later! The faux leather is completely worn but the cushion is still soft and does a decent job of isolating the noise. The sound is good as ever. I use these everyday and they work like they did on the first day. Buy these immediately!

    Left Cup Louder than the Right
  
",3.0,David Kramer,"Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  These headphones are amazing, they have great definition and bass but the one gripe I have about these is the imbalance in volume between the two sides, it's the smallest difference, most noticeable when the output is turned down very low. The left ear cup is slightly louder than the right, I produce music and was attracted to these headphones because of that. This issue is detrimental when it comes to layering instruments and vocals, no matter what software you use. Overall I love and recommend these headphones but wish there was more consistency and I didn't have to send them back, deal with amazons system, and wait a week before going back to my creative work.

  These babies look great!I would only say that these are not what I expected for the cost I paid for them.

Sound isn't impressive though btw. Now also take note that I just used my smartphone (S10 with high quality pandora music) which isn't exactly a way to get the best sound out of your phone.Anyway, for anyone wanting gym headphones those, bose ones though, are bad ass 😁. Definitely worth the extra bill.

  These are great quality and  deliver great sound at a great price.  They feel very high end. I would give it five stars but they do get uncomfortable after awhile. It is as if the cups are not deep enough. I can feel the the driver pushing on my ears. The part that is very frustrating is I have used these for about a week everyday thinking I’d get used to it but it has had an unexpected effect.  My left ear feels like it’s being folded or has pressure on it even when I’m not wearing the earphones.  I feel it all day long.  So I may be returning these and hoping that sensation wears off. I hate feeling like returning them because  they are so nice, but that sensation concerns me especially if it doesn’t go away.

  Maybe it’s from spending a lot of time listening to my Sennheisers, but these sounded very “hot”.  Particularly from cymbals & other higher-pitched instruments.  Way better when listening to older recordings (read: 60s & 70s), and I suspect that given decent EQ control might really helpful.  This is from listening to them on Day 1 - I’m guessing that a few weeks of break-in might also improve things.  -1 star for the sweat-inducing vinyl ear pads!

  Don't get me wrong, they sound great. Audio quality is very good in my humble opinion. Easy to use and the cushions are fantastically soft.The issue I have with them is I found them on a list of ""headphones good for large ears"". They are not. I have both large ears and my ears poke almost straight off the side of my head. The pads are not large enough to be over ear headphones for someone resembling a chimpanzee like me. While the cushion is soft, it still hurts my ears after about an hour of use.I'm sure these are fantastic for most costumers, but not for the large eared variety of headphone users.

  Moving from my ATH-M50x to this mostly for BT and battery life. The sound is just as good to my ear, the battery is tremendous, and it's nearly perfect.The two drawbacks with this headset is the new connector, it's not as secure as the old ATH-M50x connector and the only included cable is really short. This is fine if you have a DAC or extender with a longer cable but it's annoying to pick this up and not receive the same wonderful assortment of cables that came with the ATH-M50x.The other drawback is the stock ear cups, they are something that you would want to look at changing out as the stock ones are shallow. All in all I'm quite happy, just little complaints that I hope they consider when making a future revision.

  I bought these headphones as a replacement pair. I must say that I do love these headphones. They come with 3 different cords which you can connect to the headphones. I use the coil-cord with them due to being in broadcasting/recording. They have a very deep, rich sound with good highs and nice bass. One of the things that I do like most about them is they fit very snugly over your ears to prevent feed back from the microphone. The color that I picked (The dark green with the brown headband) really is a nice looking pair of headphones. They do come, like I said with 3 different cords and also a carry bag. The cord disconnects from them and the headphones do fold up so you can carry them in the bag. I would totally recommend these headphones not only for the looks, but for the great sound they produce.

  I've had all kinds of headsets ranging from $20 to $300.  Sound, clarity, and value is what I care about the most. Brand and who is paid to promote them has no effect on my evaluation.The higher price products I expect better quality.  I don't recommend sets in the $20 to $30 priced range as I've never found anything decent.  They're just horrible all categories.  Price might seem good but you're going to be buying replacements when they stop working which will add up.  Sets that's $50 and up are so much better.This audio tech set that's $179.00 should cost around $60 to $90. It's a total a rip off in the current price range.  Because of the price I would not recommend them to anyone.It's like chevy trying to price a fully loading 4dr impala to the 4dr BMW M5 sedan. I like both cars but would never recommend the impala if the price was the same as the M5.Pass on audio tech and get something in the $60 to $90 where those sets are of the same quality or stay in the same price range and get something better.Don't listen to those YouTubers and streamers that are paid to promote audio tech.  If another brand paid them more they'd switch will tell you to buy that. Some will purposely show off the name brand of what they use instead of saying it. Visual promotions.

  The overall sound quality and sound stage are good.  The highs and mids have solid presentation.  The lows are just not there.  The passive noise-cancellation is very good with a circumaural ear cup.The physical comfort is top-notch.  You can wear these comfortably for a few hours almost forgetting they are there.Overall these are decent headphones for a clear, crisp sound and solid comfort.  Using them for gaming and music really helps demonstrate a good product and sound field.For comparison, I was a big fan of a classic, solid competitor (MDR) product for years.  Those had a more balanced overall sound presentation of highs, mids and lows when compared to the ATH-M50X.  I have also tried the most popular (synonym for “pound”) product.  It had great lows but lacked the solid mids and highs when compared to this product.

",4.0,Timothy Phan,"Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2017","









  
  
    
  While these are a great starting semi-budget pair for those getting into the headphones enthusiast world, they do have a bit of a V-shaped sound signature (lows and highs are raised) and the sound stage is very narrow (sounds centered in head). Compared to the M50, the pads on the M50x are great and the detachable/swappable cables add on a lot of versatility, but the pads are all pleather so some people might have comfort issues from heat or clamping depending on size and shape of head. I highly recommend the Brainwavz Hybrid Memory Foam Earpads mod as it widens the soundstage, neutralizes the sound signature, and makes the headphones really comfortable; the only reason why I gave it 4 stars is because it needs this mod.

  I am absolutely wild about the M50 series of headphones, and the M50x did not disappoint. I have also owned the M50, so I can offer an intelligent comparison between the two. As far as I can tell, the M50x uses the same well-respected and critically-acclaimed audio system. Audio Technica certainly has not changed what has been working well for them.However, they have made improvements with the M50x. The cushions are softer, so they are more comfortable and can be worn for long periods. I got a headache after wearing the M50 all day at work, but I have no issues with the M50x. The M50x also comes with a detachable audio wire, which is really great. The product comes with three wires, and I've spread them out. I leave one at work and two are connected at home, so I just have to carry the headphones around. It's easy to insert the wire: just install and twist 10 degrees to connect it, and the opposite procedure to remove. Overall, I really like them. Would buy again.

",5.0,Michael,"Reviewed in the United States May 7, 2015","









  
  
    
  There really isn't a lot that I can say about the ATH-M50X that most others haven't already said. These headphones blew my mind with the fact that they sound as good, if not better than my Sennheiser HD 558's. I'm amazed by the fact that a pair of closed back headphones can be on par with massive, open back headphones. They have the highs and mids you expect from a pair of open back headphones while having all the perks of closed back headphones. There's good bass that isn't too heavy but still has a bit of a kick to it, while the highs and mids are crystal clear, I really never expected such clarity from closed back headphones. The fact that they sound as good as my HD 558's, while leaking little to no sound is the point that really wins me over and convinces me to say that these might be my new favorite pair of headphones. The only downside I found in them, after listening to music and podcasts with them for about 8 or 9 hours straight, is that the ear pads are a little thin, or they clamp down a little too hard on my head which does cause some discomfort. But then again, not many headphones are still comfortable after the 6th or 7th hour of use. I found that many people actually snag a pair of Brainwavz Replacement Memory Foam Earpads to remedy this, which I have done, so I hope that might remedy this minuscule issue. But over all, absolutely worth the money, I don't think I'll ever buy any other closed back headphones, I'll just stick with the ATH-M50X's for a good long while.

  3 months use so far. Purchased for $129.Usage:I use these headphones for everything. Gaming, movies, studying, and anything else you can think of. In all regards, the headphones perform well what you would expect from it's price tag.Comfort:There is never any discomfort on the top of my head no matter the duration these headphones are used, but I'd advise anyone to remove them for a few minutes after a couple hours if possible. In my case, I'd say my head is on the larger side and extended use never bothers me.I advise anyone with a medium to large size ears to purchase alternative ear pads, with the latter being absolutely necessary. If your ears are the medium size, order these and feel them out. If your ears are larger, I heavily advise you add alternative ear pads on your order (adding an approximate $20 to this particular purchase).Continuing, Ear discomfort was the only discomfort I noticed. However, the average user will be very happy with these headphones and would be surprised as to how long they can wear them.Sound:Extremely clear and balanced. If the music you're listening to has good bass, you'll hear it. If it has good treble, you'll hear it.Extra value:These headphones come with 3 separate cables. Short, long, and coiled. They also come with a travel bag just the right size to hold the headphones and a cable.To conclude, the sound, comfort, and extra value in the purchase makes it well worth the price tag. If you opt to buy new ear pads on top of a new pair of these headphones, I'd say you've reached a great value for some good headphones.

  At first I wanted to cry. Worked like a charm but after installing the app I found there was a firmware update available.

It worked finally but as I thought, only because I read up on this all night before and followed instructions to the tee this time. It’s an awkward means of upgrades with some uncertainty like when to power down the unit, connect to a USB source to RESET the device and a few other steps. Please READ EVERY WORD before you attempt to hit the RESTART button on the app after the 99% point otherwise you’ve got some serious fixes to make. Audio Technica needs to make this more clear as I’ve seen tons of posts where other users faced the same problem I did when the update finished and all the problems at the restart phase began.

  I had a BOSE QC 15 that I loved until the battery unexpectedly had a major leak. There was no warning, I just started hearing the popping warning sound of weak battery and when I opened the compartment, there was acid around the battery. That was the end of the headphone. It stopped working altogether. I found out that the warranty of course had expired. Also, that these headphones are not repaired (they are precision molded without any screws), but if they are malfunctioning,  they replace the whole thing under warranty. I was not about to spend another 300 plus dollars for something so easily breaking down.I kept searching for a long time for a good substitute and based on the excellent reviews I chose this headphone. I love bass, but did not want to be overwhelmed by it. I prefer a balanced sound with just the right touch of everything and this headphone turned out to be an excellent choice. I am not sure if any additional gadgets would be an absolute necessity (bass booster or amplifier). I use it with iPhone and my laptop. The sound is excellent. I recommend it without reservation.

    Most comfortable and best sounding head phones I've ever tried
  
",5.0,Computer Geek,"Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2018","









  
  
    
  These are the most expensive and by far the best set of cans I've ever had/listened to.  I compared these to Sennheiser HD560, Hyper X Cloud II, JBL, Plantronics, and Blue branded Cans. The prices ranged from $79-300.Previously I was using Monoprice DJ Style Head phones at my desk. For under $20 they're hard to beat. However, the clamp was a bit tight and the earcups a little small for my ears and caused pain after a few hours.The ATH-M50x has very comfortable earcups and headband. The worn pair I tried were more comfortable than the new ones I got from Amazon so I assume they need some breaking in. I wore them for four hours last night and had no problem at all.When I did my comparison at the store these were the loudest and most sonically pleasing to me personally compared to even the most expensive pair. I was trying to stay under $100 but the difference between these and those under $100 was worth the extra $50 for me.Compared to the Monoprice pair these blow them away. I don't notice a difference in range but what I do notice is that when the bass hits hard it doesn't muddle the highs and mids which would happen with the Monoprice pair.  These sound great with or without an eq.TL/DR: for $149 you get a pair of cans that is more comfortable and sounds better than many cans at higher prices. Compared to the cans in the $100 and under category, these will make you want to spend more!

    Great Monitoring Headphones But VERY Uncomfortable

  If you're basing this on pure audio quality these are spectacular. I'm not sure how I feel going from open to closed back but the sound signature is undeniably good. Along with that it sounds unique. There really is no replicating these headphones, pairing it with a decent DAC will also do it wonders. I don't necessarily  see the use in an AMP as my onboard audio drove it fine but if you have on available its worth using. Now the major con with these headphones are the comfort. Its horrendous, nearly unusable. I'd get the sudden, overpowering urge to remove these after around 30 minutes due to the awkward clamping force. The earpads also contribute to this issue as there's not enough cushion thus causing my ear to press up against the driver. A 3rd party replacement set of earpads fixed this issue but not without destroying the low end making the experience similar to a gaming headset. Modding of the earpads was needed to restore the sound to normal. Overall I think these headphones sound great, amazing even. But a product shouldn't need modding to make it shine.

    Best $149 Closed-back headphone on the market.  Period.  Bonus tip at the end of the review
  
",5.0,Vince Petersen,"Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2021","









  
  
    
  I was looking for a set monitor cans for my editing station at home.  As well as something that is good for just listening to jams and relaxing.  I went on reddit and posted asking what are the best headphones for around $200.  I wanted a closed back so I wouldn't annoy my wife any further from being locked down for so long and something that had the best most accurate sound quality.  Also wanted them wired so I could plug into an amplifier.  Response after response the ATH-M50X kept coming up so I picked up a pair.  When they showed up I was impressed with the build quality, yes they are plastic but feel sturdy and no creaking or cracking when twisted.  I was a little disappointed that it didn't come with the hard case shown in the pics, it came with a soft bag.  Now the good part.  So I was comparing between my Sony's and a couple high end ear buds I was blown away at the clarity and detail from the M50s.  They really shine when connected to an amplifier and listening to Master tracks on Tidal.The M50s were just so immersive, you could hear lots of details that I couldn't hear in the other cans.  The bass is not overpowering, it's controlled and clean.  I found the mids warm and accurate. The highs are little recessed, not tinny or blaring.  Overall just well balanced.  Soundstage is there but definitely feels like the music is coming right at you.  For $149 it's a no brainer.  You made it this far hooray!  Bonus tip: The ear pads aren't great, especially if you have larger ears.  They aren't the most comfortable for extended listening either.  So pick up a pair of Brainwavs ear pads, they have a bigger opening and the pad is memory foam so they are super comfortable.  Basically makes the M50s perfect.  Cheers!

    Absolutly hated them at first. Burn in +EQ!
  
",5.0,jonathan,"Reviewed in the United States November 19, 2015","









  
  
    
  When I got my m50x's I had high hopes cause of all the posative reviews and youtube reviews. I took them out of the box and listened to them and after an hour I was going to return them, cursing all the posative reviews.....I had a pair of m40x's for about a week and loved the balanced clean audio but wanted to upgrade cause of the 45mm driver size vs the 40mm to get more detail and richness that 40mm drives just didn't have. I was upset why the m50x sounded terrible, but then I did some research and discovered ""burn in time"" the audio technica Web site says they are good out of the box, other reviews says you do need to burn them in so the sound opens up....I decided what the heck, let's give that a try. Over 2 weeks I let them play music while I was away and listened to them as much as I could and after 2 weeks the sound has absolutely transformed and opend up.....the muddy tone that was drowning the music from my s5 had got cleaner...but...It got alot better but they still had too much bass that over powers the clarity and detail, yes it is true, but I found that if I download an EQ I can further transform the sound to be more balanced and flatter. I sat side by side with an 40x and the m50x and listened to the same song over and over for about an hour or 2.I got the m50x to match the balance of the m40x by adjusting and reducing the lower frequencies of 60hz to 230hz..also dropping a little off of the higher frequencies 3hz to 14hz just a tad according to the picture of the frequency spectrum of the m50x via Google images. That flattens out the sound alot and the 45mm driver size brings out clarity and detail better than the m40x, so basicly I transformed the m50x into a much better m40x and to me a much better version of the m50x. Now I love them and I have the versatility of adding bass back if I want to.Alot of the negative reviews are people like me just plugging them In and going off of the sound that is already their, with some burn in time and a simple eq download I can quickly and easily make these headphones sound alot more balanced if I want to and get rid of the muddy bass and bring out the clarity alot more. Their very good headphones now! My next step is a DAC to make them even better. Sometimes in life you have to make things work and work at them, you can't expect them to just be perfect right away and give up. Hope this helps anyone reading this.

  I suppose that for the price this set is OK. Sound quality is just OK. I would love a deeper bass sound but I guess that does not come with these less expensive headphones. My greatest aggravation is that I can't get more that about 30 feet from the device I am paired with. The headphones suddenly have static and then cut off. Honestly, I should probably send them back but I do use them when I can stay in the living room or kitchen but going about chores throughout the house is not possible. I am surprised at the 5 star reviews because I don't ""hear"" the quality that the reviews speak to. I would not buy these again! Update: I returned the headphones yesterday. After using a pair of my husband's less expensive set and learning that I could walk throughout the house and onto the deck without them cutting out, I knew that the ATH-MxBT do not suit my needs!

  These are great headphones for audio mixing or video editing. I also really enjoy listening to music with them as well. They have a very clean crisp sound to them. Really good highs and mids.I wouldn't recommend them if you are really into music with big bass, these have more of a punchy bass.Ergonomically these are the best headphones I could find. I was using the Sony MDR-7506 for a long time, but I would always get annoyed with how the coiled cable would tangle up and the exposed wire by the earpiece swivel would always get stuck or damaged. With these you can choose your cable and length. If it gets twisted up you can unplug from the ear piece and quickly untangle it and plug it back in. Also there are no wires by the earpiece swivel so you don't have to worry about the wire getting stuck. Also the pads over the earpiece last a lot longer than most headphone.

  these are probably the best pair  of headphones that i've ever used. I wanted a headset for general use. I play a lot of games on my computer and wanted a headset without a microphone attached to it.  I've wanted these for a few years now and after I started listening to music on my computer again and playing FPS games I wanted something more. Let me say my favorite things about these headphones is that I feel like I can hear each sound separately while listening to music.. I'm not sure what the term is but it's pretty amazing and takes music listening to the next level. the sound range is seems very wide and the bass isn't over the top but it's still there when you wanna bump. they're quite comfortable  with sliding adjustments on the side each cup and be 180 flipped pointing outwards and you can lay them flat on your chest from around your neck so you don't feel like you're choking. they are collapsable for easy transport in the carrying pouch if you're into that. the cord detaches from the headset allowing you to use the 3.5mm 3foot cable or the longer one it also has a larger size which i assume plugs into a DAC or more serious sound equipment. I don't find them heavy though I've been used to heavier ""gamer"" headsets until recently. If you'd like a very good review of them by a pro I'd want the MKBHD video on youtube about them it's what originally made me want them.

Currently the app is telling me 5% remaining and when I check the Bluetooth settings that's telling me 40% which seems more accurate from my last full charge which was three days ago and I use them about six hours a day roughly, actually yesterday I used them for a full twelve hours while the app was telling me 5% then.

  Comfortable, durable, and excellent audio quality. On a scale of 1-10, 1 being listening to music through two speakers in an old beater pickup, and 10 being a perfectly engineered musical auditorium, these are probably a 9 or 9.5. Bought these to replace a pair of circa 2008 Sony noise canceling headphones where the earpieces disintegrated, and audio stopped working in one earpiece. The AT do not noise cancel quite as well as past headphones I've had (airplane is the test environment) but sound far, far better. Glad I went with these over bluetooth, which I was considering.The cord is fat, durable, and for a 1/8 connection, it is closer to the build of a 1/4 guitar/musical cable than a 1/8 cheap headphone cable (I've had a lot of headphones/earbuds die where the right angle plug loses connectivity inside the cable) and will last a long time. The fact that various cables and a 1/4 connector plug is included is impressive.Worth the price tag. My only complaint is I wish I had these back when I was 12 years old and spent all my time listening to and playing music.

  I use to have the Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone and while they are great headphones I decided to go with a different set of headphones when they started to degrade. I read over some audiophile forums and the consensus for decent pair of headphones that will not break bank is the Audio-Technica M50x. I decided to trust the forums and the amazon reviews and decided to purchase these headphones.The Audio-Technica ATH-M50x is absolutely amazing, even better than my MDR7506. Not only is it comfortable but the sound is also amazing. I am no audiophile so I cannot comment on Lows, Mids, Highs, etc... but what I can say is that these headphones sound good and they are not expensive either which is the great part.I love the removable head jack, it makes traveling with the headphones easy and I can change the cord length depending on how close the device I am trying to use it. I also own another pair of Audio-Technica but the head jack is not removable.

I don't find them to be overly bulky, heavy or cumbersome at all.I'm no audiophile who can tell you the subtle differences in quality and depth etc, but I dig these bad boys, and if you are looking for some cans in this price range, these will make you happy.

  LOVE THESE!  I've had these headphones now for about a year and they are still going strong.  I primarily use these for music on my phone and watching things on the iPad and have no complaints whatsoever.  The sound is GREAT.  Very crisp.  I also used them at my old job and would have them on for most of the day (about 7-8 hours) and never had any sort of discomfort.Not much sound leakage on these, but it all depends on how loud you listen.  If you have music all the way up, yes, people will be able to hear you a little bit.  I would have the volume up a good amount, and wouldn't have any issues.  Nobody every seems bothered by me at work.While these aren't true noise cancelling headphones, they did quite a great job at getting rid of any outside noise.  I can barely hear anything other than music when I have these on.  That was a big plus for me.  I also loved the detachable cable on the M50x, especially for the fact that if I ever need a replacement, it's very easy to get

  I picked these up because I wanted to get a more neutral sound when editing videos, As far as sound goes, I can completely understand why so many people like these. They produce a really good amount of sound and not just any sound, a clear and accurate sound. I was also pleasantly surprised at how well these sound when listen to music. You would naturally assume that reference headphones would only be good for editing audio due tot he more neutral sound but that's not the case here. Now I won't get into an in-depth comparison but I also own the Beats Studio wireless and these are a bit louder...which is definitely a plus. They are also really comfortable. I've been able to wear these for 3 to 4 hours without any problem. The only negative point for me (which is the reason that I did not rate these 5 stars) is the build. I really dislike the shinny plastic material. It makes the headphones look cheap. It almost looks like they were spray painted. The ear cups also look painted. From experience (if) this  is the case, this painting style tends to crack over time. I'm curious to see how they will fair. With that said, i'd definitely recommend these. They perform really well and are among the best at this price.

  The wireless does resemble the wired in terms of sonic signature, but thats were the similarities end. The wireless don't do a good job at handling treble at higher volumes. Don't even think of using the wireless in wired mode, it like listening to a 5$ headphones. It's bad very bad. Overall I am actually disappointed with these. If you are looking for good bluetooth headphones with little emphasis on bass without effecting other frequencies I would recommend P7's even though they are 200$ more expensive and are a bit more uncomfortable than M50XBT, they are worth it.I completely forgot about the app, it's a joke, I don't even know what purpose the app serves other than collecting your personal information and location information.Call taking is a mixed experience sometimes its ok sometimes it's not. I wouldn't buy them if one of my check lists had taking calls reguarly on it.

  These work fantastic for monitoring the voicework I do.  I use em for everything else too (gaming, easy listening).  They are fine, but they are of course geared to fidelity monitoring, so ofc it doesn't enhance those sounds.  They are designed for audio work, not (especially) enjoyment.The comfort level of the headband/earcups is fine to me, but I'm also not too picky.  They can be a pinch tight after a long session, but I think the earcups are swappable(sold seprately)The cord (for this model) is wired to be detachable but more so you can swap it out.  They are NOT wireless.  they give you three different styles of cords to use which is cool, but they have a little divot that makes the whole thing slightly proprietary to my understanding.  Anyway, it's overall way better options than having a irremovable cord, so no sincere complaints.Overall I'd recommend them for amateur level audio-professionals.  Not qualified to say much past that.

  Let's keep this short, the overall quality is good, but there is a little piece near the joint for lateral movements that is quite fragile and prone to breaking if it gets knocked off your desk in a bad position.  If this piece breaks, when you put the headset on the ear cup will push outwards, and only the top of the cup will touch your ear.  This is quite disappointing, though it may be possible to fix.

  I love these headphones so much I bought them again after my first pair broke after three or so years. And I bought them as a gift for my brother.These are a great introduction into high quality headphones. I saw a video of Rick Rubin doing a recording at his studio in California. Everyone was wearing Audiotechnicas, and I think some of them were ATH-M50s and M50xs. They have a clear, clean, balanced sound. the response curve is flat, so if you just want bumping base without being able to hear the highs and mids as clearly, these are not for you. I don't produce music, but i listen to a lot of it. And I love hearing all parts of the music on a wide sound stage (compared to something like SkullCandy's aviator heapdhones).My only complaint is that they use their own custom, locking cord. I think they do this so that it wears more slowly, but I think they could have come up with a clever solution that allowed the use of standard 3.5mm cords. Anyway, that's a small price to pay for great sounding headphones. I also recommend getting the wireless adapter if you're of the bluetooth persuasion.

Instead they wanted me to PAY FOR THE SHIPPING and wait a few weeks to get my product back.This is my second pair of headphones, my first one lasted a little over two years and broke at multiple points due to cheap plastic components but this is absolutely ridiculous. I will never purchase another one of their products again.

  Finally hit the 1 year mark with these. Heavy usage at least 200 hours on them (music producer) so let's get to the product.After weeks of reading reviews and going through all the pros and cons about headphones from the $100-$200 range I finally bought these.First day I got them. Amazing packaging very neat and straight forward. They're made on really high quality materials. Yes plastic is evolved in the making of these headphones but don't let that scare you away. They look and feel amazing.After unwrapping everything I came to the point where it was time to give these a go. I plugged them straight into my laptop and played a random song. I was really amazed with the quality coming from some okay Sony headphones.So hears exactly how they sound in the best way I can explain.Vocals: amazing and very wide. They are pronounced the most in the mixBass: lacks deepness. These are not for bass heads at all. I have a hard time jamming to trap or house music with these because the bass is lacking. Imagine being in movie theater and then a huge explosion goes off and James Bond does a triple back flip off a moving plane landing on his bear feet on a pile of radio active scorpions but you can't feel the deepness of the explosion and it sounds like it's covered by a whole bunch of neglected pillows who only wish to be loved again.Highs= 8/10Mids= 7/10Lows= 4/10I run these now on an apollo interface and they sounds beautiful. But even a 1 thousand dollar interface couldn't bring up those lows at all.OVER ALL REVIEW-They're great for beginners who want to hear Chris Brown swallow in between verses but you won't be able to hear him slap women in the background.

  5/5 amazing headphones! I just received these M50x with the amp bundle. I first plugged it in without the amp to see how they work. They sounded amazing, very clear and flawless sound. I have had the experience of many headphones and these are by far the best pair I have ever experienced.I decided to plug in the mini headphone amp it I bundled it with....It was one of the greatest music experiences! The amp made the music sound unbelievable! High quality sound that flowed like a river of music through my ears giving me a flawless symphony of sounds. I did not want to stop the music, I am still listening now. You can increase the bass with the little amp and boy does it work!! Highly recommend the bundle! would by again

    Looking for great headphones that don't have a brand tax? Audio-Technica has you covered with their ATH-M50x.
  
",5.0,David L Sumner,"Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2018","What is it?
These headphones are of awesome quality. Personally I think these are the headphones to
purchase when you are more serious about audio rather that the brand name.

What’s Hot
- Superior audio quality
- Lightweight and comfortable to wear for long periods of time.
- Comes with 3 different wires
- Comes with leather carrying bag
- Headphone are collapsable
- Ships with 1/4 inch adapter

What’s Not
- $150 isn't a bad price but going cheaper would be nicer.
- Proprietary headphone connector means you can use random headphone wires
- Being that headphones are collapsable the hinges are bound to wear over time.
- I feel they should have shipped with a microphone enabled wire.

Design:
These are geat looking headphones. Not only are they good looking but they are comfortable to
wear for long periods of time.

Features:
This would have been perfect if they have included a wire with an inline mic. Otherwise, this is
the total package for headphones. If you want to hear audio the way it was recorded, this is
the route to go. Including 3 different wires and leather pouch was a great idea.

Performance:
Audio Quality is superb. Music sounds like it should. If you want overstated bass I suggest you
look somewhere else though. These are the best all-around headphone that you can buy under $200.

Value:
For $150 you can't go wrong here. You can find others in this price range like Beats, and
Skullcandy, as well as Sony. None of the others will sound a good as these do though.
This would have been a perfect if they were around $120 or if they included in line mic.

Test of time | Recommendation :
These headphones aren't new. They are technically ATH-M50(s) with a detachable wire.
The ATH-M50 released in 2007. That is 11 years of being one of the best headphones you can
buy (at a normal consumer level). I highly recommend these headphones to anyone looking for
great over-the-ear headphones or to people considering purchasing comparable products.

Thoughts
I have been eying these headphones for about 2 years now and finally caved in a brought them.
I have to say I'm glad i did. I was gonna just pick up some Bluetooth pair of earbuds but this was
definitely the better route to take. Currently I my main phone still supports a 3.5mm headphone
jack so I don't have to worry about compatibility at the moment. On another note, these headphones
also sound amazing when using them with my Digital Piano. My previous ones all sound like crap.",Color: BlackStyle: Wired

    Not $200 headphones (cheap construction)
  
",2.0,ZR,"Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2018","









  
  
    
  I'm certainly no audiophile but I do have a strong appreciation for quality audio. I bought a pair of these headphones to replace my Sony MDRXB950BT. The Sony headphones construction was garbage. It was mostly plastic so while the headphones worked great they basically crumbled to peices. Both were priced at $200. Here's what I found.The Audio-Technica headphones are also made of plastic. All the components on my Sony headphones that failed were plastic and those same components are plastic on the Audio-Technicas as well. Specifically the peice that attatches the speakers to the head band. Not good as that is the part that will be under the most strain.The Audio-Technica headphones have VERY little bass. Granted the Sony's I had were geared towards solid bass so the difference was very noticable.The audio is crystal clear (when they aren't cutting out). I immediately noticed that the audio quality of the Audio-Technicas were significantly better than the Sony.I like the headphones a lot but not for the price. These are legitimately worth $100 - $120. So I'm definitely returning them. I wouldn't recommend these unless they are at a very reduced price. Audio-Technica has a similar pair that are cheaper with the only difference being they don't support Bluetooth. I would've been happier with those. The Bluetooth feature doesn't justify the price difference between the set (even if it worked properly). Poor showing Audio-Technica...Update: Shortly after returning the Audio-Technicas I decided to try V-Moda Crossfade Wireless. Immediately fell in love with them. Awesome build quality, great clear sound and more bass. I went with the original Crossfade and not the Crossfade 2 because if several different product reviews and ended up spending $115. They were on Amazon.

  I've had these headphones for about a year now and I absolutely love them.I initially purchased the Pioneer HDJ-2000 for DJing.  I liked the way they sounded so I started using them for producing as well.  But, I must have a weird shaped head or something because they started hurting my ears after sessions with extended usage.  After doing all the research I could think of I decided to pick these up and I'm super glad that I did.  I found that I can wear these for longer sessions and, IMO, they actually sound better than the HDJ's.  I would recommend these to anybody.Also...I've dropped these headphones from time to time but they still sound fantastic.  Hope this helps.

    Best DJ cans on Amazon
  
",5.0,Formica,"Reviewed in the United States November 28, 2017","









  
  
    
  My ATH-M50x headphones are, bar none, the best headphones I have ever owned. As a club and mobile DJ, I need cans that are durable, reliable, clear, and crisp. The M50x satisfy all of these requirements with flourish. The M50s are often compared to the Sony VDR6/MDR-7506 in the DJ world, and I find the M50s superior in every way. They are pricey (and the noted Sonys can often be had for half the list price of the M50s) but worth every penny. If value is important, keep an eye out for sales - the M50s can be had for $100 from time to time (that's what I paid for them).In terms of durability, I have dragged these cans through the club, three Burning Mans, two dozen house parties, and every day use, and they still sound perfect. Deep bass, bright mids, clear highs. The vinyl pads even have yet to start disintegrating!Another feature the M50x has over competing phones - the replaceable cord! I went through multiple MDR-7506s whose cords failed in one form or another. Some got munched, others just quit on me. While the 7506s have big solder pads, even then I was never able to successfully replace the cord. The M50x however, should the cord ever quit or get damaged, has a detachable and replaceable cord that can keep these cans going for years to come.The ATH-M50x headphones are a bit expensive, but I wish I'd bought them first before going through three sets of 7506s. I would have ended up saving money!Edited July 1, 2020: After five years, the ATH-M50x cans are still going strong. They have been to Burning Man five times, gone to dozens of gigs, and get near daily use in a house with three cats that love dangling cords. The only part I have replaced is the ear pads, which I upgraded to some nice comfy memory foam. I can't recommend them enough!

  There are many different types of headphones on the market these days and it's kind of difficult trying to justify a +$100 the price for a pair of headphones when I distinctly remember buying headphones when I was much younger, without disposable income, on a pair of headphones for $20 at your local electronics store.  I am also not an audiophile so I don't feel like I am able to judge the quality of sound from headphone A to headphone B.  But after much research (YouTube videos and Blogs) I felt like I should indulge myself into this world of audio that I never really learned to appreciate.It has been said about these headphones time and time again that they are very neutral and provide great quality.  I never understood this until I put these on and listened to many many different genres of music.  Things that were drowned in my Bass heavy headphones became as clear as day and made me learn to appreciate many more artists.  From subtle breaths that the singer takes before a big solo or how a 'TWANG' is plucked hard or soft becomes much more apparent.  I believe there is a lot from music that isn't heard or felt because of the way it is heard and the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x's is a great tool for you to learn to appreciate sound/music.  If I haven't become an audiophile in a few years because of these headphones then I should at least be on track to understand the nuances that make listening to music enjoyable.I will also be using these for field recording with lavalier microphones and shotgun mics in the near future and I will update about the overall construction and durability once I've gained some experience with these headphones.  For the few months that I've had them they have held up great and cables hold on strong.  They also feel great.

  I love these headphones. They feel like a quality product: the leather feels soft and the cushions are really comfortable. They are sturdy yet flexible, which makes it ideal. The size can be adjusted fairly easily, but they stay locked in place unless you change it again.The sound: 9.6/10. -0.4 since they're not the best for gaming (naturally); it doesn't sound as bass-y as I'd like, only for games. For everything else, the sound is beautiful. Well balanced, clean. I love it.I'd say they're uncomfortable for people with glasses, myself being one, but it may just be the fact that I've spent so much time wearing them (7-8h straight daily). I do have to take them off every 45mins or so to get some air on my ears, otherwise they get really warm.These are not just one of the best headphones for $140, they are one of the best headphones. Period.

  I find these headphones to be perfect for daily life and in the studio.1) They are extremely comfortable. I can spend 3+ hours with these on my head and only have to readjust a few times.2) They sound great. They have a very even frequency range and sound great with all kinds of music- from classical to hip-hop, rock to dance. Yes, I listen to all of these genres.3) The noise rejection is just right. They work well in transit, because they block out enough noise to hear the music well, but still allow me to be aware of the sounds in my surroundings and not get hit by a car or even miss my stop on the bus, for example.Overall definitely say these are a great buy, especially if you can get them on sale! I got them on sale for $125-$130 US.

  Pros:-Amazing, comfortable sound profile long listening of all music and gaming with good punchy bass.-Decently comfortableCons:-You will likely have to replace the ear-cups and headband assembly multiple times over the lifetime of these because the pleather coating will peal/flake off over time. Probably within the end of a year or after the first year of owning them, which won't be covered under warranty, so calculate this into the cost of owning these. While spending 40 dollars and some time on replacing these, it's better than re-buying them new, but still not fun. An alternative for the long term flaking would be to buy a headband cover, and aftermarket earpads that are of a cloth type of material instead of pleather coated ones that come with it.

    Fan of the original m50x for studio/Live performance applications? stick with the wired version...
  
",2.0,Aaron,"Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2019","









  
  
    
  This is clearly a general consumer model and not an ""Improvement"" on the original model. There is only one single audio cable as apposed to the 3 that came with the wired model. There is no 1/4"" adapter. Aside from not having the ability to plug into 90% of the audio interfaces on the market(which is a HUGE inconvenience).. the BIGGEST deal breaker for me is that the audio cable does not twist/lock into place. This means that with nothing but a light tug, you've just lost signal. Have fun fumbling around getting it plugged back in in a dark room with flashing lights. This totally removes their reliability for any kind of live performance monitoring in my mind. Things happen. If you enjoyed the m50x, just keep the OG's. These have been marketed as ""if you liked the m50x, now they have bluetooth capability"" which to me, is a total farce. They don't seem to retain the wired model's extra flat profile, which(aside from the aforementioned complaints) further reduces it's usefulness for studio applications.Sound quality is decent for consumer use. Battery life is great. Bluetooth is decent. This is the only reason it gets a 2 star.Bottom line, the sound quality is decent for consumer use. Battery life is great. Bluetooth is decent. This is the only reason it gets a 2 star. So, if you are just looking for a decent pair of cans for the morning commute, for the gym, or just personal listening, these are a good choice. If you are looking for an professional use, this is not an upgrade. Just go with the m50x original. It's cheaper, has more cord options. It is more reliable for live AND studio

  I've owned these for about 5 months and have almost no complaints. The sound is literally so well balanced and well-designed  that I can't tell how loud my music is until my ears start to hurt. There is a little distortion at max volume, but I don't plan on listening at this level for any extended period of time. There is also very little if any sound leakage which is great for an office environment. The reason for four stars is because, after 5 months of ownership, the right earpiece stopped producing sound. I tried a few different cables and different audio sources and all produced the same issue. Ultimately I had to send it in for warranty repair. This was a very seamless process and there was no hassle whatsoever. If I would have paid the $100+ for overnight shipping, their warranty documentation states they would have tried to repair it same-day and return it with the same overnight shipping. That's pretty impressive in my book! The only caveat with this process is that there was no communication until I received a return tracking number. It would've been nice to have received an email letting me know that they received the item and when I could expect the headphones to be returned, but I'm otherwise very satisfied with the process. I would very highly recommend these to anyone looking for a great pair of headphones from a great company.

  5 years ago I bought these headphones. Their sound quality is all you really need for your average listener. The only problems I've had with these is that the headband makes the top of my head hurt, so I can't wear these for long periods of time. I would recommend looking into modding a head strap onto these as well if it bothers you. Another issue is that its plastic, which is good for weight but not so much for durability. A bit if the headphones broke and I ended up taping it together which did the job. Would I recommend traveling with it? Sure if you don't have other options, and really having the additional cables in my bag can be annoying (I already have too much) so getting the bluetooth ones might be good if youre ok with charging them all the time and don't have worries about possible sound delay.

  In order to use these worthless headphones, I had to use their own cable. What about the Bluetooth function? By far, the worst Bluetooth device I've ever used. It rarely paired with my computer and phone and, even when it did, the audio quality over Bluetooth was worse than a cheap $5 pair of Walmart headphones.The cable it comes with is too short to be of any use. Because of the aforementioned issues of Bluetooth being worse than anything I've ever used, I had to use the worthless, non locking cable. The basic M50, even with its proprietary locking cable that I used to hate, is far superior since I never had to fear that the cable would rip out by me slightly adjusting how I'm sitting.In short, if you like wasting money, you'll love these things! If you like sound quality and having a usable product that won't make you want to throw against the wall just for existing, save money and buy the non Bluetooth version. If you still want Bluetooth, for whatever crazy reason you unreasonable idiot, buy a different set of headphones.

They’re extremely durable, which even saying that feels like an understatement. The look of them has not deteriorated whatsoever after 4 years even though I’m known to be heavy handed. However, I did replace the ear cups on the day I revived them because after market ear cups are hard to beat. For this reason, I’m not sure how the original ear cups would’ve help up those 4 years. I like them so much that I’ve bought my brother a pair and myself 2 extra pairs (one for my bedside and one for my workplace because I’m big time lazy). Music and gaming all sounds phenomenal. I would’ve given these a 5/5 on noise cancelling as well, but since they do not have active noise cancellation, I’m forced to put them at a 4/5. They’re stylish and low profile.

I would say they would make decent monitors if there was not an issue where the low treble and high mids cross over. I am guess they boosted here to keep the sound from becoming muddy due to inferior drivers. It helps vocals cut through, but colors the sound.Imaging is decent, dynamics are very good, music sounds punchy and tight, but I can not hear a brush on the symbols on a track with loud guitar, so on that level the imaging is average.these would porbably be good headphones for watching TV, or a less discerning music listener..

  These headphones were my favorite purchase in 2015.While its almost comical, I originally wanted over-the-ear headphones to keep my ears warm while listening to music during my morning walk to work (and it doesn't leave you with hat hair, ladies)! But after an initial search, I got knees deep in finding the BEST quality headphones for my money.I am a devout lover of music and typically used ear buds. I used to wonder why speaker and headphone sound quality were so important to some people... now I know why. The second I put these over my ears, my life was changed. The sound was so crisp, so smooth, and captured the tones and bass in a way I have never experienced. I was hooked.Since my purchase, I have spread the greatness of these headphones like nobody's business. 3 of my co-workers and 2 of my friends purchased these after hearing me obsessively gush and letting them take a test drive. The kicker? One of my co-workers is a huge sound quality buff and owns 4+ pairs of high quality headphones. He bought these and they are now his favorite set!Thank you Audio-Technica for rocking my world.

  Wonderful headphones. Sound is crystal clear with no over emphasized bass or treble.  I’m hearing things I’ve never heard before when listing to songs I’ve played a million times before. These are easily the best sounding headphones I’ve ever owned. I set all EQ to flat or off just to get a base line. The sound is is so defined that I didn’t need to turn the EQ back on. I didn’t need it. All my music is perfectly balanced from songs with heavy baselines to songs that are vocal heavy. Bass isn’t overpowering and treble isn’t shrill. It just sounds Incredible. I’m using a gen 5.5 iPod classic which has been touted as the best sounding Apple device ever made.How to quantify my experience with these headphones so you know where I’m coming from... I was curious to see if I could tell the difference between good and great sounding music, I went to a website that plays two versions of the same recording where one clip is higher def than the other. I was always able to pick out the better sounding version. I had to really listen, the difference was so subtle. It’s far from scientific but at least I know my hearing is somewhat sensitive.Now the bad...my ears hurt.  After the first 2 hours my ears felt a little sore.  This is because there isn’t enough padding so my ears are up against the speaker grille. My ears aren’t big either. They don’t stick out at all. My ears are probably a small-med sized ear. I already purchased a better set of ear padding.  All in, these cost me almost 200 dollars. Are they worth it? So far, a solid yes. I deducted one star for the uncomfortable ear cups.

  The Audio technical brand has been a bit like an under ground hip hop community though it has been ignored and sometimes never even heard of due to to over whelming mainstream music (i.e. Beats) once you experience the real music you can never go back. the complete of saturation of beats has made regular non audio files believe that beats are gold standard headphones. While they are just like the prada of headphones, you are paying for a brand. Nothing more. while when you buy something like these ATH M50's you are paying for sound quality and comfortability for long listening sessions. I was gifted a pair of beats studios for my birthday and up until then I listened to music on earbuds and when i put them on i heard that the music was better so i used the crap out of them until my friend let me try these on.....Wow just wow, these head phones are just amazing to listen to and put on. the sound is crisp and clear with a balanced sound stage. these headphones are a great entry level pair of head phones and i'm very curious if these can be the beats to an even more premium pair of head phones.

",5.0,Tom C,"Reviewed in the United States June 14, 2019","









  
  
    
  I loved the Bluetooth version so much that I bought this wired version too. The sound is amazingly clean and natural from thunderous lows (when content calls for it) to crisp highs with accurate mid tones.  I play piano and guitar and demand natural sound, not colored sound. When using a Yamaha digital piano with these, the sound produced from each key is heard almost as accurate as if the headset wasn’t used thanks to the Yamaha technology they’re noted for when using headphones for studio use. Having said this, without a headset that is geared for professional studio use like this one is, all of the technology Yamaha could create would ever be utilized.  This headset delivers accuracy!  When deep low notes are played, you hear these natural low notes with a powerful punch only during those notes! The sound from this wired version is identical to the newer wireless model which is impressive! The cords are NOT interchangeable with both models unfortunately. The Fantasia upgraded cable sold here on Amazon is worth the small investment since it is superior to the 9 ft cable provided. This is my favorite headset along with the wireless version ATH-M50xBT. You’re not going to want to take these beauties off your head after you hear the accurate dynamic range up and down the entire music spectrum. As a musician, this outperforms the Bose , Marantz and Yamaha sound monitor models. Yamaha is not known for headphones so I’m not surprised. I am however surprised Marantz could not deliver the sound I would expect from a premium brand. The Sony Professional MDR-7506, also a studio monitor headset,  is a very close competitor to the ATH-M50x and BT units. I own all three and love them equally. The Sony is not as solidly built as the Audio Technica models. The ear pads on the AT models look and feel much more leather-like than with the Sony. In summary, this along with the Sony MDR-7506 are the industry standard all others are measured to. This is why these two classics are the choice of studios.

  First of all I'm a gamer and streamer so I needed good quality headphones. I tried a couple and these ones just won in all categories. I tried HyperX Cloud II, HyperX Cloud Alpha, Corsair Void Pro, Razer Man O'War and quite honestly for sound quality, comfortable, and clarity.. these ones are the best ones out of this list. The HyperX Cloud II and Alpha would be my 2nd and 3rd pick on this list. The only thing I recommend if you purchase these headphones is to get the BRAINWAVZ memory foam ear cushions as they are 10x more comfortable and highly recommended with the AudioTechnica community. Also great style/fashion color if you choose to go with white!

These things are EPIC!Not only is the sound from the headphones crystal clear, evenly responsive and wonderfully accurate, but because of the higher quality construction, there's practically no noise from the hinges creaking when I move around - something that was annoying about my old M30's.If you're in the market for some fabulous headphones that accurately reproduce the original music as recorded, look no further. If you want headphones that massively amplify bass at the cost of general music quality look elsewhere.

  The pros:- The insulation adds some passive noise dampening of the outside world.- The insulation keeps you from annoying your neighbors when you're blasting deathcore like BroJob or hiphop like A$AP Rocky- The design is inconspicuousThe cons:- The sound quality is just OK. It's got punchy bass, but it can't compare with something like the Grado SR80.- The pads, for me, were uncomfortable to wear for over 30 minutes or so.- The closed design actually makes these like ear muffs, so you can get sweaty while wearing these.Overall, these are great for school or office use, if you have to be considerate of your neighbors. If you have your own space, go with Grado for sure. But they're a bit stuffy and uncomfortable.

  I plan to start recording music of my own at home.  So, I've been researching everything I'd need.  A decent pair of monitor headphones are at the top of the ""essential"" list.  I figured that if I were going to be spending money on some headphones, I'd like them to work casual use as well as mixing.  So, after lots of digging, reading reviews, watching comparison videos, I have determined that the M50x would be the best for me, for the following reasons:* Excellent sound quality* Relatively flat response rate* Comfortable with glasses* Detachable cables (included with purchase)* Reasonably affordableI'm glad I put in all the legwork ahead of time.  These arrived yesterday, and I've worn them for several hours, listening to music (mostly rock, metal and pop) and playing games (Diablo 3 and Skyrim.)  The sound quality is outstanding.  Admittedly, these are the first studio monitors I've listened to.  I've owned decent ""fun"" headphones in the past (~$50 range) and these are by far superior to what I've experienced.It took me a bit to settle on these, as some folks claimed that they were either bass heavy, harsh, or uncomfortable.  Fortunately, I've found none of this to be true.  I've had these on for up to 2 hours with no discomfort what-so-ever.  When it comes to the sound, all I can say is ""wow!""  Everything is extremely clear, and I feel, balanced.  The bass is definitely there, but it's not overpowering, and it certainly doesn't detract from other frequencies.  The high end comes in really well, and not harsh at all to me.  The layers in the music I've listened to so far are so much easier to distinguish.In the past, I've been able to accurately distinguish various bitrate MP3s/audio files over laptop speakers (128 vs 256 vs lossless.)  These headphones make it way easier.

  As with all user product reviews, personal impressions are completely subjective, but I am one that generally relies on these reviews for most of my purchases. I am a ""home recording enthusiast"", and I have used the previous version of these headphones for many years, so I must admit a bias towards them. Reviews, even professional reviews, can only get you so far with something like this. If you live near enough to a music store, you really need to demo headphone to find your preference.That said, I find the ATH-M50x to be very well balance, with a solid (but not hyped) bottom end, a natural to slightly warm mid-range, and a clean (but not overly bright) high-end. For me, that makes them near perfect. As a musician recording at home, so much of the work is done wearing cans, and I can wear the M50x for hours without any fatigue or discomfort. Most importantly, these headphones are ""neutral"" enough that I can get almost 90% of the way to a finished mix before needing to switch to monitors to get the final mix. This makes working at home, and not driving my family crazy by hearing the same song over and over again during the tracking and mixing process, much easier.

  LOVE how these sound.  I was in the market for a pair of good headphones for general music listening as well as PC gaming.  I originally looked at all-in-one headsets which have simulated surround sound and mics, and all the bells and whistles.  I looked at so many different brands and price points.  Ultimately, I decided that SOUND QUALITY and not a bunch of extras is the most important thing.  I do some gaming, but not nearly enough to justify the loss in quality you get from those all-in-one headphones.  Mostly, I listen to a lot of music while I do photo editing on my PC and good stereo sound quality is the most important thing for me.To compare, I should add that I own a pair of Beyerdynamic DT 770s, which many people recommend over the M50x.  I personally disagree.  I consider the M50x a big upgrade.  Music sounds richer, with more powerful (but not too powerful) bass, and crystal clear treble. Everything just sounds much more engrossing and music that I've listened to for years suddenly come to life with a richness I didn't hear before.I am pairing the M50x with a SMSL SD793-II amp and it sounds amazing.  You don't need an amp to get great audio out of these headphones, but using one will provide subtle but noticeable improvement in audio quality.I also own a pair of turtle beach surround sound headphones for my PS4, and these blow those out of the water.  Like I said, the all-in-one headsets just can't compete with a nice pair of stereo headphones if pure sound quality is a priority.I HIGHLY recommend these headphones, and frankly, I can't believe they are so affordable.  Unbelievable value.  The build quality is fantastic, and they are very comfortable.  No complaints whatsoever.  Would recommend to anyone looking for nice headphones.

  Full disclaimer, I'm not a audiophile by any means. I may not be able to immediately discern differences in different ranges of audio like others more experienced might.90% of my time awake is usually spent at a PC, and I listen to a very large array of music, from harsher bands like Korpiklaani, Korn,  Mastodon, to softer things like Sleep Dealer, Yiruma, Beethoven, etc. I tend to favor (But obviously not strictly) instrumental or vocalless music, and I also listen to a extremely large array of videogame music.I love to listen to music while I'm, say, programming or just lazing about. But I don't like using speakers, since I have a roommate I don't like to disturb.To this end, I was looking for a good pair of 'all around' headphones that were 'great' (IE: Better than a poopy $20 walmart pair that, even to me sounds flat as heck) but reasonably priced, and reviews and research led me to this pair of headphones.I'm in love with them so far. They seem really great all around. Basey, but not painfully so. And definitely far from the flat cheaper headsets you'd normally find around.It comes with a few different sizes and types of cords, so you should always have a nearly perfect length of wire for what you're using. That said, I just about always just use the longest cord, but that's just for my setup.I also put the headphones through a bit of abuse. Not on purpose, but I tend to lounge around in my hair weirdly, and get uncomfortable if I'm one position for too long. So the wire will sometimes wrap around the chair weirdly when I'm not paying attention, and in a couple cases it's been enough to tug the headphones right off my head and onto the floor. But it's held up pretty well anyway, so I'd say they're also pretty durable.I kind of dislike that you can't just use any old aux cable for it, since it comes with a specialized cable that 'locks' into the headphones. But it's not really a issue, just preference.I'd definitely recommend this pair of headphones to anyone looking for a reasonably price 'good' pair of headphones for regular general use. And I'll definitely get a pair of these again if I somehow break or lose them.

  I got these to replace my aging SR-125s that have fallen apparent one to many times.These headphones sound good, not as good as the SR-125s mind you, but good. I think part of the issue is they are closed where the SR-125s were open. On the flip side the sound isolation of these is amazing, put them on and forget the noisy cube mates.The build quality of these is also really really good. Way better then the SR-125s. Perhaps WAY better then anything I have purchased in a long time.I'm not however too fond of the length of the plug that plugs into the headphones. I find it frequently catching on my shirt every time I turn my head which is super annoying.If the build quality and design of the Grado Labs were better I would probably have gone that direction again, but it is not - so there you go.

  I have owned these headphones for 6 months. I'm semi-audiophiliac.  They've generally been my go to for listening to music. I'm only writing this review because I unlocked the truth i'd been missing out on for 6 months. That's my resume.Here are my thoughts on why you should choose these over budget or more expensive headphones. ( & yes, you should, but read on.)These are great no matter what you plug them into. I'll give them that. You will be generally impressed if you plug them into your iphone, android, mac, etc.. They're pretty darned good. The volume is perfect, the highs are there but tame enough while keeping truth. You won't blow your eardrum tweeter, but the highs are definitely there and serviceable to truthiness of the treble band.  The bass is true bass. It's not overly exaggerated; these WILL NOT give you an ear massage, it will however give you pretty close to exact bass. That's actually a fantastic thing, learning to appreciate bass rather than it treating your ears as a trampoline is definitely an enlightenment.I mainly use these with Spotify for my music diet. I'm a premium subscriber which gives me the rights to their high quality streams. These WILL expose bad recordings. Certain punk rock will not sound good as high quality electronic or high end produced modern pop. The ATH-M50x's keep the recording quality obvious, but I would go on to say that they're pretty forgiving at the same time. If you picked up a pair of AT's higher priced cans, you'd probably expose even more, and is that worth it? Ehhhh it's up to you, but these are the sweet spot for the price if you're really looking to find flaws in recording, ya geek.The biggest take away for these cans is this: while plugging them into anything will get you great audio, what they're plugged into matters.They will expose the the truth of the audio output of the device they're plugged into. An Iphone won't sound as good as plugged into a macbook pro which won't sound as good as a pc with a good sound card. I'd been running these on my dell monitors headphone jack, which runs into an nvidia 980ti GPU, which serves up audio through the mentioned audio jack. It was okay. Today I pulled out the long 3.5mm male to 2.5mm male (the connection on the ATH-M50's is 2.5mm fyi) that came with these and decided to plug these into my gaming pc that has a decent realtek soundcard...Oh my lord panty dropping audio blissfulness, the gods have spoken, how the hell did I miss this, hot damn.It awoke the beast. I cannot say more until you try these in a preamp (coworkers recommended) or something that pumps out decent audio.These are a catalyst, you just need the correct crucible to handle it. You pair these babies with the correct output mechanism, and it will be one of the best 100$ range headphones you'll have ever have bought. Sky's the limit, just feed them correctly.Since owning these, I've bought other Audio-Technica audio and recording devices. Have a set of their ATH-CKS55XBT blue tooth headphones :

  What's not to love. I have been using Audio-Technica headphones for about 4 years now. In my opinion, they will always be better than beats. The sound quality is amazing, they fit well, and are not unstylish either. I got these after my old ones were getting pretty worn out. The old version did not have interchangeable chords. This new feature is my favorite thing EVER! being able to disconnect the chord when I store the headphones has definitely lengthened the chords life. It is also great that I can choose if I want a short or a long chord. I use these every single day. I take them with me wherever I go. They are amazing. They are not completely noise canceling, but you really can't hear anything (unless someone is being super loud or is right next to you) when you have your music playing. One thing I would recommend is to get a protective headband strap. The material on the strap of the headphones is prone to flaking, to stop this, just use a knitted strap (can be found on amazon).

After reading very positive reviews I purchased the Sony 7506 wired headphone.  I was perfectly satisfied with my new 7506, but on a whim I thought I would compare it to my old beat up model M50x.  OMG!!  There was no comparison whatsoever!!So, in 5 minutes time I went from liking my 7506 to having it boxed up to ship back the next morning.  I promptly returned it and ordered myself a new M50x and two pairs of Brainwavz hybrid ear cups for BOTH of my M50x headphones.  Yes, I did something dumb, but it all worked out in the end, and I won't be straying again from Audio-Technica!!

",5.0,dean eldridge,"Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  These are the best headphones you can buy for under $300. I had the M40x for 6 years before they finally broke, and upgrading to the M50x was a great decision. The build quality is much better, I can tell it will last even longer. The sound is as true as it gets - no extra bass or trebble and every little detail is clearly aueivpe with these headphones.

  I like the sound the phones produce but the volume is not loud enough for my taste using an iPhone. With the volume up as high as it can go I still could use a lot more. I don't listen to it overly loud and I am not hard of hearing but these phones just do not play loud enough for my liking. I will try them wired next but that kind of defeats the purpose for wireless headphones. Not entirely happy with this purchase.

  Sorry, no picture to assuage anxieties. But the review is honest & unpaid; in fact, I paid! $150 for ATs headphones from this OL vendor. Prior to these Audio-Technica headphones I was using a $20 SONY set. Audio-Technica is another dimension: Sound is perfectly reproduced. The versatility of the design is fabulous. Product quality validates that you get what you pay for: These are well designed; comfortable & private. TO WIT: This is not a long review, but all character & quality of what this 'presumptive' audiophile did wish to find represented in the product & the product's performance across utility & sound is 100% on expectation. No disappointment. Nothing but pleasurable comment for Audio-Technica ATH-M50x headphones.Ps. I do not ""game""; no comment there.

  TERRIFFIC! Neutral, Detailed, Full sound. What's not to like? Additionally, they are over ear and block sound entering/leaking while being extremely comfortable. I'm a VO Pro and I'm confident with these. Actually when I recently left Tokyo for Los Angeles, I gave my Studio Monitors to a friend, thinking I'd simply replace them when I got settled here... I'll re-think that idea because these may be all I need. Oh I know, the Studio engineer-types will be up-in-arms, but, these are that good! Do yourself a favor and try these before you spend a dime on anything else.Of course, most everyone I know with a Home Studio has their favorite set of Cans and these are mine. Audio-Technica delivers the sound and amazon Prime delivers the goods. Recommended.

  These are really fantastic headphones, they sound very good for mostly all music, the bass isn't super strong but beside that, it's really clear. There are 3 different cords included which is nice. The headphones feel sturdy and fold up nicely for storage. If you wanna kick your style up another notch, check out dbrand, where you can buy a variety of skins to customize the headphones how you like. I should also mention the Bluetooth adapter, which adds a nice bit of convenience. It does seem to have a very low hum/interference noise but if you turn the volume of your music up it cannot be heard over it. The battery lasts a reasonably long time (6-8 hours).I've attached a picture of my headphones, customized with a mahogany skin from dbrand, and the Bluetooth adapter is below them.

  I wouldn't consider myself an audiophile mostly because I can't afford the headphones I want, but I do love a great sounding pair of headphones. I have a pair or MrSpeakers Mad Dog headphones with Alphapads (very good headphones) and those are my point of reference for comparing these.The M50s aren't the most comfortable headphones. I would definitely look at changing the ear pads unless it's not an issue for you. The sound quality is really good though and very clear. Different sounds are very distinguishable with the M50s. Bass is there but it's not over powering and they aren't made to be bassy. If you want bass another paid of headphones will do the trick.I bought these mainly for my wife. She listens to music and her audiobooks and she loves them. She uses them at work and the workplace is extremely loud and she says the headphones block out nearly everything on the outside.These are great headphones for the price point and unless you're a serious audiophile you probably won't be disappointed.

  I have never written a review on Amazon, but these headphones are so freaking amazing I had to leave a review; they are the best purchase I have ever made from this site. As many other reviewers have done a fine job of giving these headphones justice, I'll just try to keep this short and simple.Rugged: These headphones have seen a lot of use over four years. I play video games and listen to music often (usually +30 hours a week), tripped over the cord, stepped on them, dropped them, and rolled over them with a chair and the darned things still work the same as they did when I purchased them. The only thing I've had to replace is the earpads, and that is only because they wore out!Amazing sound: My God the audio quality on these is amazing. I went from a Turtle Beach gaming headset to these and I would NEVER go back. I remember it taking a little while to adjust, but once I became used to all the sounds I could hear, my gaming experience and music listening transcended to an new level. FPS games in particular are so much better now that I can clearly hear footsteps and other nuanced noises. My friends didn't believe me when I raved about how good these headphones were, but they finally had an opportunity to use them at a gaming party. They listened to what my games and my music sounded like and immediately bought a pair. Now they, too, will never go back to pleb Turtle Beaches!!Price: Like I said in the beginning, this is the BEST purchase I have ever made on Amazon. The audio quality and durability of these headphones are amazing and well worth the price I paid for them. They sound just as great as when I first purchased them. Kudos to Audio Technica for creating such a great pair of headphones for audiophiles. If these things ever break, I'll definitely be buying another pair.I cannot recommend these enough, especially to those like myself that are looking for the best bang for their buck but still obtaining quality products. They have lasted through four years of abuse and still work as well as the day they arrived. Anyone I have shown these headphones to is impressed by the quality, and you will be too.

  I think the sound quality is very good considering they are bluetooth headphones and the battery life has been good. But I personally find them to be uncomfortable. I cannot wear them for more than an hour because my ears will start to hurt. I work on a computer all day and I like to listen to music while I work so I end up having headphones on for hours at a time. I am not able to do that with these headphones. I have a cheaper pair of Avantree bluetooth headphones that I think are more comfortable and half the price so I'll end up alternating between the two. Overall, great sound quality but you should try putting on a pair before buying them. They might not be a good fit for everyone.

  I have a EVGA Nu Audio on my PC. Tidal with master quality music. These were the least enjoyable headset I have used. My Philips Fidelio L2's beat this as do most other decent headphones that I have tried. The pitch was off, bass seemed distant. Everyone is different at perceiving sound so I recommend giving them a try regardless due to the numerous reviews that are positive. You might really enjoy them and if not just return them until you find a pair you like.

  I am in the market for bluetooth headphones and was excited to see a bluetooth version of M50s which I have had for years now. The wired headphones have held up as the best pair I have owned, and the audio on this wireless set seem just as good.However, one reason I wanted bluetooth headphones was to use with my PC and work computer, but they do not seem to want to pair reliably to either. They work great with my phone, but trying to connect to another device is aggravating, and I have to make sure bt is off on my phone before even making an attempt. But they just flat out won't be detected as an audio device on my Windows 10 PCs, and they keep disconnecting from my Mac. So I am returning them and looking elsewhere.

  I had purchased some Sennheiser HD 598's, I've always been a big fan of Sennheiser......although in this case I was very disappointed in the sonic quality. Distortion was pretty evident at modest listening levels which was bad enough but there was no real bass or warmth to the sound.  So I sent them back for the AT ATH-M50x's.  Love the sound, no issues there at any level of listening.  One irritation.....I do not possess big ears but the ear cups are very snug and occasionally rub my ears.....and they create a fair amount of warmth when wearing them for any period of time longer than 10 minutes or so.  If they could improve that issue they would have a real winner all around.

    Truly Great Headphones
  
",5.0,Bzzzzrrrtt,"Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2016","









  
  
    
  Short Review: These are by far the best headphones that I've owned.  I give them my highest endorsement.  Of course, since you don't know me, my testimony should count for much.Long Review: In an effort to save you some time as you go through the painstaking process of researching quality headphones, I'll direct you to the one other studio (recording) pair that competes with these: 

  
Sony MDR7506 Professional Large Diaphragm Headphone









  
  
    
  .  I have researched Cnet, Amazon, several forums, head-fi.org, and spoken with two studio musician friends, and the 7506s are the only pair that were nearly universally mentioned -- though one or another headphones from the Audio-Technica Mx line are discussed a lot as well.  I've also used the 7506s, and was impressed, but I have yet to compare them to these Audio-Technicas (not that my anecdotal opinion should count for much).  On sound quality alone, my research indicates that the two are very close.  Keep in mind, however, that these are studio headphones, designed to give even responses across all frequencies and accurate tones, so, these are probably not the best gaming (where a large open sound-stage would be preferable for improved surround sound) or base-heavy headphones.I chose the Audio-Technicas over the 7506s for the following reasons: i) I believed (and still do) they produced sound that is at least equal in quality to the 7506s, ii) detachable/replaceable cord, iii) multiple cord (and connector size) options, iv) increased comfort for extended use (larger ear cups with thicker padding), v) low impedance (performs better without an amp, but the 7506 sound quality will improve more when amped), and vi) no exposed cables near the ear cups or head band (the 7506s have an exposed cable that I fear would not survive long in the company of my toddler).One potential negative, especially for studio use, is that these do leak more sound than I was expecting for a closed back, over-ear design.  Also, though they do reduce incoming ambient noise, they are not super noise-isolating.  Since I do not live alone and sometimes have to unexpectedly interact with others, this is a feature that I like.  Also, these are almost twice the cost of the 7506s, so, if you're constrained by a budget, I'd recommend those instead.

  Alright, call me a fake audiophile or yell at me for not appreciating the finer points of music or audio production in the comments, I don't care. The TL;DR is that these surprisingly comfy, sturdy-feeling headphones sounded completely terrible compared to my *actually literally broken* Logitech G430s that I was trying to replace to begin with.Here's what happened:--Put headphones on. Comfy! Can't hear the roommate's baby crying either. Not bad for not having any active noise cancelling.--Plugged headphones in. Confirmed that they were connected. Great! Loving the thick, meaty cord! I bet my cat can't chew through this.--Turned on music. Ooh, the instrumental sounds detailed! It has depth! I can even hear that it's a flat, clippy MP3!--Wait, why hasn't the vocal come in yet.--Has the vocal not come in yet? I hear a choppy noise vaguely in the background---...is that. the vocal?--Proceed to boot up a lossless CD rip of Christopher Tin's ""Waloyo Yamoni"", off of The Drop That Contained The Sea.--WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO VOCALS? IS MY SOUND CARD BROKEN SUDDENLY WHAT??--Last attempt. Turn on Overwatch League livestream. Cannot hear casters over background noise. Bullet and game sounds are so tinny they hurt. This is the worst I've ever heard something sound and I've used the phone-in-bucket method as an impromptu amp before.--Admit defeat, put headphones back in box, plug broken Logitechs back in.I've returned these. Unlistenable mids do not a good experience make. A quick ARAM in League of Legends just sounded tinny and awful in every way too (with in-game voice being downright incoherent), so it's not just audio from bad sources here. I do agree on some points - they do bring out the poorer quality of certain mixes and recording devices, so you'll be able to hear whether compression or clipping or mixing has killed an instrumental track or not REALLY well - but the mids. My god, the mids. If this is ""true sound"" then ""true sound"" is trying to listen to someone who's had a tracheotomy attempting to do ASMR over the top of a Concorde jet mid-takeoff.

  To start off, I really like the way these look. They're visually really cool, the felt fine on my head, though they were too big at their smallest size for my girlfriend. However, there is a constant ticking noise from the left ear cup that never goes away, its really noticeable during slower parts of songs and it drives me insane. On top of that, they didn't sound any better than my girlfriend's skull candy Hesh 3's, which were less than half the price. Overall these were really disappointing especially considering they're over whelming positive reviews and reputation. Couldn't live with the ticking, ended up returning them.

  I had a pair of ATH-M50s for roughly 4 years, before a recent trip to Vegas where they stopped working! (We'll leave that one in Vegas).I use them every day at my home PC for my primary means of sound output. Anywhere from 4-12 hours a day, every day, for four years. They worked perfectly, and these are even better!Bass heavy profile, isolated stage, blocks exterior sound fairly well but not entirely. The M50x has a detachable cable, which may have prevented my M50S from breaking if they had that feature.If I had to make any reccommendations, it would be to source a pair of velour ear pads. They change the sound stage a bit, but reduce the sweat-factor by an order of magnitude.

  Reading all the reviews helped.  These earphones have great sound quality, it has a large range of sounds.  Using it for recording helps you to hear any distinguisable background noise.I use this for gaming, and it has saved me multiple times from dying beecause of hearing sounds that I never heard before from other brands.  (never had one this expensive - but they were decent).  When no music or sound is going through it you can hear some of the background noises, but once you have sounds going people have to yell to get my attention.They do get slighly uncomfortable after a long time, but personally, they feel great and it takes about 2 hours for me to notice that they are starting to hurt.  I usually wear them 4-6 hours before taking them off... and sometimes I just put them around my shoulders and turn the earphones outwards and listen to stuff that way... it is not as loud but you can still hear stuff.

And the foam padding has lost its comfort entirely, if you have ears that stick out more then the average person you will note that these headphones become painful to wear for extended periods of time.

Secondly, the sound quality compared to my (albeit very broken-in) Allen & Heath Xone XD2-53 headphones (which I thought these would be an upgrade for) was night & day. These M50x's are very ""distant"" sounding, all bass, lacking midrange and highs. The vocals are recessed way back, making the songs I'm familiar with sound really different and weird.

  Many of the other five-star reviewers do an excellent job of going into the more technical aspects of these headphones, so I'll just briefly add my voice to the cacophony of praise for these cans:-Audio quality is absolutely superb.  I used to own a pair of regular M50's before breaking them after about a year, and until I finally got around to purchasing these I sorely missed having high-quality headphones.-It absolutely does take some time to burn in these headphones.  Some people say up to 100 hours, but I've noticed a marked improvement in just after 10-20 hours of listening time (I use these almost the entire day at the office).-Having a removable cable, though new to me, is actually a plus as it makes packing the headphone's up much easier.  In the case of actually damaging the cable (fingers crossed that doesn't happen), swapping it out is much easier and there's no risk of rendering the whole unit useless.-Fit is fine.  I have a medium-sized head and have no risk of them sliding off, nor are they too noticeably heavy.-My one gripe remains with build quality, as like the regular M50's the M50x's use a lot of plastic components.  If you will be traveling with these, I highly recommend purchasing a hard travel case, which could save you some heartbreak further down the line.  I recently purchased a Caseling headphones case to avoid just that.And that's it!

  This is my first time A. writing a review and B. buying these kind of headphones. However I'm writing a review just for these headphones because they're just that good. Thus I think an objective list of everything good with it is warranted- good all around frequency response (most of the other headphones I had either were too bassy like gaming headphones or too tiny like open backed consumer grade headphones, so this isn't really saying that much)- Overall Quality. Since this headphone uses Audio jack (both 3.5mm and 1/4"") the drivers can be bigger, and higher quality without needing to save room for a DAC and/or ADC. The one downside is that you're at the mercy of both the cable length (though with a high quality cable it shouldn't be an issue) and the sound device it's plugged into, because the quality then will be the weakest link (historically it'd be the audio device) but it can provide way more control over the Auditory experience-Comfort. The padded ear pieces are something new to be tbh, I have some big ears and a lot of other headsets tend to hurt them because either it's hard plastic, or the cuffs don't compress to accommodate my ears. These A. are pretty big and fit my ears perfectly and B. even when my ears are caught on the edge of the cuffs it's still comfortable-Build quality. The build quality is amazing, as mentioned earlier the cable is really high quality with some pretty heavy duty materials to sheathe it. The whole headset itself is using a combination of high-quality plastics and some rubber in order to make it not only durable, but somewhat flexible and able to survive some drops here and there- Noise dampening. as far as I can tell there is no active noise cancellation on this headphones, and the passive noise cancellation though better than nothing still leave a lot to be desired

  To start, I'm definitely no expert or anything like that. Just a guy that finally had enough of uncomfortable, small,easy to lose and terrible battery earbuds.I work as an Electrician. Have been since I was 15 and I'm 38 now. So I have a ton of experience dealing with every kind of headphone style or earbud style that is on the market. I have gradually spent more for better quality headphones as I get older. And I think I have finally discovered the holy grail for what I am looking for in headphones. I am by no means saying that these are the best in any way or category technically. I have no idea if they are or aren't. Just what my needs and expectations are and how they fit those. I dont need perfection in any category. Just consistency, durability, dependability, ease of every day use, idiot proof Bluetooth pairing that is always fast and smooth, a few special features that are actually something that will be used and the Grand Pubah a BIG MEAN NASTY BAD*** BATTERY.The Audio-Technical ATH-M50BT does all those things but better than even I expected. The sleek matte black color is low key but still cool.The ear pieces are the most comfortable thing I've ever seen or felt. Coming from the earbud life, these feel like you are wearing a giant comfy pillow. I barely know I'm wearing ""cans"" on my ears. Trust me, if you are easy to please and just looking for something that is any level of comfort above buds, this is a grand slam. I give comfort a perfect 10.The Bluetooth works perfectly every single time I flip the switch on the left side ear piece. It's easy to find and slides right over. Volume can be controlled on the headphones or your device. I paired these to my phone originally in seconds and every time after it automatically links to my phone. Boom done. Simple. Bluetooth and controls is a 10.Sound quality is superb for me. I have a Note 9 which has an equalizer option. I had to play with that a small bit at first but if you don't have that option you should be good to go out of the box.Now for the part I hoped was on another level above buds, BASS. I'm a rap fan and, Idk why, but I gots to have my bass. Just what I like. And these beauties have got bass in buckets. The first time I wore them it kinda caught me by surprise. I had no idea how much bass I was getting. To compare it to the best buds I've owned would be like comparing Android to Apple, Android eviscerates an IPhone by a gigantic margin. Sound quality is a 9 and bass is an 11.I've rambled way too long. Look, if you wanna spend just a little bit more than the normal 25-50 bucks you usually spend on some type of headphone and you are a simple person that just needs a dependable long lasting product with pretty good sound quality plus you have had it with nasty earbud falling out of your ear, getting plugged with earwax(don't act like it doesn't happen to you, you ain't gotta lie to kick it) then please I implore you to spend a few more bucks on something you will instantly love and will have for many many years. These headphones are the answer. The perfect answer to your problem. The last headphones you will buy for 10 years or more. I absolutely was not gonna spend basically $200 for this. No way. But I finally did it and I can't describe how furious I'd be if I had been cheap again. I spend a lot of money a year on headphones, but that has been solved. You should also solve your problem, buy this pair of headphones. You can thank me when you write your 5 star review on Amazon. Lol. Enjoy. Thanks for reading this insane review. Peace.

    Excellent headphones for some music, but definitely not a ""flat"" monitor headphone
  
",5.0,Camber,"Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2018","









  
  
    
  I'm rating these headphones 5 stars because they excel in what they do, and the price is arguably a bargain.  However, I must note that these are NOT ""flat"" studio monitor headphones.  I've compared them back to back, numerous times, with a wide variety of music, against the M40X, M70X, R70X, and MSR7.  All of these other Audio-Technica headphones have a more neutral sound than the M50X; the M50X sounds notably more ""scooped,"" with strong bass, sizzling highs, and more hollowed and recessed sound across the mids and mid-highs.  This sound profile makes the M50X sound exciting and enjoyable with some music, but less suitable for other music; for example, compared to the other headphones I listed, the M50X isn't the best choice for vocals, acoustic instruments, and pop music which has already been mixed with scooped sound.In the end, there's no such thing as a ""perfect"" headphone, since the sound that reaches our ears involves interaction between the headphones and how each piece of music has been recorded and mixed.  The best scenario is to have several good headphones, and choose the headphone which you find best suits each piece of music.  I think the M50X can have a place in such a collection of headphones, but the M50X wouldn't be my choice if I could have only one headphone.Here is a brief comparison of the other headphones I listed versus the M50X:- The M40X is more neutral overall, and probably a better choice overall than the M50X for a wide variety of music.- The M70X is *much* clearer and flatter than the M50X, with more accurate and realistic detail.  The M70X lacks a bit of bass for some music, but modest EQ can fix that when needed.  Overall, I like the M70X considerably more than the M50X overall.- The R70X has a more spacious sound due to being open back, and also has more detail and more accurate highs than the M50X, while also being less fatiguing than the M50X.- The MSR7 is a better headphone than the M50X for most music.  The MSR7 sort of finds the middle ground among all of the other headphones I listed.  The bass is less than M50X, comparable to the R70X and M40X, and a little more than the M70X.  The quality of the details and highs is better than the M50X and M40X, comparable to the R70X (though not as smooth as the R70X), and not as good as the M70X.

  The cable that was included with the headphones was not of high quality. I had to wiggle the cable to get it in the perfect position or else the sound would only come out of one headphone. When I replaced the cable with a higher-quality one, the results were fantastic. I've always enjoyed AudioTechnica's products and this one kept up to my expectations. I highly recommend these headphones if you want great sound quality without emptying your wallet.

    Beware of audio jack!
  
",1.0,Minh Vuong,"Reviewed in the United States March 13, 2019","









  
  
    
  Sound quality is good but the headphone jack is made cheaply and the tip WILL break, sooner or later (4-5 months for me). The tip became lodged into my laptop and that took me hours to get out. Then when I go buy a replacement online (audio jack size 2.5mm to 3.5mm), I found out that it is incompatiable with the headphones. Audio Technica's audio jack has grooves that allows it to fit right into the headphones. Thus, Audio Technica requires a very specific audio jack that only they produce, which they overcharge you for - a whole $20! The entire situation just sounds like audio technica is intentionally selling me cheaply made wiring so I have to go replace it every 3-6 months even when I take care of it really well. I don't think I will every buy another audio technica now that I know their sale strategy - the only reason the headphones is relatively cheap themselves is because you'd have to spend $20 every few months to ""upkeep"" it.

  The headphones are great for everything. Quality is fantastic, comfort is wonderful. But I'm going to give it a negative review because I found that they are incredibly easy to break if you accidentally get the wire caught on something when you have to move your head with them on. There is an extremely cheap piece of plastic that keeps the ear pieces from swiveling away from your ear. I included the part that I am referring to in the image. That broke off on the right side of my headset because I had gotten the wire caught on my arm chair and it jerked the a bit.If that breaks, the headset is ultimately unusable as it won't fit on your head. The only cheap $0.50 piece that is ESSENTIAL in keeping the headset fitting for your head is the piece that will most likely break and make your $130 headset unusable. Come on guys. The product is made in Taiwan though I guess I shouldn't be surprised. Tried to use the warranty but constantly had issues with customer support.

  Whether it's for music, gaming, or casual enjoyment of audio, these headphones have exceptional clarity and south. Bought them on a whim primarily for gaming but have been enjoying listening to music, as well. Every detail is crisp is smooth, soothing to my audiophile's delight.In terms of comfort, they take a little getting used to and you may need to adjust their positioning a little. Once you have it sorted out, they're superb for hours on end.

  I replaced a corded set of headphones that I was in love with (never mind the brand, I dropped them once, they broke and I was mad even though it was my fault). I was leery on trying the ATH-M50x headphones but in all honesty - I shouldn't have been. They are comfy for continued music listening, they are not too heavy that they are annoying, I use them with a bluetooth base from my PC and the range is excellent (even in a machine shop). I was very pleased with the battery life and the charging time. I hope you are as happy with yours as I am with mine.

    Good, but replacement parts are lacking.
  
",4.0,Lamp-post,"Reviewed in the United States May 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  It's really good, but the ear enclosures start to degrade after a couple years. Which wouldn't be a problem, but the last time I looked into replacing them, the company doesn't offer this models ear enclosures. Rather, they only offered the previous models ear enclosures, which were not as nice. So, the noise cancellation has severely suffered.If you get these, I'd suggest that you look to find ear replacements at the same time; so, you don't have to worry about it in the future. (I think it was either the lotion I was using or just my normal skin oil that quickened the degradation process, because only the side that touched my skin is degraded. So, that's another thing to take into consideration.)

  For ""high fidelity"" audio, the build is extremely cheap. I was a faithful AudioTechnica customer,  loyal even. I wouldn't dare taint my ear holes with chinesium and cheap BPA full plastics. I raved about AudioTechnica to everyone and anyone. Not anymore, for the arh-m50x either has faulty wiring or impedance issues that cause all noise to shift to the left side of the headphones. The sound quality changes more sporadically than a cleptomaniac with ADHD at Kohls. I spent nearly  $200 on a god forsaken lemon, and I can't even have lemonade.

    For the bass lovers worried that ""Professional Studio Monitors"" means ""Tinny, flat, and only for audiophiles""
  
",5.0,Tommy Martin,"Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2016","









  
  
    
  I’m no audiophile but I love music. I'm not a professional, I'm just a casual listener with a huge passion for music. I tend to be a bit of a bass head, my go-to genre regardless of mood or setting is rap (Logic is my fav). Other reviews do an excellent job of pointing out the extensive qualities of these headphones (they are super comfortable, the detachable cables are great, they are the best sounding headphones for their price, ect), so I am going to focus on just the bass. If you have the same taste for rap/bass-heavy music, listen up: the bass won’t blow you away. You aren’t going to feel like you’re in the club with the subs banging your head around. But the bass is definitely there, and these by no means sound tinny or empty. It’s not a low level of bass because of cheap drivers, it’s a low level of bass from careful balancing of the eq. It’s a cleaner and clearer bass than I have ever heard from any other headphones. And ""cleaner and clearer"" does not mean quiet or subdued. Even the lowest end frequencies come through plenty loud. But it doesn't mindlessly boost any bass to overpower the rest of the sound, it instead balances it well with the rest of the song. After a few minutes listening to the M50-x’s I couldn’t go back to my Sony extra bass headphones. While you may get more oomph from other cans you won’t touch the quality or clarity of these.So ultimately, like everything else related to music, it comes down to personal preference. If you want quantity of bass over quality of bass these aren’t for you. For better or for worse (in my opinion better), these are no Beats. But as a bass lover myself, I cannot recommend these enough. In my opinion the quality of the bass far outweighs the tendency towards a flat eq.I hope this helps!

",5.0,Cristian Panora,"Reviewed in the United States December 17, 2015","









  
  
    
  If you are a true audiophile and love to hear rich sounds within the music and other media than these headphones are a must for the listener. i ordered my pair through Amazon and it has been delivered quick, in a little of three days or less. Now these headphones are very durable and can maintain it's original form always. I've had these headphones for over a year and they look perfect as just out the box(mainly bc i like to keep my stuff neat and safe). they are quite flexible, though i do not recommend twisting them. They may feel delicate, but it is well crafted and well made with good material for everyday use. The headphone fits perfect and is not to tight, but almost relaxing to wear. however, the cups around the ear may get your ears warm and feel hot, nothing bad but noticeable. It also comes with three cables of different lengths which is pretty nice and useful, it also includes a carrying pouch, not very useful as a hard shell case, but almost like a shield from being scratched. Now the sound is excellent, which is why i write this review. With these headphones, you hear a song perfectly, the sound is rich and even hear sounds not hearable in other headphones. i mainly listen to classical songs like the Beatles, Queen, Elvis Presley, etc and with Audio Technica ATH-M50x the song is only more pleasing to listening, Not just songs but also, anything you can listen to and you notice the details and fluent sounds. However, they do not have much base as beats or V-Modas but base is perfect as it is, hip-hop and R&B can be enjoyed excellent. Finally, these headphones are a must get, they are worth more than 5 stars, just to good. But do keep in mind they are studio monitor headphones, mainly used in computer for editing, this is nothing to worry about at all, as they offer great quality sound to the listener.

    M50x + Antlion ModMic 5 Combo Review
  
",4.0,Cem G.,"Reviewed in the United States September 11, 2017","









  
  
    
  I am using these headphones as my daily drivers when I am playing games, listening music or talking with my friends on Discord. I previously had HyperX Cloud Gaming Headset but I wanted better quality mic with a better headphone and found out M50x's does great job when paired with Antlion Modmic. I listen music all the time in the background, even if I am talking with my friends or playing a game so sound quality is really important for me. The other important thing was comfort since I am planning to use my headset for at least 5 hours a day.Sound (5/5)They sound really good and have a flat-neutral sound signature. It is very well balanced. All around really good sound signature where bases don't overwhelm the mids and highs are very clear. This is a closed back headphone so sound stage is not phenomenal or cannot even be compared to an open back headphone but as most people would say these are probably the best budget monitor headphones on the market right now. Compared to my old Cloud's their reaction is better in mids and highs, where bass feels similar.Build Quality (4.5/5)Like a tank, very well build with solid frame but I think in the future I might see some problems with the plastic parts used as hinges where it allows you to rotate the earpiece of the headset. I am not saying that they will brake but they will probably get looser in time and not hold as firm as it is now. All around very solid build.Comfort (3/5) [Edited]UPDATE: After trying Brainwavz Ear Pads, I am raising my comfort rating to 4/5. Now it feels like Over-Ear kind of headphones which I prefer to On-Ear. Size is a lot better compared to stock (original) ear pads. Glasses are not an issue anymore. On a side note bass now feels distant which makes sense since distance between my ears and headphone speakers increased with Brainwavz Ear Pads.Not good. I am wearing glasses and I can safely say that these ear pads are not designed for prolonged use with glasses. I start feeling discomfort after an hour with these headphones. Headband is really comfortable but the ear region of this headset have 2 problems. First one is the material used in the ear pads and the second one is the size of the ear pads. They are small in size and lacks the cushiony feel I had with my HyperX Cloud's. They are small for my ears (I can say I have average sized ears) and my ears can feel the pressure of the ear pads since it is more like On-Ear than Over-Ear kind of headphone with original ear pads. Additionally ear pads are not cushioned enough and my glass frame hurts the back of my ears because of that. For these problems I bought replacement ear pads from Brainwavz for $22.50 and I will update the review once I receive them. M50x's get 3 out of 5 from me compared to my previous Cloud I Gaming Headset having 4.5/5 in terms of comfort.Antlion ModMic Combo ReviewThey work really well with this headphone as long as you put the adhesive base clasps properly. The way Antlion advertise on their website (https://antlionaudio.com/products/modmic-5) using these headphones is not it is supposed to be attached. The problem with their way is that you can't put the mic on base clamp pointing upwards due to headphone's removable connector. Trust me I tried before removing and attaching the adhesive base again to the way can be seen from the photos. Hope it helps. Sorry for photos but can't seem to find a way to rotate them.

  Ive owned these headphones for about three years not, they have been through hell and back, and have long since surpassed my expectations. After these past three years of very heavy useage (the white pair that i have at least) have become dirty on the inside of the ear cups from sweat and skin oils, but are no worse for wear, while the ear padding and headband have started to slowly flake away but are still as comfotable as the day i bought them. The cables are also fantastic quality, only recently has the short straight cable broken (my absolute favorite 😢), and it was entirely my fault as i always got it caught on things by accident, and the end that connects to my phone just disconnected from the plug slowly over time, but three years of abuse, and these have barely flinched, so if you are hesatant to buy these headphones because youre afraid of breaking them, dont be, trust me they can take the abuse.

  The M50x did not meet my expectations for this price point. Compared to the M40x, while the bass was a tad bit more present, the highs and mids (especially the mids) did not blend well overall. Because of this, I'd rather stick with the M40x for better sound balance and clarity, or even the ~$10 Panasonic RPHJE120K/ 125 earbuds for more bass. In my experience, I'd recommend the M40x for casual listening, or some other brand of headphones for long listening sessions or gaming because these Audio-Technica headphones will clamp and cause discomfort for your ears.

  I own another cheaper pair of Audio Technica headphones and am impressed with the sound for the money, that's why I decided to try these. They are good headphones for price but honestly I expected better performance at this price level. The sound is good and 'Accurate', but If you are looking for Great Base these are not the ones, the base is only 'good', I was looking for ""Accurate"" and these Are Accurate, though at high volumes they distort, but so do other even more expensive headphones at those volumes. On my system they begin to distort a little at just beyond 50% volume and would be noticeable to Anyone at 70% volume. I have Sony MDRs that I purchased around 1990 that don't begin to distort till around 70% volume but I wanted to replace those old things. I sent these back. Looking for better.

  I tested the senheiser 598, ath ad900x, Sony mdr7506, & these. These were a good middle ground of all of them. Loved the brightness & detail & price of the Sony’s, but didn’t like the cheap flimsy-ness, & the non existent clamp of the headband......Liked the detail, open sound stage, build quality, & comfort of the senheisers, didn’t like the light clamp, & just couldn’t justify $200 for them.....the ath900xs was just bizarre, very very light, “air” is an apt product line name for them, like the soundstage and detail. But lacked any low end punch. & unless you have a pumpkin sized head they slide down your head to where the tops of your ears are holding the weight of them. Even with trying the zip tie mod on the “wings”. If they’d increase tension in the wings I might have chosen them. So went with the hated m50xs. Ignored at 1st because of all the bad reviews/opinions. But they were in my price range so I thought I’d try them. I personally feel they took most of the good outta all these. Good clamp, but can be uncomfortable after awhile. I have a small slender head so I can see how melon headed ppl would not like them. Good detail, but not great. Good punch but not muffled. Needs a little eq for my taste. Very hot. Detachable plug which is nice, however both these and the senheisers have notched plugs so you turn the plug, then pull. Which to me defeats the purpose of having a removable plug. I thought it was for if you got the cable tangled on something & stood up, it wouldn’t tear the cord, it’d jus pull free. I guess mabey easier for transporting. All in all, for the price I’m happy with them.easy to drive. Big sales so parts are available, highly modifiable.....on a side not it cost me around $20 to send the other 3 back, even with prime. So keep that in mind if auditioning. Also the ad900xs I got from a camera place in jersey mabey? And took forever to get here to Las Vegas. I watched them through package tracking & they kicked around Jersey for a week before being shipped, then suddenly was here. I’ll probably not order anything that far away again. Anyway that’s my 2 cents. For this price range for closed backs, get them.

    Best Wireless Headphones to Date
  
",5.0,Zachery,"Reviewed in the United States December 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  These are easily the best wireless headphones I have used to date. The battery life is amazig, easily lasting through 30 hours of active use before needing to be charged. I usually charge them for 30 min to 1 hour per day, but that's really not necessary - just dead battery paranoia from other devices. The sound quality is great, coming in slightly under the Sennheiser HD 599 SE's, mainly due to their less spacious sound stage. That's to be expected, though, as these are close backed, where the Sennheisers are open back. The pads are quite comfortable unless I get warm, but it does take a bit of fiddling to find the right setting to balance the clamping force. I can easily wear these headphones for 10+ hours with little to no pain or fatigue in my ears. They are also able to easily connect to multiple computers and my phone with no issue remembering each device, so no need to re-pair them every time I switch. They can be used while charging, though I wouldn't recommend it, both because I haven't checked whether that might damage them, and because the one time I tried it there was a significant loss of sound quality (poorly isolated ground, maybe?). The one thing I would wish for is an updated version with USB-C charging instead of micro USB, as I would rather carry fewer cables.

",5.0,Richard,"Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2020","I owned a pair of the original M50x, bought these as a replacement after they were stolen and was excited that they added Bluetooth functionality, until I used the Bluetooth functionality.
Overall these are good, but the Bluetooth is abysmal (see the bad), and strikes me as an afterthought in the design.
Considering how much cheaper the ATH-M50x's (not-BT) are, I'd say go for the other pair.

The good:
-Very clean, symmetrical design with relatively minimal branding. These are the best looking ""audiophile"" headphones.
-Comfortable to wear for hours on-end.

-Superb sound quality, after having these $20 earbuds just don't cut it anymore.

-Buttons on the left ear-cup make it easy to tell left from right without having to look at the headphones.

-Battery life is good, with minimal use it usually lasts me about a month.

-The cable, this one is better than the original M50s, both ends are 3.5mm and the whole cable can be replaced by any ol' aux cable in a pinch.

-Noise-cancellation is good, you can still hear the outside world but it's quieter, sometimes I wear these just to hush things.

The bad:
-There's an audible high-pitched whine/hiss/screeching when Bluetooth is on, this made my ears ring after a while and I try to avoid using it, which sucks because its the main feature I bought them for.

-Range for Bluetooth is awful. Works fine if you carry your phone in a breast-pocket but otherwise cuts out.

-Bluetooth of this low-quality is NOT worth an additional $50, I don't know what they were thinking.

-I don't see why the included 3.5mm cable needs a button/mic on it since the headphones already have both built into the ear-cup, I wish they'd spend that manufacturing cost on a better Bluetooth radio.

-I live in the damp pacific-northwest and have noticed some rusting around the right ear-cup, this could also be from sweat but it's notable regardless.

-They are HOT to wear when doing anything physical, or in the heat.",Color: BlackStyle: Wireless

I'm not hugely a fan of the cord that came with them, as the TRRS connector causes some issues with my computer's audio output. I'm not certain whether that's a common issue, but it's there. The cord works fine when hooked up to my Fiio E10k.

  The sound quality was poor, there was to much static sound from the speakers when listening to someone is talking or music is playing. Even for DJ'ing it has poor sound quality. In addition the sound isn't sharp and the bass is non existent. The speakers for the price point are just far to low quality as well, the foam pads developed a crack in less than a week of use. They are primarily plastic, while some plastic are very firm and feel sturdy. The plastic feels cheap and like it could break easily. I was hope to no have to get an expensive replacement for my older sennheiser pro headphones but looks like I'll still have to. I had a pair of audiotechnicas from a programmer friend and they worked great but these were just awful.

  Many reviews make these headphones seems like they are the absolute best. They're a solid choice, but don't be fooled into thinking you're going to have a euphoric listening experience.I'm an audio hobbyist and have experience with some moderately nice car audio SQ gear and have made some nice home audio speakers as well. So those experiences alter my perspective of what good music can sound like and the experience it can give you. You won't get that from these headphones, but they are still nice. I use them pretty much every day on my computer. If I want to have a fun listening experience I go to my living room or car.

  You of course get the great quality M50 headphones, and the sound quality is AMAZING when plugged directly in.  Hands down the best clarity I've ever gotten from any cans.  I've had multiple pairs of Sony, the top end Status Audio over-ear phones, and these blow those away.  The bluetooth connection seems to be a bit fuzzy (when there's nothing playing, almost like a faint white-noise), but I can't attribute that to the headphones, as I've only tried them with my phone.  But you don't notice it when anything is playing.  No issues when plugged in directly.  I would definitely recommend these if you are thinking about purchasing a set.

It is not so narrow that it is suffocating, but if you enjoy a large soundstage, look elsewhere. If you enjoy your music pure and neutral sounding with the bass, midrange and treble each getting their moments in the sun, these headphones are for you. I have these hooked up to an iFi headphone amp at the 2:00 setting and they are perfect for me, as I enjoy a bit of honey like warmth to my music.

For example, hearing crickets and katydids throughout Ghosts 36 and at about the 1:00m mark, a TV or feint talking.  It sounds like reznor is sitting at a piano with the mic set up outside.Every other experience has been great!  I also listen a lot to Christ Whitley.  It's amazing how you can virtually hear a foot tap that you never knew was in the songs.  You can even tell which direction his head turns from the mic when he sings.

The sound is crystal clear and everything is balanced. I just received these 2 hours ago and cannot set them down. The bass is rich and I can hear every little detail of each song that I listen to.

I am a fan of the headphones design, these are the first headphones that do not hurt or irritate my ear after long use with my glasses. I am especially a fan of the headphones having a cable lock system to ensure the cable isn't unplugged from the headphones at random.The only negative about these heads phones is that after a long period of use the headphones make a loud crackle noise but I believe it may just be these headphones or a issue with my microphone.

  Wow. What is there to say, other than you're getting a quality pair of studio headphones that are acceptable for daily use in just about everything. My main reason for getting these was because I needed a pair of over the ear headphones for work that would isolate me and block out more noise since my company's office has an open floor plan.Whether I'm at work coding and working on things while jamming out to music, or if I'm home watching videos, playing video games, or even playing guitar with these plugged into my amp (so I don't disturb neighbors or my girlfriend); they just work. These worked as expected, came with 3 cables, and the audio quality is TOP NOTCH. Trust me, as someone who used to just buy Beats/SkullCandy or whatever was the latest ""Gaming Headset"", the sound quality here is amazing. It took me a little while to adjust, but now nothing compares with the crisp and clear sound that these put out. I've found myself enjoying bands I didn't use to like, noticing sounds in games that I never noticed before and so much more!Buy them. Totally worth the $150 price tag, but if you can get them for cheaper - you'd be foolish not to grab these.

  With the date of this review, I will have owned these wonderful headphones for 2 years, 9 months, 1 week, and 5 days. Back when I bought these, had previously gone though a multitude of various headphones that would be suitable for daily use while I worked. None of them lasted and I was always dis-satisfied with the audio quality. I finally did some hardcore research and found these beauties.When I first started using them, I was not a fan of how they felt on my head. I figured, well, maybe I just needed to break them in a little bit and they should hopefully get comfy. Glad I did! A week or two after purchase, they were snug and comfy on my head. I could easily wear them for my entire work day which wasn't less than 9 hours.Audio quality. I was blown away that headphones could have this rich of sound. However, it also depends on the quality of the music/sound/etc you are listening too. Honestly, listening to anything from streaming from Youtube to uncompressed FLAC files sound excellent. They're not kidding when they say these are ""studio monitor headphones."" They mean business.If you're checking out the pictures I have attached, you'll see that the earcup leather is FINALLY showing wear and tear. Like I said, I've used these daily for almost three years, at work and at home for gaming and video editing. Beyond that, the sound quality has not diminished. The sound is just as rich and full ad the day I got them.The reason I'm writing this review after so many years? To show a testament to how great these things are, and because I'm picking up another pair to keep at work, and keep my current pair at home. I love these darn things so much that I really felt compelled to review them.Audio-Technica... Thank you for these headphones.

  This is perhaps one of the best headphones I've ever had. Sound is well defined across between bass, mids and highs and it can be loud, not that it focus on doing that, but it has a really good volume.One major, gigantic disadvantage is that none of the cables that come with it have phone controls or mic, and the connector is proprietary on the headphone, meaning no 3.5 to 3.5 cable with a control and mic could fill that gap. As such, it is useless to take calls.But if you're just in the ""listening"" portion, it is hard to get anything better than this at this price range.

  Anyone who is serious about audio knows that these are some of the best headphones on the market, ESPECIALLY for the price. As with any piece of professional equipment, making sure they are properly set up is important. Being flat response, they have to be EQ’d in order to sound their best. Out of the box, they will sound a bit trebly and airy. But when you dial in the proper EQ, you’ll find that these can take a BEATING. I love using these headphones for video editing and mixing because they will give you the truest representation of what you’re hearing. People who borrow them can’t believe the sound quality and how dynamic they are. They can also be folded to be compact in a bag. The only negative I can think of is that they can feel a bit plastic-y. Not to say they are cheaply constructed, but if they were stepped on or bent the wrong way, I could see them running the risk of snapping, specially near the ear pieces. All in all, these were the last pair of professional headphones I’ve purchased (almost 3 years ago) and I haven’t looked back. I laugh to myself when people try to tell me their Beats or Sony’s are better. You won’t find better headphones for the price.

Unfortunately for me, after very short use I started experiencing sharp pain in my ears due to the super sharp and crisp sound which lead to permanent tinnitus in both ears. For the most part I was pretty careful with the volume I listened at and kept it at no more than 60%. If you're not accustom to high end headphones like I wasn't, I suggest slowly easing in to it and let your ears get accustom to the new sound quality.

  ) and they were finally starting to give out. The Sony headset was actually quite nice. One of the few problems I had with it was that inside the earcups, there was not enough space for my ears.The M50x completely fixes this problem. There is ample amount of space for your ear. I've done some 2-3 hour gaming sessions and it's been completely solid. You'll most likely forget that they are on. As others have mentioned, if you are in a warmer space, since these are completely over the ear, you might have some sweaty ears (this hasn't been the case for me so far).My favorite thing has been listening to songs that I've listened to dozens of times before. The same song will give you a new experience as the headphones bring out the minute details. It sort of ruins other speakers and headphones experience from the standpoint of not hearing the same amount of details.My only complaint is that the headband could use a little more padding. I found that if you get the headphones adjusted for your head, the weight of the headphones distributes nicely across your ears and the top of your head.

Great bluetooth range means that every time I try to turn them on, they pair with my iPad.

I was sceptical at first, but my kid is pretty good at researching the things he can not buy with his own allowance and giving justifiable and logical reasons for wanting/needing something normally out of the question. He pretty much had me convinced, but I called my best friend who is a professional drummer and teacher to make sure- ""Are these really worth the price?"" He immediately said absolutely and that they would serve him well and for a long time. Long story short, on the day they arrived, after my son had finished gushing over them, he let me give them a try. Wow! I have never enjoyed listening to music or movies with headphones, but I can't seem to live without these now- yes, I loved them so much my bestie got me a pair of my own for Christmas. These are remarkably comfortable so no issues with using them for an extended length of time and the sound is crisp and clear over a range of really loud or really soft music, it's easy to focus on a single instrument while enjoying a song- I even love these for movie and tv watching on my laptop- also, audio books are amazing now. I never knew what difference quality headphones can make. A bargain at twice the price, as they say. They're the best headphones I've ever used, period. Audio-Technica has earned a lifelong customer- well, maybe two, as my son is absolutely in love with his own pair as well.

  These headphones provide exactly what I expected. Excellent sound quality, pretty comfortable to wear, even for long periods of time, and the interchangeable cables are great for whatever length you need at the time. I've had these for about 9 months now and they continue to be my daily headphones. For reference, I listen to music ~5 hours/day.I will mention that I replaced the original earcups with the Shure HPAEC840 ear cups as those are a little thicker. My ears would press against the hard plastic on the inside of the earphone but these thicker ear pads helped with that.Do I wish it came with a hard case? Yes. Is the soft pouch good enough for carrying them around? Yes.Sound quality: 9/10Build quality: 9/10Comfort: 8/10 - Made better (for me anyway) with the new ear cups.

  These are my sixth pair of headphones and are making me wish I had just bought these to begin with.  Let me start by explaining what I wanted from a set of headphones.  As strange as this may sound, sound quality was not my primary interest.  My hearing is not that good and sound separation for me is a concept not a reality.  That said, things sound way, way better with these headphones than anything else I’ve tried.  I wanted a good quality headphone with great battery life and a comfortable over the ear fit.  Secondly, I wanted them with Bluetooth that would pair easily and allow me to range away from the source without dropping the playback. Finally, they needed to fold up for travel and be adaptable to iPhone, iPad, PC, TV, ETC.This is the first set of headphones I’ve owned that do all those things and do it well.  The sound actually has separation that I can hear!  The battery life is fantastic and the recharge time is short.  I can also use them corded if I wish.  I can leave my iPad in one end of the house and they still play just fine in the other end of the house without dropping the playback.  Comfort!  Comfort is different for each individual.  This is the first set of headphones that are actually comfortable for me.  I did replace the ear pads with a set of aftermarket pads that another reviewer recommended, and it made all the difference in the world.  I wear glasses and there is no pressure on them at all. The headband is the right width, and the pads fit entirely over/ around my ears.  I’ve worn these for eight hours straight and they were still comfortable!  My ears didn’t feel pressured, they didn’t get hot or numb, I actually can forget I’m even wearing them.  They also fold up and will pack nicely in my suit case and appear to be quite sturdy in construction.  The noise canceling works also.  When I’m listening to a video or to music, I hear no outside noise at all.  I’m sure that is in part due to my hearing, but they do work better at canceling out room noise Than any of my other pairs did.So, all things considered I couldn’t be happier with this set of headphones.  For me and my needs they are awesome.

  These headphones are a big upgrade compared to my previous headphones. The sound quality is drastically different, but it's most likely due to using the other pair of headphones for years. These headphones feels great and can wear them all day without feeling like your ears are being crushed. Definitely has great noise cancellation and they keep all the audio from exiting the headphones. I couldn't hear anyone knocking my door with these on. I'm using it to play my games and it works just fine. My only minor issue with these headphones is that the bass feels like it doesn't exist.In my opinion, I feel like it's worth it for what I paid for it. Not bad for a pair of under $200 headphones. Again, the only thing this thing is missing is some good bass.

    Sound quality that I prefer
  
",4.0,Jamazons,"Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2019","









  
  
    
  I am a casual listener. Unwinding with music at the end of the day helps me get through each day of stress and hardships. I had been using the earbuds that came with my phone, wired AKG tuned earbuds by Samsung, which were just fine and I liked them a lot. Unfortunately, the right earbud stopped working and so I was stuck with only the left side and decided it's time to shop for a headphone because Samsung does not sell those any longer. Because smartphones are slowly getting rid of the audio jack, I wanted to get a wireless headphone so I can continue to use it with future phones, but as much as I would have loved to buy the new Sony WH-1000XM3, anything over $200 is a bit too much for me. So after doing some research, I came down to the TaoTronics TT-BH060 (was for $49) and the Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT (on sale for $149). Here is what I noticed when using the two headphones... (both come with bluetooth 5.0, which is nice)- Both are fairly comfortable for me. Maybe because the Taotronics are less expensive, I feel less worried about future wear and tear. The Audio-Technica ear cups are softer and more plushier... which up to each individual is a good or bad thing, but that doesn't mean the Taotronics are hard or uncomfortable.- Audio-Technica definitely wins in the sound quality department in my opinion, which would make sense considering the cost. Listening to the Taotronics afterward gave me a headache. It has a more thumping/muddy/enclosed sound to it compared to the clean spacious bass and clear vocals on the Audio-Technica. That being said, I was fine with the sound quality from the Taotronics before I heard Audio Technica... just a noticeable difference that I found between the two.- Less sound leak on the Taotronics. I was actually surprised at how much sound leaked from the Audio Technica, and was a bit disappointed... but it wasn't so bad to return it.I can't say much about the button controls, build, or battery life, but from the amount of time I've had them, I'd say they're both pretty good in those areas. Ultimately, the sound of the Audio Techinca won me over the Taotronics.

  Transitioning from a cheap and mainstream headphones, I would describe the experience as ""three dimensional"". My jaw dropped for the first 10 minutes when I played Overwatch - the laser sizzling, metals making clanking sounds, even the sound of Mccree smoking a cigar were heard for the first time. This headphone truly brings the sound effects to another level. Felt like I was playing the game in a movie theater.Moderate bass, very clear treble, no muffling in mid range. Very comfortable even with thick glass frames.Tested with different songs, but the quality difference with 30-40 USD headphones are not as noticeable. To me, the headphone added more realism and clarity for games than music.

  I admit, I love the sound, and I wish that was the end of the story.  It's inconceivable that they would choose to make the 3.5mm connection hole so small, that the majority of standard cables will not fit.

  No complaints about these. They're comfortable (though a little tight initially), and come with two high quality cables. Perfect desk headphones for work.

  These Headphones are crazy awsome. I've worn them all day without Irritation etc. They are extremely comfortable. When you have them on the music is very clear. If you're looking for a headset for music with alot of base you might want to get something else as in V-modas, but if you are normal like me and listen to music with lyrics these headphones will make you jizz your pants from excitement. They seem to be very loud when you have them on, but once you take them off to see if other people can hear your music you'll notice you cant hear a thing. When i had bought this product it was on sale for $130 i was kinda regretting it expecting terrible headphones, but once I received them I was amazed by how great they were. If you want over-ear Beats by Dre suck up your ego and go with these. They are ALOT cheaper and have way better music quality. Another great thing with these is that I can use them as a speaker for when i sleep. I would just turn out the thingys and turn the music volume all the way and it will act as a speaker. I'm not sure if it'll damage the headphones (they prob will), but i don't care i love music and i got no speakers so yeah.

  I originally purchased this item in black a few years back, and they were the best headphones that I had. They beat out my old pair of Sony headphones, as well as the Beats Studio 2.0 headphones. When the headphones got damaged (entirely my fault), I decided to get a new pair in white (this product). They’re the exactly the same, as I’d expected.For sound quality, these headphones are clear, and very well balanced. They’re not muddy like the Beats, and I use them daily for gaming, video editing, and a lot of music listening (EDM and hip hop). As for build quality, my pair has been dropped a few times, and I can’t tell. The paint isn’t chipped anywhere, the hinges perform exactly the same, they’re incredible comfortable to wear for longer periods of time, and the earcups sure help with that. But the earcups aren’t only comfortable, they do a really good job with canceling out background noise. Not the best job, my Beats had actual noice cancellation, but still come second place despite not having actual noice cancellation technology.

  I was disillusioned when I returned the Sony 1000 XM3s. They were kind of my last hope, I thought, to find a pair of Bluetooth cans with the sound quality I wanted. The Bose QC series was a little muddy for me, and it turned out that the Sonys, while fantastic at NR, had a similar problem. I tried the M50xBT after reading some online reviews, and WOW! I can hear every track. There is just enough punch in the bass, and the mids and highs are so clean. I hadn't even thought about going with non-NR headphones, but the seal is quite good, and nothing much gets through. Seriously, if you have been disappointed with bluetooth headphones because of audio quality, give these a try. They don't look quite as good, but I don't really care. They sound fantastic, and in the end that is what I wanted.

    Weird power saving + pops and crackles when nothing is playing
  
",1.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States June 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  The sound of these is great. But everything else I have issues with. The headband in particular is not very comfortable, with VERY little padding. The cuffs are not great, and aren't really big enough. They press really hard against my head, which is good I guess if you need to block out a lot of sound, but I don't. It just makes these more uncomfortable.But the biggest issue is that it has some sort of power saving feature where if it's not being sent music for a while, it goes to sleep. So if you get a short sound or something, like a Discord notification? Oops, guess you just don't get to hear that, sorry. Oh even for normal music and whatnot, if it's been in sleep mode, here's a delay for you while it wakes up.Oh, and I get these pops and crackles every now and then if music isn't going, which makes these very unpleasant to use. I think it's again the power saving thing. And I know it's not my setup, because I had another pair of headphones before this that had no issues.I was going to give this like a 3 star, but no, no. In everything except sound quality specifically, my old $50 pair beats out this nearly $200 pair. That should not happen.

  I own a Bose ae2 pair, used Sony MDRXB950BT for a year and half, tried Bose QC35 for 14 days and bought these a week ago. Without a doubt these are the best sounding headphones out of all of the above.Here is my honest comparison of these headphones with all of the various headphones I have used so far.COMFORT : Even though these headphones are not too heavy, they do exert a lot of clamping force around my jaw area. I use my headphones at work and commute daily (around 4-6 hours daily), and my jaw tends to hurt after 3 to 4 hours of listening and I have to remove them for 15 min before I could wear them again. I will wait for another week or two to see if it gets better. Out of all the headphones I owned and used - BOSE ae2s are the most comfortable.  I used them for 6-8 hours straight on some days and didn't feel any pressure around my jaw, ever.BUILD QUALITY: These headphones have very good build quality. The head band is quite flexible and the headphones look like they will last the daily abuse of commuting. Compared to Bose ae2 and Sony, these seems as good if not better than them in this department.MUSIC and SOUND QUALITY: This is where these headphones blow away every other pair of headphones I owned. I am not an audiophile at all,  but I do listen to various genres of music 4-6 hours daily and I can confidently say that these headphones are amazingly clear and have very balanced tones. Don't expect too much bass like MDRXB950BT though.PRICE: I got them for $130 on amazon and they are worth every damn penny.CONCLUSION: one of the best sounding headphones that one can buy for <$150, provided that you can bear the discomfort from long listening sessions.

I'd also like to point out that whether you've got these hooked up to a desktop computer, mobile phone, or home theater amp, they always sound great.

  I bought these a number of months back.  I wanted a high fidelity last set of headphones and that was pretty much what I got.  These are most comparable to studio monitors in their reproduction, with response that is very flat.  You can eq them into whatever sound profile you most enjoy if you are more of a bass-head or whatever as they have no issues reproducing any frequency.  These headphones are so good at reproducing detail that I unfortunately uncovered some issues with my motherboard's circuitry.Notes- I have a big head and wear glasses.  I have to fiddle with my glasses because the phones are fairly tight on my big dumb head.  If I take off my glasses I can wear these for long periods but if my glasses are on I have to mitigate.Note 2- a lot of the time I use these as speakers.  Set on the desk with cups rotated open towards me.  They have sufficient volume for this to be an actual usecase without getting blown out.

The reviews for my Sony's continue to stand out, but i wanted to try something else, so the former reviews of the ATH-M50x made me want to experience them.I have to say that right off the bat, the fact that they come with 3 different cables with a twist lock jack is a great idea. short, long and coily.I have replaced the cord on my Sony's a couple times since owning them along with the plug from use and abuse, this just makes sense!Next, the fact that the fold down and are fairly portable is another great aspect. solid construction, not flimsy at all.the included pouch is a nice touch.The listening experience: Very nice sound-stage, to my ears, a little wider and more spatially fuller than my Sony's. Frequency response is stellar, I put in a track that I had just finished mixing and was able to hear some tweaks that needed to be made in the upper end of the frequency range that I hadn't heard with my temporary earphones. These have great low end response without being boomy or overbearing. Just tight accurate bass. Mids are full and well balanced and the highs are crisp without being harsh.I am breaking them in while enjoying the band ""TAUK"", and the depth and mix is really well defined in these headphones.I am really enjoying them and hope to do so for a long time to come!Great bang for the buck.After you've been bamboozled by brands like ""beats"" and want to try a real set of headphones that reproduce music accurately, as it was intended to sound, grab a pair of these, you'll appreciate your music more.no hype, just great sound!Enjoy!

Leather on the cups are fantastic almost to the point of figuring out what exact material it is to use on my couch, chair, anything! These aren't noise canceling headphones but, put a very well mask on to give a great sensation that it is.Extra cables make a perfect bow to tie it all together. The cables are durable and perfect for any situation nor do they get tangled.

  This review is for the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x Professional Studio Monitor HeadphonesWe use these headphones to monitor while recording our show. The sound on these headphones has superb quality. The highs are sharp, the midrange is enjoyable, and the lows have a solid punch.It is normal to have headphones on for a couple of hours at a time while recording and editing, and for the first time i found a set of headphones that extended use leaves no fatigue even though there is significant weight. I think that the added weight is what gives the feel of a solid construction. The cans have an extremely soft cushioned and fits comfortably around your ears. The band across the top is hardly noticeable and is padded with the same as the cups. They are full sized headphones; however, they do fold up for easier transport.They are over the ear and are very comfortable. Because they don’t have the open back they keep out ambient noise while keeping sound leakage to a minimum.I especially like having a removable cable. This headset comes with 3 included. All of them have a locking mechanism to keep the cable from being pulled out. You get a short straight one, a longer straight one and a coiled one. This also comes with a screw on ¼ adaptor (that does not connect to the shorter cable). You’re no longer forced to make a choice between cables when buying your headphones.Final conclusionI have been highly impressed with all the aspects of these headphones. For the price and quality they can’t be beat.

If you want a great neutral, precise sound, these headphones are a good buy.The battery lasts forever, and they sound really good over Bluetooth (AAC is what I’ve been using), but they really shine with my stereo receiver, or hanging off a USB DAC on my laptop.They do clamp pretty hard, so I stretched them out a touch for more comfort.

  I bought these 3 years ago to replace my MDR V6. Today the arm assembly cracked while I was mixing with no force on them. I always took care of them by hanging it. It will cost me 25 dollars for a replacement arm. The durability isn't great because of these plastic parts holding the ear cups. The first year of use the ear pads started flaking but it’s much better than the MDR V6s because the pads are still intact around the stitching. The 3rd year the headband is starting to flake.

  Came to the ATH-M50x after my long-faithful AKGs finally fell apart. I never knew what I was missing. I went through and listened to nearly my entire library of music over again. There was so much in each song that I had never heard before. I remember sitting in the lobby of one of the dorms on campus and just smiling to myself because it was like experiencing all these songs for the first time. Everyone thought I was weird but what else is new.Bass is perfect. The depth of sound is better than any headphones I've ever heard (though I'm sure you can get better if you're willing to shell out a couple hundred extra bucks). It comes with multiple interchangeable cords so you can use the one that fits your needs the best. For me, this was awesome because I swapped out the default 6-foot cord for the shorter 3-footer. The days of trying to walk outside with wads of tangled cord spilling out of your pockets are over!Best of all, these things are comfortable.

The sound quality isn't noticeably better that the M30Xs, that being said I bought them because they're Blue and I wanted to be able to disconnect my cords and have different length cords. I will say, the color of these look better in person than the Pictures!

    Sound WAY Beyond Their Price
  
",5.0,J. B. Talcott,"Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2015","









  
  
    
  Short review: These headphones are better than anything else I've used in this price range (and quite a few headphones above this range).Slightly longer review: Since I got these headphones, I've been finding myself losing hours of time while I go back through everything in my music collection looking for old favorites to listen to again. The sound through these headphones is so crisp, that you will hear things you have missed in the past. The bass response is tight and satisfying, but the highs and miss have tremendous clarity. These definitely shame all the bass-heavy headphones that cost way too much and sound terrible with most genres of music.My only real gripe is the pivoting ear cups. I know that's probably a pro for lots of people, but I don't really care for it. I'd rather lose the pivoting function for increased durability over the years I'm likely to use these. I have a pair of V-Moda Crossfades, and those feel much more solid and satisfying. I'm also not crazy about the vinyl ear pads that are on almost all headphones (including these), but I have seen velvet replacements available for sale and will probably get those fairly soon. I also own a pair of incase Sonic headphones that are the single most comfortable pair of headphones ever made, as far as I am concerned. I picked them up for almost nothing right when they were discontinued, and I could wear them all day without feeling it. I wish all headphones used the same velour/memory foam pads that those used, but it doesn't seem to be popular. And unfortunately, the Sonics just can't compare to the sound quality of these headphones.Final word: I used to work in a store that specialized in high end video and audio equipment. and I've used headphones over pretty much all the price ranges and styles. These fit exactly into the sweet spot of best possible sound quality before you have to start paying a price that is above what your average music listener wants to pay.

  So, I used to have the m50x about 4 years ago but never liked the sound quality on them. Fast forward 4 years later and wanting to give the m50 series another chance and wow, these sound different then the original m50x’s from last time I tried them. The BT sounds more “fun” sounding with tighter bass. And I thought the original m50x’s were boring. Maybe audio technica changed the frequency’s on these slightly for more consumer friendly. But neither less I like the sound quality on the BT over the m50x

    Excellent comfort and sound
  
",5.0,Alex M,"Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2017","









  
  
    
  They sound great but one thing I didn't expect was how COMFORTABLE they are after coming from other headphones. The headphones I have experience with (100s of hours with each) are: Beats Mixr, Razer Kraken 7.1, and Turtle Beach XP500. I've tried Bose Quietcomfort a bit as well. These M50x's are by far the most comfortable out of all of them. The biggest problem I have with over ear headphones is that they can press my glasses into the side of my head, making them uncomfortable over long periods of time. The Beats weren't as bad, but they were so tight that they hurt my ears in a different way. The Turtle Beaches are terrible for this, and should be way more comfortable for the amount of time they're expected to be worn. I thought the Razers were finally the answer for me, and I wasn't far off; they definitely work for long periods of time. However, the M50x's blow them out of the water. They fit firmly but don't squeeze, and are very soft and fairly light. I've been wearing them for multiple hours a day since I bought them and can't stress enough how comfortable they are. They're also great for VR, which is what I bought them for originally, because they stay firmly but comfortably in place on your head while you move around, and are light enough that you forget they're even there, unlike the included earbuds which would constantly fall out and break the immersion.As far as sound I'm no audiophile, but they sound great. I feel like I hear a lot more detail in the music, and more of the nuances in the instrumentals stand out. They definitely don't have that ""thundering bass"" feel by any stretch of my imagination, but they have a very high clarity sound signature.They also come with three different cables, which I actually found very convenient for my needs. I use the 10ft cable to run from my TV to my couch, so i can watch without playing the sound through the speakers and disturbing others in the house. I have the shorter, non-coiled cable wired up to my HTC Vive. When I wanted to switch from the TV to VR, it's very nice to be able to just swap the headphones over to the other cable. Finally, the third, coiled cable can be kept somewhere if you want to plug it into a phone or other audio source when you're on the go. I like the versatility of these included cables. One other thing about the cables is that they lock into the headphone with a twisting action. At first I was a little turned off by this, as it makes it harder (maybe impossible, haven't tried) to use third party cables, but I've actually grown to like this. Using them on the couch, I would have accidentally unplugged them a dozen times if it was not for the locking cable. In VR, when cables get a little tangled up or when i need to remove the headset, letting them dangle for a second (which I wouldn't recommend doing for very long) is better than having to worry about them unplugging and falling to the floor.Overall, a really fantastic and versatile product that I would highly recommend, especially at the price.

  Excellent wireless set of headphones. Bluetooth hasn’t bugged me once and the battery life seems pretty legit. My only problem is there could be more bass but the part I like is that it allows you to hear the song EXACTLY as it is supposed to sound. This makes way for great performance in the production and mixing stages. Being able to hear your song while mixing it, will lead to perfect quality. Sometimes when it’s too bass heavy, you won’t hear how it will sound in the final product so this is spot on for audio engineering and making beats!!! Don’t cop this if you’re looking for general listening, great product for musicians and producers.

  I've had these for 4 years. They provide good noise reduction, no Active Noise Cancellation, if you are looking for that then look for that specifically. There is a good reason these are the industry standard. I've slept with/on these, sat on them, stepped on them, taken them in the rain, on camping trips, walked off with them plugged in, yanking them out of my computer or the cord out of them countless times. I broke off one of the retaining pin on one side, letting it swing away from my head, making for awkward listening, but i fixed it with a zip tie trick that I found on reddit.  I did end up messing up the cord that was included through this, so I had to get a $20 replacement, but the cans work great still. They're loud, and sound better than any I have had before. Absolutely recommend them for casual listening, or monitoring while recording. They do a ok job of keeping in sound and not bothering others on flights, if you like loud music, maybe noise cancelling is better. Recommend if you're as reckless as I.

  The sound is excellent.  When I first tried them, I could hear frequencies that were missing in my cheaper headset.  However, the ear cups are too small, my ears won't fit in them.  If they are designed to be on the ears, they are too big.  If they are designed to be over the ears, they are too small.  And my ears aren't particularly big.If you want to hear the mix, so you can tweak your mixdown, these are good for the price.  But if you want something for extended listening, you might find that your ears don't fit, and you'll get the same pain I have.

I never feel like they’re just going to slide off. I like the choice of swiveling the ear if I don’t want to have the headband on in the studio.

    These Headphones Sound Right
  
",5.0,neurodoc,"Reviewed in the United States December 28, 2018","









  
  
    
  I can usually tell fairly quickly whether the overall sound of headphones or speakers is going to be acceptable or not. These sound just right to me and I am now uninterested in listening to music with any other headphones, including higher-end models from Grado, Bose and Sennheiser. I listen to classical music and jazz. I do not appreciate thumping bass. These headphones seem extremely well balanced across the audio spectrum and the sound of instruments is more realistic than on other headphones I have used. There is more bass (by which I mean the lowest notes on a piano for example) than on other headphones, which makes the sound more complete and realistic. These headphones seem well made and are generally comfortable to have on, although the ear pads can get a bit warm. I recommend these headphones with enthusiasm.

  This is my second pair of these, and a newer model than my last pair. The last ones only needed to be replaced due to the frame breaking through clumsiness on my part, not due to a defect or design flaw.I do music production and game design, including editing of audio and sound effects. These headphones are very popular in the industry, and once you use them, you will understand why. Excellent clarity and articulation, especially at the very low and high ends of the spectrum where other headphones often color the sound.This being the newer model, I will mention that the detachable/replaceable cable is great, especially since you have a choice of lengths and can avoid having six extra feet of cable laying around - a problem with my old pair that led to their demise. Also, I feel like these have a better fit and seal out external noise better than the old ones, which may be due to better tension in the headband, or improved ear cups.I recommend this model to everyone, and should I manage to break them again, I'll happily buy them yet again.

    Excellent Pair of Headphones
  
",5.0,DaCoOpBots,"Reviewed in the United States April 2, 2016","









  
  
    
  I write this review as I'm using these excellent headphones, just to emphasize that this is a positive review.To start, Audio-Technica has a wonderful packaging presentation. Everything about it screamed quality, and nothing was there that shouldn't have been. This was a plus right off the bat.The included cables and carrying pouch are a very nice touch. Everything matches with the color that is specified in the order (I had white myself). It should be noted also that the cables are detachable from the M50x's. They lock into place, so you can only use the specified cables, which is completely fine in my case.Now the headphones themselves. Already it is clear to see that much thought was put into the design. They are flexible, yet sturdy. Nothing squeaks and everything rotates nicely. The adjustments lock into place and the headphones fold easily for transport. The only flaw in the design which I can see, (and I'm really nit-picking here), is that the leather band on top folds when worn. For all I know this may have been intentional in the design, so I can't really complain. In terms of visual appeal, I don't think I have come across a more elegant looking pair of headphones in my entire life. The white is bright, and with good maintenance, shouldn't get too dirty. I am very proud to wear these. Also one other great thing about the build is that the plastic material does not smudge. My hands sweat a lot, and I can gladly say that the material is somehow completely smudge-proof.Moving on to sound, all I can say is that these headphones provide a whole new listening experience for me. I'm no hardcore audiophile, but enjoy listening to music on a frequent basis and have listened to quite a few headphones. The M50-Xs provide crisp highs, and solid mids. I will say right now, the lows are there, but they do not protrude from the rest of the sound, which personally I think is a good thing. Sorry, if you are a bass head, these probably aren't the headphones you are looking for. Overall a very evenly distributed sound which just makes you feel good all over. Not to mention, the M50-X's have a good amount of noise cancellation. On an average volume level, almost all outside noise is blocked, and you can really loose yourself in the music. These headphones really bring a genuinely great experience, especially for that price tag.One last thing: comfort. The M50-Xs really grip your head. This helps to keep outside noise out, but can get a little uncomfortable after a couple of hours. The headband can also get uncomfortable very quickly after a few minutes. The key is to make sure the adjustments are set correctly, put the headband in the correct position on your head, and make sure none of your hair is clumped together. Do this, and I swear I forget I'm evening wearing them at all.Final verdict: The Audio-Technica ATH-M50-X Studio Monitor Headphones are an excellent looking and sounding pair of headphones, whether you're on a budget or not.Recommended for: General music listening, video games, audio editing, professional studio mixingNot recommended for: Bass headsOverall Ratings:Quality: 10/10Sound: 9.5/10Comfort: 8/10

  Pros:Comfort: My ears sweat easily and yet I can wear these for hours and remain cool or room temperature while doing so. The pads are soft and accommodate my large ears well.Sound: I guess I should have started with this first. They are amazing! All my other earphones or headphones have geared their sound towards the highs or bass but this set of cans definitely goes completely neutral while allowing me to hear every voice and instrument in all my types of music!! (Alternative Rock, Hip Hop, R&B). I've been reliving some of my favorite albums for the first time as if I'm in the studio with the artist. I've found the best way to enjoy the music is to plug these in to a DAC (external or portable) or have a phone that can actually drive these properly (LG V10, V20, V30, LG G7, ZTE Axon 7, Razer Phone).Build: The build quality is great mix of metal, leather and plastic. Feels completely solid in the hands and on the head and the articulation to fold flat on your neck or fold up into the carrying back is the best bonus of allCons:I'm not just hyping up these cans but I really haven't found too many.

    Worth the money. Can be used with a dead battery
  
",5.0,Daniel,"Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2019","Absolutely fantastic headphones!

TLDR: I would buy these again without hesitation. I might even have purchased over the ATH-M50x if these were available when I purchased my first pair a few years ago. They sound the same when running directly via 3.5mm cable. They are built the same and they feel the same; very comfortable.

Pros:
+ Can be used cord free via bluetooth connection.
+ Can be used with 3.5mm aux cable without bluetooth (like, oops, I drained my battery or no BT reception).
+ Using via 3.5mm cable doesn't require batteries, it's passive, just like any normal headphones (like the ATH-M50x).
+ The head phones have a large memory so that it will remember multiple device connections (8 if I remember).
+ The reception is good 20-30 feet away from a bluetooth device. I've been able to walk into other rooms or down stairs and remain connected. I'll get a skip or studder depending on distance and number of walls (which is totally normal and to be expected).
+ Switching between bluetooth and wired is as easy as connecting the cable. You should turn off the power switch since technically you're not streaming over bluetooth. I accidentally left the BT connection to my phone on and plugged in the cable to my laptop. It worked and I didn't realize until I walked away and returned to see the pulsing white light (I had left on the power switch).
+ I can get a few days of 8-hour use before having to charge them again.
+ They sound the same as the ATH-M50x when the power is off and they are connected via 3.5mm cable.
+ They have a small bump in base over the ATH-M50x when connected via bluetooth.
+ Same build quality and feel as standard ATH-M50x head phones.
+ Little to no sound leak (using glasses with thick frames will be an exception).
+ Although they are not noise cancelling, they do a good job isolating external noise because they are over the ear. With music playing, you won't hear much around you. With music paused, you can hear when people are trying to talk to you (planes, public transit, etc...).

Cons (the first two are minor):
- The pleather bag that comes with these is really small. Yeah, the headphones fit but it should probably have a minimum of an inch more in length and width. This would help bag not be as tight around the headphones, especially when the cable is there.
- After only 8 months, the factory 3.5mm microphone/remote cable that came in the box wore out last week. This was without any drops, yanks, or hard wear and tear. I listen to bluetooth at home and while commuting on the train. I turn off bluetooth in the office and just listen via cable because crApple osx 10.6 has massive bluetooth failures (100% apple, not the headphones).
- Micro USB to charge. Seriously, this is stupid. Micro USB is cheap so that's why people use it in hardware designs, but omg don't try to connect this to power in the dark. It will take you a year to first locate where the port is for power, let alone figuring out if the cable is upside down or not. They should have put up the money for USB-C. it's more robust and is bi-directional. That is my biggest gripe about these, honest. Everything else is tolerable.

**Edit** November 2019
It's been a year of daily use for these now. I stand by my origional review. I only wish charging was USB-C type of connector.

- Audio still great.
- Call clarity still great.
- Construction still sturdy.
- Battery still holding up.
- 3.5mm audio port still holding up.
- Single replacement cable still holding up and that's with connecting /disconnecting daily.
- Cushions still in great condition.
- BT pairing still spot on.

Regarding the comment on the factory audio cable:

I replaced the broken mic/audio cable with a nice braided cable, 3.5mm on both ends (one side naturally has an extra conductor and insulation band for the mic). For those of you looking to replace a cable, spend the money and don't buy cheap low quality cables; you'll be so much happier with a soft braided cable of higher quality of you need a replacement.",Color: BlackStyle: Wireless

  The audio quality of this headset was a very nice surprise when I tried it for the first time;  it replaced my old Sennheiser HD-280 set, which still worked but the ear pads had fallen apart.  However, the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x sound *much* better than the Sennheiser HD-280 (@ $99.99 retail), and even better than my HD-558 (originally $119.99, NOW the newer model is $199.99).  The fit of the Audio-Technical is very comfortable, the ear cushions are a solid build, and I like the fact that the audio cable can be unplugged and swapped out with one of three different styles provided by the manufacturer.  In conclusion, this is a Five-out-of-Five 5/5 headset for the price.  You'd have to pay upwards of $200 to see / feel any improvement compared to other high-end professional headsets available on the market.

  So I will start by saying that I probably had an incomplete experience of this product. I do not own any high-end stereo equipment, and I listen to most of my music on my phone or my laptop.I ended up returning these headphones. If I was listening to different types of music or listening on different equipment, who knows, I may have kept them. But as a person who mostly listens to streaming music that is heavy on guitars and higher vocals, these were really not for me. I found that the lows were super pleasant and accurate, the mids were passable, and the highs were harsh. Using these headphones, I found it very difficult to enjoy rock music, which is my go-to genre. I will say that I tried some other types of music for testing purposes (electronic, jazz, pop) and they sounded much better with all of those than they did with rock.Anyway, if you are an EDM, hip-hop, jazz or pop fan then go for it. But don't expect these to make your guitar riffs any better than tolerable.

  I've owned an old pair of ATH M50s and ordered the BT version of them as I was really happy with my old pair.The headphones sound the same as my old M50's and when using these with a headphone jack plus a DAC & AMP these are great headphones with a natural sound that can be EQ'd to your preference. Like myself, I like heavy bass and I'm able to EQ it in fairly well. But again, this is only when wired to a DAC & AMP.My first major ding is unable to use them while charging. As soon as I plug it in to charge it will disconnect the Bluetooth connection.The second ding, I can't see what the battery life is on the device. I'm using the headphones on a Windows 10 PC and it won't report the battery life and the device has no way to see battery life.My last ding is the construction, it's mostly all plastic, the key points like where the headband connections to the earphone is a plastic hinge, I've had a lot of headphones fail when they use plastic on this hinge.I couldn't recommend this product as the Bluetooth features are very lacking compared to most other BT headphones in the price range of these.

  These do everything you need them to. they are known for noise cancellation so i give them a pass on that. As soon as i used them for music, I noticed things and sounds coming through on song tracks I hadn't picked up before. I'm not an audiophile nerd but I could definitely tell the difference. would buy again. I do wish they came with a 1/4 inch headphone jack though

  Let me say from the beginning these headphones have a phenomenal sound. The lows, mids, and highs are evenly balanced. They are so comfortable that I can wear them for hours. They’re well made and if handled with care I’m sure they’ll last a long time. One word of caution when you plug in the cables you have to turn them on the headset and push them up into the connection hole. I returned my first order because I thought they were defective. Buy these headphones you won’t be disappointed.

  I've been a fan of Audio-Technica for 10+ years now, buying audio boards, mics and headphones from them when I can for my home studio.This week it was time for new headphones, the ones I had for the past 5 years were getting a little worn out and uncomfortable.Looked into my favorite company and picked these up.First, have to say, they work perfect for monitoring audio through my board when I am doing a broadcast or when editing youtube videos. This headset picks up every sniff, breath of air you take and you can even hear minor sounds in the background. Things I wasn't hearing before.It also cancels out the background big time, so all I head is what's in my headphones.To all those crying about the sound, these are monitoring headphones not headphones you attach to your phone and listen to the latest jam as you walk down the street thinking you're cool.These are perfectly balanced, no added b.s. headphones for PROFESSIONAL studio monitoring.Keep that in mind before you start crying your one star reviews.

  If you were to make a list of truly good headphones... scratch off the over-hyped fashion statement schock and high priced toys designed to make portable music players ""sound good"" - you will end up with a small list of truly good headphones sold at fair prices. These headphones WILL be on that short list, and will be around when the over-hyped ""star studded"" brands are in the landfill.Just remember that ""garbage in / garbage out"". Don't expect these quality headphones to make your smartphone and MP3 files sound like audio nirvana. With the mild exception of a slight ""v"" shape pleasing tonal balance - these are accurate and true to the master recording if you feed them a good signal.

    Good sound quality and comfortable, but fails after a year
  
",3.0,Andrew P Kostka,"Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2019","









  
  
    
  So, for the most part these are amazing headphones for the price. Sound quality, including bass volume, is amazing. I find incredible fidelity whenever I use them. However, there is a significant flaw that will most likely render these useless after about a year of daily use that you should be aware of. There is small piece of plastic that holds in the hinge that holds the ear cups to an angle that fits your head snug. After about a year of constant use, this fails and breaks. Both times I have purchased these, after a year of constant use this piece has broken, making the right side pull away from my ear (strangely the right side both times). I haven't had this issue with cheaper headphones ever, making me believe this is  planned obsolesence for this product. As much as I love these headphones, it's difficult to recommend them since you'll most likely need another pair after a relatively short period of use.

  these are the bomb. So comfortable, and also very stylish. The sound is crazy good. I am not a DJ or a producer or anything like that. I dabble in Garageband, and like to watch movies late at night. I am usually watching movies at night while my girlfriend is sleeping in the next room, so I pop these on and we are good to go! Sometime I forget I am wearing them because they are so comfortable.Pros:-Great sound-Different length cables, allows me to watch tv from the couch and not have to stay up close to the computer.-Has both studio and regular size jacks-SUPER comfortable. I have a fairly wide head and these seemed tight a first but you can stretch them out a little with some gentle tugs. fit like a glove now.Cons:-the white finish seems like it will get dirty over the years-fairly bulky

  I bought these 5 years ago because a friend of mine sat down and showed me ""what real headphones"" are. If all you are accustomed to are fashion brand headphones (skullcandy, dre etc), or ""gaming"" headphones, youre in for a treat.These headphones are stupid comfortable, and have lasted 5 years of heavy daily use and have not broke down, cracked, not one thing is ""wrong"" with them. Before i was going through ""gaming headsets"" easily every 8 to 12 months, just cheap garbage that cost at least 99 dollars.If you pair these headphones with a dedicated sound card, and enable all the bells and whistles in the cards software, these are absolutely FANTASTIC for gaming, its my primary use case. Using a dedicated soundcard with a built in amplifier will only enhance what you will get out of these.Music is amazing with these... i can go on and on.Bottom line: If you are tired of spending money on over priced gaming/fashion headphones that break or just dont sound that great and you want to INVEST in a quality headset that is not going to break the bank and blow you away with the sound you will get, these are it. And they are durable and wont break to boot.Also the detachable  cables for short/long/coiled are awesome, i take these everywhere with me.

    ATH-M50xBT wireless version finally!
  
",5.0,Six,"Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2018","









  
  
    
  I'm a big fan of wired, but have tried several Bluetooth buds and over ears in hopes to find a decent Bluetooth solution. Like others I've been disappointed by poor quality audio, poor comfort, short battery life, not loud enough, etc.Being an Audio-Technica fan, I had to grab these when they came out. So far so good.. the M50x design in general is very nice, with sturdy hinges that rotate like crazy, metal-click headband adjustments, decent size earcups, balanced, detailed sound, and nice volume level. Sound signature is indeed the same as the M50x, they crank about as loud as a wired M50x connected to a non-amped device. With that said, my dream BT headset would crank as loud as a wired set connected to a small headphone amp. These could use more juice to enhance volume and bass, but they do better than anything I've tried so I'm happy.Volume buttons work independently from my Android 8 device when connected, so be sure to adjust both device volume and headset volume.  Instructions are graphical, red light on during charging, off when full. Powered on, white light blinks when unpaired, solid white when paired.  Sturdy USB A to B charging cable, wish it was USB-C but I understand AT was trying to keep the headset cost under $200.  I imagine AptX-HD support would have made them  more expensive;  if so I think AT did good by offering only AptX as it's nearly impossible to tell the difference with standard quality streaming music (how most including me will use them).Last note is on connectivity and range. My phone is Bluetooth 5.0, and this is the first set I've tried with 5.0. I don't know if that helps with range, but I'm able to leave my phone in any room of my two-story house and go just about anywhere without connection issues. Nice! Best connectivity I've seen with a Bluetooth audio device.Update - I found a very worthy eq and volume app called Equilizer FX Pro that works flawlessly with this headset and my LG V30. The pics show my best settings. Nice EQ that actually works..

    Fantastic audio ruined by strange ticking noise
  
",2.0,Samantha Baer,"Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2020","









  
  
    
  I ordered the ATH-M50xBT after trying my friend's pair and loving them. When I received mine, I noticed two things:1. The Bluetooth would stutter occasionally, but this is to be expected, especially since I live in the city2. The right headphone had a distinct rapid clicking/ticking noise that was audible between songs or in soft/quiet songs. It's drowned out by loud music but very audible when the volume is low for any music. And it's impossible to ignore, because it's only in one ear, and it occasionally changes pitch.Because of this ticking issue, I exchanged the headphones for a new pair. But this new pair had the same issue *and* a loose rattling component in the right ear. I emailed support at this point and they told me that all Bluetooth headphones make some noise due to the electronics. However, I compared these headphones to my friend's older pair of ATH-M50xBTs and hers had no audible ticking noise, so something clearly was different and defective. I've just returned the second pair.

    My favorite headphones for the price
  
",5.0,Connor,"Reviewed in the United States July 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  I’ve been using these headphones for years. I’ve enjoyed their excellent sound quality both on the go and gaming. It’s an excellent option at the price point and I would buy them again.The headphones have a nice balance to them however bass-lovers may find these lacking. Vocals pop much more with these headphones. The sounds are clear and crisp. I also use them for gaming and find they work just as well compared to “gaming headsets.”These are over-ear headphones, with a leathery ear pads and headband. The headphones can adjust and swivel to fit most heads comfortably and I found wearing them for long gaming sessions comfortable. With extended use and sweaty/oily heads the pads will come off and absorb oil. Be sure to clean them every so often and avoid putting them near paper as the oil may come out in paper. The ear pads are removable so replacing them will extend their life.The headphones are collapsible and can fit compactly for travel. The wire can be disconnected, and comes with multiple types of Wires for ease of use. I kept the short one in my backpack and the long one plugged in my computer and switched cables for at home and on the go.These headphones are very durable as they withstood many drops without failure. My headphones did break after years of use at the hinge. when I try and wear it it bows outward.I will be buying another set soon.

  These are the best sounding closed back headphones we own.  I'm subtracting one star for the awkward sounds of the plastic flexing while wearing them in bed.  Any slight movement causes unwanted sounds when the plastic and/or metal bends and warps or presses against the pillow.  To be far, most other monitors also do this.  The only headphones we've tested that don't have this issue are the Status Audio OB-1 Open Back Studio Monitors, which sound awesome, but the ear padding is too small around my ears and the pressure is too tight on my head, and dual cables get in the way while in bed.  The Audio-Technica ATH-M50x headphones, on the other hand, are very comfortable and sound great except for the sounds when moving against a pillow/headrest.  .

  Pros :Comfortable fit, even for big ears.Flat sound, good for studio work / audiophilesGreat design, build quality.Useful carrying pouch and 3 detachable cablesCons :-Can take some time to get used to the flat sound. After using bass heavy headphones, these might sound weak.-Small soundstage. Lack of ""space"" in the sound meaning sounds feel very close and don't give a sense of ""distance"". These aren't the best headphones for gaming as you want directional sound. (Search for open back cans)-Not for everyone. The sound is amazing throughout the entire spectrum but it is very flat. This is great for mixing and studio work but some people might want headphones that have more bass or less focus on the mids / highs.Verdict :I like these a lot. Music has never sounded clearer and more balanced. There is no clipping or distortion and every sound on the spectrum can be heard irregardless of what sounds are already playing. Instruments sound incredible, voices are defined and the bass is crisp and clear while not overpowering.After using bass heavy earbuds for a while, these took a few hours to get used to. But now I can appreciate how music is supposed to sound like.10/10 would recommend to whoever wants the best bang for your buck pair of headphones.10/10 studio work10/10 music listening  9/10 bass music. You can bass boost though.  9/10 gaming. Small soundstage.  9/10 travel. Wired, no noice cancelling. Good noise isolation however.10/10 style/looks. White looks incredible.

  I bought these for editing videos and to listen to music while working on said videos, and honestly, I'm not impressed. These have little to no bass (which I don't want too much when editing, but the bass was practically non existent) and the treble was waaaay to crisp. As someone who grew up in a family of musicians and has a lot of family in the music industry, but not personally perused that avenue, I know what good sound should sound like and these just aren't doing it for me. And definitely not for that price tag. I have Sony headphones that are cheaper than these with better sound quality... and no, more bass does not mean better sound quality. Basically, if you're looking for a set of headphones where all you hear is the treble and the singer, these are perfect, but if you want to listen to music, videos, games, or even podcasts and listen for all the instruments, tones, and sound effects that are occurring on a track or background, skip these and find something else.I tested these with various songs from various genres, podcasts, and youtube videos and wasn't satisfied, so I'm returning them. Packaging was good, and the points of articulation on the headset are nice. They are comfortable, light weight, and pretty sturdy for the most part and could definitely be worn for longer periods of time.One thing I did notice, was that you could hear the video or song coming from the headset as someone wore them and you could almost use them as speakers for around your neck, so they have a lot of sound leakage. The Noise Cancelation was okay, and I could still hear the person next to me talk, they just sounded a little muffled, with the music on low or off, whereas other headphones I have with the same feature I can hardly hear other people at all.I was unable to test battery life, because I didn't keep them long enough to find out.Hope all this helps other youtubers and music nerds out there!

  These headphones sounded great, were comfortable and I loved them, but apparently the my phone, the OnePlus 3T, is the only device it wouldn't pair with.  Saw a similar posting on the OnePlus forums and when I called the manufacturer they said they had received several calls complaining about non connection from other people with my same phone.  Their only recommendation was to return the headphones.I cleared my Bluetooth cache, tuned off/on paired over and over, but after 1 to 15 minutes my Bluetooth connection on my phone would turn off and one by itself uncontrollably.  I've paired other Bluetooth devices for an indefinite time with my phone and had no problem until I paired the m50xbts.The headphones did successfully pair with another smartphone (Nexus 5) and my Dell laptop, but not worth the OnePlus 3T.

    Good sound and build, some minor problems and annoyances, but NOT TO BE USED WITH COMPUTERS.
  
",3.0,Tan Tjin-Han,"Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2019","Update Nov 13th, 2019.
The battery level indicator issue still persists everywhere, on Android phones, Connect APP, and Windows 10. All three shows different levels altogether, and the engineering team responded with multiple answers:
- They provide a replacement, but will not troubleshoot the existing issues.

- They refused to troubleshoot the Windows 10 since they claimed the headset is designed only for smartphones, never mind there are illustrations on their own guides where the headset is supposed to be connected to a computer for the charging process. Therefore, proceed at your own risk if you plan to use this headset with your computers.

- That answer brings forward the issue with smartphones. As they stated it's a smartphone exclusive headset, they still failed to troubleshoot the battery indicator issue with Android where it is just plain inaccurate borderline useless. Their conclusion is APPs' fault, which in this case is their own Connect APP and Android itself - all Nougat, Oreo, and Pie. The fact they won't make the headset to work properly with their own Connect APP, which is clearly advertised, is enough reason for me to knock a star off the review.

The whole experience with the support team gave me the impression of half-hearted efforts from AT, and at times it seems they would avoid responsibility given chance.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
I have such a mixed feeling on this one.

INTRODUCTION
The build and quality are great right out of the box, nice packaging, and decent accessories. Noise cancellation got 1 star because the headset doesn't have a noise cancellation at all, so no surprise there. I'm not quite sure I want to isolate myself from the surroundings when I wear the headset the absence of noise cancellation is perfectly fine for me, so 1 star isn't necessarily bad in this case. Also, when you're playing audio at a moderately loud level you couldn't hear your surroundings.

PROBLEMS
On to the unpleasant part of the review.

In Bluetooth mode, several problems cropped up in the early several hours of my hands-on. Most of the audio-related problems don't exist in cord mode.

The headset emitted some kind of interference inaudible pitch in Windows 10 during idle, which caused uncomfortable pressure to the eardrums. It didn't happen when paired with an Android phone.

There are no sounds at all when the headset is used to play Grand Theft Auto V and Mechwarrior Online. The alternative is to revert back to corded mode.

The battery level indicator is simply broken on Android. It will always show 100% no matter what the actual level it. The Connect APP has a battery gauge but it also feels inaccurate, and there are very few other functions offered other than headset locator and firmware updater. Windows 10 battery gauge works the best, but it also doesn't seem to be updated in real-time. I need to disconnect and reconnect before the number would change. It's a minor annoyance, but an annoyance still.

SOUND QUALITY
To my untrained ears, it sounds just as pleasant as Jabra 85h and more reasonable than the overly loud bass of Beats, which both are considerably more expensive. Bluetooth mode and corded mode sounds almost indistinguishable, apart from the volume boost in Bluetooth mode.

CONCLUSION
If they can fix that battery indicator problem, it's going to be an easy 5 star.",Color: BlackStyle: Wireless

  Haven't even had these for year and they are already failing on me. There is constant static and it takes constant twisting of the cord to get the music to come in at least barely clearly. I never dropped, damaged or abused them in any way. Clearly, it's a poorly made piece of plastic and the sound wasn't even that great when they did work, but I just attributed it to the cheap price. It was all treble and now it's all static. I hate to say it but my Beats lasted longer and sounded better. Hopefully the V-Modas I bought will hold up better.

  I was very excited to receive these headphones because I've heard nothing but good things about the M50s and, as someone who gets up to move around a lot, just the simple fact that they were wireless made it a no brainer for me to purchase. First impressions were pretty great. The sound is loud and clear and while the fit feels kinda tight, you get used to it and it conforms to whatever shape head you have pretty smoothly.That being said, make sure you get the Audio Technica app on your phone and UPDATE THE FIRMWARE. I kept running into this issue where if I were to pause something making sound on my PC (Spotify or YouTube, for example) it would pause every single sound on my PC and the only way to get around this was to mute the application but keep it ""playing"" in the background. This was unacceptable! I tried reinstalling the drivers, repairing them, etc. Nothing was working. I was just about to return these headphones when I saw that there was an update available for these headphones. All I did was get the app and the headphones updated OTA and now everything is great! Just keep in mind that the update took me about an hour. Very slow download but was well worth it in the end just to be able to use these headphones hassle free - and it truly is hassle free!They connect automatically, they're easy to disconnect, the range is pretty good, and best of all the battery lasts forever.Highly recommend these headphones to anyone looking for a great pair of wireless headphones for work or gaming.

  This is the third pair of Audio Technica I have tried, each one sucks in their own way. No idea why they are so overrated. They lack bass, crush highs, and are completely boring with nearly every genera of music. Forget EDM, Techno, Punk, and Rock. They were OK with classical, piano, and vocals. Very little detail in sound for the price, Apple earbuds do a better job. For studio they MIGHT be ok, but casual listening at work or home is underwhelming at best. I went with the V-MODA Crossfade, but wired only, as the bluetooth is laggy. Way better sound.

  I've been on the market for the ""perfect"" headphones for a long time.  In the last 4-5 years I've had Astros, HyperX, Sennheiser, HP Omen Mindframe, and a few others trying to find what I was happy with.  Most the headphones I've had were great and I enjoyed using but would still find myself shopping for something else.I have been eyeing the ATH-MX50 for a while and decided to finally pull the trigger on purchasing.  Following the instructions of other reviews, I also purchased aftermarket Ear Pads to replace stock ones immediately.  This is an absolute MUST in my opinion.  They're alright with the standard Ear Pads but they are down right perfect for my big head with the aftermarket Ear Pads.I'm no audio expert but games just hit different the moment I started using these.  Bass was super crisp.  Audio was clean.  I was hearing things I've never heard in game before.  And things I did know about was coming through so much more clear.  I've already recommended these headphones to all my gaming buds.  Do yourself a favor and order these bad boys!

  I really like these headphones. I have mostly purchased sony line of extra bass headphones in the last decade or so. I've had the sony XB500s and the sony XB950b1s. Ive also had the in ear extra bass headphones from sony as well. I have also had in ear solid bass headphones from audio technica. Before those I had the original skull candy crushers which had bass powered by a AAA battery. That was about 10 years ago. As I have gotten older I have decided to move away from the bass heavy headphones. This is my first pair of professional monitor headphones. I know that people say these have stronger bass then a lot of monitoring headphones. While I have nothing to compare them too I would say they are not even close to as bass heavy as what I am used too. In a few pop songs I have heard parts of the songs that were before drowned out by bass. O think the sound quality is great and it definitely plays a more true to the music type of sound. Build quality is worlds better than what I am used too. The sony xtra bass headphones each lasted me about two years before they fell apart. Keep in mind I am very gentle with my headphones and only use them at home. I believe these headphone will outlive the previous ones I have owned by a lot. Comfort wise they are not as comfortable as the extra bass sonys but more comfortable then the skull crushers. The sony headphones I used were made very lightweight and had huge ear cushions. These are still very comfortable. I have a smaller head and ear size (i wear them on the smallest size selection) the reason I say this is because if you have a larger head or larger ears I can see these as being uncomfortable.TLDRI really like the true to the music sound with just slight punchy bass. These really suits my needs as I primarily listen to Pop music from around the world including America.

  The sound is, first and foremost, the main reason I got these. Sound is great. Build quality overall is also great, my favorite actually. However, what can be a big flaw is the quality of the earpads. Good at first, but can really be painful about an hour in. Don’t fall asleep with these on. I recommend changing out the earpads with Wicked Cushions. They’re a little too soft and can cause your ears to sweat but are great for long use. Perfect combo with these headphones. Still, my go to pair overall.

  I broke my Bose earphones and was in search of replacements.  Reading reviews, I assumed that these are comparatively cheap with similar kind of specs. I half heartedly purchased these just to test them out. After trying them out first, there was no looking back and I feel these are far better.  I was explaining this to my son, who borrowed these.  After trying he never gave them back (he smiles, whenever I ask them to return) - am glad that it turned out to be a good buy.

  I purchased this a year ago and have used it quite a bit.  One thing to note for people who are looking to purchase this headphone, this is a professional studio monitor headphone. Your audio experience will not be simnilar to the Sony WH-1000XM3 nor the Bose QC 35II or similar headphones. The audio is very flat, a bit of bass but for the most part the sound is quite flat. It's main intended use is for audio recording/mastering so it's important that the audio has to be flat before applying any tweaks. If you're looking for a headphone with enhanced bass, or enhanced mids, skip this headphone. Of course you can use an EQ app/program to achieve the audio experience you want.The build quality of this headphone is superb. I've used it whilst asleep loads of times and it never physically brakes. I've had other headphones (House Of Marley headphone ) before that if I fall asleep with it on, the plastic/material would break after few uses.

  I'm an audio engineer, and for the price point and overall practically these headphone are excellent. The only problem you'll run into is you won't want to wear them for 45+ minutes in most cases. They are a bit thick, but it comes with the territory of the type of headphones. Possibly in the future there will the a lighter-weight material that will still block a considerable amount of outside noise.

  These headphones are absolutely fantastic for someone who truly wants to hear ALL of the music and isn't afraid to divert from ""hyped-up"" headphone brands like BOSE or Beats.Crisp highs, great mids, and the bass is on the full and punchy.  All around a fantastic listening experience for anyone no matter what sort of music you like.  I feel like these really shine for club music -- hip-hop, dubstep, electronic, etc.  However even country music sounds like you are there in the studio with the artist and producer.  For $120-$150 these are absolutely worth it.Make sure to adjust the headband to your head size in order to get the most comfortable fit.  Also, the swiveling ear cups allow the the cushions to sit comfortably at any angle of your head to relieve pressure points.Side note:  The first pair of these I ordered had somewhat of a bass imbalance.  After doing some research on the internet, I learned this can be a common manufacturer's defect with the M50X and M40X's.  Sometimes the bass in the left ear cup is slightly stronger than the right ear cup.  This may or may not be noticeable to most people, but for me it definitely was.  I was skeptical, but after having an Amazon send me a replacement pair, I can say these new M50X's are perfectly balanced!  If you receive a pair you think is imbalanced, send them back and get a new pair!

  I've been using these for a about a month now. They are not going to change your life, nor the way you listen to music. Not to say that they are bad, but I expected more since I had never spent more than $40 on a set of headphones before. There is certainly a difference however, in the quality of the sound (I wont pretend to know the terms). Seems clearer, and the high notes don't seem to distort as much, plus good bass. The BT is seamless, pairing directly up to my phone and computer. Though the sound quality takes a hit in BT mode, it's still a  few steps above any other BT headphones I've used. I would recommend these to someone who wanted to enjoy a pretty good quality sound (wired or wireless), but didn't expect audiophilic perfection.If these still works in a year, I'll give it the 5th star.

    If you enjoy a lot of bass when you listen to music ...

  Review of Audio Technica's ATH-M50xWhen you buy headphones, there is a lot of criteria that you can look at. Sound quality is arguably the most important part when looking at headphones. Next you want to look at is; the type of headphones and what the physical quality is. The last thing to consider when buying headphones is the price that you would have to pay.SOUNDSo first up is looking at the sound quality of Audio-Technica's ATH-M50x headphones. The two main things I use my headphones for are gaming and listening to music. Right away I noticed how clear the music was with the headphones; because of that, you could pick up on every single sound in the song. When I began listening to music I realized that some of those songs sounded scratchy and had background static. I realized that the recording of the song was the reason for this and the headphone was just able to pick up on it. If you enjoy a lot of bass when you listen to music I'm not sure these are the headphones for you. The bass is well rounded but when you listen to the heavy bass songs you can't really notice it.QUALITY & TYPENext, I'm looking at the build quality and the type of headphones that the ATH-M50x is. These are studio headphones that are over ear and have a closed-back. Since they are closed-back, they have better sound isolation don’t leak sound nearly as much as an open back would. Looking at the build quality, I am fairly impressed with the structural quality of the headphones, as well as how compactable they are. The padding on both the ears and the headband are comfortable for long sittings as well.PRICELastly, you want to look at the price for these headphones. These headphones are usually sold for around $150 on amazon. That may seem expensive but for what you are getting it is a steal. Audio-Technica's ATH-M50x are arguably the best headphone in this price range, even beating other headphones in the $200-$300 price range.  If you are wanting to splurge on a new set of headphones, you won't go wrong with these.SUMMARYThese headphones have great, clear sound quality that helps you notice every single sound presented. They are comfortable for short or long periods of use and are built great. If you are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars on a pair of headphones, you couldn’t possibly go wrong with buying these.

  Bought these to pair with my Samsung TV while my wife passes out on the couch. Pairing was super easy, and aside from some weird lag the first time I turned them on, they've been great ever since. Sound quality is excellent, with a pretty good response across the tonal spectrum. They seem to last a pretty long time. I charge them every few days, but I haven't run in to a low battery yet.My only disappointment with them is the comfort. They squeeze a little tight (I wear a M/L size hat). The pads are a little stiff, especially compared to my old second generation Bose QCs, and the diameter of the cups is just a tad smaller than I'd like. I do have pretty big ears, but I do find my ears cramping up a bit after an hour or two.

  Great sound quality. I am hearing sounds I've never heard of before in the music and movies. Sound quality is excellent. My only criticism: 1- I had a hard time aligning the cups; they have a unique design. I struggled with them a little bit, it took me a while to put them in the right position. I may be the only person who had that struggle LOL. However, there is nothing in the manual that explains how to align the cups. Or if there was, it wasn't sufficient. I remember reading the whole thing but not seeing any particular instructions about how to position the cups. The other criticism is that the cable that I had to use for plugging into my Yamaha receiver has some connectivity problems, if the cable moves a little bit, sometimes the audio briefly cuts out. I called the customer service and left a message (they were closed due to Covid-19) but haven't heard back. It's not a big deal. You may want to test your cables and if you notice any issues, you may ask for a replacement. Those cables are not very expensive; you can probably buy them separately as well. To me, the sound quality is the priority. And this product delivers it.

  This is my first bluetooth over ear headphones and it is great for its price. Noise cancellation works very well. When I'm on a plane it blocks out most other noises. I've worn it upwards of 3-4 hours at a time and it is very comfortable, I didn't experience much pain that I usually do when wearing headphones for a long time. Have yet to have the battery die on my while listening but if it does, it comes with a connector to make it work wired. The bluetooth connection also works very well, much better than the multiple wireless earphones that I've used for running.

  Best headphones I've tried for the price. Very comfortable with top sound quality. The frame is also sturdy enough to handle most falls from desk height onto solid flooring without cracking. The audio cable has been yanked out several times after getting caught onto something and no audio port degradation has been experienced. The one major negative is that the false leather coating the foam headband and earpads started cracking severely after a year and a half despite being well maintained. Thankfully, the flaking hasn't been as bad as with the usual budget headphones, but new earpads and a wool cover for the headband will have to be bought.

  They still work great after four years of use. To me they sound better than the recent sony 1000XM3, though the sony noise canceling is great for when I want that. I'm no audiophile but the sonys have more base while the M50Xs are clearer overall. After years of use, the included earpads will wear out with their outer layer flaking off, though they are simple to replace. The headband faux leather is also cracked and flaking off, though it hasn't impacted use or comfort yet.Just took a moment to look it up, and there are various headphone headband covers being sold for around $10 for this exact purpose. Thanks capitalism.

  These headphones are NOT for a casual audiophile.  They are perfect for a project studio or an acoustic engineer on a budget.  These are monitor headphones for music production/studio use.  If you just want to groove out to music and enjoy it, go with the Sony noise-cancelling kind that sells for less than 1/2 the price of these.The frequency response is very flat -- so flat that it can be fatiguing to the ear over long periods of time.  They reproduce every detail of the music, but not necessarily in a pleasing way; every imperfection in the mix can be heard.  Basically, if a mix sounds good on these, then they are likely going to sound good on everything else too.The bass on these can be muddy at high volume.  They're comfortable enough, but not especially so; you know when you have them on.

    GREAT AUDIO BUT Poor Bluetooth Technology
  
",3.0,Reviewing For Fun,"Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2019","









  
  
    
  I have the original non-Bluetooth ones. And for a $159 headphone I expected a little more in this Bluetooth version.PROS:1 Audio is great, like the old ones, especially the bass; in my opinion, better than my Bose QC35II and Sennheiser PXC 550 which are ANC Headphones.2. Although not the most comfortable headphones, they are a little better than the original ones which have a painful clamping force.3 I have not tested this yet but they’re supposed to have a great battery life (40) hours. I suppose this estimate is by playing them at not too loud settings.CONS:1.- Bluetooth works fine with Android but is a hassle to make it work with Windows 10. I will provide a solution at the en of the page. I learned it from DeaconSlim at the Microsoft forums.2.- Quality of materials seems a little cheap. And volume/skip, play/puase buttons are flat and hard to identify with your finger.3.- At this price range I think they should have ANC (Active Noise Cancelling). That would make them much more desirable.4.- The touch for Google Assistant is not very reliable. Is a hit and miss. Works about 50% of the time for me.5.- When bluetooth connects to a device it only says: ""Bluetooth connected"", it does not tell you what device you're connected to. Unlike bluetooth headphones in other brands, It also seems to not be able to connect to more than 1 device at a time.To make it work with Windows 10:1. Go to Bluetooth & other devices in Settings.2. On the right side of the screen under ""Related settings"", click on Devices and Printers.3. Find your device listed.  (For example, my headphones are the Audio-Technica ATH-M50xBT headphones, and were listed at the bottom of the window under ""Unspecified"").4. Right click the device and select Properties.5. Select the Services tab.6. I'm not sure which of these did the trick, but there are 5 Bluetooth Services listed (Audio Sink, Drivers for keyboard, mice, etc (HID), Headset, Remote Control, and Remotely Controllable Device).  I checked all 5.7. Click Apply. (After this I heard in my headphones ""Bluetooth Connected"").8. Click OK.Headphones or Bluetooth audio device should be working and selected as the enabled audio device.

    OK off your phone, outstanding if you use a small dac/amp
  
",5.0,reviewer,"Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2019","









  
  
    
  So around 2014-2016, I became an audiophile and tried all of the nice headphones. HD800, Audeze LCD-x, 3 … $2,500 iems … I could go on and on. I eventually settled on two that I liked, the Shure SE215 and the Jerry Harvey Roxannes. I only listen to music when out, and need isolation, and comfort, and these fit the bill. I really liked their sound too.Getting bored, I thought I'd get a full-sized headphone to wear to the gym sometimes. These arrived last night and I'm returning them today. I wore them and listened to music off of my phone and, it sounds good, but nothing great and these are heavier and look more bulky than my iems. If I return something, I want it returned in pristine condition so I don't feel like I abused the policy, so I only used them for an hour before packing them up.So why did I give these five stars? Well, this morning I unpacked it again and tried them again on my phone. Again, meh. Not bad in any way but not amazing. Out of curiosity, I then plugged them into my ESS9018 hifimediy portable dac/amp (not expensive, only $120 when I got it in 2014) and WOW -- they were elevated to $1,000 headphone status. Every song sounded amazing, exciting, perfect bass, highs and mids. So these are apparently much harder to drive than people think but if you give them a proper dac/amp they will sound amazing.Conclusion: If you're going to drive them off of your phone, they're OK I guess but probably meh. If you have a basic dac/amp with sufficient power, they're amazing.

  I've used these headphones everyday for 3 years now and I still love them as much as the day I bought them. I bought these during the 2015 prime day for $141 and I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase.I wear them for usually 4-8 hours per day and I never have had any problems with the comfort. However, I did purchase a set of velour ear pads a month or so after my purchase (which I highly recommend).These are a closed back set of headphones and over the ear so there's not a whole lot of noise that bleeds out and could annoy nearby people. Sound quality is great to me, though I am no audiophile.I also received the Brooklyn Labs bluetooth adapter as a christmas present this past year. I originally hated it. I thought the sound quality was horrible, but it turned out to be an issue with my PC's bluetooth receiver and not the headphone adapter. I still think it's a bit expensive at $50, given the build quality but it's a lot cheaper than purchasing a whole different set of headphone just to use as a wireless pair.

  Amazing quality for the price. I have be clear and fair. You need Sonarworks to get the full 4.5 star rating these headphones are capable of producing throughout the frequency range. To be fair these headphones are designed for music production and mixing/engineering purposes. Although these headphones are capable of cancelling some noise while recording vocals, they are not specifically designed for noise cancelling purposes. Hence why professional studio environments have the budget to acquire multiple different headphone types to meet specific listening requirements. The material quality is very durable and long lasting without diminishing over time. I highly recommend this model for any home studio mixers and producers. Again if your serious about sound I would highly suggest saving for Sonarworks reference 4 to get that extra 15% out of your headphones and/or monitors.

  See other reviews for audio quality. I only want to comment on comfort. I was very hesitant to buy these for fear they'd make my ear tissue sting like my older wired audio technicas, or give me headaches from clamping pressure. They don't. They're snug, and the first time I wore them I thought they gripped too tightly, but I have now had them for a couple weeks and wear them for hours at a time, in bed, working out, running, or watching stuff on my laptop, and they're great. The clamp is snug but not uncomfortable, and I appreciate the grip when I run or lift. If you were literally just going to sit at a computer (and then, why buy wireless?) I'd say get something bigger and looser, but for moving around, I'd likely prefer these. I'm a bigger guy and imagine I have an above-average sized head.

  Ok!  I never leave reviews but these are too good.Long time Beats Solo 3 user, recently discovered Tidal for Hifi quality streaming (Way better than Spotify for audio quality).  Wanted a great set of headphones to fully appreciate the audio quality.  First tried a pair of Grado 225e's.  Crazy uncomfortable.  I didn't think it would bother me but it did.  The Grado highs/mids are beautiful but sometimes a bit harsh.  Low-end was virtually nonexistent.  I was also in a conundrum with the huge Grado cable and its weak clamp force.  Would these fall in the sink while I'm doing the dishes?  Not secure at all.Insert the M50XBT.BEST OF BOTH WORLDS.  Wireless when you need to be wireless.  Very subtle audio quality substitute for that portability.Wired when you have the chance to just sit and enjoy tunes.Great clamp force.  Very comfortable.  Great low-end. These phones put a smile on my face and made me want to dance.If you really want to melt into your tunes, add in a Dragonfly Black and these SING.ATH50xBT + Tidal + Dragonfly Black=  Happiness.You're welcome.

  I have, for the longest time, settled for cheaper headphones and opted to replace them more frequently.My purchase of the Audio-Technica m50x is my first investment for a high-quality set of studio headphones. They have EXCELLENT build quality. The ear padding is extremely comfortable and allows for extended gaming hours without 'fatigue' that commonly comes with headphones. The padding around the ears is firm yet soft enough for glasses to be worn without feeling like they are being pressed into your head (a common problem with other headphones).The sound quality is excellent. The only problem is once in a blue moon, a song will have too much bass. Although, this is rather subjective.Sound quality is 10/10. Very impress with durability. I would recommend these headphones to anyone looking to have a first-entry into high-quality studio headphones.

  Oh my God. I expected these to be good. I just got them, and I just started listening to them. I'm not an audiophile. I haven't even broken them in yet, but, I've read that's thing. I tell you what, though. I can sure as hell tell the difference between these and my Sol Republic V8 headphones I got a few years ago. Those, and, I imagine many of the same ilk, needlessly boost bass and people think that's a good thing. Listening to Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, I'm loving how clear everything is. I have them plugged into a FiiO E10K USB DAC and Headphone Amplifier, https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00LP3AMC2, that's only $76 right now. I literally don't think I can listen to anything else now if I want to listen to music. This is absurd. It's amazing. Do yourself a favor and add this to your cart.

  I sold AT headphones when I was selling instruments and professional audio gear. I have a pair of 40s that were 350 back in the day. Here’s something people get wrong about these headphones. These are reference monitors . Meaning they have a flat frequency response . Most headphones have a boosted bass and treble and scooped midrange. So people’s ears are used to hearing that frequency profile . These reproduce sound as it WAS RECORDED. They do not color sound . What you put in them as close to the original recording or sound source as possible . The sound is balanced , the bass is tight as it should and not flabby and eating your other frequencies up and it doesn’t have jacked treble to kill your eardrums. The Bluetooth works great! The mic does a great job with phone calls. The battery life is amazing. They are comfortable to wear. As far as being “cheap made” ALL headphones are made of plastic. So unless you’re throwing them around, they will last a good while . It’s basic , take care of your stuff and it won’t break. These are worth the price tag . Great balanced sound . Not harsh or shrill . Buy them !

  Simply amazing, been hearing the hype about these headphones for years. Finally got them and it's simply insane. I've tried Bose, Sony, and these are king in the crisp clariity you get.But if you value noise cancelling then these won't do it for you, don't get me wrong they have more then solid isolation but nothing like Sony or Bose with the active noise cancelling they provide.They do have a version of these with noise cancelling but it messes with the profile and ruins the whole sound signature from what ive read online.

  Robust sound profile, sturdy and luxurious feel, wide sound area.I have a huge head and these headphones feel pretty tight, but I think with time they will clamp less, I hope. Clamping pressure is my biggest complaint so far.They sound nice and flat on a desktop sound card but I like bass and take the liberty of using an equalizer to make them sound how I like. Even with an extreme bass setting, high hats in music still sound pretty shrill and piercing, I'm not sure why that is.I think these headphones are going to take some getting used to. They don't have any detriments that would make me return them yet but I didn't love them immediately. 4 stars.

    Disappointing
  
",3.0,new Clancy reader,"Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  Having many years ago purchased the wired version of ATHM50 which I absolutely love, I found this wireless version to be quite a disappointment but not enough of a disappointment to return them.  The sound quality is noticeably worse than the old wired pair by comparison and I can hear some distortion in some songs such as Chandelier.  The controls on the earpiece of the headphone are difficult to find and use; not very ergonomic in terms of use.  Unlike my Sony wireless phones, you cannot easily switch from connecting from one device to another.  The documentation, such as it is, for this product seems to indicate this is possible but I have only managed to change devices once by accident by first removing the earphones from bluetooth on the device and then reconnecting.  So if you plan to buy these headphones, you better be prepared to attach them to only one device and stick with it rather than to think you can easily use it to connect to multiple devices.  So I am using them solely with my iPad and they are the best bluetooth headphones I have for that device.  Fortunately, I have other bluetooth headphones of slightly less sound quality that I can use to easily connect and unconnect from all my other devices.  So overall, these have been a disappointment.  I didn't feel bad enough about them to return them but I would most certainly never purchase them again and am generally sorry I purchased them in the first place.

    I have to say that these are the best sounding headphones I've ever used
  
",5.0,Lucky,"Reviewed in the United States October 15, 2016","









  
  
    
  I have to say that these are the best sounding headphones I've ever used, and I have used a lot of headphones. Now I tested them on my laptop, as well as my phone and they are absolutely BEASTLY on my phone (S7 Edge).Build Quality:The whole headphone construction is plastic, aside from the aluminum frame that hides nicely under the leather. The frame is very, very flexible, and the headphones are easy fit. Despite having plastic constructions, these headphones feel premium. Another place where I'd give some remakrs is that the cables they ship with are just too good, they are thick with the right amount of rugged feel to them; you get 3 cables in total, one 3.0 meter straight cable, one 3.0 meter coiled cable (the one I'm using right now) and one 1.2 meter straight cable.Comfort:Now usually you'd expect the headphones to be heavy, as well uncomfortable, well the good thing is that these headphones are extremely comfortable despite being a bit on the heavier side. The fit is extremely snug, and the easily accommodate your ears within the generously spaced ear cups. The padding is really, really soft, and doesn't warm your ears at all. I spent about 7 hours wearing them constantly, and surprisingly, didn't have to take them off to adjust, or to scratch my ears. The headphones use faux leather as the padding, and it's really, really soft. Though for those who want, there's custom made leather padding available too.Sound Quality:Now comes the most important part; I was really scared despite all the positive reviews I've read, and watched. However, the phone remark that sealed the deal for me was when my friend working in studio told me that he uses these headphones to mix and master the amazing Ehl-E-Rock music. The sound on these is just... too good. More like phenomenal. These don't ship with an overpowered bass, or an overpowered treble; they have a completely flat frequency response that gives them the ability to adjust themselves to pretty much any genre of music you listen to. I tested several different sub-genres of Metal including heavy, thrash, and progressive, and I was surprised how these headphones were solid even when I used the ""Flat"" equaliser, as well as my own. There is an amazing amount of noise isolation that's completely passive, to test it out, I sat in my parent's room to work, and listened to Slayer, Opeth, Alter Bridge, and a couple of other bands on max volume, and there wasn't any sound leaking.Final Thoughts:It doesn't matter if you are a metal head, these headphones treat the music like the music was tuned for these, it doesn't matter if you are listening to MP3, or FLAC, the sound will still be as refined as it gets. I am going to an extent of saying that these are the best sounding headphones I've ever used, and thanks to their low impedance, I can use them on my phone without sacrificing on anything.

  I originally ordered the Sennheiser Momentum which sounded very good but were so uncomfortable I had to send them back. (Emusic Enterprise sent me an open box which contained used headphones, fulfilled by Prime)Anyway, these M50x's are wonderful. My Macbook Air handles them quite well, due to their relatively low impedance. Not so much on my Ipad but I listen to them on the Macbook 95% of the time. I think the sound is at least comparable to the Momentums if not better. I say that because there's slightly more separation with these and a more opened soundstage. The bass is less muddled and they're Much more comfortable. So yea I just convinced myself that they are better, to my ears, than the Momentums.I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these to anyone that's looking for a pair of headphones under $200.00. The legacy continues.

  WOW!!  These are amazing sounding headphone.  They blow Beats, Bose, and even my Bang and Olufsen out of the water.  I really can't explain to you how good they sound.  But here is my breakdown:Looks: Well, lets just say they are not lookers.  They're not bad, but people aren't ever going to say that these look good on you.  Lots of plastic, and some of it feels cheap.  However, I can tell that these will hold up under excessive use.  I would recommend a hard shell case if you travel a lot.Comfort: Again, not the best in this category either.  My B&O and Bose are more comfortable, but they are not, by any means, uncomfortable.  The cups are large enough to fit over my larger ears, and they don't press too hard on either side.  Plus, you can stretch them out by pulling on both ear-cups.  They did get a little hot after using for 30-60 minutes, but my ears tend to get hot in any headset.Sound: These are the best, most balanced headset I have ever heard.  I have much more expensive and higher quality cans, but I keep going back to these for my daily use.  The sound-stage ins't that wide, I'll say that.  But the highs are crisp and not too hissy, the bass is firm and not fake, the mids are mild and smooth.  Everything just sounds the way it should and not processed.  My B&O which cost three times as much, can't compare with these (neither can my Beats or Bose for that matter).  You almost forget they are on (until my ears get warm) as the sound isn't harsh at all.  Everything just blends nicely.  Jazz music is especially nice in these.  Get yourself some good FLAC files and enjoy these babies.  For their current price of $130, its a steal.Overall: I was hesitant to buy these, because I already have a few pairs of cans.  I listened to all the reviewers on YouTube, and when I saw they were only $130, I went for it.  I am so, very happy that I pulled the trigger.  GO FOR IT!

  This is my 1st bluetooth headset.  I have been a wired person for years and I finally decided to go the BT route since I like to just listen untethered and be able to move around and not have to disconnect.  Did alot of homework and the AT headphones came out on top.  The separation between left and right is amazing!  And I am able to hear notes and instruments I never heard with cheap ear buds, headphones and I hate to say it...even my Bose headsets!.  The original cups on the headset are a wee bit small and I feel a little trapped in them.  I did buy some aftermarket cups but have not yet put them on.  Battery life is awesome and lives up to the specs. Button placement is a pain especially if I want to fast forward to the next song. But its something I can get past. Definitely well worth it considering the price point.  Although not active noise canceling, the cups do a great job masking out the external noise.

  I had considered purchasing these headphones in the past, but ended up getting the V-Moda Crossfade M-100's instead, also from Amazon. After losing my V-Moda's, I purchased these. Then I found my V-Moda's, but decided to keep using the ATH-M50x as my main set of headphones.The headphones sound fantastic! While the V-Moda's have slightly more bass, it's not by that much. One thing that I will say is that the ATH-M50x do require a bit of burn-in time. Out of the box they sound good, but not overly impressive. After a couple days of solid use at work, the difference is easily noticeable. The sound is balanced, and the bass is punchy and has some depth. The mids and highs are more noticeable than on the V-Moda's.The build quality feels quite solid, although they may not be quite as sturdy or as stylish as the V-Moda's, which feel indestructible. (see build quality update below)They are noise-cancelling - I don't hear anyone around me unless I have the volume set very low.Finally, I bought the Amazon Warehouse Deals set for $119 and to my surprise, there wasn't any damage to the headphones, not even a tiny scratch. All cords were present. Quite a deal, so give that a try if you're up for it!UPDATE: These have outlasted the V-Moda M-100 for build quality. My V-Moda's started to fall apart around the metal hinges and are no longer wearable, or repairable, unless maybe you weld or duct tape them together. I have had absolutely no issues with the build quality of the ATH-M50x and I use them every day at work in front of the computer. Still very happy with the purchase of the ATH-M50x a few years later.

  I really like these headphones.  Not the best of its kind, but for the quality you get for the price, it's hard to beat.The materials are very comfortable and construction seems very solid.  They fold up nicely for storing and the multiple cables are useful.  Sound is great.  Very clear and detailed sound on a monitoring-like flat eq.  Soundstage is decent and provides full sound without an exaggerated range drowning out other details.I use this mainly for listening to music and my computer.  The 3/4 jack I'll use to plug into my keyboard or electric drums for quiet practice and sound quality is nice.  Don't work with my guitar amps though...  only play sound through one ear piece.I got white to be different, and dirt will build up on the head band, but just pay attention and clean it occasionally and it'll be fine.Overall, these are a great set of cans, for me at least.

",4.0,Johnny Bluejeans,"Reviewed in the United States May 18, 2018","









  
  
    
  The cord they come with is very heavy and it makes an audible vibration sound in the headset whenever it bumps into anything which is usually my desk. The default cord also comes directly down out of the left ear piece which collides with my shoulder frequently enough to notice, but it's not the end of the world.These are not comfortable to wear for long periods of time. I wear headphones for 8 hours at work and then I come home and wear headphones for another few hours. I can only wear these for around 3 hours before they really start bothering me and I am adjusting them constantly or just taking them off entirely. Prior to purchasing these, I used some steel series gaming headphones at home and work for many years and did not experience such comfort issues. I only stopped wearing them because their fake leather padding was making a mess everywhere and many were complaining.I can't quite put my finger on why they're just so uncomfortable. I want to say it is the ear cups and the pressure of the cups pressed on the side of the head. They seal really well, but just something about the texture and pressure is driving me bonkers. Maybe I should try the alternate ear cups you can purchase.The audio is not the issue, and is covered in enough detail by any number of other reviews.

  Switching to these from multiple ""Gaming"" headsets is insane, I have tried Logitech G933's, Corsair Void Pro's, Astro A40's, and probably 15 more at least. Over the span of looking for something with great bass, sound, and a mixture of everything. I had actually got recommended these headphones from an acquaintance, who is an audio engineer. I told him I originally that I wanted something wireless, with simulated 7.1 surround. For a while I didn't want wired, only wireless  due to moving around a lot, and in the past wired headset's wires have been very annoying.But after a good sale went on these, I knew that I had to pull the trigger on them to at least see if I would like them. These are the single greatest headset I have ever owned, The sound is mind blowing, something that you definitely need to try. These being wired have a ton more range audio wise, less latency, and more balanced sound that is not emphasizing the bass like those gaming headsets. These bring out true audio appreciation, I denied buying them for so long because I didn't believe they could be better. I was so wrong, Honestly the wires on these headphones I barely notice is there a lot of the time, Also not having to charge headphones feels so great.These headphones will change the way you think about audio, But also can be used for almost anything, gaming, music, etc. The Quality of these headphones isn't just the sound though. The quality, durability, design, and  compatibility is what makes these headphones so amazing. The earcups swivel, flip, and being collapsible makes them so amazing, they don't feel bulky or big when sitting around your neck with the earcups flat. It feels very nice.Out of the box Audio-Technica gives you a variety of cables you can use with these headphones, and also a very nice little carrying case is included to keep them safe, and neatly packed during travel. Another key thing about these is sound isolation is very great with these, but after a little while of use the cushions can become very uncomfortable, I have been looking into getting aftermarket ones. But the cushions aren't to bad for me.Overall:If you have been in the market looking for a pair of new headphones, Audio-Technica's headphones will not let you down. If you even think about purchasing these do it, you will not be let down by the quality of this product in every way. You'll be very satisfied and impressed with what you get out of these. You can find these headphones on sale if you patiently wait, that is another main reason I could not push myself to buy these. But after using them definitely do it!  I would definitely recommend these to a friend or anyone interested in a new pair of headphones that won't disappoint them at all! I hope if this review helped you make a decision, I hope you'll be as impressed as I was!

  So, you could say I'm a bit of an Audio Technica loyalist. I've been comparing their products to other sound companies since 2009 -- music really helped get me through my first trip to Afghanistan. None of my purchases with them have gone over $300, so as far as a company like Sennheiser is concerned, there's some limitations... But whether it be AKG, Sony, Bose -- I've had a history of buying two products from different companies around the same time to do a comparison. Why? If I'm going to be deaf by 40, I want to make sure I enjoy the sounds up to that point.Either way, I recently decided to hit the refresh with what goes over my ears. I'm guilty of actually returning to a using the Audio Technica ATH-AD900 (not with the X) the most over the last decade, since my original purchase forever ago -- YOU KNOW! The flashy headphones with that beautiful pink open-air siding! They're great headphones, still. Either way, to this product... Strap in folks, I'm not gruntled by what I've seen from other reviews.When looking over the critical reviews that seem to get helpful votes, they seem to float around the 3-Star mark, but for weird reasons. I read one that said too many of the headphone components were plastic. 1. What do you expect? 2. Did you take the headphones apart to examine the components that are actually producing the sound? 3. Not all plastic is junk, and while -- sure -- I can expect increased durability from a headphone frame made with nickel or whatever other metal alloy... If you can get at least three years out of your plastic framed headphones (almost every headphone has plastic on the market) without a break, that's a victory.I read another review that was critical of the bass for these headphones, saying there was none. That review floored me. While this is not a 1-to-1 comparison, I'm at the point with my current car that the sound system is worth a couple thousand more than the car itself. I have a great deal of appreciation for good CLEAN bass that doesn't obstruct the mids and highs that make musician's music *shine*... Y'all, these headphones have bass. They have bass not only where they are supposed to have bass, but in pleasantly unexpected places that in my opinion make relevant recent music better. For instance, for Lady Gaga's Stupid Love, you can tell that it is supposed to have a persistent and pleasant bass kicker going throughout the song. These headphones when NOT wired, accomplish making that kicker immersive... On their own... As in, you don't have to play around with the bass settings of whatever machine you're listening to music on, and I think that's effing fantastic.This is when I'm going to talk about why I'm actually really appreciative of these headphones. I originally wasn't going to leave a review yet because the first set I got in the mail was defective. One of the ear pieces was facing outside, which of course would make listening to music with both ears a bit difficult. Either way -- I said ""screw it,"" to give the quality a check after confirming getting my replacement through Amazon. (Thank you Amazon Customer Support -- Bezos needs to pay all you folks more than you do get paid). If we lived in some alternate dimension where I was a sports 'caster only being able to used a headphone and mic set on one ear, leaving the other exposed... I would write an angry letter to Audio Technica demanding why they made all other headsets disappointing in comparison. I say this while also letting you all know that I recently purchased Audio Technica ATH-ADG1X headset with mic.  Don't get me wrong, it's a solid headset that is built specifically for gaming and NOT studio production... But the M50xBT sound quality is in a different league. Whatever, besides the point.These headphones are great. I haven't tried listening to music with the aux cable in use. I think I read another review saying there is a difference in quality, as if that's a bad thing. Y'all, of course sound quality through a cable is going to be improved compared to something sent through the air-waves. Do you think the music your listening to on the radio is going to be the same quality as when you listen to it via disk, FLAC, or WAV? Come on... Please, appreciate the care that has gone into a good set of wireless headphones that still lets you plug in.So, yeah. I'm disappointed that I got a defective product from Audio Technica. I'm not going to hold it against them though because even if defective, I can still tell that it's a superior product, and I'm just going to treat this like a practical joke. Like, ""hahaha, Dillon, first time buying our wireless headphones, huh? You're late to the party, iDioT!""If you've made it throughout this entire review, you're a champion of patience.Also, I'm writing this review 8June20. Right now, a lot of people are hurting across the world for various reasons and the United States is not immune to the trials and tribulations of human struggles. However, some people experience unfortunate dispositions by being treated differently, and in many cases inhumane, just because of their skin color. I want to applaud Bezos for his firm stance on Black Lives Matter. Although, I think he can definitely afford to not only donate more money to the cause, but also pay his freaking employees more. While being employed is far better than unemployment, that doesn't always guarantee people will thrive or that their struggles will be greatly relieved.Dude, you bald Lex Luthor looking jabroni, pay your people more.TLDR: Black Lives Matter.

  Came with 3 cords and a carrying bag... Sound amazing. Bass isn't overwhelming but they are capable of some crazy bass with EQ adjustments via your output. Treble is nice and bright, dead on. Midrange is very present. Love the sound signature on these.Isolation is about 65% where 100% would be complete isolation from outside noise and/or sound leak from the headphones themselves. In a silent room there is some sound leak, and in a loud room I can hear the outside world at lower volumes. The isolation is sufficient for my uses, may not be for yours.Overall this is a great headset. Looks great, build quality is great and most importantly it sounds great.

",4.0,Douglas B.,"Reviewed in the United States November 24, 2016","









  
  
    
  Man....I so wanted to give these 5 stars.  If you've read many of the reviews, you will see quite a range of opinions on these...from the best things I've ever heard, to total junk.  The build quality is absolutely top notch in my opinion. Pretty comfortable for an hour or so, but after that my ears were getting sore. I may just need to get used to them...and they may form better to my head width and shape as time goes on.  I found the sound a bit ""muddier"" with more bass color than I was thinking/hoping.  But I'm getting to really like listening to a variety of music on them. Also using with my small studio with DAW and virtual instruments, drum machine, etc.  Not exactly neutral sound for mixing, but I wasn' t really expecting that, from reading the reviews.  From what I've read, the M40X would probably have flatter response for mixing or studio work. But I wanted the larger drivers and better build. A trade off.  Love the removable cord, and selection of cords and carry bag. Like the swivel cups and folding design too. Overall very happy. I'm no audiophile, and just wanted something better than the $50-75 phones I've been using over the years.  No regrets with these cans, and liking them more all the time I think.

  These headphones are pretty nice. At first I was disappointed with the sound because I was so used to low quality earbuds screeching at points and being too quiet in others. But these headphones are the same volume throughout a song.After listening for a few weeks I started to love how my ears were never ringing after spending hours at a time using them.You know how some people in YouTube videos apologize for the microphone quality, or comments saying ""RIP headphone users""? I'd wonder what they were taking about (haha). These headphones protect my ears from that.My siblings are always stealing these headphones from me and watching shows on them because they sound good.There're two reasons why I give these headphones a 4 star and not a 5.These headphones don't do a spectacular job of blocking noise, the main reason I decided to buy these. I commute by bus to my campus for 45 mins to and back (yup, pure torture) but I can still here the engine of the bus and outside noise. But it drowns conversations and tries to help me forget the guy snoring next to me.The second reason why I give this 4 is because I think these headphones can have a stronger bass. I listen to pop, Kpop, r&b, and for some songs I want to jam hard. I love how the instruments never overpower the artist (that's my pet peeve in headphones) but it would be nice if the bass was stronger.The sound doesn't leak until you go past 50% volume. If the room or library is dead quiet, having 45% volume is loud enough and no one can hear you (my siblings and I tested this for awhile).Trust me, the removable cord is a lifesaver. My cord ripped so I replaced it with one of the extra cords I got in seconds.Last thing about comfort. I wear thick framed glasses so I'd give it a 7/10 in comfort. They feel great without glasses on but that can't help me one bit 'cause I'm blind as a bat. I feel a little pressure where my frames are after an hour or two of use so I take them off for a while.I wish this review was more professional, but I'm a broke college student who got her very first pair of good headphones 😂 hope this review helps!

    Decent set of wireless headphones, but at this price there are better options.
  
",3.0,H. Hudson,"Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  To be clear, I purchased these specifically for their wireless Bluetooth functionality, and because much of the hype around these had to do with the sound quality and comfort.  Both of those things are important to me, and that's why I was finally willing to step up into a set of headphones that cost more than I'm comfortable paying.The sound quality was good, but if I'm being honest just not good enough for the price.  According to some reviewers, it is MUCH better in wired mode... But again, I specifically purchased these to be a GREAT set of WIRELESS headphones.And then the real deal-breaker, at least for me... This is quite possibly one of the least comfortable sets of headphones I've ever owned.  I have a cheap set of Bluetooth headphones, made by some private label vendor that sells them here on Amazon, and that cheap set is 10x more comfy than these.  The ear padding on these is OK, but the real sore spot for me was the padding that goes on top of your head.  Super thin, and it irritated me every time I tried to use them.  It did not take me very long to realize that this wasn't going to be a long term commitment.These things combined were just too much for me, and I ended up returning the headphones for a refund.  I am going to continue my research and try and find that perfect set of $200 headphones, but these just weren't it.

  These have been rated as best choice by scores of reputable review web sites. I've worn them for 3 to 5 hours per day for well over 2 years & have enjoyed every minute! To get a better pair of headphones, you'll have to spend upwards of $400. They're that good. if you don't have 'golden ears'  & deep pockets, these phones can't be beat. Very comfortable & the sound is stellar. After heavy usage for 2 years, the replaceable cable developed an open ground but the phones come with two cables - the other being  considerably longer.  I bought the NewFantasia Replacement Upgrade Cable model AT-2 because I wanted a shorter cable & it has proven to be a bit better than the original. You can buy these headphones with confidence that you'll be very pleased. HIGHLY recommended!

  I LOVE these headphones, they're my go-to at work. The addition of a microphone is great. I owned wired M50x before so I knew what to expect, however these have a bit more bass than my previous ones. They also are a bit more comfortable. Battery life is 40 hours as advertised, which is nuts. Even when I forget to turn them off, it auto shuts off for me and saves valuable time that I would have to spend charging them instead.

",2.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2019","









  
  
    
  In terms of sound quality, these headphones were certainly a step up from my 20$ Sony pair. They do offer substantial isolation from outside sound. This was in evidence when I wore them outside and felt the sounds of the bypassing traffic to be muted. But this isolation comes at the cost of significant physical discomfort. The earpads clamp down on the sides of the head with enough force to make wearing them for more than 10-15 minutes at a time a chore. If worn for too long, they are apt to give me a headache. Maybe it is possible that in time, they will stretch out a bit (maybe at the cost of some isolation?) but no one should undergo so much discomfort along the way. I find myself switching back to my cheap Sony pair often. In light of this, I see the benefits of active noise cancellation. Maybe headphones/earphones with ANC won't need to clamp down so damn hard to achieve sound quality.

  Best headphones for gaming I have ever had. It isn't super bassy but provides an adequate amount that satisfies. I've played Doom, BF4, Witcher 3, CS source and go, and they sound phenomenal. I came from the dark corners of gaming headsets, using A50s, Razor's 7.1 Tiamat, and Turtle Beach and none of them hold a candle light to these. Sound is crisp and can hear the softest of sounds. The soundtrack to the Witcher 3 sounds amazing giving it a different feel then before. If you are crawling out of that dark corner that I once resided in myself, ascend to greatness and buy these. It's well worth the buy. and for a mic you can always buy an attachment for like 30 bucks so you're good there as well.

  These things sound terrible. Excessive, bloated, woofy bass, distant thin treble, with nothing in between, and poor efficiency. No difference using BT or the cable, except there is some constant background hash added when the BT is active. Was looking for a decent wireless alternative to my shure SRH440s and I guess I will keep on looking. If people are making music with these then it would explain some of the regrettable mixing results out there. If you want boatloads of unintelligible bass, but only at levels your grandma would enjoy, these might be for you.

  Just about a year ago, I purchased these headphones used, but in good condition on Amazon.  Recently, one of the buttons stopped working, so I sent it to Audio-Technica for repairs. I expected to have to pay for the repair since I was not eligible for a warranty having paid. Unfortunately, the PCB was cracked, so the whole headphones had to be replaced, so the headphones had to be replaced, which Audio-Technica did at no cost to me as if they were under warranty. Audio-Technica Excellent customer service indeed! I would recommend to anyone.However, most people should not get these particular headphones. Instead, get some other ATH product. They have a VERY flexible full year warranty and are of high-quality. Don't get me wrong, the M50x-BT's are very good headphones, and I love mine, but they are more made for professional reference and audio mixing. If you want casual listening there are numerous other products that are more suited. The M50x's sound great and have very sterile and flat sound, which is good for technical applications, warmer and more rounded sounds are better for casual listening. I don't have specific recommendations, but other reviewers have given some headphones in the same price-range.

",5.0,Morbidcorpse,"Reviewed in the United States April 11, 2015","









  
  
    
  I initially purchased both these and the m40x to do a side by side comparison and ended up keeping these. The m40x are fantastic headphones, especially considering their price point. The m40x's are extremely neutral sounding, very flat.  Their bass is audible, though slighly relaxed.  That said, I prefer a little boost to the low end of my music and though it's not a night and day difference, the m50x offer a similar sound signature as the m40's but with just the slightest bump in the lower frequencies.  To me, this makes the music sound a lot more robust and enjoyable. I also found the highs to sound just a little more crisp with the m50x. Also, doing an A/B comparison between the two models with the same source and music, it was quite obvious the m50x were more easily driven, as well as driven to louder volume, than the m40x, likely do to it's higher sensitivity rating.  This may also explain why I found the m50x to have greater clarity at all volume levels, making them plenty adequate driven by just an ipod or phone.  Also, the m50x were better at reproducing a wide range of music.  I listen to the most extreme of extreme death metal (think Hideous Divinity) to the hardest hiphop I can find (Gotti, Boosie, etc.). But I also like Kelly Clarkson and Hank Williams Sr.  Literally all these different genres of music sound fantastic on the 50's!  I can't say the same of the m40x, which can sound harsh with certain genres of extreme metal.  You would he hard pressed to find a better jack of all trades headphones at this price.  I can't recommend them enough.

  I'd like to start off with I'm sure these headphones are great. However, the ones I received were an absolute nightmare. First off, when I opened them and tried to connect them to my PC via bluetooth the only sound it produced was a crackling and popping every now and then. After that I tried to use them plugged in. They worked slightly more in the way that there was far more snapping and crackling. After messing around with it for a while I ended up getting music audio to play, but no voices would come through. I thought that was weird so I googled and found a ""solution"" that required me to go through my sound properties and mess with the Left and Right audio levels. I messed around with different numbers and I figured out that 100 to 0 respectively got them to ""work"". I say ""work"" because it was quality worth about $30 tops. Would I recommend this? Probably not, I wouldn't want to be responsible for my friend getting a poor product. I will not be purchasing from Audio-Technica again. However, they did a great job at noise cancelling. So if you don't wanna hear anything at all they're perfect!

The ATH-M50x unit has a thick and sturdy metal headband that still maintains a firm grip on my head even after a few months of use. Also, the sound quality is muuuuuch better. I was listening to one of those 320 kbps songs from iTunes that I'd swear sound the same as any other 128 kbps mp3 from the 1990s. IT SOUNDS MUCH BETTER. I think I know what audiophiles are on about. I could close my eyes and almost see the individual instruments being played. Usually multiple instruments just kind of... smear into eachother, if that makes sense.

  The Audio-Technica ATH-M50x is the upgraded to the very popular Audio-Technica ATH-M50s with an improvement on sound and cabling system. They are one of the most versatile headphones on the market while being competitively priced. Whether you are video editing, doing music product, or just enjoying music, they will provide you a good experience due to the balanced sound. The lightweight and comfortable design provide hours of use with little to no irritation.One of the most important criteria when evaluating a pair of headphones is the sound quality. The M50x’s provide an upgraded modern compared to the originals. The sound is clear and balanced which is one of the reasons why these headphones are so functional. They have a significant amount of base that can be slightly overpowering at times. However, the base provides a great experience when playing video games, watching movies, and listening to most music. Overall, the M50x’s sound quality is excellent and it is one of the best-sounding pairs of headphones on the market.One of the biggest positives of the M50x is the design. They are an over-ear style headphone with large rotating headphone cups and a flexible leather top band. The large ear cups and the flexible top band provide a comfortable noise-isolating fit. A key feature of the design is the emphasis they put on portability. The headphones can fold into a small compact shape that allows for easy portability with the included mesh carrying case. While the headphone cable does have a proprietary locking mechanism allowing you to only use Audio-Technica headphone cables, it does come with three headphone cable variants including a 1.2 meter straight cable, a 3 meter straight cable, and a 1.2 meter coiled cable. It also comes with a 6.3mm audio jack that can screw onto all of other cables for professional equipment use.Arguably the biggest criteria when evaluating a product is the price. At first glance, one hundred and forty-nine dollars might seem like a lot of money to spend on some headphones, however, they offer better sound quality, overall design, good build quality, and comfort than anything else comparable at this price range.

    There are better options at this price point
  
",3.0,J. Hill,"Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2018","I recently needed to replace my pair of over the ear headphones so I began my search for a good pair of headphones in the $150-$200 range. Immediately Senhiser, Beyerdynamic, and Audio‑Technica stood out. I first received a pair of the Audio‑Technica ATH M-50x which had good sound but were very uncomfortable if worn for more than an hour or so. Then I picked up a pair of the Beyerdynamic DT 770. These headphones had amazing sound quality and comfort but the passive sound isolation was mediocre at best. Which is why I ordered a pair of the Beyerdynamic Premium 990 which are open back. I figured that the sound quality and comfort would be similar but the open back quality would allow me to talk with others while I played music. Unfortunately the 990's had worse sound quality than the 770 (a bit harsher sounding and not as clear) and were very uncomfortable even after only a couple of hours. During this time I also ordered a pair of Senhiser HD 599 headphones. While these headphones have a significantly different sound signature than the others I have tried, they were of similar quality. Overall the HD 599's were slightly less comfortable than the 770's but the open back quality was convenient and the sound was quite nice. I would have been satisfied with the HD 599's but they were the only pair of headphones I could not drive with my desktop. They produced terrible static. This did not occur when I used the 599's on other devices or when I used other headphones (even those with similar impedance and SPL) driven by my desktop computer. This prevented me from keeping them. I have attached a breakdown of my thoughts below:

------------Sound Quality------------

Beyerdynamic DT 770 (80 Ohm) - Winner
Highs - Quite good representation, much cleaner than Senhiser
Mids - Quite good representation
Lows - A little closed sounding but overall they are handled well
Overall this is how the music should sound. They perform the most similar to my pair of Martin Logan Motion 15's (bookshelf speakers)

Beyerdynamic Premium 990 (32 Ohm)
Highs - Similar to the 770's but rather harsh sounding
Mids - Nothing special, no major issues
Lows - Not as powerful as the 770's but more spacious. Seemed a bit washed out due to the open back design

Senhiser HD 599 (50 Ohm) - Close 2nd Best
Highs - Not quite as poppy as they should be. They are a bit muted in the sound signature which can make them less fatiguing than other, more analytical, headphones.
Mids - A bit to high level for me, it tended to make punk rock music sound very close and muddied
Lows - A bit boomy but very spacious

Audio Technica ATH M-50x
Highs - Quite good representation, a bit cold though
Mids - Nothing special, no major issues though
Lows - Too over-emphasized

-----------------Comfort---------------

Beyerdynamic DT 770 - Winner
Perfect. I wore these on multiple occasions for more than 7 hours and never noticed any pressure points or discomfort. The headband is larger than average to distribute the pressure. The clamp pressure is also a bit more than average but this was not an issue due to the soft, replaceable, ear pads.

Beyerdynamic Premium 990
I could not wear these for more than a few hours. The headband is made of a much harder material than the 770's and causes a painful pressure point on the top of my head. I believe this is made worse by the lower clamping force since more of the weight is on the top of your head.

Senhiser HD 599
I could wear these for several hours as long as I moved them around every 30-40 minutes. More comfortable than the 990's. Significantly less clamping force than the 770's.

Audio Technica ATH M-50x
These were the least comfortable. I could only stand to wear them for an hour or so before I had to take them off. All of the discomfort came from the top of my head.

These come with a permanently attached 10ft cable. That was a lot of cable to get in my pocket every time I got up from my desk. The cable also has more insulation making it much thicker and stiffer than average. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. But I could not hear others quite as well as I could with the HD 599's.

Senhiser HD 599
The interchange-able cables with different lengths worked perfect for home listening as well as on the go. The cable is also thinner and more flexible than the Beyerdynamic cable. The open back design was also a plus for me since I work in a semi-quiet office environment and I could still hold a conversation with someone while listening to music. The only downfall is the issue I had with compatibility between some devices and this pair of headphones where I would hear static or computer noise when driving them with a computer.

I really love the long coiled cable that came with these. To me this is the best option since I dont have to lug around a long cable or risk losing extra cables. With that being said, it also came with a ~ 9ft straight cable and 3ft straight cable if the coiled cable is too much for you.",Color: BlackStyle: Wired

I do video conferencing most of the time and a lot of music listening at home and on the road.I have a wired pair as well that I’ve enjoyed for several years.1.  Single Bluetooth pairing at a time.  I guess I’ve been spoiled by headphones that do the right thing with multiple devices.2.  Unreliable connect / disconnect cycle.3.  Not noise canceling.  I really missed this.4.  Poor build quality.

  Arguably the gold standard for “don’t buy a gaming headset, buy these and a mic”. They are a great quality set of headphones.Sound quality is fairly bass-heavy, with an emphasis on listenable, enjoyable audio as opposed to a totally neutral monitoring. They don’t require an amp to drive efficiently (tried with my phone, MacBook Pro, and finally with a basic headphone amp) but will certainly benefit from one. These are NOT a studio quality reference set of cans, as the aggressive “V” shaped audio signature is not ideal for mixing or mastering.They have a good soundstage for a closed back headphone, with a tasteful if not slightly “tight” midrange. They really are the last stop before headphones worth $100-$150 more.As for build quality, it is probably my least favorite thing about the ATH M50X — the plastic. While it is certain that the heavy use of plastic inevitably leads to their cost-efficiency, I find them a little light and with little metal, I know they will have certain joints that will fail before others.Outside of that, they are great. They have stayed reliably at the top percentage of headphones for a while and will invariably stay there unless there is a huge shake up. If you want neutrality, look at the Sony MDR-7506, if not, this is a great place to be.

    Great if not best sound. Cheap. But no USB Type C and software needs updating.
  
",4.0,Danny Glick,"Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2019","









  
  
    
  I originally had the ATH-M50X and none of the new headphones on the market really matched the sound quality. Even the expensive Sony or Bose. So I figured I would give these a try. I was concerned the sound wouldn’t be as good over Bluetooth and I had read about some issues with a faint buzzing. I’ve had them for about a week now and they sound exactly the same as the original so that’s a huge plus. Their is a very very faint hissing but only when no other sound is playing and it’s so minor you may not even notice it. However, their are two issues I have with these headphones and one other minor thing. Firstly, I don’t understand why Audio Technica didn't use USB Type C, it’s been out for years now and it’s extremely annoying especially because the headphones will definitely last a couple of years. Secondly, their is a software glitch where if your listening to music and then open a video, the second sound won’t play. It will pause the original audio but not play the second. The last thing is not a real gripe but I’m just saying I would prefer if ATH included a hard case and charged a little more. Especially since these are obviously targeting mobile listeners. People aren’t bringing Bluetooth headphones to the studio. The next iteration should really fix these issues.

    Amazing headphones for all-day listening!
  
",5.0,Christopher Randall,"Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2017","









  
  
    
  I'm by no means an audiophile, I just appreciate a set of high-quality and comfortable over-the-ear corded headphones to listen to music. I am a software developer, so listen to 4-6 hours of music every day, and sometimes 8+ when working on a deadline.A few times I've had to pause my music because I thought I heard a crash outside. After pausing my music, I figured out it was just the headphones and the way it distributed sound that made it sound like a cymbal crash or drum sound was actually outside my headphones. Sound quality is amazing. There are probably much nicer headphones out there. But, for the $150 pricetag on this set, I wonder if there is anything better.My wife got tired of hearing me complain about how uncomforable my Sennheiser HD-202 headphones were. I wear glasses while I'm working on my computer, and the HD-202s clamp my head pretty well, and put inordinate amounts of pressure on the temples and earpieces of my eyeglasses. So, she went onto Amazon and found this pair of headphones that had amazing reviews, especially from people wearing glasses while using them. I was a little nervous about the cost, they would be, by a LONG shot, the most expensive headphones I'd have every purchased. Then I thought about how many hours a day I use headphones and it became a no-brainer if they were as good as the hundreds of positive reviews claimed.I can vouch for how awesomely comfortable they are. A perfect amount of pressure to keep them on my head, but loose enough that even though the earpiece of my glasses are underneath, it doesn't cause discomfort. See the attached picture, you can see that the frames of my glasses are pretty wide.I also REALLY like how the cord works. It is a thicker cord, but MUCH lighter than other headphone cords. There is a long coiled cord, a long straight cord (both with screw threads for the 3.5mm->1/4"" component stereo jack adapter) and a third shorter cord. The short cord is the perfect length for me to have plugged into my iPod sitting on the desk next to my computer, I measured it out to about 4' long. There is no 1/4"" adapter threading on the short cord. I always hated how I had to coil my Sennheiser cord or rubber band it since it was 10 feet long! But, if I ever needed a longer cord, I could also use the straight or coiled cord.Amazing value, highly recommended!

    Neutral is the way to put it
  
",5.0,Mr. T,"Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2015","









  
  
    
  Let me first start this review by saying I am by no means an audiophile or anything. To be honest I probably wouldn't even be writing this, or have gotten this, if it wasn't for my old gaming headset finally breaking. I would rarely use that headset for anything other voice chat also, very rarely would it be used for music or game sound. I decided that I would replace it with something that I could use to listen to game sounds more clearly sometimes, along with music and voice chat. But really, anything is going to be step up from the game headset.I have to say that I'm fairly impressed overall with this set of headphones. I'm picking up things that, even with a decent 5.1 system hooked to my computer, I never noticed before. Like water on the other side of walls in games. Or a drum beat in the background that kind of faded in before. It really makes me excited and I can't wait to continue to explore these in use.Now I should also mention that I bought a pair of 

  
JBL Synchros S500 Powered Over-Ear Stereo Headphones, Black









  
  
    
   at around the same time (thanks to a good deal in a local store that didn't carry the M50s) and had those for a few days before the M50s arrived. So I did some of the same testing and exploring on them as I did on the M50 when it arrived. I have to say that even to my untrained ears I can hear the difference in sound quality and profile between the two. I believe it was said that these were the most neutral sounding phones on the market now, or at least in this price range, and I have to say that that is really the best way to put it. The 500s just seem more warm and rich, which is a plus for them in a sense, but ultimately I feel it comes down to having the right set of headphones for the right job, and something more neutral is going to be better for being able to tweak things down the road with equalizers and stuff.Speaking of tweaks and equalizers, in my (nowhere near exhaustive) testing one thing I was hook these into my computer (duh) and play around the sound card's built in equalizer and its presets/features. While by default the bass does seem to be a little lacking (though I can kind of tell it's there) it doesn't take much to start bringing it. Just a few little tweaks on settings, maybe enabling the virtual surround, and you'll see some nice differences. It wont get to the same level as others, including the aforementioned 500s, but I again feel like that ability to tweak is what really makes these a good pair of headphones in this price range.In the end I'm going to be keeping both of them I believe. At the moment I'm not 100% sure how much I like the M50s for music, where that warmth and bass can really shine and help. But I feel for use in gaming and the computer use I do that the M50s win hands down. Maybe this shouldn't be much of a surprise though since, in hindsight, it feels like the 500s were more made for music and smartphone/media player use (look at the cord) and the M50s were designed for audio mixing and the like. As the saying goes, pick the right tool for the job. But if you only had to pick one pair of headphones for everything, I would highly suggest this.

  Spending for expensive headsets when the last three went into the garbage before they were even six months old is getting to be a pain.Technicia for the most part gets good reviews, is half the price of what I""ve been spending so I decided to give them a try. The headband is made for big heads, my head is not small, nor large, it's medium. I'm thinking about super gluing padded fabric to make it more comfortable.The sound is kind of flat, but I will play with it for a while longer to see if I can get bass properly adjusted. Does anyone know if there are software programs available for Mac to adjust the sound?

",4.0,Se,"Reviewed in the United States August 7, 2018","









  
  
    
  Tl;dr - Upon plug and play, the left side was louder than the right. I gave the right side two love taps and that fixed the problem. I rate it 4/5. If I did not experience any issues, I'd rate it 5/5When I received my unit, I plugged it first to my phone (Pixel XL), and the left side was noticeably louder than the right side. I tried plugging it into 3 different audio sources: my phone (Pixel XL), my desktop PC, and a laptop (HP 15-au018wm). The problem persisted in the 3 sources.So I went and searched on Google if this was a normal quality of the ATH-m50xWH. After all the research, I decided my options were to either let it break in (as advised by someone in a forum) or get an RMA. I tried to let it break in first, but I got too irritated by the imbalance of volume after a few minutes. So, being the caveman that I am, I gave the right side two love taps and immediately, the right side started to modulate the same volume as the left side. A hilarious experience, I know but that should not be an experience of a consumer that purchases a pair of $170+ headphones. I would rate this 5 stars if the purchase did not include the anxiety and stress of contemplating if the left side being louder than the right is normal or was it just me receiving a unit with a defect. So I rated it 4 stars. Nonetheless, I've had lots of gaming headsets (both expensive and cheap) but the ATH-m50xWH definitely kicked their butts after 'fixing' my issue.

  I've had these headphones for about 3 years and they are very comfortable.  Although I have recently moved up to the very accurate PSB M4U-1 Red headphones, available on Amazon for about $105, the M50x's have done me well and I will keep them.  They are a warm sounding headphone that basically have a response curve that goes from roughly +5db at 50Hz to about -5dB at 10KHz.  But there aren't any serious peaks or valleys in the curve so they are very easy on the ears.  They seem to be tough and reliable.  I'm glad I purchased them way back.

  I have a giant head, it is over an 8, an employee at Lids measured it once and said he had never measured a head that big. Another customer that was watching just said, ""daaaaaang"", looking on in awe.Any way, if you have a head as big as mine these headphones will not work. I did a lot of research and purchased them because sights I read said these were great for big heads. The band pushed down on the top of my head and I had a headache after five minutes or so.So, why the five stars? While I had m jammed on my head they sounded terrific. Take that with a grain of salt as I am not an audiophile by any stretch of the imagination, great sounding to me is not having static.If you are looking for headphones that will fit a big head, these are for you. If you have a gigantic head, you should probably avoid these.

    Audio Technica, Beats, or Bose???
  
",5.0,James Jowers,"Reviewed in the United States September 10, 2015","









  
  
    
  I had been researching for about two weeks on which headphones were the best choice for me. After reading hundreds of audiophiles reviews, I decided to give these a try. I ordered the ath-m50x and the ath-m70x. The m50x are a better choice for people looking for an amazing balance in listening to all genres of music. The bass isn't overwhelming like the beats and the m70s are more a studio recording headphone. The m70s sound more clear, but your bass is essentially dead. If you just want to hear the singing and any high pitched string or synthesized  sounds then go with the m70s. If you listen to everything like most then go with the m50s. You wont be said!!! The greatest part about them is that they really seal well so that noise around is cut out as much as possible. Its not as good as the Bose Qc25 active noise cancelling, but better than any of the Beats active noise canceling. The best part is that you don't have any batteries to worry about as well! Also for those that want an inline mic. you can get one that works with the m50s/m70s. They have ones for the iphone. I haven't found any for the android yet. If you have an android, buy the iphone inline mic ones and usually the only buttons that don't work on the inline mic are the volume buttons.

  First of all, I have never liked big brands like Beats and Skull candy simply because I feel that they hardly match the value for the money we spend. Saying that, while going for brands, I considered brands like Audio-Technica, Sennheiser and Bose while choosing the headphone. Checking through the headphones at the local store, I found these best for under $200 (Being on student budget, that was the best I could spend). Following are my views on it:PROS:1) Great sound quality and bass effect (for someone who is an EDM fan like me)2) The padding near the ear is really comfortable with a cushion kind of a feeling3) Noise cancellation is one of the best4) The price has decreased almost 33 % (I bought it for $180)CONS:1) The headphones being a little bit heavy, the ears hurt after prolonged use.2) It doesn't have an integrated microphone3) No volume control on it.So to wrap it all up, they are the best for their price range. Audio Technica is a great brand which gives you a good value for money. My recommendation would be to also buy the protection plan for $10 more so that you can have a warranty for two additional years.

I occasionally notice a slight lip sync issue but usually I have to look for it to realize it’s even there.

  The sound quality these headphones produce are probably the best you can get for this price point and probably all you really need. The music and sound is balanced down to the middle, so you hear everything as recorded. These headphones are very comfortable when you break them in, if you have bigger ears these might not be able to fit you however, as my ears are just small enough to fit right in the center of them, so if your used to something as big as razor krakens these might not be as comfortable. however the cushions are very soft once you break them down! audio technica are a big brand for a reason, these headphones really sound like they were meant to monitor sound. ive also seen popular internet figures wearing these headphones as well after i noticed the silver pieces on the corners of the left and right on the headband. so all in all, these headphones are perfect for people who enjoy quality music, without any biases in the sound!

  This is the second pair I've owned after the first one broke. My previous pair was used daily, or technically nightly for about 4 years. During chemo, I'd had horrible tinnitus and developed a habit of needing to listen to something via headphones to drown out the ringing. Chemo and tinnitus are long gone, but the habit remains. So, they are comfortable enough for me to sleep in but they do take a while to break in. Until then, they do feel a bit tight on the ol noggin.

  One of my favorite pair of headphones I’ve used. I wish they included the longer spiral cable that they include with the non Bluetooth, but not really a problem. I typically use these either wired to my piano or wireless for zoom calls or music. The sound quality is great, whether wired or wireless. I do like how they don’t need to be charged to use them wired many headphones with active noice cancelation require a charged battery to listen, even while on wired mode. These headphones are also very comfortable, I have worn them for several hours without any problem.Edit: dropping it to 3 stars. My problem is the cable. AT elected to offset the 3.5mm cable slightly on the body. Now, I see no purpose of this except to limit the number of compatible cables down to 1. Previous headphones I have owned with 3.5mm connections, one could simply buy any 3.5mm cable that fits their purpose and it would work. However, audio Technica essentially sunk the port into the headphone body, meaning every 3.5mm cable I’ve tried gets blocked by the plastic /rubber cable housing. Do, rather than use my 10’ 1/4 inch to 3.5mm cable, I must use that cable in addition to a coupler, which reduces the sound quality. Very annoying.

This is an important quality for normal human use.  A lot of ""high end"" headsets are indistinguishable, for normal people, to a headset like these.  For listening to music and sound accuracy, these are simply amazing.  They are not insane bass headphones.  The bass is good, but it's normal good, it is not amplified to ridiculous levels like some headphones.  The sound seems neutral and relatively balanced.  The sound is much more detailed than any other headset I've used in the past.  There are smaller details on a lot of the music that I listen to that I never noticed before.  Again, this is from the perspective of a normal human with normal ears, so there is a good chance you will be able to have the same results.Noise cancellation I gave a 4 star because they do block a ton of sound but are not active noise cancellation.  So there is room for improvement but they are still very good.  Normal people won't have an issue with this I don't think.  One thing to note here is if you have ears that stick out these will be uncomfortable.  The pads are comfortable enough, but the foam over the speakers are irritating on the ears.  This doesn't bother me because my ears sit close to my head.  Your mileage may vary here.For gaming I gave these a 4 star.  It's hard to rate these for gaming, because gaming is not the primary purpose of these headphones.  They are a 4 star for me, personally.  It honestly depends on what you are looking for in a gaming headset.  If you are looking for sound accuracy these are amazing.  If you want massive explosion booms with overly loud bass in call of duty, these might not be for you.  If you want overly sensitive and loud treble so you can hear footsteps from a mile away, these are not for you.  To be clear, these do both of those things, but they do so in a balanced and accurate way.  These are not ""competitive"" level for gaming.  However, if you play casually and not competitively, these are an amazing set for gaming.  These will produce a more natural sound, which is something the vast majority of gaming headsets do not do.  Most gaming headsets focus more on treble for competition.  They do not offer a natural sounds.  One could argue this headset is closer to how the sound designers intended you to hear their games than a gaming headset, counterintuitively.Who are these for?  These are not for professionals or audiophiles.  These are for mortal listeners.  If you are a mortal listener, you can easily tell the difference in sound and appreciate what these have to offer.  You absolutely cannot say that about a lot of ""audiophile"" headsets that cost a ton more.  This headset is good enough for anyone to appreciate the difference in quality.  These are not for people who need a non-balanced sound.  I am not criticizing the need for those kinds of headsets at all.  They perform their function well.  This is not one of those.To sum this review up, these are incredible headphones for the value if you want a balanced, accurate, sound profile.  These are ""just buy it"" quality for normal humans.

  These are just so good. The sound is amazing, but beyond that, they are the only headphones I can wear for hours on end. I work in a relatively noisy environment and these block out a nice amount of sound by simply putting them on. Furthermore, the soft feel of the cushions is just so good.I recently got a second pair of these for my home office and while the leather on the cushions is still being worn in on that pair, they are just so comfortable to wear.The cord is detachable, and three cords are provided: long (good for connecting to the rear of your PC and having room to roll away from your desk), short (for mobile devices), & coiled (like an old telephone cord).

I'd say there's a bit more intermittent disconnects than with my $30 BT5 running in-ear pair, but it only happens on very busy street corners in NY from major interference which happens with all BT headphones so I wouldn't send them back to for that. If they ever come with an updated version maybe shield the receiver better from interference.

  Many moons ago, I used to DJ as a hobby and of course had wire headphones.  Great sound but of course life changed and at work, I found the wireless noise canceling to be very much my peace and comfort that stripped all the noise away which was honestly godsend.  Recently I started doing more video work and of course that meant, noise cancelling headphones weren't exactly the best quality listening device never mind what I wanted to hear through my Sony a7R iii during a shoot.The box, the packaging, three sets of quality cables that are thicker but soft so I can enjoy them at my computer without a short cable or use the short cable on a trip.  Granted, there will be times I'll use my Bose wireless so it isolates a lot of the background noise but with this studio monitor, I can still hear the background noise when I don't want to be startled (yes, I can turn off the noise canceling in Bose as well I know).The sound is just amazing.  I didn't think it would make this much difference.  I can only imagine how great some of those $1,000+ headphones can be.  In either case, for the money, I don't think you can go wrong even though if you're an audiophile, you already know everyone has different hearing so it's just one of those things you may like it or prefer another set of headphones.I've always preferred the design that cups your ear as I can wear it for hours.  Definitely worth the money for this pair!!!

  I initially purchased this and then had the dreaded ""buyers remorse"" for not buying the V Moda LP2, which had awesome reviews.  So I ordered the LP2.  Well the LP2 is about 5X more sexy-awesome cord, awesome packaging, seems more robust, but the sound is muddy compared to the ATH-M50X, and although I realize others disagree, to me the bass is actually not better-and if you are buying a headphone it is not about the packaging, it is about the sound quality.  I am critical, have probably $ 10-15K in stereo gear-Perreaux amps, pre-amps-lots of vinyl, etc. so maybe I do not represent the typical buyer.  The AudioTechnicas are accurate, at least for an inexpensive headphone, and I would highly recommend them.  Period-end of discussion.

  These a solid pair of over-ear cans for under $200. If your budget was $250, then I'd recommend the V-Moda m100 over these.I had the m100s for over 5 years and needed to replace them (long story) so I bought the ATH-M50x after reading the reviews.The M50x is a geat headphone. Build quality is pretty good, sound reproduction is very good and they are fairly light for their size. They also fold up and cups rotate and fold 180 degrees.Cons of the M50x:- Proprietary cables, meaning you can't just replace these with any 3.5mm cables.- Comes with cheap faux-leather case- A lot of plastic- thin headband (oddly, the headband is thicker on TOP of the frame rather than the bottom where your head touches it...)- Shallow earcups/earpads (my ear touches the driver)I give the V-Moda M100 a 5/5 rating compared to these due these advantages:- superior build quailty, more metal and still relatively lightweight- 3.5mm input allowing any generic cable to be used (on either earcup)- look amazing and are customizable- 50mm drivers (more bass-heavy sound)- comes with high-quality hard caseIf all you care about is sound and are on a budget, then you can't go wrong with the M50x. If you have a $250 budget, then I would definetly suggest the V-Moda M100 over these.

  I'm really pleased with these headphones. The sound quality is really great. They're not 100% at noise canceling though. So with Voice Over work, you'll hear outside noises while recording. They definitely deaden outside sounds, and you can't hear anything else when listening to music.They're pretty comfy too. I did wear them for several hours with my glasses on while working, though and I got a bit of pain above my ears where the headphones pressed my glasses into my head. I don't know if that's avoidable.They're very good looking, and come with three long cords for what you need.Overall, I think I could have gone with a cheaper set, as I'm not a total audiophile. But even I can tell the difference in sound quality between these and my cheaper ones, so I'm happy with them. Here's hoping they last!

  These headphones are very good quality for the price (better than a lot of higher priced ones too), ultra reliable and sturdy, and very versatile depending on what application you're using them for. I just bought these after one of the hinges broke on my first pair - A pair that I have owned for over 4 years and put thousands of hours of audio through. The pleather earpads and headband will wear down and deteriorate over a long period of time and make your ears very uncomfortable, but there are fortunately many different replacement earpads out there.After perusing around for something new for a few minutes, I came to the conclusion that my money would best be spent on a second pair. By far, these are my favorite headphones of all time, and their sturdiness alone makes them a good investment.

",5.0,AmazonCustomer92,"Reviewed in the United States May 3, 2016","









  
  
    
  Any audiophile/audio engineer/music producer worth their salt knows that Audio-Technica is a top brand for studio monitor headphones in both quality and price, and therefore value. This model is no exception; they are a classic in the audio world and continue to live up to their name. You can find the hard data on this set of can's frequency response and whatnot online, and I suggest that you do since you probably have unique needs for your headphones if you're considering one of these (they're not 100% flat and do have a little extra bass but for my purposes this works as a compliment since I use other sound references too and the boosts aren't extreme). I use these primarily for making and mixing music but also for recreational use. The sound is clear and loyal to the source; just listen to a variety of professionally-made music with these for a while first so you can get used to its ""personality"" and from there you should be able to make great mixes that work well on all types of speakers/headphones. These headphones are still very comfortable after hours of use - and that's with me wearing glasses! Fatigue is minimal, especially compared to other headphones in this price range, and they do not weigh down on your head or crumple your ears to fit in the cups. They also look and feel great, so the aesthetics match the quality. Having a detachable cable to the headphones is a huge improvement and both of the cables that come with this product are quality and of generous length - I can listen to music and dance around the studio with these still connected to my computer, no problem! The jack is 1/8"" but there is a 1/4"" adapter included which is very useful. I've used these headphones for listening, making, and mixing everything from jazz to rock to rap to electronic to country to reggaeton to pop to... you get the picture. Definitely check these out, they're the best set I've had the pleasure of using in this price range since they perform at a level that would be competitive at higher prices. It would sincerely surprise me to find out that someone did the research on these before buying and were not content with their experience afterwards.

    GREAT headphones, but come with some serious considerations for PC Gamers
  
",5.0,Rick Masters,"Reviewed in the United States February 15, 2018","









  
  
    
  I use these headphones for PC gaming.  I recently switched to these from ""gaming""  branded headphones, and the difference is mind blowing.  I have a $160 SteelSeries headset, as well as similarly priced headsets from other brands (Sennheiser, Razer), and I can't believe what I was missing.  There are sounds in games that I didn't even know existed in these games.  I'll avoid the more studio-oriented review parts as there are plenty of glowing reviews of people using these headphones in amateur and professional settings.I did a TON of research on headphones and audio, and finally settled on these due to the overwhelmingly good reviews across the web.  A lot of review sites put these on par with high-impedance headphones that are several times the price.  The thing you need to understand about monitor headphones is that they are designed to play audio as unbiased (true to performance) as possible.  Most consumer headphones, especially gaming headsets, have very distinct V-shaped sound, which means they put a lot of emphasis on the highs and lows and reduce the mids.  The most noticeable example to describe what monitor phones do is that the vocals in music will be much clearer and easier to hear, and the whole audio track will sound more ""balanced"".  You'll notice this in video games too, as you'll hear a lot of things much more clearly and distinctly, and you'll actually hear sounds that you didn't hear before (this is due to the smoother signature).If you are looking at these headphones for gaming, stop thinking and hit the buy button.  I won't sugar coat it, the sound these headphones put out will come as a shock, and you may not like it at first.  I personally loved it, but I have some experience in recording studios and knew what to expect.  If you have mostly been using gaming headsets or common consumer headphones these will sound really weird for a while.  But listen to some of your favorite songs on them for a while (or play for a couple of hours on your favorite game), and then switch back to your old headphones.  You'll realize just how terrible sounding your old ones are, and will wonder what else in life you are missing out on.I only have one major complaint about these headphones, and that is the ear pads.  I don't know why headphone manufacturers refuse to invest in good ear pads, but they just don't.  Luckily, there exist after-market ear pads that I would recommend and use EVEN IF these ones were awesome.  No matter what headphones you use, pick up some Brainwavz Hybrid Memory Foam ear pads, they are life changing.  (If you are a hardcore audiophile, these will slightly alter the sound stage, but not necessarily in a negative way).Another consideration worth noting is the intended use of these headphones: Studios and DJs with dedicated audio equipment.  These headphones will work fine just by plugging them into the back of your computer or iPhone, but they will absolutely SHINE if you put a good DAC or audio interface between these headphones and the audio source (I use a Roland Rubix 22, highly recommend).Obviously these are headphones, and not a headset, so they lack a microphone.  If you are considering these, you may need to consider an external microphone in your budget.  As you can imagine, between a good audio interface, a mic, peripherals, and these headphones, you can sail right past the $160 price tag on these headphones just to get to where you were, functionally, with a similarly priced gaming headset (I spent almost $800 to replace my $150 SteelSeries Arctis 7's).  So my final thought would be to thoroughly research the ENTIRE audio set-up you want before hitting the buy button on these.  You'll need to get good equipment and properly budget to maximize your sound experience, but it is a life-altering experience, so if you can swing it, do it.

  I listen to music all day at work. I have a 2 hour period every day where I can have both ears occupied with headphones. I've been using Skullcandy Titan's for the last couple years. I've always wanted a good pair of over the ear headphones so I can completely zone out my surroundings and get lost in the music.I did a lot of research and kept on finding myself back to these. I did want the 50x over the 50's for the detachable cord.When I first put the on and listened to the music through them I felt they sounded great, but didn't feel like the quality was overwhelmingly better than my silly little earbuds (boy was I ever wrong). I got to work the next day and first thing I did was throw these bad boys on and listened to music for 2 hrs (it was amazing). For the rest of my work day I take calls out of one ear and listen to music out of the other ear. I stuck my earbuds in and listened just for a comparison. My earbuds sound like garbage.. Seriously.. listening to them back to back, the difference is night and day. The quality these things posses is MILES ahead of my silly little earbuds. They are super comfortable for 2 hr+ listening sessions as well. And when everything is said an done, they fold up painlessly and fit in their little bag great!While I do like that they came with a carrying case, I will most likely get a hardcase to transport these in eventually. The case is good for what it is, but the headphones take up a lot of space and it wouldn't protect them in the slightest if they were to take a tumble in the case.I love them though. Very impressed!

    Very Good Headphones
  
",5.0,Devin Hoebeke,"Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2018","









  
  
    
  First off, I would like to point out I have not had much experience with higher tier headphones, so my review might be a little biased.Before owning these beauties, I had a pair of Sol Republic Tracks. When I owned those headphones, I thought they were very good. The bass was way more punchy than the M50x, but they were still clear and sounded great. I thought they were high quality. That was before I had these.Those eventually died and I found myself on the hunt for another good pair of headphones. One of my friends had recommended these. I read the reviews and they were good but they were $150. As the broke college student I am, I did not want to pay $150. But after quite a while of looking I narrowed my scope down to the M40x or the M50x. I saw a lot of reviews saying that the M40x has a better value than M50x and that there are not many differences between them. I should note that this pair comes with a reasonable size cord for like your phone or a laptop unlike the M40x which only come with 2 long cables. I have never tried the M40x so I cant compare the quality of the two. I obviously ended up buying the M50x.These headphones are very good. The built quality feels very nice and sturdy, and the headband and ear pads are very comfortable. I love the lockable and removable headphone cord. The sound quality is great. The highs are clear and crisp with no distortion at all. The bass in these pairs of headphones will not be punchy and you will not ""feel"" it. However the bass is very clean and noticeable. These headphones in my opinion is a damn near perfect balance of the treble, mids, and bass. These headphones are also able to collapse. This feature I honestly think is a blessing. It allows me to store it in my backpack so much easier than my last pair, and makes my life easy when I need to put them away quickly. The ear cups rotate 90 degrees each way which is very helpful if you wear headphones around your neck a lot like me. I do not regret buying these what so ever. They blew my mind and exceed my expectations. If you are looking for high quality headphones without going too expensive, I recommend these. They are great for pretty much anything and I do not think you will be disappointed. These headphones have sold my soul to Audio-Technica. As sorta a techy geek I knew Audio-Techinca was a good brand. But God damn, they make some great products.Overall, the headphones are great. They sound amazing and feel great. I recommend to anyone looking for a great pair of headphones. At $150 they can seem a little pricey but I will tell you with confidence, they are well worth it.

  The Bluetooth stopped working after a month and a after couple months the pads got worse and the sound deteriorated a little. I have had these headphones since July and while they sound amazing, the bluetooth stopped working after a month. The reason may be because I hooked them up to an amp during that month but these headphones are expected to be used with amps from what I have read so I personally feel it is not my fault especially after using them for months. On top of that the pads clearly need some work as I now have dents in the right pad and I have read that they will eventually flatten. Lastly, I noticed that the sound has slightly deteriorated, but I will be nice and say that is my fault for constantly using them with an amp. I really wanted to give 3 stars but the fact that the bluetooth stopped working after a month is a big no no and I spent extra on these instead of the standard pair of these for that sole reason.

  I did a lot of looking around for headphones outside of Amazon reviews and this set kept popping up in forums as one of the best, others costing a lot more than these. I'm not an audio technician, just somebody who appreciates stellar audio quality. It is amazing how well they perform, almost too good that I can hear background sounds not meant to be heard in recordings of music or audio books. The build quality is great and I am a big fan of the detachable cable that can easily be replaced if it wears out or breaks. On that note they came with jack size adapters and extra cables based on needs of the user (different lengths and a stretchy coiled style cable). The way the headphones rotate and fold up for storage was cumbersome at first but has become second nature in how they unfold and fit on my head, and the rotation helps them fit any shape or size head you have snuggly and comfortably.

  Tight on the head but once you break them in it's fine. The sound quality is phenomenal. There is a little bit of a buzz when the recording you listen to is off. These are meant to detect faults in recordings and they live up to that exactly. They have a very balanced sound and do not compress or amplify anything. If you're looking to record these headphones are perfect, and stylish. They are not meant for casual listening but I do it anyway and it still sounds good for the most part, unless there's a bad recording. These go over the ears, and the padding stays on well, and doesn't chip. It comes with a little drawstring carrying case and 3 different cords(you have to lock in the cord to the headphones, and it stays on great. Cord is very thick and sturdy) I've used them everyday almost for months and I haven't had a single problem, I will update if I do.

  Before I bought these I used the m20x’s for about 6-7 months and I really wanted to upgrade my audio from there. So I decided on prime day when they were for sale for $111.75, that it was the time to buy them. They came in the mail, right before I had to leave for work. I wanted to get a feel for them so walking into work I listened to a lot of the music I play all the time and I legit said “Holy shit” the sound difference is night and day. The blows are low but they are just the right amount, the highs aren’t too tinny, and you can just get a fuller sound out of them. I use these for basically everything I do as well. Gaming is awesome and I can pick up on enemies walking around corners and I’ll be able to accurately depict where they are. For music production these are fantastic as well. It comes with three cords, I haven’t had problems with them so we’re squared there. They’re comfortable, stylish, and they have a very attractive sound signature.

My wife was stressed out and worrying about stuff, and I stuck these on her head and played a few songs she likes (Jane Monheit, Ingrid Michaelson...um, Josh Groban). She doesn't get all excited about premium sound quality, but she said she might not give these back to me.I'm spending the night (now that the kids are down) playing through my library. I have stuff ranging from jazz to pop, rock, bluegrass, country, classic rock, acapela vocals, rap(-ish...ok, not really ""rap"" per se, but with some beats), Christmas tunes...you name it. It all sounds really good. Great spread out sound and realistic reproduction.Couple thoughts I'm still working out:1) I have a pair of Etymotic HF5's (in-ear) that were the most shocking discover after years of Apple iBuds. That's basically my ideal sound signature - very flat curve and true, tight reproduction of lows. These ATH-M50x's are more ""fun"" to listen to in general, but I am a little overwhelmed by the heavier bass. A little louder and looser than the Ety's. This might take some getting used to, but it's not distracting. On some stuff, it sounds really killer where you want to feel that deep punch. The Ety's don't inflate anything - they just give you clean, accurate bass. Clearly, these are not as unbiased.2) One of the main reasons I bought these was to have a better pair of headphones for our digital piano (Roland HP305). I was using some cheapo $15 headphones that sounded really blended and distorted. It was like one big messy note even though I would be playing a chord on the piano.  These ATH-M50x's give a much more distinctive sound to the notes and the sound reproduction is nicer. HOWEVER...because these are so clear, I now notice the reverb effect I was using, and it's a very echo-y and hollow sound reverb. I turned off the reverb to give a fuller more realistic piano sound through the headphones. In other words, these are so clear that the artificial feel of some effects really becomes apparent.3) For the digital piano discussed in #2, the headphones are quieter than the cheapos. I turned the volume dial on the piano board all the way up just to get it to a good volume. I think this means I may need, eventually, some sort of amp (DAC??) to power these drivers a bit more. I want to get the impression that I'm playing an acoustic piano. I think I'm partway there, but just need more amplification to get it right.

  The Audio-Technica ATH-M50x headphones certainly have a lofty reputation.  This is my first experience with them.  I’ve previously owned a pair of Onkyo cans that have wonderful sound, but faulty cabling undercutting their desirability.  The foam on the ear cups adorning Monster’s DNA Pro tears easily, so they’re a nonstarter for me.  I love Grado headphones, but they’re openness makes them unsuitable for use in public places, lest you want the world to know you like listening to ABBA.  Alpha Design Labs makes two headphones, the fine ADL H118 and the upscale H128 and the latter is an absolute knockout.  Still, the H128’s metal design and circumference doesn’t lend them to portability.  I’ve finally succumbed to purchasing the ATH-M50x after reading effusive praise from both connoisseurs and laypersons.  The acclaim is well deserved.  The headphones are comfortable to wear, compact and sound splendid.  The sound is bright with mildly accentuated treble, decent midrange and good bass… but not overpowering. I’d resist deeming the ATH-M50x as neutral sound due to their inherent brightness, but they clearly won’t engender listener fatigue as other more dynamic cans do.  The soundstage I was hearing using lossless files was quite expansive.  The ATH-M50x also seems versatile, able to handle a variety of music genres.  The cables are proprietary, but Audio-Technica thoughtfully provided three different variations so they’ve got you covered.  It’s easy to see why everyone likes the Audio-Technica ATH-MX50x.  After listening to them I said to myself… what’s not to like?

    Not much reason to use in wireless mode
  
",3.0,Anonymous,"Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2019","









  
  
    
  I haven't seen anyone mention this, but for some reason while in Bluetooth mode and there's a brief moment of silence of about 1 - 2 seconds, the very next sound will cut out and there will be a slight static noise, as if the headphones are coming out of sleep mode. This is the case for both my PC and my Android phone. I've managed to mostly eliminate this effect by using Voicemeeter. However, unfortunately you cannot use the headset mic at the same time as the headset while using the program.Currently, I use the V-MODA BoomPro mic in conjunction with this headset and it works great, however this makes the headset wired. The headset sounds a bit better while plugged in as compared to wireless, though the wireless mode still sounds great. I'd imagine some people may not even notice the difference. I also didn't notice any delay while wireless. I rated 3-stars because I currently don't have any reason to use the headphones in Bluetooth mode due to the issues I mentioned above.

  I am venturing into the DJ / Composer arena, so I thought it would be a good idea to replace my old Sony MDR-V600's, and am I glad I did.  After a quick web search I discovered that the Audio-Technica ATH-M50x always ranked very highly in it's price range.  In fact, many reviews suggested that you get more for your money with these than other brands.  I tend to take a function over form approach with most purchases, but I feel like I'm getting the best of both worlds with this purchase.  All I can say is WOW, they're great!!!  I had no idea what I was missing in sound quality.  I can now hear details that went unnoticed before, so these headphones will definitely enhance my ability to generate quality results.

  Isn't as high tech as a WH-1000XM3 but that is OK if you don't need noise cancelling. The stock pads are meh! I suggest getting brainwavz lambskin or suede or even a cheaper alternative is Gesongzhe pads which are on par with brainwavz. I personally use the Gesongzhe microsuede and they are super comfortable, the bass is reduced but present. I also have the protein leathers and the bass is increased with those. My work mate uses the brainwavz angled lambskins and they are also very nice and make everything smooth but I am not a fan of the angled hybrids.Sound: Overall better than the Sony's or any of the ANC headphones.Range: The Sony's win but it's still decent range with these.Build: These are plastic but good quality and roubust, they feel more solid than the Sony's.Noise cancelling: Not really here but ok for a closed back.To sum it all up if comfort and music quality is what you want then these are it once modded with better pads. The WH-1000XM3 are kind of the tech king right now and if you need ANC then get those. These will wipe the floor with almost every BT headphone out there for music quality and I haven't noticed any lag watching videos.

  I would say that I'm a semi-audiophile. I had been waiting a while to jump on a new pair of headphones because I wanted to make the right decision.I can honestly say that these are both comfortable to wear and sound fantastic. They are very true-to-sound and don't have a particular lean when it comes to trebles, mids, or bass which is great. That said, if you care about sound stage, these might not be for you. Although they aren't terrible, you could get a much better sound stage with open back headphones.Since I plan on using these for normal listening sessions and traveling, I did not want open-backs. They also have a pretty sturdy plastic build, which is great in my opinion because they are light and comfortable, and are great to travel with. I don't have to worry about them being fragile or accidentally breaking while traveling.Style-wise, I think they look pretty cool and it's a nice break from the ""trendy"" beats style that you see everyone wearing.As for the cords, I loved that it came with three different cord types. As I previously mentioned, I'll be using them when I travel, so having an extra cord or two laying around is a great plus.

  This was probably one of the best purchases of my life so far! Extremely versatile, comes with a lot of cords to match different occasions. The sound has just the right amount of bass to where you can feel it, but are not overwhelmed by it. I have just purchased the Sennheiser 598c and these headphones in terms of versatility outclass the 598's. I use these to play games and listen to music on my PC and I am on this thing for HOURS! Never really feel any discomfort and after 2 years of fairly heavy daily usage, this thing is still pumping the jams! Can not recommend these enough! Especially if you are looking to get a nice starter audiophile level headphones. Perfect price range for performance!!

  Ok, this is a bit long but I’m so happy listening to my entire music collection right now, and here’s why... So I bought what I believed were a good set of headphones a while ago... Feb of 2015 actually. It was a deal of the day, and an impulse buy. Spent a bit more than I had wanted to on a set of headphones, but with the deal on Amazon, decided it was a good price and a fraction of what I would ever spend on a set of Beats. The Audio Technica ATH-M50x headphones arrived and I never opened them. I put them to the side, maybe because I was having remorse about spending the $ on a set of headphones I didn’t really need? Maybe I’d gift them someday? They sat NIB for more than 2yrs. This past weekend I finally decided to unbox them and give them a try... OMG!😮... WOW!😃 All the reviews I had ever read that swayed me to buy them in the first place were dead on... these are simply amazing! If you own a pair of these, then you know exactly what my reaction is. If not, then it’s like completely rediscovering your entire music collection! You’ve never really heard your music until you hear it through a set of these... why did I wait so long to open and use these?!?🤔😄

  I had a pair of M40x's before and ended up buying a 3rd party Bluetooth adapter for my commute. Worked great for almost 2 years until they broke. Saw the Bluetooth version for the M50x and had to try it.Oohh wweee these sound nice! What a nice upgrade! I didn't notice that these have Qualcomm aptX audio chips in them until I got it. So you get true HD 3D Surround Sound. I have an LG V40 and it has DTS:X 3D Surround Sound/Hi-Fi Quad DAC and it makes AAC lossless and WAV files sound amazing. I listen to heavy metal, deathcore, hip hop, r&b, rap, house, drum and bass, you name it and it ALL can sound amazing with the right adjustments and enabling those features. I love the optional 3.5mm audio cord that comes with it. Can use it on my Switch and other devices so the headphones become very versatile.The app kinda sucks on Android. You need location services and Bluetooth enabled for it to work IF it decides to even open. And then find your headphones... Takes about 10 tries. But when it does open, it can be useful to adjust numerous EQ settings and configuration.The battery is fantastic! I spend about 2.5 hours a day commuting on the train and I can go about 40 to 60 hours without charging these! However for some reason the headphones will report to my phone that it is almost dead about 80% of the time. Yet I can go 60 hours without charging? Not sure what's going on there but not an issue for me really since it will say ""BATTERY LOW"" when they are actually dying (you have 10 to 15 minutes left). A plus is even if the headphones are dead, you can use the 3.5mm audio cord that comes with it. Another note about Bluetooth is the mic: sometimes when you are listening to music and answer a call, the Bluetooth mic won't work unless you switch your call mode (Bluetooth to speaker and back to Bluetooth as an example). Rarely does it happen, but annoying when your boss calls you...The headband is comfortable and can be worn for a long time. However I am not a fan of how firm the cups are, so I usually buy third party foam cups that are a little softer. And they do a better job at noise cancellation in my opinion. I take the train so the noise cancellation is about 80+/-% stock, but with 3rd party foam cups I would say it goes to 90+/-% since these are passive noise cancellation (active is like Bose where there is a switch).Overall, I love these headphones so far even with the slight issues it has. They feel well built and the sound quality is superior. Replace the foam cups with something more comfortable and these will do the trick. If you have a device that has DTS:X or Hi-Fi Quad DAC then I highly recommend these to get the best music/sound experience. I wish I could give it 4.5/5 stars but I gotta give it the lower end due to the rare mic issue, battery status issue and the foam cups. 4/5Pros:-long battery life (40 to 60 hours)-superior sound-comfortable (stock: 8/10 can be 10/10)-optional 3.5mm audio cable-3D surround sound ready (DTS:X and Hi-Fi Quad DAC)-Qualcomm aptX chips (True AAC and WAV)-great passive noise cancellation with 3rd party cupsCons:-foam cups can be uncomfortable for some. I recommend 3rd party ones that are softer.-stock foam cups do an OK job at noise cancellation-the audio technica app gets 2.5/5 stars...-battery reporting status to Android Bluetooth 5.0 is funky-Bluetooth Mic is OK. Doesn't work on some calls and requires switching call modes. Rarely does this happen but annoying when it does.

    READ - HOW TO FIX SPOTTY BLUETOOTH CONNECTION
  
",4.0,Levi,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2020","This should be fairly self explanatory to anyone who uses tech in their day to day life, but I see a lot of people dogging these headphones and there is literally no reason to.

While slightly annoying, its not a major hindrance worth a 1 star review.

If on Windows PC and bluetooth audio is cutting out but have 0 issue when plugged in with wire:
1) Power headphones on and let them connect to your PC/laptop
2) Open Windows Bluetooth Settings
3) Click ATH-M50xBT under ""Mouse, Keyboard, and Pen"" and click ""Remove Device""
4) Click ATH-M50xBT under ""Audio"" and click ""Remove Device""
5) Pair and connect headphones to cell phone or other available device.
6) Disconnect bluetooth connection to headphones on cell phone/other device
7) Re-pair with Windows PC

Sorry MAC users, I know nothing of your OS but would imagine similar steps should help.
Hell this should work for anything that has a bluetooth transmitter that isn't failing.

Personal opinion after almost half a year of use, a solid buy that I don't regret.

Audio Quality: 8/10
Better sound in high end of frequency spectrum, lower frequencies are not as present as the wired model.
Significantly less volume than their non-bluetooth predecessors.

Material quality: 8/10
Light, cushioning is sufficient on headband and ear cups. Headband feels durable enough.
Included travel bag and wired cable with in-line mic are a nice addition.

Bluetooth range: 7/10
Able to move roughly 40ft away from PC before cutting out.

  Loved my ATH M-40x wired headphones so I decided to upgrade to this. All the features I loved about those headphones are present here as well. Great passive noise canceling helps me focus. Can operate wirelessly or with a classic headphone jack (m40x required a special chord, these use a standard male-male chord, good change.) When I turn them on they connect to my phone immediately. Only downside is that when my phone is in my pocket the audio connection occasionally drops out briefly. It doesn’t disconnect, just gets gaps in the audio. Curious to see if this will improve when I upgrade my phone.

    Static sound in right ear speaker using Bluetooth (both original pair and exchanged pair)
  
",2.0,James,"Reviewed in the United States February 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  There are a lot of the great (external) reviews on the ATH-MT50xBT, which highlight the excellent sound profile of these headphones. I was quite impressed by the crisp sound. This is particularly noticeable when upping the input quality, such as the lossless FLAC, such as a feed available at on online radio site, such as RadioParadise. You really can hear details in familiar tunes you never heard before. Extended battery life is also a strength.WEAKNESS/MAJOR ISSUE (present on both original and exchanged pair)The major issue I have is that there is a static noise that can be heard out of the right ear when using bluetooth (not present when wired). It is heard when you turn it on and when the music volume is low. Considering the likely user is purchasing ATH-MT50xBT for quality sound, this issue is likely to be something that bothers a lot of users who value sound quality. Sound is not really noticeable if volume is elevated.Communications with Audio-Technica help support through email resulted in a fast reply. They suggested to exchange the pair. Upon receiving the second pair, the same noise issue was present in the right ear.  Communication with A-T about the same issue being present in the second pair was, ""this is unfortunate, consider the ATH-SR50BT Wireless / Wired Headphones instead.""Looking deeper into online reviews as well as SEVERAL within the amazon reviews reveals other users have noticed this issue, sharing their disappointment for the presence of such a static background noise issue in an otherwise quality sounding headphones. For those potential buyers who feel they have sensitive ears capable of hearing the full spectrum (e.g, capable of hearing soft noises such as the slight buzz of LED lights) you are likely to be bothered by this background noise when using bluetooth.

  I would call these very subtle flat response headphones. Will take gobs of power. If you're looking for bass heavy ones, these are not the ones for you, like I said, very flat response.Update..After about a week, I have noticed lifelike sounds I never heard before, I watch a lot of YouTube, now I'm noticing what used to be inaudible sounds like a phone ringing in the background, kids sounds and animal sounds like never before. It's like 2 worlds, what the videographer intends you to hear but life happening in the background that wasn't intentional. I never heard these sounds on any other of my headphones! That's a FACT!But...I also have a Cambridge DacMagic XS inline. So, it may be the 2 together that's making the difference, I don't know but as I said I never was not able to hear these other sounds on my other cans even with the DacMagic XS inline. I heard the phone ringing, took off the 50X's and went to the phone, guess what, my phone wasn't ringing! A number of times this has happened with other sounds as well. Almost uncanny, now there is a play on words I didn't mean to do.Hope this helps.
