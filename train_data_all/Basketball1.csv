  Great basketball!  I read a lot of reviews and had it narrowed down to this Evolution basketball or the Wilson NCAA official basketball and ultimately decided on this one because of the reviews.  I'm not disappointed.  I have always wanted a nice indoor basketball.  We use it in pick up recreational games as the game ball.  I like the soft feel and it bounces very true.  The tackiness is about perfect.  I don't like balls that are too tacky.

  I love this basketball and so do the guys I play with. I bought one for myself 2 years ago, and it is still going strong. Everyone always asks ""Where's the Wilson? Because that's the gameball."" I had to buy one for my dad as well, because he was using a crappy indoor/outdoor ball and he ONLY plays inside. He has also gotten nothing but positive reviews.The ball is soft and has a nice feel to it. It is a little stickier than other basketballs, but it DOES NOT feel like a rock like other balls do. Even after 2 years of weekly use my Evolution is in great shape, and doesn't look like it needs to be replaced anytime soon.Save yourself some grief, and buy one of these basketballs, you won't be disappointed.

  Our boys play travel basketball, rec and school ball. We needed another outdoor ball and evo has always been our go-to. However, we ordered this ball in green and got blue. So my brother-in-law ordered one and had it delivered, in green, and AGAIN we got blue. So I can’t give any higher of a rating. If anyone that is looking to get a ball in their team color or one that stands out from your standard ball bouncing around the court, you won’t get that here. Two different Prime accounts and both with the same disappointment. The ball is still an evo so there’s that.

Sadly, I purchased one of those gimmick balls (Infuzion) that was great in concept but sucks in actual use.I recently picked up playing ball again and was able to convince myself that a personal ball was needed even though my gym provided me with a loaner.The grip on this thing is fantastic and reminds me of the soft touch of a luxury vehicle seat. If you are willing to spend the extra bucks, get this one and show everyone how awesome you are.Be warned: If you go play a pick up game, everyone will gravitate towards using this ball. Don't take it with you if you are the type of person that doesn't want dirty paws touching it.

Shortly after, I took it to the gym and immediately noticed the ball was lopsided. I tried every fix in the book but the ball cannot be fixed. Defective product. Waste of money.

  Ball has a great grip to it whether or hands are all sweaty or not! I suggest this to the new Spalding TF 1000's by a long shot, and so do all my friends, as whenever I brought it to school, all the players on my team wanted to play with this for practice.I wouldn't suggest using it outside, as if dust gets onto it, it's impossible for you to grip the ball and dribble/shoot. Also it will wear down the materials faster.Great indoor ball, probably the best one, as it is always picked for game ball either in League games or Rec games.

   from a local sports vendor and I didn't like how ""hard"" the leather cover felt while shooting. It was the indoor version and was rated very well, but it just didn't have that nice FEEL to it. If you play basketball often, then you will know what I mean by that.I purchased this ball because it is a ball I play with often at a local gym and I like the feel and comfort I get in my shot. I got exactly that same feel and comfort in this purchased product and I don't think you will be disappointed in this purchase. The ball becomes even more versatile and shooter friendly the more you play with it, so give it a couple weeks before you decide whether or not you love it.

  Played college point guard and I can instantly tell the difference between a symmetrical ball and one that is lopsided.  This one was STILL slightly lop-sided.  Additionally, I've played w/ other wilson balls that had an amazing feel--this one felt like a rock, very hard, didn't have that sort of nice malleable feel to it.  (The leather felt ""cheap""--that's the best way I can describe it).  It was ""okay"" but for the price I was expecting much better ($60.00).  I also bought the spalding ball for $30 and this one has a way better feel--despite it being slightly lopsided as well.  But I'd rather two spalding balls at $30/piece than one wilson at $60.00--so I'll be returning this one.

  Evolution is about the best out there and we can say it lives up to its ratings. Yes, 50 bucks for a ball may sound high but you get super quality and it will outlast a ton of the cheaper balls.

    Best indoor basketball, period.
  
",5.0,Jeff Lee,"Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2013","









  
  
    
  As with every product I buy, I do a lot of research before I make my decisions. I've been a basketball player all my life and the last ball I owned was the Wilson Solution (the official NCAA ball). This ball, the Wilson Evolution, is the official High School ball. Without a doubt, these are the top 2 indoor basketballs on the market, period! Some people swear by Spalding, but honestly, the feel to their indoor balls is just different, and often inconsistent (and spending $100+ on the official NBA ball is just stupid). If you are wondering the difference between the Evolution and the Solution--they are essentially the same ball, but the Solution has moisture-absorbing technology, whereas the Evolution does not. This means the feel is just a tad different--I would say the Solution is a tad ""grippier"" than the Evo for this reason. If you are having a hard time deciding between the two as I was, I encourage you to try out the Evo. You will not be disappointed!Bottom line: For indoors, I'd rank the Evo #1 and the Solution #2. If you are a shooter, you will absolutely LOVE the Evo. It is always the game ball when I go play pickup games. NEVER use it outdoors, take good care of it, and it will last for many years!

  I think the ball is a great ball, the only thing that worries me is that it is already a little lopsided.  I have not played with it outside and I have not done anything but keep it inside and then take it to the gym when we are playing and it is getting a little lopsided.  I am not sure if I should send it back, but when you play with it, it feels completely fine and is soft and feels good...so I will see how it plays out over the next couple of weeks and see what I think.  FYI - some people really love playing with leather balls and this one is not leather, it is a composite leather.

  Overall this is a very good basketball and I am very satisfied with it.  It is not as soft as I expected and as I have felt with other basketballs but still soft enough to give it a very nice feel compared with most other basketballs. Also, I have felt other evolution balls that were softer than mine so it is possible it will break in some more and get even softer (I have played with it about a dozen times already).  Grip is great even with sweaty hands and has a great bounce to it (i.e. doesn't have that abnormally high bounce you sometimes get with other balls when driving fast down the lane).  Definitely recommended.

    Indoor Ball No Brainer
  
",5.0,Dougie S,"Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2015","









  
  
    
  In my opinion the best indoor game ball on the market.  I tried most out before purchasing 4 for my AAU team.  Spalding's have turned bad with cheaper quality, NBA game ball excluded but too pricey, and the only other ball I have used that compares in my opinion is the Baden Elite one.  My decision for team game balls came down to this and the Wilson solution though as area high schools use Wilson.  While the Solution is considered a better ball based on price, it collects dirt so fast with the moisture absorbing technology that the balls look worn down after a month's use and the kids always want to use the Evolution.  The Evolution keeps it color and has a soft grip so that you can at least get 2 years out of the ball looking new using it a few times a week.

  I play OMB (Old Man Basketball) 2-3 mornings a week.  I like the feel of this ball but I've never had one that loses air as quickly as this one.  It was a Christmas present and I started using it in January.  I had to pump it up a little once a week to get it up to 7-9 PSI.  Initially I didn't think much of it, just had to ""top it off"", but his week, it was completely flat after sitting over the weekend.  I pumped it up, and we played with it.  Now, 36 hours later, it's flat again.  I wiped some soapy water over the inflation valve and it's leaking around the side of the valve.  If you buy this ball, be sure to order an air pump to keep in your bag.  If it's like mine, you'll need it.

  My daughter loves this ball!This basketball (like all others) bounced because of the compressed air and gravity. When my daughter bounced the ball it went down - largely the result of gravity. When she bounced the ball hard, it went high. Win-Win!This leather ball also is elastic - the elasticity is the ball's property of being able to change shape when a deforming force is removed. When this ball's shape was deformed by hitting the ground the kinetic energy converted this deformation into potential energy and returned the ball upwards.  Bounce-Bounce!Meets all needs, makes baskets - definitely a winner!

    Best Indoor Basketball
  
",5.0,G. Fernandez,"Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2019","









  
  
    
  The Wilson Evolution Basketballs are the best indoor basketballs you will ever purchase and play with. I will cover some areas where they really shine:GRIP - the microfiber composite exterior works well to grip to your finger tips when playing indoors. Even if you caught some sweat on your hands from your match up or yourself, the ball simply ignores it and keeps great grip and gives you great control over the ball. This grip doesn’t degrade either as the ball sees continued use.DURABILITY - I go to a CSU and my schools uses these balls for their communal gym balls. They replace them every year and even still they don’t have to. The balls see use almost 18hrs per day every day and they hold up very nicely, no deforming or anything. If it’s just going to be you and a couple friends using it while you’re at the gym then it should last very very long. I will say though that misuse of the ball will lead to early deformation ie. outdoor use, slamming it against hard edges, etc...A tip I would give when purchasing one is to get a color other than black. Most everyone will get the black color way. While you can write your initials on the side of the ball, it’s much easier to distinguish your ball off the color of the letters on it. Plus it’s only the letters that are colored so it doesn’t take away from the orange/brown aesthetic of a basketball.

  I bought this because I liked the feel and handling ease when using my friend's evolution. The ball still works and I don't plan to return it, but the workmanship is off along several of the seams.

It still bounces well and isn't lop-sided, but I'm a bit disappointed in the quality as some of the seams protrude and will likely peel off soon.

",2.0,Bruce MC65,"Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  Very disappointed in Wilson overall. The new ""Green Color Logo"" ball I bought (to easily tell mine from others at the gym) felt much different than the regular black logo ball I bought 3 years ago (it failed because of air leaks). Colored logo balls cost $5 more, but is made differently/cheaper. It does not have the soft, semi-cushion grip the original has and feels hard like an outdoor ball. I emailed Wilsons' website and never got a reply. I just called them and the rep said the ""recipe"" was different now for the color logo Evolution balls (which is misleading at best as you'd expect it to be the same as the original). I'm hoping I didn't misunderstand and he was saying ALL new Evolution balls have been changed. I'll find out soon as I just returned the Green Ball and ordered a new Original Black Ball. If that feels wrong too, I'll warn others with another review. Not sure what Indoor Ball to buy if all Evolution balls have been downgraded in quality. Looked at them all and nothing looks great.

",4.0,Ahmed Ezz,"Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  I recently bought a Wilson Evolution (not online, but from a sporting goods store). When I get home, I realized that the air valve was notably raised from the ball surface and that it was separated all around from the material of the basketball itself, all of which seemed to be an obvious defect. I ended up reading a bunch of reviews online (mostly on Amazon) about the ball, and saw that many people complained of poor quality control, with issues like raised air valves, seams being sloppily glued together, and the synthetic leather surface peeling off. I also saw that people mentioned that the ball has a three letter code at the bottom of all the writing around the air valve, starting with either X or N, and that the N balls tend to be better finished. My ball had a code starting with X. I ended up going back to the store I bought it from and exchanged the ball. Interestingly, the store had a bunch Evolutions, and they were in three totally different kinds of boxes. I looked at least 6 different balls -- all the balls with the code starting with X had problems -- either the air valve was sloppily inserted, seams had glue or extra material showing where they met, or the synthetic leather surface wasn't glued down properly where it met some seams and you could see some of the white raw material from the underside that shouldn't be visible. There were two balls with the N code and both of them seemed pretty much perfect (the only issue with them is that where the writing is around the air valve, the surface of the ball is a bit indented/depressed, probably because of the printing mechanism they use -- it's a bit annoying, but I don't think it's a defect, and it will probably even out as I use the ball more. Plus, I'd rather have that than any of the problems I saw with the X balls). I'm guessing that Wilson must be using different factories and that's what the X and N codes mean -- seems like the X factory has terrible quality control (I don't think the problem is fake balls as some people have suggested, since all the balls I looked at were in store, and many still had problems). My new N ball is great so far, so if at all possible, I'd say make sure you get a ball with an N code . The only difference is the outermost layer thus this affects the dribbling critically . ALSO ,  the models of the balls sold on Wilson Sporting Goods Official site is :-Original color : WTB05_00RNavy : WTB05_95ID02Optic Yellow : WTB05_95ID03Royal : WTB05_95ID04Green : WTB05_95ID01Scarlet : WTB05_95ID05Laser Engraved : WTB05_00VImportant Note : there is no perfect Wilson Evolution even people buying it from the Wilson site complain about color fading and valve popping out even if you look carefully and zoom in the pictures provided on Wilson's website for the ball ( i mean marketing pictures you will notice that the black line are sticked to the ball using glue and that there are other glued partsin a nutshell there is no great ball at this price range if you want something optimistic pay an extra 10 $ to buy the NCAA Official ball or at least try to order the Evo from the wilson website

  Well, I ordered the Wilson Evolution in blue for my 15 year old brother. He lives with me so he will be opening Christmas at my house. The items were shipped to my grandmother's so that the kids would not find them. I go and pick them up to wrap them....AND YOU SENT ME A PINK BALL. THE WRITING IS SCARLET. I DON'T EVEN HAVE ANY TIME TO FIX THIS. It looks red in the picture but it is not. Any other color and we could have made it work. I am so upset. It was all he wanted and kept asking for. I had to scramble to throw Christmas together for him because he came to live with me right before Thanksgiving. I hope he is still okay with it but I can't imagine him being very excited to show his whole basketball team his ball with pink writing.

  I've played basketball for decades and this is one of the best indoor balls I've used. This was the third time that I purchased this ball. The first was for myself, the second was a gift, and this most recent purchase was a replacement for the first which got stolen :/When properly inflated, this ball has a soft feel with a good consistent sound and bounce. The only comparably popular indoor ball I've seen is the Spalding TF - 1000, though I've read that they changed the material and it just isn't the same as it once was. For my money, this is THE ball of choice. The only drawback I've seen is that it's so nice that people keep asking to borrow it.

  This has been by far my best indoor ball ever. I also have the NBA official ball but since I play basketball at the local 24 hour fitness, the floors aren't well maintained as the professional courts; so the ball hasn't broken in as I expected it. The Wilson Evolution is a different story, it has vastly improved my jump shot since the breaking in process doesn't take that long. Recommend this for all ballers and can act as a great Christmas present during the holidays.

    Bounce Issues with the Blue Ink Version
  
",3.0,Wallace Gustafson,"Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2021","









  
  
    
  My son plays so much hoops that he gets a new basketball every year. He loves the Wilson Evolution ball, it's very high quality and performs great. Rather than get him the same ball that we had over the past 3 years, I decided to get the Wilson Revolution with the blue ink (his high school colors). I don't know what the blue ink had to do with the bounce, but this ball does not bounce well at all. He uses it primarily for shooting drills, but he couldn't use it for ball handling. It's the weirdest thing, and it doesn't make sense that ink color would dictate bounce, but that's the only thing different between this year's ball and the three previous years.

    Not the same feel as a store-bought Evolution
  
",2.0,Britt,"Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2019","









  
  
    
  I’ve played with Evolution basketballs for years. For some reason this one is different. I’m not sure if it was because it was shipped instead of bought from a store, but I definitely feel a difference. During warm ups with about 4-5 different Evolutions it is noticeably harder and tougher to handle/dribble than the other of the same type. Players will purposefully pass up on shooting with it because they can tell it’s off. At first I thought it might need to be “broken in”, which is why I didn’t immediately return it. But now it’s too late and I unfortunately have an inferior ball of the same brand that I feel makes the best men’s basketball. Needless to say I was disappointed.

  We all know Evo is the #1 ball used in pick up games at your local gym. And it is just as popular in most rec leagues as well. My old Evo ball was on its last legs. And it was time for a new ball. I was a little wary about getting another Evo, over the years the quality of ball to ball varies. You can get a great ball, or you can get a dud. This being almost $20 off of retail price had me cautious. Because I was afraid of getting a crappy ball. But luckily, I hit the lotto. As others have mentioned my ball has the “N”  code on it. As there have been QC complaints with balls that start with a “Z” code.It’s soft, grippy, and I can tell right away before use that this will be a great ball. You’ll know right away if you got a quality ball.  My cousin just picked up a Evo recently but his ball feels way different.  The composite leather on his isn’t soft to the touch and has this “plastic” feeling to it. And the bounce of the ball is inconsistent. We starting playing with it at our local 24 hr gym and everyone complained about, so we had to stop mid game and switch it out to another Evo. And it was complete opposite. He got it at a authorized vendor, but like it said earlier it can vary from ball to ball.If you get a ball that stats with a “N” code this ball is money.

Everyone else sells indoor-outdoor (I/O) balls that just don't cut it for competitive play for girls our boys 12 and under.  I have used several full-size Wilson Evolutions, and they are the ball of choice at almost all courts.  They bounce well, have a good feel, and great grip.  They don't have the ""plasticy"" feel of I/O balls.If you're looking to purchase your daughter (or young son) an inexpensive basketball, go get an I/O ball for $20.

I can feel that whenever I dribble or shoot the ball...... Now I regret putting my name on it for not being able to return it I guess.......This suppose to be one of the best indoor basketballs.

  I ordered the scarlet red color for my son.  The lettering is actually a dark pink and probably better suited for a girl.  Its also made in Mexico, whereas the black lettered one (I bought in the store) is made in China.  Funny as it may seem, the one from China seemed to be better quality than the one made in Mexico.  Being that my son is more in touch with his masculine side, I had to return the PINK one and keep the black one I bought in the local store.

  The Wilson evolution is an excellent basketball... BUTTTT!!!!!! I was shipped a replica ball. It is not hard to tell-- all of the reviews stating that the ball was lopsided, or did not bounce evenly- were probably replica balls. You can tell if you have the official ball by observing near the needle inflation hole for ALL of the necessary writing. Please see the below picture for confirmation.

  Been using this brand of basketball for indoor basketball for years. No other ball comes close when it comes to comfort and grip, The surface of the ball is a bit soft but still offers excellent feedback, while minimizing finger jam injuries.Better wet grip than other balls, better than tf1000 from my personal experience because of the softer material. Still very durable as long as you keep the ball indoors only.Would not use this ball outdoors, seems like i'tll get ripped up.

  I debated long and hard to knock a star off because I was caught off guard when it came deflated out of box. It was also folded in on itself in a way it made it a bit difficult to pump air in it initially so it could finally get its shape (had to run to store for a small pump lol). After I got her pumped and to about 8.5 psi (pump at dicks sporting goods came with a sweet pressure gauge) I walked to my local park and put up some shots and I loved every single minute of it. Great ball. Great handling. Grip. Weight. Bounce. It’s honestly a fantastic ball so I’m giving it 5 stars regardless.

  I'm too old to be playing organized or even pickup games. I just enjoy going to the Y a couple times a week to shoot around for about an hour. This ball has provided me many enjoyable hours on a hardwood court for the past eight months. Since adding a little air to the ball after taking it out of its box, I don't remember needing to adjust the pressure since.If I ever need to replace this basketball or purchase another one for any reason (for indoor use, only), I will simply buy a Wilson Evolution. Though I did a fair amount of research for my initial basketball purchase, I will not feel the need to see if any better choices have surfaced in the future. I don't think it would be worth my time because I can't imagine being more satisfied with a basketball.

  Handling with the Wilson Evo is a pleasure because it is so soft and forgiving on your fingers. Other composite balls can be really tough on your hands and some balls can even scrape and cut your fingers. Not with the Evo, which is a pleasure to dribble and shoot with this beautiful blend of grip and accurate bounce characteristics. Your grip does change with additional sweating either, as the ball wicks moisture away from the seams. BTW,  i love the way the seams are laid into this ball. It is perfect. This is a great ball and I highly recommend it even with the slightly higher cost.

  Best ball in the game. I coach high school varsity and hold lots of workshops as well, so these balls get a lot of use from me and my boys. They hold up great with heavy daily use. That's important since I end up buying the balls myself for the school use.. Meant for indoor use only, and I have seen several reviews complaining they don't hold up outdoors. Please dont expect this to work on rough concrete!

Takes some time to break in, but when it gets broken in it gets so nice, feels so nice and natural against your hands. Definitely helps with ball handling / touch for shooting. I used to use the Spalding TF-1000 and swore by it, but they have since changed the material and the ball is not as nice. Wilson Evolution has become my go-to ball for indoor use(don't use this outdoors). I highly recommend!

  This ball is a great ball for indoor use and competitive games. I have used one of these for over 10 years playing basketball growing up so I know that these balls are great and durable. However the one I received had the black lines and some of the lettering peeling off. This is somewhat frustrating because without the peeling this ball is perfect and would last me years but because it was shipped to me already peeling it won't last nearly as long before it all peels off and looks/feels terrible when playing.

  The Wilson Evolution... bring this ball to pretty much any indoor recreational basketball court and it'll be the preferred ball for the game. It's soft to the touch, and if you like shooting jumpshots, you really get a feel of the ball when you shoot it. It's hard to put into words the satisfaction you get from the feeling of the ball leaving your hand, but this ball really makes it perfect. I haven't had the chance to try out the NBA official game ball (it's also twice as expensive), but for most amateur players like me, this will be your favorite ball.

  Good quality ball. Bounce feels great when dribbling. Very easy to handle because of the soft, tacky cover. However for those who grew up loving the old Spalding TF (not the new one posing as a TF), the Wilson ball will feel a bit mushy. Most people like the ball but almost everyone comments about how soft it is. Some love it, and some hate it. I think it is a good ball, but you will always find someone in the gym or on the courts who make a comment about how they loathe the soft, mushy feel.

A piece along the groove started getting loose after 4 weeks however it does not seem like a common issue. Indoor hooping is recommended. This is the ball everyone uses when playing pick up games, everyone who plays indoors knows about this specific ball. Sorry tf1000, during your hiatus in producing the original full leather ball, these have surpassed you as the preferable choice in basketball.

  The Good:You will not be disappointed. Micro-pebble fiber really makes a difference on the grip, and when you're in the game and your hands are all sweaty, you'll never have to blame a turnover on your slippery fingers again.The quality of the basketball is great for fifty dollars. I've been using mine for more than a year, and the material still hasn't worn down, or popped, or shown any signs of deflating. And I've used it a lot.Also, the basketball is ready to go right out of the box. No need to dig through the junk drawer for an air pump, because all you have to do is remove the box and lace up your sneakers.The Kind-of Bad:The Evolution basketball is for indoor use only. So that means, don't even think about taking it outside on a nice sunny day for a game of street ball. The leather, like almost anything, won't hold up against the blacktop. Believe me, I've had friends who have tried and had to ditch the Evolution for a new one in less than a month. A month is still a decent lifetime of continuous play to get out of an indoor ball, but for fifty bucks, I'd advise you not to try.Overall:You can't find a better basketball at that price. The next best ball is probably what the pros use and they cost over a hundred bucks. Sure, you can find balls for maybe half the price but you'll be throwing them away in three months. But if you want one that will last you a long time and make you feel like you're in the pros, then go with the Wilson Evolution. (SMD)

  The evolution ball is the best indoor leather ball (in the $80 and under price range) This is our 2nd evolution ball and I would recommend to anyone who plays indoors (Note - not for outdoors).  This ball is always selected as 'the ball' to be used in pickup and league games.  Just be aware due to the favorable conditions of the ball, it will be a target for some to take home for own (this is why we ordering a 2nd ball). The ball was $45 on amazon - no shipping vs. $59 the local sporting goods super store

  Best basketball there is... And everyone knows it, so make sure you write the owner's name all over it, in huge letters, with a phone number.  My son's name was on it, but fairly small, and didn't seem to matter.  It was stolen during a basketball game (probably from a disgruntled member of the team we beat).  They should put a GPS tracking device in these things, or module like a ""Tile"" or ""Cube"" inside, so that you can activate it and make it start beeping loudly.  I'd pay another $10-20 to have that (and I would appreciate some royalties from Wilson when they do it).  :-)Great ball... just keep your eyes on it at all times!

  Great feel, weight, color, etc. But this is my 3rd Wilson. Evolution I've bought and this one is way more poorly co structure. The black channels were not matched up well along the edges of the orange 'leather' sections.... So when you spin it in your hands you can feel weird edges instead of smoothness. Not good and that will likely cause the ball to wear out faster and fray in those spots.

    The ABSOLUTE best indoor ball! After 1000's of reviews, and a lot of playing - I gaurantee it!
  
",5.0,Scott Robison,"Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2015","









  
  
    
  Absolutely the best Indoor Ball on the market! When I first touched this ball, it was at a pickup game and after 5 minutes I knew I had to have it. It was the best ball, with the best feel I had ever played with. Not only have I played an incredible amount of basketball with LOTS of different balls. I am also an incredibly skilled researcher. I literally went through 1,000's of reviews for every ball made under $100. So when I say this is the best reviewed ball that is being made, it's means people who have purchased every top name ball on the market (Solutions, TF-1000's etc.) are also saying it's the best and the one that will get picked to be used the most when playing. What's the point of having and practicing with a great ball if it's never used in any games! I also have owned this ball for about 6 months now and Feel like I can give it my wholehearted endorsement.FEEL:When I say it has the best ""feel"" of any ball I have ever used, hundreds of people agree with me. This ball has the perfect grip and softness and rolls perfectly off your fingers. It's has a little bit of give or sponginess in the leather which gives it the perfect amount of give on the rim, and also helps to give you that perfect grip throughout an intense game without getting slippery. Unlike many other balls where you feel like it slipped or didn't roll off your hand correctly, I know every time I miss with this ball it's because I made a mistake not due to any fault of the ball.ENDURANCE:This ball holds up INCREDIBLY well ""INDOORS"" on a swept court. This ball is indoor only my friends and if there are little rocks on the court it will get nicked. After 6 months of use I was playing the other night and after the game one of the guys picked up the game ball and was talking about my ""NEW"" ball. It looks and feels just as good as the first day I played with it....honestly it feels even better. Don't ask me how, but it feels better and better the more you play with it like a broken in pair of shoes.PRICE: ($55 when I purchaed it)If you are on Amazon, you are looking for a good price and convenience. The price is ABSOLUTELY worth it on this ball. Even if you buy cheap balls, this ball is worth it on Endurance alone. The quality is 10 steps up from a budget ball and by the time your budget ball would lose it's grip and wear down, you will still have this ball with great grip 10 steps above the replacement ball you would normally buy.This ball is AWESOME - Endorsed by hundreds of hardcore ballers. This is overall the best ball I have ever owned and more importantly the best ball I have ever TOUCHED or played with in any game. BUY WITH CONFIDENCE and know I already did all the research for you and I've had hands on experience with it!

    First Dedicated Indoor Ball Purchase
  
",5.0,J. Set,"Reviewed in the United States April 25, 2012","









  
  
    
  This is my first basketball dedicated only to indoor play. I always played with hand-me-down basketballs or gym balls that were torn up or with grip that was long gone. So when this ball arrived, I was surprised at the feel of this ball compared to the old and other basketballs I've played with, including new TF1000s.I researched indoor basketballs prior to purchase and settled between the TF1000 (ZK Pro) and Evolution. I ended up going for the Evolution because I had already played with new TF1000s and wasn't too impressed. The Evolution feels softer in my hand and seems to have a ""cushioned"" feel against my hand while dribbling and shooting. The TF1000 has a more solid feel to it and the grip is smoother. With that being said, both balls are great game balls, it just depends on your style of play.I recommend going to a sports store and trying both basketballs out before settling on one. I was lucky to play with TF1000s prior to buying my own indoor ball and I am happy with my purchase.

  For those hesitant to spend more than $25-30 on a basketball (as I was before I purchased this), I promise it's worth every penny and a much better value than a cheaper ball. I spent $50 on this and am still using it 15 months later.Really great all-around ball, have had it and used it almost daily (daily for the past six months) indoors since August of 2016. The grip is no longer good for dribbling so I decided it was time to try the Wilson Solution and retire this one, at least for daily use. What's impressive about how it's held up is that, while the grip is no longer there for dribbling, it still works very well for shooting and your fingers don't get burned from shooting it, even when I have shooting sessions approaching two hours. It also still holds air nearly as long as it did when I first bought it. Normally I toss my ball when I get a new one but this one will definitely stay with me for a while. While I've heard and read testimony that the Solution is a slightly better ball, really the only reason for the change is that the Solution (typically $70) was only $50 here on Amazon at the time of this review. I highly recommend the Evolution for indoor play, even daily.

  The Wilson evolution is amazing it makes training fun when you have a good basketball. Unlike other basketballs such as Nike, Baiden, Spaulding balls it has the right grip to it, it's not too hard but also not too soft I played with plenty different indoor basketballs and the Wilson one stood out the most because unlike other basketballs after a few times playing and dribbling on different surfaces the ball stays the same I can't say the same for others. I know for a fact I'm not the only person who enjoys playing with the ball whenever I go to the gym and me and my friends are deciding what ball to play with everybody chooses the Wilson ball over the Nike & Spalding balls. The condition of a basketball means a lot when you are an athlete and I can say for many years now I played with a Wilson ball and the condition never changes. I recommend anybody to get a Wilson ball over any other basketball because it stays in perfect condition and it is affordable as well.

  Purchase this ball at a sporting goods retailer or from Wilson directly. Price is the same everywhere. The Wilson Evolution basketball I purchased on Amazon was defective. This is normally the gold standard for indoor balls, especially in league play. I received a ball that was missing a letter oddly enough. It was printed with ""OFFICIAL GAME B  LL"" - no A. No joke.Since it was shipped loose in a box with no manufacturer packaging, I suspect this was defective merchandise purchased for cheap and resold at the retail price. Hard to believe that would pass quality control. Missing a letter is likely not an issue but for a $70 basketball, I was suspicious of any other less visible defects - internal, pump seal, texture, etc.

  This is my favorite indoor ball and is the gold standard in my gym. Occasionally we will use The Rock but I don't like it, the grip is not as good and I don't like the feel of it in my hands. I have also tried the Baden Elite - the grip on that is essentially too good, it feels sticky and does not release as well when you shoot. The Evolution is soft with the right amount of grip, and feels great to shoot. Of course, it does tend to get stolen way too much....

  I'm writing this review after years, because I'm sort of fed-up with the evolution balls that are sold on Amazon. I've had this ball for some time now. I used it very seldomly, but have been actively using it recently. I noticed that when I first tried to pump the ball for the first time, the insert hole would not take my needle as if there was something in there that prevented it. I had to wiggle it and get a perfect angle in order for it to be completely inserted. After some time of doing this, as the ball would go flat very frequently... the ball will just flat out go flat within an hour of playing with it. Another issue with this ball is that when I compare it to the evolution balls that other's have purchased via a department store, the grip is completely different as well as the softness of the ball. I feel like I got a cheap knock-off for the same price of an actual Evolution ball. Hopefully this will help the  next person that tries to buy this ball off of Amazon. It is clearly different and the quality is not the same.

  After having this ball for over 2 years, this version isn't the same as the other evolution basketballs. It's slippery, harder and quality is not the same as other Wilson basketballs. I can only say this might be a fake one. The pic is a version of a real one that actually feels grippy and soft and nice. Sad that I got a knock off, you can def tell by feel.

    Best ball out of the box
  
",5.0,Renaissance,"Reviewed in the United States May 21, 2014","









  
  
    
  I have owned this ball for about 4 years. I have played with other balls and still feel that this is hands down the best ball to bring to the court if you are a recreational player. I play about once a week and shoot around on occassion as well, so by now I'm just about ready to get another of these. The reason I like this ball over others that I have tried is due to the feel. The official NBA ball is fairly hard and slick until it is well broken in. Unlike other cheaper balls in many of the sporting good stores, the composite material on this ball gives it a slight tacky feel and incredible suppleness. It makes handling this ball a joy versus some of the other balls like the Nike Elite. In my opinion, this is the ball that most people on the court would gravitate to given a choice of balls.

  After reading all the reviews, this Wilson Evolution ball hits the sweet spot. This ball has a good amount of grip, nice balance, good bounce, and retains the air relatively well. I think I top off the ball about twice a year at most, while using it about 2-4 times a week. Whenever I bring this ball to the gym or to a local tournament, it is frequently chosen as the ""game"" ball so this ball has been used by a lot of ballers in full court games about 1-3 times a week for about a year. I baby the ball by ensuring that it is only used indoors, that noone sits on the ball, and I do a quick wipe-down with lukewarm water at the end of the day after every use. So far, the worst that I have are some normal scuffs from regular use but otherwise, the ball still performs just as well as it did the first day that I got it.I've asked folks how they felt about it after using the basketball. Most like it a lot. The few complaints that I got were that some guys would think it's a bit light or too grippy. I have to admit that it is a touch on the light side but no more than an ounce or so, if it really is a bit light. As far as grip, this ball definitely has some grip but it is not so grippy as to cut your fingers like the cheap outdoor basketballs. I think it has just the right amount of grip but everyone has their own thoughts. Most folks that I've encountered have not complained about the grip of the ball and, in fact, like the amount of grip.Simply put, this indoor basketball is highly recommended for anyone who wants a serious ""game"" quality ball without paying for the official basketball.

  I've been coaching AAU for many years now. We go through some balls. The $25 ones you get at Walmart last only a few months before the tackiness is gone, this is not a serious option for long-term.I used Spalding Legacies for some years, and I do like them and think they hold up perhaps best of all over let's say a 5-year stretch for a busy team.But we've moved the the Wilsons because the boys prefer them, they have a softer (much softer) feel. From my perspective, they hold up well enough, in the 3-year range, compared to 5-year for the Legacy, that if the boys prefer them, it is the right choice.

  I got the ball today.  The ball came in it's own box, the one you see at the store.  I like the feel of the ball, it's got this soft spongy feel to it. It's not hard like most of the ball I had used before. One interesting thing I had noticed was the black line is not rubber at all.  It's covered with the composite leather.overall, I like this ballnote - for anybody that is looking for a basketball, do not get the tf-1000 zk pro.  My local gym when it first open, got 10 of these, now, it's all scuff up and lopsided. I have no idea how it can be lopsided.  I never seen anyone kick the ball or taken half court shot with it.

None of their other friends/people at the gym have similar balls and it allows us to recognize their balls, which is great because so many balls have been stolen. The grip is top notch and overall it is a ball whoever is using will be envied for. The fact that additionly, it feels and handles like the ROCK ball make this the perfect ball.

  This basketball is superb.  It has the tack that you need to handle, and the durability to last for several seasons before thinking about a replacement.  It is a well made product that will make you happy for the purchase.Updates:-First ball purchased in April 2013 for $44-Replacement ball purchased in July 2015 for $55-Third replacement purchased in January 2019 for $59The first two are still playable and I really wanted to have a new ball for my weekly games and ad-hoc workouts.  So if I get  a minimum of 2 years out of the new ball then an 8 year investment in 3 basketballs is less than $20 per year and if you use only once per week each year the cost would have been less than $0.39 per week.  I’ll take that any day.

Well worth $45-50 --- wait for sales and coupons and cashback at various vendors.The grip is very good.  Not overly tacky, but controllable feel.

    Outstanding basketball! My #1 choice
  
",5.0,Benjamin,"Reviewed in the United States July 3, 2017","









  
  
    
  Although this ball is made in China, Wilson headquarters are a few miles from home, here in Chicago, IL.I play these balls in my gym, and they are great, I loved them from the first time I used them. I bought one for myself, and as other reviewers have noted, they are outstanding balls to be played on an indoors court. Do not play this on the street, or else they will last a couple of months. Otherwise, this is easily the first choice when it comes to a ball for any use other than professional NBA basketball (I believe they use Spaulding).I waited until the price went down, and I paid $41.41.The company claims the ball comes ready to play out of the box, but this was not my case. The pressure on my ball was 3 psi, when it needed to be 8, so I am happy I had my super kit ready to fix that (

  
Franklin Sports Ball Maintenance Kit: Pump, Needles & Pressure Gauge









  
  
    
  ) which I highly recommend you buy. This is nothing you should be worried about, as I am assuming mostly anybody has a gauge. Thus, I am not taking a star off for it, this is a solid 5 stars product that I highly recommend without hesitation. Great deal, and great ball!

    The best indoor ball out there.
  
",5.0,CJ1786,"Reviewed in the United States November 27, 2012","









  
  
    
  The Wilson Evolution in my opinion is the best indoor ball out there.  Playing alot of pickup ball at local gyms I've pretty much tries every ball at some point and this one is the best. Good grip, soft feel, and nice bounce.  This ball is not the top of the line Wilson, its just behind the Solution game ball which is the one they use for the Final Four games.  I've owned that ball as well and out of the box I'd give the edge to the Solution, but the problem there is durability.  While its a dream when new, it will begin to get slick and lose its grip much more quickly than the Evolution.  To me the Evolution, being almost as good a ball, with much better durability is the clear choice.

  This is a great basketball. I bought it for my sons for Xmas. They played with it regularly at the YMCA in Charlottesville until it was stolen from there. A kid brought a Sharpie, crossed out my last name (written too small by my son) and wrote all sorts of other stuff on the ball. The guy at the Y refused to review the tape, choosing rather to cover for thieves. Write your name BIG on this ball if you'll take it anywhere thieves play.

    Evolution is my group's favorite ball for indoor pick-up games.
  
",4.0,Greg,"Reviewed in the United States January 20, 2015","









  
  
    
  I run a community basketball program for Seniors. I purchased a Spaulding TF-1000 Classic and a Wilson Evolution from a sporting goods store to allow my group to compare the balls. Everyone loved the Evolution, the Spaulding is rarely used. So after one Saturday session, I purchased 2 more Evolutions for the  group through Amazon. They've been a huge hit. The balls have a nice feel to them, they're a little softer than the Spaulding. I can't comment on how they might last under constant use, it's only been about 2 months, but so far so good.Also, they were  $49 through here vs. $65 from the sporting goods store, not an insignificant price difference. I would recommend the Evolution.

  Great ball and love the feel! However...  This is my second one. Got a replacment after the first one became lopsided within  a little over a week....it's great in the beginning but not a couple weeks later it's already become lopsided again. I've taken care of this ball to the T. Never bounce it off the court, always bring it inside and placed on a shelf, never kick or slam the ball on anything. Don't know why they become so easily lopsided? In any case, great ball though a little frustrating that it's an expensive ball and doesn't hold up for very long.

  Currently I have this Evolution that I ordered here from amazon, another one I gotten from Walmart, original tf-1000 I bought used from Ebay, The Rock, and the Bade Elite basketball.  There seems to be different colors from the amazon one to the walmart one.  Anywho, people who are saying this must be a bad batch or whatever might need to reconsider.  Any composite leather basketball is going to feel slick and not grippable at the beginning.  This is the case for all the balls I own right now except for tf-1000 because it was used.  YOU MUST BREAK THEM IN!!  It doesn't take 1 day or 1 week, it takes months.  I'm talking about 3-6 month and depends on how much you play with them.  At first at the local gym i go to, everyone had the wilson evolution and it felt totally different with mine.  So I asked them where did you get the ball thinking that I had a bad batch or something.  It felt buttery smooth and felt like real leather and had a nice tact and feel to it.  They told me you had to break them in.  All these guys at least had the ball for 6+ month.  One kid had the ball for only 3 month and felt buttery smooth and i'm assuming he played alot on them.  The best wilson evolution ball I felt was a ball that a guy had for 2+ years.  It's the ball game every game because everyone likes it.But I would say out of the box, I believe the Rock had the nicest feeling.  It was the most tackiest and felt nice.  Of course, that ball has to be broken in as well and other people at the local has lot of the Rock as well and feels nice once it's broken in.

  Let me start by saying, I never write reviews. I'm the guy that just doesn't feel like it. However, I play a lot of basketball and feel the need to warn anyone looking to purchase this ball. I like the Evolution, it is the new standard at every gym I play at. I ordered this one with the green lettering, simply, so I could tell it apart from everyone else's because everyone has the same ball these days. As soon as I opened the box and took the ball out, I knew something was off. The ball looked small. There was no way this ball was official size (29.5). I hadn't even taken it out of the packaging and it could tell it wasn't. Once I took it out I compared it a to an official size Top Flight and it was noticeably smaller. I thought maybe it's the green lettering and an optical illusion, so I brought it to the gym to compare it other Evolution balls. Theory confirmed. Everyone I had look at it all said the same thing. ""It does look a little smaller"". It's almost it was 29 and not 29.5. I've exchanged it, but this time I chose the royal blue.  I'll update this review once it comes in. For the record, the ball itself looks and feels great, the size definitely threw me off though.

  Not sure if these were fakes or seconds or what but the quality of these balls was very poor. The seams were uneven, the ball felt dead even though inflated to proper psi. I have played with other Evolution balls and they were great. I compared this one to one my friend has (purchased at Dick’s) and you can clearly see the difference in quality. The Dicks ball has perfect seams none are raised or low, the ball has great responsiveness from the dribble and just feels like a much nicer ball to play with. I returned the first one I got and the second one wasn’t any better so I returned it as well. Ended up getting the ball from Dicks and that ball is nice.

  This is a great ball and one I order once a year. You'd be hard-pressed to find a better indoor game ball, particularly for the price.However, this particular ball that was shipped had a minor flaw. The rubber valve for the pump needles was manufactured poorly. It was slightly too small and also fastened to the ball too loosely. So after I pump it up and pull the needle out, air leaks out (more than typical) and the rubber protrudes from the ball just a bit more than it should.The ball is still playable, but the valve issue is noticeable while gripping the ball to shoot.

  This ball is worth the price. It is well made. The ball bounces with accurate integrity. The ridge that stretches from the back rib lines is smooth and allows an accurate bounce.

  My son (13) loves this basketball.  He says the coach always wants to use it for the game ball.  However, his advanced skills coach says the most important thing to consider when buying a ball is buying one you're willing to use anywhere (indoors and out).  He emphasizes the most important thing you need to do to get better is to practice.  Inside, outside, everywhere you go.  Get a $5 ball, wear it out and get another one.Having said that, I'm glad I got him the great quality ball for indoor bragging rights.

  Bought this for my 16 year old son who plays indoor and outdoor basketball. He specifically wanted this ball for indoor use and said it works great. He did have to add a little air to it when it arrived as he said it was a little flat. And he had to add more air to it maybe 2 weeks later. I asked him if there was something wrong with the ball (I know nothing about basketball but that just seemed like it was losing air too fast IMO) but he said the ball is used a lot so it's not uncommon to have to add air often. I'll take his word for it I guess. He said it's perfect for indoors, he can grip it well and it does whatever it's supposed to do. Previously, I had bought him a Spalding indoor/outdoor ball but he said that one was better for outdoor use after using it for awhile which is why he made me buy him another ball for indoor only. He seems to think basketballs are super cheap I guess but that's a whole other story. The reason he specifically wanted this ball was because when he was at the gym, some stranger that they were playing with had this ball and he liked how he could handle it better than the Spalding.

",4.0,Barry Louie,"Reviewed in the United States March 30, 2009","









  
  
    
  I am used to playing with the Spalding leather NBA balls, but gave this one a chance based on the rave reviews.  The ball feels tacky and has decent grip, but it still ""feels"", smells, bounces and plays like a synthetic ball.  I'm fortunate to have some hardwood next door to play on.  The ball shoots well because it has good grip.  However, I still miss the old Wilson JET and JET III balls from high school.  I think those were the best leather balls ever made, and certainly better than any ball Spalding, Nike, Molten, or Rawlings ever made.The Evolution is a decent ball, good, but not great.

  I love these basketballs. It's the only ones I used and mostly everyone else too. I wanted a custom color to help distinguish my ball from others. I write my name on it too but the color helps prevent anyone else from accidentally taking it. However, the red looks more pink. Everyone that sees the ball, refers to it as the ""pink ball"" and not the red ball. Someone even called it the 'Breast Cancer Awareness ball"" lol. I wish they had a purple one since it was my school color. The quality of the basketball is as good as you'd expect, just be aware if you're getting the Scarlet color.

  I've grown up using T1000 balls in middle school and high school basketball games, but this seems to be the go to ball nowadays.  Everyone at 24 hour fitness that I play basketball at uses this ball to play.  It has a nice grip when dry (not too grippy like rubber balls), has a good bounce (not too bouncy nor deflated), and it holds air very well.  I've had it for months and haven't had to put air in it yet.  It is not lop sided or goes lop sided easily like many balls out there do.  (spalding comes to mind)Make sure you keep it dry/wiped off, don't use it outdoors or leave in sun, and it should last a loooooong time.  It's always in the trunk of my car when I am not using it, and I park my car outside in the 100+ degree summer sun and this ball is still performing like it should.
