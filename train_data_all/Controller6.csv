    A great controller for Xbox and PC gaming
  
",5.0,Nicholas Muska,"Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  There are a lot of things to like about this controller. Right away you will be drawn to the Razer Chroma RGB with its clean bright colors. Holding the control feels natural, the size of the grips aren't too small or too large so you avoid cramping your hands after long play sessions. The grips are textured. The ABXY buttons are fantastic and feel more like responsive mouse clicks then the usual console controller buttons you have to mash. The swappable sticks and D-pad are great for different play styles. The triggers work well and can be locked to decrease the pressure needed to activate. The mappable functions and the stored profiles are also welcomed for creating different set ups based off of the games you are playing. One word of advice is that when using this on a PC you will need to install the Razer for Xbox app and physically use the controller itself when launching the app. The app will need an update on PC and if you attempt to use a mouse to follow the link it will not work. Use the Razer Controller. The price may seem steep but if you are serious about gaming it will be worth it for you.

  My husband had the old version and had that one for about three years before the sticks finally started giving out, this was after extensive use everyday. He upgraded to this one instead of replacing the old one and he loves it! He loves the built in chat pad with push to talk so he doesn’t have to mute and unmute himself fully all the time.

    Decent  controller/some issues
  
",3.0,Alex F.,"Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  I actually like this controller, but it does have some annoying issues. It mostly sucks for things not game related, like, picking a TV show and trying not to hit the buttons on the bottom of the controller when you put it down or pick it back up (kind of similar to a ps4 controller, but worse). This has stopped and started many a show on accident.Having a cord also kind of sucks for obvious reasons. It gets stuck on things. The cat wants to chew it. It's a strong cord with a great length, but it's really hard to pull out of the controller. That's the point, but I find that too many times the controller either doesn't sync with the Xbox upon starts or restarts (sometimes the controller is on but not functioning), and unplugging it and plugging it back in gets annoying. I bought it because it was cheaper and I wouldn't have to charge it, but maybe pay the extra money to skip cord issues.I play COD with it, and I like it overall. The joysticks are really responsive, I like the ""quick trigger"" feature a lot, and the grips on the bottom are nice. I'm honestly still not used to the buttons entirely, and the extra xy bumpers are so tiny I miss them a lot. It's also too hard for me to try and use the buttons on the bottom and in the front in an easy way, especially with my left hand. Or, it's easy to use the bottom AB buttons and the triggers, but it's hard to reach other bumpers from a comfortable position. I'll generally default back to using the regular buttons on the top of the controller so I can use the bumpers more comfortably if I need to, but it's hard breaking old habits this way.I like the feel of the bottom buttons being set to AB, and the springyness of the regular ABXY buttons, but I still completely miss XY bumpers a lot because theyre tiny and in between bigger bumpers.I got the controller for $89 and I think if you wanted to try and learn this style of controller this is a worthy option. The cord is long and it fits snuggly into the controller, but, like I said, cord issues. I would probably just spend the extra $ for wireless personally.

    Who needs an Elite or Scuf controller?
  
",5.0,Curtis L.,"Reviewed in the United States November 21, 2017","









  
  
    
  I play mainly shooters on my Xbox One so I'm always looking for the best controller for me. Didn't want a Scuf as the price started get close to the $200 mark with the options I chose and shipping costs. I already own a Elite controller and it's better than the standard controller but I wasn't fully satisfied. Never got comfortable with the paddle placement on the back so I ended up removing them entirely. I see reviews for the Razer Wolverine and purchased immediately. Just opening the box you can tell it's a quality product. The build quality is top notch and it should last for some time. Feels great in the hand and I have zero issues with the extra button placement. Haven't hit them accidentally yet. Downloaded the Synapse app from the Xbox store and changing buttons and lightning is a breeze. The cord is very long (12ft) if I was to estimate and braided. Very well worth the price in my opinion

",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2019","









  
  
    
  Having used this controller for over three months now, I can say that it is one of the best controllers I've used on the Xbox One console. The paddles and additional bumper buttons are and responsive and easy to reach. Also, the added ability to turn the left and right triggers into hairpin triggers is an absolute Godsend, as hearing other folks owning similar controller products have to specifically request hairpin triggers, and that those hairpin triggers do not always work for certain situations in some games. The ability to remap buttons on the fly is absolutely amazing and easy to do, even when in the middle of an intense gaming situation. The Synapse app for Xbox one is very user friendly and snappy. Creating, editing, and duplicating profiles for various games is easy and quick. The one downside, that ended up getting better over time, was the D-Pad faces. The package comes with two different styles of D-pad, and both were very hard to break in at first; finding that, after a while of interaction, would start to hurt/cramp my left thumb.

  After breaking 4 Xbox one controllers I decided to try this Razer wolverine controller instead. I loved it instantly. The feel, the position of the buttons, perfect. The best way to describe it is an Xbox one controller on Superman vitamins. I don't mind that it's not wireless, in fact I prefer it because of the 1:1 input that makes the reaction timing instant...and yes you can tell. I hereby vow to never buy a cheap Microsoft brand controller ever again. I'm hoping this Razer wolverine doesn't let me down and holds up.

  This is a very solid controller for a very good price. It feels very comfortable in my hands. It has all the extra buttons and paddles that I like The button presses are all very solid I love the trigger stops and the RGB feature and the app for the Xbox are all very cool. Using the app you can program the RGB colors and what all the extra paddles and buttons actually do. You can have multiple profiles set to whatever. My only gripes with it is that it's wired and that it doesn't actually turn on the Xbox when you press the Xbox button, while the console is off. All very minor gripes in my opinion, well worth the price. I recommend this controller to anybody who asks.

    Connector for cord goes bad quickly
  
",1.0,Cassidy Bumpus,"Reviewed in the United States October 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  Worked really well for about 2 or 3 months then it started randomly disconnecting from XBox One. At first this was only if you angled the controller down. After about 2 weeks of that, it would only stay connected if the controller is held straight up and down so as to provide consistent tension on the cord connection into the controller. Now, no matter how you hold it, the controller will not stay connected. The cord has zero damage to it and both the cord and controller were stored very carefully. It appears the receiving connector inside the controller is bad. I figured a $100 controller would have significant warranty but I checked shortly after it started messing up and no dice!

  This controller is great. It looks good, responds well, and is obviously built of quality materials. However, it is NOT for large hands.

  The X button was malfunctioning right out of the box. Press it once and it would resister multiple pushes much of the time. Trying to play Apex Legends and it would drop 2 or 3 items out of my inventory with one push. I thought maybe it needed a little breaking in so I lived with it for a couple weeks but then it just stopped working all together at times unless I pressed the button hard. I couldn't get a replacement because they were out of stock so I'm doing a refund. It seemed like a decent controller so Im extremely disappointed and can't recommend it for the money.

    Pressing trigger interferes with pressing bumper.
  
",1.0,leomit,"Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2021","









  
  
    
  If you're a Devil May Cry fan, don't get this. Pressing down the triggers causes the bumpers to be very difficult to press unless pressed at a very specific angle. Any game where you would have to press down triggers and bumpers at the same time (admittedly few) will run into problems. I confirmed my brother's Tournament Edition has a similar problem, even worse than mine. The design of the shoulder buttons is in general just poor. The bumpers wiggle around a lot, and pressing them feels terrible, much worse than a standard Xbox One controller. They might be OK for most games, but for $160, why put up with such shoddy construction?

",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  This controller is exactly what I was looking for! I’d bought the Fusion Pro but the dpad was all loosey goosey - very imprecise - which is the opposite of what you want for fighting games (why so many controller makers design their dpad like a floaty joystick is beyond me). The Hori Fight Commander was out of stock everywhere I looked, so that’s when I looked into the Razer. So glad I did! The dpad is super precise - you’re not going to get any wrong inputs. Only negative might be that you have to press a bit harder than on the normal Xbox One controller - so you won’t be getting the wrong inputs but you might occasionally drop one by not pressing hard enough. The added precision is 100% worth that downside for me personally.Ditto all of that for the face buttons which also require a fraction more force to press - having a spongy resistance like a classic computer mouse click, as well as the classic mouse click feel and sound... for some reason. It’s odd but I kinda like it actually. I also love the lighter weight of the controller in contrast to the heavier Fusion. I read a comment somewhere that the Razer feels cheap, but I don’t get that impression. It’s light and that can only be a good thing for control, especially in longer gaming sessions.The customization is also excellent. Downloading the Razer app takes no time and offers a really quick and simple process for selecting your preferences. That LED band around the Xbox button? Never thought there would be so many options for that. Tons of colors and fun display options. The way I set it up the LED brightens in response to my inputs, which is something I never knew I wanted but is really cool. Assigning inputs to the extras buttons and the rest is as simple as can be.I actually prefer the extra buttons to paddles. Especially the two next to the triggers - very easy to press and has a satisfying click.Analog sticks are wider like the playstation controller. Fine by me, though if you want Kontrol Freaks make sure you get the Playstation ones.It’s wired only I believe. Not a problem for me.The rest of it: triggers, grip material, ergonomics, meets the high standards of the other modern advanced controllers as far as I’m concerned. It’s all excellent.All in all, what’s not to like? 5/5

",5.0,Jeff Higgiins,"Reviewed in the United States April 22, 2018","









  
  
    
  Simply put, Razer is the best controller and mice manufacturer in the world, period. I own the Wildcat controller and the Taipan mouse along with six other devices, the newest addition being the Wolverine. Craftsmanship: top tier with high grade aluminum parts, high quality buttons, and an excellent finish. It comes with a long 6ft braided cord and a nicely molded hardshell case (which I really like). Ergonomics: Perfection. Picking up any Razer product just feels right. Work goes into researching fit and comfort and you can tell. Customization: Six additional programmable buttons makes gaming a lot easier (I like remapping the thumbstick buttons so they don't wear out). There are a few CONS: mainly the price. You get what you pay for and if you want the best, you are going to pay a little more. There are many additions to this controller which raise the cost (extra buttons, extra thumbsticks, LED lighting). What sold it for me was the six additional buttons. If you wait a while, the price eventually will come down to 100-120 a much more attractive prospect. Also no wireless. This is a corded controller but I need all the response time I can get, so I don't mind.PROSCraftmanshipProgrammable buttonsErgonomicsCONSExpensiveCorded controller

  A great controller from razer. I owned the ultimate before and loved it.

It's a cool feature - but definitely takes some getting used-to.Only gripe I have with it is that the trigger lock SOMETIMES slips.

This is strictly a first impression review from a guy that is passionate about casual gaming, so I can't comment on longevity at this point and I'm by no means a pro or an e-athelete, I just wanted a nice gaming controller, and so far I think I've found it.The Razer Wolverine Ultimate comes in a nice package. Razer understands the importance of the wow factor not just from the device itself but also the box it comes in. That box is quality cardboard that opens easily to present the carrying case (with controller inside) front and center stylishly padded in a nice black foam cutout. In a black insert underneath is the braided black cord, and with the controller in the case are the different height thumbsticks and D-pad. These easily switchable sticks and D-pad are held onto the unit by magnets, and they still feel solidly attached despite being easy to switch without any kind of tools or disassembly. Despite it being only a hard wired game pad, the cable still can detach from the controller for easy storage and also has a breakaway towards the USB end, so a clumsy trip up shouldn't send your tower crashing off your desk. The end that plugs into the controller is nicely reinforced with a plastic bracket built into the unit so that the stress of any tugging on the cable doesn't directly fall on the micro usb plug, which seems like a thoughtful design choice. Underneath all of that in the box is a simple instruction manual and warranty card, and some other Razer promotional stuff, as well as a page with 2 razer stickers. I hardly ever use them, but I appreciate a company that helps me rock their logo on my equipment if I want. Minimalistic and no extra plastic bags. Points won from me.The buttons feel great and the sticks have a good level of resistance. Face buttons feel clicky like mouse buttons and only need a light press. There are rumble motors in the main unit and smaller ones in the main triggers. The unit is not wireless, but for me this is a plus. The controller feels well made and solid, even though it is still lightweight.Now, my main point of clarification for PC only users. First, the RGB will not synch with your other Razer chroma products on pc. I had read about this and was worried that it meant that I wouldn't be able to change the RBG coloring. However, you can download the Razer Wolverine for Xbox app onto windows and set up your color preferences and brightness levels there or turn the lights off completely. The app also lets you individually adjust the two types of rumble features I mentioned earlier, and lets you set up the 6 remappable bumpers and triggers on the back. It is important to note that these buttons can ONLY be mapped to any of the other buttons on the controller and not any keyboard buttons. Not a deal breaker for me, but it's something that needs to be clear for others. So, if you're playing with this only on PC, yes, using the Xbox app on your PC allows you to do anything you could do on Xbox with it on your PC, but that's it. Out of the box it is fully functional plug and play with the default control settings and a shifting rainbow pattern for the lights. For me all of this is fine.I hope this review can help other shoppers make a decision. It may not be the best for those looking for 100% fully customizable control on a competitive PC gaming level, but if you just happen to be a person who wants a really nice wired gaming controller then you have a great option here.

    Good quality weird/bad choices in design

  Controller is nice in some ways but the buttons are too hard to click in fast paced games. The extra 2 programmable buttons are in. A place that are unusable. The cable it comes with is micro usb instead of usb C . Has rubber grip which is nice, triggers are fine. Analog sticks are better than Microsoft’s but are a tad bit too stiff. Wired only, for the price I would say this controller isn’t worth it, unless on sale. Not awful just a lot of weird quirks that make the controller feel strange.

    Best Xbox Controller
  
",5.0,Mac W.,"Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2019","









  
  
    
  Features:Offers great competitive edge. Six extra individually programmable 4 buttons/2 triggers means you never have to press A B X Y. Therefore you never have to remove your thumbs from the joysticks, allowing you to reload/switch weapons/melee/jump/build all while still moving and aiming uninterrupted.Not to mention swappable joysticks of different lengths and curvature as well as a rocker d-pad and an individual buttons d-pad. Fully customizable chat and master volume of 10 levels each for headphones and earbuds using AUX only thanks to control dock imbedded into the bottom of the controller. Also has trigger locks allowing faster ADS/shooting speed. Comes with Razer Synapse app which allows you to customize the color of the bar at the top, how many colors, which way it moves, how it moves, etc. Synapse also allows you to bind the extra buttons (two top bumpers, two back buttons and two back triggers) to the original buttons (including joysticks) you already recognize. An extra feature of Synapse is that you can use ""Agile"" and ""Focus"" to let you rapidly increase and rapidly decrease the speed at which you aim. Agile and Focus are generally assigned to the back triggers.Elite or Wolverine:If you're trying to decide between the Elite and this, choose this. I have used both the Elite and the Wildcat extensively and this controller in comparison has put the extra buttons in the right place that feels natural to the hands. Lack of wireless mobility (a feature of the Xbox One Elite controller) is made up for by more buttons, more button profiles, more assignment options for those buttons, and real time audio mixing.

   Its a 5 star product but...I bought this about 6 months ago and I'm having an issue where it stops me from sprinting. With Apex Legends I use the setting AUTO SPRINT, so walking literally isn't an option but there's a malfunction where it just continuously stops sprinting and it begins walking. I have tried Nier Automata and same issue.I bought this contoller because a friend recommended it and he said the same exact issue happened with his.It makes the game unplayable.In the video I am sprinting the entire time, or at least trying to, when you see the gun pull up that's because my character starts walking.I recommend this controller, I just hope this issue doesn't continue across all their products.Other than this the controller is great. The extra button on top near the triggers/bumpers are perfect. I don't use the extra buttons in back tho, my fingers just don't work that way lol.I have since bought the V2 and I love the entire feeling of the controller. I'm still waiting for Razer to tell me what they can do for the issue.

  I've had both razer wolverines (which each broke after a year). They were great for shooting games, but no so much this one and here's why:On the original wolverine controllers you can map the focus aim key and continue shooting, or i also used to bind A button for rolling and dodging in division 2 (you have to take your thumb off the right analog stick to jump otherwise):Well  i only play Phantasy star online 2 and what I did with the 2 extra buttons was mapped them to left d-pad and right d-pad so i can scroll through my hotbar without taking my thumbs off the joystick.For this particular event, it is a marvelous controller. If you're looking for an advantage in shooting games, go with one of the other wolverines, but in my position this controller is amazing.

  I guess the controller itself is fine, but the integration with online software to change the RGB settings and bindings doesn't work or only works sometimes. If you don't want to change the RGB settings then its a great buy (ON SALE at least) otherwise their are better options out there. I love Razer a lot (Mouse, Keyboard, Mousepad, Headset) but this is their worst device in my opinion.

  I was on the fence with this purchase, having not been satisfied with my elite controller, but finally gave it a chance. The overall construction is very solid and it has a good feel, but I question the durability of the buttons over the years. You can't click them softly, you can only click them. Having said that, many reviewers say you get used to the clicking over time, but I never did. In fairness, I only played for about 4 days but the best way I can describe it, is it just doesn't feel like you're playing video game with those buttons. It's different for sure and I understood that going in. But the claim that you get increased responsiveness due to the cord and button click just wasn't true. That was a let down for me.Many reviewers mention this controller isn't completely customizable, and in fact they are correct. I wasn't sure how important this was to me, only being able to map their additional 6 m1-m6 buttons, but the downfall for me was in the deadzone of the thumbsticks. These aren't customizable at all, and there was a significant deadzone in each thumbstick that was noticeable in my main game Rocket league. Most games allow you to customize the deadzone in game, but that didn't seem to effect how responsive the thumbsticks were. My overall play and angles were less aggressive and responsive.And the cat in the bag, the cord. It's a solid cord, made extremely well. Again, going in, I liked the idea of having my inputs be more responsive and questioned whether or not a corded controller would be that big of a deal ergonomically. That was until literally 5 seconds after plugging it in and sitting down my 3 year old son tripped over the cable! Cable length was sufficient for my needs, around 10 feet, but if you have children, they will trip and disconnect it. Luckily they have the breakaway part of the cable but it's still a concern midgame.I was hoping this was the controller to fill in the gaps of my elite's drift, bumper and grip problem, but it didn't suit my needs as I hoped it would. Thank you Amazon for quick shipping and returns.

  So I have all the “big name” expensive controllers. I would say this ranks third on my list of controllers.The remap buttons are in awkward places.The D pad when you use the 4 axis one it’s fine, when you uses the multipad it’s useless and not responsive.There are only two settings for the trigger stops. The other thing, the xyab buttons are more like short press mouse buttons. There is really no tactile response. I can see how this is faster but it’s not as good for the way I play.The magnetic replaceable thumb sticks are good but nothing great. I added toppers because they are pretty short overall. You can store two profiles but you have to remember which is which. Sometimes it loses the profiles and you have to reload on the flyThe best part for me is the mic controls, 4 loudness controls and mute for the mic.It’s a good wired controller but there are others that are cheaper that feel and work much much better.

  The controller was nice enough while it lasted, not worth $130 though. Our controller lasted 4 months and Razer would not replace it. We provided proof of purchase from Amazon, but Razer would not replace / repair the controller because the sticker that has the serial number for the controller on it was peeled off.  Beware before you buy – that is the how the company that claims “for gamers by gamers” will treat you. We will never by a Razer product again.We replaced it with a PowerA Spectra Enhanced Illuminated Wired Controller – fraction of the cost and works just as well…A small update - here is Razer's response to me - beware, not a quality product -To further proceed, we would like to inform you that we have already reached out to our higher level of support and we will not be able to process with the replacement.As much as I wanted to break our rules and proceed with the replacement, my hands are tied up.

  This product delivered in all the ways it was designed for. However there were some little things about the controller that made it a uncomfortable experience for my personal preference. These things were the mouse-click buttons and the triggers. The reason why I had an issue with these two things is because I have used Xbox controllers for all of my gaming up to this point. So, when making the switch to very different buttons and triggers it was very uncomfortable. It felt very weird and I often didn’t even feel like I was pressing the buttons. Overall, if you want a controller that is BASED off an Xbox controller but has different characteristics while also performing well than this is the controller for you.

  I ended up getting and tested the controller as soon as it arrived. First impressions were that it looked and felt like a quality controller. For a wired controller I thought the $100 price range was a bit high but I figured I'd save some money because originally I was going to get an xbox elite controller. Tested and loved the buttons and thumbstick controls as well as the programable features (not many) but it was a nice add on. The problem I ran into was with one game in particular which was a side scrolling game and noticed that when the left controller stick would be moved all the way to the right or left the game character would keep on moving even when stick was back to center. This was with the default settings and I could not find a fix for it no matter what I tried. Tested with other games mainly fps games and the problem would not occur. In the end I did not want to ignore this issue and later on see the problem appear on other games, so I decided to return it. I did check the support page and couldn't find anything describing this particular issue and found no firmware updates for me to try. Hopefully in the future there is a patch for this because razer made a nice controller here. Maybe it was just my controller and other buyers aren't experiencing this but I wanted to put it on the review in case others are seeing this issue.

  This is 100% a waste of money if you want to use a gaming headset. It doesn't support the audio on xbox one that is normally under setting after hitting the home button. In the xbox setting and the app that comes with the controller there is no way to turn on mic MONITORING. I have to use my 20$ xbox controller to use my headset then game with the razer. This is my first day owning it and regret buying it. Take a look at the tournament razer that may be different. but this ultimate is 100000000% useless for any gamer using a headset. Will update on how it actually controls.Update . Few month or 2 . Controls nice sometimes the x button gets stuck but has come back after hitting it again only happen 4 times . And with the mic monitoring , if you have a headset with a battery and a mic monitoring volume button on the hetset itself it works. So that's what I do , this controller with a corded turtle beach head set that has a battery you change in the headset itself for more power than the controller can give to it.

  What I needed was a controller that had extra programable buttons. Between the Elite, Wolverine(Ultimate), and a Scuff controller, the Wolverine was the cheapest. The other two controllers were wireless, but since I primarily game at a desk with my console within a arm's reach, why pay for extra for it. The wolverine(Ultimate), like the others, has swappable thumb sticks and D-pad, a mute button, CHROMA, on-board volume control if you use the 3.5mm jack, and a lower price tag.

  I use this controller mainly for Call of Duty, and as I am playing the L3 will start stuttering and you will stop moving at the same time. It is very frustrating to deal with and makes the game unplayable.

  I REALLY LIKE this controller. As a left handed gamer, I'm used to having to use third party controllers and mice to game,  and since companies like Scuf and Razer have been making controllers with extra remappable buttons, I've been using them. In the past, I've used the Razer Sabertooth and Wildcat for PC gaming, and though both were better than the stock Xbox controller, neither was quite right for me.The Sabertooth and Wildcat both had the same problem for me - the extra triggers on the bottom protruded too far and were placed awkwardly for my hands, and the hard plastic grips eventually caused hand fatigue. (I'm a professional tattooist who games a lot when not working, so hand strain and fatigue are a constant issue for me. Basically, my hands never get a break, and after a week of work, holding a controller on my day off can be actively painful).So, this time out, they got everything right. The old removable triggers on the bottom of the controller have been replaced with textured buttons that rest exactly where my fingers lie, and the hand grips are rubberized, extremely comfortable, and feel slightly more ergonomic than before. The face buttons are a little tighter in the controller as well, and the slight rattling they used to produce on previous Razer controllers is gone.Long story short, this thing is a joy to use. I can use all four under-buttons without having to shift my hand awkwardly (a first for me on any controller, and I've used most or all of the ones Razer has made, The Microsoft Xbox Elite, and a few Scuf controllers). The sticks feel right, and the grips feel perfect. In fact, what prompted me to write this review is I've been sitting on my day off gaming, which normally means I start with sore hands from the day before, and can play until they get too cramped and I have to stop. I started out that way today, and just realized my hands feel better late in the day than they did this morning, which tells me I'm not straining them at all using this thing. That's never happened before.Also, the app you can download to PC is a nice touch. It's easy to use and lets you completely tweak the controller, down to the lighting and level of vibration you want. I'm used to the ""hold the Map button, then hold the bonus key while pressing the button you want to change the buttons"" thing that feels like you need 3 hands to do it, but having the ability to set the whole controller up while it sits on your lap is great.I can't rate this thing highly enough. Well done, guys. Now make one like this I can use on my PS4!

  I have owned a elite and infinity 1 scuf.  I bought this to play cod and have used it daily for a week. I would say for me this is best. The first reason is the button placement on the back (I did have to put a piece of masking tape for better grip on it). The scuf is too hard to press, although It does get looser. The elite I press by mistake to much, but has the fastest response.Next the bumpers on it respond noticeable faster. I don't notice any differ between all 3 controller on the triggers. I like the trigger stops built in something the elite doesn't have.The main reason I bought this is my elite joysticks were wore out. I've it about 1.5 years play with it almost daily. It is still a good choice.Other things to know. Like all new controller they joysticks has to we broken in. I started on a 10 sensitive and am now back down to my normal 5 after a week. My aim seems better, but time will tell.If you play with kontrol freeks the ps3/Xbox 360 work great.

    This quality controller feels great to use overall - READ PROS & CONS HERE!!!
  
",4.0,Mason Family,"Reviewed in the United States January 3, 2019","









  
  
    
  PROS...- This controller feels really great to play with.  I honestly really love it.  Way better than a standard $60 xbox controller.- I love the additional remappable 6 buttons (4 on back, and 2 on top).  The 2 on top are unique to this controller and placed in a great spot.  The 4 on the back take a little bit to get used to, but don't get actually pressed like the Xbox Elite controller (which I also like, by the way).- I love the ""focus"" option, which basically works as a temporary DPI adjustment that you can assign to any of the buttons.  This allows you to slow the movement down of one or both analog sticks adjusted to whatever speed feels great for you.  I assigned it to a rear button to slow down the right stick so I can be more precise with sniping (Mostly PubG for me, but works with any shooting game).- Another unique and great feature to this controller.  The LED lighting (although not at all necessary) is another cool unique feature.  You can assign the led options (colors and other options) to each saved controller configuration so you know which configuration you are currently using on the controller.- Controller feels slightly more ergonomic to me than the Elite, but I'm sure this depends on your hands and how you hold the controller.  I'm 6'5"" tall with large hands.- The Wolverine Ultimate is also way lighter than the Elite, which makes it easy and comfortable to use for long periods of time.- Right/Left quick fire trigger settings feel great (requires slightly less pressure pull than the Elite)CONS...- It's not wireless (as you probably already know), but the cable is premium quality, has a great solid connection to the controller that keeps it from being easily broken, unlike the xbox controllers (including the Elite).  This is the biggest issue most people have with this controller, but it's not a problem at all for me.  Plus, playing with a cable offers the quickest reaction time.  It's probably barely noticeable to most of us, but it may keep you alive on a few rare occasions.- Yeah the built in headset options are attached to the controller (unlike any of the Microsoft controllers), but this controller doesn't have a mic monitoring option.  This is the biggest con for me personally.  I'm used to being able to hear myself when I talk in chat which keeps me from feeling like I have to yell over people to be heard, and also I'll notice if I'm breathing into the mic or something rather than another person in the chat having to tell me to move my mic because they don't want to hear it.  Why oh why didn't you include this option Razer.  Many gamers complain about this issue online.  If you don't care about mic monitoring (you probably haven't had it before), then this may not be an issue for you.  The $10 extra for this controller over the Elite (currently $160 for Razer Wolverine Ultimate and $150 for Elite) is still cheaper if you need to purchase a separate headset adaptor for $30-$50.  (By the way, go with Turtle Beach if you do - I have 4 of them and the ""superhuman hearing"" option is amazing for hearing and locating enemy players near you.)  Unfortunately since the headset controls are built-in to the design of this controller, I can't use my TB headset adaptor with it.- Lastly, but won't usually be an issue, I had an issue with my 3.5mm headset adaptor on my controller upon opening new for Christmas.  The controller would shut off when I plugged in my headset (which worked totally fine with all of my other controllers).  I discovered that the extension cable I was using wasn't compatible with this controller, even though it worked totally fine with every other controller I did own, including the Elite.  So it you need to add an extension cable to to reach further than the cable that already comes with this controller (approx 10ft), I'm not sure if it'll work.SUMMARY: I really do like this controller, a lot.  I just wish it had a voice monitoring option, but other than that, it's amazing and feels great!!  Hope this helps my fellow gamers (or parents of) out there looking for a premium xbox controller.  :-)

    Ultimate: An upgrade over the original Elite. Tournament: Don't do it.
  
",4.0,CoonForLoon,"Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2018","









  
  
    
  Review note:I got almost a year worth of play from each Ultimate and Tournament purchases. I'm disappointed that I am forced to replace my controller yearly especially now that they can cost over $100. This is very bothersome as I use to game even more often and rarely had any controller break. This seemed to change starting with XBOX ONE and PS3. All my XBOX 360/PS2 & older Sega/Microsoft/Nintendo consoles have working controllers.I'm giving the Elite 2 a chance after giving Razor Ultimate & Tournament & MS Elite original their dire chances.2 year update:I bought the Tournament after the Ultimate crumbled after a year. I thought I would be able to save money by getting the Tournament as I didn't think I used the Ultimate features. However, I was so wrong. The Ultimate also has super upgraded face buttons that instantly react to light touches. The Tournament has a hard mash face button system. You have to press with more intent and the lag to do so will affect your twitch performance. For that alone, you need to skip the Tournament and get Ultimate. The Tournament crumbled on me after it's year. Instead of the left analog becoming loose, the stick itself split. 25%+ of the pad on the left side of the left analog cracked off. Sometimes my thumb falls off or I at least lose control. I've been suffering while I have been waiting for the Elite 2 to be released; they claim to have addressed durability issues.1 year update:All but the left stick of this controller held up. The left stick has a large dead zone now so precise control is gone. I think it started to loosen months ago but has now hit the point where I have to replace. Still better than the elite, but either way I think these things should last more than a year for a casual gamer. Less than 400 hours.Original:My XBOX Elite controller broke in 3 ways and going back to a standard controller was not fun. Finally came across this after searching. It was promising and it holds up to the hype.The buttons are more responsive than anything else I've ever known. The deadzone works as expected. I changed the LED to the Immersion mode; the default is silly, but that's why they let you customize. My hands get less fatigue than they did with the Elite.My precision in gameplay is extremely better now. I play a lot of Rocket League and noticeably winning a lot more. I make more of the hits I meant for while making less mistakes overall. I wish I had this controller when I played Sizz and Moses. They crushed me more than anyone has and I would have liked to have had a chance. Overall, my brain to game move translation has never been better.They only give you one long stick to swap out with. I wish you got two like you do with the Elite, but honestly since Rocket League only needs one precise stick, I'm doing fine. This is my only complaint, and no one is selling them separately.The XBOX app is easy to use, but I did not see a controller firmware update or check option. I guess that is only possible on PC?The focus and agile modes seem amazing for first person shooters. This will give a real edge to those who use it. This also helps with missing a second long stick.Disclaimer: I've only had this for 10 days now, so I cannot comment on long term durability yet. Even if it does break down, I'll probably buy another one of these and not switching back to Elite.

  I using the controller with windows 10 PC.  Integration was a snap, just plug it in and it works.  You need to download the RAZER CONTROLLER TOOL KIT from Microsoft to set up custom keys and use the chroma.  It would have been nice if It was recognized by RAZER SYNAPSE and didn't need the extra software but it is what it is.  The controller itself is accurate and feel great in the hand.  A lot of comments about the AYXB keys being clicky.  Its very subtle, to the point i thought at first I may have gotten a knock off because mine didn't seem to have the click but after a bit of use i could feel it.  If you press sown very gently the click is at the bottom of the buttons travel just before it bottoms out.  I like it and it adds to the feel of quality.

  The controller when in working order is amazing. However there are damaging issues. The Back grips started to peel off like the tape had become loose. The ""B"" button at one point became nonfunctional, i attempted to open it and just clean it however this would be a fruitless since they made it almost impossible to open the controller. The sticks are so easy to screw up for it to actually work like it should i had to super glue the sticks down otherwise whenever you do quick strikes to it, it would just fall off. My 60.00 regular xbox one controller has lasted me since i got my xbox in 2013 with none of these issues. So when paying 160.00 for a controller i expect it to last more then 7 months, Im considering taking business elsewhere since i want a fancy controller, but one that wont cause me heart breaking problems. I love this controller when its fresh and new its literally the best controller ever but after awhile it shows how cheaply its actually made.

    VS The Wildcat: In Some Areas an Upgrade, In Others a Downgrade
  
",3.0,pixelshaded,"Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2017","









  
  
    
  As far as ""pro"" controllers go, I have used an Xbox Elite Controller, Razer Wildcat, and now this Razer Wolverine. I bought the Wildcat when the right stick on my elite started to have the dreaded floating issue.I'm gonna be comparing this to the Wildcat since they have a lot of the same features and the Wolverine seems to be the next evolution.Upgrades- Dpad is waaaaay better- Interchangeable thumbsticks and dpad are nice- 2 extra triggers are nice, though I'm not sure how necessary they are since they can only replicate other buttons on the controller- chroma if you like lights- textured grip is applied at factory rather than at home with disassemblyDowngrades- Extra triggers on bottom are not mechanical anymore and are harder to press- Extra triggers changed position slightly and are less comfortable to use- If you prefer two short thumbsticks, they will have different tops because only one stick of each top type is provided in packageThe Wolverine certainly tried to win me over, but the change away from mechanical triggers on the bottom really killed it for me. I prefer the Wildcat.

    Great Controller With Excellent Build Quality
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States November 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have been regularly playing Xbox and PC games on a daily basis for years, and have been through half a dozen Microsoft Xbox controllers over the years through wear-and-tear - I do not throw, drop, or similarly treat my controllers, and yet I've had to deal with broken triggers, mushy buttons, loose battery compartments, joystick drift, etc. Given that the Xbox One controllers from Microsoft are a pain to pair with PC despite having Bluetooth, have terrible build quality and longevity, and still cost $60-80, I decided to give the Razer Wolverine Ultimate a try. I considered the Microsoft Elite Controller, but I've had many friends complain to me about joystick drift, rubber coating falling off, bad battery life, etc. with those controllers as well, which shifted me towards the Razer instead. After about a month of ownership, here are my takes on this controller versus those produced by Microsoft:PROS:- Build quality is incredible. I've had Razer peripherals before (I use a Razer Blade Advanced 15"" and a Blackwidow V2) and have always been impressed with the materials and build quality, and this controller is no exception. It comes with a good quality carrying case, a nice braided cable, it has a great textured coating and has some heft to it compared with the Xbox controllers. Yes, it's corded (which I prefer, because I don't have to deal with batteries/charging, disconnecting, loose battery compartments, etc), but the entire controller is very evidently made of high-quality plastic and metal components and just feels amazing.- Appearance: To my eyes, it looks fantastic. The Chroma lighting strip looks awesome and is customizable, and switches based on controller profile (more on that later), and the silver triggers and subtle Xbox button just look awesome. Look at the photos and form your own opinion, but I think in person it looks fantastic and surprisingly subtle and high-end.- Features: The highlights here include 6x remappable additional buttons (one by each set of triggers and bumpers, and two on each side on the back of the controller under the battery compartment). They all click well, are easy to find and reach naturally, and provide a TON of utility. It also has trigger locks, which shorten the trigger pull on the triggers significantly with a mechanical stop and are hugely helpful in shooter games. I use the two extra buttons by the bumpers and the trigger locks almost constantly for Elder Scrolls: Online, Rocket League, Warzone, and a whole host of other games, and I can already definitively say that I could never go without them now - they honestly have a MASSIVE impact on your gaming experience. There are also buttons on the controller for swapping profiles, mic muting, a re-map button, and a sound button that lets you adjust both master volume level and gamechat balance. The joysticks are also removable and can be swapped out for the included taller/convex joystick, or swapped easily with each other to reduce uneven wear. There are two different included D-pads which can be swapped - I love the one with 4 individual buttons vs the cross design and think it is loads better than the normal Xbox controller ""cross"" design. You can also adjust the vibrations motor intensity in 4 different regions on the controller, which is great for reducing or increasing the vibration sensitivity depending on the game you are playing.- Software: Synapse on Xbox works shockingly well and lets you remap the additional buttons to any other button on the controller (i.e. I have left on the d-pad assigned to the left side macro button, and right stick click mapped to the right side macro button), as well as ""agility"" and ""accuracy"" settings which reduce or increase the look/movement speed sensitivity when either held or toggled, which is a pretty cool feature. You can assign two different profiles to the controller itself, and can toggle between them using a button on the controller - these profiles each have their own RGB lighting settings, joystick sensitivities, macro button mapping, vibration levels in different areas of the controller, etc - a blue/green LED on the controller informs you of which profile you are currently using.CONS:- Wired: As I mentioned, this is a wired controller, which I actually prefer but obviously many people will see this as an inconvenience. The only upside is the nice long braided cable with a breakaway section in case someone trips on it or similarly pulls on it.- No adjustable joystick or trigger tension settings: The trigger locks are either on or off and shorten the stroke of the trigger pull, but don't actually have adjustable tension or stroke. The joysticks do not have any adjustable tension, but they do have adjustable sensitivities in the Synapse app.- Included Joysticks: This one doesn't annoy me because I love the default joysticks, but the controller only comes with one taller joystick and one convex joystick to swap out, rather than two of each.Overall Take: I personally love this controller! It's perfect for my needs, it's an order of magnitude better for more intense/hardcore gaming than a regular Xbox One controller with some excellent added functionality, and it has significantly better build quality. Given my experiences with previous Microsoft and Razer products, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this controller over either the Xbox One controller or the Xbox Elite controller - it's loads better than the base controller and (in my opinion) better designed and more reliable than the Elite Controller, which has a TERRIBLE online reputation for reliability and durability. If you are looking for a controller that is reliable, high-quality, and loaded with mechanical/software features, and can deal with the fact that the controller is corded, this is the controller for you.

  1. The analog sticks are shorter/wider than the standard Xbox controller. Why it matters: Shorter analog sticks mean less control, and wider (the top) analogs means you cannot use Kontrol Freeks with the controller.2. The back paddles are in a terrible position. Like truly awful. The feel/material quality of the controller is great. It would definitely be worth the cost...except the paddle location is plain bad. Yes, that is a matter of preference, but the paddles are just too low to ignore the drawbacks.If you like the paddle placement and don't use Kontrol Freeks, I would still suggest this controller though. Hopefully any newer models Razer makes reworks the back paddles, because the front paddles (bumpers) are great! I loved the front paddles during the 2 days before I decided to return it.

  I've gone through both elite controllers, and I bought this one hoping that it wouldn't have similar fundamental, build quality related issues. Unfortunately, this was not the case. Both of my bumpers are defective and often register single presses as double or triple clicks. For the games that I play, rb and lb are crucial and makes this controller unusable. Both this, the elite v1, and the v2 are unusable so no use for comparing their features because none of them can do the bare essential functions that a controller should do after just a month or two of use. I'm disappointed in this controller, and the entire market for ""elite"" or ""pro"" controllers because they charge 3x the price of a regular controller when its build quality is even worse than the $60 ones. ""Pro"" keyboards and mice are normally rock solid for a year plus, but controllers are so far behind. If anyone has any good options for 4 paddle controllers that do not break lmk bcz it appears that this controller is just like the rest in the build quality respect.

  I have an Elite controller, but when I saw the Razer, I had to try it. I use Razer products on my PC and I've always loved them, and it looked like this one might solve my problem with the Elite's paddles--apparently I can't quit triggering them accidentally. I ended up taking them all off and just adding one when I really needed it, but that felt like a waste.The Razer works well. The action feels a little bit better than the Elite to me, and the paddle design solved my problem--I never hit them by accident and get quite a bit of use out of them now. The software recognized the controller with no problem, and I have customized settings for nearly every game. The cord isn't super long, but it's more than long enough for my purposes since my setup is in a relatively small space. On the one hand, corded controllers are a bit of a bummer; on the other hand, I never have to replace or charge batteries.I purchased it eight months ago, and it still works perfectly after near-daily use (and a ton of weekend marathons). My only issue is that when I switch from the TV speakers to a headset, I have to shut off the controller and let it come back on before it will start routing the sound through the headphones. It's a tiny quibble and only takes maybe 20 seconds to reboot, but it is a bit annoying.

    Buy the Ultimate Edition! (better face buttons)
  
",5.0,Ryan,"Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this controller for use with my pc after having bought two xbox elite controllers that stopped working after mere hours of use and a battle beaver that was not working on arrival. I got both the ultimate and tournament versions because I had originally wanted to use the tournament, but I had heard from one or two reviews people that the buttons are different so I wanted to see for myself. I should mention, the first ultimate edition controller I received was broken on arrival, the shoulder buttons would basically not register at all when I held down the trigger on their respective sides, I have no idea what was causing it. I was able to get a replacement through the Amazon returns and they allowed it to cross-ship while I returned the defective controller at no cost to me. I would remove a star for this, but this controller is just so much better and cheaper than the rest of the competition at the moment that it doesn't even matter.Presumably a lot of reviewers have not tried both controllers so I am here to tell you definitively that there IS a huge difference in the face buttons. They are both nice and clicky tactile buttons, but the TE's buttons have a much much longer travel time. The travel is practically the same as a normal xbox controller, just with a nice tactile feel on actuation. It's not bad by any means, but compared to the buttons on the ultimate it's a night and day. The ultimate's buttons are lightning quick to actuate, you hardly even have to press them button down. They are absolutely amazing for competitive games. Razer really doesn't seem to give any information about this besides calling the TE's buttons ""tactile"" while the ultimate's are called ""mecha-tactile.""Also, the back buttons are really nice. I don't really have a use for a lot of them but I do really like being able to bind one of two things to back buttons which lets me avoid using a claw grip or awkwardly shifting my hands. It's never worth sacraficing your hands to game, invest in your health. Compared to the xbox elite controller's paddles which make the controller quite awkward to grip and are prone to accidental inputs, both wolverine controllers are much better, but as I said I highly recommend the ultimate verision. The ultimate's back buttons are actually perfect, I can grip the controller exactly how I would a normal xbox controller and then the buttons are right next to your fingers when you need them. I usuaully shift a finger onto the paddles for easier use too. Trying to place your fingers on all 4 buttons feels pretty awkward, but you might be able to get used to it.

  Absolutely loved this controller in my hands, the tactile feel of the button presses and everything before launching a game (Apex Legends) in which I use Advanced Look Controls. I turn off the dead zones so that I can be more accurate while having maximum sensitivity, mimicking that of a mouse and keyboard player. I went to the firing range to practice my aim with the new controller.  The aim stick drifted left considerably, enough to be noticeably unleveled with how fast I turn left versus right. I returned it and received a new one, thinking it was a flaw with that one product. Same thing on the second controller they sent me. I can’t be competitive with this controller, as I aim left far faster than when aiming right while using micro-movements.  Poor design for the aiming stick in my opinion. If you use dead zones and have to push the stick halfway to maximum in order to move your reticle, this might be perfect for you. Incredible feeling while using this controller, but the one thing I needed most (consistent and accurate aim) was nonexistent.

I would have kept it but Microsoft dropped the ball on how the USB connects to the control.  Razer hit it out of the park with this controller.  It is a wired controller but the cable can be removed.  But the way that the cable connects is where Microsoft failed.  The cable plug in is recessed into the controller adding stain relief the connector.  This way the connector is not feeling the strain of the cable.  Awesome.I am still getting to know the controller so i plan on updating my review later.IMPORTANT:  For the Wolverine series controllers the user manual is wrong when they tell you to download the ""Razer Synapse for Xbox""  You must download the ""Razer Wolverine for Xbox""  The ""Razer Synapse for Xbox"" will not work with the Wolverine.

  I have had horrible luck finding controllers that function properly. I started with a 2012 Scuf hybrid (best durability so far) but had connection issues. Switched to elite series 1, after 1st month it had horrible stick drift and even had dead points in the analog. Upgraded to elite series  2 developed exact same stick drift issues and would never be resolved for longer than a month.Clearly frustrated with Microsoft at this point, I decided to jump into another realm of controllers. This time from Razer. I've used alot of their products in the past and always thought it was decent quality but always loved how clean the rgb is. I picked up this Wolverine Ultimate, felt great straight out of the box, tight responsive etc. Then I tried using a quick chat on the D-pad and it selected an option in the exact opposite direction than I pressed. It's been about 4 months of owning it, i've dealt with the d-pad issue the entire time still trying to find my warranty. The ""clickiness"" of the buttons is like a mouse, which is interesting at first but definitely wears fast. 4 months and you can barely hear or feel the A button click.I don't know if it's just horrible luck, bad programming, lazy manufacturing or whatever. I'm just sick of spending $110+ on products that don't even last a quarter of the life span of the xbox 360s lolIt's also very weird transitioning from elite to this, it takes a few days. Try it out, if it works for you it's a solid controller. Just wish it would perform, i'm definitely not confident in its durability.

I paid ~$170 for each about a years length away from each other. Both having the same recurring issue the bumpers. The wear and tear I had with them was a joke, I could go into detail about them but that’s that. Razer got me into the game and I was a little hesitant to buy this, but I took a gamble. It was fantastic in everything all around the board this is better than the elites I’ve owned for nearly everything. The one big part for me was the adapter that comes with this is permanently on the controller and it didn’t go bad but very once in a while my voice would cut out. Not an issue if you have no one to talk to or don’t play regularly with people. Although for someone who is paying ~$140 for a controller I’m a bit of a serious “gamer” per say. This appeared to be an issue within the first 3 months of owning it. The wear and tear I put controllers though is bad but this one was fantastic till this happened. This is an amazing product it really is and it probably  won’t happen to anyone else and if it does then I hope Razer sees this and fixes it. I gave this a 3 star to hopefully get some attention to the people who criticize products and want a deep dive into a product, but also a customers opinion on how to improve. Razer did good on this controller they really, I've now went back to using my elite controller for now but it feels obsolete compared to the Razer if I’m being honest. If you found this useful please do whatever you can so people can see this and understand the product. Thank you(This is coming from someone who during the COVID-19 stuff played video games 8+ hours a day for around 5 months so keep in mind I am a gamer)

  So far the best controller i have ever had, i have only had it a month so as long as it holds up i'll never have to look for any other controllerUPDATE: Was a great controller but after 4-6 months i was getting drift and a couple of buttons were failing. Since i am easy on my controllers and don't play everyday i feel for the money this should last a lot longer then it did. If they drop the price to sub 100bucks i'll consider buying again but until then a bit of a ripoff

  I normally only stick to Console manufacturer made controllers, but decided to try this one.  The over all build quality and feel of this controller is definitely better than what im used to.  It quickly became my favorite controller.  I do however have a few issues with it.1. The bumpers on the top I kinda feel are a bit long and a little to easy to hit accidentally, it can really mess up your gameplay if you have an important button assigned to it.  Something I just had to learn to get used to, so not a big deal.2.  After a few months, it has a slight pull to the right on the left analog, contacting Razer was easy and quick, had to do a few tedious things for the RMA process, but the shipping and speed of everything was very quick.  I'm gonna assume I just got a lemon, and will test out the new one to see.Though even with the RMA process I feel like it's one if the best controllers I have bought in a long long time.  Would recommend it as of now, depending on if I have to RMA again.

This controller makes playing NBA 2K actually enjoyable because by default it feels like 2K is supposed to have a massive amount of input lag. Overall I am impressed it’s worth the money.

  I've had 2 Elite controllers that both developed stick drift just a few months after purchase, and the positioning of the paddles just didn't work for me.  I never could adjust to the play using the paddles.The Razer Wolverine is AMAZING in comparison.  It feels like a quality remote, and I got the hang of the paddle use in less than a week.  The premapped buttons were perfect for the games I play.  I also like the wired vs. a wireless remote now.  No more charging or running out of batteries... no more running around the house digging in tv remotes lolI could never go back as my movement and gameplay is way better now.I might even order another as a backup.

  My journey with this controller started a few days ago when it first arrived, everything seemed perfectly fine up until the left trigger just decided it should not work, so I ordered a replacement and now that I actually got to test it with ""everything"" working properly I can tell you without a doubt the old wolverine is heaps better, I still have my old one and its much much better. My main dislike for this controller is where they put those lines that separate the textured bit of the controller and the normal bit, the normal xbox controller does this right where your hand will never rest so you don't feel that annoying line but this controller put that line separation right where my hand rests so its very uncomfortable to hold, and not to mention theres no back paddles and the cable is not detachable. Really a massive let down Razer

  This thing is beyond sweet! I'm so glad that I bought it over the Elite controller. The mechanical buttons alone have made it worth the cost! I play Minecraft on PC as well as a ton of other games and they all see the controller auto-magically with no issues. I always play wired because I think it's a better experience so I don't mind that the controller is wired but some people don't like that. I prefer it actually and I won't even touch a wireless controller so this option was ideal for me in many ways. I've owned the controller for months now and it has improved the quality of all my gaming so much and I'm very happy. The way that the buttons click down and then click themselves back up is very awesome and it makes me able to do a lot of complex controller movements really quickly.

  This is by far the best razer controller in terms of design. Very fast response rate and buttons/triggers are great quality. The only issue is that I ordered one and it had left analog drift. If you are a competitive player this is a common issue that comes with the territory of using a controller. A quick return then trying again was worth it for me as now I have a perfect one. I've gone through two scuffs, and two razer raijus and neither of them are built as well as the wolverine ultimate. I'd like to see razer continue to focus on their controllers and become the staple in competitive gaming. No other controller has 6 remappable buttons and offers sensitivity increase and decrease buttons. I use mine on pc but it can also be used on xbox exclusively.  If you play fortnite you will absolutely dominate lobbies without question.

The ABXY buttons feel amazing and very little throw.  Feels very much like a mouse click.  Triggers feel great and the trigger pull adjustment is perfect.  Much better than the allen wrench style of the Scuf.  D-pad is a little wobbly and slightly unresponsive.  The backside buttons will take some getting used to as they are stacked on top of each other and there is a learning curve to them.Joysticks: 4.5/5.

    Great controller - Terrible Cord
  
",3.0,Mister Raccoon,"Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  For reference, I bought the thing to play with my laptop. As far as the controller goes I have zero complaints. The trigger-stops do what they're supposed to, making the Left and Right Triggers feel snappy and giving me more immediate feedback when playing Destiny or other FPS. There's a bunch of additional buttons on it I probably won't use too much but having the option is nice. To set the buttons and lights for PC users requires the use of the ""Razer Wolverine for Xbox"" app you can get for free on the MS store and which works well enough on PC.My gripe is the cord. The thing can't be used wireless. Which is fine. Direct input is usually better anyway. But if you're playing on a laptop the cord is **ridiculously** long. There's like 3-4 feet of this thing just dangling off the side of my laptop. So if you're playing on your Xbox and want a nice lengthy cable, this is fine. And it's pretty finicky to boot. Within 3 weeks of purchase I got the dreaded USB error that says ""failed to retrieve device descriptor"" or some such.  I know this is related to the cord because no matter what controller I plug it into (more on this in a sec) it simply won't identify properly. Amazon sells replacement cables, not made by Razor, that are a bit shorter for about $15 and change plus tax. If you're playing on a laptop this additional cable is a MUST buy.Another weird quirk about the controller is that, while it's cord can plug into any micro-usb device, such as a PS4 controller, not every micro-usb cable can be used for the Wolverine itself. The way the port on the controller is recessed and grooved means only certain cords can be used on it unless you want to risk damaging your controller port to make it play nicely with other standard fare cables.

    Great controller with a few minor flaws
  
",4.0,N. Warren,"Reviewed in the United States December 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  I’m a casual gamer that wanted to be able to keep up with friends that like playing Warzone. The extra buttons took a bit to get used to and for the most part I only use 4 of the extra buttons, three of the back buttons and one of the top buttons. The buttons and thumb sticks all feel great and I especially like the way they made the d-pad buttons. The button on the back that reduces sensitivity is a godsend for me when I’m trying to be precise like when sniping at range. The trigger locks are also nice although honestly I engaged them and never changed it back and probably never will. The chat buttons and headset port are really nice and make it quick and easy to adjust in game volume or chat volume. Occasionally I get a weird crackling from my headset when it’s plugged in which seems to originate from the controller, but usually disconnecting the controller and plugging it back in fixes it.The reasons I don’t give this 5 stars is that first the buttons on the back of the controller aren’t the most accessible. I’ve got pretty big hands and the buttons are in the middle of the back of the controller which isn’t as comfortable as say an Xbox elite controller where the arms are situated under the grips. The second issue is that I have to set a higher deadband on the thumb stick to keep it from drifting than I have to on my basic Xbox controller. This hasn’t been an issue that I’ve really noticed other than having to change the setting, but it surprises me that the cheaper controller has a tighter tolerance. The sounds crackling issue that I noted above is a pretty minor inconvenience and has never lasted through a reset. Lastly it’s not a wireless controller which again is a small gripe, but given the proximity in cost (unless it’s on sale) to an elite controller makes it a tough sell if you don’t sit close to where your console or PC is located.Overall I’m really happy with my purchase and since I got it on sale it was a much better value than the retail price.

  Let me start by saying I loved this controller until it broke and their customer service has been bad thus far.  The fact that it plugs in is a huge plus.  Not having to worry about changing out rechargable batteries is a huge plus.  The lights on it are cool and the chat pad at the bottom is awesome.  This controller crapped out on me after 3 months though.  the right and left bumpers no longer work.  Let me explain sometimes when I press them it recognizes one click sometimes it will not recognize at all and sometimes it will recognize 2 or 3 clicks.  This makes a game like Fortnite unbearable when you are in battle and you think you are swtiching to your shotgun but it registers 3 clicks and switches you to bandaids instead.  I called customer support.  The guy was nice but had no clue what he was doing.  He was looking for drivers then wanted me to download the Razer app, which is only usefull for setting custom mappings and changing the light schemes. He asked if I bought the controller from Amazer sold by Amazon, hoping that would be his way of weaseling out of helping me. I told him it was.  He opened a ticket and emailed me a form to fill out along with attachment my invoice for the purchase. I did and 3 days later I have heard nothing.  I will adjust my review if they remedy it.  Having a 30 day warranty on a $160 controller which went bad in 3 months is not good.  I would stay clear of this controller.

It was fine a few days ago and now refuses to work. I have not dropped my controller or done anything to damage it and no one else in the house even goes near my pc.

  Their synapse software does not work on Win 10 unless you use a compatible Razer keyboard and mouse. This is stated nowhere and I only found out after being on with support for 30 mins. A miserable and unacceptable requirement. Do not buy if you are using only with Win 10.

  Pros - Responsive tactile buttons, button mapping software,  solid rubber grips and thumb sticks that  feels great.Cons - bigger then the xbox one s controller, 1.5 times bigger easily.  bottom buttons are mounted way too high I've owned a power controller A controller a pdp controller and an elite controller this one has buttons mounted  higher then all three and cant be customized.  last thing i noticed is that while the face buttons are clicky and tactile they are rather hard to press. this is for good for fighters but harder to deal with on fps games. though to be fair they do add two remap-able buttons near the triggers that you can swap for any face button.All in all its a good buy if you want elite controller features for half the price and enjoy large controllers. if you want something similar to the xbox one s controller in size id say save up and buy the controller 2.

  I am not by any means a professional gamer, but here are my thoughts-Wired-Working XBox button-Responsive-Multi-function buttons (can be turned off)-Customizable-Durable-Break away nylon cable (9'10"" long)-Rubber cable wrap-Rubber gripsI have been experiencing some lag with my stock controller, so I specifically set out to find a WIRED controller that is very RESPONSIVE. I am not disappointed. The buttons are crisp and quick with an audible *click* with each button press. I like that.The fact that the XBox button works is great. It doesn't even need to be held down to turn on the XBox, just a quick click and the console responds. Neat!Right out of the box this controller is pretty cool. It feels a lot like a stock controller, but the MULTI-FUNCTION BUTTONS are definitely different. I have never had a controller with these buttons, so it will take some getting used to, but I can tell I'm really going to like this feature. If ever I do change my mind, I can assign them to do nothing when pressed, completely eliminating them without the need to remove them (before you ask, they are not removable). The light in the center is CUSTOMIZABLE as well with different color options as well as different patterns and brightness. It can even be turned off altogether if one chose to do so.The controller looks and feels DURABLE in my hands. I'm not worried about dropping it on the floor. I am clumsy by nature and have 2 curious and sometimes rambunctious cats.The nylon branded CABLE is clearly durable as well. I have had products in the past with similar material so I am confident this cable will last a very long time. This cable also has a very nice BREAK AWAY feature which is really great for storage and for having 2 cats that can be unruly with their brotherly wrestling matches. With this feature I don't fear them ripping the cables from the XBox console, nor am I worried that they could pull they XBox from the T.V. stand altogether. And if ever my fiancé or I tripped over it, I think the cable and controller would survive quite nicely. However, I don't think it will be easily uncoupled by accident as when plugging the wire into the console, the controller, and attaching the cable in the middle (see photos) it feels solid and tight. And the rubber CABLE WRAP is adjustable, which provides storage options; I can choose to wind the cable tight and small, thin and lengthy, or anything in between; this cable wrap will do well in any scenario.The RUBBER GRIPS on the joysticks as well as the backs of the hand grips feel very nice. With my stock controller, I did have issues with long-term gaming and felt my controller slip out of my grip. I often had to readjust the controller in my hands. This controller is definitely better for that, my fingers grip it nicely.After downloading the Razer Wolverine for XBox app I discovered that it is even more CUSTOMIZABLE than I realized. The MULTI-FUNCTION BUTTONS can be remapped to basically anything and even the range of the joysticks and triggers can be changed as well as vibration intensity. Very nice features for anyone wanting tailored responsiveness.All in all this is a great controller and I am very excited to get to know all of its features and functionality in the enjoyment to come. Well done, Razer, as always you have delivered a quality product.

  I bought this controller in hopes that it would surpass all other controllers I have used in the past.  For the first few months the controller worked great.  I play roughly 10 hours a video games a week on average.  However in the last month I noticed some significant changes.  One being that the (L) joy stick is moving to the left always in games.  Ex)  Character spawns and moves to the left until you hit the joy stick to the right to cancel it out.  Secondly, and most importantly, the cable.  After several months of being extremely cautious and careful with this controller/cable, it now does not work.  It slowly was disconnecting randomly at times, now there is no connection at all.  I do not throw my stuff around, I have not dropped it, I took incredible care of it.  I will not be purchasing this again, nor will I recommend it.  I am very disappointed I spent 160.00 on a controller that worked for less than a year.  My xbox controller is 4 years old and still going strong.

    PLEASE READ  Broke Within One Day of Rocket League
  
",1.0,Nathan Davis,"Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2019","









  
  
    
  I used this product for 5 hours in trainers in Rocket League.  By mapping left and right air roll to the back buttons, it's possible to tornado flick.  After spending 5 hours learning that as well as getting COMPLETELY REPROGRAMMED in my brain to use the back buttons to air roll left and right, the boost button (B) randomly COMPLETELY stopped working in the middle of a game.  Just straight up did not allow me to boost.  I took it into training and found that indeed, the button would randomly not register.  This has been mentioned in multiple other 1 star reviews.Furthermore, the right trigger was sticky at the beginning and by the end of 5 hours of playing was ALREADY squeaking.FURTHERMORE, I spent an hour and a half and had to contact Razor support to get the ""plug-and-play"" thing to work with Steam games.  HINT:  You have to turn OFF XBox controller configuration support for SOME reason.SO, after 1.5 hours of suffering through getting it to work and 5 hours of actually using and getting excited at my new prospects in the game :D , it has a button stop functioning consistently and a trigger going from sticky to squeaky >:(((( .  I absolutely am not satisfied, nor would I recommend this controller to anyone.  At least anyone that SERIOUSLY games or needs CONSISTENT precision in their inputs.  Definitely NOT for competitive games like Rocket League (unless you're like a silver lol).It baffles me that a product advertised as plug-and-play that costs $120 would be SO much headache and disappointment in a single day.  I copped out and bought this because SCUF has been out of stock for over 4 weeks with ""No known ETA on when we'll be restocking our XBox controllers"" (coming straight from their support which I contacted).  I guess learn from my mistake and wait for SCUF to restock (some unknown ETA), because there is a an honestly decently high chance you might get one of these controllers that becomes completely unusable in 1-7 days' time.  This is something that is marketed to serious gamers with precision needs, and it absolutely does not stand up to that test.  Couple that with the consistent theme of this (and very similar problems with the back buttons) mentioned in other 1 star reviews, and you come to realize that there is something likely low quality in the manufacturing process.  Another review mentioned he got a replacement only to have the same thing happen again.  That's why I'm refunding without giving them another chance.  If you can't have a product that withstands even a single work day of gaming, then you do not deserve $120 of my money.

  I've gotta say, this is a really good controller. I have had this thing for about 2 months and it feels really nice to hold. The mouse clicks are satisfying to press compared to a regular controller and the magnetic trigger stops feel great to fiddle with, but it has a few setbacks for some people. the first one being for the fellas who use a ""claw grip"" the start button will be near your index knuckle, so you will hit it more than you would think. second is the bumpers and the triggers. The triggers are fairly blocked by the bumpers if you use them simultaneously. Also you need the razer xbox app to map the other two bumpers for the pc fellas.tldr: looks good, feels good, sounds good, very strudy, but the bumpers and triggers collide with each other and the start button is easy to misclick if you have a claw grip. cant button map the extra 2 buttons on pc to my knowledge.

  Much more convenient to hold than the Elite. The paddles are not in the most ""natural"" position but I found that they are better in their position on the Wolverine because I can hold the controller and click the buttons on demand. With the Elite I have to hold the controller ON the paddles, which led to inadvertent paddle clicks.Of course this one is wired so if that is a deal breaker then look elsewhere.

  Pretty good,  but wouldn’t pay full price for it.my hands are a bit on the smaller size, so I find the design to fit my hand great. The led lights are a plus. I honestly don’t mind the usb cable since I’m originally a pc player(everything is wired and for optimal gaming I’d debatably say wireless is not good for latency concerns) I like that the controller is also pretty light, everything is built pretty well, but it is my first time using a controller with multiple button mappings, so it’s going to feel and still is awkward for me to utiliZe. But the more different games I play and mess with the button maps, I can definitely feel it helps a lot. (Overwatch for certain characters like doomfist it’s great. Call of duty it’s pretty damn good esp if you like to knife)It has a mechanical click noise! Huge plus for me 😭 coming from using mechanical keyboards and mouse the noise and feel when I play feels so great, and debatably it helps the controls run smoother and better.They have trigger adjustments, and for me personally, man it helps a lot. Helps boost my reflexes and reaction time.My only downside is are the analog sticks,They only come with 2 different sets, and unfortunately kontrol freak does not fit on them. I purchased a ps4 one and had to damage the sticks a bit to fit them.I personally only liked one of them because it was longer and helped with my aiming but it was the only longer one they had. The rest were standard size.Overall controller is great, if you like mechanical keyboard and mouse you’ll definitely like this, and I got it during prime day, but I wouldn’t have paid more for it.It does improve your gaming experience, but not significantly life changing honestly.

    WARNING: cannot find replacement thumbsticks anywhere (not even from Razer!)
  
",2.0,Sage O,"Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this rather pricey wired controller because I was tired of OEM Xbox One controllers dying or falling apart at $50-$70 each. I had already purchased four that died in addition to the one that came with my console that also died -- that's $250 or more in replacement costs! (Worth noting, my 360 console that I keep for Beatles Rock Band and whatnot still has its original controllers.) Infuriated with Microsoft's subpar Xbox One controllers, I switched to the Razer Wolverine Ultimate, looking forward to no longer worrying about batteries or charging, as well as interchangeable sticks, hoping that shorter sticks would be easier on my often painful gamer thumbs.The controller is impressive in looks, comfort, and features. Even the wire is mesh covered and detachable, and unless you have kids or pets, it's really no big deal and saves A LOT of hassle over swapping batteries at inopportune times.The shortest thumb-sticks did indeed soothe my overused thumbs. That is, until one of them fell off, nowhere to be found. I called Razer and was told they hadn't any replacements in stock. WTF. Checked back three times in as many months and not a single time did they offer stick replacements! Searched eBay, Amazon and more.NO ONE HAS of REPLACEMENT STICKS for the Wolverine Ultimate, except Razer, who doesn't regularly keep them in stock.Had I known that going in, I'm unsure that I would have purchased it, and I'm pretty salty over the whole affair, because magnetic parts come off more easily than you might imagine, and what sort of company makes proprietary hardware with interchangeable [easily lost] parts then doesn't stock them?!-2 stars for not regularly having replacement sticks in stock. -1 star for not allowing resellers to stock replacement parts as well. What good is a controller with magnetic parts if those parts become lost or damaged and you cannot purchase replacements?!

    Better than Elite Controller, BY FAR.
  
",5.0,MJT,"Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2018","









  
  
    
  I have owned a SCUF One, the Microsoft Elite Contoller, and now the Razer Wolverine Ultimate and I can honestly say this has become my favorite controller.I cannot speak bad about the SCUF other than the fact my paddles kept breaking and I had to replace them often.  It wasn’t major, but it was annoying.  Even still, the SCUF ranks better than the Elite being that I had it for over 2 years with HEAVY use (Destiny, Halo 5) and the only issue was the paddles breaking over time.The reason I upgraded to the Elite is because I wanted to move from 2 paddles to 4.  The Elite fit the bill, and I did not have to wait for my controller to be made, I was able to hit a local GameStop and pick one up that day.Initially I was excited, but I’ve had pretty much every known problem with my Elite.  My left bumper broke (search for elite bumper repair kit—-its so common that multiple sellers have repair kits for the bumpers!), my sticks became very loose (inexcusable considering I had the SCUF more than twice as long and never experienced that issue), and the grip panels on the controller began to peel—so annoying that I finally just removed them altogether. I bought the controller in april of 2017 and while it was still usable when I purchased the Razer in Jan ‘18, I would NOT say the quality was at all worth the price tag.  The SCUF FAR surpassed the Elite in this category.Now for the Wolverine Ultimate.So far I can tell you that this is my favorite controller.  I can’t speak for the durability or quality over time yet, but the controller FEELS like it’s actually going to last.  I will update my review at different intervals and update on this.The buttons are super responsive (light touches to the ABXY buttons will active them), and they feel more like a mouse click than the squishy feeling you get from the regular Xbox controllers (Elite and even SCUF included being that it uses the body of a regular one controller)The hair triggers work as well or better than the offering on the Elite, and I do prefer them over the Hair Trigger Lock system my SCUF One used.  I’m not sure if Scuf has made improvements in this area with their newer controller (Infinity?) but even the Elite controller was preferable to what was on my Scuf.  The Wolverine pretty much exactly the way the Elite does, and it does decrease the trigger travel a great deal.NOTE: I did NOT have issues with the hair triggers being a problem like I did with my Scuf and even elite (I had to calibrate the triggers being in hair trigger mode using the software on Xbox).  So far I have played PUBG and Halo 5.  Some games need the trigger to travel more than some hair trigger systems allow to register (thus it needing to be calibrated for the Elite—no option for this on the SCUF OR Wolverine).  Once again, though, I have had no issue with the Wolverine not registering on a game yet.The top paddles I thought would be an adjustment—but other than retraining my brain, they are very easy and “natural” to use.  The bottom 4 are excellently placed and are quite easy to access using your middle and ring ringers, eliminating the need for your fingers to ever leave the sticks.  I have opted to use the default buttton mapping (X and Y On left and right top paddles, A and B on the first 2 of 4 bottom paddles, and the using the bottom left paddle for FOCUS And the bottom right for AGILE).I’m not going to explain to you what FOCUS and AGILE do because that’s available to you elsewhere, just know that once you get used to the controller and the idea of having it—it is a game changer!  More precision or speed as you need it at your fingertips?  Yes please.If you’re alrwady considering this controller this should be a sign that you should give it a try.I decided to because I used a Razer copperhead Mouse when I PC gamed back when dinosaurs still roamed the earth (Quake 2), and was always very happy with it.  I’m glad I decided to try the Wolverine, it has not disappointed yet.Edit—August 25th 2020—I am STILL using the controller.  One paddle has stopped working, but it’s a minor inconvenience.  I’m still incredibly happy with my purchase nearly 3 years later!

  I'll start with what I really liked. The D-pad, while not mechanical, still felt a little clicky. Definitely not a standard membrane feel which was nice. Now the bad was the face buttons. It's possible I had a dud, but my face buttons did not feel like I expected. There was a lot of resistance before it would finally ""click"". Imagine a membrane key on top of a mechanical one. It was really disappointing after using the Razer Wildcat and loving the controller so much. On top of that the placement of the extra buttons on the grip didn't work well for me. Just from clenching my hands a little too much I would activate them really easily.On the plus side I got the Ultimate edition after this one and it is exactly what I was looking for. If you loved the Wildcat I'd recommend the Ultimate over the tournament edition. I caught it on sale for $130 and I'm very happy with it.

  i ordered a used one when i bought this and instead they charged me for a new one and gave me a new one. I don't care though because this is exactly the controller i was looking for. The colored LEDs are more than just a nice little show off you can do when your friends are over. They actually can serve as profile identification for custom button schemes you set with the games you want to utilize the 4 extra buttons for. Once you download the free app for the controller you will assign a profile. Lets say Gears of war 5 for example, then you can customize your button inputs. Then you can assign a LED color profile for when you use the Gears setup, very neat feature. The Cord for the controller is very long so do not worry it will not reach your chair, couch etc. Definitely worth the price.

    Unsupported by razer, broken apps from Microsoft, can't rebind extra buttons

  Product is not supported anymore. There are some apps on the windows store for win10 but they're broken. You can't change it remap buttons, and the extra buttons you have are just alternate buttons for A B Y X. You can't change these. The extra buttons are completely useless on this controller. Not worth the money at all. I'm switching to an elite, which is still supported by Ms and there's a software that let's you really bind keys to what you want for max customization.

    Poor joystick design
  
",3.0,Richard Rago,"Reviewed in the United States October 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  The product is built well and has a good feel to it. The buttons are nice as well but there is a major design flaw with this controller, the joysticks specifically. The joystick stem is fatter than a standard xbox one controller which ends up limiting the travel in the joystick. Specifically, the joysticks have 9% less travel than the standard xbox one controller which doesn’t sound like a lot, but is very noticeable in first person shooters and racing games. Adjusting the sensitivity doesn’t help because the controller takes the physical control out of your hand. The more travel in a joystick, the more control and accuracy you will get with your thumb. Because of this, I can’t recommend this controller.

  This item is comprable to the Xbox One Elite controller.  I've owned this controller for a good while now and there is no drift in my sticks and the buttons are still responsive and useful.  I like the back paddles on the elite controller better but you will get used to these over time.  This is not for people who want a wireless controller as this controller must be wired or plugged in but the cord is very long and it does not bother me. When it is time to get a new Xbox One controller, this is most likely the one that I will purchase.  Currently I am mostly playing Red Dead Redemption 2 and Call of Duty Black Ops 4.

   First of all, the box arrived damaged (idk if it was because of the delivery or the product was already like that when they send it); the controller itself has one of the trigger-stop switches loose which although it doesn’t affect functionality it’s kind of a downer that it came like that being this a “new” product, the controller itself has a premium feel once in your hands, I really liked the customization you can do to it, only downer it’s the plastic material from the extra buttons, triggers and bumpers, it’s really glossy and really easily scratched, overall it’s a good budget elite controller with the pros and cons of a wired controller.

  At first, I thought I bought the ultimate controller (aside that it's not wireless) in April 2019, the  for use on PC.The build quality seemed good, buttons crisp, grip is grippy and still not sticky.At this point I would have given it a 3.It's not a 5 because: Buttons can only be remapped to existing controller buttons. You would assume that the ""the most versatile and customizable controller ever."" would be able to do that, especially when you need ANOTHER program aside from Synapse and Razer Central, ""Razer Synapse for Xbox,"" to access all of its features. There, it even has a feature to change the controller sensitivity (or something) called Focus or Agile, which must be binded to a button to be used.Yes, it has original functions that are binded to buttons but can't it bind keyboard or mouse inputs. Note that because it has unique programming, other remap software that would work on normal Xbox controllers cannot be used with this controller. The Wolverine Ultimate was originally released in November 2017 -- any hope that they will provide an update for remapping is slim to none.Also, the ""lightweight braided fiber cable"" have these dense nubs 4 inches from where the cable ends, one the controller and two on the USB side (one actually an adapter), which are heavy enough to pull down on the cable and gets pretty annoying, especially when it hits my table or knee when I move the controller.I was pretty disappointed at this point but decided to keep it since I like the feel of it.After two months:DEFECT 1: The M2 button (the additional button near the bumpers) occasionally acts as if the button is continued to be pressed on. The physical button doesn't get stuck, so I had to press it again to reset it. As someone was enjoying the M1, M2 as quicker, more tactile buttons to replace the triggers, and needs to press it a lot, this was extremely annoying.After four months (now):DEFECT 2: I have heavy stick drift on both thumbsticks, and my X A B Y keys either do not send input or get stuck. Unlike the other defect, this happens regularly and I can't live with it being my main inputs.Unfortunately I decided to take the controller apart to see if was caused by debris, so I assume that my warranty is void.Overall, if this controller worked and was wireless, with keyboard/mouse inputs remappable to the buttons, then it's definitely worth the price.However, I would say this controller is actually worth $50 at most, but if I already have a controller from a current-gen console, I would not spend that $50 to get this or any controller with additional buttons. (You probably won't use the additional buttons, the ones on the back, since they are extremely awkward and you need to retrain muscle memory from scratch to use your index and middle fingers that you never used before.)tl;drThe Wolverine is a wired Xbox controller that feels nice, buttons and grip, but fail horribly at all the bells and whistles that are supposed to justify the very high price, especially in 2020.

  This controller is trash. I didn't even use it more than 3 times. Total. Right out of the box I noticed a little bit of stick drift. Thought maybe it was my call of duty settings.

Wednesday didn’t even attempt due to the amount of drift overnight??

  This controller is very comfortable when gripped how you would normally grip a controller, however..  The paddle placement on the bottom basically require you to play with open hands because they are so hard to reach and next to impossible while actually gripping the controller.When the whole point of a controller like this is for the paddles, and you make said paddles impossible to comfortably reach even with the very tip of your fingers you would be better off using a standard xbox controller.

  This is my 4th Razer controller after the last 3 I owned have severely degraded due to normal usage. I've had a Sabertooth and 2 Wildcats and this one is a step down from those older models. The ABXY buttons are stiffer and require more force to push them down. This is critical for me since I play Rocket League and I often need to press the A & B button at the same time. The multi-function triggers on the back are in a weird place and my ring fingers sit on the edge of the hard plastic piece which is unpleasant. This could have been avoided if they just rounded off the edge or moved them up higher. Unlike previous models, Razer opted to remove the ability to set macro buttons using just the controller and forces the user to use the Razer synapse application. In hindsight I should bought the Ultimate edition, but couldn't justify spending $150 when all 3 of my controllers have broke in some way.

  I had high hopes for this controller but ultimately it has been a horrible decision purchasing it. I purchased this controller in June of 2020. By December of 2020, the left thumbstick didn't work properly and the right trigger stop was broken where it could not be used at all. I opened up a warranty case on 12/05/2020 with Razer. They first sent over a list of questions asking when the issue occurred, was it working properly previously, description of what the issue is etc. After responding to that email they wanted a video showing the controller is not working properly. So I had to record myself using the controller and simultaneously show how the functions were not working on the screen and not working on the controller. I then had to upload this video and once they reviewed it and determined if was defective and under warranty they sent the case to another department who sends you instructions for getting your replacement. That department reaches out with instructions providing you a Return Authorization Number and a FedEx prepaid postage. I then had to find a box, pack the controller, write the Return Authorization Number on the box (otherwise they won't accept it) and they state that you have to print out the email thread with all the correspondence and put it in the box as well. Once all that was done I had to go to a FedEx location to ship it out and wait for them to receive it, process the replacement and then mail it back. This all started on 12/05/2020 and I received my replacement on 12/31/2020, almost a full month later. In the meantime I had to buy a regular Xbox controller so further funds were wasted. I get my Razer replacement on 12/31/2020, plug it in today for the first time 01/02/2021 and the ""X"" button doesn't work on the replacement. As if the process wasn't long enough, the replacement they sent me is broken out of the box. A simpler process would have been that once they accepted the controller was defective, to send a new one and with the new one send a return label so u could use the same box and just affix the new label. That way you aren't waiting for them to receive your broken controller before sending you a new one.

  If you are use to the normal Xbox one controller then don’t buy this. Garbage waste of money controller. Thought maybe for one second I’d get a controller that may be a bit different and useful, but turns out I’d rather use the messed up brand new Xbox controller I have. Tbh I think the elite controller feels better in every way. Garbage garbage garbage for 150. Imagine smashing like the a button flat in a normal controller so that way it barley clicks back up and that’s how the buttons feel on this. Just frustrated when you push kinda hard up on the anolog stick and it comes out messing up your gameplay. So hopefully you go somewhere like GameStop and try it out so that way you don’t experiment like me and end up wasting money

  Took all of 5 months for the infamous right stick drift to start. (A constant issue across the Razer forums that appears to specifically point to this issue being a large deal amongst the Amazon sold controllers). Nothing tried has fixed it. If you insist on buying the Wolverine TE, order from Razer directly, not Amazon. Not saying the problem is directly specific to JUST Amazon sold controllers, but after some research across the forums, that is the conclusion I came to.

  Really dig this controller, had the wildcat for a year until the left analog stick started to malfunction, received a new one under the warranty since it was just over 1 year. Decided to keep the wildcat as a backup and purchased this model, the Wolverine Ultimate. Pretty disappointed though because I've only had it 4 months and the right analog stick is defective, turns normal speed to the left but very slow to the right. Only happens on games with tight aiming controls like R6 Siege, etc. Still a bummer though bc when playing certain games I have to use the wildcat to prevent the issue. Going to contact Razer yet again for info on another return.Overall, great controller, I'd like to think I just got a bad one.

  I play Rocket League a lot. I can kill a normal Xbox One controller in 3 months playing a lot, as that is pretty much the only game I play. Issue with me is the left thumbstick wears out. So I usually by a cheap controller every 3-4 months and replace it (like $30) vs Xbox One or ""premium controller"" which cost a lot.Tried this one out, EXACT same thing. Left thumbstick now drifts after buying it on Jan 12th. Everything felt very nice / ""premium"" over the cheap Chinese controllers from the start. After about a month, left stick starts drifting.There is ZERO difference in the ""quality"" how this holds up vs a cheap aftermarket controller.  The grip feels better, and the buttons have a bit more of a ""click"" to them. It wears out the exact same as the cheap controllers.

  Save your money on this one guys, especially if you’re used to regular Xbox controllers. After just one day my right stick started drifting. For $150 that should not happen.The light in the middle constantly flashes this super bright, distracting light that can’t be turned off, or dimmed, or even set to not be a strobe light, so it’s always in your face blinking. Playing call of duty, I kept accidentally switching my gun in the middle of shooting, because the buttons on the bottom of the controller, which are not remappable by the way, are too close to the handles so they get pushed unintentionally. The AXBY buttons click like a computer mouse more than an Xbox button and at first I liked that, then I realized it’s harder to tell when I’m pushing buttons in the heat of the moment. The rubber on the back, while good for grip, just made the controller feel sticky at times.Overall this controller wasn’t made to be used for more hardcore games even though that’s what it says it’s for. This isn’t a good controller, it’s a controller that’s trying to be cool and it’s not working. Idk maybe I just have big hands.

  As the Q/A below says, the controller is limited to only mapping the default Xbox buttons for PC users.At least with the Elite controller you can remap anything you like using reWASD.  Unfortunately using this controller it's impossible to remap to anything other than existing Xbox buttons.  Additionally, it does not work with your typical Razer Chroma drivers, and software.  It appears to use the same app that is present on the console.

You can reconfigure more on a pc though. All In all a great purchase and I love the controller!

  If you are a person that every dollar you spend matters, Id suggest trying to find a different controller. I have seen people write better than ELITE Controller by far and that is a straight out lie. They have probably never had a ELITE controller or are just trying to be a word of mouth advertiser. I dont know the durability yet since I just got it, but my 1st impression is just ""ehh"". The D-pad is way too stiff and it barely breaks the surface of the controller so it just feels clunky and I can see this being a problem for long game sessions. Takes way too much effort to use the D-pad for simple menu navigation. The left thumbstick feels short and the right thumb stick is too stiff. The paddle that is default to X has the same problem as the D-pad except not too stiff. My impression of the build is rushed and feels cheap. My ELITE controller felt great... felt premium. That is definitely my favorite controller, but the bumpers break way too easy. After 3 returns in 3 years, it is time to find a new favorite controller. Sadly, this controller is not it. If I hadnt made the mistake and bought the tournament edition when I wanted the ULTIMATE edition, my review could have been different. But the quality of this controller feels subpar... Im not even going to return it and exchange it for the slightly higher priced controller. I dont think the results will be much better. If this controller does not feel any better within a week, I will probably sell it and go back to a standard Xbox controller again.I will tough it out until NOVEMBER when Elite Series 2 comes out and hopefully the bumper problem is fixed.Hey RAZER, some of us have plenty RGB in our PCs already. RGB will not sell your product over good construction. If it feels cheep, it usually is.

",5.0,RipCordSwoop,"Reviewed in the United States June 21, 2019","









  
  
    
  The power end that fits into the controller fits very snug-the way ALL power cords should fit. It has a deep lip that seats deeper inside the controller. When the cable gets pulled, stretched or yanked it protects the actual connection from becoming loose at the controller. I'm on my third Xbox Elite controller and every one at the connection on the controller is so loose that I have to play wireless. I tried taping the second Elite so I didn't have to buy another one but, the cable would come loose in the middle of game play. Do the math. I bought a third one- stupid stupid stupid. Do the math. The paddles for me are good because I have long fingers and they do not get in my way unlike the Elite controller that has the paddles closer to the outside of the handles. I haven't programed the paddles because I find I like the position and the default mapping of the controller just fine. It works. It's been two months and the quality is holding up just fine. All so, the built-in sound controller is easy and a step up from the adapter, a couple of taps and I'm all set. Bar-none the best controller I've used yet. Give it a try  I have used the controller 1 year now and it has performed very well indeed. Then the controller stopped receiving power.Someone online said its the power cord. I don't know. It might be. If I wiggle it around just right a small flash of power lights up the controller then stops. The connection ports on both ends look fine. The cord was not yanked over the 6 months. The quality of the controller is fantastic apart from this. It looks brand new still. If it is the cord please fix this. I guess I'm going to try another cord. I'll keep you posted.

Both controllers have remappable buttons inside the left and right triggers. No one else adds extra buttons in this location and they really need to get on board! It’s perfect to assign your jump and weapon swap to. And the buttons on the back are in much more comfortable positions. And with it being wired I unplug it from the Xbox and into my PC and it’s instantly ready to go. I didn’t even have to run the remapping process again on PC. Elite, Scufs...

  Smaller lighter and feels better in my hand than either of the Official Xbox Elite controllers. The software offers more options beyond just remapping the buttons. The lighting, vibration and stick sensitivity can all be changed with the Wolverine software. Unlike it's bigger brother, the Ultimate, and the Elite series, the configurations can't be altered while actively playing. Having gone through four Elite controllers, I feel more confident in the Wolverine's design and quality than the Elite series. The Wolverine is not over engineered, which is why I think it is able to be sold at a lower price point than the Elites. The Wolverine is not some shoddy knock off, it is well made and sturdy.

  If you're going to be forced to overpay to get a decent Xbox-style controller that doesn't feel like fragile cheap plastic but still bristle at the price-gouging of a normal controller, you might as well overpay a little bit more to get a nice controller instead. Great button action, some extra paddles on the back for people who play competitive games (I guess, I don't use them) and the cord is resilient enough to endure my cats periodically chewing on it, which was part of my decision-making process. It has some minimal random RGB cycling on the face if you're into that thing.

They wore off within a fortnight.Excellent when it works; You must ask yourself if you're willing to shell out the in game currency for that amount of use time.I shall bitterly miss the extra bottom switches which allow changing direction while executing slides etc.

  I decided to go with this controller over buying a new Elite 2. Had the Elite 1 and within a year a had severe stick drift. I became accustomed to the trigger pull modified and the paddles on the back. After reading some reviews I decided to give this one a shot. After only a few days of light to moderate use I noticed the ABXY buttons began to only register 2 out of every 3 buttons presses. Also I feel like the back buttons protrude out too much. The wire hits them and on more than one occasion I accidentally hit the paddles/back buttons. So I will be returning this item and going with something else.

  Very smooth design, solid build the buttons click similar to a mouse and the Razer synapse app is easy enough to use to remap your buttons. One setback and may be only my experience is that i have to unplug  controller sometimes then plug back in to have the sound come through to the connected headphones. There is a quick disconnect on the cord and may be a little touchy on mine but seems to be working fine now. Another thing to note if you use kontrol freeks  they will not easily pop on there without some slight modifications. Other than that solid purchase although a bit expensive for a wired only controller.

    Xbox Elite is Better
  
",2.0,Stephen,"Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  Xbox Elite controller is better in many ways. First of all the triggers of the Elite are butter smooth compared to the Wolverine. Then the buttons on the back (the primary reason I bought this controller) are too far for my fingers to reach comfortably. They are a lot further than they looked; I have to stretch to reach the buttons, and the buttons are slick so I can't hold them down for long without my fingers slipping. I suppose if you're just pressing them once it's okay, but by default they're mapped on buttons that I hold down (B and A). Which brings up another really annoying thing: you can't remap the buttons on PC. Made by gamers for gamers? Oof razer.- Review is coming from a razer fan too :(

  I bought this thing under the assumption that the programmable buttons can be bound to keyboard inputs, sadly I have never been more wrong, the customization ends with normal button inputs being mapped to either the buttons between the triggers or the -top- buttons on the back -only- the bottom programable buttons are -not- mapable to another button press, probably ok for xbox but for PC it seems the best controller option is the Elite, Razer has lost a potential customer due to this, as they are primarily a PC peripheral company you would think they would offer full PC mapping for their own product, disappointed, do better on the next version Razer

",5.0,Elvin,"Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2019","









  
  
    
  So far after using this controller for about a month I’d say it’s the best Xbox controller I’ve ever used. It’s wired which for me is a plus because I never have to charge it or change batteries in it and the cord is about 10 ft which is long enough for me and is a very thick braided cable so I never worry about it. I love that the face buttons feel like clicking a mouse it makes the whole experience feel more fluid and responsive especially for action games or fighting games. I also don’t notice any lag with this controller like I did with my Xbox wireless controller which I found most notable when playing fighting games. The paddles on the back feel very solid and at first are a bit of a pain to reach but once you get used to where they are then it’s very easy to reach you won’t even have to think about it. The Razer Synapse app is very easy to use on Xbox and lets you really customize your controller for any game that you play and you can name your presets as well so you can easily find them later. The controller will also let you store 2 presets at a time and quickly toggle between them on the fly. You can also mute the headset with the press of a button if you need to which I do find to be useful when playing your games and you know it’s muted because the button has a red slash through it. So overall I think it’s a great controller but it’s definitely not for everyone, it’s very expensive yes and the 150 dollar price tag had me hesitant to buy it so I cant recommend it to everyone. If you don’t mind the price though and want a good pro controller for your Xbox then I’d recommend this controller to you. This is my first pro controller I’ve never used the Xbox Elite controller so I can’t compare this controller to it but my experience so far has been a positive one and hopefully this review will help you make an informed purchasing decision.

    Rarely works with Xbox One S
  
",1.0,Arnoldo Chavez,"Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2018","









  
  
    
  I got this controller thinking it would work all the time. After all, it is connected directly through the Xbox with a wire. It should work way more than a wireless controller, correct? Nope. On my Xbox One (regular Xbox One I got when it first released) it would work I would say 60% of the time I turned my Xbox on. The rainbow lights would turn in, but the other light under the Xbox logo on the controller would not. The solution to this is fairly simple: disconnect the wire and reconnect it to the controller. Although simple, it is highly inconvenient and very irritating. I purchased an Xbox One S and I found that it will never work with the Xbox One S upon activation of the Xbox. I would turn the Xbox on and spend 5 minutes unplugging and re-connecting the controller in order to get it to work. This is extremely frustrating as a wireless controller works way best. It's too late for me to get a return for this so I basically wasted $160 but please, don't make the mistake of purchasing this. Other than the technical issues, the controller is well designed. The rainbow lights makes you think of Razer of course which is good. The 6 extra buttons come in handy. I just wish the controller worked.

  The hardware feels nice and sturdy. I like the ability to change the D-Pad and thumbsticks to be more fighting game friendly. Unfortunately, the software is hard to use. Razer Synapse 2 and 3 do not work to control RGB on controllers although they are Razer's recommended control panels. I had to use Razer Controller for X Box through the Microsoft Store to be able to change lights and buttons. Going to the Microsoft Store's website said the software was currently unavailable, but going through the desktop application allowed the software to download and install. As a whole, the hardware for the controller is great. The software is lacking though and in general it was a mess to find the supported version.

  I play Apex and call of duty 90% of gaming and had 2 paddles for A and B. I only used A and played on tactical. I’ve had the controller well over 3 years, the RB and LB were falling apart, kept together with tape and it was time for a new controller.I own the Astro A40+mixamp and the mixamp wire started to fail on me after 2 years. Luckily they gave me one with just the 3.5mm plug in case. Well the mixamp wire had a built in chat adapter and I missed is a lot. It was easier to mute my mic, mute party chat and hear the sound effects only.I ordered this last night and it came in before I woke up. Day 1 of use and I was in training mode for at least 2 hrs. Found some binds other users have posted online and used some of their binds and just kept it there. I use 4 out of the 6 buttons, coming from 1 paddle. There’s so many buttons to get use to. I use the jump button on the opposite from my old controller so most of the time I’ve been jumping just to get use to the jump. I’ve played a few games and I kept forgetting where my fingers were in a gunfight. After a 6 hrs my hand were aching because I was trying to grip too hard to reach the paddles on the back. I have to get my hands use to the controller but I won a few games with some decent plays. My aim does not sway as much and I turned my sensitivity up. It was on point! All and all it’s a good controller. Just wish the paddles were place elsewhere. I’m taking a break now but I’m about to get back to killing gamers online!! Lol

  Big words to give a product right? Ye, I know but here's why. Every OEM controller has one problem and it's that the area under the analog stick sheers away little by little every time leaving dust that could work its way in and under the controller cover possibly screwing with the sensitivity to the stick. The Razer Wolverine doesn't do that. It has a metal neck on the analog stick that prevents wear and tear! Jesus christ what a controller saver. The XYAB buttons aren't deep press buttons, they're mouse click buttons meaning less travel and ambiguity. The LB and RB triggers can be adjusted from long to short! I don't have to explain about the 4 extra macro buttons do I? The only thing you gotta know is that those macro buttons CAN'T have pc shortcuts. They can only use remapped controller buttons. The controller can store 2 sets of macros and there's a a button to swap between macro sets on the fly.My only gripe with the controller? I've got big hands and the L and R buttons are slanted and make it awkward to press. Other than that? Nothin.With a particular dongle that can we used on any console from Switch, PS4, Xbox, and PC, I use this controller for everything cuz... it's too damn good! I could care less for flashing lights on it. I turned those off :D

  Pros:-The swappable thumbsticks/dpad on the ultimate are great. I prefer the taller thumbstick on the left and have been very happy with that feature.-The overall feel of buttons and grip is better than a standard XB1 controller. (More on that later)-I've had no issues with stick drift, which was my primary reason for upgrading to this vs my original XB1.-The wired connection is secure, the cord itself is of good quality, and it's plenty long enough for any normal use.Cons:-As many other reviewers have said, the extra buttons aren't really useful at all since you can't bind them to anything custom. I use this on my PC and would have hoped there'd be a way to make them a bit more useful.-After 6 months of use, the A button on my controller is sticking badly. This is the reason for a 3 star review. My buttons weren't sticking like this on a standard XB1 controller after multiple years of use, so having this issue so quickly is really unimpressive. I have reached out to support and will update this review if I get any kind of useful response.-Update: cleaning with rubbing alcohol temporarily solves the problem, but I'm now basically cleaning it every other day. Not the best solution.

    5 stars for quality- 1 star for design
  
",3.0,MaysEffect,"Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2021","









  
  
    
  Well to start off positive, this controllers quality in the couple days i've had it has been top notch, zero faults there. BUT!This controller suffers from the same issues i have with the standard xbox one design (and is probably the same reason everyone generally prefers the 360 controller), which is the joysticks and triggers. THEY ABSOLUTELY SUCK in comparison to the originally 360 controller design for just about every game i play. The key issues is spring pressure and feedback. Just like the original xbox one controllers the triggers have absolutely no resistance which make it difficult to modulate pressure and return. The joysticks on the other hand suffer from too much lever action, the sticks feel longer and fall over way too quickly from its fixed position, which sucks because the initial pressure to get it moving is stiffer than at the extremities of its travel. This is just not good for anything. I use to get away with running at a high level with racing games with the 360 controllers, now its nearly impossible. Modulating brake pressure, acceleration, and turning is snappy and hard to control with this controller. In shooting games it is hard to keep the linear motion accurate thanks to the poor joystick feel.The pro's compared to the 360 controllers is everything that isn't primary. The grips generally feel much better although slightly shorter which i dont really care for. The primary buttons and d-pad have much more feel and positive clicks. Outside of this, nothing about this xbox one design is better.As such i don't recommend this unless you specifically prefer the xbox one controller over the 360 (WHICH I ABSOLUTELY DO NOT). I might be showing my age here, but what worked for me 10+ years ago, works just fine for me now, these changes don't help me at all. I hope Razer makes a xbox 360 design compared to this One design. There is a reason there are more replica 360 controllers on the market than these. THEY ARE BETTER.I'd easily give this a 2-stars if there was any quality problems to note. But Luckily Razer designed a high quality...bad product. I think they refer to this as ""polished doodoo"".

  As a big fan of Razer for the past several years, I really was excited that they made a new controller when I wasn't able to buy their 360 ones before they went off the store. This thing looked cool and exciting showing off extra buttons, rgb, and mechanical switches on a controller! Trade offs being that its wired only but hey this still sounds great. If only Razer went the full mile...I fully understand that this was meant to be for an Xbox one, I get that, but Xbox controllers are commonly used on PC so I figured, the company Razer would make their software detect this controller. But PC synapse doesn't recognize it at all. You have to go to the windows store (oh yes) and download the Xbox one synapse app on your windows PC to be able to customize this controller. To which you will only be able to rebind the buttons using other controller inputs. They end up just getting in the way at this point unless you are really into it which I wasn't since I just wanted to remap extra features to it.Well it still has mechanical keys right! And yea it does, its kinda cool. Still can't decide if I like or dislike em tho. They make a satisfying little click noise which makes me happy (I use Razer greens on my keyboard just for this sensation) but something doesn't feel right. Unfortunately I don't own another Xbox one controller anymore so I can't compare it directly but I had fond memories of using it with my PC but i'm not getting that same vibe. Its gotten to the point I use my ps4 remote or pro controller more often now. D-pad is really bad for platformers but not so bad for Arpgs like a souls game. (easy to hit 1 key but not easy to shift direction with it).Lastly we got some rgb. Makes everything better right? Since we are in gimped synapse, we get even less features. Bright side the thing remembers what you set it to unlike every other Razer product ( I guess they accidentally learned what that on-board memory they keep selling us is for). Its meh, I have mine flash every time rumble features goes off to trigger the people around me.Overall its an alright controller. But this thing is priced to be an upgraded controller. So unless you are really curious and a Razer fan on an Xbox 1 I cant recommend this product. It's pc compatibility is awful, customization is terrible, and I can't even consistently use it over a cheaper product. It's stupid to fanboy but I did like the unique products Razer goes out and creates and am willing to pay a bit extra for their darkened edgy Razer designs but when they release half assed products like this it burns.TL;DR - Its a hit or miss if you will like it, Dont buy it for PC usage its worse than a normal one, rgb bruh, bad dpad. RIP RAZER

  The mechanical switches are amazing and build quality feels very solid. Unfortunately I play a lot of racing games and while the bumper is held down and the trigger is pulled they collide; sometimes stopping the trigger from releasing. This wont be a problem if you mostly play anything besides racing games or you do not use the manual gearbox option, but is definitely something to keep in mind if you're playing a lot of Forza/BeamNG.I'm sure this could be solved by a slight modification to the trigger/bumper, but most people won't be willing to disassemble and potentially file pieces of their $100 controller down out of the box.

    Razer Wolverine Review (coming from an XB1 Elite controller)
  
",4.0,TB,"Reviewed in the United States April 5, 2019","









  
  
    
  Bought the Razer Wolverine Tournament Edition controller after my Elite controller started having issues. The left stick had started to drift up without touching it which became vary annoying. After doing some research I found out that it was a common problem along with grips coming off. After reading about the consistent quality issues I decided it was best to look elsewhere.Quick Review:Score 4/5I decided to go with the Razer Wolverine due to it not needing a charge (I sit at large desk where my xbox and monitor are so no need for a wireless controller). Also I wanted something that delivered similar performance and features and the Razer Wolverine is a great choice. Joysticks are extremely responsive and I like that the buttons on the controller are integrated. The only downsides to this controller are that I cannot fit my XB1 kontrolfreeks on it since the top of the sticks are larger. I have read that PS4 or old Xbox 360 kontrolfreeks work so I have ordered them to try as well. The other downsides include the price and how ""plasticky"" the controller is. For the same price as an XB1 Elite controller, it should have some metal components. I paid $110 at the time so I'm not that upset.Overall I am very satisfied with this controller over the Elite. I do not consider this an upgrade from the Elite, but is a solid alternative to those looking for one. If you can get the Wolverine at the same price point as me or lower I think it's a no brainer over the Elite.

    Great Controllr, Crappy cable
  
",4.0,Paul Atrat,"Reviewed in the United States December 13, 2018","









  
  
    
  First off I love this controller for my Xbox. The additional buttons on the inside of the bumpers are great for remapping D-pad buttons and allowing for smoother game play since you don't gave to take your thumb off of the analog stick. This means you no longer have to stop moving in a game just to swap weapons or abilities in some games.  The controller itself is solid, light weight, buttons do not have to be pressed very hard to be used, definitely a pro level controller.The problem is that this is my second controller. The other controller still works, but just like all Razer hardware, the USB cables are proprietary which is just stupid. In a world where USB C has the ability to be used on anything, Razer still thinks that they have to create proprietary plug shapes for the cable and the actual device itself, so you can't just grab a new USB cable and use it. If I was able to at least purchase a new cable, I would have given this a 5 start rating, but because they are not available on the Razer site, I just got a new one. I mean wake up. Even Apple got rid of their stupid proprietary ports and plugs and is now universal. This is a serious problem in my mind. I will happily change this to a 5 start rating if Razer fixes this issue.

",1.0,"Bridges, John","Reviewed in the United States September 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is the worst controller I have ever owned. It could have been a great controller, but for some reason they have it set up to randomly shut the Dpad off.  That is correct, you read that right.  While playing a game, the Dpad just stops functioning, and you have to either swap profiles twice or un plug and replay it in to fix it.  After that is done it might only work for a couple of seconds before it shuts off again.  Now normally, I would contact support to see if there is a settings issue somewhere, but absolutely no support is offered.  I tried going through the website and they tell me that they won't give me support.  This is the last razer product I will ever buy due to the outrageously bad ""feature"" and lack of support.  I have spent thousands on razer gear over the years, and to be treated like this is absolutely abhorrent.  DO NOT BUY.

  First off, I do like this controller. I like the fact that it has RGB and how the buttons click. But I got this because I was told that I can remap the buttons so RB was RT and LB was LT like you can on the Elites. You can only remap the M buttons. I have a disability and it's hard for me to play FPS because aim is LT and fire is RT. I have an Elite Series 2 but the right bumper doesn't respond the way it should. Guess I'll be buying most of my games for the PS5 because the remapping ability is built right into the system.

  The buttons seem appropriately sensitive and I like the weight of a wired controller and that if I drop it for whatever reason I can catch it by the wire. This controller isn't hard wired but the wire clips in with an additional retainer as opposed to just the mini usb plug.What I don't like...There are a bunch of extra buttons and maybe that's cool for somebody but I think it's dumb and I accidentally hit them all the time. It's even more dumb that they can only duplicate the functions of the other buttons and seem more sensitive than the ""hair trigger"" setting on the bumpers. The number of times I've accidentally jumped over things in The Division to my demise would boil the blood. My buddy, who prefers wireless controllers and has to listen to my expletives, always says ""I told you to go with the fancy Microsoft controller.Also, the chroma whatever-they-call-it light is really dumb. Why people want their computers to light up will always baffle me. The light is so bright that it's distracting when it's night and there is no ambient light. You can install a program on your computer to manage this light and reassign buttons but I don't want more stuff running on my machine.Personally, I've always found the classic microsoft wired controllers to work well but now, apparently, you can't get decent wired controllers anymore. Batteries and charging are annoying and I now have to pay over $100 to solve a problem that cost 40 just a few years ago.Anyway, this controller is decent and I'd buy it again knowing the options I've got but it's gimmicky and over-engineered.

  Chief among them are the chat or I should say inability to control the chat. First whomever you are talking to and whether it be in a party or team chat will hear a loud buzzing and it is most definitely the controller. Because the same headset with two other controllers does not present this buzzing. Also you cannot control the headset volume and the slider function so You cannot control how much chat volume versus game volume is in your headset. The Xbox does not recognize a headset plugged into the controller fully. It does seem to halfway because the headset icon is in the upper right hand corner but it will still not let you control it where it should (see pictures).In addition to the aforementioned, the back buttons are actually hard to reach.

",2.0,Brenden,"Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  I decided to go out of my comfort zone and buy this controller because i thought it looked great. It was awesome for the first few months.... I have owned this controller now for 7 months.Pros: Face buttons (ABXY) are mechanical and feel amazing, one of the best qualities of the controller. Thumbsticks are very responsive and interchangeable and the LEDs look phenomenal. Also it being wired makes the input lag almost non existent, and bye bye batteries.Cons: After less than a year the Mic port is now not functioning well and causes my headsets to pop and crackle in parties, and i cant hear the left side of my headset unless i hold the jack in a precise spot, and i tested other controllers and the headset works perfectly fine. Cant use the back paddles at all, i dont have the ridiculously long fingers that this controller requires in order to comfortably use the back paddles. Dont try to reinvent the wheel... The placement of the paddles on the elite controller are perfect, these run down the direct center of the controller and you can barely touch it with the tips of your fingers. The second set of bumpers kind of suffer the same fate where as they are just not conveniently placed for use.Consensus: I really want to love this thing, but the fact that the mic port quit functioning properly on a 150 dollar controller not even a year after purchase is what killed me the most. The face buttons more than made up for the lack of use on the back paddles. I wish they would resolve this and allow me to replace the controller, but unfortunately i do not believe this will be the case.Do yourself a favor and buy the elite 2. it may not have flashy LED's but the ability to use the back paddles will more than make up. If paddle use doesn't matter and you are just solely looking for a better feeling controller, this one is great, minus the mic port.

Honestly, it's a neat feature that I didn't realize I wanted or needed until I tried it, and now I'm glad I have it.

  Great remote, I looked into multiple remotes including scuff and Xbox elite. Through people I have talked to with both, I decided to get this one. Buttons on bottom are perfect both in placement and response as well as the ones on the index fingers. The index finger and front buttons are all clicky like a computer mouse. Wire doesn't bother me, in fact I prefer it. Only complaints are that it is hard to put all the items in the travel case and there is no long-rounded joystick option.

  At first I liked it but the longer I used it the less I cared to use it.  If you have large hands this is not the controller for you.  The bumper buttons at the top are too close together.  I keep hitting them by mistake.  But the biggest problem is the lag.  There is some serious trigger lag.  The materials used to make it are quality (opposite of Scuf... cheapo) but the response of the triggers are terrible.

  I bought this because someone I lent out my Elite 2 controller to broke it. This is a good controller. I like the clickiness of the A B X Y buttons, which gives a satisfying response. I like the RGB light though I wish it were programmable to light up with the rest of my razer RGBs on my PC. There's many things about this controller that are bad about it, however.The extra keys are only remappable to other buttons on the controller. If you were hoping to press keys on your keyboard using the extra triggers, then you'll be sad.If you lose one of the small thumbsticks by accident, there is absolutely no way to get a new one. There's no third party sticks anywhere. Talking to Razer Support will have them tell you to just buy new ones from their website (Which there are none. Many people on their forums are complaining about this. The only one available is the ""long module"", which is missing both the standard and ball top thumbsticks) So if you're a person that never loses sticks held on by magnets, then this may be the controller for you.

  Bought this controller back in May and the right thumb stick has already gone out, buttons failing and seems to have a mind of its own. While playing FPS, the weapon will start drifting, firing on its own and and not moving in the direction that the thumb stick has moved to. 6 months out of a controller for the price that was paid is a complete rip off. If I wanted to keeping buy controllers, I would by the cheap ones cause they would last at lease 9 months.

  I got this controller refurbished for 80 bucks, totally worth it. Previously I was playing on a regular xbox controller for basically all my gaming. I tried the ps4 controller here and there as well but this is by far a better option than either of the stock options for consoles. I bought this after I got a dedicated gaming PC and wanted a controller with the additional paddles and a more premium feeling to it. I can say having used it both with my PC and Xbox that it is well worth the price. Some people complain about the buttons being hard to push but I barely use those anymore as the paddles mainly replace them. The trigger stops are nice for the shorter travel and the wire is long enough to reach your console from basically anywhere in the room.  The rubber pieces on the sticks are thicker and much more durable than a stock controller, and I'm pretty sure the sticks can be replaced when they wear out. The set up was easy and painless, no issues with drivers or any other problems. Added benefit is I never run out of batteries mid game and have to scramble to replace them.Cons- I would say the additional set of bumpers included right next to the traditional bumpers on the controller are a little hard to reach for integration into a FPS style game. That being said I have not really put much effort into using/ learning them and have only had the controller for a couple months. The Idea that those would replace a second set of paddles on the back is a little laughable as they would require the use of your fingers you would use for aiming and shooting.ConclusionI would recommend you get this controller if you are looking for something that is better than a stock console controller for your PC or Xbox. The ergonomics are great, the zero lag and extra paddles definitely give you the opportunity to bring your gameplay up a notch. It feels very sturdy and well built and for the investment should outlast a regular controller 2-3 times.  I wouldn't get this controller to replace something with 4 sets of paddles on the back or if you intend to play on the PlayStation. I also wouldn't get this controller if you feel like you absolutely must have a wireless controller or say have a 25ft -15ft gap between your couch and gaming station ( quite unlikely)

  Let me start with that I also own the Elite using both factory and SCUF paddles. So this is a comparison.This controller blows the Elite out of the water. The weight on this controller is significantly less than the Elite so it’s more comfortable. The button placement/style means almost 0 accidental pushes of the buttons (Elite owners know the pain). Wolverine is a corded controller but comes with plenty of cable to reach the Xbox. Wolverine requires an app to be downloaded to your Xbox to customize the controller. App is extremely easy to use and almost every minor detail of the controller can be custom configured.Overall, I would repurchase this controller again, and over the Elite.

",5.0,Matt,"Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2021","









  
  
    
  At the bottom will be the pros and cons if you want to skip to that.They got rid of the buttons on the back from the first version, which is great for me.  The wildcat was one of my favorite controllers, and I did like having the option to add the buttons on the back if I wanted to.  But, I found the buttons on the back to be a tad excessive in the end. With the Razer Wolverine V2 you get the extra bumpers without the nuisance of anything getting in the way of your grip.  The material they used around the grips makes it easy to hold the controller firmly. It felt awkward at first due to the grips formation, but quickly got over that. 0 drift on the controller even when I removed the dead zones.  This is a hard quality to find, no matter the controller from my experience.If you are looking to buy a controller I would highly recommend.Pros (Based on my personal preferences)-0 drift, buttons feel great and responsive. (Not sure if I got lucky with the 0 drift on the joysticks. Haven't seen any complaints about it yet.)-Comfortable, and the grips make it easy to hold the controller firmly. (I really like the material they used)-They removed the buttons on the back of the controller used in the previous versions. Liked the option to have them at first, but in the end I found them to be a tad excessive.-Best controller for the price.  (PowerA's fusion pro controller would be a close 2nd for $80, but it falls short in my opinion.  It's not a bad option though if you like the elite's paddle style.)(You will need to download the Razer application to program the buttons as well as tweak any other settings to your liking.  This applies to PC and Xbox users.  Application can be found in the Microsoft Store.)Possible Cons (Depending on your preference, none of these bother me in the slightest)-Doesn't have interchangeable joysticks or buttons-You aren't able to remove the cable from the controller. Does have the breakaway towards the USB side.-Cable's material is standard, and not the mesh you normally see from a Razer product.That's it, hope this info was helpful.  Like the direction they took with this one.  Simplified and refined would be a good way to describe this controller.  2 extra buttons are all I need,  and I love the placement of the buttons next to the bumpers.  I will update the cons list later depending it's longevity.  If it's like the Wildcat in the regard I have high hopes. (That controller is 4 years old and still works lol.)  Sorry if this review was too long, I do not write reviews very often.

  I bought this controller after my gen 1 Xbox Elite Controller started getting unacceptable left stick drift and had broken LB twice. I wanted the gen 2 Elite, but I decided to give this a shot. My main game is Rocket League, so this isn't from the perspective of a shooter main.I've only had it about a month so I can't speak to it's durability, but I will update the review if something becomes a problem. (see update at bottom)As far as features of the controller, it is packed. There are 6 programmable buttons in addition to the default Xbox layout; 4 on the back and 2 on the top. This is ""tournament ready"", so these buttons can only be mapped to existing Xbox functions, there is no option for keyboard shortcuts or macros. You can also use ""Agile"" and ""Focus"" if you are into shooters. The Chroma lighting is cool but obviously purely fluff, I made it as dim as possible.The build quality seems good. It doesn't have the heft of an Elite controller, which is more from not having a battery than it is from cheaper materials. The light weight makes it very comfortable for long gaming sessions, and the cable is high quality with a breakaway design in case it gets yanked.Comfort/ergonomics are great, but took getting used to. The Elite controller has it's paddles positioned on the back of the grips, so you wrap your fingers around the controller to hold it. That is more natural to me, so the Elite controller fit right into my flow without any problems. The Wolverine positions the back paddles in the middle of the controller, which means you cannot wrap your fingers all the way around the grips and still use the buttons. This took a lot of getting used to, but now that I am comfortable with it I actually find it encourages a much more light and deft grip on the controller. The Elite encourages you to squeeze tightly, and I had to actively fight that urge to maintain quicker and lighter presses. The Wolverine forces you to hold the controller with less force, and as such my comfort and dexterity have increased after the switch.Along the same lines, the buttons are super clicky and tactile, feeling more like a mouse press than a button as others have said. This also encourages lighter and faster touches, as opposed to the forceful mashing that I was used to on the mushy membrane Elite buttons.So overall it is a supremely comfortable controller to use for long gaming sessions once you have gotten used to the required grip, and it has all the features you could want for a ""tournament ready"" controller. Here's to hoping it doesn't break tomorrow.Update: So it didn't break TOMORROW per se, but it definitely hasn't held up well. Within the first 3 months the right stick started to drift pretty bad. In Rocket League that only impacts camera angle, so it wasn't the end of the world and I kept playing with it. I had pretty bad stick drift on my left stick on my gen 1 Elite controller after about a year which was way worse to deal with. About 2 months ago the bottom left button on the back of the controller started feeling looser than normal. As of today it has fully broken and cannot be pressed anymore. I will probably just re-map that button to the one above that I didn't use, but it's not a good sign that within a year I've had a button break and pretty massive stick drift.Also, after about 9 months of use and after switching to a wireless keyboard and mouse, I'm starting to regret buying a wired controller. There isn't a noticeable difference in latency and while the lighter weight is nice, the cord makes it about as cumbersome as a heavier wireless controller all things considered.Unfortunately, poor quality control seems to be a requirement for ""pro""-grade controllers (Xbox Elite Gen 2, anything Scuf, this one from Razer) so there isn't a clear winning alternative. If you are ok with a wire and are ok with accepting the potential for stick drift or the occasional broken button, this is still an excellent controller ergonomically and I love the clicky buttons. I'd be way more harsh (2 stars total) if it wasn't such a common thing amongst these types of controllers across the spectrum. I just wish I didn't have to expect those problems when paying double the normal rate for a controller.

Whether you use a chat mixer or not no matter what it has got horrible feedback that people I play with can not stand. Also all the controller buttons the paint has worn right off.

   UPDATE 11/24/2017:The audio bug I reported in my original review is now finally fixed. After working extensively with Razer support (who have been great) and two replaced controller it was finally determined to be a firmware bug as predicted. They issued a new firmware v1.02.00 which fixes the issue . So if you experience the audio bug I faced you should contact Razer support to get the firmware updater . I now full, 200% recommend this controller . The only reason I am not bumping my original rating from 4 stars is to recognize the existence of this initial (but resolved) issue I'm an avid console FPS gaming enthusiast and spend a significant portion of my game time playing online competitive multiplayer games like Titanfall 2, Battlefield 1 ,  Overwatch, Halo 5 etc. And just like me I'm sure you will come to a point where you'll realize that the stock OEM Xbox controller doesn't really cut it. Hence I have a amassed quite the collection of 3rd party controllers including my current favourite the Razer Wildcat controller  (before using the Wolverine controller that is). For this review I will compare the new Wolverine controller to the Wildcat controller, how it feels in hand while gaming and reasons why I had initially chosen the Razer Wildcat over the Xbox Elite controller ( all of which apply to the Wolverine controller as well)WHY I CHOOSE THE RAZER CONTROLLER OVER THE XBOX ELITE CONTROLLERWhen I first purchased my Wildcat I had spent an embarrassingly large amount of time researching between it and the Elite controller and in the end it came down to this :- If you read online forums, Reddit etc you'll quickly come to realize that the Elite controller is plagued with build quality issues and cheap plastic parts that break easily and on top of that the elite controller only has a 6 month warranty. These Razer controllers come with 1 year warranty. To me the the length of  warranty told me all I wanted to know about the confidence each of the manufacturer had in their product- The second thing that really seals the deal in favor of the Razer controllers (both Wildcat & Wolverine) is MECHANICAL buttons - You see even while costing $150 the elite controller had the same rubber domed ABXY buttons as the stock Xbox or any other cheap controllers. Rubber dome buttons do not provide the right feedback while intense gameplay as they tend to bottom out / fade away and 'stick' over time . Whereas the Razer controller feature proper mechanical switch ABXY buttons that are responsive , Clicky (just like a mechanical keyboard) and  feature a very short travel distance and actuation time- Well these two reasons were more than enough for me to look away from the elite controllerDESIGN &  BUILD QUALITY- From the first moment you unbox the Wolverine controller , open its velvet lined hardshell case and hold the controller in your hand - you realize that it just oozes with quality worthy of its asking price. It is neither too heavy nor too light , the matte finish plastic construction, triggers , trigger locks all feel solid and operate smoothly without any creaks and rattles- Unlike the Razer Wildcat controller where you have to stick the rubberized grips yourself which is hard to get right , the Wolverine controller now features a permanent rubberized dotted grip which works out much better in practice without adding too much bulk. It is very comfortable to hold/squeeze even with sweaty palms- The trigger stops are also better built and feel sturdier than Razer Wildcat controller- The four rear buttons on the rear of the controller ( M3 to M6) are made of plastic and are also of the mechanical switch type with very short actuation distance and clicky operation. One thing I would like to point out is that the rear triggers/buttons on the Wildcat controller are made of metal whereas they have switched to plastics for the new Wolverine controller- Another aspect where the Razer controllers are better than the Elite controller is their built in chat & program pad. You can quickly program the 6 customizable buttons without the help of any software and  quickly change assignments on the fly . It can store two profile assignments and also adjust chat and game volume-  You can swap the rubber domed metal- thumbsticks , D-pad out to match your preference whether you like the stock xbox controller feel, taller wider or dome shaped thumbsticks - there's one for every preference. While the magnets that hold the thumbsticks and D-pad is strong they can still come out if the controller falls or is kept face down . Hence i would recommend some caution there-  The reason why most of the 3rd party controllers on the market today are wired (with the sole exception of modded stock $170+ Scuff controllers) is because Xbox One uses a proprietary wireless protocol for their controllers which is probably very expensive to license, so its hard to be critical on this controller for being wired. Having said that the included 10 Ft nylon braided cable is durable and long enough for most gaming setups and can easily reach your couchPERFORMANCE, TRIGGER LOCKS & CUSTOM BUTTONS- Lets first talk about the trigger locks as they're one of main game changers when compared to stock controllers, as they limit the motion of the RT/LT triggers right upto their actuation point and cutting their 'dead' zone by almost 75%. If you prefer high precision or semi-automatic weapons in your FPS games, then you can get in significantly more number of shots faster than you would on a regular controller. The importance of that in a tense encounter with another player cannot be understated. Also unlike the Wildcat controller you dont have to activate a special 'Hair Trigger' mode on this controller as some games do not accurately recognize trigger locks . The Wolverine controller does that automatically the moment you engage the trigger locks. Very convenient indeed- The positioning for the additional shoulder buttons M1 & M2 is genius if you ask me and once you get used it , you will stop using the regular shoulder buttons LB & RB . That's because when your fingers are on the LT & RT fingers are already exactly where  the shoulder M1 & M2 buttons are located . That way you can operate them without having to lift your fingers off the triggers - Another advantage in multiplayer- The four buttons at the back M3 to M6 are ideally located and easy to reach , but it does take getting some used to for incorporating into your gameplay. But the thing is once you get used to it you cant do away with it - I find it very hard going back even to my Wildcat controller now!- By default the rear triggers M5 & M6 are configured for  two modes with the left rear trigger for a mode called 'Focus' which decreases the sensitivity of the  analog sticks by half as long as you keep M5 pressed (you can fine tune this in the Xbox Synapse app) . This allows you to carefully line up those headshots using sniper rifles . Pressing the right rear trigger activates the 'Agile' mode which doubles the analog stick sensitivity for faster response. Once you get the hang using these two mode - It does give you yet another very tangible advantage over your opponent- Of Course if you dont want to use the Focus & Agile modes you can always re-assign the rear triggers  M5 & M6 to any button you like. Think of of it - With the four rear buttons you could map the entire ABXY buttons to them and never have to move your fingers off the thumbsticks and the triggers ! ( as even the shoulder buttons M1 & M2 are right there)- Now for the Chroma lighting on the controller which I first thought was mainly gimmicky as you never get to see it  while you are actually gaming - But it does look cool for onlookers. What changed my view of it was a lighting mode called 'Immersive' which lights up as according to the controller's vibrations ie say when you fire a weapon it lights up or when you are running . It does look very cool- Check out the small clip i made of it in actionAN ANNOYING BUG- My only disappointment with this controller is a firmware bug I encountered where if you use the Wolverine to turn on the Xbox it does not activate the audio on the 3.5mm jack  and you have to do literally unplug the controller and plug the controller back in to get audio. Sometimes even the controller fails to turn on when you power on the Xbox- I contacted Razer support for this and they did RMA my first controller and since they did not have one in stock in their local warehouse they sent it to me from their Hong Kong warehouse with two day international shipping ! Kudos to them for that but even my second controller has the same issue.- I am decking one star for this bug alone. And the reason why I am not taking away more stars is because it can be fixed via a firmware update (which just happens to not be available yet) and they had the other similar issues with their Wildcat controller at launch which was fixed by a later firmware upgrade. I just hope it comes soon enough- I have the original Xbox  (not the S) and this bug happens on Xbox on both power saving and instant on modesFINAL THOUGHTSSo there you have it the Wolverine controller is miles better than their own Wildcat controller (and by extension the Xbox Elite controller) . It is so good that I dont like using my Wildcat anymore as it does give a very tangible edge to my gameplay and has better overall ergonomics and precision. The only thing I would like to caution you about is the audio bug I faced requiring you to unplug and replug the controller every time. I will update this review once there is a firmware update available but until then you'll have to decide if its a quirk worth living with or not. And according to me - It is...See you in the battlefield !

  Excellent response, joysticks are snappy and the button action is crisp. I’m the type that hates the lag of a wireless controller, and this one is far superior to using wireless. I’ve not yet programmed the paddles since I’m finding the standard layout’s responsiveness is sooooooo much better than standard wireless units.

",5.0,Marlo,"Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2018","









  
  
    
  I bought the Razer Wolverine Ultimate Chroma Controller back in January 2018 and it is still my main controller for XBOX. I specifically wanted a wired controller because I have a habit of letting the batteries die and during long play sessions, having to disconnect from party, change controllers or plug in mid game is annoying. I play at my desk on a monitor, so I have no need for wireless, and have gone through many standard controllers to warrant the need for something more durable. The wire is long enough though to reach your couch.I did think about the Elite Controller but I was worried about the overall build and materials, and the prices were jacked up since it was sold out for a long time. I ended up going with the Wolverine Ultimate and after almost a year of some serious gaming, it still looks and feels like the first day I got it.Over build is excellent! I’ve taken good care of it and it doesn’t leave my desk. The rage IS real and so far has overcome. The Metal triggers and bumpers are still in good condition after a year of use. A difference between the standard controllers which after some long use, my right bumper would always be worn in and hard to feel the response. The joysticks are also very durable and still have that grip that would usually be worn in and or torn on the standard controllers.  I like the rounded tip as my left joystick and have no issues with the joysticks ever falling out. I use the button D pad instead of the +. No issues with that popping out either. There is a HUGE difference in the ABXY buttons compared to the standards. They really do feel like mouse clicks almost. I really like this but at first touch I was skeptic. They react and respond quicker, doesn’t have that squishy feel. I did own one of the new premium controllers and like the standards, after a few weeks of use, the A button would get stuck. (GTA5/RD2). The Wolverine Ultimate really nailed it with the durability after a year of use. All mechanicals working like I first bought it.Although the price might be high, I think this product pays for itself. I would go through 2 fresh controllers a year to have them unusable. And they’re on average $55+ not including the battery pack. I think this controller can go through more years before showing any wear or tear. According to their website, my one year of use really backs all that negative testing they did with the controller. If something were to happen with mine in the future, I most certainly be considering buying The Wolverine Ultimate Chroma Controller again.Side Note:RGB color is sick! The case is super premium. The App works well and not hard to navigate.The X logo home button is slightly crooked when I first got it, but I couldn’t let that stupid cosmetic error justify a star.

    Great controller, but different. Bad bumpers
  
",4.0,Christopher C.,"Reviewed in the United States December 12, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've used a lot of controllers and this one is pretty good. The buttons on the back are excellent. The lightbar is bright and looks nice. The ABYX buttons are MUCH different than a normal controller. They basically ""click"" like a computer mouse. It takes awhile to get used to them.The D-Pad is great. One slight interesting note is that the Left D-Pad button seems to be a bit louder than the rest - hopefully that's alright.The extra buttons by the bumpers on the top are essentially useless. I have no clue why they're there. They're almost impossible to reach and to me it's a total waste of money and resources for them to include them.My biggest problem with this controller BY FAR are the bumpers. There's almost zero feedback. They feel almost like the triggers. There's no click. There's no audible or touch feedback. This is a massive problem as I use this controller to play Rocket League and I have the Drift button set as Left Bumper. Unless you're actively turning in the game, there's no visual feedback on-screen to show that the button is held down. So I'm in a situation where the game and controller are not giving any feedback at all on whether or not I'm using the handbrake in the game until I actually try to turn. And in Rocket League, that can result in a lot of problems quickly. If you think I'm exaggerating this, it's already caused multiple problems where I tried to quickly turn and I do a normal wide-turn because the button actually wasn't read as being pressed.Another small gripe is there feels to be an extremely faint uneven spot under the left analog stick. Very very faint but it feels like it has a slight bump or something. It's hardly noticable but the right stick feels smoother in comparison, which leads me to believe that there's a slight flaw in my left stick. Again, super faint but it could be the result of poor quality control.Overall, I'm happy with the controller. Microsoft's controllers are a JOKE when it comes to longevity so we'll see how this one holds up. The D-Pad alone is worth moving away from Microsoft's awful designs. Although they improved it with the Series X, I still prefer this D-Pad. So I'd still pick it over the Series X controller. (However do note this is a wired controller whereas the Xbox controllers have Bluetooth.)

  I have big, strong hands, and I play sweaty Rocket League matches. The regular Xbox One controller left analog sticks break down over time - I know because I've gone through several of them. The Razer Wolverine however is made of stern stuff. I don't care for the LED lighting, although maybe it's cool for a party trick or something, but the functionality of this controller is fantastic. The buttons are really nice to press and give a subtle click feedback. The analog controls seem completely linear and are easy to use for fine movements. I have no complaints about the software, it seems perfectly functional for what it is. It's easy to create and switch profiles for different games. All in all, it feels like the nicest Xbox One controller ever, if you're comfortable with the standard controller but want more precision and durability, this is the controller you want. I've never bought a Razer product before but I will be much more likely to consider the brand in the future based on how great this controller is.

  I purchased this controller on 1 - 23 - 2019, the date of this review is 4 - 13 - 2020. The past 2 or 3 weeks the ""A"" button has been automatically double jumping in Rocket League and finally today the button stopped working. It's a great controller when it works, but who wants to spend $100+ on a controller that is only going to last a year. I take really good care of my gear and play games about 10 to 15 hours a week. If this would've been my fault due to the fact I don't take care or am hard on my gear then that would be a different story. For being a ""tournament"" grade controller I don't think it held up. I would've been happy with 3 to 5 years of use out of this, but 1 year and almost 3 months doesn't cut it. The warranty is only a year, so time to purchase a different one.

    Great controller, but came with ever so slight stick drift
  
",3.0,Kaillais,"Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  I decided to buy this controller after my three normal controllers broke within 4 years, my first elite controller series 1 in just under a year, and my elite series 2 in just 5 months. I decided that this controller would be my end game controller with fingers crossed and knock on wood. I love this controller so far, and my big hands make the paddles on my ultimate placed perfectly with more comfort and dependability than both my elite controllers ever did. By the end of the rest of day one after work I played with it, I was already playing better than I ever did with the elite controllers.  The only problem I noticed and panicked about a bit was that it had very slight stick drift out of the box at times, although nowhere near all the time. I had gotten this for games like R6, which my elite series 2 needed a left stick deadzone of 50, and still had stick drift, or even didn't register forward movement of the left thumbstick. This controller was supposed to be my solution to dealing with stick drift entirely. It's easily manageable and can only be replicated inconsistently, but it makes me worry about if I just spent another $170 for a controller that will break in just a few months.  I don't know if it's just something that won't progress, and that I should ask for a replacement, or send it back leaving myself with the worst stick drifting option being my series 2. I don't know if there's even warranty for it that I have or not, and for how long if so. The stick drift has followed me on every controller since getting my first Xbox one, and I much prefer this controller to any I've had before it even if my series 2 came out the box without problems. I've had this for 2 days now, and it's difficult to replicate the left thumbstick drift, but I've found it to only occur upon moving the thumbstick down. It also seems like it could be very sensitive as the pressure from my thumb tapping it lightly might cause it from time to time, or just with it resting on the stick. If it stays this way I can definitely reccomend it, but we'll see down the line I guess.Update: The controller has a habbit of glitching out my mic and turning my voice into a glitching robot that is hard to understand at random, but frequent times. The controller rarely, but sometimes doesn't turn on when I turn my Xbox One X on. It takes a few tries of unplugging and re-plugging it into either the controller, or the Xbox itself to fix. It sometimes doesn't register presses of the under buttons, and the two extra front buttons, but it's extremely rare. All of the buttons have held up rather nicely, and the thumbsticks still have no stick drift with heavy use. The undergrip is still in mint condition. The RGB is still perfect, and I find that the paddles, except those really rare times, work perfectly with exceptional responsiveness. The biggest issue I've had so far was the mic issue. For something like Rainbow Six: Siege, this is a huge issue for me as I'll be in a ranked game and it will glitch out every once in a while every few games or so. Not even my broken Elites have done something like this. An upside is that the ever so slight stick drift is completely gone somehow. It's an exceptional controller, but the mic issue is a big new one for the games I play, so I'll have to bump the stars from 4 to 3 sadly due to my experience paying $150-$160 for this controller and having an issue like this.

  When it came in one button was a little wobbly. Couldn't figure out how to write company, controller worked thou. 5 months later it didn't.

I went with this instead of scuff cause the price and scuffs sticks go bad, but atleast they can sell you new ones, this thing breaks, just throw it away.. Looking into scuffs now, if company finally gets ahold of me after this review I will update... BUT, choose another option, this controller is the best, just cust Serv, and poor manufacturering have it moving into to 2nd or 3rd against an inferior controller that cost more, unless you want to buy 2 a year!!!.....

  I bought this controller last March, it was AMAZING. Best aftermarket controller I have used and I love, repeat LOVE the extra button placements and ability to map them to your liking, as well as have two different mapping settings that changes as easily as a single button press.HOWEVER- after about 6 months of daily use (an hour or so a day) it would randomly start disconnecting itself (it is a wired controller), everything still hooked up and it would just disconnect and you would get the message on screen “please reconnect controller”. I have tried everything I could to solve the issue, but the problem being, I has to be the cord, as my controller has always been handled and taken care of with extreme care. I reached out to the company, and unfortunately they weren’t even accepting emails.. the customer service is actually non-existent. And that’s a real bummer, and for that reason alone I will not buy another of their products, nor would I recommend their products to anyone.

",1.0,Michael,"Reviewed in the United States October 28, 2018","









  
  
    
  The Wolverine Ultimate is advertised to be Xbox and PC-compatible. It is not even remotely the latter. I purchased this to run a flightsim game on the PC and find that, by design, this device cannot be seen in the Razer Synapse software (their configuration tool) because it is apparently 'tournament certified' and thus prohibited from assigning keybinds in the manner I have come to expect from every other Razer mouse and keypad I have purchased. Keymapping is limited to shuffling the few existing keybinds it already has. This purchased needlessly wasted my time; a device crippled in this manner should be advertised as ""tournament only"" or ""limited options for non-tournament players"" rather than the misleading lable of 'Ultimate'. It has been packed up and processed as a return.Bad form Razer, I expected better from you.

  I own a Razer Wildcat and have had it for three years. After heavy use, one of the trigger stops no longer worked properly. Being that I loved that controller, I figured the Wolverine would be a great pickup.To its credit, it still is a quality controller, though I have to wonder about some design decisions. Once again the triggers and sticks feel great, however the ABXY buttons have a significantly longer travel distance compared to the wildcat, even though they have a satisfying click, they are simply harder to press. Oddly, they've gone the opposite way with the dpad buttons. They're closer to a terrible Mac butterfly keyboard than the satisfying clicky buttons on the Wildcat. The point being, on the Wildcat, the tactile feel and required pressure is the same on both the dpad and ABXY buttons but is different on the Wolverine for no reason.I could live with that if not for one fatal flaw:The wolverine has customization options, moreso than the Wildcat (which could only be customized on the controller itself which was somewhat handy), but it is NOT editable on the PC. I do not own an Xbox One so I was unable to control any of the button settings (like turning the back buttons off) or turn off the annoying LED's unless I was able to use an Xbox One. For a $100 controller this seems a real insult to someone that has owned multiple Razer products to not be able to customize it from any of the Razer PC Apps, especially since they have created an app.... just for the xbox. For that reason I returned the product and will continue to use my Wildcat.

  This is an amazing controller and it has taken the lime light away from my keyboard for most games. I'm a casual gamer and recently this controller has allowed me to sit back on my couch and play my PC with the relaxation of playing a console. Sitting up next to the monitor and playing with my keyboard gives me a competitive edge when I want it but for most times the controller is very nice and is automatically detected. My biggest problem is that it doesn't work with Razer Synapse for Chroma effects.

  When I first got this controller I was absolutely blown out of the water and I loved every bit of it, but now that I’ve had it for just  over a month I’m very disappointed. All of the buttons are clicky and fast to react but just a few days ago I picked it up and pressed the X button and it barely clicks anymore and feels like it’s completely lost all of its springiness, not to mention I’ll have to press it 2-3 times to even get it to register. Normally if I had a controller that did this I would just blame it on wear but considering the fact that I spent $140 on this and have had it for about 32 days it’s absolutely mind boggling that the X button already broke.

  So I already own an Elite Series 2. This new Razer Wolverine 2 is not that, but it does compare favorably in a few key areas.I purchased this for $80 instead of the usual $100, and that seems about right. If you can find it even cheaper, then this becomes almost a must buy.The negatives out of the way. It's wired. This cannot be used in a wireless setting, and if it could then this might be even better than the Elite. Now I obviously knew going in that it was wired, and that's not a deal breaker when using at my PC (which is where I'm using it), but this is a total no-go for my XBox with that setup. If having a wireless controller is important, then pass on this guy. I'm also not a fan of the extra buttons on the trigger. In theory I'm a fan, just not of their placement. They just don't seem practical or easy to use. I'm sure others don't have an issue with their placement, but it's awkward. With that said, I've never been much on using extra buttons, even the extra paddles on the elite, so this will vary based on the user.The Pros:The buttons. Oh the mechanical switches on these guys. It does take a minute to get used to, but one you do, it just feels so much better to use. It's hard to explain, but if you've used a mechanical keyboard, then you'll understand. Yes, they make a difference.The build quality. The feel of this guy in the hand is legit. I'm not going to say it feels better to hold than the Elite, but it's on par with it. The thumb-sticks, the triggers, the texture of handles in your hand. The whole package just screams quality and is a pleasure to use.I will say the placement of the menu buttons is odd and different. Not a negative, but if you switch between this guy and a regular XBox controller, it will take a minute for the brain to remember the placement when you at first switch back an forth.If you don't mind a wired controller or the lack of the back paddles and want that elite feel then this is a no brainier if you can find it around $70-$80.

  Controller is great! I’ve been using it every day for the last 8months and the hair trigger options really improve my Rainbow 6 skills.

    Scuf vs. Razer (Tournament Edition)
  
",4.0,Ryan Kemper,"Reviewed in the United States October 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  Overall a very great controller. I have owned a scuf vantage and I can say that this performs up to the same standard. The layout of the remappable buttons has worked out really well for shooters and Rocket League. The top remappable buttons have a mouse click feel and sound to them and the back paddles are more muted and have a soft button press. The D-pad buttons and the ABXY buttons have a similar mouse click feeling and sound as well. There are trigger stops that are able to be toggled on or off but I don't think I have ever toggled it off. The shortened trigger pull feels much better and seems to give a slight edge in reaction time. I have heard some people say that in intense games they have pulled past the trigger stop but I have yet to have this happen to me. The back handles of the controller are covered in rubber and do a really good job of keeping it in my hands and not slipping when adjusting my grip. Near the top where the Xbox button is located there is a line that fades left to right with RGB lighting fairly quickly that looks really nice and is surprisingly bright but not overpowering. The LB and RB buttons are fairly standard and work as they should. There is a 3.5mm audio jack at the bottom of the controller that will allow you to use a wired headset. The sticks are slightly concaved with nice grip. If you like to use Kontrol freeks you will have to sacrifice the outer layer of rubber on the thumb sticks because they are to large and will not fit. I forced the kontrol freeks through the rubber layer and they have not given me any issues. I have used this on both Xbox one and PC and it has worked well on both. The cable included is long enough to be used while sitting on the couch away from your system and it is also braided and very durable. I have used this controller exclusively for 8 months now and none of the components have become sticky or have stopped working. Both sticks still do not have any idle drift in game. I'm overall very happy with it and will likely purchase another if this one ever stops working.

  I love all of my Razer products! I wish this one worked with the PC synapse, but you are able to download the Xbox version on your PC to change the colors, lighting patterns and set the programmable buttons. I love the feel of the buttons. The the A,B,X,Y buttons push like mouse buttons. Please be aware this controller is NOT wireless. It always needs to be plugged in. But to make up for that Razer gives you a pretty generous amount of cable. Also you do need to be careful on how much stress you put on the cable. The cable that comes with it is pretty much the only cable that will plug into the controller.

  This is the best controller I have ever owned, but it is also the most expensive. It seems nice and sturdy, comes with a good case, and replaceable D-pads and analog sticks. I bought it reluctantly because I was sick of replacing cheap controllers and was curious if the premium product would be any different.Obviously, since it is razer, it glows and whatnot if you are into that sort of thing.I never knew I would find the additional buttons so handy, especially with games requiring you to hold down a button while sprinting. The additional buttons act as duplicates that can be controlled with your index fingers allowing better simultaneous control with the analog sticks.So far, I am happy with it, provided that it continues to function properly for some time.

  **Had for 7 monthsI bought this instead of the Microsoft Elite Controller thinking I would like it more since I have not experienced any issues with the mice I've bought from Razer. When it worked, the most annoying thing was the USB cable, it tended to get loose from the controller frequently, not sure if that is the port or the cable.Didn't try out the extra joysticks, though I did switch out the D Pads and didn't have much of a preference since I wasn't playing any fighting games. I didn't use the extra mapping buttons either, just never decided what to use them for. The controller definitely feels great and enjoyed it while it lasted. I turned off the Chroma as I just found it distracting and kinda annoying when it would light up the room more than the light from the TV.Though today the left trigger has receded and I've been unable to get it back out. Will try Razer to see if they will honor their warranty. Though based off my experience would probably go with the Elite controller.

  TL;DR: Came from an Elite Controller, Hated the break-in period, but ended up being very satisfied with a quality product.Getting used to this controller takes a minute and will make you question why you even bought the controller to begin with.But then suddenly you adapt and it’s the best controller you’ve used to date.Coming from an elite controller, I didn’t like the paddle positioning on the Wolverine at first. But I too got used to this, and actually prefer it over the elite’s paddle locations. Purely because now I don’t accidentally squeeze my controller and hit one of the paddles mid firefight. With the elite, I could only use two paddles at a time for this reason. No such issue with the Wolverine.Extra bumper buttons are awesome and extremely useful. nuff saidTrigger stops are good, but after smashing on the left trigger when ADSing since purchase, I can feel a little more give in the left trigger over the right with the stops in-use. No difference when the stops aren’t used.Buttons are responsive, with a cleaner feeling action than the OEM controllers.Grips are grippy and this is huge... THEY DONT MELT OFF *ahem*ELITE CONTROLLER*ahem*RGB lights are fun and customizable, which helps with identifying which preset you’re on.

  I am a huge fan of Razer products, just about every peripheral for my gaming rig is Razer, so i had high expectations for this controller.  I bought 2, 1 for my Xbox and 1 for my PC.  My main issue is with the software and key mapping, i cant believe there is no true custom mapping abilities or special functions like you get with the Xbox Elite controller.  The mapping for the PC is the same as for the Xbox, even though on a PC you need to be able to map more keys, or combinations of keys.  I thought i would be able to do multiple key functions on the same bind, for example to lean right or left in a game i am playing i have to hold a modifier key.  I wanted to be able to map that to a single key, but the software is so minimal and basic its not possible.  I am debating sending both controllers back, because i expected more, much more from Razer.

  Latest update overdue:. Razor did honor the warranty after some back and forth. I am not happy with the process but they deserve some credit for fixing the issue.Older review below lineBeware of warranty claims.  Apparently Razer support is giving me the run around because I bought this on Amazon.  It was even tagged as ""Amazon's Choice"".  Apparently the seller was electronics101deals and Razer claims they are not an authorized reseller.  I am currently a week into trying to figure out how to replace my controller after support has confirmed a hardware issue.  My left thumb-stick does not register up so its hard to move in  FPS.  I will keep this updated.  I left my original review below.-----------------------------Previous Headline: Great alternative to the elite controllerThis review is for the tournament edition, ultimate has several other features.I have been using this controller for several months and would recommend it for anyone looking to add back buttons or would like a better feeling controller with the face buttons (x, y, a, b).  I play a lot of FPS games where you either need extra buttons on the rear or you have to learn how to do the claw grip to compete with online players at a high level.  Previously I was using an elite, which I loved until it recently broke.  I decided to give this controller a shot based on two factors.  First the warranty was  a full year unlike the 90 days you get with the elite.  Secondly it was much cheaper than replacing the elite.  I would buy again and would recommend to fellow gamers.Pros:- Lower price point than elite or scuf- Face buttons feel great (like mechanical keyboard)- M1 and M2 buttons are actually very convenient- Chroma lighting is cool but mainly for easily telling what profile you have active- Software to remap loads fast and is very easy to useCons:- The back buttons are better than Scuf but not as easy as elite (personal preference mostly)- Wired only (should be for competitive anyway)- Non replaceable thumb-sticks (one size fits all here)- Software can ONLY remap M1, M2, M3, M4 buttons (standard buttons are not configurable)- Have to switch profiles via the app (its super fast though)

  first off this product is not compatible with the razer synapse program, you have this a program called ""wolverine for xbox"" which is a direct port of the xbox program, they didn't program it to respond to mouse and keyboard, really lazy programming.Then for the real kicker, when you get into the program you realize you can only remap the buttons to other buttons on the controller or 2 of the controllers special functions.which means the extra buttons are useless for pc players.Worse part this controller has been out for years and they have not fixed the software.yes in mine opinion(and everyone elses except razor) the software is a broken port of the xbox software, it is in no way is a windows program other than it runs on it.this is my last razer purchase.

  Hands down the best Xbox controllerI've put a lot of hours in on this device (nearly 500 so far), and I have had ZERO issues with functionality.  There's no stick drift, and the buttons remain just as functional as they were out of the package.  I understand where some people would have issues with not having a wireless controller, but being wired is the only downside.  The cable is braided and break-away though, but you will never have to worry about the port where it plugs into the controller breaking over time because of the stability in the design.  If you're sick consistently buying new controllers because the old one has worn out or drifts to the point where you can't even select anything efficiently, then buy this controller.  It's worth it.

  The controller itself is well made and responsive, but the wire for the controller is poorly made and didn't last 6 months. The wire is a micro USB so I picked up a new one from the local store only to find it didn't fit. Razer decided to cut grooves into the port so that only their cord would fit in. Yeah they'll probably tell you it's to help the cord fit snugger, and maybe that was the intention, but it seems super shady. It's even worse that researching for replacement cords leads you to some forums where others have complained and no one has been able to find a replacement. So they made a terrible cheap cord for a $150+ controller that cannot be replaced and doesn't last more than 6 months. Yeah, I won't be buying any more Razer products.I did finally find a 'solution' to the replacement cord. I took a drill to the inner mold where the cord attaches and carved out the plastic grooves preventing any non-Razer branded replacement cord and then was able to install a better made cord and not buy an entirely new controller.

  What can I say? Holy crap!! I have the $149 X-Box Elite controller - so I got this for my gaming desktop because when I got my X-Box One X i moved my S to my gaming monitor and desktop setup. Wow. Okay - it's wired - I hate that - but now I know why. The response is extremely noticeable compared to the Elite. Buttons have a more tactile feel. My only complaint is that with the extra swappable pieces you don't get matching sets so it's mismatched. What were they thinking? Otherwise, excellent case, light in your hands and solid built quality and the lighting is cool. Another great Razer product. Docked a star only because of not giving set pieces for stick replacements which make it feel off using anything other than stock.

  This controller feels great. The buttons are supper responsive and the added option of swapping d-pad and analogs is a great, 6 mappable buttons witch is wonderful especially for shooters never having to take your thumb off to reload or jump. Also the RGB strip is customizable witch is another bonus. Rubber grips on  the backs for you swet moments what's not to love. I went with this controller cause I had a standard xbox controller with a panel pack for the back panel buttons and it was time to upgrade. But I only use wired don't like battery's specially when I game for 14 hours+ and the mic and game mixer for audio was also a sell cause on my other controller i used a turtle beach controller adapter. It also goes great with my Razer Kraken Tourmant edition headphones so yep lol. This is a buy in my book.

  My issue with the controller was the the paddles location isn't in the greatest spot but manageable and I have medium/small hands so it's not that bad but I have to use my ring fingers to maintain my grip otherwise. It's tough to explain so my solution was I made both button on one side jump so no matter which one I press or accidentally fly hit I'll hit the one I want regardless of grip or panic press.Another thing I'd like to touch on which is a big plus and almost nobody ever reviews for  talk about is the stick resistance and how it feels amazing. best way I can put it is it feels like the ps4 resistance. In my opinion playstation did it right and this controller has about the same. There is no wiggle or jiggle room what so ever. The mm you move it will move in game. when using it so no dead zone if you will compared to license xbox controllers that have wiggle room both gens for the Elite controller have the wiggle problem and maybe other third parties companies. Power does a good job too.I primarily bought it for pc but I have an xbox as well. The buttons feels great and very tactile and responsive. Zero issues. The trigger stops work as I'd expected with not a lot of travel distance when switched on. Switched off feels typical and responsive. The two extra buttons by the bumpers I'm stil getting use to but I do accidentally hit them sometimes however I was using the controller for the first but time and used it for 8 hours and just a slight adaptability that needs to happen.. the cord is more than long enough and I preferred wired anyways so plus for me.The xbox app has 1.5 stars on windows store and xbox store. People were having profile issues but if you play only FPS or that's your primary then I wouldn't worry about as you can physically set the buttons without the software.So because of the crappy app and the location of the rear buttons it loses a star but regardless I would still buy this again and recommend over any controller for xbox or pc. Every button press feels like a mouse click so if you're looking for a controller buy this one. I'm not a razer fan what so ever but this is 100% worth it.

  Update: We’ve had the controller for a year and it has completely stopped working. According to Reddit, this is a common issue after this time frame. Very disappointing for the amount of money paid for this controller. It should last long than a year. I wouldn’t recommend this product. We have old Scufs that still work on the 360. Buy Scuf instead, if you can. It’ll at least last.My boyfriend LOVES this controller. It is a great alternative to a SCUF, and there are many features he liked more than a SCUF, such as the trigger stops that are controlled by a switch. The only downside was that a month or so after getting it the ""A"" paddle on the back has to be pressed hard for it to work. Pressing lightly wouldn't do anything, while the other one worked fine. That's the only reason I've given it 4/5 stars. He was worried about it being wired, but the card is so long you honestly don't even notice it! And you don't have to worry about batteries! Overall, we enjoy this controller, it was just a little disappointing that one of the paddles wore out so quickly.

  My boyfriend had always wanted an Xbox controller with the back paddles, so I got him this one as a gift. I thought it was cooler and seemed like better quality than the Xbox Elite controllers, and not to mention cheaper too!  When it came, I took it out of the box just to check it out before giving it to him, and I was honestly so impressed with it. It’s sturdy, the buttons click instead of a press, which makes it easier to click them faster over and over again. The joy sticks are sturdy as well, and come with two different ones, which is good Incase one breaks. And it comes with a nice case!  And furthermore, my boyfriend lovessss this controller. He says it helps him play better, and he loves everything about the controller. So coming from a person who didn’t use the controller, and a person who does use the controller: we both give it a 10/10 highly recommend.

  Lets get this out of the way, This should be Good for Xbox users as they generally dont allow you do map different buttons that arent already present, but for PC gaming you're better off getting a steam controller.Build quality seems VERY good, one of the reasons i bought this was because it looks sturdy, and the cable retainer looked like it would prevent damage to the port  if dropped/tugged the ABXY buttons are a bit hard to press compared to my XbOne comtroller and the amazon basic controller i already have, other than that all buttons have a satisfying mostly linear resistance and click/breakUsability, basically an Xbox Elite controller(never use personally) I was hoping that with this supporting PC i could re-map the programmable buttons to different key strokes, or at least a combination of xbox button presses as most games will let you map button combinations. But no, you're limited to a single key bind, of only the existing xbox buttonsAdvertizing : calling this re-mappable is quite a large overstatement, though i dont know what to call it otherwise, i guess swappable/clone-able would be more approprate, as the only mapping that is allowed, are buttons already present elsewhere on the Xbox standard controller so you're just duplicating a buttonSide note: If you've been having issues with the Xbox button not working in windows on a standard XBox controller, it seems to work reliably on this one

",5.0,Jordan,"Reviewed in the United States May 23, 2018","









  
  
    
  I waited a couple of weeks after I purchased this controller so it would give me time to get used to it and break it in. Im a previous owner of an Elite controller. Actually 3 Elite controllers because they kept breaking on me. I buy/sell very expensive camera regularly and if you know anything about high end camera gear then the inspecting process is as tedious as it gets. A spec of dust can make or break a sale for a $2,000 lens. Needless to say, I take exceptional care of all my electronics the same way i would my camera gear which is why Im absolutely amazed that all 3 of my elite controllers had defects after rather light usage. After my 3rd Elite break, I decided to opt for the return and get the Razor Wolverine Ultimate instead. I usually go for name brands and the most quality of any product I get but in this case the Elite had failed me.Ive, had this controller for 2 weeks and it feels very well built although not as premium as the Elite feels but still very nice. However, the buttons and joysticks feel much more sturdy and well built compared to the elite controller. Thats where it counts. Aside from the durability, the usability of the Razer blows the Elite out of the water! The 2 extra buttons by the RB and LB buttons are much more useful than any of the paddle add-ons on the Elite controller. Also the 4 add-on buttons under the controller are much more convenient than the Elites paddles also. You can still grip the controller tightly and not accidentally press them like you would with the Elite. The micro and macro movement feature is just a bonus that takes the controller on that much higher a level at this point. I also love the click style of the A,X,Y,B buttons. Every controller brand should adapt this feature.My only negative about the controller is the cord length. Its only about 10 feet long while my xbox is 14 feet away from my tv. A male to Female USB extension fixes this problem but then it renders the quick connect useless if someone were to trip over the cord and pull on the xbox. This controller is not perfect but its the best on the market at the moment so im leaving 5 stars.I am very happy I made this purchase and won't be going back to the elite even if they update it. I will be buying more Razer products from now on.

The trigger locks allow for rapid trigger manipulation which is vital in pvp fps were thousandths of a second matter. The additional four buttons, which are programmed by default as X, Y, A, and B, are very convenient as, once you learn how to effectively utilize them, you will seldom need to remove your thumb from the right control stick. The construction feels solid, what I expect from Razer. I know that some people complain about it not being wireless. However, they are aware of that fact prior to purchase, and shouldn't have purchased it in the first place. I prefer wired controllers, and most hardcore gamers that I know prefer them as well. I don't like to bother with charging my remotes, especially during prolonged gaming sessions. The only reason that I'm deducting a star is because this remote is dependent upon ""synapse for xbox"". That means that it doesn't synchronize with your other razer synapse peripherals. It isn't a deal-breaker. But, it is a little disappointing that they don't have a separate driver that PC users can utilize to allow this remote to synchronize with Synapse for PC.

  Start and RB are tied together, not programmed, after a month of use.

  The product software cant be installed and doesn't actually even worth for this product...only figured that out by googling and seeing the copious amount of disappointed customers. Pulling the right trigger sometimes will activate the triangle button for some reason. Cant update drives to see if that will fix it because...you cant install software for it and device manager says the drivers are updates. Big Yikes.

    Razer has officially lost all of my trust and respect. Don't make my mistake and buy.
  
",2.0,Ryan,"Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2021","









  
  
    
  Honestly, the issues with this controller are  so comically sad.... I dont even know what to say. Every single problem this controller has makes it extremely obvious that Razer has apparently laid off their entire QA team I guess? Every single issue should have been noticed within the first 10 minutes of any product testing, so I have to assume they didn't do any. Worse part? Amazon is allowing them to get away with selling this horrible controller because it is looping the reviews from previous controllers in with it. I just hope some people can see this before wasting $100.Okay, here we go....First off, as others have said everywhere, if you press either of the bumper buttons and then try to  press the triggers, you have to force the plastic ont he trigger past the bumper button plastic making an audible click that will surely degrade the controller after a while and already makes it horrible. The trigger will also stay depressed if you are still holding the bumper when letting go..... which can ruin your play in a large number of games.Second, the right trigger already started sticking on god knows what when depressed after 48 hours of ownership.... and then eventually a snap was heard on the hair trigger crap and has broken it further.I can't imagine what else will go wrong... I am so upset because Razer used to be the company I could trust in a see of third party trash. Now? They are literally worse than the random unlicensed controllers on here. At least they only charge you $20-$30 for their controller that will break in less than a week.Worst part for me? The box was trashed by mistake so now I can't even return this horrible controller. Instead, I will place it somewhere it constantly reminds me to never even buy a Razer product ever again, which is really sad because I loved them.I can honestly say now, however, that Power-A has surpassed them in quality.... shudder...I  would go through the pros and good parts but the negatives are so bad it doesn't matter. It is completely unusable. Razer support wont help either because I was advised the clicking and breaking the triggers make is a feature not a bug so.... grift away Razer. You will lose far more in future revenue than you have grifted from me here.

  Ordered this for myself as a late X-mas gift, and as an end to 2020 gift, because we all need one of those. Came in quickly and I was super pumped, so as I got to setting it up, It all looked okay until I got to the box itself, I don't know how else to describe it other than the packaging being loose. Unusual for Razer products. Well as I took off the paper, lo and behold, the seal that closed the box appeared to have been tampered with.  Once I got inside I found of all things.. a Used Controller! It was pretty well worn and dusty, and even the connector cable was pretty dinged up. I'm rather upset as this controller wasn't cheap. Started the return process with Amazon and I will update if things are corrected. CHECK YOUR STUFF FOLKS!

    Great controller, lots of options, wish it had a better headphone connection
  
",4.0,Tek,"Reviewed in the United States December 25, 2019","









  
  
    
  All around good controller, does everything you want it to.  The cable includes a “trip disconnect” inline, to theoretically prevent anyone from pulling your console off the shelf if they trip over the cable.  I suppose the obvious ask here would be to have a wireless version of this thing.  Thankfully we have not had to test this trip disconnect thing.Anyway, the headphone jack leaves MUCH to be desired.  First and foremost, it comes out the bottom.  Why?  There’s already a cable required at the top, why not have the headphone jack next to the console cable?  That would be a no-brainer.  But for some reason, Razer went with the no-thought-required bottom headphone jack.  Seriously guys, you’re a high-end gaming controller manufacturer...  this is a stupidly simple thing to think about.  Especially with the extended button panel on that bottom edge, it makes the headphone jack cable stick out.So yeah...  nice controller, just be careful with the headphone jack.

",4.0,Jordan M. Miller,"Reviewed in the United States July 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  This controller has more pros than cons and while not perfect, it's superior in both ergonomics and build quality to Microsoft's Elite controller.Pros:1) It's comfortable. The grips are angled slightly inward and there is less reach for triggers.2) The buttons are tactile and feel mechanical, not spongy.3) The back triggers are actually comfortable and functional, unlike the removable triggers on the Elite controller.4) It's programmable and has swappable joysticks with different heights5) While it's not USB C, the micro USB has a small housing around it that makes it easy to connect.Cons:1) The top of the grips are smooth plastic, which leads to sweaty hands vs the Elite's soft touch grips.2) The power cable is heavy.The fact this controller is wired, is not a con. Most buyers should know this going in. It's worth the money, especially if you have experienced joystick drift 8 months into an Elite controller.

  Read this if you're on the fence about buying the Wolverine controller.BUY ITI've spent the majority of my life playing video games. I first started on the SNES and as I got older, I progressed into the more competitive FPS games. I've been playing online games since Halo 2 and I'm still an active FPS, PvP type gamer.Why does any of this matter for a review?It comes down to this - I've spent a lot of my life with a controller in my hands, and this is by far the most innovative and easy-to-use controller I've ever owned.The ability to change my sensitivity while in a firefight is INSANE. I don't typically use this feature, but I definitely understand the potential use. The best thing about this controller are the two extra buttons behind the bumpers you can map. I'm currently playing Destiny 2 and I can jump, slide/crouch, switch weapons, reload, access my quests AND my inventory without ever having to take my thumbs off of the analog sticks. WHAT! I know, it's crazy. Speaking of the analog sticks, they are extremely easy to swap out. I used to play with Kontrolfreeks but I feel like Razer just got these bad boys right. Feels very natural. The mic controls on the bottom are super helpful to change audio level on-the-fly. Not to mention there's also an app you can download to the Xbox to adjust built in sensitivity, dead zone, color scheme, etc. I've been using it daily for about 3 months, and honestly it was one of the best gifts I've ever received.100% buy this if your'e considering it. Great for serious players who really like to get sweaty and also casual players who like ease of use and customization. Thank me later

  This is definitely the best controller I've ever had. I've been gaming on pretty much every system imaginable since the 90s and this one is my favorite by far. Very comfortable especially for long gaming sessions. The paddles on the back are easy to use yet out of the way if you don't want to use them all the time. They don't accidentally press when you set the controller down either. Trigger switches are responsive. The additional shoulder buttons are easy to press and provide a mouse-like click when pressed. The software is simple yet intuitive. The face buttons are mechanical and provide a satisfying click when pressed with responsive actuation. RGB lighting is sweet. The joystick grips work really well even if you're like me and have sweaty hands. I would definitely buy another one of these if they ever come out with a wireless model, though it is nice to not have to deal with batteries. I have the standard Xbox one controller, the elite, elite V2, and this one and I'd definitely say this is the best one by far. Completely worth the cost, the build quality is fantastic.

    HONEST REVIEW
  
",4.0,Nathaniel Harris,"Reviewed in the United States April 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  I was trying to decide between this and the Elite so I bought both. I love almost everything about the controller. THE EXTRA TWO BUTTONS NEXT TO THR TRIGGERS ARE AMAZING (M1, M2) but with that being said the lower paddles are just not positioned in a comfortable place to me. The ones above it (M3,M4) are reachable for most but I don’t know anybody who likes the lower two (M5, M6). The controller is super light (even lighter than the stock Xbox One) the buttons for the mic and remapping are amazing as well. I love all the features it offers but I can’t go over all of them. My biggest issues with the controller is having to unplug it and re-plug it for it to work sometimes and the thumb sticks on it are really responsive but I play a lot of FPS games and the thumb stick pads are pretty fat. It messed up my aim in a few games and I was never able to adjust to it and I used the controller for about 80+ hours easily. The cord comes with a wrap for the extra cord you don’t use which was very nice. One thing I didn’t think I would like a lot but I did was the Color options for the light on the controller. I still have it but I use the Elite. If you can get use to the thumb sticks and they are comfortable for you this controller is easily the best one out there. I just crossed the Scuf out in my mind, they are never available

",2.0,Andrew,"Reviewed in the United States September 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  TLDR: Doesn't seem worth the extra $ over a baseline controller. It still broke after 5 months.In general it works fine, feels good, and does the things you would expect.Initially when I started using it I the buttons seemed to have more resistance to the press, and things just seemed to have a rigidity to them. On the whole this makes it feel more rugged and your actions feel very intentional, in practice it seems to be about the same. The grip also feels slightly different than a standard Xbox controller, I had to adjust my grip a bit. It took a week or so to get used to the differences, the feel was noticeably different.I haven't found a use for the back paddles, and it seems they can only mirror existing buttons, so it seems you can't really use it as a separate, standalone function button, it just copies one of your other buttons. Admittedly I might've just not set it up properly.The controller kinda bugs out the USB port somehow occasionally. I've had a few weird things happen: The controller will be black/dead and you have to unplug the cable and plug it back in to get it to kinda wake up. I've also had it bug out my keyboard and mouse, where both go black along with the controller and unplugging the controller brings the other USB stuff back... So yeah, weird, but only seems to happen after waking the computer up, not sporadically, so it's not been a big problem.So I bought this controller around 5 months ago. The bumper just crapped out on me. It's kinda stuck in and feels all mushed, won't click anymore... I've had the same bumper break on previous controllers. I bought this controller hoping the higher price would come with a higher build quality but apparently the bumpers still crap out around the same time. Yeah I dunno, I guess I'm death gripping the thing. The extra button resistance mentioned above maybe isn't helping.I play a lot of rocket league and I have boost set to right bumper so I'm hitting it very often and holding it down a lot of the time, so apparently the bumper just isn't made to hold up to that much use. I think I'm better off buying two cheaper controllers for half the price since they crap out around the same time anyway and the extra features didn't actually seem to do anything for me.Looks like I have a use for the back paddles now aye? -.-*

    Bad Trigger Placement
  
",2.0,DeeJay,"Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2018","









  
  
    
  - Pros-The buttons on the controller are NOT like most controllers. These buttons click like a mouse. It will take a few matches of your favorite game to get used to them but it will grow on you.- The controller is sturdy and well made. I dont feel like it's going to break anytime soon.-ConsI really wanted to love this controller, but unfortunately, I do not. The (6) re-mappable triggers are very hard to reach. I purchased this controller specifically for the triggers on the back of the controller. I play a lot of Overwatch and FPS (on Xbox) where taking your hands off the controller at the wrong time will cause you to die. If you're looking at buying this controller for the re-mappable triggers, do yourself a favor and look elsewhere.  I'm 6ft 2in, 250lbs with very large hands. You're gonna have to trust me when I tell you that I have the hardest times using the triggers. In fact, I no longer try to use them at all. It's not worth it.-The 4 triggers on the back of the device are placed terribly. 2 of the 4 triggers arent really triggers, but are more like half triggers. They do serve some kind of purpose according to the instructions, but they are too small to even bother using.The other two triggers are located so far down on the controller that you have to stretch your middle fingers to get to them which then makes holding the controller not comfortable.-If you're going to use any of the triggers, I recommend using the two on the top.  You will also have trouble getting to those comfortably as well, but its not as awkward as trying to use the ones on the back.- You cannot buy additional interchangable Dpads and thumbsticks. This might not seem like a bad thing since they do give you 3 thumbsticks and 2 interchangable Dpads but if you want to do any other kind of combination (specifically with the thumbsticks), you're out of luck.OverallI would not purchase this controller due to the bad trigger placement. If you can live with a basic version of this controller, I'd check out the Razer Wolverine Tournament Edition with 4 remappable buttons. On THAT controller, the 2 triggers that are built on the back are built onto the grips of the controller which is way easier and natural to get to. (Imagine where your middle fingers normally rest on the back of a normal controller. On the Tournament edition of the controller, the triggers are built there. Makes sense right?)

    ended up bruising my middle finger
  
",3.0,phillip,"Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  Decided to try out the razer wolverine because my scuf 4ps pro was falling apart. (tactical spring cancelling and right paddle wasn't working).  I use these controllers to play COD on PC so it doesn't matter whether I use a ps4 controller or one built for xbox.In terms of comparing this controller to a standard sony ps4 or scuf 4ps pro controller.  The controller is big, hefty to hold, definitely  a lot bigger than your ps4 controller. I would assume an xbox controller is about the same size if not bigger. Overall I really liked the controller in terms of what it was capable of doing however the button placement was off for me and don't see how anyone can get use to that type of layout.  For reference, i wear size medium biking gloves.  I also had a scuf impact and Vantage and didn't like the feel of those controllers, although i could hold it and reach every button pretty comfortably.The pros of the controller for me was:- 2 back buttons in one row, pretty efficient and ease of use and reach, however it is a little farther towards the center so if you have smaller size hands definitely wouldn't find the controller comfortable.- was easy to customize the button layout on pc with the xbox razer app for windows- adjustable hair triggers, probably better than the adjustable hair triggers on the scuf- clicky right 4 buttons, anytime you can get a mouse click type of button get it, definitely better for FPS games.The cons:- The main discomfort i noticed right off the bat was the bumpers are oddly placed. It felt unnatural going from the trigger buttons to the bumper buttons.  The movement was so off that i find myself not being able to aim correctly when using my tactical equipment.- The trigger buttons are oddly shaped and pop out at an angle, the way its shaped makes you hold the controller in a certain way which makes it harder to access the bumper buttons, again it might just be me coming from a ps4 controller to an xbox style controller- the M1 button which is the left middle button next to LB and LT is oddly place where I would accidentally hit that button, i ended up disabling  it.- Now the biggest con for me and why i decided to return this was, the back top trigger button was causing my left middle finger to become bruise.  The way the backside of the controller pops out it didn't allow my middle finger to rest comfortable on that button.  To better describe it, it was as if my finger was resting over a bump to press that button.  However, the right side was perfectly fine, I would assume that my left hand position is different from the right as the analog stick is higher up VS on the right side where the analog stick is on the bottom section of the controller.  I really tried to make the controller work, tried holding different positions, tried using the bumpers as my trigger buttons, tried using the M1 and M2 middle clicky buttons as trigger buttons, but no matter how I held the controller my left middle finger would end up hurting.Overall, I liked the controller, I think it would have been the perfect controller if it was a tad bit smaller and where  the back side didn't pop out so much, it was hard to find a comfortable position to hold the controller. really wanted to make this work as I am a big fanboy for razer products. Razer headset keyboard mouse etc really wanted to match the controller as well. Might give the Raiju ultimate a try but seeing how the controller seems very closely built to the wolverine I'll probably pass.I tried a lot of high end controllers overall,  for me the best feeling is still the standard sony dual shock size controller.  I do agree that the left analog stick is actually more comfortable higher up however, the sacrifice is that the controllers are usually always bigger therefore a lot less comfortable in my case.  If Razer would build a controller based on the sony dual shocks i'd be all over it in a heartbeat.

    Better Than Elite if you Don't Mind the Wire
  
",5.0,Eric Hochuli,"Reviewed in the United States October 8, 2018","









  
  
    
  After using a second hand elite for about 6 months and it predictably started to fall apart, I began to look for a better option with the same premium feel.This was really the only reasonable option since I play on PC and don't mind the wire.PROS:- great feel in your hand, well built.- buttons have a clicky mechanical feel, I could never go back to the regular sponge-like ones on the elite.- decent sticks, I am not a fan of concave thumb pads, but these are the best I have used. I have ordered some short convex grips from Kontrol Freek. Xbox 360 ones seem to fit.-Wire connection is really secure. I found the elite wire falling out after 3 months of use and had to replace it. This wire is supported with a socket that holds the connection tight. Awesome design.-Pretty seamless functionality with PC.CONS:-Razer synapse for xbox is trash, freezes and crashes all the time. Fortunately you don't have to use it often or leave it running. Can't be too mad, because all of the software made by hardware companies is garbage... NZXT, EVGA, MSI, Gigabyte... none of them can do it right, except for Logitech too bad their controller is from 1997.-Paddle buttons are easy to hit on accident. But it is probably just because I am not used to them.-Lighter weight, which could make some feel it is of a lower quality than the elite.Overall, a better user experience than the Elite with a better warranty for 30 less bucks. Easy choice for PC users who play wired.

  So they make a great controller and advertise all these features, but downplay none of them being accessible on PC in whats adds up to misleading advertisement, but its made for ""windows 10"". Its a collaboration between razer and Microsoft not to do PC software to force people to buy XBOX consoles, when PCs could be same and better. Don't get me wrong, if you just want a plain old controller that works great as-is, this is it for PC if you like xbox style layout. But if you are buying it for colors, remapping, forget it for PC as that only works on the xbox console. Razer is a piece of crap company who makes a good re-mapper for keyboards, mice, and even the mats the keyboards and mice sit on, but NOTHING for their ""PC"" controller. Insane and they deserve no credit for this alliance with Microsoft. How can it not be some backroom deal as they can remap everything else they make?

  This tournament edition controller did not impress me as much as I was expecting. As I am a huge fan and supporter of Razer products. This purchase was for use on a Windows PC only. The two main reasons I had opted for this particular controller over others had let me down. First it was for the remapping of a few buttons. These are very limited as what you can with them. As a Razer product I was assuming it would be more similar remapping/programming as their keyboards and mice. It is not at all like that. The second main reason for this purchase is for the Chroma lighting. As I have a Razer mouse and keyboard with that lighting and also my case has lighting. Was assuming this Chroma controller would work in conjunction with the other products using their Razer Synapse software.  This is not the case. You will need to install an app from the Microsoft store to adjust/control the lighting as well as any remapping of the buttons.As the controller itself it feels fantastic and solid. It is very comfortable and the added paddle buttons on the bottom are fantastic. There is a bit of weight to this controller and I actually like that.Though I deem this controller as satisfactory, I would not make this purchase again. Also I am extremely happy that I did not opt for the more expensive ultimate edition.As with all reviews this is my opinion and yours may vary.

  Honestly I'll keep it real with you guys. This is the best controller I've ever used. I've owned both scuf and the series 2 elite controller and both of them cannot compete with this bad boy.In terms of quality I'll have to give that to the Wolverine. Usually the thumbsticks on pro controllers go out and to this day I've experienced no stick drift what so ever.The buttons feel like mouse clicks making everything feel super responsive which is awesome.The extra buttons come with a learning curve but after playing with them for about a week you'll get the hang of it and you'll notice yourself playing better.I've used this controller on both xbox and pc and I've had no issues so far. Looking forward to moving onto the new Blackops from MW with this controller, it's gonna be awesome.The only con I can really think of is that the controllers case is a bit flimsy when compared to the elite series 2, and it's wired only but if you can get over those two things, this is the controller for you.

    Good controller that falls short of being great
  
",3.0,Ryan,"Reviewed in the United States October 20, 2019","









  
  
    
  Razer comes out with another good product that falls short of being great. There are a lot of great things about this controller but for the price, it still leaves much to be desired.Pros:It’s packaging, like all Razer products, is top-notch and feels luxurious. The power cord is long and high-quality which features a cool break-away feature so you do not rip the cord out of the controller or Xbox. The mechanical “click” of all the buttons is very satisfying, along with the overall feel and built quality. The built-in audio control is nice along with the button mapping profile selection with color. The additional top buttons inside the bumpers and triggers is a really awesome addition and they work really well. The Razer Synapse software is user friendly and allows you to customize the button mapping, vibration strength, LED lighting, thumb stick “agile” and “focus” along with create additional profiles.Cons:Personally, I find the back buttons/paddles a little hard to reach while keeping your fingers on the triggers and thumb sticks. They could have been a little more to the outside of the controller which would have improved overs accessibility. The cool feature of being able to set you thumb stick sensitivity with “agile” and “focus” is negated when you do not have them mapped to buttons on the controller which to me is dumb. Why offer sensitivity adjustment when you can’t use it. Lastly, after just one weeks use in fps, the right trigger was sticking because of the bumper/trigger design. The triggers have little lips the go over the bumper and if not aligned cause the trigger to stick. I use the bumpers, not the triggers, to aim and fire but somehow this still happened and I had to bend the trigger a little to get it to work properly which was kinda sad after only using for a week.Overall, this is a really good controller but like other Razer products I’ve tried, it just falls short of being great because of minor design flaws.

  >>TOURNAMENT EDITION REVIEW>>I play on Xbox and PC frequently and often prefer controller to laze back. I've personally found scuf controllers to be mediocre, haven't bothered with the pricey ass Elite but I don't plan to. I absolutely love the PowerA Fusion- however I've gone through 3 of those in less than a year, so I decided to give this thing a try. Loving the Tournament Edition so far, grabbed it on sale for 80!My only gripe with this controller are the default short thumbsticks (as opposed to the ultimate edition). I already knew about this but then I saw that the extra kontrolfreeks I had for xbox one didn't work. I heard that the 360/PS4 ones did, so I bought some and they have a very snug fit. Work perfectly! Other than that, no complaints. You can customize the controller vibration sensitivity, there's a focus and agile feature that only work upon holding down a remappable button that's pretty neat (wish they would just activate/deactivate upon press instead)Overall the controller just has a really nice feel to it.Back buttons are way more attractive than the ultimate's in my opinion- all the extra buttons feel good. The remapping is limited but I was already planning to have them remapped to the face buttons. Be warned though: M1 ans M2 have a slight buzzy noise if pressing simultaneously. It doesn't bother me personally but I figured it might bother someone else.You can also customize the RGB through their app if the default flashy lightshow bothers you :) I made mine a static red.No issues so far, will update as I use regularly and switch out occasionally with my current Fusion controller.UPDATE MAR 15 2021Still using this controller, and I absolutely love it. I prefer it over my Fusion by a landslide. =]

  I bought this under the assumption that the customization options would be available for PC, as it's marketed as a PC (and XBOX) controller. Sadly, there's no way to customize the controller using the PC software. The controller is sturdy and has lots of paddles/buttons that most controllers don't have, but if you're not playing on XBOX it's kind of a brick compared to made-for-PC controllers. Definitely disappointed.I have a Razer keyboard and mouse I love, definitely not a brand bash. But this shouldn't be marketed as a PC controller (all XBOX controllers can be used with Windows 10 at a base level . . .)Add the controller to the Synapse software will get you 4 stars. (I expected this)Allowing me to map buttons to PC keystrokes will get you 5 stars. (Why wouldn't you add this?)

  Good controller but face buttons are gummy. Maybe that means it will last longer, but I otherwise don't care for that aspect of it.Luckily the whole point of a pro controller is mapping the face buttons to the back/top so you don't have to take your fingers off the thumbsticks.

",4.0,SirNeverSleep,"Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2021","









  
  
    
  Just wanna start off by saying I love this controller. It's comfortable in my hands, the mechanical switches are very tactile, the trigger stops work great, the interchangable parts are very well designed; but there are a few relatively minor issues with this controller that prevent me from being able to leave a 5 star review.My major gripe is that after roughly a year of regular use, (just long enough for the warranty to expire) I started getting a very noticeable drift from the analog sticks. I'm on my second one of these controllers, and both experienced the same issue, first the left stick and then the right one. And the issue just gets worse with time, and since the issue started about a month after the warranty expired, you're forced to just replace the controller or learn to deal with the drift. My only other complaint lies with the software that you are required to use in order to remap the extra buttons. The app only allows you to rebind those buttons to EXISTING inputs, and nothing extra. This means you are forced to bind them to X, Y, B, A etc. You can not bind them to, for example, additional hot keys in a mmo for items/abilities or whatever. And there is ZERO way to do this, even if you are on a pc, because razer forces you to use their crappy software to rebind the keys.

  So this is actually the second controller I got after returning the first to Amazon. The X button was faulty after a few days on the first controller. I got the second controller about 3 months ago and now the X button is doing the same thing. It will activate normally sometimes, then it will just be a dead button or activate 4/10 times. I use this controller to play a lot of 2D side scrollers, so it is very noticeable when I can't attack when I want to. The return window is closed so now I have to see if Razer will let me replace this for a new one.Great controller otherwise, but seems to be an issue with their key/button switches. I can not recommend this controller to other people after having issues within such a short time frame.

  I love it. The swappable sticks makes it extremely nice for customizing your perfect controller. I tried the Xbox elite series 2 twice before deciding to go with this controller. The series 2 just had too many problems, along with stick drift and loose paddles. The only thing I’d say is an issue, would be the paddles are slightly far for finger reach. So if you have smaller hands, maybe go with a scuf.

  The wolverine is not a ""bad"" controller. the buttons are all responsive and for those using it on an XBOX... it probably works as well or better than alternatives. The big problem here is for PC. Razor has taken it on them selves to not allow the paddles or any button to be remapped to anything outside of and XBOX controller button. this makes the controller near useless for a pc sadly. Even playing games that support xbox controllers your paddles (which I would assume is one of the large reasons for shelling out the dough for this) are still just repeats.Personally after playing with it for a while I dont see that using the paddles as an alternative to the regular ABXY buttons is any real benefit for 99% of games. If you search around you might see people mention reWASD. Unfortunately reWASD sees this as a regular xbox one controller instead of elite and does not let you remap the paddles which again kinda negates the reason to buy this controller over cheaper alternatives. reWASD says that to make the controller paddles work they would need cooperation from razor which they dont get. With wolverine v2 not including paddles I would say it is likely never to be supported at this point.After many hours of google fu I was unable to find anything that gave me hope of remapping the paddles making this just an over priced xbox one controller more or less.

    Great controller - bad longevity - worse support
  
",2.0,Sergey V.,"Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  Ordered this controller in April 2020 as an alternative to getting the more expensive Microsoft Elite Controller. Intending it to be a kind of middle-ground, with some of the Elite features.The good:Feels great in your hands, with very tactile, ""clicky"" buttons. Comfortable rubberized grips, and good resistance on the sticks and other buttons. The adjustable-depth triggers are great, as are the 4 additional buttons.The added buttons/triggers were the primary reason I had bought this controller. Very nice, premium-feeling product.The bad:By mid-June, the Y face button started working intermittently. Sometimes it would register keypresses, other times not. Cleaning with compressed air and rubbing alcohol did not have any effect. Yes, you can re-map the button to one of the additional buttons/triggers as a band-aid fix - but why should you have to do this?For a ""premium"" product at a premium price (twice that of a standard Microsoft wireless controller!) from a reputable manufacturer like Razer, it's disappointing to have the controller fail after 2 months - of course outside Amazon's return window. Especially so when you consider the price difference of the Wolverine versus a standard MS wireless controller, and the fact that those same regular controllers can last years without such issues. Really disappointing.The ugly:Razer support has taken almost a month from the initial inquiry on June 26th, and the issue with the controller has still not been resolved at of July 20. After 2 and a half weeks of sporadic communication, sending the same information multiple times, it has taken 5+ days to hear back from an RMA representative, which was expected ""within 24 hours"". I understand (and Razer has a very clear statement about this) the added challenges of working during the pandemic, but these kinds of interactions do not need to be extended for nearly a month.To wrap up:It's a great controller while it works, but considering the price and the extremely poor longevity, it's certainly not worth the premium over the standard Microsoft controller. The experience dealing with Razer's support sours the whole experience. Would have much rather just returned directly to Amazon and been done with it.

  I bought this because Microsoft had taken the Elite 2 off the shelves due to poor quality and my original Elite's paddles no longer function. I was wary at first, I've never been a fan of pretty much all 3rd party controllers, but I own other Razer products for my computer so I took the gamble. And wow, was I impressed. This thing feels amazing to hold. The buttons are clicky and quick and having 2 extra shoulder buttons is way nicer than it seems. You don't get as many thumbstick options, you can't adjust the sensitivity curve of the joysticks in the software either. The cord is plenty long so don't worry about it not being wireless. All in all, this thing is great and I actually prefer it over Microsoft's own option. The back paddles are nearly impossible to hit on accident, something I'd do with the Elite all the time. If you're looking for a replacement, or for your first ""pro"" controller, I highly recommend this one.

   I like the ergonomics and triggers are very comfortable on the fingers. The rumble also feels very nice because it's not too strong. The extra tiny bumpers come in handy as well. They are set to A and X which is nice for a bumper jumper set up without having to change control schemes in the game  The share and ""start"" button placement take a bit to get used to and I ran into an annoying problem. If you hold down either bumper first then hold down the trigger. The trigger rubs against the bumpers. It makes a loud click and lifts the bumper in the process. I feel over time it will break off because it also prevents fluid movement of the trigger. I demonstrated the problem in my video.

  So this controller was absolutely amazing to start out with. I bragged about it to all of my friends. I have larger hands so i do not like the XBOX elite controller because of where the buttons are on the back. But the 4 buttons in the back on the middle of the controller are amazing for gaming and functionality. I had the Wolverine ultimate controller.So the one plus side is Razer customer service has been very helpful and because of this I gave the controller an extra star. But other than that just disappointment. If I spend 160 dollars on a controller I expect the controller will last me a very long time but this controller is not built to last. I only had it 8 months and take very good care of it but it is unfortunately just not made for daily use. the M4 button on the back has become loose and when pressed down it also activates the m6 button which makes both buttons completely useless because who wants one button to do two jobs. In addition to the A button on the front does not bounce back so often times I press it and it just holds in, which is very disruptive to play.2 stars because I only had the controller for 8 months... now it is unusable...

    Sturdy, solid controller with dissapointing button remaping (PC)
  
",1.0,Barry Bednarski,"Reviewed in the United States May 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  You can only remap the ""extra"" buttons to an existing controller button (and 2 functions that increase/decrease the sensitivity of the sticks).  In my case I was hoping to use the extra buttons as more buttons to use on my controller, however they can only clone one of the existing buttons.  I was hoping this was just a limitation in Razer's software, but even with a 3rd party controller mapper these ""extra"" buttons can not be assigned since the firmware doesn't see them as their own buttons and will only let them perform the function of one of the existing controller buttons.But other than the misleading advertising and crap PC customization, this is a pretty nice controller.Pros:Sturdy housingResponsive buttonsCons:Dpad buttons are more effort to press than other controllers and can lead to fatigueWired""Extra"" buttons can only clone existing controller buttonsUpdate:  After 14 months (product has a 12month warranty), the B button no longer works properly, it has to be mashed down with extra force.  I guess I found a use for the extra shoulder buttons that can only be remapped to an existing button.  Disappointing for a $120 controller.  I will be looking elsewhere for my next controller purchase.

    Best Xbox One Controller out there.
  
",5.0,A. Castro,"Reviewed in the United States February 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this controller after having gone through 2 Xbox One Elite controllers. Those have lasted me, on average, about 2 years each. Both have ended up with busted bumpers, due to the infamously poorly designed dampeners they put on there, as well as the left joystick becoming non-functional after the many times I’ve used it while playing COD games (for running).I play mostly FPS shooters so take that in mind.I was ready to pony up another 175 for a new Elite controller again but came across the Razer Ultimate and decided (after doing my research online and on YouTube) that I would give the Razer a shot. I have not thought twice about my purchase and am a new, loyal fan of the Razer Ultimate. It has a sturdy build, feels solid in the hands and responds like a dream.A couple of things worth Mentioning. If you use Kontrol Freaks, they will NOT fit on these because the knobs are too wide....BUT, I was able to trim the edges of the rubber on the knob and get the Kontrol Freak on with no issue. Look it up on YouTube.Another thing that had me hesitant was the fact that this was not a wireless controller. But the chord is plenty long. That, combined with the reduced latency (since it’s plugged in) makes it an even trade off for me.In the end, do your own research to make the best decision for yourself, but personally, I am loving this controller.

  I've been playing with it all day, and I can say that it feels amazing. At first I thought that the back triggers were going to be hard to reach due to how they are positioned, and how my hands are not that big. The truth is that I was surprised with how perfectly everything is placed and how I can reach every single button and trigger without much effort. Button mapping with synapse is easy to do, but if you want to do so on the go while in a match, you can with the mapping button the controller provides. This controller is amazing!

  Razer Wolverine Ultimate for XB1:So, I've had this controller for a while now and it is a great buy. I've had and used everything from original controllers, scuf controllers, even built my own scuffs. But so far, this one simply wins.Pros:- Comfortable with textured grips and paddles to allow hours of handling without issues.- Crisp buttons, plus the bumpers are so much easier to reach and press, also making an audible 'click' when pressing. This goes for the ABXY buttons too.- More programmable buttons. Program the ones you need...even disable the ones you don't.- (Both potentially pro and con) - It's wired. Never worry About charging, making the controller even more lightweight and comfortable. The cord is long enough,and is strongly braided, even having the traditional quick disconnect if tripped on.- Customizable lighting on the controller and light intensity.- Control of Rumbler intensity in grips AND triggers.- Magnetized thumbsticks. It comes with a molded case with extra, extended thumbsticks.- Magnetized D-Pad.- Feels super solid. It's not flimsy feeling, it is not ""cheap and plasticky"", it has no ""hollow feel or clicking"" sound when playing. It feels nice and dense in build quality.- Sound Control. Easily balance game and chat on the controller.Cons- No mic monitoring at all. So far, there is simply no fix for this.- The extra bumpers on the controller are nice and crisp, but have the slightest play in them and you can hear a bit of rattle if you shake the controller. This is only the back bumpers, and does not take away from any of the quality of it.Best Tip:I've read reviews that there is no Synapse app for Windows 10. This is true, but you can store 2 player profiles on the controller (distinguished by Green and Blue LEDs). Using the Synapse App, Setup one profile for console, and the other for PC. In one click, you can easily switch from one to the other.The only thing left to see is its durability. I take care of my equipment, so we'll see how well it holds up to wear. Otherwise, I plan on sticking with this controller from now on.

  I needed something to replace my basic Xbox controller, and I wanted something with more button, so I went with the Razer Wolverine Tournament Edition controller, and I haven't been disappointed yet but I should put somethings out there. First the back grip on the right side is overlapping the other piece of rubber right where the crack is, causing a bump that annoys me as I have OCD, but its not a big deal and doesn't effect gameplay at all. The left back M3 button rattles a little, but once again it isn't that bad, but the controller cost a lot so you should demand perfection. The button presses feel great and the hair trigger option is cool. The extra buttons are great for things like COD and FFXIV. My PC recognized it immediately and everything just worked. Also the charging cord has a mold that makes it fit perfect for the controller with no risk of breaking it or wearing it out. 4/5 for me

    Broken within a month. Razer support horrible
  
",1.0,Miguel Gonzalez,"Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  I'm primarily a keyboard and mouse player, but I occasionally like to use a controller when playing lengthy RPGs. It lets me sit back and relax a bit in a way I just can't do with a normal PC setup. I initially bought a generic 3rd party xbox 360 controller since I prefer the feel of a 360 controller over the xbox one design. However that cheap controller arrived with a deadzone on the left stick. So not wanting a repeat of the previous purchase I decided to buy something a little pricier so that I wouldn't need to worry about build quality and cheap parts. After looking around I eventually convinced myself to drop the $89 for this during a sale. Needless to say I was pretty excited. The product arrived quickly with Prime and was working out off the box. That didn't last long. Less than a month in fact.As for the controller itself,  its one of the best feeling controllers I've ever used. The rubberized grips feel great. The travel distance on the face buttons felt weird initially, as you don't have to press as deeply to get them to click as you would on standard console controllers. But after a few days I was used to it, and it felt better than other controls. The extra buttons on the back were something I've never used before but I quickly found myself using them instead of the face buttons. Why take my finger of ""A""  button to turn with the right stick when I can hold the back trigger to run and turn at the same time.In order to change the lighting on PC you need to download some Razer software which I find entirely unnecessary. The controller does not work with Synapse. So if you already own a Razer product and have already installed Synapse you need to download separate software solely for the controller. The software itself is pretty bare bones. You can only change the lighting, and rebind the triggers to other bottoms. For example you can bind the left back trigger to any other button on the controller but you can't bind it to PC keys.Software aside this is without an exaggeration one of the best controllers I've  ever used. But, as you've probably guessed from the review score, there was a huge issue with it. Within less than a month the controller broke on me. I'm no stranger to broken controllers but I've never had such a premium controller fail after so short a time/. After about 25 hrs of total use I pressed the right trigger and it sunk in and would not pop back out. I thought dust or dirt may have caused it to stick but after so little use there is no way that much dust/dirt could have built up. I cleaned it with compressed air just in case and in doing so noticed some broken plastic through a gap in the trigger. I looked online to see if there was a quick fix and found that this issue is more common than one would expect. Tons of forum posts with the same issue. And in every case there wasn't really much the users could do but reach out to Razer support. So that's what I did. With a cheap 3rd party controller I don't care if if breaks and don't bother with returns or support but with a $90 dollar controller I have different expectations.A part of my real world job requires I often reach out to company's support and while I have generally had issues with some it is overall a straightforward experience that results in my getting the support I need. Not so with Razer. After sending a Proof of purchase and an explanation of the issue that was clearly a hardware issue with the device itself they asked I send a video of the issue. I do so and when I hear back they ask I try connecting the controller to another USB slot on my PC. Why? The video already showed it was a hardware issue. OK I comply and naturally nothing changes and I let them know. They then ask me to connect the controller to an Xbox or another PC. Again, why? So after about a week of putting of with even more of their pointless responses and not getting anywhere closer to getting a replacement device I decided to go instead through Amazon. I was fortunate enough that the controller broke within the 30 day Amazon return period so I was able to send in the controller with NO questions asked. I just needed to drop off to a UPS store.  I am currently waiting on the replacement and will update this review when I receive the second. Here is hoping the quality control isn't as bad this time around.

  I am genuinely satisfied with this controller. Was looking for a more competitive controller with paddles/buttons on the bottom that didn't cost $180 or $300 like other brands charged. Razer delivered. The controllers feels just right in the hands although it does feel smaller than the default XB1 controller. Also be aware that the thumb sticks are slightly bigger than the default controller meaning you will not be able to put on kontrolfreeks. Anyways great controller, the buttons feel nice, the controller fits nice in your hands , the cable is braided/more durable, the part of the controller where the charging cable connects to the controller is super secure meaning it won't bend at the weak point the way it does on other controllers, has a great app that makes it easier to customize your button layout, and the icing on the cake is, it has a gorgeous lighting system allowing you customize it any way you want.

  After going through 4 elite controllers in the past 2 years, I was looking for an alternate and dove in when black Friday came along. Amazon has always been great in getting product to my house when promised and this arrived a day early to my surprise. Anxious to give it a try, I opened it and quality looked and felt great although a bit light and doesn't feel as good in my hands as the Elite does (I prefer some weight to my controller). Although I would have love to try this out, my hands did not fit up to all of the back buttons. I wear ML gloves for reference. I could not reach the bottom buttons without rotating my hands towards the bottom to hit the M4-6 buttons thus dragging either my left or right thumb sticks with it. I think if you have long fingers or larger hands, this wouldn't be an issue. I hope this helped out people that may have the same size hands as I do.

  I am very dissatisfied with the performance of this controller. The first time I bought it, within a week the left trigger would stick down and not come back up. It was unplayable so I sent it back and ordered a new one. The second time I bought it, the right joystick's sensitivity was almost like completely gone. I had to up my game sensitivity to a 10 to even play with it because of how slowly it moved. I even took another controller to test them both and sure enough the wolverine was moving about a quarter of the speed of the other controller. Only when I actually pushed the joystick down and moved it to the right or left did it move at a regular speed. What I am saying is these controllers are made cheap, and I take care of my products and it is unfortunate to see such a great concept ruined by cheap manufacturing.

  If it had subscribe and save I would give it one and a half. Started glitching days after the warranty ran out. Not worth the money. With less than 1200 hours played (I almost exclusively played Warframe this past year when using my Xbox) the left bumper started glitching. Glaringly obvious when play Limbo and instead of sliding you roll into the rift. Also notable when rotating through menus with the bumpers. ZERO glitches when going right and intermittent glitches when going left. Figuring ""why not"" I submitted a ticket before the review to see if Razer would stand behind their product so close the the end of the warranty. No, they hide behind their policy. Since the Amazon selected retailer wasn't an ""authorized"" reseller they used that to brush of the already expired warranty. Morally reprehensible and legally questionable. So, there you have it potential buyers. Rather than merely pointing to the warranty being expired they drudged up a policy that would have left me hanging if there was a glitch on day one. So, if you mean to buy this controller and the seller isn't ""Amazon Direct"" I wouldn't buy it. Or, if you insist feel free to email Razer support to verify the validity of the seller.

  This controller is far and away the best gaming experience I've ever had. The textured grips take a little time to get used to but eventually feel like you're not holding anything, especially after long or intense gaming sessions.The extra paddles and sensitivity buttons really change the way I understand the games I play and really help me get in the game.The configuration app is very easy to use, and offers a comprehensive guide to what everything does and really makes the controller custom to the user.Also good quality in the manufacturing side, holds up to rage and controller abuse very well!!One slight issue, occasionally, the controller will not transmit an input, and that has lead to a lot of frustration as it tends to cause unwanted movement and can cause issues during fights.All in all, a very good purchase and avery happy experience!Edit: September, 2020: There was a firmware update that fixed the input issues. Since updating I've had no qualms about recommending this to anyone who is serious towards enjoying their gaming sessions.

  This is the most comfortable Xbox controller I have ever tried and this is coming from an XB elite user. The XB elite controller was great except the response time with the buttons was noticable after awhile. After having my eye on the Razer controller for awhile I decided to pull the trigger. I'm so happy I did !My fingers felt so nice  and natural on the back triggers the second I held it in my hands. It is extremely lightweight, and the buttons have a clicky-mouse feel to it. The responsiveness is insanely noticable. I actually prefer wired controllers so that was a huge plus for me.

  I'm using this exclusively on PC, so far I love this controller, but the D-pad needs work. The buttons are harder to push than a normal controller, with either D-pad option, and they don't feel natural. I can't differentiate between up, down, left, right as fast so I feel like I'm always searching for the right button.Also the start/select buttons are way too tall, and the button press isn't linear, the buttons wobble so they are hard to press since they are so tall and rub against the sides. They feel like they get stuck halfway through the button press. The rest of the buttons are great though.The triggers feel like they have a bit more resistance than normal controllers, and the resistance isn't linear, it's more springy, which feels nice.The controller vibration is great, best I've felt from this style of rumble, and it's very strong, yet feels smooth, and the controller doesn't rattle from the vibration, which gives it a very quality feel.The trigger rumble is super strong, wow, and does cause rattles but it's so strong, how could it not? But alas on PC, I've only got to feel the triggers rumble in the setup app, because the feature is narrowly supported on xbox, and apparently non-existent on PC, because I haven't found any games that used it.The ability to adjust analog sensitivity on the fly is a life saver.But there is one more thing and that's parts availability. There is none. You can't even buy extra parts. You can contact Razer for replacement parts if yours are defective, but that's it.So, that means you're stuck with what's in the box. If you lose analog sticks or a d-pad or your dog chews them or you break them, you have to buy a new controller, because analog sticks from other brands don't fit, and Razer won't sell you more. I'm sure this is 100% intentional so that's why I'm deducting two stars.Not only does it cripple the controller's potential lifespan, it limits your configurations. I can't run two tall sticks for racing games (I use analog sticks for steering and brake/gas) because it only comes with one. You can't buy more from Razer and nobody else makes anything that fits, so I'm stuck having to choose whether I want precise control for steering or precise control for brake/gas; I can't choose both.Also, the extra buttons aren't truly mappable, only mappable to other buttons on the controller, which yes, is great for some games, but useless when you need custom keymappings.Had I'd known the negatives first, I'd have avoided this controller. It's not worth the premium, and is likely to become useless before it stops working, due to detachable,  yet non-replaceable parts.

  I am a PC gamer and I recently purchased NBA2K20. A game where the keyboard is really awful to use and using a controller is best. I wanted a nice control and a regular one was about $60 so it was worth $30 more for a razer controller. I opened it and was estatic only to realize the X button didn't even work. The X is used to shoot in NBA2K and shooting is literally the most important thing in the game. If someone is going to pay a large sum of money for a controller that is ""far superior"" to a regular controller the buttons should work. The buttons work on a 10 dollar controller. Total waste of $90. The refunding process is painful too. Don't bother with this. If your willing to pay this much for a controller just buy the real thing from Razer for $120 ish

  The remappable buttons were something I never bought into. I didn't use them. I just wanted to have a controller for gaming that felt good, good button response (almost tactile, clicky!) and had a bit of that obnoxious RGB flair to it. I found my self pressing said buttons on accident a few times that made it difficult for me to play games of various genres. I didn't take the time to see if I could disable them or map them to nothing so they wouldn't register an input. But if you want to essentially program a button (not sure if Macros are possible with this controller) then this would be for you. It really, really felt good when I wasn't accidentally pressing those buttons.What did surprise me, was that while the cord is detachable, this controller has to be wired at all times. This does not have a wireless function. Not a big deal for me because I used it on the PC (pc games and xbox streaming) but for someone looking to have a home set up and lounge on the couch...better make sure you've got an extension or you're close enough to your console.

",2.0,Passed,"Reviewed in the United States April 15, 2019","









  
  
    
  UPDATE!!!!!The cable is very finicky.  Even though it is connected as far in as it can go, if it get bumped it will disconnect the controller and you will have to push it in, but you won't even realize you did anything until the controller lights back up.  After a couple of days I have gotten used to the buttons, but I still enjoy the Elite's natural feel of the back buttons.  Again I'd still prefer the Elite because of that, and since I don't have to worry about making the cord angry and my controller disconnecting mid game.There are two things are terrible about this controller.1) The buttons on the back of the controller are in terrible spots.  You have to stretch to get to the bottom ones and to me the placement doesn't feel natural at all compared to the Xbox One Elite controller.  The back buttons on that controller are awesome.2) The way the aux jack is set up you can not really have any wired headset like the Astro A50s because of the way they plug into the controller.  Luckily I had a cord lying around that had the two sizes of jacks that were needed for the headset and controller.The controller itself feels very sturdy and I love the buttons and triggers.  Also being able to remap the buttons is AMAZING!!!! The reason I play with a Scuf, Elite, or this controller is for the extra buttons on the back and so far out of those three it is the worse.  I would take an Xbox Elite controller over this one any day of the year.  Maybe after time I could get used to stretching my fingers to reach the buttons on the back, but the easier idea would be to return it for a better controller.

    Much better controller for PC and Xbox one gaming than Microsoft's standard controllers
  
",5.0,alex,"Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've been gaming for a while as I started out gaming on PC and then also PlayStation before the 2nd one came out. Then later I got a Xbox 360 and my gripe with it was how cheap the controller buttons were. On my PS2 and 3 controllers each button press felt just right. On 360 controllers both the D-pad and RB + LB buttons were just horrid. I ran into a number 360 controllers where the RB or LB just didn't work. My own wired 360 controller that I used with my PC just never felt good to use. For games that leaned on the D-pad I just avoided using the XBOX controllers all together after playing Assassins Creed with it. After that I was really disappointed in how little the Xbox one controllers improved over the 360 controller. So when PS4 controller support grew for the PC I just used it whenever possible.This controller though really changed most of what I've felt is wrong with the quality of Microsoft's controllers. The D-pad is just like I've always wanted from an Xbox style controller and each button at last clicks just right. My only minor complaint is the RB and LB feels less than intuitive to press due to the ergonomics of the controller.  I works very well with both my PC and Xbox one X. Going to say now that this controller will be all I use on any Xbox from now on. Now as for pros and cons:PROS:- Separated D-pad is what I love most. It can make a real impact if you are like me and tend to hit off center where on a MS controller it will cause a different direction than what you intended.- Much better face buttons with a smooth defined click.- A tighter slightly smaller frame and a bit more comfortable shape in hand.- Triggers feel good both with and without using the stop. It's a notable improvement over the standard controller.- A quality long cable for living room use.- 4 programable buttons for use on PCCONS:- The RB + LB buttons could be improved some. It's still way better than Microsoft controllers however.- No wireless. Doesn't really matter to me, but it's worth noting considering the cost here.- The RGB light is kind of bright for me.I got this during Prime day, but now having used it I would say it's worth the MSRP. I rate this a 9.5/10 because other than my nit picking it's near perfection for a wired controller.

I haven't experimented with any shooting games besides Gears of war 4 and boy i tell you im able to pull of moves i couldn't do with an regular controller. The buttons click similar like an mouse would on a pc, and has 2 sets of directional pad options. 4 extra buttons you can swap for multi-function use. This controller includes led lights in the front that can change patterns to your likings. The only con that really doesn't matter to me is that its wired only. It does however have an long usb cord, so that shouldn't be a problem. Also the price if your an casual gamer, this controller is meant for competitive players looking to compete or take their game to another level. 5 stars no doubt

  Yo, this product is hyped up and throws a lot of gimmicks at you to make it seem like it has additional value.First off, the thumb-sticks are totally proprietary and are differently structured.  They are short in length, which is just inherently bad.  The surface is a big, slightly concave saucer that is not inherently a flaw, but they make the surface area too big to fit any third party stick attachments to remedy these flaws.  If your competitive or like to try-hard, you are stuck with the below average thumb-stick design in both comfort and performance that isn't even as good as the stock controller (they have higher tension).They intentionally do not follow the industry standard of universally sized sticks nor do they meet the competitors features of exchangeable sticks so you have the option to not use trash hardware.  Rather, they have all these seemingly standard features only available on the ""Ultimate"" version to force you to spend more money.  Great business, but scummy nonetheless.  If scummy and/or predatory market practices bug you, then you'd do better to stay away from this product.  This particular product is so egregiously far under the baseline quality you'd expect from this price-point, just so they have an excuse to sell you their more expensive, flagship controller.Second, the buttons.  They are ""mechanical"" or whatever (meaning they are made to click like a good gaming keyboard).  These do work as advertised, but who cares?  They are NOT an improvement.  They are not inherently bad either, it is just another gimmick they can put on the box to justify the price-point.  Just kinda goofy.Lastly, size and extra buttons.  The paddles on the back are good.  You will be accidentally mashing them until you get used to them, but they are fine and seem like they would last.  The additional bumper buttons are kinda dope, great for the lazy homies who can't be bothered to use their pointer finger that come on their hand to push face buttons.  Its also smaller then the default controllers?? Why would they do this lmao, who the heck asked for an even smaller version of an already small controller.  Like many choices made for this product, you just ask yourself ""why?"".Review:-Thumb-sticks aren't even as good as the generic stock controller (weird dimensions, too short, very little tension).-Scummy and predatory marketing practices (this controller is fundamentally obsolete to the more expensive controllers).-Buttons are whatever.  Different but not better.-Hair-triggers are too deep to actually make a significant difference.-All features are essentially just gimmicks.-Incompatible with third-party stick attachmentsSummary:Just use the dang pointer finger thats on your hand to push the face buttons instead of dancing your thumb around like a goof.  Or, if you are hell bent on taking your thumb of the stick to hit buttons and you truly can't be bothered to fix it, just buy one of those $20-30 paddle attachments and slap it onto the back of your regular controller (and throw on a $5 pack of controlfreak things if you like accuracy in shooters or comfort).  All in all, can be a cool party trick for friends, but is marginally inferior to the $40 default controller.

  Clearly there are some very unreasonable critiques of this controller. It’s hands down better than anything else out there. The only downside is as a person with huge hands, any controller feels toy like to me. Once you adapt and learn this setup, there is no comparison.

  The look of the product is amazing and has a great feel. The customizable buttons and toggles are a great feature as well but the most important thing is the operation. The trigger response is adjustable for quick fire but fails with delay. It should not have delay being a corded controller. I would expect it from a wireless controller.  I'll simply say that controller response is crucial in the gaming world. Spend a few extra dollars and get the Elite series 2 wireless. No lag at all and you can customize it like the Wolverine.

  I enjoyed using this controller for the features as mentioned by other users. The ergonomics are great, and the back two buttons come in handy. I added removable grips to the sticks, and instantly improved utility.Notable Cons:- can't program ALL buttons. This is a software fix! C'mon Razer; update your Synapse app and firmware. Currently, only extra buttons are programmable to old buttons.- ABXY buttons and D-pad on my controller felt stiffer than usual, and does not always register all keysSo, I am returning this controller and switching the the ultimate edition. The ultimate edition is about the same price when on same during the holidays. It has better button feels, more sensitive (and stronger) sticks, and additional mic control. Definitely worth the switch if the price is right!

If you leave your Xbox off for a few hours or disconnect and reconnect the controller with the Xbox off, then the contoller won't turn the Xbox back on with the home button.

  Pros:It feels sturdy. Cool lights. Useful buttons.Cons:It’s a huge difference in ergonomics from the OEM controller’s. It feels extremely bulky in my hands. It actually makes me play worse during competition than with an OEM controller. Even with using the shortened sticks, I’m struggling to be fast and reach these skyscrapers in time. They also come off a lot because they are held by magnets. After a month of use, the stick is now clicking and cracking like it’s ready to break. For the price, this is a downer.Also, the build quality seems okay but check out the Xbox button. It’s crooked.

  I bought this controller (the Tournament ed) for use on a PC since, in my opinion, some console games don't translate well to PC.  I was excited to be able to use and program the 4 additional buttons in any way I wanted, and the Chroma lighting would look awesome with my custom-made PC, which uses RGB-cycling LEDs.  Well, to my disappointment, the additional buttons can ONLY be programmed as controller buttons (Y, X, A, B, R Trigger, etc etc).  So all they are good for is repositioning buttons on the controllers (like, moving the A button to a faster, more reachable spot).  You can't reprogram the buttons to a macro or any keyboard button.Other than that, the controller works great, feels comfortable in the hand, and looks nice.  However, unless you only want to be able to reposition controller buttons, I'd recommend saving half your money on a regular XBox One or 360 controller (I'm returning this and doing the same).  $120 isn't worth the money on PC.

  I spent a long time deciding on a controller to upgrade to before picking the Wolverine Ultimate. I love the feel of it and the customizability. A few of the mappable buttons are a pain to hit (the upper two of the back four), but since most controllers only have four mappable buttons I haven't been upset at all about this difficulty. The cord is a bit of an annoyance but never having to charge the controller or replace batteries is a plus, and I don't sit farther than the length of the cord away anyway.

The right joy stick has also begun to lose some of its responsiveness when clocking down on it, it will either be very delayed or I will have to click on it many times for it to work.If the features that made it so fun to use lasted longer than they do, this would have been 5 stars.

For the money it was a gamble because I wanted something nice but on the other hand I haven't had much experience with Razer Products. Due to the incident I doubt that I will use them again due to the short life span of the controller and for the amount they cost I figured I'd be able to use the controller well over a year.

",4.0,Gavin,"Reviewed in the United States January 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  Pros:After using this controller for three months, I can't imagine gaming with any other handheld controller. The extra bumper between the trigger and regular bumper brings a whole new aspect to mappable buttons. It feels completely natural and has been my go-to rather than the usual bumper you see on every other Xbox controller. The feel of the ABXY buttons is extremely satisfying and gives a solid *click* feedback similar to a mouse click. It brings the mechanical keyboard aspect of PC gaming into an Xbox controller. I have not experienced any issues with the magnets in the joysticks. I imagined they would slip off during intense gaming sessions, but I have yet to experience that thanks to the solid twisting lock mechanism. Personally, I don't use any of the extra thumb sticks that comes with the controller, but I can see how many other people would enjoy them. The D-pad also gives a very good feedback similar to the ABXY buttons.Cons:Although I don't use the hair trigger function, it doesn't seem to work very well anyway. With hard enough presses on the trigger, I can notice the trigger lock giving and the trigger slipping down further. I also don't believe the paddles in the back are comfortable to press. They have a satisfying feedback like most of the other buttons on the controller, but they seem too far in the middle and a little far down the back for my taste. Again, not much of a problem for me as I don't utilize them, just like the trigger locks.P.S.I have since bought another controller new, but take caution when buying used. Of course I knew there might be issues buying the controller used, but no defects were apparent at all for the first few months. Up until two weeks ago, I had no problems with the controller. Since then, the left analog stick has been starting to go out and not respond to certain movements. After contacting Razer about my warranty, which I had no information on before hand, they told me my warranty expired in July of 2019 (Warranty only lasts a year after purchase). Just beware when buying used because it is likely out of warranty by the time you receive the controller.

I went to get another one but it was out of stock for longer than I could wait.  So, I bit the bullet and bought this expensive monster. (I wasn't going to go back to the basic controller, I'm spoiled now) . the thumbsticks are okay, the d-pad is a little clicky, and the face buttons feel a little cheap and not as tactile. I'll use it and it works, but it's not a favorite at this point.Update 08/27/2020 : one drop and the left bumper button became stuck and those magnetic thumbsticks and d-pad flew off all over the room.. The PowerA  Pro Fusion came back in stock so I got it again..if this one fails I'm going back to Amazon basics...advice? if you don't tote your controller around or have dogs who like to wrap themselves up in cords, still avoid this controller. You're paying 2x the price of most controllers for the RGB lighting and name but  not for build quality.

  First off, I'm as cheap as the next guy, but I also feel strongly that more often than not, you get what you pay for.Cheap hardware gives cheap performance and ergonomics.This is the second Razer product I've purchased, and I remain highly impressed with their quality, fit, and finish, and the obvious attention they pay to gamer wants and needs.  I've been an avid gamer for most of my life, but this is the first brand I can remember where I've been actually excited to see how they will package the product - they put as much care and attention into the quality of the packaging as they do the device itself, which adds to the cost, sure, but it is another indication of the overall quality and the support they also offer to their customers.An old craftsman's saying comes to mind: Buy an expensive tool and it will only hurt once when you buy it.  Buy a cheap tool and it'll hurt every time you use it.  Of course, a lot depends on how often you use the thing, but I expect I'll be gaming for decades to come.  I'm sure this and other Razer peripherals will work well and comfortably long after I've forgotten the price I paid for them.  I can't wait to see what they roll out next!

  Controller feels great. Love the mechanical keys as well as the trigger-stoppers which make the triggers activate at half-press. If you play a game that needs a full motion trigger (IE likely not a first person shooter), the stoppers slide off and you get the full range of the triggers back. The buttons are fairly easy to re-map, although as a PC user it's still only restricted to re-mapping XBOX buttons around (You can't bind F5 to the bottom buttons for example) and you have to use the XBOX Razer app from the windows market place since the controller is not compatible with synapse. I use mine exclusively for PC as I do not own an XBOX and can say that it works great for my purposes.  Would highly recommend to anyone considering buying a higher end controller.

    Best competitive gaming controller
  
",5.0,Tracy,"Reviewed in the United States March 3, 2021","









  
  
    
  Bought this controller Oct 2018. I have gamed heavily with this controller over that span (at least 4-6 days a week).******Pros - durability, mechanical buttons, remappable buttons between bumpers, wired connection...-I take care of my electronics but controllers by nature face a lot physical wear and tear. This controller is built like a gaming keyboard. My most used button (extra bumper) has just broken but is still functional-it just wiggles freely in the controller case. I habe had minor stick drift in the past few months but it took 2 years to get to that point vs. A month or 2 with the standard xbox controller. Upon dissasembly to clean, it was like a bank vault. Many layers of hard/thick plastic. Build quality is not cheap in any aspect. Also the micro usb is unscathed. Usually something cheaped out on with electronics is probably the best sync cable I've ever used-mechanical keys are equivalent of a gaming keyboard. Though they can be a tad noisy, the low latency and durability paired with a wired connection is superior to any controller button on the market for competitive gaming-remappable keys are amazing. The bumper(rear triggers next to micro usb port) binds are placed amazingly and are unique to razer. The extra 4 bottom buttons I dont use much because I use the ""3rd bumper"" alongside RB/RT so much more comfortably than the bottom buttons common in scuf/elite/etc controllers. I find the bottom buttons to be awkward to use with my less coordinated ring and pinky fingers.*****Cons - synapse app only usable on Xbox, only 2 extra thumbsticks-synapse customization is only usable on an xbox so on PC I cannot change RGB (not a big deal i just see many complaints in reviews about this). I can manually map extra keys so it is not preventive to pc functionaly at all.-there is only 1 long concave thumb stick, 1 short domed stick, 2 short concave sticks. I have been unable to find extra/replaceable sticks as the rubber has worn out on mine. Very frustrating but not a breaking point since aftermarket extenders/caps are cheap and available.OVERALLI SEE MANY BAD REVIEWS but all in all this controllers build quality, low latency/mechanical buttons, unique trigger/bumper remappable binds and mid tier price point is unmatched by the elite/scuf controllers. It is well worth the money and I reordered my replacement without hesitation.

  Ok, let's pro/con this product.  As with all products, there are good and bad points to them all.Pros:- wired means no more batteries dying mid game- 2 additional buttons over the Elite controller (works great for Monster Hunter World)- M3-M6 buttons feel more Naturally placed than the Elite paddles.- ABXY buttons are more responsive and feel more like a mouse click.- Controller feels lighter due to the absence of a battery pack.- Cord is a durable, Nylon braid, and has a breakaway feature to avoid accidentally pulling your system off the shelf (or kids tripping over the cord).- Synapse software is easy to use, and the controller can store multiple profiles for several users or games, with quick switching enabled with the touch of a button.- No more fumbling to mute you're mic with on board mute button- Switching between game and party chat volume levels is as easy as holding the volume button and pressing left or right on the D-pad, no more going into the xbox menu.  This can be a life saver when you need to talk to a Party member or hear some boss fight details and need to do it fast.- On the fly button remapping is simple and quick with the remapping button on the controller, without having to go into the software and wasting time.- 10 ft cable gives you plenty of distance between your TV and couch/chair.- The color system (CHROMA) can be set to a number of modes and colors, making it ideal for any situation, and can be set up different for each profile.- Thumbsticks move more fluid and feel more responsive than the stock or elite controllers.- Button placement.  The M1 and M2 buttons I feared would be more in the way than useful, but was I wrong.  With Monster Hunter, it was always a pain to cycle through my quickbar to use an item. The Wolverine allows me to remap M1 and M2 to the left and right d pad controls so I can swap items without halting my attacks.- Swappable Dpad and Tilt pad designs are easy to change and both are quite responsive.  No more rubber below the buttons means fast response time, and no degraded functionality over time.Cons- Wired cord means restricted sitting distance.  This can be solved with a USB extension cord or MIDI extension cable, but out of the box you only get a 10 ft reach.As you can see, I don't really have any real cons for this product.  I am ecstatic about it and love my new controller.

  I usually dont write reviews, but there are things that need to be said about this product and I need you to listen. Before starting I just want to say a friend and I both purchased one of these and we are both just as disappointed. Our controllers are also not defective as we have been able to compare numerous controllers and they are all like this. Beware all the hype. Its hard to rag on something a person spent so much money on and I feel a lot of users are giving Razor too much benefit of the doubt. Build quality is subpar at best, i dont see the controller lasting any longer than my elite controller. Analog sticks are loose and are not tight enough for percision FPS games. Me and many other users are already experiencing problems and wished we saved our money for the new elite controller coming out later this year. This product is falsely advertised to work on pc and xbox. It cannot do anything for pc. Like literally, you cannot key bind any of the 6 extra buttons. It is not compatible with pc synapse software. In some games such as overwatch the increase and decrease sensitivity triggers dont work. For xbox it works, but you still cannot map the buttons as ""novel"" buttons, only duplicate a button. For over $100 this controller falls short of 50% of what it is technically advertised and designed to do. I contacted support to see what could be done, company literally sent me in circles for hours confused about what their own product could and couldnt do. Buy an Elite controller, software exists to map the buttons and at least it has TRUE dual functionality. $100+ for a controller with pretty lights, redundant buttons, no PC compatibility and and subpar build quality is a terrible investment. And lastly no, there is no 3rd party software available anywhere that can fix any of the problems I have listed. I love Razor, but the experience owning this was so bad I can't in good conscious vouch for any part of this product (except maybe chroma?). I feel like I was cheated of a lot of money and I hope I can save someone out there from making the same mistake I made.

  As of today I cannot speak of the longevity of this controller however after a full day of playing I felt I needed to help people who are trying to decide between this and the elite. I love this controller, it's strange at first because it feels like a mouse because the abxy buttons click and it is light in weight. The grips are a nice plus, the paddles are a little out of the way but when your not using the paddles (like on casual or games where it isn't necessary) that makes it comfortable and feel like a standard controller. I experimented with the agility and focus modes, not great on the game I was on but I see the potential on other and future games. The lights were a nice aesthetic too, but I forgot about it in about an hour.In summaration, I felt that it was money well spent. It's seems sturdy, it has the hair trigger and long pull like the elite, plus two more mappable buttons with the addition of on the fly mapping and quick swap profiles. Also the magnets on the joy sticks are strong so I feel confident about that. If you had to choose this seems wise but you couldn't go wrong with the elite either, that being said I do not regret this purchase; it boosted my ratings in one day by a significant amount.

I like the mechanical keys , they are so easy to press and always pressed not like the reguler sometimes they not . all the buttons are similiar to the Elite Controller which is great cause I wanted the same feel of elite but with better feedback and better analog sticks because the Elite have big issue with the analogs.  need to calibrate them because they are not 100% straight which makes the dead zone really effect the movement when you move to either side and lift your finger the stick would move to the other side making another movement in the game... 2 controllers that I bought same issue. never had issue with normal ps3 or ps4 controllers and also this razer . so it's something with the elite that annoyed me. the windows 10 is great . even better than the elite xbox app. all settings there.overall razer made great unbeatable controller.

  Was looking forward to trying this controller out. It feels great in the hands, sticks, buttons all felt good. When i turned on the Xbox and loaded up the Razer app, i noticed right away this controller had stick drifting on the left analog stick. It was an unfortunate first time experience with this controller, so i am sending it back for a refund. May try my luck another time but I'm a little concerned with quality control, from my own experience and other reviews.

  I  used to game on a console  for games like Destiny 2 so had a hard time transitioning to a keyboard and mouse, I bought a cheap controller at first thinking there was no big difference and it was a disaster. Bought the Razor and it offers a variety of button mappings and sensitivity controls that vastly improved my gameplay. Highly recommend this for people like myself who like the feel of a controller.

    Solid Controller but Buyer Beware
  
",3.0,MarkinNM,"Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is a really solid controller but the manual and documentation directs the user to their website to download the Razer Synapse app to set up button remapping and color changes for the lighting.  The problem is that the Razer Synapse app on the PC does not support the controller at all.  If you are a PC user (and I am), you cannot control the lighting at all but the button remapping works if you follow the directions on which buttons to push in what order.Bottom line, I like the controller but it's simply not worth the money.  For $120+ it should do the things the enclosed manual says it will do.  Also note that the Synapse app is supposed to work on xBox One.  I have no idea if this is accurate.

    Bad quality control, bad customer support

  Edited: today I received a replacement from Razer. Update the rating to 3 stars because the customer support exists and functions.I don't usually write review, but I have to write one for this controller.I bought this on Oct. 11, 2020, and it broke on Oct. 31, 2020. The button 'A' just suddenly stopped responding, no matter how many times or how hard I press it.  All I did in those 20 days with it, is I used it to play Ori, on average 3 hours per day at most, and I guess I pressed 'A' too many times so it broke.Then I went to contact Razer support via email, and it's been 1 week since my first contact. They have been asking tons of questions and even asked me to upload a video to show my controller's problem, but there's no solution provided.After I read some reviews of this controller on Amazon, I realized the quality control is just so bad and issues are very common. I lost my faith in this product and went to order a SCUF, while waiting for SCUF to ship my new controller,  I purchased another Razer controller. Because to be fair this is a good controller, I'll be happy as long as the second one can last another 3 weeks till my SCUF arrives.However, for you guys that DO worry about spending $100+ on a controller that might stop working in 1 month, think twice before you order it!

  This controller is great! I've been an avid user of the XBOX ELITE controller but their poor construction causes them to eventually break no matter what. Only reason I stuck with the elite controller is because I had a protection plan at Best Buy so every time one broke I was able to trade it in for a new one. I'm done with that now. This controller is just like the elite in performance and accessibility but has a more of a precision feel to it. The ABXY buttons have a COMPLETELY different feel than normal buttons, they are more like mouse clicks, no real push to them. At first I didnt like it but I quickly got used to them. The grip to the controller is amazing. Take it from a guy who puts in long hours gaming that this is the most comfort ive gotten from a controller- no cramps- nothing. The extra buttons are in great spots, unlike the elite controller. Overall I highly recommend this controller. Only down side is that its wired but the cable it comes with is quality, braided and very long.

  Its nice they built the grips onto the controller instead of using the sticky type like the wild cat but.. the feel of this controller is iffy the wild cat had a sturdy feeling this 1 the buttons seem super light weight n loose plus I had to ship my first 1 back because the A button did a double click.. no matter how soft or quick it was pressed this new 1 has a catch in the right trigger n right bumper if pressed together.. not to happy with the controller over allUpdateNew controller now does the x2 click on the X. Isnt present during game play neither was the firsts controller but.. Xbox messages or in-game messages it x2 clicks for X so yeah this controller either has horrible quality control or the button design itself is flawed.  Loved my wildcat just a shame the sticks where none quick replacement: ( I wouldn't recommend this controller

  After three uses the controller stopped working. I have plugged it in to both my Xbox One and PC and both share the same indications. The lights wont turn on and both end points do not register the controller as turned on.I called the Razer Helpdesk and had a technician walk me through the troubleshooting steps and came to the same conclusion. He said he would follow up with an email in regards to further assist me and the email never came. He gave me the ticket number of 191 214 001 055 and still nothing.Update: I called the Razer Helpdesk again and was stuck on hold so I decided to email them requesting on my existing ticket.

  The product worked well for a few months then in the middle fo a gta session while driving my audio cut out from my headphones. I thought this was an issue with the headset so I bought another only to find out the razer controller is the issue and no longer plays game audio properly while a standard controller works fine with a 3d audio headset. This is unacceptable for the product to just partially break in the middle of a session less than a year of owning it. I'd be willing to try another but sadly this was a gift and the buyer didn't select the insurance plan so I am left in the void. Just wanted to warn anyone else about this weird issue I am having with the controller.

  Don't buy if you want dedicated directional pad input for games like Tekken, I've played Tekken for a long time and this is the worst d-pad I've ever played on.

  CONS - The software for this device comes from Microsoft. There is absolutely no changing the extra buttons, on the back, to a useful combination of the face / trigger buttons. Which made it no better than the one I already had.PROS - The construction is sound and the buttons are super responsive thanks to Razer.

  PC review. It’s a great wired remote. The ability to adjust the trigger press depth is nice. Buttons are very clicky and feels like good quality remote. The software is Xbox software copied over to windows which is just odd, no mouse support. No instructions for said software. Still unsure of some settings. Button remap is not what I expected, was hoping to make a LB+RB button but can’t be done. Additional buttons have yet to prove useful since it can’t be programmed to a key button, you’re locked with just gamepad buttons. I found it dumb the controller isn’t recognized at all by synapse software. Color change options done via controller app. I switched to this controller due to regular Xbox controllers disconnecting randomly during long game sessions on pc. 3/5 stars for a pc controller. 4/5 if it was used for Xbox which isn’t what I bought it for.

    One fatal flaw (Updated)
  
",4.0,Jeremy,"Reviewed in the United States November 30, 2019","









  
  
    
  Without this one flaw, it would be 4 or 5 stars. The controller feels well made, nice weight, buttons are very responsive.However, sometimes pressing R3 (pressing down on the right joystick) causes aggressive drift of the right stick. For FPS games, this means you begin looking directly rightward (I play on a high sensitivity, so my player will turn 180 degrees very quickly).This flaw makes the controller unusable for FPS games (unless you don't mind dying or losing). I will be attempting to get a replacement for the controller and will update this review if that happens.EDIT 12/4/19: Got a replacement controller, updating to 4 stars from 2.  The controller feels fantastic, hair triggers and buttons are very crisp.  Just feels good to hold, honestly.  If the first item hadn't had the flaw above, would have been 5 stars from the get-go.

  Such an awesome controller for the price! I was stipulating getting the Elite 2 but I always hated the paddle layout and therefore only could ever use two of the paddles. With this Razer, I utilize all 6 of the extra buttons which are laid out very well!Only one con so far out of the 3 months of using it and that is the A/B/X/Y buttons seem to be wearing out prematurely. Currently the A button is my most problematic and is constantly sticking. I will be contacting Razer since they back the controller for 1 year.

",3.0,demir,"Reviewed in the United States February 3, 2018","









  
  
    
  It's ok. I don't like how i feel like I have to use the extra bumpers instead of the normal bumpers. It's like the controller is designed so the normal bumpers are as unreachable as possible and you have to use the extra bumpers, and the back peddles aren't detachable, so it's uncomfortable to hold. Also, the description said ""adjustable sensitivity curve"" but what it really is, is a configurable button that makes your sensitivity super high or super low, it's not a set thing. You have to actually assign one of the extra buttons to make it fast or slow, now you can configure how high or low the sensitivity becomes when you press it, but the description failed to mention that you have to assign it. I thought it would be like the xbox elite controller, but nope. Kind of disappointed. The chroma is kinda cool. Also the a b x y buttons are way too far apart and way too far up. I got pretty big hands and my thumb just could not reach the Y button comfortably. I wish they would have lowered it and made the buttons a little closer together. The d pad is good, the thumbsticks aren't too bad either. Everything was pretty responsive, but the trigger is too smooth compared to the normal controller, and what I mean by that is that the normal xbox controller has some resistance to it, but this has none. The trigger stops also feel odd. I also don't like how the cable has a detachable part to it. I don't know why they do, but it got kind of annoying. Also if they're going to make it wired, I wish they would allow you to use other micro-usb cables instead of their own. The cable is stupid long. I think that's about it.

  Hands down one of the best controllers I've ever had the joy of putting in my hands. I was a die-hard fan of the old 360 controllers, but wanted to give the Wolverine a shot. I've had a razer huntsman for almost 2 years and have even chosen it over a much higher prices competitors version. So when I saw they employed the same switches in their controllers, I knew I had to try it.I have not been disappointed, at all.The only con I can even mention is that these are not built to handle someone with hulk hands (bad clenching issues). I got a little sweaty playing NFS heat and realized I was squeezing the hades out of the triggers, so bad I made the chassis pop. However, this is a user issue, not a manufacturing issue. If you want military grade, look elsewhere lol but this is definitely a controller meant for the serious gamer. 10/10 would and have recommended
