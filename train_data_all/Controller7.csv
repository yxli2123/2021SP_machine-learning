   Out of the box the A, X, and Y buttons are very unresponsive to anything but a perfect hard press. The A and X buttons also stick and don't come back up until unstuck. [See video]Absolutely unacceptable for a controller. Let alone a controller that costs $180.UPDATE: I received a replacement controller with the exact same issues.

  Another low quality controller from Microsoft. The thumbstick drifts brand new out of the box. The lines on the back of the controller aren't even so it feels a little different in one hand than the other. Hopefully a third party comes in and starts making Xbox controllers that function because Microsoft clearly can't figure it out.

  I might've known this would happen, have sticky buttons right out of the box! This is like the meme that happened last time, so just be cautious. The controller itself is so nice, and you can see and feel all the changes Xbox has made, but at ~$190 this is kind of PepeHands :( Too bad... time to keep replacing till you get a good copy :)Update 2 (Apr-19-2020): Started having problems with LT, turns out there are pads on the triggers themselves to be more padded and to have softer bottom out and return, and the glue happened to leak out and stick, made the trigger feel scratchy and sticky at the very top of the travel. So if there's ever something wrong with your elite triggers (since i haven't seen these on regular controllers) check to see if there's any adhesive leaking from the pads or anything on the PCB1EDIT: Support is the best, cleared up some warranty concerns that I had, went with the good 'ol Q-Tip rubbing alcohol technique! Fixed it up right away! Shame I still had to do it, but it's an easy DIY fix.

  I owned 2 of the first line of Xbox One Elite Controllers and I went through 2 of them in a year. They worked good for a few months until the rubber grips began to fail and the buttons stopped working. Right out of the package I could tell that Microsoft mad significant upgrades to the controller. It looks better and is well made! The controller is rechargeable through the case which is a pretty cool feature and there is endless customization with this controller. Strongly recommend this to any gamer and to anyone who has previously owned a XB1 Elite Conroller. Will update my review in a few months.

    This Is Inexcusable! A Button Sticks Absurdly Bad!
  
",1.0,Jonathon Lang,"Reviewed in the United States November 8, 2019","









  
  
    
  I’m not gonna lie, I was very skeptical about receiving this controller with no issues with it. I have been using only elite controllers for the past 3 years and they usually last me about 5-6 months then something happens.But, they always came ready to go when I bought them!I purchased this new series “series 2” and when it arrived I immediately opened it up and started to just do a quick check to make sure there were no problems with the controller’s functionality. Everything felt EXTREMELY AMAZING and I was so happy with the controller! But, 5 seconds later I was no longer happy and I was very upset! The reason for this was because after I pushed the A button it just stuck down into the controller?! It doesn’t do like a quick stick then pop out, I mean it literally stays completely down?!! In order to get the A button back into its normal position I have to use a very tiny flathead screwdriver to pry it out! The B button sticks pretty bad as well but not like the A button does!I would easily give this controller 5 stars if I didn’t have this nonsensical ridiculous issue to deal with. The controller’s grip is amazing, the weight is perfect, the internal charging design is awesome, the rubberized grips are amazing, and it’s so smooth to the touch! It’s to bad that I can’t enjoy it though!!! This experience has really left me very upset because I preordered this controller a while back so I was so excited when it finally came in just to only find that I can not use it!But, I went ahead and ordered 2 more immediately! They will be in tomorrow. Hopefully, they will work great and as for this one I’m going to have to send it to Microsoft I guess in order for it be fixed? I believe when you pay this amount of money on a controller to have an issue as severe as this is 100% inexcusable!! If the next two have problems I will update this review!

  I bought an Elite Series 1 when they came out.  The left bumper and right thumbstick ended up breaking with light use.  I read that they learned from their mistakes and improved this one.Less than a week in with the Series 2 and up on the D-Pad is making annoying plasticky noises, like there's a wrapper under it crunching every time I press it.

    5 hours or so of use and left analog stick is toast. Pathetic.
  
",1.0,Phil,"Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2019","UPDATE 3/15/19: I took a hiatus from gaming since November. Literally used this for maybe 5 or so hours. The left analog stick broke. It doesn't click down. Really disappointed. Thankfully I'm like a week away from my warranty. So I have to send it back. Now I'm going to have to use my original Elite controller for the time being that is over 4 years old! It's pathetic that my elite one controller still works and this one breaks.

Original review: I have been using the first elite controller for nearly the last 4 years. It still works, but it's not without it's issues about quality.

This series 2 controller has some similarities with the first edition. But there are differences as well.

1. Internal battery and case charging

Microsoft was late to the party with putting a internal rechargeable battery in a controller. And it should be a standard across all of their controllers. But it's better than using the play and charge kit. Supposedly the battery can last up to 40 hours according to microsoft.

You can also use the case as a charging dock. But you have the option to charge via the controller as well.

2. Quality and feel

The feel of the controller is better than the first. Textures grips on the triggers and where you hold it feels more comfortable for a better gaming experience. Especially when you have longer sessions.

3. Peripherals

This controller comes with the following

1. 3 sets of analog sticks
2. 2 D pads.
3. 2 sets of paddles
4. Charging case
5. Braided USB charging cable (USB C)

This controller is very flexible. The parts are very easy to swap. I would reccomend experiencing with what configuration works best for you.

4. Price point

The price is a little steep. And it's $30 more than the series one when that came out. Unfortunately I have to dock a star off for that. While there are improvements, that should be expected more than 4 years later. And you shouldn't have to pay that premium for improvements 4 years later.

More importantly, While the improvements are nice over the first edition, I don't know if it's worth it when you can find the first one at solid prices these days.

5. Connectivity and functionality

If you are a PC gamer and have a bluetooth card, say goodbye to using a wire or having to buy that Xbox USB wireless adapter that sticks out of the USB port. This controller has internal bluetooth.

You can also switch different game controller settings on the fly. Up to 3 to be exact. You can have different pre sets for multiple games. The lights on the front will indicate which one you are currently on.

Case in point, Overall solid controller. Offers incremental improvements, but nothing too groundbreaking. 4 out of 5.",

  The controller I received was a dud! With both triggers set to the lowest ""hair trigger stop"" it was not registering any input no matter what dead-zone I set within the XBOX Accessories app. The default and 2nd "" hair trigger stop"" worked fine, only the shortest one didn't work. Paying $179 for a dysfunctional controller is ridiculous! Money doesn't grow on trees!!! Come on Microsoft, why the poor QC (Quality Control)????

  Like the title of the review, I have ordered several of these and done it at different intervals in the hopes of getting controllers that are functional and not defective out of the box. Unfortunately, almost every single one of them has had an issue right off the bat and that includes a buttons that stick, triggers that don’t fully actuate correctly, motors in side that are weak and barely spin, and issues with the directional pads.  For a controller that is supposed to be there best controller offering, I’m questioning my allegiance to Microsoft going forward as I own both of the next GEN consoles and I am likely going to start making more of my purchases on the PlayStation because the controller that comes with that system in my opinion is on equal footing if not better than this piece of junk I had to buy separately. And to make matters worse, Microsoft isn’t even reachable or able to support this.Avoid at all costs!!!

  This is my first premium quality gaming controller that I've ever bought so I can't compare it to the Xbox elite series 1 or Scuff controllers.  The major advantage of these controllers for me is that I don't have to take my right thumb off of the joystick (which is used for aiming in most games) to press any of the other buttons.  This comes into play if you need to jump and aim or crouch and aim at the same time.  It sounds silly but those few milliseconds can make a difference if you're big on FPS games. I've been wanting to buy one for a while but read all about quality control issues with the elite series 1, so I figured I'd wait on this version and hope they were fixed.  So far I've been extremely impressed with just about every aspect of this controller.Pros:-Extremely simple and easy to set up button mapping.  It allows for you to assign any button to the four paddles on the back of the controller-Ergonomics: Feel is just like a regular xbox controller except that it generally feels more substantial and there are 4 paddles on the back.  They are positioned so that they are easy to press-Customization: It comes with a bunch of  different thumbsticks you can put on so you can decide what works best for you.  I like that you can adjust the tension of the thumbsticks.  I did what another reviewer recommended and increased tension then jacked up the sensitivity on my game.  This allows me to still move precisely when I need to but also look around much more quickly if I want.-Hair triggers: The triggers have customizable stops put in so you can designate both the left and right triggers as a long pull, medium pull or short pull (hair trigger).  For the hair trigger I only have to pull it very slightly to shoot which helps speed up my reaction time a bit-Battery: I've only played about 20 hours so far but the battery was still at above 50%.  Easily chargeable with your xboxCons:-Can't set up hotkeys (i.e. can't make a single press of a paddle be a double click of a different button)-Heavy, it is much heavier than a regular xbox controller due in part to the internal battery.  It doesn't both me but if that is important to you then this might not be the controller for you-Internal battery: This is a pro and con.  The battery life has been great so far but it will inevitably diminish and can't be replaced.This is where I am at after about 20 hours of playing with this thing.  I'll update a few months down the road or sooner if any issues arise

    Face Buttons Not Responsive. Button registers AFTER tactile bump...
  
",1.0,Duy,"Reviewed in the United States December 9, 2019","

   Got this for PC gaming. Love, LOVE the look and feel. Buttons feel nice and the meaty weight of it just feels right.But for a premium-priced controller, the lack of responsiveness from the face buttons is completely unacceptable. You expect a controller that works every time at bare minimum and the extra hundred bucks and change would go towards how freaking gorgeous it is. However, when I play an RPG, I let my thumb stretch out over both the X and A buttons and gently squish the A button with the middle joint of my thumb.Presses register roughly 70% of the time. If my thumb is at a certain angle, I can tap and the audible click and tactile bump happens, but the press does not register on my games or the XBox Accessories app. See video as I slightly adjust my thumb position and the controller just DOES NOT REGISTER. This has never been a problem with any controller I have ever owned, let alone one I spent $200 on. A quick search online shows I am far from alone. I am returning it until MS can sort this out.UPDATE 6/26/2020: I am exchanging a THIRD controller. They all have this issue--pull the button to the bottom left like it's a control stick. Press A. Nothing happens. Fortunately they seem to know it's a widespread issue so they are generous about replacements. Unfortunately all the replacements I've gotten have the same problem.

",1.0,Billy,"Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2019","









  
  
    
  Going to be short and to the point.First controller had button input issues meaning when you press down, it does not register or if you had to hold the button down, it wouldn’t work.Got a replacement from amazon so 2nd controller came and this one had an issue where the A button would get stuck and you’d have to try and wiggle it out.I do not recommend this controller because it has issues right out of the box. My confidence for this controller is gone. I’d wait and see how Microsoft responds because at this point, this is an expensive risk to take.I’d somewhat recommend the wolverine tournament controller. I had the Wolverine ultimate and what I like most is that it had amazing X, A, B and Y buttons. They click when you press them. My only complaints are after a few months the left stick click/pressing down on it for running in most games stop being as responsive so you had to press it a few and if you play games like for honor and you have to press the right bumper and trigger at the same time, it takes a lot of finesse to actually achieve the button press simultaneously. So to reiterate, get the tournament, not the ultimate unless you absolutely need the headphone adapter on it but even then I don’t recommend since the extra mapable buttons on the back are kinda hard to reach and very impractical with the button style they went with. I think the tournament has less buttons but they are easier to reach. Anyways, best of luck.

  Both controllers I've received had sticky A buttons which, when pressed with the side of my thumb, do not register half the time. I really have to press the A button (the most important button) hard to get it to register. I am on my second controller now  and both did this straight out of the box. I will get a third controller but if it happens again, I'm getting a refund. It's a shame because I do love the usb-c connector, rechargeable battery, grips and tremendous weight to this thing. But if it's going to eat my inputs, it is completely worthless to me and Microsoft doesn't deserve a penny from me over it.

",2.0,Mike,"Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  Let me preface this by saying that I had the Xbox Elite Series 1 controller. It was my favorite gaming controller I had ever used for about 2 years, until the day the piece of plastic that anchors the left bumper to the central hub of the controller broke. After doing some research online, it seems that was a common issue for people. Rather than buy a replacement or try to repair it myself, I went back to my standard controller, as rumors of the Elite Series 2 had started floating around, so I figured I'd grab one when they came out.I finally got myself the Elite Series 2 two months ago (end of May). I love this controller, much like I loved the Series 1. I wanted it to last. But in the last week, both of the slides for the trigger locks have broken. More specifically, the ""nub""/""tab"" (not sure what to call it) that you use to slide up and down to the different lock levels, has snapped on both sides. I've included pictures here, though it's a little difficult to capture (and my camera was finicky with focusing in on them). There is still about half of the ""nub""/""tab"" left on either side - enough that if I use my finger nail I can catch it and slide it still (we'll see if the rest eventually breaks off?). Occasionally during play my fingers will brush by them now and feel the sharp edge where they snapped, or the sharp point at the end (previously rounded off).Let me say that I rarely used the trigger locks on the Series 1, and with the Series 2 I had move the right trigger lock to the lowest level early on and left it there, and not touched either lock since (i.e. never used the left trigger lock). This would be an issue for anyone I'd think, especially if you used the trigger locks or adjusted their levels frequently. However, it's especially baffling to me because I basically never touch them. My fingers don't rest on them during normal play. I am the only person in the house who uses/touches the controller. I'm very careful/gentle with it, I don't feel that I particularly put a lot of wear and tear on my accessories. I still have my Xbox One Day One edition controller that is in great condition. Last night after finishing up a play session, I unplugged my headset and went to charge the controller for the night, and as I leaned in toward the charger I heard a piece clatter to the table - the left trigger lock nub (the right one broke off in similar fashion about a week ago). I hadn't used or touched the trigger locks all night, and in fact had never used the left one.Admittedly this doesn't prevent me from using the controller, because as I've laid out I almost never adjust the trigger locks, and there is still a shard of the tab left that allows me to move them if I need to. Still. Microsoft is charging nearly $200 for this controller. It's supposed to be made out of premium parts/materials. It comes with a very limited warranty (I believe 3 months?). Going through their support only allows you to chat with a bot if you choose accessory support, and your only option is to send the controller off to a depot for repair. This review isn't specifically about Microsoft's warranty coverage or support options, but I feel like people should be aware of the full picture if these controllers are going to start falling apart in under two months, when gently used. I haven't knocked it all the way to 1 star because prior to the trigger locks breaking, I loved the controller. It feels premium. It's comfortable, it's weighty in a good way, the carrying case with built in charging dock is awesome, there are plenty of swappable accessory options, etc. But it's hard to recommend when you may not have long to enjoy all of the good bits before it falls apart.

  I've got to say I'm extremely satisfied with newly improved Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller.Here's my impression:-There's no more click when moving thumbsticks-Rubber Grip Texture feels more comfortable and sturdy which doesn't feel loose anymore as compared to Xbox Elite 1 Controller which many customers had problem with loose rubber grip in the past.-I'm glad that they add Mini and Medium Paddles to prevent accidental click-The R-Trigger and L-Trigger including distinct texture grip feels comfortable, even if my hands get sweaty over time, it is still smooth, responsive, and comfortable-USB C Connection was a huge plus for me since I hate micro USB cable.-It supports Bluetooth and Wireless capability (as long as you have Xbox Wireless Adapter connected on your PC/Console).-It comes with six interchangeable thumb sticks: 2x Standard, 2x Classic, and 1x Tall and 1x Wide Dome Thumbsticks-I have no issue with unresponsive, sticky buttons. Perhaps I got extremely lucky that my Elite 2 Controller works flawlessly!When it comes to price, yes it's going to cost nearly $200 but nevertheless, you pay what you get. All in all, I highly recommend Xbox Elite Series 2 Controller!

  UPDATED: 1/2/2020So trying to keep this as short as possible, I have owned 4 Original Elite Controllers - 2 of them replaced under warranty - So lets call that 6 Original Elite controllers. 2 of them I had to scrap for parts as they were out of warranty and become part of my parts supply to keep the others going. Other than the know issues I still liked those controllers.Now lets move on to the Elite 2 - I have now owned 2 of them about to be 3 as I have seen the following:First Purchased Elite 2 - Buttons sticking - A and sometimes B - But worse are the BT disconnects that seem to happen when the unit is plugged in and charging. (Clearly an issue as there is no removable battery). Note: I hate the grip material its way too slippery when compared to the original elite. I wish I could fix that in some way. It does not look like it will support aftermarket grips but maybe that would solve it. At least for me my hands physically hurt after playing for a few hours due to needing to grip the controller way harder than I had been used too. So that is a strange side effect I have found.**Two side notes, I think shipping it with vibration on for a controller that has no removable battery might be taxing the reported play hours per charge, also somewhere needs to be talked about if you use a chatpad and how might power that also can draw**So in trying to return the first elite to amazon they sent me a new unit for the swap - This unit at first would not pair with the console. I have seen these issues before on controllers in general, but got that working and it needed the normal update to firmware. This was done and no issues. Re-booted everything and all was working. Went to install my chatpad and nothing, it will not show up on the accessories app, it will not light up, it does nothing. Re-attached it to my other elite 2 before I ship it back for credit and it works fine?So I guess I am very concerned at the reliability of these quite expensive controllers. I have heard rumor that MS is working on this, possibly a software update etc. It is very strange how it reacts when attached to power for charging, and the buttons sticking is clearly a not great issue. I have heard rumors about stick drift issues persisting but I have not seen those personally.I guess I am checking to see how wide spread this might be and also to make sure that what I am experiencing is possibly Alpha Ring related for the software or possibly Firmware issues, as clearly the ring does not effect the buttons sticking etc I assume that is simply a hardware issue.--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I have been looking forward to this controller since the 6 I have bought in the last few years all have failed in different ways. Grips falling off. Control stick drift and upper button failures due to non robust design.So far in using this controller I have found a couple undesirable issues and some nice redesigned items but right now the undesirable ones are bad enough to make the use experience less than fantastic.#1 is the new grip material is in one word slippery as ice and is actually so slippery that it is causing my hands to go numb as you need to hold onto the controller much harder due to the slippery grips. I put aftermarket grips on my original elites and they worked and felt great.#2 is the upper vibration motors are loud to the point of annoying and honestly just do not give the high quality feel I would expect for the very expensive price of this controller. I have just turned them off but the lower motors seems to sound and feel better much like the older version.I have not had it long enough to determine if the integrated battery is going to hold up or if the other redesigned items last for any long term but as a user that has been through many controllers and rebuilt several elite controllers I can only hope those items are actually fixed. But time will tell.

It has a nice weight and feels durable.The fatal problem, for me at least, is that I purchased this for the same reason I purchased the series one: I have large hands, and the long thumb-sticks are much more comfortable for me. Using the short thumb-sticks makes my hands cramp after a while.  And this controller only comes with one (1) long thumb-stick, instead of two(2) like the series 1.  I am shocked and upset, this thing is priced ridiculously and it fails its primary purpose.  Why the one long stick?  Is that for the swarms of people with asymmetrical hands?No problem, thought I, I will use the extra thumb-stick from my series 1 (for my second large hand)...except they aren't interchangeable.  Thanks, Microsoft, for another product that doesn't quite work.

  Feels very premium. Would love it if it had functioned properly.Unfortunately a controller that feels and looks premium is only worth this price if the buttons actually work. The A button only registers a press if you either press it with much greater force or about half the time if you press it normally.Disappointing. Will be contacting either Amazon or Microsoft for either a replacement or refund.

  I've preordered two of these, both had problems with the A button not always registering.I decided to use one of the controllers for a few days, hoping the A button responsiveness would improve with use. It didn't. More so, during this short period of use, it developed a creaking sound in the right trigger (with triggers set to the shallowest hair-trigger setting).I ordered replacement controllers and... they have the same issue: A button presses do not always register! It's a shame, because otherwise the controllers look and feel really, really nice.At this point I am thinking the A button problem is is either a design flaw or a pervasive production issue (such as a defect in the A button plastic molding/membrane/circuit board printing). Irrespective of the cause, I believe it's unlikely for the problem to be fixed in the next few months, so I am returning the replacement controllers and reluctantly rating the controller 1 star.For the skeptic: I am not new to gaming - I've been gaming on various consoles and computer systems for over 30 years. I developed games for 7 years, in my early career. I am not imagining/overstating this issue. If you need a controller in which the A button works reliably, these ones are not it.

  I own two of these controllers and they both have issues. The first controller has a problem with the left hair trigger lock and the ""X"" and ""A"" buttons get stuck on the second controller after pressing it a few times. These controllers were clearly rushed in production. I recommend waiting a few months for a different batch or until they fix these problems. The controller feels premium but doesn't work like a premium product. Compared the first gen Xbox elite controller the design is much improved.

Sadly, the second one was even worse.  You'd push the A button and it would just stick in.  Returning for now and hoping they get it all sorted out and try again later.

    Controller is Great, hoping the flaws of v1 elite have been fixed
  
",5.0,Jennifer Buck,"Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  This is my third elite controller (had 2 version 1 elites) my biggest issue with my first two elites was the rubber grips coming off and I had some stick drift as well. I never had the issue of broken bumpers that I saw other people have with their v1 elites but Im hoping that is something they also addressed with this new controller. Obviously having this controller only for one day I can't really say if the new designed grips on this controller will hold up but im hoping they do. The New design to the grips do feel good tho.First thing about this controller I noticed is that it is slightly smaller than the version 1 (this could be something microsoft already mentioned when they announced the version 2 im not sure). Since it slightly smaller it also has a little less weight but it still has that weightiness that the version 1 has just very slightly less.The back paddle are also smaller and do not extend as much as the v1 paddle, which I think is ultimately a good thing but it will take maybe 30mins/hour to get use to the smaller paddles if you are use to the v1 paddles. The bumpers and triggers are also smaller but it still feels normal.Also the thumbsticks of the v1 controller are NOT compatiable with the v2 controller. And that is because the v2  has the new tension adjusting mechanic in the stick, so the thumbsticks themselves have new designs. As for the thumbstick that come with the controller: 2 short concave stick (smooth on the top surface but having a textured mesh-like on the sides like the typical v1 sticks), 1 short convex/dome stick with a textured patterned, 2 short wide surface concave sticks, 1 long concave stick (essentially the same as the v1 long concave stick). Im currently using the 2 short wide surface stick as I like the extra surface area of the sticks.It comes with long USB-C charging cable too and has a slot to insert the USB-C cord into to charge the controller on a charging dock that is inside case but of course you can just connect the USB cord directly to the controller to charge and play at the same time which is probably the way most of us will charge the controller but still a nice feature nonetheless.Only con I would have is my X button feels a bit stickier/stiffer than the A,B,Y buttons but im hoping that goes away as press the X more and more.I will say this controller is overall better than the v1 from design to feel to look but If you have a v1 elite already and are not suffering from the grips, stick drift. or broken button issues then you probably dont need to upgrade unless the tension stick adjusting and more button config profile, other things the v1 dont have are very important to you. Unfortunately only time will tell if the grips/drift issues have been solved.

  This is the only premium controller I’ve ever purchased. I decided it would make a good birthday present to myself. Sadly I’m returning the controller due to the “A” button not registering being pressed consistently. I’ve done all the troubleshooting steps. I’ve updated the firmware. I’ve played with it the last 2 days, and if anything it’s getting worse.This being Microsoft, they’ll work out the kinks eventually...? I tried to exchange it through Xbox support and was disconnected, so I’m getting a refund and might try again in a year.  I’ve been an Xbox gamer for 14+ years and I’ve learned being an early adopter is hit or miss. For the price you would think it was thoroughly tested before being shipped.As for the controller it does feel premium. The rubberized grip is nice, but takes getting used to. The battery is a beast, and after playing for 2 days it was still registering almost full. ( I don’t like the idea of not being able to replace it. It worries me that Microsoft doesn’t have a plan in place for this.) The weight was balanced and I got used to it pretty quickly. The adjustable triggers was something I’ve never used before. I’ve been playing a lot of Borderlands 3, and not having to pull the triggers all the way down was definitely a plus.My opinion would be to wait until the issues are worked out.

   It’s a nice controller, but hopefully Microsoft has fixed the design flaws from the first generation Elite controllers. Either way, Microsoft is still only willing to provide a ‘limited 90 day warranty‘ for these controllers, so here’s hoping for the best.It seems like they’ve changed the rubber grips quite a bit so hopefully these grips won’t slowly expand and come unglued like they did on my previous Elite. The trigger grips are also a nice addition.I’m a bit skeptical over the built-in, non replaceable battery, but the charging puck is nice since it doesn’t turn on the Xbox when you dock it. The charging puck is also heavy enough that it tends to stay on the table instead of being lifted when you pick up the controller.I also appreciate that they used USB-C. (For the person saying they’re missing the cable, it’s under the packaging the zipper case rests on in the box. It’s well hidden.)

    Buyer Beware!
  
",1.0,Koji C. Ebersole,"Reviewed in the United States June 6, 2020","Do not buy this controller without a thorough understanding of the questionable durability of this product.

Elite Controller Series 1 has several very well documented design flaws. Simply search Amazon for Elite Controller Replacement, and you will find a whole cottage industry of replacement bumpers to address the most common flaw. Replacements for rubber grips falling off, replacement analog sticks for stick drift are other well documented but less frequent problems, that have replacement parts that can be purchased third party.

The problems with series 1 were not related to misuse.

Eventually, in response to widespread community complaint, Microsoft opened up their replacement policy. Rightfully so. The controller durability required it.

Therefore, it was with great fanfare that series 2 was released, with reported attention to each of these systemic issues.

The update was met with near universal praise. The early going was fantastic.

Unfortunately, the cat is now out of the bag. Worldwide the controller is less than 1 year old, being only released last October. And now the plethora of durability issues are again becoming evident.

The most frequently documented is ""bumper double clicking"" and ""A button (or face button) sticking."" Less frequent are complaints again reporting stick drift, and problems with bluetooth connectivity.

Unfortunately, I have not been spared these concerns. Several weeks ago, I began to experience the right bumper double clicking. Within several days, the problem progressed to involve the left bumper. Within a week, the right bumper would not register anymore.

I do not misuse my equipment, and the total hours of use low.

An internet search for Elite 2 problems will quickly identify that these shortcomings are once again systemic, and the number of persons affecting is growing on a daily basis.

A formal press release was published by Microsoft in November confirming hardware problems affecting gamers. There has been no formal follow up since that admission.

Once you experience these durability issues, which unfortunately I expect you will, you will find yourself seeking recourse.

When you follow the standard microsoft/xbox online support mechanisms, you will find that, unless the controller is within 90 days of purchase, your efforts will be fruitless. At the end of the process, you will receive an email that simply states the product is out of the replacement window. No other recourse will be offered.

90 days for a $180 device? This is not acceptable you will think.

Flabbergasted, you will be compelled to pursue the issue further. However, you will find thereafter, that it is not possible to speak to a live representative from microsoft about this problem. It is not possible. You will reach a dead end anyway you turn.

Eventually, if you continue to be frustrated enough at the perceived injustice to continue, you might find that, to connect to a live person, you have to pretend you have a different problem. If you pretend for example, that you would like to end your subscription to xbox live, you will then receive a call back from a live person. That person will be of no help, because they are on the software side, and your problem is hardware related. They state however, that they will transfer you to the hardware side. The connection may or may not go through. However, if you are persistent enough going through this side channel, you may eventually be connected to hardware support.

Support will state that they are aware of the problem, and ""a ticket has been sent to the back end team.""

What does that mean? you will ask. The response is repeated by the support team ""a ticket has been sent to the back end team.""

Doesn't this solve your concern? Is this response not self explanatory? Are you not satisfied?

Of course not. There is no time table provided. There is no mechanism for follow-up provided. No fix provided. No assurance that anything will happen at all. Meanwhile, you will find yourself with a $180 paper weight.

To be clear, this controller was 5/5 out of the box. Having owned multiple series 1, I preordered series 2 with tremendous excitement, and my early use was fantastic.

But this durability, or lack thereof, is unacceptable. The series 1, despite the numerous short comings, had community fixes for just about every concern. Users like myself learned the repair process, and kept their devices working.

There is no known fix for series 2. We are 100% dependent on Microsoft being forthright and honest, and taking care of their customers. That is not going well.

$180 for 6 months of use is unacceptable.

This controller gets 1/5 stars. Buyer beware.

(I will update this review if Microsoft responds to their community and corrects these systemic issues)",

  I've been a fairly avid gamer most of my life, and made the transition to using the Xbox at age 13. Until turning 23, I have only used stock controllers and relatively cheaper variants due to being young. At this point in my life, I can comfortably afford to spend more money on more premium products for that enhanced quality. Three and a half months ago, I made this decision for my console gaming experience when I bought this controller. My qualms are not so much with the controller's amenities but rather the longetivity.The ergonomics of the controller itself are great. It has a textured grip to improve handling of the controller, interchangeable joysticks and D-pads, paddles to increase variability to your gaming, adjustments to trigger pull for the FPS junkies out there, and a plethora of options for customizing what buttons do in the Accessories App. You can even use one button like a SHIFT key on your keyboard, allowing for even more options. I thoroughly enjoy using this controller as I learned to use the paddles. The paddles by default replace the ""A,"", ""B,"", ""X,"" and ""Y"" buttons. This addition allows you to play games without having to move your thumbs with the exception of the D-pad, Start/Select buttons, and Xbox button. For someone really into FPS, this increases your efficiency by a notable amount once it is learned. I had a fantastic time using this controller when I gamed in my free time, until the drift came.My controller's left joystick has drift on its Y-Axis. What a controller should do once you release the joystick is return to the center. This keeps your character from moving when you do not intend for them to do so. What my controller does is keep the joystick tilted ever so slightly up or down, keeping my character moving in that direction when gaming and making it a hell of a challenge to select anything with an in-game cursor. I will use Apex Legends as an example. I jump onto a narrow ledge to make use of its elevation and I have a sniper with a scope. While aimed in, I make a slight movement up to see just a bit better. Next thing I know, I am falling off of that ledge to likely 50m below, where there were some enemies sneaking by and now I am dead. That slight movement of my character without my intent will cause issues like that to happen on a constant. The problem is even worse when I need to ping to my team for ammo, a certain attachment, or even to drop an item in my inventory. When accessing your inventory in Apex, you use a circular in-game cursor and move it with your joystick to individual items. Imagine how hard that becomes when my cursor keeps going up/down unless I take extra time to steady the stick to the center. That seemingly small problem impairs gameplay to the point I almost don't even use the controller and use a stock controller instead.I had actually never had joystick drift until getting an Elite Controller. Due to various reasons, I have been very busy these past few months, making me forgetful or at times unable to contact Microsoft, I got to contacting them this week for help as I did not want to void any warranty trying to fix a nearly $200 controller on my own. However, in a timely manner, I get a response telling me I can't be helped as I am past my warranty. I bought this controller on the 9th of February and got this response today, on the 27th of May. Not even 4 months past the purchase of this item, Microsoft will refuse to provide any help. Now I am hoping I can get some results from AMEX as I bought this controller with that card for an extended coverage of the item. If you buy this, be extremely careful with it, try to clean it, and do what you can to prevent development of a problem down the line as Microsoft will only stand by a nearly $200 controller for 90 days.

  I've had two of these controllers. I've treated them with the upmost respect and security, making sure to never bang them on anything. I was incredibly gentle with them, and yet both of my controllers have broken within a single month.The main issue that this controller has is the same issue that normal Xbox One X controllers have. They have terribly made sticks. You will experience stick drift within a week or two of use, and it will annoy you like crazy. There is no fix for this drift, and it will continue to get worse with time.Likewise, for some reason, these controllers also have weak switches on the back. These switches are incredibly fragile and are made out of incredibly cheap materials. It is very embarrassing how Microsoft continues to attempt to milk their loyal gaming community by dishing out cheap, poorly made products.While the controller worked, it was amazing. Sadly, the controllers did not work for long, and I was able to get refunds for them.

  Good controller.  I’ve had two of the first generation Elites.  The bumper trigger broke on the first one (lasted a bit more than two years) and the rubber grip pads eventually fell off.  Bought a second one (used) and got 6 months before the rubber grip pads started falling off.  (Not complaining, but these earlier versions definitely had some issues.)This one is the second generation and I like it.  The grips feel different - more secure and hopefully less likely to come loose.The internal rechargeable battery is cool.  It “clicks” magnetically with the charger and I really like that.The bumper triggers have three settings for depth of trigger pull - as opposed to two on the older version.  I like that too and set it into the middle.  Deep enough I feel it, but not so deep it causes problems in quick reactions.The metal button flippers on the bottom feel tighter - much better than the ones on the earlier version.  The old ones would sometimes work themselves loose during heated PvP for me.  These ones on the new controller just feel more “snug.”All in all, I can tell engineers paid attention and worked through a lot of old issues.  Definitely a good purchase for me.  (As a 40-something professional who plays Overwatch on the weekends, I need all the help I can get.)

  I went through two of the original Elite controllers and both of them eventually had grips that fell apart and even worse deadzone issues and drift. I really love the way the elite feels so I kept going back to it and I'm at the point now where I rely on the extra paddles so moving back to a regular controller is very difficult for me. I was hopeful that the v2 would be an improvement and so far it definitely has been almost everywhere. The charge works great and lasts a very long time. The paddles have been shortened and feel way better which is weird because I didn't think that was something that needed to be improved. The grip is worse but feels more durable so I can live with that. I love the fact I can store an additional profile and a default setting. I also like the tension you can put on the sticks. I use the default tension, but it's great that is an option. Overall this feels like a really solid improvement. I've used it for a month now without any issues. In my mind they should get a minimum of 2 years out of heavy play, and v1 only lasted me about 9 months each time (which is terrible), so we'll have to wait and see how it holds up.

    Best controller I've used... until stick drift
  
",2.0,Thing with a hook,"Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2021","









  
  
    
  5 stars for the controller itself: it feels great and I like how the paddles feel better than the comparable Scuf controller. While the new Series X controllers have imported some of the improvements (texture on the grips and on the triggers), the elite has a satisfying heft to it. I feel like you could defend yourself from a home invasion wielding one of these, and if anyone discovers how much you have spent on just a controller they may also think you have priceless jewelry or artwork waiting to be plundered so perhaps that's a real risk. Also: paddles are great for some games.Now to take away 3 stars: I only managed to get through one game before the controller began failing. For the record, the full game was Jedi: Fallen Order, not an experience that seemed inordinately demanding on the left controller. And I will say I very much enjoyed remapping the force push and pull to the paddles.Alas, I then started playing Dark Souls 3. About half way through my character began spontaneously walking forwards at inopportune moments. Yes, controller drift (on the left stick) had struck. This got progressively more severe until the controller was unusable. In case you're wondering, at no point had I thrown the controller around in the midst of rage quitting out of a troublesome boss: under those circumstances I just summon help, like the massive scrub I am. Yes, I pressed up on the controller a lot, but that's *a lot* of games that make you do that.This sadly doesn't seem to be an isolated problem. I find it odd that this should be happening to so many people seeing Microsoft have ample experience producing perfectly serviceable and (in my experience) robust normal XBox controllers. It's also really expensive compared to those controllers. I want to say ""you get what you pay for"", but obviously you don't. The Scuf controller I bought to replace this, while not feeling quite as fancy, has also held up much better.The only reason this review isn't one star is because if it fails as quickly for you as it did for me, it should still be covered by some sort of warranty so at least you might not be completely out of luck. In general, like an OLED TV and the fear of burn-in, this seems like one of those rare times you actually do want to take advantage of an extended warranty if it's available to you, for the peace of mind. If you are super price-sensitive you probably aren't considering this controller anyway, so consider the added expense as just the cost of doing business for that sweet paddle action.So despite my paltry two star review, I would actually consider buying this again with a suitable extended warranty. Am I an idiot? Don't answer that.

  Random connection drops and sync issues when using bluetooth.  Disconnects happen randomly - mid game the controller looses sync with the PC host and the light blinks.  At the same time the Bluetooth stack on Windows 10 seems to cause your game to pause/stutter/lock, and if you're lucky it will restore itself automatically.  If you're not lucky you completely lose Bluetooth and have to hit the Xbox button to re-sync bluetooth.If you're using it wired, works great.

",2.0,John H,"Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I thought that paying $170 for a controller would give me a quality product, unfortunately this controller just like it's previous counterparts have an inherit issue, that would be the thumb sticks. From the basic controller to this one it's only a matter of time of when they will start to drift without being touched. The warranty on this unit expired in May of this year and the drift started in June. Best part is Microsoft will be more than happy to replace the unit for only $99 plus tax. So in less then 5 months I have paid over $270 for an ""Elite"" controller. Honestly the price does not at all justify the few frills of programmable paddles and adjustable triggers and sticks. Not for the durability of the product. Also I'm not a young kid, I'm in my 50's and I did not abuse the controller at all. It is a known issue that you would expect not to occur on something with a hefty price tag and the ""elite"" monicker.

    The A button has a chance to be faulty
  
",1.0,Vern,"Reviewed in the United States November 12, 2019","









  
  
    
  Tried two different controllers and both had an issue with the A button not registering inputs.  You notice this quickly in any game that relies on it a lot and it's frustrating to the point that the controller is unusable.  After searching I found on reddit that this is quite a common problem among others.  If you gamble on getting one of these just be prepared you may have to return it which thankfully is easy with Amazon.

    Known Issue: Right Bumper Double Click
  
",1.0,Mirela,"Reviewed in the United States July 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  I noticed the issue a few months into use - light use ( I am 27 Y/O and take care of my devices). Recently I noticed pressing the right bumper every 3-4 clicks it registered twice. A small issue but something that happens frequently enough and is frustrating for a premium product.I have tested this on multiple devices both plugged in and via Bluetooth - I also tested my standard Xbox one controller and the issue is not present.Reviewing many forums this is a KNOWN issue and something Microsoft is simply providing warranty support on. However, because I noticed my issue months into use I am out of warranty and would need to pay $100 to get thid fixed.More to the point, many people who have received replacement units are still experiencing the issue. This is not a one-off and is a systemic ISSUE with the product. UNACCEPTABLE!!!! For such an expensive product I could not be more disappointed, and because the issue did not present right away I am SOL.I would NOT recommend this product and go with a series 1 for now.

  My A, B, X, Y were sticky, mostly from the sides & I disliked the noise it made. The input didn't register randomly a few times but I think its fine now, it seems like it's been working better after some heavy use, no more stickiness. I also recommend cleaning your controllers buttons with green cleaner from Trader Joes or something similar, it'll help a bit, don't spray directly on it though.The controller doesn't reconnect to bluetooth after plugging it into pc, then unplugging it. It seems like a small thing until you're in a game, you plug it in, play for awhile, unplug & completely lose connection to the PC, having to hit the windows button, blah blah blah to disconnect, reconnect it all over again. Its not a huge issue, just something to remember!The analog sticks look the same internally (I saw a disassembly video on YT) i'm nervous about those & the bumpers, etc. This controller does have HUGE improvements but my biggest concern is whether they cheaped out again on parts. My biggest disappointment was the bumpers & the analog sticks failing on my original Elite series 1. I bought two Elites, this is my third, technically my 1st Elite series 2, I will not be buying a 2nd Elite after this because we beta tested the first model, this was their 1 shot, i put a lot of effort into what i wanted to see changed in the 1st model, they definlity heard us as gamers, i feel like they did a good job! I don't like the minor issues but I think it's completely worth it at 180 bucks. I love this controller, it's freaking SWEET.

  So, first thing I have to say is for the love of dog, wash/cleanyour hands before using this controller. The matte finish will grab onto the oils in your fingers/hands and will leave the controller with obvious smudges and smears. They should have included a microfiber cloth in the box.Ok now that that is out of the way. My initial impressions.1. This thing is a BEAST! In its mass amount of features and functions yes, but even more so in its sheer weight!  This thing arrive in an amazon box not much bigger than the box for the controller itself, and when I picked it up I though they had sent me some kind of small anvil instead.2. Initial impressions of this one in terms of build quality are positive. I will update this section in a month or two. For reference, I owned the original elite controller and have replaced the grips multiple times (eventually with Sugru, which has been the most permanent solution I’ve found) replaced the shoulder buttons at least three times that I can remember, replaced the ribbon cable (that was my fault). It also developed issues with the rumble motors.3. The features mentioned in the description all work as promised as far as I can tell. I will update this section over time if issues arise. If you want to be able to quickly find this review in the future, be mark it as helpful so I will be pinned on the main product page.4. One of my favorite new features for this addition is the combination carrying/charging case. I have the charger in the carrying case, connected to my usb hub via the included USB-C cable, sitting open on the coffee table.  When the controller needs a charge I just place it in the case and it locks right in place with a noticeable vibration feedback confirmation that it’s connected.The one thing I dislike about this new version is the stress from waiting for something/anything to go wrong. It’s honestly too good to be true, especially after the experience I had with V1.If you have any questions about the controller, or about other comparisons to the original elite, leave a comment and I will get back to you

  Absolutely love the feel of this new controller.  Everything is an upgrade from the original Elite controller.  Unfortunately, it seems like its plagued by issues with the buttons.  I on my second controller after the first one had two buttons that wouldnt register half of the time.  Right out of the box, the A and X buttons were hit and miss.  Now my second controller has started having issues with the A button not registering if you hit it from certain angles.  Its really disappointing considering the price and issues the first Elite had.If you must buy, I would also purchase a long warranty because this first batch seems plagued with issues.

",5.0,V4N6U4RD,"Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  With normal controllers, I have to add adhesive grips, custom thumbstick caps, and rechargeable battery packs...Not with the Xbox Elite Series 2...I was able to select my prefered Thumbsticks, Back Padels, and customize my own profile, pretty much out of the box and all Windows 10 Downloads were free as well as under 10mb downloads. When So many features were well executed I am confident in giving 5 stars.Some users have reported using blue-tooth (because you can) with the Xbox Accessories App and that combination bricked their controller after the firmware update...I've mainly used the Xbox Wireless Adapter, and I've only ever needed 1 update. I have not experienced any problems...so I am able to give 5 starsWhile I do not ""need"" the Bluetooth connection, I have used it when I needed it and it worked well, so I have to consider it as a plus. When all connectors needed to utilize the charger dock are all included and I need no additional purchases to obtain additional features it's made for good user experiences. Thankfully the entire kit comes in a premium zipper-enclosed carrying case (better than a bag), with specialized sockets for each component, so it's easy to stay organized (even when on-the-go)...Fully justified in rating 5 stars.When playing games, it works pretty much the same as a normal Xbox One controller, but feels so much better...kind of like sitting in a much nicer chair or looking a sharper and cleaner display. It can't offer a competitive advantage, but it will provide a lot more comfort. so the final rating is 5 stars

  I hope people will see this review, this is my first one and I don't know how this works.DON'T BUY THISI have owned plenty of Xbox 360 and Xbox 1 controllers and I have only had ONE break. It was a 360 controller that saw 3 years of constant use.(totally understandable why it wore down.)Now I work full time I don't play videogames much anymore, but I thought why not buy a fancy controller? It's compatable for the next Xbox and it's USBC. sounds great...Less than 6 months of light use, the controller is already broken.The left bumper will not register or it will double click. The retention spring inside is still fully functional, no part physically broke. It just does not register.The left stick also drifts now unless you set the stick to the heaviest torque setting. That is easy to set, but it now limits how you use that stick.I can't express how frustrating it is to buy a controller THREE TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE than a standard controller, just to break when it has barely been used.It's advertised as high quality. It is not.EDIT: I took apart the controller after realizing I couldn't get a refund. And I found a fix for the bumper. The bumper has a small, frail piece of plastic buffering where the bumper strikes the actual button. I took that out and replaced it with a slightly thicker piece of plastic cut out from an ordinary water bottle. After a little fiddling it works perfectly. Now it works, however my controller is a little jacked up from prying it open.

    Junk - they still can't make a reliable Elite controller
  
",1.0,Bucky,"Reviewed in the United States January 4, 2020","









  
  
    
  The original Elite had well documented durability issues, which Microsoft promised they'd taken care of with the second revision. Which, I suppose, they did. Unfortunately, they managed to introduce some new ones. After 2 months of use, the A button on my controller became intermittent. Moving your thumb around on the button, while depressed, would cause input interruptions, and that's IF the button press registered in the first place. The A button also liked to stick, just a bit, during release. The B button was also exhibiting similar issues, though less frequently.But wait, there's more! Of the four rear paddles, one lost it's tactile 'click' after about a day, though in fairness, it always worked. That same paddle also had issues with retention; it would regularly pop away from the controller after being released.The controller has been returned for Amazon credit. I don't even want a replacement. This is the second generation Elite, for $180, NONE of these issues are acceptable. I've gone back to my Xbox One controller, which survived a Sekiro playthrough and still works great.

    Quality Issues - Bumper Buttons
  
",1.0,Fondu,"Reviewed in the United States June 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have been gaming for 30 years, I have countless controllers from all eras of gaming and have never once broken a controller. Had this controller for 6 months and now the RB button barely registers. I have to press very firmly for it to work. Absolutely embarrassing quality. Numerous complaints about the bumpers for this thing, and out of warranty as they only provide 90 days. $190 pile of garbage. It astounds me that a button can go bad on a controller that costs this much money.I even called Microsoft to see if they'd acknowledge the issue and they guy on the line said there is actually a class action lawsuit against this controller, but it's for stick drift not the LB/RB issues (even though those are prevalent too). Regardless, what was his solution? Pay MS $50 and they'll fix it. Yeah that's what I want to do, throw good money after bad. The controller has a design flaw at it's core, it'll just go bad again.I looked up self repair options as well, opened the controller myself to find that the LB and RB buttons have extremely cheaply made thin pieces of plastic that wear with use. I put a tiny piece of electrical tape on the top of the one by the RB to help, and it helped a little bit, but this thing still performs worse than a crappy PowerA controller I got for my Nintendo Switch when playing a game that requires a lot of RB inputs like Enter the Gungeon or Zen Pinball.Ultimately, I have to dedicate a back paddle to RB inputs, and thus also re-train my brain just to make it functional. Frankly I only do it as to not feel entirely cheated out of buying this thing when I could be using my PS4 controllers or 8-bitdo ones I have lying around. I am a stubborn one that's for sure.Don't waste your money, don't buy this.

  Controller worked fine at first, no sticky buttons, rumble was responsive and crisp, and connected fine via bluetooth and dongle. Fast forward to the most recent firmware update, dongle (old version and new) as well as USB connection are borked and the controller is not detected via windows USB adapter or direct USB connection, and Xbox accessories confirms this. Connects fine to PC via bluetooth, but cannot be configured or customized that way. It also connects natively to Xbox One X and is detected and configurable. Microsoft fix your issue so that I dont have to travel back and forth between Xbox and PC to use the functionality that I paid an extra premium to have.This is now a bluetooth only controller for PC due to your most recent firmware.

  Disappointed by this controller.I've been an original elite controller user since it was released.  I know people have had issues with it but i've had it for several years and its been great (and still is).  For me one of its big weaknesses was the paddles.  They were too easy to press and didn't feel comfortable.  I addressed it with an addon (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B06XCVSMWM/ref=ppx_od_dt_b_asin_title_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).What attracted me to the elite 2 was1) ability to just place the controller onto the base and its always charged when you need it.2) updated paddle design3) additional profile available4) tension adjustable thumb sticksAll of those were nice features and in practice were well done.Design wise, what I found not so good about the elite 2 controller were the grips.  The ones on the original elite controller were much better for me.  The new ones felt less grippy.  Also, the bluetooth connectivity to my pc's onboard bluetooth was terrible (my other devices work fine).  I had to dig out my pc adapator for xbox controllers which worked fine.I could live with the items above. but what finally made me return the controller was the dpad and the a button.  For the dpad to register the right direction i would have to press it hard on the right top corner (using the plus or removing the plus and going directly against it).  The a button had to be pressed with force to get it register.  The click you get when you press the button sometimes was not enough.  I didn't bother getting a replacement after seeing so many people with issues similar to mine.  I'm hoping Microsoft corrects these issues in a revision and then Ill think about it again.

",1.0,Richard Avirett,"Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've had my Xbox One S2 Elite since launch day. Here are some important things to know about it:1) A small number come with joystick drift out of the box. Your recourse is warranty replacement.2) A larger, but still small number come with sticky buttons out of the box. Same recourse.3) If you plan to use it on anything other than a console (i.e a PC) plan on using it wired. A very large percentage of them develop bluetooth connectivity issues eventually. Dropped sync and massive frame hitching when it happens. There are no firmware fixes, warranty is your only recourse.Yes, the feel of it in your hands is one of quality. It's heavy and the paddles / sticks / dpad are metal. The battery is internal but lasts long enough I haven't had it die on me. The trigger stops are amazing for FPS games or others that don't need 2 inches of analog control. But the warranty kills the entire experience.The above wouldn't be terrible if the warranty support wasn't utterly lacking. You get 90 days to find issues and report them to support for a replacement. There is no guarantee that what you receive as replacement will not have the exact same issues. If the case of the wireless issues, you'd better hope they show up before 90 days. I was not so lucky, so Microsoft will not replace mine under warranty. Instead you're directed to a statement that they 'acknowledge' the issues but actual support ends there and they tell you too bad, buy another.I'm a responsible adult. I take care of my possessions, and don't drop or throw my controllers. I should not have to buy an extended warranty on a $180 peripheral to ensure I get my money's worth. A peripheral with known issues like this should be taken off the market and the issues fixed rather than continue to be sold. Mine lasted 4 months before the bluetooth problems started and its almost unusable without being connected now. Don't get duped, avoid it unless you like to gamble.

Since then, in my spare time I will go back to playing video games for a little while to take my mind off of things.  In recent years I have tried several controllers that I can use via Bluetooth or cable.  I have used a wireless controller for years, but this Elite Series 2... is just incredible.  The design and grip and feel of the controller is very nearly perfect.  I have never used a better controller, for anything.  The buttons on the back are an amazing idea and although I have yet to implement them into my gameplay, I will be doing so very soon.  The controller comes with a great charging case, and many replaceable parts.  The hair trigger adjustment on the back of the controller was a game changer for me, I love having the ability to adjust it when I need to.  I highly recommend this controller to any gamer that appreciates a well made controller.

  Honestly so disappointed with this $180 controller. The last one had its issues, and I assumed Microsoft would pay attention when crafting this one, but I was wrong. I understand many people here have had no issues; I wanted to be one of them. Just felt I needed to add my misfortune for others to see.The Issues After <20 Hours:1. The B button majorly sticks - Used this button a lot playing Rocket League - If button is pressed directly down, it sticks a bit, and if pushed on an angle, it will stick until pushed down at the opposite angle. Definitely the biggest issue.2.  The A button registers MOST presses, but for $180, it should register all presses. If the button is pressed too lightly, or again, at an angle, the button push will not be registered by the controller.3.  The left thumb stick is already beginning to drift. At any given time, the thumb stick may decide to stick in a certain position, causing constant input. If one is playing a game that has sensitive deadzones, it is extremely noticeable.Things I Like:1.  The paddles on the back have been redesigned, and they are MUCH better than before. They have a better feeling when pressed, and they also fit my larger hands in a more ergonomic way.2.  Much better feel in the grips than the first iteration.3.  The three settings of hair trigger are very well implemented.4.  As before, the controller has a solid, weighted feel. It is very satisfying to hold.This controller would be my favorite controller of all time, if not for the defects. One star is justified as the $180 controller showed defects after under twenty hours of game play. Buy one at your own risk; you may get lucky as others have

  Yeah, it's comfortable, and the interchangeable sticks/D-pads are nice. I love the paddles too, BUT THE CONTROLLER HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS. Just three months of light use (maybe 8 hours per week) and the controller is malfunctioning on a somewhat regular basis.  Roughly every other day I use this thing I find myself trying to wrangle the controls, until I decide to stop playing out of frustration. Every one of the joysticks, paddles, and buttons, stick (not physically on the controller, but but a small motion to the left with my joystick sends the avatar spinning in circles) or go dead for several minutes. It's unpredictable and EXTREMELY annoying. My last cheapa$$ controller developed stick drift after about 8 months, which sucked, but it's better than this. I'd rather buy a cheap one every year or so than invest in this garbage. Two stars only because it worked great and felt great for the first couple months. I'm basically out $180, so pissed.

    My new go-to Controller
  
",5.0,Chris Lee Mullins,"Reviewed in the United States January 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  This will be a quick review.I've logged over 1,000 hours on the original Elite 1 without any issues. Getting the Elite 2 seemed like a no-brainer. After about 20 hours playing Dishonored 2, Destiny 2 and Borderlands 3 on the Elite 2, I think I've found my new go-to Xbox controller. From a gaming perspective, with some minor complaint, this controller is nearly perfect.I do have three minor complaints.1) Microsoft includes only one tall thumbstick on the Elite 2. The original Elite 1 included two, albeit not as tall. I much prefer taller thumbsticks as I find it easier for precision aiming. What's worse, the neither the original nor third party thumbsticks from the Elite 1 fit on the Elite 2. A silly decision, as there's nothing about the design of the tension modifier on the Elite 2 that would mandate such a change. We all know why they pull that nonsense.2) The second minor issue is the decision to give the Home button zero travel distance. I've got several Xboxes, a multitude of controllers (all three of my kids each have their own customized controller) and the new ""clickiness"" of the Home button on the Elite 2 throws me for a loop every time I use it.3) I'm not onboard with the decision to internalize the battery. I already have a solution for charging my controllers. Now I need to find space in my already-cramped entertainment center to accommodate one more or starting charging the Elite 2 on the kitchen counter space reserved for tablet and phone charging.Overall, I'm exceedingly happy with the Elite 2, especially the adjustable thumbstick tension and the inclusion of the taller thumbstick. It's not perfect **for me** for the reasons listed above, but its still an improvement over the Elite 1.

  I pre-ordered and received this controller back in November of 2019. I got it plugged it in, updated it from my console, and absolutely love it! I play competitively so I used it pretty frequently. I kept it clean and don't bang it around or mash buttons, so recently I noticed an issue with my right trigger feeling, ""sticky"" or tough to press down.. which was immediately noticeable, I figured it might have been because I got something stuck in it, but after thorough inspection and sitting there just pressing it, it seems it's a manufacturing issue, which is extremely disappointing; now currently a week after first noticing the issue, the (hair trigger) option doesn't register and the ""stickyness"" of the trigger is worse. I did a quick Google search and looked at recent reviews and noticed a lot of similar issues with sticky buttons.. I'm hoping to contact Microsoft/Amazon and see if I can get this replaced, because I'd hate to have to rebuy another expensive controller; for an almost $200 controller.. I didn't expect an issue like this, even so soon, especially since I take such good care of my electronics. I hope this issue gets resolved with later models. (Edit: apparently you don't get the warranty if you purchase it off here; at least that's what they told me. I bought a second one and had the same issues as the last.. broke the thing into tiny little pieces and threw it in the trash along with the other one. A sole waste of money, and a scam from Microsoft. I'm truly disappointed)

I have a warranty and I’m waiting for it to return to try it again and maybe someone else gets better luck but be aware, if you’re willing to spend $220-$250 on a controller, get the warranty. These controllers are known to get drift stick and don’t be like me and think you won’t get it bc I got it the 3rd week of having it brand new.

    So much better than the standard XBox Controller!
  
",4.0,Brent,"Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2021","









  
  
    
  Same shape and buttons as the standard XBox One controller, but:* Feels 3x heavier  I like it. Others do not.* Sticks have replaceable rubberized knobs with more or less friction  The most-sticky one felt best, but the one with the least friction is what I settled on for general comfort.* 4 paddles  These are extra inputs that may be attached underneath which can be mapped to any other button, as well as some additional functions of the platform, such as ""Take Screenshot"" or ""Record what just happened"".  One of the paddles can optionally work as a Shift key to change the behavior of any other button on the controller (not just the other 3 paddles).  One use of the paddles could be to move forward, while another could move backward. This saves the thumbs!Cons:(1) The problem with mapping paddles to LS is that they glitch and intermittently stop, then start again. You could be dead in that half a second delay.  This could be because of the way they are not solidly connected. Instead, the paddles insert into the bottom and attach magnetically. I've even had one fall out in-between games and only noticed at during the next game when I went to use it and ... nothing was there!  I am tempted to find a way to solder them in place to see if that's the reason for the glitch.(2) There are not enough functions for the paddles to map to. You cannot Sprint, for example, since I didn't find a way to map a paddle to LS-forward + LS-press.(3) There are not enough buttons!  This controller is expensive. I would expect a few additional levers and buttons to be able to map to special functions, which could be left unmapped for those who don't want or need them.

    My opinion Microsoft doesn't care about you or quality on this controller
  
",1.0,Geoffrey Layton,"Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2021","









  
  
    
  We all want to love this controller. Unfortunately all of the quality is on the outside and even that is an illusion.Inside you have extremely cheap thumb-stick modules.... so cheap in-fact that Microsoft had a class action lawsuit. I have a post lawsuit controller that microsoft appears to have replaced that module with an equally terrible one.Microsoft support for issues on a 200 controller are laughable. At this price point microsoft should allow advanced replacements. (They dont according to their customer care). So your stuck shipping it back in your own box and waiting weeks for your replacement.I called microsoft asked for an advanced replacement was told they had submitted it for two weeks before finding out it wasn't and its not even a possibility. Microsoft lied to me. Then refuses to make anything right and asked me to ship it in standard and wait weeks.This is my second controller. My first had the same issues as everyone else.Dont buy this controller. Buy a high quality third partyBased on the quality of parts inside these controllers id guess Microsofts bill of materials gives them substantial markup on these controllers.Microsoft is literally tone deaf to its target audience. Gamers dont want to wait weeks for their controllers.In contrast if apple phone breaks apple has a new one to me in a day.Microsoft lied to me and their turn around times are poor.I want to love this controller. But microsoft only cares about profit. They dont care about quality. This controller is designed to appear to be high quality its internal parts are garbage

    Best Xbox Remote Ever
  
",5.0,Joseph Knoernschild,"Reviewed in the United States January 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  I preordered this, after having a scuff for the last 2 years. I received it on 11/1/19. It took me about two weeks to get used to it compared to the scuff as the paddles where in different locations. I love it and would take it over a scuff any day of the week! I have had no issues with it disconnecting, like the scuff did. I love the ability to program the remote in the software on xbox and have 3-4 profiles. I also like that you can program any of the buttons or sticks to the paddles; a limitation on the scuff. The battery life is also incredible. I get well over 20 hours of gaming on a charge; my guess is that I am getting about 40 hours or more as I have charged it twice since getting it. I think the scuff has better grips but I have gotten used to the elites grips. I have noticed that most of the time I have to turn it on twice as the first time it flashes for a second and shuts off. I also can't change the brightness of the center logo button but it is dim so I am ok with that. The warranty is now 1 year instead of 90 days so that is also great. The controller feels solid and of high quality; I am very pleased. I would highly recommend this controller and would get it instead of a scuff as I was quite disappointed with my scuff and had to send it to scuff for repair 2-3 times which was a lot for occasional use.

  After about one year, my controllers left bumper is non-functional. After contacting Microsoft, they offered no repair service and recommended a replacement. Ugg. I was fed up. There is no way I’m spending another $180 replacing a controller that fails in one year. It’s simply too expensive and not worth it. I did open it up in the hope that It was repairable by simply inserting a piece of plastic between the plunger and actuator. Unfortunately I found at the actuator (i.e. the button) was the problem and there’s no practical way to replace it. So that’s $180 down the toilet. The controller played great for about a year but that’s simply too much money to spend especially when the $60 controller controller Seems to last much longer! It just doesn’t make any sense. Why is the elite series controller so prone to reliability and longevity problems. Microsoft must do better than this.

  I've gotten four of these controllers from Walmart and returned them all, and plan on returning this one from Amazon as well, because all of the A buttons are unresponsive if pressed at random angles, angles that you press during game play. This is incredibly annoying as a Rocket League player who has their boost bound to A, you jump to go for the ball, your boost doesn't work, you lose the game, simple as that.Microsoft obviously does not test these controllers, 5 different controllers, all with the same problem. They have no support page for their controllers on their support page (that I've found) and many more people have this issue, they've known about the issue since November but it hasn't been fixed, they either don't care or don't know how to fix the issue.If you're not constantly pressing your A button the controller is perfect, the weight makes you confident with it's build, it's black and dark gray across the entire controller which looks VERY nice, the sticks feel too stiff but grant surprisingly  good accuracy, the profiles are great for different types of games, the grips feel amazing as they go around both sides and not just the bottom, the paddles are the best on the market in terms of positioning, and the ""wireless"" charger in the case gives you a sense of technological advancement. The controller is superb in every way and is superior to Microsoft's other controllers, but I cannot get past the unresponsive A button which is much more persistent than I would've thought.

  I bought this back in February.  When I first bought it, the A button was unresponsive and I sent it back to get a replacement. The replacement I recieved also has a slightly unresponsive A button, but it wasn't bad enough to return. Today, July 6th (only 5 months after purchasing) one of the trigger stop switches just broke off. We don't use that feature that often, so there shouldn't be much wear. I expected much better from an ""elite"" controller. We originally bought the first series as well, and a plastic internal component of the right trigger broke within a year (which after researching seems to be a common problem). The controller functionally has been great, its comfortable to use, and definitely enhances the player's experience, but it doesn't hold up over time which is unfortunate. I wouldn't recommend buying for the full price with how quickly these controllers tend to break.

  I love this controller. Feels amazing, extremely comfortable, the configuration and shift key concept opens up so many options, tensioners very useful.  That said , honestly I dont know what madness is driving me to give it a five star though. I guess I really wanted to like it ! The one I got shipped from amazon was defective like may of the 1 star reviews here (unresponsive A button and right stick click). Instead of returning I took to microsoft store and they swapped it out without much hassle( and didnt take much convincing to buy the 20 dollar 3 year extended warranty). Thr SECOND controller had no right stick issue but did have am unresponsive a button again(better than first but not perfect-so not acceptable). Then just exchanged a 3rd time. Now no defective buttons and I can enjoy the games... so far I love it no questions asked.  I sincerely hope Microsoft resolve whatever QA systemic nightmare lead to launching 180 dollar contoller that are literally supposed to be able to register a total of 6 buttons, 2 triggers, and 2 sticks... with defective buttons...(Does that read like a 1 star review to anyone)If the contoller wasnt so.. amazing ... I would've given up and 1 started it a long time ago. Hoping 3rd 1 sticks.

    Still can't manually reassign the extra triggers to keys. Everything else - excellent.
  
",5.0,Joseph,"Reviewed in the United States December 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  I owned the Xbox One Elite's first generation (despite never owning an Xbox One) and used it as my primary controller for everything. I fell in love with the weight, grips, and beveled D-pad. Unfortunately, these have a routine and excessively common issue, and the shoulder bumpers broke about a week after it was out of warranty. This appears to happen to basically everybody eventually. I bought extremely inexpensive aftermarket bumpers, replaced them, and never had another problem with the thing despite near daily use for 4 years.Unfortunately, a couple months ago, it developed a dead zone in the stick. This is completely, absolutely reasonable with that amount of use over such a long time, so I looked into replacing it and found out about the Series 2. After getting one, I have no complaints whatsoever. The shoulder buttons are holding up for now (though a professional disassembly and review said they probably have the same problems as the last one) and everything else is either exactly the same or notably improved. The 3 stage triggers are particularly nice, the middle stage is just right for me, and wasn't an option on the old one.It's a bit heavy, but the inbuilt battery lasts far far longer than I would expect, and the charger is amazing. It's magnetic in a way that makes making sure it's set on the charger and connected brainless and super easy. I was hesitant about the switch from the old AAs (I used rechargeable) to the inbuilt battery but in the end, it's a major winner. Very happy.The only issue I would warn potential buyers about (besides the shoulder buttons, who knows if that problem continues in this one) is that you cannot remap the extra 4 triggers you can add to basic keys. If you google around you'll see a bunch of stuff saying you can remap it with some first party Xbox app for the computer, and that's true-ISH - you can remap it to other CONTROLLER BUTTONS. But you can't just map it to keys, it just doesn't support it at all. In the end, the solution for this one is the same as the last one, just by a ReWASD license. I typically hate licensed software and tried all of the open source alternatives but none of them really compare. Save yourself the hassle, spend the $6, and buy ReWASD if you need to remap those extra triggers. It's $6 on a $200 controller, anyway.

  This controller is absolute garbage in one aspect: it’s not wireless. This is the whole entire point of spending $200.00 on a ‘state of the art’ gaming peripheral. Literally everything else is great- except that it doesn’t work, which means that the entire thing is as utterly useless as a fancy paperweight. I have used it on my $3000.00 Alienware and additionally have a $150.00 wireless mouse (ROG SPATHA) which has absolutely no issues playing games such as Dark Souls III and Code Vein. Meanwhile, even with the proper controller driver installed and the newest Windows OS active, I find the controller FREQUENTLY disconnecting from my computer. Sometimes it reconnects after actual minutes, other times I have restart the controller or re-introduce it to my computer by erasing it first. This is unacceptable and I will be returning it and purchasing something from a more reliable brand such as Logitech, Razer, or Corsair. Overall, if you like the look of the controller and fancy magnetic analog sticks, please buy it. But if you want a functional device which actually does what it’s fundamentally designed to do, buy anything else.

",3.0,enero30,"Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had to exchange the first one I got because the BT was a disaster! The 2nd one connects ok. But not smoothly. BUT even though it connects, the latency is garbage. Definitely not useable for shooters. I ended up having to buy a separate wireless adapter to get this controller to work properly (Wirelessly). Having to buy this adapter is a spit in the face from MS. Considering how much this controller cost, they should have at least included one if not 10! I also should add that all the regular Xbox controllers that I've used in the last 5 years that have built-in Bluetooth have all be great, never had any issues connecting, with very low latency compared to this one. Very useable for shooters. If you don't NEED this controller and want to use BT, DON'T get this one.I got this controller because I seem to be heavy-handed (or rather, heavy-thumbed) with my controllers and pretty much have to buy one every 12 months or so. I'm hoping this one will last a little longer than the regular controllers. The control sticks on the underside are a bit too close together for me, and I had to remove the bigger set because I constantly hit the wrong stick. I'm also getting used to using them and often forget that they're there. Hopefully, I will get used to having them, they definitely are handy to have.

    Faulty hardware, sticky buttons, stick drift - eventual degradation of quality/condition over time
  
",1.0,Ronald Thompson,"Reviewed in the United States August 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  As stated, the buttons and such on the controller are sticky and often do not work unless you mash a bit to get them to fire - which is a bunch of crap for a “premium” controller. This is a bit hit or miss depending on the batch you get, and whether you get lucky so in terms of button quality - your experiences may vary with the controller out of the box. The only good news here from my experiences is the buttons do not get any worse.What does not vary, and what is completely unacceptable though - is the eventual and inevitable stick drift. This will get you, it’s only a matter of “when”. Stick drift on these controllers, is the continued registration of a tilt of the thumb sticks despite the user not (or no longer) applying any input to the stick. Very similar to the debacle of the Nintendo JoyCons (minus the free repairs Nintendo provided). This is most prominent in games with sensitive detection of movement, where your inputs will start to extend long after you release the stick. Sad news here is if you do not have stick drift, or it’s not so bad at first - it will be.My thumb sticks deteriorated over time, eventually beginning to drift so bad that tapping up would get stuck in the menus of the console’s home screen - a mere 6 months after purchase, meaning it’s drifting a LOT. This was not always the case and no significant event occurred that would have caused this to happen, besides the possible wear and tear from regular use. I am a disabled gamer, with frail hands and whom does not play a whole lot - so I do not provide a lot of persistent nor heavy pressure to buttons or sticks, so take this as a warning - this product, under even the weakest duress - will give out on you. You just wait - It’s well documented and trending in reviews. It’s a real problem.Spare yourself and do not buy these controllers until the Xbox team and hardware engineers put some pride and care into their products again. The first Elite Series controller was a keeper which I’ve since returned to, but the Series 2 is a lazy and reckless re-envisioning, that despite the big positives and upgrades to the original - is a complete disappointment and a overall faulty piece of tech with flaws and defects that no consumer should have to accept at this price point.

  Overall:  Great New Gen Controller!  Ignore the ignorant charging cradle, and enjoy the new feel and response!WARNING: For some bizarre reason, Amazon sticks a REFURB in your Basket!!!  HIGHLY advise to choose a NEW controller directly from MS!SHOCKINGLY GREAT!  Was really pleased with the solid feel, spring in the buttons, triple level settings for the triggers, better tab trigger placement, slightly smaller/better handing form factor, AND the new covering is Way better!  The new covering feels plush, but not slippery, and doesn't heat up.  I was expecting ""just another elite controller"", but this is truly an upgrade!  Better Shoulder attachments, which has historically been a weak point, so this one feels like it will last longer, finally fixed!Downside: battery is enclosed (but they did make it rechargeable!  Note: you need to charge before first use.), and the recharging cradle is awkward at best.  However, you can just plug a USB-C right into the back of the controller, and skip the lame cradle, or in-case charging (which should never be done anyway - never charge a battery inside a closed case due to heat).Note: I'll Update if things change.Note 2: Insure it if you can!UPDATE: the Stereo jack doesn't seem to work with my Mic!  Could be a config issue - using full headset for now... Will post an update.

  1st one didn't last 30 days so I luckily got in on the return window.  Amazon didn't like it and sent an email saying so.  I hope the replacement holds up better.

The built in battery is annoying to me as I have my own drop in rechargeable, but if you don't its there already.  You have to use the built in charger though and it's in the case.  That's how I kept mine anyway, so no big deal, but it could be depending on your storage setup.  More software adjustments and settings but none I use.  One extra trigger length setting too.  Handy but not enough of a change to matter.  The extra rubber grip is nice and the paddle layout change is good too.  Although I didn't have an issue with the series 1 paddles.Overall a good upgrade if it holds up.  If not, 1 star all the way!  How can you pay almost $200 for a controller that doesn't last with adult low use and high quality care.  Stick drift has been reported by several reviewers and showed up quickly on my 1st one.  Light, but when you released the stick you would start to move or spin in game without touching the remote.  Even minor this is an annoyance and enough to request a replacement even if Amazon doesn't like it.

  I have two standard Xbox Elite controllers, one is very old and it still worked but was showing its age with mushy buttons, a little drift, rubber grip separated and of course bumpers that broke (I replaced them). But the controller performed well most of the time and I really liked the extra features (paddles and trigger adjustments). So I bought a second Elite once the first one got to loose. The second one also performed well and after 3 years is still working (again suffering a broken bumper). I replaced the bumper but it didn't work properly (had to push harder than the other bumper) so I purchased the newer Elite 2 controller. It is very similar to the original and I like it a lot. it has different grips that wrap around more (and so far have not separated) but they are slicker than the older version and can get slippery if your hands get sweaty. The paddles are again a great feature as is the trigger adjustments. The stick tension adjustment is a nice addition. The included battery charging puck is nice and heavy for stability and magnetic so it sticks to the controller when charging. Battery life is good and so far the buttons/paddles are working perfectly and still nice and tight.

  Over rated, equally over priced. It feels great, looks great, plays great, but not compared to the cost. It is not worth the price. Besides that, the ""metal"" parts seem to rub off onto ones fingers, and the rubberized grips make ones hands overly sweaty. I do not normally have sweaty hands. Very noticeable after only a few minutes of game play after the first use. It's heavier than other controllers, actually giving it a nice feel, the triggers are very soft when pulling them all the way. Unless you have the hair trigger on, then they are very ""clacky"", for lack of a better word. (It's beyond me why they did not make the hair trigger settings as soft as the regular setting). After some serious gaming, I am noticing the thumb sticks, even at their highest tension, feel as though they are becoming very loose. If the price was more reasonable, I would suggest it for its Pros. Considering the Cons, it's not worth the price.

Will return and buy something else.Some quick comparisons to the original Elite Series 1 Controller:1)Compared to the original Elite controller the grip on the series 2 is not as grippy.2) The weight distribution on the Series 2 controller feels more evenly distributed and therefore does not feel as heavy and clunky as the Series 13)The tension adjustments on the Series 2 takes a little to get used to.  But once you do, it's great for precision.4) The triggers on the series 2 just feel better and more responsive.5) Battery life on the series 2 is amazing.All in all the Series 2 is a great upgrade to the Series 1 except for the grip..  However, I can't seem to get a controller without button issues or stick drift. Microsoft needs to tighten up their quality control and figure out what is going on with all these faulty controllers. Because I have no idea how they let this many faulty controllers out into the wild.  Also please Microsoft extend the warranty for at least 6-12 months.90 days of warranty for an expensive piece of equipment does not show much faith in your product.8/11/20I am on my 3rd Xbox Elite series 2 controller with different Lot Numbers.  The first lot number I received was 2020 which had the infamous unresponsive A & Y buttons at times.  Then after that I received Lot number 2021 controller which had stick drift issues on the right stick.Now the 3rd controller that I have received is Lot number 2025 and I don't seem to have any issues at the moment(fingers crossed).  I will continue to update this review as time goes by and if any issues crop up.  I think I will have to move on to a different controller company if this controller has any issues.If you play Warzone please go into the setting and adjust your deadzone for the controller to around .06-.07 depending on your controllers deadzone.  For some reason Warzone seems to be super sensitive and needs the deadzone to be adjusted.

  I bought this straight from Microsoft despite all the terrible reviews of sticking buttons and drifting sticks. I figured it's been out for a while so the bugs should be fixed by now... HA! was I wrong! Straight out of the box the left joy stick drifted so bad I couldn't even select anything in the settings menu. This would be unacceptable for a normal budget controller but for a top of the line $200 controller it is heartbreaking and insulting. I should've listened to all the warnings in the reviews.

  So i do give Amazon 4 stars but to Microsoft 1 star, because the is a 180$ controller that should be near perfect, although it might just be my bad luck it shouldn’t happen to everyone, i am now receiving my third replacement for this controller because the first two were defective, same issue for both, on one the A button was not registering and would frequently stick, the second was the B button same issue, so hopefully third times the charm, if you order this elite series 2 controller just hope its perfect right out the box, Amazon took care of me and sent me replacements after talking to customer service.

  I just received this controller yesterday, 9/19/2020. The upper right paddle doesn't work right and the sticks drift. Just unbelievable! It's just like the poor quality of the Elite Series 1!The upper right paddle doesn't work right. I have to press the paddle in very hard to get it to register. If I swap the lower paddle for the top paddle, it works perfectly. It appears that the nub on the paddle just isn't long enough to press in the little button on the back. I'm sure if I was sent new paddles, that issue would be resolved.The sticks already drift.... Just like the old controller. I can't believe it, for a $180 controller, this shouldn't happen at all. Where is the quality control? I mean, I don't know how much drift I should live with? I don't think I should have to live with any stick drift at all especially for a $180 controller! I am sending this controller back and will keep doing this until I get a properly working controller. I will continue to update this review as time goes on.*edit October 8 2020*Replacement sticks drift too. It's not as bad as the first controller sent though, I guess I can live with it, but I'm tired of living with junk! Not sure what to do...

    4 month warranty? They know this thing breaks.
  
",1.0,Mieu,"Reviewed in the United States August 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  Microsoft's warranty given with this controller is only 4 months. They do not offer you an additional warranty to purchase when you buy this. They KNOW when this will break down and support actually has the nerve to suggest ""you're free to purchase a new one!"" How helpful. I bought this in December 2019 as a much anticipated gift. It hasn't even been one year. It's cared for like a beloved grandmother by its owner. Now the right bumper is failing - half the presses don't register. We tried everything in the configuration menu to reset it, nothing. The button isn't easily removed or replaced, and its owner doesn't want to risk a DIY repair at home so we contacted support. Microsoft support literally told me they won't and can't help, that they aren't able to repair this controller when a button breaks, that warranty replacement was our only option and we were out of warranty. Then shuttled us off the phone and out of chat.This kind of product should be warrantied for a year; at this price point, I should AT LEAST have been offered a secondary warranty to purchase. I'm extremely disappointed with Microsoft; their hardware, their repair capabilities, and their customer service.This is why people buy Apple - at least they'll allow me to pay them to repair the darn thing if it breaks.

",2.0,Kujo,"Reviewed in the United States October 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  Let me count the ways Microsoft screwed this one up.-Abysmal quality control.--I've gone through 6 of these controllers and EVERY SINGLE ONE has had the same problems. Sticky face buttons, sticky triggers, and unresponsive A button.-Garbage warranty--Microsoft only offers a 90 day warranty... on a nearly $200 product. If you want the extended two year warranty, you need to PURCHASE IT FOR $20 from the Microsoft store.-Random disconnects--The controller has bluetooth! Hooray! Only problem is that it randomly disconnects mid boss fight and the only way to reconnect it is to hold down the power button for 10 seconds to hard shutoff, remove it from the paired devices list in your computer, then RE-PAIR IT with the computer. Rinse and repeat every 45 minutes to an hour of gameplay. OR buy their stupid adapter that you're not supposed to need. My $45 8bitdo controller has never had a single connection issue over BT, I can't imagine why this ""Elite"" controller can't get it right.Honestly, for $180+, this controller is a flaming garbage fire. It's so close to being good, but it's kneecapped by it's incredible failures at basic functionality that it makes it a non-starter. I'm blown away by this thing somehow having 4.5 stars in Amazon. This controller is the basis for an ongoing CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT over stick drift and quality issues.This controller is so notoriously bad that there's one of the largest reddit threads of all time (in r/xboxone) made up of fans who just wanted to get a working elite controller, most of which have bought and RMA'ed multiple (some, up to 12 units) elite controllers over the period of several months to years. I finally gave up after receiving my 6th one and realizing that they must all be defective, since every single unit I've received has the exact same core problem (the A button), with a surprise grab bag of other problems (sticky buttons, stick drift, leaking adhesive on the thumbsticks, etc).So, TL:DR-Don't waste the next 3 months of your life warranty swapping this melted turd over and over again hoping for a golden onion. It's not gonna happen.And don't trust these 5 star reviews.If you do decide you like pain, go ahead and drop your $200 and roll the dice, but the first thing you should do is plug it in to your PC, open the Xbox controller app software, and check each and every button many times. I guarantee you that A button has problems registering on light presses and on any angle other than directly on.

  On the surface, the Elite Series 2 looks like a true enthusiast's controller. It has a very nice weight to it, the radial d-pad is great, the extra analog stick options are neat, and the paddles on the back promise a unique utility you've probably never used before. However, the cracks in this controller start to show almost immediately after seriously using it for the first time. Within 10 minutes of using my first and second controllers, I noticed the following problems:- Unresponsive face buttons. Just because you press a button far enough for the ""bump"" or ""dip"" to happen, the input may still not be read. For example, if I flick my thumb across a face button, like I want to input a short-hop jump in a platformer, there's a good chance I won't jump at all. For the A-button, I can replicate this almost every time if I try.- Aggressive snap-back on analog sticks. These sticks are heavy but they glide very smoothly. I really like the feel of them. But either they're too heavy or the spring in them is too strong, because if I flick my left stick all the way up and release, there's a >50% chance that it will snap back so quickly that it will pass through the neutral position and input down for a frame. This makes the analog sticks basically worthless for quick, aggressive movements, which can occur in almost any game.- Loose-feeling paddles. I feel like I can move the paddles in the back too easily. The magnet fixings for the paddles make it easy to remove and replace the paddles at your leisure, but this convenience comes at the cost of stability.I want to love and use this controller so much. I mean, I spent a bunch of money on it, surely I deserve to have a controller with reliable buttons and control sticks, at least, right? These issues shouldn't show up in any controller over $30, let alone over $100. These issues are widespread, too. Searching ""Elite series 2 stick drift/unresponsive buttons"" will show dozens of forum posts from users experiencing these problems. I often think one star is too strong a negative rating for most things, but these problems are supposed to be the first things to avoid when designing a controller. That these problems also showed up on two of my controllers in a row just shows the lack of quality assurance coming from Microsoft with these controllers, which just baffles me. Don't spend your money on this, you'll get a better experience out of an old Xbox 360 or PS4/5 controller.

  The Buttons feel amazing on this controller, but after some hardcore use (hours and hours of smashing buttons like an elite pro gamer) the same buttons have broken again. The RB button is built with cheap plastic that cannot withstand daily use apparently. It broke on my first controller after a year of use, and luckily i got a new replacement controller of the same for no  price at all. BUt this second controller only lasted a few months before the same button broke. will not be buying again.

  I wanted to like this controller but there is clearly a manufacturing problem with the face buttons. The first one I got, The (A) button did not register being pressed. I ordered a replacement. The replacement kept getting delayed so I canceled that and just placed a new order entirely. The new order got here today and the (X) button keeps sticking in the downward position. That being said this one may have been on amazon because the box was partially open upon arrival so I'm not sure how much it was tossed around. Anyhow, I am returning this and would recommend people steer clear until the face button problem can be addressed.

  I had the original elite controller and it's been great for a bunch of years now. A few weeks ago, the left hand rubber grip started separating from the the controller like so many others have complained about. There wasn't anything else wrong with it- rechargeable battery was good for 15 hours or so, which is about a week for me, buttons and triggers worked great, no issues with the thumbsticks or accessories, but the grip was annoying. I heard this thing was coming out and tried to play with one at my local MS store. They were sold out and told me it would be two to three weeks before I could even put one in my hands. I saw that Amazon had them in stock and ready for one day shipping, so I just went ahead and did it.I was glad I did! The size and shape are nearly identical, but I really liked the new three-stage trigger stops and the adjustable tension thumbsticks. I also liked that instead of two profiles on a hard switch, I can now have four profiles (including the blank ""default"") to switch through. It's been more useful than I thought having those. Instead of just ""shooter"" and ""racing"" modes, I now have different setups for the type of shooter- 1st person needs faster throws than 3rd person, and I don't have to go into the app between games to reload saved profiles. It's great.I also really like the new charging stand. I don't like that I can't swap battery packs on the fly, but the 40 hour battery life makes it kind of a moot point. It's compact and slick and I like the magnets. It doesn't interfere with the turtle beach headphone adapter, which swapped directly over with no weird gaps or fit issues (another plus).What's less great is that the buttons still don't have a snappy, positive feel to them. They're just like the old ones, which are on the mushy side.Overall, I don't think it's worth it to get the series 2 if your original elite controller is in good condition. I know I wouldn't have done it had the grip not come off. It's not enough of an upgrade otherwise. It's still getting five stars because on its own, it's fantastic, just like what it's replacing. You can't go wrong.

  Mine came with horrible srick drift. Some articles mentioned the early batches had quality control issues.Stick drift aside, there were issues that made it uncomfortable. The controller is much heavier than the standard. Most likely due to the massive built in battery and heavier parts. But that means more hand fatigue.There's also the metal sticks. While the adjustable tension is great, the sticks will eat through the rubber shell.The built in battery is back dual edge sword. It's lithium based, so it can maintain a good charge. But it also means you can't swap out the batteries. So you gotta wait for it to recharge. Factor in the lack of replacement battery packs. So you're junking a $160 controller when it dies.Overall it's the most premium controller I've held. Beats the Astro, Scuf, Razer, and Hori in that department. But it has the same flaw as those other premium controllers.When it eventually breaks, it's game over. A kid that plays daily will wear it out. Either the stick sensors, grips, battery, USB plug, or buttons will go.

    BEWARE: STRICT 3 MONTH REPAIR WARRANTY NOW - Microsoft charges $100 to mail it in if anything breaks
  
",1.0,Not Elvis,"Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I loved the controller until the left bumper button stopped working. I spoke with a Microsoft representative to get it repaired well within the first year of owning it. They were less than helpful and spoke in broken English. What was made clear by the rep is that more than three months of use is a lot of wear and tear for an elite 2 controller. He indicated that my controller was very old according to Microsoft.I don't consider several months of use to be a viable lifespan for en Elite controller. I don't mind being told no per say, but I don't like it when Microsoft acts like I am ridiculous for even calling them about a controller warranty that is more than three months old. I also find their option of $100 up-front payment and mail in for repair or refurb to be less than fair when their product fails within the first few months, well within the first year of the products life.In short, if Microsoft doesn't stand behind the product for more than 90 days and if Microsoft considers their flagship controller to be a 90 day lifespan, then I won't vouch for it either. I am an adult, who plays easy and doesn't abuse electronics....and mine broke. Buy at your own risk.

  This is a real treat. Originally, I felt these controllers were a fad ginned up to hype over price ""gamer as a life style"" gadgets, or whatever the marketing trash people were soaking up. So, of course, I forgot about it.I started to come around when I got back into COD and I noticed people panic hopping and still able to scratch out kills. At first I thought it was ""bumper jumper"" or the claw grip, unsure, I sent one of them a message and they confirmed it was the Elite controller.Admittedly, I'm a bit set in my ways, I'm done with memorizing a new control scheme for every game with few exceptions, and I refuse to change my grip. But paddles would make certain tasks much easier or more doable.Little did I know at the time the Elite makes old games with weird or outdated button layouts great again! I fired up the original Saint's Row on Xbox and  immediately changed both the driving and the on foot controls. Now, with the push of a button, I can enjoy this classic, arguably the best in the franchise, with the functionality of the newer games control layout. I still have to switch button profiles between driving or on foot, but it's better than relearning bad and out dated controls just for a nostalgia trip.This control is totally worth the premium price tag. It fully works with all xbox accessories. The built-in battery lasts forever. The customization app is easy to use. The circle d-pad is the best in the industry. This controller is so good I wish devs would add extra paddle functionality options into their games. One recommendation, not sure if this is already a thing, would be to allow the alt button to be toggled instead of just held.

  Let me start off by saying this a great controller, the battery life blows any rechargeable controller out of the water, its ergonomics are second to none. However, that’s all to be expected since you’re paying a VERY premium price for this controller. My issue I’ve had with this controller all seem to be mechanical, firstly both by the X and B button seem to get randomly “sticky” to where when you press them they don’t fully retract back into possession or do so in a slow manner. I don’t eat when I play and don’t know what caused this. Secondly, the LB bumper only works when its being pressed a certain way and even then sometimes it’ll stop working randomly when I’m holding it. (Heart beat sensor in warzone)The actual ergonomics of the controller is great and when everything does work as intended this is without a doubt the best Xbox controller on the market. The the hair trigger and paddles make for such a different playing experience and it takes getting used to but once I did I‘ll never go back to a regular stock controller. It’s just a shame a controller at this price point has these issues.

  Disconnects frequently and repeatedly and takes your game with it to the grave: Games stutter massively and hitch/hang until this thing reconnects (if it does just that) several seconds later. Unplayable, even with the keyboard as I scramble to save my character yet again. Sometimes it requires powering off and back on to reconnect. And if you sit there like an idiot waiting for it to reconnect, you must now remove it from Bluetooth and reconfigure before you can play again. Good one, Microsoft.Inputs occasionally register twice instantly, most noticeable in menus. Y sometimes fails and, if it doesn't, somehow triggers X instead (??) rarely. RB is 2.5 times louder than LB (3x if pressed from the edge) and squeaks. Sounds cheap. It's also beginning to fail now, just after LT a few weeks ago (no longer works when trigger slider is maxed). The rubber cap for RT's trigger slider fell out long ago due to no adhesion and was finally lost. Did my best to hold it in each session, but I finally snapped due to 6 months of pent-up rage.This controller kills me the most and makes my cheap, bone-stock XB1 controller quiet and reliable in comparison.Seemingly designed to fail after your laughable 90-day warranty so you're forced to buy it again... Ah, if you're still not guillotined, Microsoft wants you to pay $10 for 1–2 week shipping. Nah, man, they're gonna have to pay for it, but now I'm in limbo for a month, for better or worse.Don't be like me and think you'll get lucky. Listen to others' voices and ask if this experience is worth so much of your precious time.Man, did MS show me and spit on afterward. Damn, I need a shower after this one. Easily my worst buy.

  I really wanted to love this controller. It feels very high quality, and it's the only controller I've found that has 4 ""paddles"" that let your ring finger and pinky be useful while gaming. Part of the body appears to be made of metal. The D-Pad and joysticks are even made of metal that magnetically pop into their slots. And being able to change the resistance of the joysticks is really nice.But the software is what ruined it. For one, you can only remap the paddles to existing buttons. Even on PC, steam won't recognize those as their own buttons. I had to buy a 3rd part program for them to be actually useful.The connectivity issues were what really killed it! The joysticks frequently ""stick"" in the sense that the computer will think you kept the joystick in a certain direction after you moved it (sometimes for upwards of 5 seconds). It did this on both computers I tested. I even reinstalled windows on one of them, and it did it after that. So it must be hardware.The controllers feel so nice, but are completely unusable due to the joystick problems.I shouldn't have had so much trust in Microsoft to assume that their $179 controller works.

",1.0,Steven S.,"Reviewed in the United States December 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  Well to begin with, coming out of the box I had High expectations. Paddle positions were great. Short Triggers were great, but it was all too good to be true. I'm doing a review on it now, 2 months after I've received my Elite Series 2 Controller. Maybe the problem would stop eventually. It sure didnt... My Original problem started with the 'A' Button. The button double taps constantly, and when you need it to work or when your just trying to press the 'A' Button, it will either double tap or wont respond at all. I thought it could've been something stuck in the button slot, but i cleaned it and no fix. Kinda had to deal with it since I spent the case on it. Now one of my paddle buttons hasn't been responding when I need it to. This is 2 months of use. My Razer Wolverine ultimate lasted me at least 2 years. I bought that one while i was on my deployment and it went through a lot of abuse. There has been sooooooo many times where i just wanted to just smash Elite 2 Controller and just get a new one. I even believe buying a regular $30-50 xbox controller would've been a better buy than. Aesthetically, the controller looks and feels great, but when the controller is literally killing your mood by not working properly, all it does is make you want to throw it as far as you can. Hoping that it lands on the street, so that it could get run over by a cement truck. Dont waste your money like I did. As much as i want to rage out on the controller, I don't. The problems I had with the controller pre-existed before I even got the controller, and also through wear over time, BUT it has only been 2 months and my paddles are already starting to not work properly.Pro:-feel of controller overall-adjustable analogs-adjustable trigger pulls-remapping of buttons is easy-paddle positions are greatCONS:-defective 'A' button-controller wont last long through normal wear-other buttons starting to not work properly after regular use-paddle buttons aren't responding like they use to. If I'm holding the paddle down, it will cutout as if i had let go of the button-the slightest sweat from palms or if you smudged your hand with whatever food your eating, the controller WILL feel slippery on the rubberized handles. not the biggest con, but definitely bothersomeif I'm spending a decent amount of money on a controller, I'd like to expect some kind of decent quality, but there wasn't anything worth the money spent. I literally bought a brand new controller that was broken from the very start, and over time (not a long time) it really hasn't gotten better. It shouldn't have these wear and tear problems at least for a year, not as soon as i get the dam thing. I don't really expect it to last much longer in my case. I will never buy an elite 2 nor will I ever recommend one to a friend, family, coworker, some random viewer from my stream, or to anyone in that case. I tried to work with it as much as possible in order to BELIEVE it was a good controller, but man, it has gotten to the point where I'm just going to get another type of Xbox controller and just trash this one that i have.Don't waste your money. Even if you don't get the same initial problems I had, the controller wont last long. Getting 1-2 year problems through wear and tear in just about 2 months. spending that kind of cash on a controller, you'd expect it to be a tank, not a paper plane.

    Shockingly bad face buttons and poor quality control
  
",1.0,joshua m kramer-jensen,"Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  For such an expensive controller, the face buttons are shockingly awful, they feel more like the kind you find on cheap third party controllers. They feel slightly mushy, and will often fail to register if you don't press them firmly at the center of the button. They are significantly worse than the face buttons on the standard controller, which is absolutely baffling for additional cost. Maybe this was a defect, but the face buttons failing to register seems to be a common complaint.Personally, I dislike the general feel of the controller. It is much heavier than the standard controller, and I hate the textured grips. The texture felt nice at first, but there is much more friction against my skin, so my palms get hot and sweaty very quickly, which was never an issue with the standard controller.It is worth mentioning that using the paddles and creating profiles on PC REQUIRES a Microsoft/Xbox account and installation of (free) software that can only be obtained from the Microsoft Store.General quality control also seems fairly poor, one of the paddles I received was defective, and won't stay in the slots, and doesn't click properly. It looks identical to the other, so I suspect it wasn't magnetized properly.

  Purchased the controller in May, now it's December and my thumbsticks are already developing crazy amounts of drift and the left one is largely unresponsive. Thought they would fix these issues in gen 2 but apparently not. These issues actually developed faster than my previous Elite gen 1 controller (multiple broken bumpers, unresponsive buttons, stick drift).Really disappointed. It feels really well crafted, and that would lead me to rate it higher than a 1 star but the absolutely obscene price merits nothing more than that.Fortunately they've seemed to upgrade the factory warranty of 90 DAYS!!!!!! to a full year. Just glad I bought this with a card that has additional warranty protection because I'm sure this won't be the only time within the next year I'm submitting a warranty claim.Avoid this controller until they fix these issues

",4.0,I23cl,"Reviewed in the United States November 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  It has some awesome features that the Razer doesn't, however I hate the paddles which is a problem. They are too close together and on the same plane, when I go to switch my weapon I end up holstering on accident because of the travel and lack of tactile feedback. As for the app it's great but I thought switching buttons would be more useful than it is, however on diablo or RPGs the added shift function is probably real nice. The app is my favorite part for sure, the controller feels sturdy and the trigger stops are amazing. The tension adjustment on the sticks are nice but the highest setting doesn't feel right when rotating radially like it stops at the horizontal or vertical axis. Maybe itll be smoother after breaking it in more? The case and dock are really nice but the accessories could be better. The high stick is way taller, almost too tall. The two 360 sticks? Meh... Why not a mid rise xone stick and a mid rise dome stick? I wish all the buttons had a mouse click mechanism because it feels better on the wolverine.Overall I prefer the Wolverine button and trigger feel and placement no contest. The wolverine has two extra trigger buttons on top with mouse click feel that were absolutely the best and I miss them on the Elite so much. I like the Elite 2 stick low and medium tension as well as the xone sticks but not the others. The Elite app is better than razer's. The Razer feels better in the hands to me. I really am trying to get used to the Elite 2 and I'll keep at it but so far I like the Wolvie better, 8.8 points for the Wolvie and 7.2 for the Elite 2. I'll update after a month.

    Controller Longevity

  This controller is by FAR the best controller I have ever used when working properly.  But that's the problem these controllers don't last and even if you buy a warranty good luck getting a good replacement because it's the same recycled controllers that other people are returning for the same problems.  Bumpers on this controller are worse than the Series One version of this controller.  Stick drift is a very common problem with all Xbox controllers this one is 100% better than the regular $60 controllers, but within a year I guarantee you will have a problem if you use this controller more than 4 times a week.  I got this controller delivered to me on September 19, 2020 and its currently January 11, 2021 and finally decided to write a review.  Mid December is when I stopped using this controller because the bumpers don't register and left stick drifts left consistently which throws me off because I play Rocket League.  I had a Xbox One Elite Controller Series One and that controller lasted me 2 years whereas I have been through 3 of these Series Two controllers all in a 2 years.  Truly pathetic and I can't warranty claim them due to the fact that the warranty is only ""90 days"".  If these controllers were warrantied for more than a year Microsoft would definitely be out of business.  All in all don't buy if you want longevity out of your controller otherwise you will be committing to a $180 subscription about every 6-8 months.

Disappointing as the I think the design is great and if it worked as designed it would be a 5 star review.

  Why am I paying for a 200$ controller for again? Oh for it to work, nah just to look at apparently. I bought this controller because I wanted to have a controller that was not cheaply made or flimsy.Except thats not what this controller is. It seems to have the same type of care put into it as a 60$ controller. It works fine, until I play a game where reactions are key like for honor, Call of duty, Dark souls etc. Then for whatever reason when I push a combination of buttons or hold the controller a certain way, it turns off.I have never seen a product that cost so much money, so cheaply made. Yes it is just a controller, but if its just like a 60$ controller why did I fork out more money for a controller that will not even function properly?Do NOT buy this. You would be better off replacing a 60$ controller every couple of months, rather than replacing a 200$ controller every two months. I dont know if I have a defective controller or something, but this is completely unacceptable.

  I am in a bit of shock at how absolutely horrible this controllers wireless capabilities are. First off, Bluetooth is horrendous. It will connect to bluetooth for a quick moment, lag whatever you're playing, then shut off. I've tried updating my drivers, restarting my pc, updated the controllers firmware still nothing. I then went out to bestbuy and bought a wireless adapter hoping it would benefit. The game no longer lags before disconnecting, but will still disconnect very quickly. It's a damn shame this thing costs $180 when it does not even stay connected wireless. Save your money and find another controller to use.

",4.0,Matthew K.,"Reviewed in the United States February 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had the extremely common issue that Microsoft refused to address of the rubber grips coming off my Series 1, as well as a sticky B button. I never liked the traditional controller and felt the Elite series was much more responsive and attenuated. I decided to dive in cash in the Series 2 and don't regret it thus far.The build seems more sturdy, and the charging dock is a nice feature. I don't think the grip problem will occur on this controller as it seems it's more of a coating than an actual rubber grip. The controller also feels more balanced in my hand with just the right amount of weight. I also really like the shorter throw option on the triggers as well as the adjustable tensioner on the joysticks. If you want a solid controller that you'll respect, this is the way to go. 4 stars because it's a 1/3 the cost of a the console, though, if not even more than that.Pros:Seemingly resolves grip separation issues that plagued the Series 1Adjustable joystick tensionShorter throw option on triggersBetter weight distribution in the controllerRechargeable battery with dockCons:PriceyMagnetic pieces are prone to detach under certain circumstances, but not as much as the Series 1

    Fantastic Controller, Poor Component Quality
  
",3.0,Chris Guyman,"Reviewed in the United States July 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  I'm very conflicted about how to review the Series 2. As a controller, it's fantastic, which I'll get into. Unfortunately, Microsoft clearly does not put enough focus into making sure these controllers are built to last.Contrary to the experiences of my others, my original Elite lasted five full years before dieing on me. That made it very worth the price! However, I'm on my third Series 2, as the other two both developed unplayable stick drift in the left stick. One was replaced by Amazon, the other by Microsoft. Note that, while I highly recommend this controller, you'll probably have a much, much better life span from it if you're willing to replace the thumbstick components yourself or through someone else, because Microsoft seems to put very little towards some of the internals.As far as mechanics, I think it's great. I prefer the paddles over the original, they provide a firmer response and are less prone to misclicks. Adjustable thumbstick tension is fantastic, even though the range of tension isn't that huge. At full tension, I think it feels quite nice, but at the lowest tension, it's far too sensitive for me.Though I respect the tiered trigger stops, they're unnecessary for most used, I think. The bottom stop is a very short stop, which many would probably like, though I think the middle one is far better. I don't think I ever realized how much a difference the front facing textures make, they really do feel nice. One weird gripe I have is that the Guide button has been turned from a ""soft"", depressable button to a harder, short click. It's obviously very minimal, to the point where I hardly think of it.I wish they'd improved the directional pad, as I still think the 360's d-pad feels much better. Sometimes it kinda feels like you have to search out the particular spot to press on, because it doesn't come out of the controller much and each arm of the d-pad is rather small. The variant you're offered to change the feel doesn't really help much, either. Fortunately, the triggers, bumpers, face buttons, thumbstick clicks, paddles, and pause / back buttons all feel both familiar and comfortable.It's certainly worth mentioning that the accessories and the controller case are all very quality, and the case in particular is very useful. I would definitely say they're worth whatever extra few dollars they cost you.

  I've ordered this controller a total of 3 times. I had originally ordered 2 controllers, 1 for me, and 1 for my man. The first order arrived with 1 elite series 2 and an obviously worn elite series 1 in a series 2 box so I returned the 1 and reordered the series 2. This time when I opened the box I worried because the package seal was broken so I though they may have sent another series 1. Luckily it was the series 2 we wanted, but it's missing the cord for the charging dock.I understand that these controllers are in high demand, but this kind of quality control is unacceptable.All in all, the controllers themselves are very nice. Lighter than the series 1 with smaller paddles and 3 paddle configuration settings.Only issue I forsee in the future is not being able to switch the batteries out. So if the controller cant hold a charge, I'm assuming I'll have to get a whole new controller unless I'm mistaken.

  Unfortunately, Microsoft didn't seem to learn as much as they claimed to from the Elite Controller 1 debacle. This is obviously a high-end controller that feels nice and has a good weight to it. The paddles on the back are still entirely useless, but otherwise everything is very pleasing to the touch. The problem is, like always, quality control. The face buttons in particular seem prone to error, judging from the reviews, and mine are no different. From day 1, the A and Y button do not work unless pressed harder than one should have to. It's obvious that Microsoft is using the same cheap membrane switches that everybody knows and loves from the regular controllers. I'm going to be returning mine for a replacement, but if that one is also like this, I will just send it back altogether.Poor effort.Update for July 2020I've gone through two returns now. The first one I received had non-functional shoulder buttons, and I just received another replacement that had the same issue as the original, probably worse. I give up. Unacceptable.

  The Elite 2 offers the most advanced features any controller can offer. From it's 2-3 Day battery life for the average gamer or even most competitive, you can count on Xbox to not let you down during those high intense FPS moments of Apex Legends or Fortnite!Features like the button mapping lets you have complete control over every button action as well as four extra paddles on the back. Building in Fortnite never seemed so effortless and swapping weapons or a quick heal while never having to move your thumbs from the joysticks can give you that edge in the heat of a 3v1 situation! Other technical features like the Joystick response curves and hairline triggers allow a complete custom feel so you can get a that perfect shot and quick reflex every single time.Swappable thumbstick and D-pad are included so you can game how you want. whether you need something quick for flicking when doing those quick adjustments in Tony Hawk Pro, or a tall technical stick for Fine aiming for any FPS game. All swappable pieces are magnetic so you never have to worry about losing them.This controller is a bit on the heavy side, but for the amount of features and the battery life I wouldn't expect something light from such a quality build, it never gets tiring holding it and the grip that wraps around the sides back and fourth definitely help. Xbox you outdid yourself and rate this a 10/10

Came to find out they extended the warranty to 1 year. But here it is. Too late. This controller probably has less than 20 hours of use or something and pressing up on the left stick does nothing now and it's out warranty.Just avoid it and buy a regular Xbox One controller.

I noticed after a couple of months of use that this controller's left and right sticks don't snap back to their exact center. Check out the attached photo to see for yourself: those sticks are not centered as detected by Windows, but they're in a totally neutral position from a hardware perspective.Microsoft Support says that the controller would have to be sent away for repairs, and that costs $90. No thank you. The kind support tech also said that some people have solved this by increasing the tension on the sticks. I've tried that, and it doesn't work for me.Stay away from this controller. It's unfortunate that this $180 piece of premium hardware has such a fundamental issue. I expected better from Microsoft.

  Second controller here. First one had the unresponsive A button issue, so I put in for an exchange. The first controller had an issue where frequently button presses of the A button simply would not register while playing games or using a testing app. It typically took a second or several re-presses for it to finally click. The second controller seems to have a similar problem, but I've only been able to reproduce it a couple of times thus far, so it may simply be an issue with breaking in the gamepad, or I just have terrible luck. I'm probably keeping it for the following reasons if I can find a good workaround or fix:The Feel: The controller actually has a solid grip, looks nice, and has a good balance of customization options and tactile response. It's a bit heavier than I like, but the tension adjustments on the joysticks are pretty good, and the interchangeable paddles and thumb-sticks are a really good design decision.Responsiveness: Solid response times when using wired or the Xbox wireless adapter. Bluetooth is no-good however. Signal loss/latency seems to increase when using Bluetooth on multiple devices, even when the controller is right next to the Bluetooth antenna.Being able to remap the paddles (and any other buttons) is a feature I love, but I'd like it if I could remap them to other, non-gamepad buttons. I don't have the largest hands, so the paddles in reach without significantly changing the grip is really nice.

I still have to get used to the paddles but I can already tell my hands will not be cramping as much. The modular nature of the d-pad, paddles, and analog sticks is interesting. Hopefully the R1/L1 bumpers don't become modular unintentionally.I'm most excited about the quality of the d-pad because the various 2D retro-style sidescrollers I enjoy playing truly benefit from that precision that I never really had on other Xbox controllers.Anyway, I plan to update the review if I come across any issues, but my initial thoughts are very positive!

  I had the first Elite controller and I loved it.  It worked like a champ, felt very premium and really was a great controller.  I was very excited when the Elite 2 came out.  It should be the controller I love, but improved and USB C charging which I was looking forward to as well.When I got it, it felt great.  They truly upped their game on how it feels and plays.  It felt like exactly what I wanted.  But this controller has some significant reliability issues.Within 3 months, I was getting SIGNIFICANT drift on both of my joysticks on this.  It was unusable.  I figured I got a lemon, so I reached out to Microsoft support.  They were incredibly unhelpful and just told me to buy another one.  The warranty on these is absolute garbage.  Think a premium controller comes with a premium warranty and is backed by the company that makes it?  Think again.  Buy it again after it just fails after 3 months?  No chance I'm doing that.After explaining the situation to the reseller I bought it from and arguing with them about it I got them to finally replace it for me.  But guess what happens again about 3 months later?  Both joysticks start drifting really badly again.There have been articles out there about how Microsoft has extended the warranty on this controller now because of these issues, but good luck getting them to honor that.  It's honestly been shocking how bad their support has been, and now I've had 2 of these extremely expensive controllers fail on me.Absolute garbage that no one should buy.

And it looks like the series 2 might have a few production problems of its own.The face buttons (and to some degree the home button) are an interesting ""glass like"" smooth shell but their sensors do not attach properly to the control chips - this means that even when the button ""taps"" as if you have registered a button tap but no press is received in game.  It seems like you have to very carefully press down on a 90 degree angle to guarantee the press works, and some buttons (probably based on the angle of your hand) are more prone to this than others.  The A button is by far the worst offender - it fails all the time.Doing some research this also looks like it is an issue that effects many others as well.If not for this 1 critical issue, the product would get 5 stars in a heartbeat.  I really do hope they fix the problem in future batches so fewer people receive duds.

    fatal stick drift within 3 months
  
",1.0,computernut236,"Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  I am literally two days out of warranty and I have absolutely fatal stick drift. The controller acts like I'm pressing the left stick up when I am not. It constantly interferes with games and I have exhausted all the settings options to adjust it - without success. All my Microsoft controllers have eventually developed this issue, but this is the FASTEST ONE. Which is outrageous since the Elite Series 2 is supposed to be the best of the best. My 360 controller lasted years and years before developing problems, and my Xbox One controller made it almost a year. Now this one makes it 3 months? RIDICULOUS. DO NOT BUY.

  I purchased this as a birthday gift for my husband. He really wanted the Elite controller but after learning that Series 2 was coming out he decided to wait. And he's so glad he did. This controller is amazing! He's an avid gamer (Destiny and Monster Hunter are his biggest ones) and this controller allows him to customize everything about his gameplay. He said it was one of the best gifts I've ever gotten him so it deserves 5 stars!!Update 9/24/2020The controller turned off during game play and will not power back on. My husband treats this controller like gold. Very carefully. Never drops it & always puts it away in the case. When he hooks it up to the system wyh the cable only a few buttons show as responding even though the xbox logo on the controller doesn't come on. This is ridiculous. Nearly $200 and just dies in 8 months??? Don't waste your money.

    Best controller money can buy with ONE major flaw
  
",2.0,Tej,"Reviewed in the United States February 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  First of all, it’s a fantastic controller. It has amazing software remapping and the best thing over the Series 1 is the adjustable tension sticks. Also a ton of other features not found om any other controller.However, the analog sticks are incredibly LOOSE, and to compensate there is a very large built-in dead zone. This was the case both units I received from amazon. It is worse than any stock controller I’ve ever used, including the original Xbox one controller. Even my $35 DualShock 4 has sticks that return EXACTLY to the center when released and they don’t wobble at all.There is no competitive gaming situation where a controller with sticks like this is usable. This is absolutely inexcusable for a controller that costs almost as much as the console itself. I’ve returned both the controller and the replacement. Have very little hope in Microsoft’s ability to make a decent controller anymore.

Think ill just get my money back now after reading that so so many other people have the same issues....till this day too! Me and my fiancée both bought one a peice so in total all 4 controllers I've bought here have messed up within a month or 2! No controllers I have ever had messed up this quick. They atleast lasted 2 to 3 yrs with no lag, no issues. Why is something that cost twice as much as a normal controller a peice of trash? Microsoft needs to fix this NOW! I love the controller honestly, I just wish they would've made them right the first time. They say its a bad batch...well must be the whole line because everyone is sending them back, replacing them multiple times, and still have the same problems. I dont even know what to do...risk buying them from the actual site and them having the same issue or go for the scuff. Which I don't like as much as the elite. I just want 2 good working, long lasting elite series 2 controllers  but looks like it isn't happening anytime soon. ☹😖

  I struggled at first trying to connect it to the nintendo switch through the 8bitdo adapter, it turned out I had to get the updated version of the firmware on both the controller and the adapter, after that, it is my favorite controller ever, I was used to the switch controller and always bothered when I tried to play a game on PC because of the button layout difference; this controller solved that, feels good when you hold it (maybe a little too heavy tho), easy to customize with the magnetic joy sticks, and I find really hard to find something to complain about it except for the price, this is a luxury item, you are over paying for what you get, but if this is not a problem for you, don't think about it too much.

  Update: Everything I said below is true but the replacement has now developed “drift” where the left stick pushes right without being touched. Makes some games hard to say the least.For a product this expensive to be so unreliable doesn’t cut it. I took it into the Microsoft Store and they said I’d need to take a video of this happening to prove it. That’s kinda hard!It’s a fabulous controller in so many ways, but life is too short to keep returning the darned thing.I should mention they had some quality control issues with this and I had to try twice before I got one that worked. However, now I have, this thing is just quality.It’s perfectly weighted, all controls feel sturdy and it just, well, feels “nice” to use.No, I haven’t suddenly become a world class video game player, but this does add an extra dimension to gameplay. It wasn’t cheap but my god, I love it!

  It feels really nice, it is lighter than the first controller. There are new options added to the controller that make it more superior than its original generation. The grips feel better too, overall just feels more natural in the hand. However I do dislike that they only send you, one, yes one TALL magnetic stick. Like, why? Some players play with the tall sticks (like me) and without having two of them it feels awkward. You cannot even use the ones from your old elite controller because they are designed different. Other than that, everything feels more tactile too.

  This controller is amazing. Construction is nice and it feels way better in my hand than the regular Xbox controller. The recharge ability with USB C is so nice. I bought this controller in February 2020, and now in July 2020 I am having issues with RB not registering and sometimes double registering. At first I thought it was lag in game, but it is clear that it is the controller and it's getting worse. From what I am reading online this is a common issue. This shouldn't happen for a $170 controller.UPDATE 11/15/2020: The double input from RP and not registering went away for awhile but now it's back worse than ever. Very frustrating.

  Only been couple months and the RB button and A button are starting to stick and not work on occasions.

Feels very worn...I noticed the D pad felt very worn out and loose at first but thought I'd roll dice and keep it. Now I'm stuck with a remote that's ""like new"" but feels years old, with stuck/worn buttons. I take extremely good care of my stuff too, so I know this is not from me. My Series X is my baby (see pictures). I have a feeling this remote was MUCH older than it was listed to be. Would not recommend buying used from here.

  I was tired of getting slaughtered in Battlefield 5, and was told by several of my gaming buddies that this controller would make me more killy.  Well, it does. I also added a high rise Kontrolfreek to the right joystick (the one you aim with) which provides a much higher degree of precision and control when aiming in FPS games. The weight of the controller is nice too. It feels very solid in hand and the texture on the grips helps keep it in place. It has no removable battery, but the battery life in this controller is impressive! Depending on usage, it will last 5 to 7 days without a charge if you play every day like I do. The additional paddles are cool, but I haven't found a legit use for them yet. (I just haven't taken the time to really explore how to use them). Overall, this is definitely the best Xbox controller you can buy.

  I didnt check the length of coverage for this warranty (I SHOULD HAVE) and it is only 90 days.  It says a lot that the company only guarantees a product for 90 days, which means they expect it to break around day 120 and you  can buy a new controller.  However, you can pay 45 dollars and have a 3yr warranty coverage...which also says a lot.  I should have known better I am an IT hardware guru which in this case worked against me because I assumed industry standard by association with MSRP and the microsoft brand.  It just goes to show your mom was right, always read the fine print because while its a great controller it wasnt worth about a dollar a day and now its junk.

    Myriad of issues for a premium price.
  
",1.0,Brandon J Carrigan,"Reviewed in the United States May 25, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had been eyeballing this controller for a while but held off after reading of all the issues the series 1 had. After seeing only brief mentions of the A button sticking and that being a quick fix I broke down and bought one.I didn't have a lot of time to use it initially and after setting it up I only used it sparingly for about a month. When I finally got around to using it in earnest I found the A button frequently didn't register when pressed and would sometimes stop registering as pressed when held in. I was using it on my PC so I fired up the XBox accessories app it uses as well as Windows' built in game controller software to view my inputs. I found that, yes, the A button wouldn't register about 5% of the time it was pressed and when held in it would frequently stop registering if my thumb moved slightly off center. Comparing it to the base XBox One controller the buttons on this model do feel looser. You can notably jiggle them around with your thumb a lot more than I've ever been able to with any controller. I assume this doesn't help.I wanted to just return it to Amazon and recoup my $180 but I had just missed the month-long return window.I registered the controller with Microsoft and it was within warranty. This series had so many problems with it at this point that Microsoft had implemented a no-questions-asked replacement policy with these. So I opened a ticket and sent it off to Microsoft for replacement. The replacement arrived a couple of weeks later. I fired it up, updated the firmware and promptly opened the game controller software to test the buttons. This brand new controller had the exact same issues on the exact same button but it occurred much more often, around 10-20% of presses did not work. Again, I had not even used it at all up to this point and it was worse than the original I had sent in.I sent that one back as well. When the new new one finally arrived I tested the buttons and this time it was better... sort of. Now the A button registers every input which is good BUT the A, B and Y buttons sometimes fail to register as held when your thumb moves while holding them. As I was fiddling with it a brand new issue popped up that was actually the worst one yet. The right thumbstick sometimes feels rough, like something is under it and it will stick way off center. Adjusting the tension on the stick doesn't really do anything. It doesn't happen all the time but every few minutes it feels like a mild grinding/rubbing and the stick will just stick wherever it is. Additionally, its neutral position is always just off of center unless manually adjusted to the middle.I feel completely ripped off. This controller is $180 and you have no guarantee it will work right at all. Even relying on the 90 warranty through Microsoft is a gamble because you might get sent one that is actually worse. And once those 90 days are up you are done (unless you want to spend more money to gamble further). That's where I am. I have a $180 paperweight.

",1.0,Alex,"Reviewed in the United States September 21, 2020","









  
  
    
  This controller is a complete scam, either accidentally through poor engineering or intentionally with planned obsolescence.I primarily used this device to play Rocket League on PC. I play with my boost bound to the left bumper and after only about 5 months the bumper is beginning to fail. Every time it starts acting up, you must remove the faceplate and attempt to clean any dust out around the button and play with the inserts. This must be done several times a day or get used to playing with the faceplate off. Very convenient their warranty is only 90 days as their buttons become unreliable after around 5 months.Pros:- A lot of Customization- Comfortable (mostly)- PC support- Magnetic charging stand- Case and accessoriesCons:- Must connect over USB to configure anything- Reconnecting to Bluetooth after connecting via USB requires removing the controller from Bluetooth devices and restarting your computer- Left bumper failing after 5 months use- Comfort (Get used to playing with the faceplate off for frequent and easy troubleshooting)- Horribly short 90-day warranty and no offer for an extended warranty (By contrast, Razer offers 1 year on all of their controllers even though they're notorious for their terrible quality control. I went through 4 or 5 in a couple of years back in the 360 days.)- Too expensive- Difficult to take apart (Faceplate attached by clips and adhesive, not screws. Screws on the inside are all torx.)- Microsoft wants $100 outside of the 90-day warranty to repair or replace

  Make sure you're comfortable with the warranty terms before forking over almost two hundred dollars for a controller that is made out of cheap plastic parts. Microsoft has limited the warranty to 90 days. Thats 90 days for a controller with a built-in battery and defective bumpers which notoriously break. My controller bumper and trigger came loose after 3-4 months of light usage. Microsoft response is that they've agreed to fix it if I pay an additional one hundred dollars. Thats an additional one hundred dollars to change out the cheap plastic parts on a new controller I paid almost two hundreds dollars for a few months ago. If Microsoft can't guarantee these controllers for at least one year, for how much they're charging,  to me its just isn't worth it.

Also, the charging stand is magnetic (strong), you can charge the controller directly, or set it on the charger, or there’s even a little slot for the cable to go into the case and charge it while it’s closed; they thought through everything.The customization is done directly on Xbox natively, not complicated at all unless you go advanced.Highly recommended.

  I have always enjoyed the elite controllers for the tactile feel and overall design, Elite series 1 was a fantastic controller that unfortunately just was released right before xbox had changed their bluetooth connectivity method. So when Elite series 2 came out I was more than excited to start using it.When the controller is not having issues it is great, it feels good in the hand and the customization options continue the trend to personalize how you play a game. However there are major issues I have found and have been a result within the community you should be aware of: (these are the ones I had experienced)- Sometimes the controller seems to on its own have your screen list lazily to the side. There is some fundamentally issue with how the right joy stick is implemented that seems to make this happen. You dont always notice it unless you stop moving and leave it for a few seconds.- I have had a few times where the controller seems to come apart at the seam. This was a bigger issue for me. I would come up to the controller and for some reason the buttons were sort of falling in and the seem had opened. I was able to push down on it to reseal it but this was a bit odd given I dont drop or toss my controllers.So summary is, if you want a nice feeling controller with customization options but dont mind some of these oddities this can work great. However I do not think it is required if you are okay with your current setup, the price point is a bit extreme given the problems being found with it.

  Update to below review.I returned the original control.  Amazon was extremely fast at getting me a replacement and made it very easy to return the replaced controller.  Unfortunately, that is about the only good thing I have to say.  The replacement controller worked great, but within days minor drift was detected on the left stick.  20 days in and the drift is so bad the controller hardly useable.  The left stick is either unresponsive or drifting.End of Update------------2 stars because the feel of the controller is outstanding, but the operability is bad.I have had this controller for about 1.5 months, and it has been my primary controller for that time (since launch).  The controller feels great.  It has a great weight to it.  The interchanging parts work well depending on play style.  That being said, the left stick drifts horribly.  It is bad enough for me to write this review.  In some games the drift will even cause menu changes.  I have found it to be unusable in games such as the Mass Effect series because the drift causes serious issues in menu mode.  In other games (such as Borderlands 3) the character continues to walk forward or back after I release the thumb stick.  I then have to pull back or forward / adjust on the stick to try to get my character to stand still.  I have not had the controller long enough to check if it has the issues with the previous elite series controller (which I went through three of them, two broke) such as the rubber separating from the plastic or the bumper buttons breaking down.  This controller is very much overpriced for the quality of the product in my opinion.  I purchased this controller hoping that the issues from the series one controller were fixed, but seemingly out of the box I have had the drift issue.  I have not yet contacted support but will update depending on how that conversation goes.  I recommend against this controller at this point in time, but also understand I may have a lemon.

  I've used an original elite controller for a couple years, and while I haven't really had any issues myself, I have heard second-hand of people having issues. Now with the series 2, I started seeing an issue where it would randomly lose the wireless connection to the Xbox and the Xbox would pop up a message: ""please reconnect the controller"". The controller stays on the whole time, but after holding down/pressing down the guide button, it'll re-pair/sync after a few moments. Terrible when it happens mid-game/mid-fight. I wanted to get repaired under warranty after 3-4 months after buying it, but that was around feb/march and didn't think/want to bother support with this sort of thing then. So I waited a little longer but then happened to check the warranty: for some reason I thought it was (at least) 1 year, like almost all higher end electronic items I'm familiar with, but then I thought I found out it was only 6 months and mine was over that already anyway. On top of that, it looks like it might be 90 days now too, which is so ridiculous, I don't even know what to say.Microsoft, you had a history of elite 1 controllers breaking, you then carried this trend (and maybe even worse) to the elite 2, AND we only have 90 day warranty now on a $180+ premium controller?

  So I’ll start saying I love the controller it definitely improved gameplay. However this would be a 5 star review if it worked properly after minimal use I’ll explain. Got the controller and for probably 1-2 days there was a learning experience curve between games and adjustments and settings probably about 6 hours of game time in total per game. So for multiple games definitely a time investment but between the games definitely worth it especially higher paced competitive games. My low review comes from I had the absolute worst stick drift Iv ever experienced with a controller and stick drift is why I decided to finally buy a high end controller. Microsoft is replacing my controller but it’s been 3 weeks and they just shipped it out to me with a 2 week wait time for shipping. Because Iv already passed my learning curve for the games I play COD rocket league Forza and PUBG. I don’t play them because I don’t want to deal with The readjustment time.

  A definite improvement on the series 1. The wrap around grip feels great in your hand. The paddles are shorter than the series 1 so they give you more space to grip the controller. Or, if you are like me and you don’t use your fingers to hold the controller, you can buy series 1 paddles which are easier to reach. They will fit the series 2 perfectly. I was concerned that the tall stick was too tall and spent a while looking for a medium stick, but it turns out the tall stick is easy to get used to. I would encourage everyone to at least give it a try. It does seem expensive, but it is a huge improvement over the standard controller. Definitely worth the price if you spend a decent amount of time holding a controller.

    Button presses fail to register, right out of the box
  
",1.0,TJM,"Reviewed in the United States November 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  I ordered this controller because I have osteoarthritis in my hands and the hair trigger switches allow me to pull the triggers much easier, without having full range of motion in my index fingers.  The four additional paddles on the underside of the controller also give me options for remapping buttons that I have a hard time pressing.  I was really looking forward to this controller for these reasons.Unfortunately, all of that functionality is completely negated by the fact that buttons on the face of the controller, particularly the A button, intermittently fail to register when pressed.  I'm not sure how you can call this an ""elite"" controller, when it can't even do what my 25-year-old antique Nintendo controller can still do, which is register a simple button press consistently.After a little researching, this appears to be a common issue with poor build quality and there are many reports of buttons not registering and other issues.  If this were a $30-$40 controller, I'd cut Microsoft some slack.  However, it's a $180 ""premium"" gaming accessory and this kind of issue just isn't acceptable, especially right out of the box.UPDATE #1:The longer I have this controller, the more issues I am finding.  Some buttons are registering double presses on a single press.  In addition, the controller doesn't work properly via Bluetooth.  When I first hooked it up, pressing the A button while connected via Bluetooth would adjust my volume and press F12 (at the same time).  I updated the firmware, which seemed to fix that issue.  However, pressing RB in game causes the display output to temporarily freeze up.  If you intend to use this via your PC's built in Bluetooth, or a non-Xbox adapter, you may be sorely disappointed.UPDATE #2:  Received a replacement and it's defective as well, with several buttons that stick or don't register when pressed.  Might even be more defective than the first one.  The level of quality control on these is pathetic.  Microsoft should honestly be ashamed.  At this point, I don't know if I just keep requesting replacements until I get one that works, or give up and find another controller solution.

  I used to buy Scuff controllers because I loved having my buttons on the bottom of my controller.  I finally pulled the trigger and I was really surprised how much I liked this controller. The hair line triggers are great and I think my favorite part would be the option to tune the sticks. I have them tightened and the controller almost feels like the Xbox 360 sticks. Absolutely love the customization ability of this as well. You can also set up multiple profiles so you can switch between games without skipping a beat. I used this on my Xbox Series X, mostly for Halo and COD.

  I really want to like the new XBox Elite Series 2 controller but it doesn’t seem to be much improved over the original Elite controllers. They increased the price over the original Series 1 but it doesn’t seem that they improved the joystick micro switches at all. The left joystick has already started experiencing stick drift within the first few weeks and the A and B buttons sometimes seem to miss registering that they’ve been pressed. On the plus side, XBox seems to have improved the LB and RB bumpers and the controller has a very quality feel and weight to it. Wireless recharging and the internal battery pack are an added plus but everything is soured by the problem with stick drift at such an early stage of ownership. I wish XBox would’ve done more testing to fix the problem.

  I really wanted this go around to be better. I loved my original elite controller but like everyone else the bumpers failed just after the short 3 month warranty expired. So how does the elite v2 do? It is a marginal improvement in every way except now they are plagued with unresponsive button presses. Right out of the box I noticed my ""B"" button wasn't perfect, it had to be pressed more firmly to register or it would think I was rapidly tapping it. Annoying for a $160 controller, but not a deal breaker. Then, just a week after the pathetic (and red flag) 3 month warranty, the right bumper stops registering presses unless I hit it firmly. Using the accessory app to test, even firm presses are registering as quick rapid taps which shows something is breaking down internally. A complete redesign of the bumpers in v2 and they STILL fail.In Short: Another failure by Microsoft. Don't get me wrong, if this controller was built well it would be the best one out there bar none. However, MS or their manufacturer (or both) are cutting corners somewhere for a ""premium"" item and their lack of a meaningful warranty shows they are well aware of it.

  These controllers are fantastic when they work, the problem is they don't work for very long. I've had 2 of them already, and both of them developed severe problems with the left stick that make it very difficult to play the games I want to play. Every Xbox controller I've had for several years has developed a drift in the left stick, but these Elite 2 controllers are even worse. Not only do they drift, but they become unresponsive. Push it up and doesn't go up. It's frustrating. These controllers are way better than normal ones, but yet they're so much worse once the left stick stops working properly. Don't want to go back to normal controllers, but also don't want to keep buying one of these every 6 months. Tough choice.

  I liked the feel of the controller, the tensions settings were great.  The paddles are easier to use than my SCUF elite kit on the Series one controller.  I really had no complaints for the first two months or so.  The the RB button would work intermittently, and it would lose connection every so often.  Then it would not stay connected no matter what.  Would show full charge but would disconnect every 5 minutes and turn off.  Checked on warranty status and I had owned it 100 days.  of course the warranty is only 90.  Instead of being out 180 bucks I have to leave it plugged into a phone charger and I have the RB button mapped to a paddle.  Oh yeah, almost forgot one of the paddles doesn't work either.90 days is hardly enough time for problems to arise, the warranty is a joke.  Had the warranty been 1 year and it got fixed/replaced, I would chalk it up to my luck getting a dud controller.  The fact that it is only 90 days, they know problems will arise and they don't want to be on the hook.

  It's a heavy, solid controller that feels good in the hands and has magnetically attached joysticks D-pad, and paddle buttons underneath.The triggers both have 3 mechanical settings for depth of depression.My only real gripe is that the package wasn't complete. Or at least I don't feel it was for the price point.It only came with one set of the interchangeable buttons. So ontop of paying $160 or so I'd have to pay more if I wanted different buttons...I just don't see why the buttons aren't already included in the package I mean they Realistically shouldn't cost more than a nickel each to manufacture and purchase at wholesale b2b pricing.

  This controller is absolutely fantastic. The feel is grippier than the first controller. A built-in battery and charger makes it much easier to use and store.

I actually prefer the heft of the older controller.

    UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM. Non responsive

  **4 MONTH UPDATE AT THE BOTTOM:**Tbh not really worth the price. It would be more worth it if it were about $120. The back paddles feel squishy after a while, if you drop your controller the attachments go flying everywhere, if you like playing wired, the wire is obnoxiously long and even if you want to use another wire its not the same as the regular xbox controllers. But overall its a better price than the scuf. For a maxed out scuf its about twice as much as the elite 2 and the elite 2 already has what a maxed out scuf has.*UPDATE*The left bumper on the controller is non responsive which is a COMMON problem for either bumper and microsoft still doesnt do anything about it. I only spent 4 months using it and barely even use the left bumper for it to just be nonresponsive. This controller is 100% not worth its price. Its just a normal controller given extra of the same buttons harder case and a few features. If you're going to buy this controller without warranty honestly its not even worth it. Especially if you're an advanced player. The left bumper is non responsive, the silicone/rubber covers on the trigger stopper switches fall off easily, and the paddles feel mushy instead of clicky after a while. Amazon couldnt do anything about it. I tried to send it back to get a replacement which would be fair right? No. They said they couldnt do anything about it. Bought it may and return expired june. Not much time for something to not work correctly anymore. I would have no problem sending in my controller and getting ATLEAST a refurbished one.

I purchased this controller less than 6 months before I had the issue and submitted a request for replacement.Buying a $150+ controller and having it break down 6 months later with no option for a replacement or repair is very disappointing.

But the elites series controller improves on the first one. Lighter weight the gripes are better. You can tell they won’t come off this time. It has a share button and a internal battery. The internal batter is the only thing I don’t like. Because what do you do when it doesn’t hold a charge properly. You have to then plug it in with the cable. I don’t know if you can send it in to have the battery replaced. If not then it’s a new controller which is a waste of money. But right now it’s a great controller easy to grip won’t fall out your hands and responsive.

",3.0,Paul,"Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  This controller's build quality is generally excellent.Pros:* The analog sticks have variable resistance that is stiff near the center for precise control, but looser toward the edges which makes them easier to hold in place at full tilt.* The beveled d-pad has faces in the corners which make pressing the diagonals reliably a cinch - no doubt a boon for fighting games.* Of the controllers with paddles I've owned (PowerA Fusion, Razer Wolverine Ultimate, and I guess the Steam controller), the Elite Series 2 has just about the best - they're small enough that they don't get in the way or make your grip less comfortable, but are placed so you can hit them quickly no problem. They -can- fall out by accident, but not often or easily.* Has the best adjustable-depth triggers on any controller I've used. At all depth settings they have a springy bump when you bottom out that gives positive tactile feedback: something other controllers I've tried lack.* Ergonomics are pretty good - the grip is comfortable and the controller doesn't weigh too much.Cons:* The face buttons (X, Y, A, B) are the same as the stock Xbox One's wireless controller's, and on mine they were appreciably worse. They would sometimes stick and also wouldn't pick up light/quick presses reliably, which is a problem I've yet to have on any other controller.* On PC, the Elite Series 2 -requires- you to create or sign in to a Microsoft account to program the paddles or adjust any other settings. When you sign in to use the app, it also signs you in to every Microsoft service present on Windows. Personally, I just want to program the hardware I bought and own, not volunteer myself as a donor of personal data to Michaelsoft's me-too attempt at surveillance capitalism.The cons make the controller a no go for me. Save for not being wireless, the Razer Wolverine Ultimate is, in my opinion, comparable to or better than the Elite Series 2 in every way. Razer's controller software doesn't require a login to use, you can program paddles directly on the controller without it, and it has two extra paddles on the shoulders.

  For a premium price, you expect a premium product.  At first glance, you think you're getting that.  The controller has good heft and all the components feel like high-quality parts.But that's where the good news ends.  Here are all the issues my controller encountered.1. The right trigger (RT) started to have a weird click when bottoming out.  Whereas the left trigger is still soft like it was on day 1.  This problem started happening probably a week after light use.2. The A button doesn't register sometimes.  It seems to be based on the angle where I press the button but this same issue has never occurred on my regular Xbox One controllers.3. The right bumper (RB) will frequently register a double-click and cause multiple inputs even when I physically only feel one click.I see lots of complaints about stick drift but fortunately I have not experienced this.The A button issue was present from day 1.  The RT trigger issue cropped up probably around the 50 hour usage mark.  I don't know when the RB issue started happening but I only recently noticed it due to a game I recently started playing that was sensitive to double-inputs.The worst part is I didn't really use the controller heavily enough to realize how intolerable all these stacked issues were until I was outside the short 90-day warranty period to get a replacement.  So now I'm stuck with a controller that I would hardly call ""Elite"" or gives me a good gaming experience.

  Have a series 1, it has stick drift and the bumper button is broke. Bought this series 2, straight from the box the ""A"" button sticks, and also the right joystick drifts towards the left, and there was some white powder stuff on the grips. It was brand new, sealed.Did not receive 2 of the ""long"" joysticks like the series 1, it only came with 1 long joystick. I tried to put the long joysticks from the series 1 onto the series 2, they are not compatible - go figure.I read that this controller was supposed to be better for big hands, this is not the case. I have to grip the controller completely differently, lower on the grips with my pinky fingers not even touching anything. My hands were actually sore from holding this controller, I haven't had sore hands like this since the original NES with the sharp corners... If I hold the controller comfortably, then I cannot use any of the rear buttons (they will just be smashed). I have to grip the controller using my palms, with my fingers floating over the buttons (hold your hand as if you are talking with a sock puppet, this is how I have to grip the controller). IMO If I can't use the rear buttons then there is no reason to own this controller.

  Very nice controller, fits in my hands perfect.When I first got this controller my greatest fear was realized - one of the buttons stuck.

Although it has 2 less “extra buttons” than the wolverine, it’s not as clunky. The paddles are easier to use albeit a little hard to get used to after using a different controller for so long, but now it’s second nature.I love love love the imbedded, rechargeable battery that comes in the controller. I don’t have to buy double A’s anymore I just lay in on it’s charger after I get done playing and it’s ready to go and fully charged the next time I play. It’s never ran out of juice for me yet but I don’t play more than 4-5 hours at a time. The battery is suppose to last 40 hours of continuous gameplay fully charged, which is crazy awesome!The grips are nice, the feel of the controller is comfortable.One of my favorite parts is the ability to change ANY of the buttons to ANY button of your choosing.

    Best Xbox controller as of 2020
  
",5.0,B-Man,"Reviewed in the United States December 5, 2020","









  
  
    
  This is the best controller that I’ve ever held, and ever heard of hands down. I originally got a trial controller that I busted fairly quickly because of my own stupidity. Slamming the controller down and walking away to cool off was just enough to dislocate the left analog stick beyond repair. After this purchase, I’m a lot more cautious and after having used this controller for a total of about a year now, I can definitely say it’s a quality premium controller. If you’re prone to rage during your gaming sessions you’ll want to be able to think before you act with this controller because it is fragile. The grips are satisfyingly comfy, the dpad is metal which makes every click enjoyable, the bumpers are not metal even though they look like they are (imo they should be metal), I don’t use the analog stick sensitivity adjustment nor the trigger toggle but I can see how people would enjoy that feature, the manual customization through Xbox’s accessories app is AMAZING and I love being able to customize the vibration strength, aim sensitivity presets, Xbox logo LED strength, and the name for the controller itself. The interchangeable analog sticks is what really sold me on this controller. I actually find myself swapping analog sticks for different games to suit my comfort level, not because I need to but because it’s easy and makes a difference for me personally. Considering how long this controller has been out I’d actually advise you to look into the Elite Series 3 controller, depending on when you’re reading this. The only reason I say that is because of the change from the first Elite controller to the Elite Series 2 being a strong upgrade, I can’t even imagine what another upgraded version would look like. In summary, as long as you treat this controller like your baby, clean regularly, keep away from excessive moisture, and NEVER drop or throw this controller, it will satisfy most gamers.

  Fantastic build quality, options, and utility.Pros: Battery life is good, though I use my plugged in almost always. The internal battery makes this heavier for me because I used the Elite series 1 plugged in with an empty battery bay, but the weight isn't too bad.Customization is great. Maybe too good for the average gamer, but the average gamed probably wouldn't drop over $100 for a controller. Microsoft includes options to completely re-map the controller, a 3-stage trigger lock, a 100 point trigger control (when to begin sensing a pull and when to reach 100%--highly recommend setting this to the point you've locked your trigger to, e.g. if you lock your trigger to 50% of a pull, tell it to consider a 50% pull as a 100% of a pull. In Destiny 2, for example, you'll never be able to drive your sparrow at full speed if you don't do this or deal with hitting the trigger switch every time you get on/off.)Custom joystick curves are amazing if you spend the time fine-tuning them, but you'll NEVER be able to use another controller again. Be warned.Cons: I don't enjoy that the paddles are significantly smaller on this version than the series 1. In fact, I use the 2 lower series 1 paddles on the series 2. Most people wouldn't have an issue with this, and it actually makes it easier to set your controller down on a soft material without accidentally pressing buttons, like putting your controller down on a couch cushion.Note: the bumpers have been changed for the newer, more durable version on this controller. I only had to replace mine once on my old one, but these even feel much more solid. As for the grip concern, I've never had an issue with any xb1 controller. I don't grip my controllers super firmly, or try to pull my controller in half when I lose a game, so they've never slid or peeled on any controller for me. These seem to be even better than the series 1 controller I own which had several thousand hours of play time on it and never came apart, but if you have noticed that you grip your controllers very hard, you may have issues.

  I just got the controller today and have used it for a few hours now playing Modern Warfare. Controller is great, superb build quality, even more customization than the first Elite controller and has some great new features. One can now have 3 custom profiles plus one more if you include the default preset, one can even map not just buttons to the paddles but functions such as recording clips and one can even adjust the tension of each joystick. I have to say Microsoft has outdone themselves and have went beyond what the first Elite had to offer in every way, which I have had since its launch 4 years ago, and is truly one of if not the best controller one can buy. Highly recommend.

  Casual gaming on PC.  Better feel and responsiveness than the standard Xbox controller.  Mind you, the standard controller is very well made in my opinion, and replacements for the wear parts are readily available online.  The battery has not let me down and I do appreciate the included charger which nests inside the case allowing you to charge while storing the controller.  The adjustability is excellent.  Do note that you must use the PC Xbox accessory app to adjust the majority of the settings.  The X, Y, A, and B buttons would fail to register on occasion (very annoying for FPS) when the controller was brand new.  This diminished after a few gaming sessions and I have not seen the problem return in months, not once.  For reference I purchased before release.  I did install a firmware update right out of the box, before using the controller.  The overall quality of materials, fit, and finish is excellent.  It has a solid well built feel that is a tad on the heavy side, but very manageable.  I generally take very good care of my electronics, and there are no noticeable signs of wear at this time several months into ownership with moderate use.

  This is a mighty upgrade from the first elite controller, the best thing Microsoft added is the Type-C charger with the docking port. It's just so useful now. The quality feels great and well made. There is a drastic difference between the normal Xbox controller to this one. I'm just a typical gamer, but oh-boy, this screams premium all over. I just owned it for 2 days and so far I just can't find any cons to it. The built-in battery might be an issue down the road, but I don't think that will be a huge problem for at least a few years. By then, you'll probably be using a series 3. Microsoft has said it will be compatible with the next-generation consoles, so that's a bonus.And also did I mention this controller can now be charged from inside the box holder?

  So I have been using this controller for a week now. I have played Apex, COD, and Overwatch using this controller, each having their own settings. The paddles are nice, even though I did purchase a set from the older Elite Series 1 just so I can have four long paddles instead of the short ones (it just works better for my fingers). However, my main and only real complaint is....the main buttons A, B, X, Y they all either stick or don't respond to the touch. This has gotten me killed a couple of times since I am not fully used to using my paddles yet. I don't know if this is a software or hardware issue but I know I am not the only one who has had this issue.Other then that, this paddle is great.

  This controller has made me never want to buy or use a different controller. I play from PC now, and primarily use this controller for RPGs, like Assassin's Creed and other similar games. It's comfortable, has a reassuring weight, and the triggers have completely changed how I play. I highly recommend this controller to anyone, as I fully think it is worth the high price. I did not experience any of the issues experiences by other customers, such as sticky buttons or any wear and tear after a couple of months of use.Update: After a couple hundred hours of use, this controller is still working terrifically. I have zero complaints, and still can't consider ever using a different controller again.

  So like many others are writing I too got a defective one where the A button requires a hard push in order to register which is unacceptable. There is no reason that Microsoft should be having any of these kind of quality issues especially with a top of the line $180 controller. My guess is they pumped these controllers out without any testing to verify that they are in working order. Don't get me wrong, these controllers are actually amazing in terms of build and feel, I actually do prefer it over my elite 1 but it cannot have defective buttons.. I'll take the crappier older version with buttons that work 100% of the time over a newer model with an A button that only registers 50% of the time.

  This controller costs too much money for every button activation to not register precisely every time. I bought this for my son in early July 2020 and already end of August 2020, the LB button misses activations or double activates (registers as two clicks). He is very careful with it and has always stored it in the case it came with. He’d be happier with $180 of AA batteries. Google this problem before ordering, you’ll see plenty of other people have a similar issue.

  Easily the best Xbox controller ever.You can immediately feel the quality of it when handling it. I use it exclusively on PC, and it works perfectly anywhere an Xbox controller works. The spider leg things are nifty, but I haven't been able to figure out how to really make the best use of them. I got the Microsoft program that lets you basically map the other controller buttons to it, but I would ideally like to map keyboard buttons to it. I haven't really dug into it very much, but I imagine that may not work too well since games are usually controller or keyboard and mouse, and not a mashup of the two, so the game itself may act oddly.I am quite careful with my electronics, but I could imagine a lot of people losing those little spider leg paddles if they aren't careful.Between this and my steam controller, I rarely have to switch to a dedicated keyboard and mouse unless I want to.

I wished the low score reviews weren't true.But they were. The ""A"" button was sticky and the left bumper was loose. One thing I didn't expect was how heavy the controller was. Also, while the rubber grips are a great touch, your hands get pretty warm (sweaty) after holding the controller for a lengthy period of time.They advertised improvements over the 1st gen Elite controllers. This feels just as bad.Already returned.

  You pay the extra money to not deal with issues and all i have ever had with this thing is issues.  Yeah the packaging is nice.  Yeah the feel is nice.  But for what its supposed to actually do and be, a premium controller, it is not.  They should have spent more money the actual main controller components instead of the look and feel of the thing.First off, the buttons stick.  Everyone I have tested right out of the box the buttons stick.  You roll from one button to the other? One button is going to get stuck down.  Its not a bad batch...its all of them, and if you got one that isnt stick that much then you got one that was used.  Q-tip with some rubbing alcohol on the buttons helped a little with that issue.2nd issue, and the biggest issue of them all right now...the LB and RB buttons double click.  this isnt a patch or a firmware issue.  this isnt a take apart and clean issue.  the buttons themselves are faulty and have to be replaced.  They are completely unreliable and useless on the controller and no fix at all for them.  Complete waste of money.Some other issues, all the sticks on them wobble which means you cant have a low deadzone without having ""drift"".  Fine for most users, but none of the pro users are going to like it at all.  Yeah increase the deadzone but seriously THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A PRO CONTROLLER NOT A CHEAP 20 DOLLAR CONTROLLER.  Like I said, looks and feels good but doesnt do at all what its supposed to.

  Edit: After having it for awhile I have to reduce the rating to 1 stars.  The buttons stick randomly and the bumpers and triggers will just randomly not work. Great concept and an improvement over the original but functionality is a problem.Three things...1. The software to setup profiles on Windows is nice. Setup is easy and switching profiles is simple. Trouble can happen if the game you play has internal settings for Xbox (I have to leave “Xbox controller support” OFF in Steam).2. It is a bit heavy. If you like that or not, it is what it is.3.  The battery is rechargeable and INTERNAL (not replaceable). It comes with the charging “stand” that is a really small, LIGHTWEIGHT base. I mention this as a warning as it can stay attached (magnetically I think) to the controller, and fall after you lift the controller. This is my only reason for it not getting 5 stars from me.GG

For those who play FPS no more melee..So I made the mistake of buying a brand new elite controller. Again, worked great at the start and after about 6 months the right bumper again became unresponsive.The xbox elite series 2 controller is by far the worst controller I've ever used.

  The controller’s customization is awesome and the possibilities are endless. I can see how it can give you an edge across different genres. So I was in love, For about 4 weeks.. then I started noticing consistent left stick drift. I tried resetting profiles, updating the controller, using it plugged in but Nothing fixed it.Worse then that, if the controller is left untouched for a minute or two, the d-pad freaks out until you move the left stick.Microsoft is willing to exchange but I’ll be waiting 10-14 days for a replacement which hopefully doesn’t have the same issues. For $180 the headache isn't worth it. Apparently the drift issue is way too common.  I’ve been super careful with the controller and still I ended up with a defective controller.If the issue started during the return period I’d definitely just return it and keep using my regular Xbox controller.Hopefully you all have a better experience.

    A DETAILED REVIEW ON THE CONTROLLER
  
",5.0,Samuel Weisgerber,"Reviewed in the United States March 14, 2021","









  
  
    
  This controller is a game changer. I mean that literally.Packaged took about 6 days to ship, fairly quick shipping. It was handled with care.I primarily play FPS games like COD and APEX Legends, and I bought this controller hoping for its quicker draw and fire times (hair triggers) for quick scoping and for its customizable stick sensitivity. Well, I got it set up (nothing special was needed, I connected it like any other controller with the Bluetooth) and got on COD. I was absolute dog water all day using the controller. I had adjusted the settings on the sticks and the hair triggers to be more sensitive than my original controller, but only by about 30%, so that I could still play without it feeling completely foreign. After another 2 days playing with the same settings I’m cracked again. It just took some getting used to. Overall, I believe this controller has improved my gameplay by quite a bit. My stats have gone up over the last week, even after the first 2-3 days of getting wrecked while getting used to the new settings. On another note, the rechargeable battery is very convenient. To Xbox gamers who play everyday for extended periods of time, like myself, we all know how expensive it is to be buying batteries every other week, or how annoying it is to put your rechargeable battery’s in the charger every night. All I’ve got to do with this is just set it on its stand when I’m done and it charges. They claim 40 hours of battery life, and I believe it. I played with the controller for 11 hours straight yesterday (I admit with some shame) and the controller battery icon on the Home Screen said full. Neat. Lots of people in the reviews complain about having sticky keys or sticks, haven’t noticed any of that. The A key seems to need a firm press, but I got used to it pretty quickly. So, to wrap this up, is this worth $250? Yeah it is. Stop thinking about it just buy it, maybe if you do I won’t make your K/D go negative next time you’re in my lobby.

  Pros: Shipping was quick and on time. The controller itself is outstanding. Superb build quality, great ergonomics, customizable. I really enjoy the controller.Cons: First and foremost, there are to buying options that were available at the time I purchased. $165 for a used (great condition) or $205 new. I opted for the new. The controller delivered was a used product. The factory seal on the controller box itself was cut open. The controller had already been ""customized"" (buttons can be swapped), a few very minor blemishes and the controller had a bug that when you pressed the ""A"" Button (aka button 2) the controller also pressed the ""Xbox"" button (aka button 13). I assume that's why this unit was probably returned. Since I purchased new but received a used device I took away 2 stars. I took another star away because the controller appears to have had an issue, and was shipped with that same issue.Notes: The fix for the controller was a firmware update, which did require the Xbox accessory app from the Microsoft store. Once the updated controller worked beautifully and have had no issues so far. I will not, however, adjust the rating since the stars I removed were due to the reasons above.TL:DR Controller is amazing! Definitely recommended even at the price point it's at.

  Like the headline says bought this when it was on sale and under the impression that the condition would be new. It wasn't and as a matter of fact it didn't even come in its original box. The other person still had settings attached to the controller when I paired it to my xbox. Besides my slight annoyance to that still stuck with the controller. The good news is that it feels great! Bad news is that after only having it for a few days I noticed the left stick was drifting. Seems this is still a problem with certain batches of controllers. If it weren't for the stick drift I would highly recommend this controller. Lucky I have two (second one was a gift) so this one that isn't working as well will just be used as a backup.

I didn’t plug it in to test due to the condition of it.The controller does feel great in the hands.  Weighty and solid.  But it seems to have major QC issues, that I never had with myFirst elite controller.Maybe I’ll get one down the road, but only at a retail location where I can take it out right there before I leave to inspect it.Too many issues surrounding this controller...

  Great controller. It is rather expensive so some people might not want to buy it and that is understandable. If you have a working normal elite I would not upgrade. The only real differences I’ve noticed are the elite 2 having easier to use paddles (which I don’t use because it’s really hard to get used to), probably some hardware and durability upgrades, and an internal battery. If batteries are a problem, you could really just get rechargeable ones. They’re amazing.But. If you’re like me and you’re upgrading to the elite series two from a normal Xbox one controller or Xbox one s/x, then I’d say go for it. Normal controllers for me always get stick drift after a few months and they become unusable. I’ve had this one for only a little over a month but it’s really incredible compared to a normal controller. The new d pad isn’t crazy useful except for games where you can make really nice combos with it, and the internal battery actually lasts a while and is convenient to charge. I don’t use hair trigger locks or paddles a lot though. They just don’t help me very much. But it’s probably different for everyone.All in all, I would go for it if you currently are using a normal $60 Xbox controller. If you already have a perfectly working elite series one, however, I would just stick with that as there really aren’t huge differences. Hope this helps! Leave a comment if you have questions.

  It's so unfortunate that something that feels so great works so poorly. A simple Google search and you will see this controller has been plagued with issue. I took a chance hoping that Microsoft had patched the bluetooth issue and the 'A' button sticking was an early batch issue. It's not fixed. My 'A' button sticks so much I just had to use the paddles, a number of times in Fallen Order I died because Cal didn't jump when I pushed 'A' lol so that alone is enough to return it. Then there's the bluetooth issue. As many others have found, it's an issue with this controller. I updated drivers, windows, removed all other bluetooth devices, it didn't matter, this this would disconnect after playing for 5 minutes. I know this is a software/firmware issue, because if you connect the controller and don't do anything it will stay connected indefinitely. You also can't configure the controller over bluetooth, so you connect the cable, configure the controller, then it breaks the link. You have to remove the controller and re-sync it, every time.I wanted so badly to love it, and maybe it works well on Xbox (if you get an 'A' button that works) but if you're getting this for a PC save yourself time and money.

  It worked great for about 14 months but how one of the bumpers is not responding 100% of the time as well as one of the panel buttons.  It’s a know problem with the elite 2, what’s worse is it’s out of warranty and Amazon offered zero options at the time for extended warranty.  I have contacted all the local repair places and they will not service it. Best Buy would service it if I had geek squad on it, that requires it to be purchased through them.  Microsoft will not repair even if I pay ?? I guess I’m out $180, ridiculous considering the price.

  The controller is a solid build. It feels great in the hands. I bought it to use with my pc. The problem it has is it keeps disconnecting from the Bluetooth connection every 10 mins or so. I updated the controller to the latest firmware but it still has the issue. This controller costs nearly $200 for it to be acting this way. I really want to keep it but I’m going to return it instead.

  I bought this elite 2 remote for my husband as a Christmas gift but he intercepted the Amazon box and opened it so he got a early Christmas gift. Yes i started Christmas shopping in October. I have to i have 4 kids and 2 are high school teens. Anyway he really loves this remote and after initially charging it fully he has been able to play 4 days before it needs to charge it again. And he plays A LOT. He is a submariner in the military so when he is able to be home this is his downtime.  We would definitely recommend this remote. It has a nice case for it to be stored in.

    Does not work when another bluetooth device is in use
  
",1.0,Jesse,"Reviewed in the United States November 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  I started out plesantly surprised by the feel of this controller and immediately began playing. I was completely happy for all of one hour until I turned on my headset and hopped into a chat with a buddy to discuss this controller. The elite series 2 controller immediately disconnected from bluetooth and attempted to reconnect, multiple times. This controller and from what I read via support forums all elite series 2 controllers have a glaring issue in that they do not work when another bluetooth device is being used on PC. This seems like a silly issue, considering a normal xbox one controller doesn't have this issue. This problem has existed since this controller has released with no fix.So to be clear, a simple but common use case of using bluetooth headphones and this controller simultaneously causes the controller to disconnect every 5 seconds and become completely unresponsive.To me, this is completely unacceptable and is pretty indicative of major problems with QA or long-term support for an expensive luxury product and I wouldn't recommend this controller even if your use case did not overlap with mine.

",4.0,GRYGU,"Reviewed in the United States November 19, 2019","









  
  
    
  The most noticeable improvement is the joysticks and their adjustable sensitivity--its leagues better than V1. The controller is noticeably lighter. The build quality on the whole is better. The included charging cradle is an excellent addition.My only complaints: V2 is slightly smaller than V1 which is a pain for my large hands and they got rid of the grippy material on the handles. Now there is a ""knurled"" texture at the grips but it's the same plastic material as the rest of the controller. This material is not great for sweaty hands. Moisture stays on the surface of the controller and makes it feel slippery. The old grips absorbed some moisture and just felt ""grippier.""

  I used the Series 1 for several years and while a great controller, using the paddles was a bit difficult. They were a hair trigger and so it was quite easy to either miss inputs or enter inputs at the wrong time. The paddles on the Series 2 are much better designed and not nearly as sensitive. The built-in Bluetooth connectivity is also great and avoids the use of a secondary USB wireless adapter. Grip is comfortable and the overall weight of the controller is great - feels nice and light. The storage case and charging mount are sleek and easily fit into any gaming setup aesthetic.

  So, It's currently December 3rd 2020. The controller has no sticky buttons. Everything works as it should. I have no stick drift. I've been using it for about 2 months. No issue. Now, the only thing I warn of, each controller will have different thumbstick sets. Well, I got 3 of one kind and 1 of the kind I like. While the other 2 were the taller ones. I prefer the smaller sized thumbsticks and I only recieved one in the box. Sucks. But I bought Kontrol freaks anyways. The controller itself has no visible issues that I can tell you of in the 2 months I have had it. Works great. Syncs up, no issue of it disconnecting. Battery charges just fine. Love the controller. As a competitive player I prefer this over the version 1 elite and any other controller for xbox.

    LEFT CONTROLLER JOYSTICK DRIFTS/DOESN'T READ MOVEMENT CORRECTLY. MICROSOFT WON'T HELP
  
",1.0,ExtraMileLLC,"Reviewed in the United States March 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have used this controller for 10-20 hours a month on weekends. It has not been dropped or abused in any way.When I open the joystick reconfigurer in the Xbox>Settings>Accessories menu, it indicates the input it's receiving from the joystick. My left joystick is constantly moving forward. When I swirl the joystick it doesn't track the movement of the joystick accurately. It bumps up and down in a circle and can only hit the outside of the joystick perimeter in the corners of the circle. It cannot hit the top, bottom, left or right.From what I'm reading online, it's looking like I'm pretty much SOL because the warranty does not last longer than 90 days. The worst part is bought this controller because my Elite 1 was malfunctioning and wouldn't stop pressing up on the D-Pad.After this I will never be getting an Elite controller again. Scuff or 3rd party will (unfortunately) be the replacement for this as well as the one I will be getting my wife.I would NOT recommend getting this controller without some sort of extended warranty. Everything I've read on forums and support boards say the same thing.

Who wants to keep a 170$ piece of hardware that doesn't work. However, both Amazon and Microsoft support absolutely refused to help me with anything. Even a partial refund was not an option. Funnily enough, one of the many customer service agents offered me a 10% return ($17), however, it was immediately refused again once I mentioned the sexual orientation of my soulmate.I am beyond disappointed in both Microsoft and Amazon for NOT even trying to give me a good solution for paying this much of a controller.

    Poor Contacts and Construction
  
",2.0,Anthony,"Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  I cannot recommend this controller.TLDR: I love the paddles, I love the weight, I love the D-pad, and I love the overall customization. However the button contacts are unreliable and often do not register with quick light presses. I think the overall construction of these controllers is mediocre at best, I had one of the trigger sensitivity switches fall off despite the fact I do not use them. A great idea poorly executed, certainly not worth the price tagAfter about a month of owning it, I noticed the ""A"" button did not fully make contact. If I pressed it with the outside of my thumb, the button press would not register. Not a huge deal but I did order a replacement just to be sure.My replacement had the same issue. I decided to map one of the paddles to ""A"" instead.About 6 months in the RB button became unresponsive. Using the Xbox accessories app I could see that the button press would disengage depending on how much force I pressed the button (the LB would stay engaged no matter how little force). Having passed my return date I opened the controller up and tried to fix it myself. Any fix I implemented only lasted a few days.The final straw was today the soft plastic cover of one of the trigger switches fell off and now I have just a sharp switch on the back of my controller. It doesn't look to have broken, and it slips back on, so I figure the adhesive wore off. I haven't even had this controller a year.I work in IT, I handle my tech with care, so I haven't chucked it across the room or anything. This Elite controller has been a saga of disappointment. I really like a lot of the features it offers, but it's a heavy gamble that the entire controller will work for an ""extended"" time. And for the price of almost 3x a standard controller? It's just not worth it

  This is a great co troller however mine has a huge issue, it shocks you! After a while I noticed a numbing pain when using the paddles.  I thought this might be my hand developing issues but turns out the controller was shocking me!  I contacted Microsoft as this was obviously a hardware issue but it was over the 90 day warranty so they cannot offer a replacement and do not offer repairs.My suggestion to anyone thinking about buying this controller should get an extended warranty or buy a custom controller from another brand with an extended warranty.  Otherwise plug your controller in and test if it shocks you when it arrives so you can ensure you did not receive a faulty controller.

  I just opened my controller, and out of the box, the A button does not respond properly. Everything else, however, is absolutely perfect. It feels better than the original elite controller, it seems better built, and overall is just better in concept. The only thing keeping me from giving it a 5 star review is the issue with the A button. I have a replacement coming from Amazon, and I have noted the issue with the return request. I will update this, probably with 5 stars, if I get a perfect replacement without any issues, because this is truly a quality controller. If the next one has the same issue, I'm going through Microsoft warranty to see what the deal is, and if the controller can be fixed. If I get it returned from them unfixed, this controller will, unfortunately, end up with a 1 star from me. Right now, it's a waiting game. I will know whether it's great or not on Tuesday.Update: I am on my third controller now. I have a 100% rate of unresponsive buttons with every controller I've gotten. On replacement from Amazon and one straight from Microsoft. Do not waste your money on this product. I thought that, after a year, Microsoft would've fixed the issues they acknowledged with this controller, but they have not. They are just ripping you off. They are selling a product that they know is defective.

  I was scared and skeptical about this controller but the fixed everything that was wrong the the original and the stuff that just needed to be tweaked a bit. This is a great controller and would tell everyone and anyone that is worth it, any real gamer will go through regular controllers like water because they are cheaply made of all plastic. No lie I used to have to buy a new controller every 1-2 months because the toggles would get damaged so bad from rubbing plastic on plastic, the only controller this didn’t happen with is the day one controller that came with the system. They didn’t use the same grade of cheap plastic that they use now on the regular controllers somehow it was sturdy and lasted until the internal components gave out. In my opinion yes it is expensive but if you don’t have to buy another controller for at least a year doesn’t that save you a lot of money, not to mention the great quality of the controller! I say this is worth buying no matter what type of player you are!

  I’ll preface this by saying I’ve used scuff before and have a bit of comparison. For the money, you’re not getting a better pro controller. I used the Elite now 3 months and it has made a world of difference. I exclusively play COD: Warzone and it has enhanced my game experience tremendously. Firstly, the controller looks and feels high quality. Rubberized grips, metallic paddles and high quality plastic perforated triggers. Secondly, the level of customization is god tier. Changing out the joy sticks for different sizes, adding and eliminating back paddles, quick setting your trigger distance, Xbox software to lower your vibrations and easily program the back paddles, increasing the tension on the joysticks. ALL SUPER EASY AND QUICK. They literally give you the tools to do it. Listen, I play A LOT of COD and I’ve used scuf before. This is far far superior and so much easier to customize for such a reasonable price. If you can afford a Battle Beaver, go for it. But for the price, you’re not getting a better pro controller. My game has changed so much that I can rep this controller enough. My only gripe is that Sony can’t friggin do the same!!!

  Purchased for use with my windows 10 pc and replaced my old series 1 xbox elite controller.Out of the box I greatly enjoyed the ability to change the tension on the control sticks, really changes the feel of the controller, hated how ""floaty"" the old one felt.However, one glaring flaw is how frequent the controller disconnects randomly, even with a full charge. The controller will simply drop for 5 seconds until it can reconnect, which is simply unacceptable with an over $200 entry fee. I updated the control firmware as well as updated windows 10 in the hopes for a fix.

  So I bought this controller because my friends have the series 1 and love it and it had a year warranty. So I bought this controller after going through a bunch of the $60.00 Controllers because the thumb sticks kept drifting.Got the controller worked great, felt great everything was good. Well a couple months later the sticks was drifting a little bit not bad and adjusted it in the controller settings then after 3 months the Left thumb stick is mostly non responsive and the buttons are sticking, plus the short throw slider switch fell apart but easily fixed. Of course now the controller is out of warranty after 90 days and is $100.00 to repair/replace while Microsoft is still deciding it policy on these controllers. Definitely not worth the money for a controller that I would not consider for professional gamers when a hobbyist is having issues with it with minimal use. Not to mention when contacted customer service Microsoft is still figuring out how to deal with all the repair requests and complaints about the warranty so basically stuck in limbo till they figure it out.

  I got this on Halloween and I must say this is the best Xbox Controller I've had. From the way it feels to the additional parts, this is easily the best controller on the market. What kills it is the lack of durability. Anyone who has done research on this controller knows about the numerous occasions of this controller arriving broken on their doorstep. In my case, I had stick drift in both sticks and the A button was sucked. Surprisingly, the A button stopped being stuck after further use, however the Left Thumbstick is practically broken for me after 2 and a half months of using it. I can't do a full rotation without feeling some sort of hitch with the stick. Thankfully, Microsoft extended the warranty on this for a whole year now and I was able to get a replacement. My final verdict, is that you should be cautious about ordering this controller since it's almost $200 here. If you do want an advanced controller, this is easily the best one out there, but beware of durability issues and make sure you register the controller on Xbox.com.

If youre in the market for a controller with mappable buttons on the back, go with the 40 dollar fusion a rgb one. It's 40 bucks and the buttons feel better.

From the viewpoint of an average guy, this controller is very much worth it.I play about six hours a week.  Given that, the cost per day becomes economical.  My first elite worked seamlessly for almost two years (and is was working when I retired it) and I expect similar performance from this controller.

  Microsoft is the worst company I have ever done business with. My son received an Xbox series 2 Elite Controller for Christmas 2019. Microsoft provided a 90 day warranty for it. The controller stopped working in March but, since we reside in the New Rochelle containment zone, we were more concerned with the global pandemic of COVID than with the controller. When we contacted Microsoft, they have absolutely no interest in helping up. They do not care that the world shut down for COVID and they will not stand behind their product which stopped functioning within the 90 warranty period, again, DURING, a worldwide pandemic. They are charging me $110 to have the controller repaired and they will only guarantee the controller will work for 30 days after the repair. The original price for the controller was $180. DO NOT BUY THIS CONTROLLER! DO NOT BUY MICROSOFT PRODUCTS! They will not stand behind their products.

  The Elite 1 sticks does not work on the Elite 2; is a big deal because the stick selection is not duplicated from the Elite 1.  Elite 1 paddles work on the Elite 2 which I prefer over the smaller paddles provided with the Elite 2.  The stiffer joystick settings are not desirable to me so I'm using the Elite 1 setting.  The biggest deal breaker is the converters to use it on a PS4 does not work.

    Tried Two; Both Defective
  
",1.0,JLF,"Reviewed in the United States March 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  This controller was for my teenage son.  The number three paddle (P3) did not work on the first one and we sent it back and got a refund.  About a month later my son wanted to try again, thinking maybe a second controller would work.  He really wanted this controller, but he wanted one that would work.  On the second controller the face buttons (a, b, x, y) did not work (maybe sometimes if you press them just the right way), so we sent it back and got a refund.  That is two defective controllers in a row.  If this controller worked, my son would give it five stars.  Since none of them worked, even one star is too high a rating.  If you get one of these, pay attention to the 30 day time period you have to send it back.  Test it well and make sure it is working correctly as you approach the end of the 30 day return window or you could be stuck with a $180 piece of junk.

",1.0,Thomas Simons,"Reviewed in the United States October 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  I've owned this for 2 months now and the left thumbstick is already faulty. I get drift (inputs registered when the stick is in the resting position) and inputs from the stick are sometimes not registered at all when in the max position. There's a current class action lawsuit about this issue affecting every single xbox one controller, and support is swamped so I will have to deal with this for quite some time before it gets fixed. The warranty from MS is only 4 months, which is insane for how much this costs. It should be a full 1 year at the very least. If by December the issue is not fixed, I will have to solder on a 3rd party thumbstick myself.If you want to game competitively, do not buy this controller until the drift issue is fixed.Aside from that, the controller feels great in my hands and the level of customization is awesome. I still use this over a playstation controller, because the PS controller is just so awkward to use imo.

  Unfortunately, trying to get it to pair to anything or stay paired is nearly impossible. First off you have to use the Xbox Accessories application to do ANYTHING which can only be installed via the MS store which requires you to be on specific versions of Windows. If you've debloated your Windows install, this is incredibly frustrating. Once you DO go through all the hassle of getting Windows updated to the specific version it wants and the MS Store working and downloading the app to update the firmware of the controller you might be able to start using it. Sometimes the controller just decides it doesn't want to advertise though. My PC can see and connect to other Bluetooth peripherals but multiple PCs cant see the Xbox controller for no discernible reason.

  Ordered this yesterday hoping it'd be a solid way to save some money on this controller, but overall was disappointed.The outer packaging was in great shape, but the controller itself was dirty and clearly uncleaned before being shipped back out. Had to spend a few minutes wiping it down and cleaning someone else's hand dirt out from the cracks before I could get to actually using it.When I plugged it in to the console, the previous owner's control profile was still active on the controller, and I realized the paddles were still attached, with one of the paddles not functioning properly.Long story short, while the Amazon Warehouse Refurbished/Renewed option is presented as a product that has been fixed or tended to, it appears to me as though in this case the item was simply a reboxed and reshipped return that never actually saw any sort of refurbishment whatsoever.Yes, you get a discount buying it this way, but no, it's not really ever acceptable to receive a product that looks as though it could have been pulled from the storage bins at a goodwill and that hasn't been refurbished when it's billed as so.EDIT: After initially posting this realized I did not receive a Series 2 at all, but a Series 1 in a series 2 box. So clearly what happened here was someone originally bought the Series 2, and returned their Series 1 with it, and rather than refurbish the product or even verify it was the product, Amazon just repackaged and sold it as a series 2. Unbelievable.

  Aye, just straight up, don't waste your time buying this controller. It's not worth it.I had the controller for about 6 month, and during that time, it was awesome. Loved playing with it, however, my LB button suddenly just went out one day. I treat my controllers very well, and I don't do anything out of the ordinary with them. I noticed the issue when I was trying to switch inventory items in Minecraft. Thought it was just a weird thing with the game, even checked the control bindings. Found if I mashed it super hard, it would register the press. Then I went to play Rocket League where I very often use LB for air rolling while doing aerials and drifting on the ground. Found it wasn't registering my button presses there. Sent it in for repairs, got it back 2 weeks later where Microsoft straight up sent me a new controller. Not bad, figured if it came straight from Microsoft, should have no issues. I'm writing this after having the new controller for 2 days. I'm playing Rocket League again and this time the B button doesn't register all the time. I compared it with my brand new Series X controller I got since I was out of my Elite controller for 2 weeks while it was out and the Series X controller registers B every time I press it. Don't water your time, it's not worth the hassles you're going to have with it.

  I ended up buying this back in January 2020 and right out of the box the left joystick was sticking and drifting. I sent it back in exchange for a new one. For the first few months the replacement worked fine. Then the little caps that cover the switches for the adjustability on the triggers fell off just leaving the little nubs where you have to flip the controller and pinch them to adjust the triggers. I didn't really care about that since I never used that feature. About May hits and the buttons feel like they are starting to stick an takes a little more of a firm press to use. At first I thought it was dirty but I always put it back and close the case when I'm not using it and wipe it down somewhat regularly. Starting around August the right bumper decided to stop working (I never dropped the controller or banged it on a table). It started where I got to FIRMLY press it to use it and even then majority of the time it still doesn't work. Recently on one of the last few days in September the right bumper just stopped working completely and I even started using this controller less going back the the basic one that came with my One X. When the Xbox One was initially released I bought the Elite bundle which came with the first elite controller and the entire time I had it and used it i had no issues. That is even with the occasional drop some being a little hard when the cord for my headset gets cought on the arm of my chair. I ended up selling it to a friend for really cheap and he still has no issues with it. On the plus side I've had no issues with Bluetooth connectivity which it sounds like is another issue these tend to have. Long story short for $180 it is not work it and your better of buying the 1st elite controller.

My accuracy and reaction times have increased dramatically simply because of switching to the Series 2.If you get sent a problematic controller then just send it back and get a new one. Repeat if necessary. The controller is well worth the hassle if you don’t get a perfect one right away. Stop being hesitant in buying one like I was.

Movement and menu selecting is terrible when doing anything on the console, the controller, quite literally, plays itself. Amazon will direct you to Microsoft, Microsoft will direct you to Xbox, and Xbox has fully anticipated these kinds of problems for their shitty controller and will not allow you to call or chat with human being about their controller issues— you get stuck with a ""virtual"" agent which tells you nothing is possible because you're device has no warranty and you must buy a replacement. Thus the circle of hell repeats. For $180 this is a terrible product. Be prepared to constantly pay for a warranty, and be prepared to replace this controller every six months because what is quality control compared to lining their pockets?

  This controller is amazing when it works. It feels much better than the standard controllers. The hair triggers make a big difference in shooting games and I like how easy it is to turn on them on and off. The ability to quickly set it up for different games with the additional paddles and sticks is just what I was looking for. I couldn't be happier. BUT within the first week the A button was sticking repeatedly just as seen in videos by other reviewers. I tried cleaning it out with a Q-tip and rubbing alcohol like Microsoft recommends, but it didn't change a thing. I don't think a company like Microsoft should expect a consumer to have to troubleshoot manufacturing issues right out of the box on a controller that cost 3 times that of a regular one. This controller is being returned until the manufacturing defects which appear to run rampant are fixed. 5 stars to Amazons return policy.

  I honestly can't say anything actually bad about this controller. It has tons of great features, it has plenty of options for various games, and it is very customizable and versatile. The only gripe I have is that with the way your left hand rests on the left grip with your thumb on the left joystick makes it a tiny bit awkward to press in the paddles, but I'm chalking that up to my very large hands and not the controller. A lot of people whine about the fact that there's some play in the joysticks but it isn't noticeable at all during gameplay and I can't imagine it actually affecting someone as there really isn't that much play at all. The battery life and charger are great, it was one of the sellibg points for me, and the case is really nice too. I don't feel conflicted saying that this is the best controller for any gaming system. It's highly presice, of excellent quality, and extremely practical.

  B button is stuck after 3 months of light use.. been very mindful of clean hands, no spills, no drops.Everything about the feel, the look, the heft is great otherwise.I tried contacting microsoft about repair, opposed to opening this up and voiding warranty.. however, it was 1 day after the 90 and denied by the automated system.Attached a picture for fun.Will have to push them with a phone call as it appears they extended the warranty out to 1 year.. will have to see if it's honored.

  It worked great for a month, then it started drifting ( the left thumbstick) I contacted Microsoft but they blew me off telling me to get the app and adjust the thumb triggers.  This worked for a month and it started again.  I know it is hardware issue since it happens on both Xboxes and my pc.  I called them again and since it has now been past 90 days they won't even talk to me.FFS

  I was skeptical about getting a new controller, much less an xbox controller. I can tell you, this was a great purchase! I love the way the controller feels, and being a big guy, the controller fits in my hands pretty great! The customization of the joysticks, the different magnetic pop ins, the hardware the controller is built with, it was well worth the money! Recommend for sure if youre looking for a controller that will last you a long time on PC.I thought the bluetooth was fucky at first, but I had to install my pc's network antenna, and it boosted the bluetooth signal, and now the wireless works like a charm! So amazing!

",2.0,Carlos,"Reviewed in the United States November 6, 2020","









  
  
    
  Seven months after purchasing this brand new product I already have issues with one of the back paddle buttons not clicking when applied pressure triggering my OCD ..also the switch on the back, the one that adjusts the pull of the triggers, has a plastic piece that keeps coming off . Should’ve just saved my money honestly because hypothetically speaking if none of that happened and everything worked perfectly, my big hands had to adjust to the way the back paddles were placed causing a joint in my middle finger to start swelling after playing, when I would touch this swollen bump, it would create some numbness so I just stopped using the back paddles altogether then came back to play with the paddles after I healed to realize I don’t have a proper “clicking” on one of the back paddle I use for “A” which I mentioned earlier.. with the amount I paid, it should’ve been durable product that actually fits my hands.

  I’ve been using this for about 2 months now and what a difference! My original elite controller was starting to break down, which is under stable after so many hours and years with it. I decided to use it with my second setup in our office and buy a new Elite for the main room. This version improves on the original with awesome grips, a sleek look, no external batteries and more! Great purchase.Now is it justifiable considering you can get a new system almost at this price? That’s up to you. I love mine though, highly recommended.

  I bought this controller just a few months ago. Almost Two HUNDRED dollars. I owned it for a little over a month and I had problems with sticks drifting. Made every game almost unplayable. Can't scroll any menus, can't do anything. This controller was a HUGE waste of money and because it was past the time of return I can't return it. I'm only writing this review now because all my other controllers are getting really old and no longer functioning well. Those aren't a big deal, they're cheap. 60$ basic controller. But you'd THINK that maybe a 200$ controller would last a little longer than a MONTH before breaking. Just awesome.

    Substantial Thumbstick Drift Within Months of Use
  
",3.0,Alex,"Reviewed in the United States June 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  I had the Elite Series 1 for almost five years, before mine crapped out, so I had high hopes for this controller. I used this controller daily for about four months, and within that time, I had issues with stick drift, especially on the left one. As I play a lot of FPS games, my player would either move with no input, or would not move in certain directions even with the stick input at max. I tried all sorts of in-game settings (like stick deadzones) and custom configurations within the app (response curves), but nothing really helped. I'm sure I'm probably in the minority for issues with this controller, but your mileage will most certainly vary. The issues that I experienced were unacceptable for a controller that costs almost as much as a console, and they cropped up outside of the 45-day warranty for the controller, so I would have paid almost as much in shipping, handling, and repairs as I would have for a new controller.My advice: save your money, and either by a Strike Pack for a standard controller, or go with the PowerA Fusion, if you don't playing with wired-only controllers. I got the latter a few months back. While the controller isn't as premium regarding build, customization, and software, you get paddles and on-the-fly remapping for less than half the price ($80), and I like the way the analog sticks feel more than the Elite Series 2. Or, save your money for the next-gen Series X.

  I have had this for a while, and shame on me for not returning when I could. My model came with a malfunctioning bumper, its double and some times triple clicks the right bumper when a single, even quick press. It is more disappointing than anything even at this point some 6 months or so later. However it works, for the most part.

  I have bought 2 of these controllers and both have developed connectivity issues over time.  The most recent one started just a few weeks after light use.  Microsoft doesn't seem interested in honoring the extended warranty that they issued for this product, which is your first indicator that I didn't receive a lemon, but there is an issue with the entire product line (or at least a high failure rate).  I would not recommend buying this product because most issues seem to appear outside the return window of Amazon, at which point you will be at the mercy of Microsoft's return/replacement policy - good luck with that.

  So there are plenty of people having issues with their Elite Series 2s. I’m not going to discount their claims but I will say that I have yet to have issues with mine in particular. The feel in your hand is amazing, the weight just feels right, and the functionality is amazing. I am still getting use to the paddles, so I do occasionally grip the controller too hard and hit one of the paddles, but that’s a user error. I highly recommend going for this controller. If you don’t like it, you can return it, and if it has issues outside of those 30 days you still have the warranty.

  I was super excited for a while now since version 2 was announced. This was an item that I didn't even consider researching due to me loving the first one.  At first sight you can see the improvements and even in the way it felt holding it. The extra customizability for the hair triggers, the analog stick resistance, and the built in battery. Well it doesn't mean anything if its supposed to do this and be wireless, constant disconnections and if I don't feel like dancing around trying to get it to work I just plug it in. Not only that, the stick randomly suffers from drifting. Well I regret buying this and now I use it as a wired controller as soooo many people have complained and nothing has happened.

  First review ever and own two original elite controllers both are great controllers except for the series 2.  I purchased it in May 31,2020 and for a month now the left thumb stick has a drift going up.  I paid a premium on it for 250.00 and now the controller is out of warranty only 90 days which is un called for it should be at least 6 months considering I play on occasion and not 12 hours a day.  Basically you can get a replacement for 90.00 plus dollars with no guarantee it will not happen again and I hear the replacements can be just as bad or worse then you sent back.  I can't even imagine the amount of money they are making on gig , basically you can be spending 180.00 + 90 + 90 = 360.00 a year on a controller this is just hypothetical or at least 90.00 plus a year for replacements.  I know Microsoft knows there is/was an issue with this but didn't offer anyone of us an extended warranty for this.  Very sad in deed...

  I have owned 2 different generation 1 elite controllers and had issues with both. The first has a loose right stick, which I had replaced under warranty with a brand new controller. Approximately two years later the bumper broke and the left stick became loose.The gen 2 elite controller feels much more solid, and they have redesigned the bumpers and sticks. I love the ability to adjust tension in the sticks, especially for shooters. I also like the smaller paddles, because I can set the controller down and they won’t activate.My only fear is the internal battery eventually becoming weak over time. So far I have been careful to only charge the controller when the battery gives me a warning. So far the battery has lasted 16+ hours on a single charge. I recommend this controller for anyone who wants to have a little more advantage in games and who enjoys tweaking the hardware to personalize your gaming experience.

  Out of the box this controller felt sturdy and looked awesome.

Warranty process was easy and I received my replacement only to have it do the same thing but with added issues in its response to the furthermost up and down directions in less than a month. I loved the first Elite controller and have used it for over three years with the only failure being the bumpers broke, which I fixed pretty easily.

  I first received a controller where LT did not function at all. I returned that one and received another promptly in the mail. The first month was fine, enough time to expire the warranty, but just after about a month of regular use the left joystick started to drift. If you don’t know what stick drift is, after holding a direction on the joystick for a while when you let it go it gets stuck a little off center and the stick starts to drift in that direction. I did some research and found that a lot of people have this problem with the controller because of one cheap plastic part on the inside. I primarily use this controller for shooters, and the stick drifting is very distracting to my aim. The paddles are great but I recommend finding another brand of controller with paddles. A problem as simple as this should not occur in a controller worth more than $150.

  The bests controller I’ve ever had, does exactly what is advertised. And that said there’s also things that are wrong with this, the first elite controller to me had more grip to the grips than this one, and I’ve had 2 so far since I got them when they came out. The first one had RB double clicks so I had to try and exchange it at Walmart where I bought it, since corona happened there was none in stock so they lady already took the controller wherever damages go, so I had to order here on Amazon in May, thankfully they came back in stock soon enough and only took a week and a half to send in. It worked perfectly up until somehow the inside of the right trigger the padding fell off which has never happened to me before in any controller. Every time I shot a gun in call of duty it would stick so good luck using semi auto guns, but I did find a trick to make the padding not be sticky and that’s to go into the app and make it forcefully vibrate until it falls off so now it’s just a clacking sound and works fine I just hate how it has to happen to such a good controller. I have never dropped it, always keep my controllers safe and dust free. Anyways I hope this helps you with your purchase.

",1.0,Andy,"Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  I'll never buy an Xbox product again after my experience with this controller.  Right thumbstick stopped working 45 days after the pathetic 90 day warranty.  The controller is lightly used and never dropped or spilled on.  It's a hardware issue that was not caused by me, and I'm not the only one with these problems - see the class action lawsuit.  Microsoft refuses to replace unless I pay 100$ on top of the 180$ I already spent.  Unbelievable.  DO NOT BUY THIS UNLESS YOU BUY AN EXTENDED WARRANTY!!

    Avoid, build quality is sub-par and warranty is a sham.
  
",1.0,James,"Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  TLDR: Avoid, stick with Elite Series 1.This controller is absolute trash. Five months after purchase the right bumper works only half the time and half of that time it double presses the button, face buttons (X,Y,A,B buttons) fail to register button presses. Sticks show signs of drift. Grips are uncomfortable when using the rear paddles causing cramps in my hands after an hour or two. None of these problems existed with the Elite Series 1, though it had its own set of issues those pale by comparison in my opinion.For $180.00, more should be expected for build quality. How Microsoft can pass this off as a professional accessory is beyond me, let alone calling it an upgrade from the Elite Series 1.Warranty is only 5 months it seems then Microsoft will not repair the controller, which coincidentally is about how long it will take for the issues I described above to show up with a moderate amount of use. 2 - 3 hours daily use.

   Don't bother spending the money on the elite v2, will break in less than a year just like the standard controller. Microsoft could easily spend the extra 50 cents a controller to get better quality potentiometer (joystick) boxes, on what is supposed to be a premium product. As far as i can tell it is the same crap that is on the regular controller (both of mine did the same thing).I'm an engineer in a consumer appliance industry and it is joke to think these controllers are passing any type of stress/life testing. It is painfully obvious that these have a planned life cycle of 1 year or less. Part of the Microsoft plan to keep you spending. I hear PS4 controllers hold up a bit better, going to make the switch

",1.0,Brian,"Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  The A and Y buttons are inconsistent to me.  It's not that they're sticky, it's that you can get an audible click sound without the button activating if you don't hit it dead on in the middle.  You have to press it straight on to get it to register.I ordered a replacement and the second one has the same exact issue in the same exact way.  For a 180 dollar controller you'd think they get the jump button working consistently.  It's a shame too, because the sticks feel really good, but I'm not going to take a third chance on what seems more likely to be a design defect than a Q/A failure.

  Honestly I was really excited to get my first elite controller, but this thing has been nothing but a disappointment. Straight out of the box it seemed fine, it was really cool to see all of the extra buttons and paddles and stuff but after a day or two of playing the buttons started sticking and the right trigger gets stuck sometimes. For how much I paid for this thing I’m honestly really irritated that my 2 year old xbox controller is working better than this, and keep in mind I wash my hands before touching the elite and I never eat or anything when I’m using it. Very disappointed with this purchase.

  Bought mine here because there was a good deal on it, but when I received it I noticed one of the back right paddles wasn't catching on the part inside the controller that holds it in place and allows the paddle to press the actual button. Having a Microsoft Store near me, I took it in the very next day and explained the situation and they immediately swapped it out and offered a 2 year warranty for $20 (which I took).The controller is great. It feels good to hold, press buttons, trigger stops work appropriately, software to remap is easy to use. But for all of the controllers that show up broken in some way, hopefully you're able to do what I did with mine.

  I ignored the other reviews, played the odds, and lost.When it works, the product is fantastic. Good weight. Felt solid. Customizable. It was a joy to use. But it lasted 2 months. Fortunately, mine died within the warranty, so I get a replacement - other weren't so lucky.I wouldn't chance it. There is no excuse for a nearly $200 controller to routinely break so quickly. Honestly, I only really wanted the back paddles. Maybe the right play was to get set that clipped onto my old controller. Too late now.Update: I just got my replacement controller. After about 5 hours of use my A button is sticking a bit (I hardly use this button - mapped the back paddle to be A).

    Amazing controller, button issues
  
",4.0,Matt Szewczyk,"Reviewed in the United States March 11, 2020","









  
  
    
  Holding this controller feels great! The quality and weight just feel expensive. Mapping the buttons is easy to do with the accessories app on Xbox/PC. I think this controller is well worth the money...except for one major problem. The face butttons(A, B, X, Y), particularly the A Button, have a hardware issue that causes the button to work intermittently. Sometimes the button doesn't register a press if pressed lightly or off-center. This is particularly noticeable in platformers and fighting games, where precision button presses are key. You can map the affected button to a different button or the paddles on the back and it works just fine. Microsoft is aware of this issue, it's pretty well known as of now, hopefully they'll have a resolution soon. As of today, 3/11/20, I received my first replacement and the A Button is having the exact same issue. I'll be returning this one for another replacement soon. It still gets 4 stars because everything else about this controller, EVERYTHING ELSE, is perfect!

    Right bumper (RB) not responding!
  
",2.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States May 27, 2020","









  
  
    
  Bought one this controller a few of months ago. Initially everything worked as you might expect from a $180 controller. After 4 weeks the RB button started to not respond when pressed. Despite hearing the resounding click when pressed it was not responding unless applying an extra amount of pressure. I called Microsoft, explained issure and sent controller in and they sent back a new one.Once again everything worked great. Right after about 1 month again, I noticed the RB button wouldn't respond just as the previous controller. With the standard controllers I have never had this problem. Typically I'll use a controller for 2 years before replacing it (usually still issue free). I typically wouldn't be so critical on this problem, but if you are gonna sell a ""superior"" controller for 3 times the price of a standard one, it better be dang near flawless for at least a year of use. Kinda just frustrating now that I have adjusted to the back paddles and almost never use the A,B,X,Y buttons any more. I really don't care for doing the calling in and explaining what is wrong and sending it in and waiting for them to send a new one back. Likely to only have the same problem a month later. The controller isn't put through any abuse, (i.e falls, throwing, eating and then playing) so there is no reason to have this issue. Maybe I really just got two duds, and the 3rd one will be perfect. Have to wait and see.

(a HUGE USB receiver for 20 plus dollars with bad connection is stupid) Complaints with my Gen 1 elite controller is the missing build-in Bluetooth feature and the controller size is little big for my hand.

    Amazing upgrade from standard and scuf plastic controllers
  
",5.0,Colton Reed,"Reviewed in the United States August 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  As soon as you pull this out of the box it is clear that it was made with quality in mind. It is heavy, with durable metal parts.I purchased my custom scuf controller in 2015 and it finally died after countless hours of gaming with the thumbstick practically melting off. I thought this would be an acceptable replacement and I was absolutely correct. I can immediately tell the quality difference and the better customization is nice to have. The controller does feel slightly smaller than my last, but it could also be because of a different in controller generations and paddle design. Going from pure plastic to a nice rubber grip is jarring and amazing.Having the Bluetooth functionality is nice(old controller generation did not have this) and being able to play on PC, Xbox, and mobile are all pluses.So far, so good, but only time can tell! I hope this will last at least as long as my previous controller, and from the first few months with it, I think this will be the case.

  I never got an original elite due to all the complaints, but decided to splurge on a series 2 right when it came out, have had absolutely no issues with mine so far, but it seems a common issue that the shortest trigger pull setting just flat out doesnt work (it may have been fixed in more recent makes of them, but I never intended to use it so I haven't chacked). The grip seems to stay on better than the series 1, although mine doesn't go through any sweaty games. Feels great, nice weight to it. If you dont have the issue if destroying controllers it's probably a good purchase.

  After the windows app recognized the controller I thought configuring the unit would be a snap, but the configure button was disabled. Multiple attempts to contact Microsoft failed to resolve the issue so we exchanged it for another unit, which had the same issue.

So I’m back to my Scuff controller again until the next great controller for the PC arrives.

Really the best controller I’ve ever used (coming from DS4).If I were to mention one CON on the controller its the common problem with the blutooth connection, if you try to connect this controller while you already have other blut devices connected to your PC it wont work no matter what you do.

    Standard vs. Elite1 ....Elite1 vs. Elite2....
  
",5.0,shamalamadingdong,"Reviewed in the United States December 4, 2019","









  
  
    
  When I first tried the elite 1 controller I noticed little difference between that and a standard. After a long period of using the elite 1, I accidentally grabbed a standard controller.  I could not believe the difference between the two. The elite 1 was far superior in every way and I could never go back to a standard remote. Flash forward to the elite 2... At first I noticed little difference between that and the elite 1. Then after about two weeks of using the 2, I picked up the 1 and tried playing with it. The result was the same as the standard vs 1. The 2 feels far superior to the 1 and I will not go back. The programming aspect of the controllers doesn't interest me much and the paddles are not my thing so I have no comment on them. The adjustable tension control sticks and the faster hair trigger really stand out to me and are more responsive. Is it worth the money? I think so, but ultimate you will have to decide for yourself.  Highly recommended.

  I want to preface this saying that I've always been a fan of the Xbox controller design. The design and layout of the Xbox controller has always felt more comfortable and natural compared to the other consoles for me.Now for the Elite Series 2 controller itself. Everything was great up until a few months of use, where the Right Bumper (RB) became unresponsive. After searching up the issue, I've come across numerous posts on the Microsoft Support forums, all having the same common issue. What is most alarming is how common this issue was, and that the only official responses from Microsoft I have seen is ""please contact our support.""For a device with a premium price tag, this is unacceptable. What's more, the fixes I've seen all involve having to open the controller faceplate, which is secured with adhesives along the plastic, rather than screws, which actively obstructs the owner's ability to perform minor repairs and maintenance.

  I've had this controller a little over a month and it has been great! However this is the second I've purchased, the first got stick drift about a month and a half to two months after I bought it. No signs of that happening with this one yet. However that should tell you something in itself. Even after buying one and having it go bad and dealing with losing money returning it to Amazon because it was after the return policy was up I still bought another. For me there's no going back to a regular controller after using it. I have a first gen elite controller and it has never given me any problems in the 4 yearsish since I bought it. But going back to that after using the series 2 want cutting it.In short it is very worth it, but either buy an extended warranty, or go to the Microsoft site and register out there for a warranty. Not saying it will break but it seems to be a known issue so might add well cover yourself.

  Overall it is fine. Good battery solid inputs feels good. However after having it for only 3 months I have started to experience ghost input and drift in the left thumb stick. I play on PC and usually use M+K for most games so the controller doesn't get that much use and overall probably has less than 60 hours of total use which is honestly far to little to be having these sorts of quality issues from normal wear and tear. The default software for remapping buttons is also complete trash and only allows a one to one replacement of button function which means no macros and no input options that aren't already one of the default buttons. Luckily there are some 3rd party applications that can fix that and give options for macros and other inputs such as mouse and keyboard buttons.

Its a shame because I love the way the elite series 2 controller feels, but these constant defective issues with the buttons are just horrific for such a high priced product. I firmly Believe amazon isnt curating their 3rd party merchants at all and allowing them to just keep reselling the same broken controllers over and over.I bought a ""NEW"" Controller yet all 3 times the controller I received was clearly used yet i payed full price for it. Will be returning for the 3rd time.This is unacceptable for a controller that costs as much as a Nintendo switch almost. I feel like Microsoft made way too many of these and refuses to do a recall despite knowing that many of them are severely defective. I know many other fps players that also have the same issues with this controller. Amazon 3rd party sellers are simply selling the same busted controllers to anyone that buys one and its so sad that Amazon does nothing about this.

  Should've done my research, or at least read other reviews. Haven't had the controller for more than a month, and it's already suffering from severe stick drift in the left analog stick. Been playing Xbox exclusively for the better part of a decade, so I've always taken care of my controllers. So I was shocked initially when it happened mid game, and assumed maybe I screwed up but then I started googling things/reading reddit threads and reviews. After asking other friends with elites what their experiences were, I regret making this purchase. Which is sad because for about 2 weeks I loved it, and felt like I had more control in game than ever before with the customization features. Week 3 I noticed it, and from there it just got progressively worse. Nothing to do but college assignments and game in quarantine, and now I don't play all together because the controller makes it seriously annoying now.

    Defective Left Bumper
  
",1.0,theitalianriviera,"Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  I wish I could go back in time and never have bought this controller. After having the Xbox elite controller for 4 years, a part of the rubber grip was coming off and I decided why not buy the new elite 2 series controller. I thought it would be better, and well I thought wrong. After using it for two months, the left bumper would have to be pressed two or three times firmly until it would work. I returned it, got a replacement. Two months later, the same problem happened again with the left bumper not working. I ended up fixing the rubber grip on my xbox elite controller and started using that again. I feel like a jerk returning this for a second time, so I'm stuck with an overpriced extra controller thats only capable of working to navigate Netflix. The elite 2 series controller is a TOTAL SCAM!

  Man what a shame. The overall feel and design of this controller is absolutely top-notch. Arguably perfect. It FEELS like a $200 piece of hardware BUT...The buttons only register 70-80% of the time. The most frequent offender being the A button.Folks, that's like spending $100K on a new car only to have the gas pedal work ""most of the time"".This is a problem that would be unacceptable on even a $10 controller. If the controller is unable to control... it is 100% a failed product.DO NOT BUY until Microsoft officially recalls and updates this design. It just isn't worth the risk of failure I experienced, and later realized half of the internet had already complained about.

  Awesome controller and way better than the standard controller... BUT I give it 3 stars because my 1st controller seemed used, but after exchanging it, it was great. 2nd reason is the paddles didn't seem to register unless I pressed VERY hard in witch makes it difficult to use. BUT if this happens to you, don’t worry, use some tape to make the paddle switch a little more accessible and you will be fine. I used a little dab of hot glue which made the paddle very sensitive. The fact that this controller is rechargeable and has a magnetic charging base makes it worth it.

    Stick Drift After 6 Months, No Refunds
  
",1.0,Jordan S.,"Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  When I first got this controller, I would have rated it a 5. However as a burned owner of a series 1 I wanted to give people an honest long term opinion of the revision. Its my fault for giving them another chance but hopefully someone can read this and not waste their money. Series 1 grips fell apart, and this one is much improved. However within 6 months of medium use (I play for a couple hours 3-4 days out of the week) the left stick drifts so badly I cant make character selections or aim during gameplay. Called microsoft, they told me there was only a 90 day warranty and there was nothing they could do besides charge me $99 to send a replacement. Why would I pay for a replacement when its probably going to break again? And besides the point, a $180 controller and you only care if it works for 90 days and then we are SOL?? Screw that, Ill go back to my cheap controllers and never buy an elite controller again.

  Almost everything works perfectly with the controller except the top 2 paddles. You have to press directly where the little nub is on the paddle for them to work. I usually use the very edge of the paddle and it doesn't work. The bottom 2 work perfectly even with an audible click. The top 2 will only make the click if you press directly on the magnetic part of the paddle. Very sad to see that I paid this much and can't have a fully functioning controller.

    The Best Premium Xbox One Controller You Can Gat
  
",5.0,Brandon White,"Reviewed in the United States November 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  While I have never owned the original elite controller, I have used the similarly priced scuf Prestige and can hopefully shed some light on the features that each have to offer.First of all, you can tell right from opening the box that an extensive amount of R&D muscle was flexed in the making of this controller. The case is nice and compact, the controller feels heavy and we'll assembled, with no loose pieces on the actual unit other than the magnetically attached paddles on the back. It looks and feels like a premium controller should.Now, what about the features that separate it from a regular Xbox one controller? The built in plastic grip is surprisingly ergonomic and is about as comfortable as on the Prestige. The ergonomics of the controller in general feel much improved if you have medium to large hands. This is particularly noticeable in the placement of the paddles. The prestige's paddles we're bigger and attached more firmly, but the Elite 2's paddles are placed perfectly in just the right spot where my otherwise unused digits rest in the middle of the controller, making them much easier to manipulate.Then we have the hair triggers, and man, I am absolutely in love with these things. I tend to bounce back and forth from FPS games to racing, RPG, etc. and having the ability to switch to a decrease trigger pull length on the fly is easily the second biggest advantage of these premium controller options. While the scuf prestige only offered two setting options, this one has three. Even more importantly, the hair triggers are specifically calibrated so that there is a micrometer or so if give before they start sending input. This is crucial, as my scuf prestige would often respond to the slightest touch and even registered some input when I wasn't touching the controller at all.This leads into another feature that puts this controller well ahead of the prestige: it's integration with the Xbox accessories app. The prestige is essentially a bunch of hardware additions and modifications slapped onto the original controller. The Elite V2 is an entirely different animal. You can set specific button/paddle layouts which allow you to switch to them on the fly, and even designate a shift paddle/button to switch to another layout nomentarily. You can visually inspect the pressure curve of the hair triggers at different settings. Feel like your right thumbstick is too twitchy? Switch from the default linear input curve to a more gradual one. All this and more is available to you within seconds of opening the app.While it is certainly an investment, this controller has quickly become the best I have ever used. The love and care that was out into it's design was obvious, and I intend to use it at every opportunity.

  Maybe it's me but I had zero issues with series one or two. So coming from a pretty hard gamer who used both elite controllers and scuf this is the best. It's crisp, clean and responsive. The weight is slightly less than series one. The extra hair pin trigger setting is superb and the torsion settings for the joysticks are best in class. The app settings also make this literally the best fit for pretty much any gamer in any game. If you get one that is defective out of the box that stinks. But don't give up. Return it until you get a good one. You won't regret it.

  Out of the box the ""A"" button was sticky and would sometimes require you to move the button to unstick it. This made it basically useless for gaming. Overall, it just felt heavier than the standard controller with the grips feeling nicer. Everything else felt the same as far as pushing the buttons, moving the joysticks, etc. I expected a much nicer controller for $180. I put it back in the box 5 minutes after I opened it and requested a return because I was so disappointed.

  If you are looking at these for pc gaming DO NOT BUY. Bluetooth connectivity is a known issue. Controllers disconnect, cause massive frame rate drop somehow, forcing you to use the cord in a wired configuration. Google “elite series 2 bluetooth issue” and you will see hundreds of reddit posts etc. Even in a wired configuration, use of the paddles on the back causes frame rate drops. You might be reading this saying that doesnt even sound possible but I promise you, its happening to thousands of people just google the issue. Regular xbox controllers dont have this issue, older elite controllers with the wireless “adapter” dont have these issues. Only the new “series 2” controllers. There was an update for the controllers and that did not fix the issue.

  Feels nice, looks nice, extra buttons....that's it. Yes you can customize it a bit, but its not worth $100 more than the original. You also have to retrain your muscle memory to use the triggers properly.

When these work there's nothing like it. But for $170 bucks you'd like them to work for longer than 2 months or so.  There's NO customer service at Microsoft.  So buy one if you have money.

  The paddles, trigger stops, and customizable accessories are all perfect with the controller. The paddles are in a perfect position and very comfortable. The trigger stops work great and give you an edge when needing to click quickly. The ability to use a taller stick in first person shooters significantly helps the fine movements and increases your aim. But after about 90 days the left bumper started to stick and and I am now only able to click it once every 15 seconds or so. The left stick click also gave out about the same time. Clicking it repeatedly for a few seconds will get it to register but does not work 95% of the time. Contacted Microsoft to have it fixed, was told I would get an email from the support team to have it sent back. Never got an email. Contacted them via phone and was unable to get to a live person. Contacted them again through email and was told that my warranty expired and that there's nothing they would do unless I paid them. Got roughly 200 hours of use out of the controller and spent about 200$. A dollar for every hour of play time before the controller gives out. As nice as the controller is when it works, this was my worst purchase ever.

   Up until the controller stopped functioning as advertised, this controller was great! Great weight, internal rechargeable battery and adjustable triggers. That all ended when the rear paddle mapped to the 'B' button started to intermittently fail to register input. In the included video you can see how bad it gets. I figured I'd contact Microsoft for support, I had a similar issue with my 1st Gen Elite Controller and they fixed it within a week under warranty.Which leads me to my 1 star review. I understand complex electronics fail sometimes, what I can't understand is how a company like Microsoft can sell a product this expensive with a paltry 90 day warranty. That's absurd, 1 year warranties are ubiquitous at this point. I won't be buying Microsoft hardware without a full year warranty. Their hardware products are simply not up to the standards available in the market today.

  This controller is a definite upgrade from the 1st edition Elite! Don’t listen to the negative reviews about buttons being sticky or RB button being broken on arrival, If you just take good care of it. Aside from that, this controller feels comfortable, heavy in a good way due to the built in rechargeable battery. The battery is a big plus on this controller as well, it’s rechargeable with USB type C! What more could you want in a high end competitive controller? You can add the original elite paddles to this new one just fine. Although the series 2 paddles are a bit smaller but have a better response with hearing yourself click them which can be great if your into that. All in all this an amazing controller compared to the original elite. My original elite went through a lot of self repairs but I’ve owned it for 3-4 years so it lasted me long enough for the Series 2. Get this controller if your in need of an upgrade or are new to elite controllers the series 2 is a hands down better choice regardless of the price. IT WORTH IT!

My right bumper double presses constantly and my A button only registers half of time, something that is completely ridiculous for a controller that is almost $200! My problems only really showed up after a few months of use, so I thought I was okay because the pamphlet THAT COMES IN THE BOX says it has a ONE YEAR warranty, right? NOPE! 90 days only. So now I'm stuck with a expensive paperweight that only ""sometimes"" works. My regular Xbox One S controller that I've had for over a year now has NEVER had any issues at all.

  I was in need of an elite controller upgrade as my Gen 1’s grips were peeling off after 3 years of usage. The series 2 works great out the box, however, it feel more heavier and has more trigger resistance (out the box) than the Gen 1 and the grips are more textured so it takes time to get accustomed to. After 1-2 months of solid usage you’ll notice your character begin to move while you aren't actually moving. Sigh, I thought Xbox was past the drifting issue - my Gen 1 elite controller never had this in my 3 years of usage and I would have expected the same with the series 2.

  If you have the cash to spend on an expensive controller, you won't be disappointed with this one. It is built to a very high standard, feels great, looks great, excellent bonus features like removable bottom triggers with hair trigger settings, etc. My only slight complaint is that the handles could be a bit longer and it would fit me better. But I still love it.

  The materials used for this controller are very good and the feel of it is incredible.  Unfortunately I had to return mine because the right joystick had a spot where it would catch, and often the ""A"" button would not register key presses.  Having metal buttons like the d-pad can be a little wierd if you're used to normal plastic.  I'm also not fond of the placement of the paddles as they get in the way of having a solid grip on the controller.  I much prefer how SCUF controllers have them placed.

  I never had an XBOX controller before but this thing is boss.  I forgot how much I love my sony controllers.  The weight and the response from the buttons are amazing. I do get a little tingly sensation from the flaps on the under side of the controller when plugged in charging off my laptop. I just go wireless to avoid that.

  Microsoft apparently learned from the problems of the first Elite controller. This controller is light weight and fits comfortably in my hands. I was skeptical about having an integrated battery but so far the battery life has been excellent. Whenever I dropped my other Elite controller the rear paddles would fall out but I've not experienced this with the new controller.I would give this five stars but I'm waiting to see how well this product holds up over time.

  I received my controller and after about a month I noticed the Left Bumper would double click and sometimes not register fully. I have now owned the controller for less than three months and the left bumper is almost completely unresponsive and when it does work it double clicks. I reached out to the company hoping they would give me a replacement as I would ship my defective controller to them so they can determine what the issue was to prevent any future problems going forward and they refused.

  The Xbox Team officially responded to questions on here, saying this controller works on iPads/iOS. It doesn't. Even with the latest firmware, wired or bluetooth, it does not even show up to be registered on my devices. They later tried to correct this misinformation by saying ""It SHOULD work, but there might be some compatibility issues."" ""Some"" as in it doesn't work at all on my iPhone or iPad. These positive reviews are either lying or haven't tried for themselves.The bluetooth is another issue. It has very short reach. Trying to play Halo from my PC on my TV, the controller lost connection just a few feet away. Now, with buyer's remorse, I'm taking a closer look at these reviews and many seem to be having bluetooth problems.Lastly, I wish the buttons had more customization. Like some binds or something. I'm sure the back paddles are a nice quality of life feature for someone, but having 4 hair-trigger jump buttons isn't that useful to me.:'(

  As far as the controller itself goes, I absolutely love it. It's the greatest controller I've ever used...when it works. Just a few months after purchase (shortly after the initial warranty expired) the left and right bumpers stopped working reliably. Recently the left thumb stick began failing, shortly after I found out about the one year warranty extension. The technical support website is a bit convoluted and unhelpful, which would be tolerable if not for the fact that phone tech support isn't offered for controllers. Having paid over $200 for this controller, this lack of customer support is pretty outrageous. I'm kicking myself for not investing in an extended warranty when I purchased it, but honestly a controller at that price point shouldn't be failing within months with such poor support.

  I like Xbox controllers better than play station controllers generally, but this is unacceptable.

If I’m not yanking on my stick, when I let go it’s natural resting point is down. This is absolutely ridiculous. This is the second controller I’ve bought because the first one the left bumper stopped working AND had a drift in BOTH sticks after a little less than a year. Bought NEW BOTH times.

  I love the original Elite controller and as such, preordered the Series 2. Was excited to receive it back in November. Felt a bit better than the original but certainly not a night and day difference. After a week, the left thumb stick stopped clicking in. It worked sometimes but didn't give any feedback when being pressed. In mid-April, the right bumper started acting up. Would take several presses to work or wouldn't at all. I opened a case w/MS which was promptly closed as it was already outside the warranty (90 days). I've seen a lot of others reporting similar problems with the S2 online. A 90 day warranty for a $180 controller is ridiculous. My original Elite still works perfectly. I am very disappointed in the Series 2 and would strongly suggest saving your money.

  I am someone who has enjoyed Console gaming for decades.  I broke away from PC during that time based on finances and became quite used to console gaming and controller gaming. Then, I finally got a decent PC once again to game and stream from.  The transition from controller to PC ruined me for controller gaming.  Then I got my hands on the elite controller.  The ability to customize every aspect of it from the extra paddles, the tension of the thumbsticks, the curve of the thumbsticks....while it still cant compare to the customization levels and accuracy of a mouse it certainly closes the gap much better than any other controller I have used since the conversion.  HIGHLY recommended if you are a PC gamer that is looking for something to step up your console or controller gaming capabilities.

  Update: After 6 months, the left thumbstick has produced some rotational give. The peg to which you attach the sticks is what can be rotated, so swapping or replacing the sticks does not alleviate the issue. For its issues, cost, and limited 90-day warranty, ultimately, this controller was a disappointing purchase.Previously: Everything about the controller is fantastic, except for the face buttons. Sometimes when you press them softly or from an angle, for example coming down on A from Y, the button presses but won't trigger a response. If you are conscious of the issue, you can press hard enough to trigger the button press. It is disappointing for such an expensive, and otherwise well-crafted controller.

  Got it as a way to spoil my husband and he absolutely loves it. At first he was kind of irritated because I spent so much money on a controller, but after a few games he was like “gotta admit this controller is really nice”, so ladies if you’re looking at this to give to your husband, boyfriend, etc it’s really worth it, lowkey getting myself one as well lol.

  this this ""drifts"" like crazy.  in a fast paced game you wont notice it.  but if you play a game where you don't have to run around and aim, then you will notice a significant drifting of the center of your focus.Currently, there are multiple class action lawsuits from the US and EUR pending on both the Elite 1 and Elite 2 models.

  The controller worked great until about day 80 . The right thumb stick stopped working properly. The thumb stick when pushed up wouldn't  move the character ,  left and right worked fine ,  down worked sometimes . I went into the customization menu and tried to improve the problem, it did nothing. I used the controller daily for up to 4 hours. The controller is now useless . Contacted microsoft and they said my warranty is expired , said I activated the controller and from that date it shows its expired , I didn't activate the controller. How do you even do that? .So no it is not expired , I bought it Feb 11 and the problem occurred May 1st, and I contacted them a few days later through email.  So now I have a $180 paper weight. Don't take your chances with this one , unless you don't care about your money.

  When the controller works, it's the best controller ever made. However I've gone through 3 controllers with the same issue. The right trigger on the shortest trigger stop setting ""creaks"". When pressed down it's not solid. It doesn't stop like it's supposed. The left side has been solid on all 3 controllers but not the right. Ive received replacements months apart with the same issue so it's not a bad batch. I don't beat the controller up. It's just plain bad design and cheap manufacturing. I'm going to keep requesting new ones till I get what I paid for. A 200 dollar controller should be solid.

  I love this controller. It’s fantastic. I love the paddles on the bottom side and it’s my favorite way to play... or it was. After three months though, with significant weekly play time, the thumbsticks started to drift. Didn’t think much of it, and didn’t know the base warranty had already run out. But now another month later and the drift for my controller has been so extreme that I can barely play many games. It’s frustrating beyond belief. If you buy one, which I do recommend, get an extended warranty. The Microsoft store has a 3 year warranty available as well, so food for thought...A little time further on, and now the D-pad and triggers have gone on to be less than fully functional. How did the best controller turn out to be my worst Xbox purchase? Ugh.

   Just received my controller today on Friday, got all excited for the weekend. Was planning on playing with the new controller but just getting the controller set up I realized the “X”button getting stuck half the time and the “A” button you have to press firm because it doesn’t sense it every time you press it. $180 controller I’d expect it to last longer than not even a day of use. Pretty disappointed. I would like a brand new controller replacement, I’ll return this hunk of junk. Thank you.

  I upgraded from the series 1 to the series 2 for the adjustable resistance on the analog sticks. One of my biggest complaints of any controller has been how ""soft"" the analog joysticks move. I love that with a few twist of the internal component of the joysticks stiffens up the joysticks. The adjustable 3 stage triggers are nice as well. My favorite feature though is the internal battery. I've tried AA batteries, rechargeable batteries, battery packs on the series 1 and never got more than a day of two (if I was lucky) of gaming out of them. The saving of batteries was worth the purchase alone. It is probably the best designed controller I've used.

  This controller is near perfect.  The weight, the grip, the sticks, the buttons, the paddles all feel very solid and respond as perfectly as possible.  Lots of options to ""make it your own"", and I did with a stiffer resistance on the left stick and a longer stick on the right.I could give it a minus for built in battery, however AA batteries are also annoying.  With that said, the battery hasn't died after 20+ hours of gaming.

  2 stars because everything else about the controller is awesome. Feels good in my hand and the weight hasn't been a problem. My hands do seem to sweat more with this controller but that hasn't affected my gameplay. The 'A' button works probably 90% of the time though, which HAS affected my gameplay, and that's a shame. I've read that some people use one of the paddles in place of the 'A' button, and someone else came up with a fix using tape. Sigh. I was hoping that at this point any hardware or firmware faults would have been resolved. I'm planning on returning this and maybe cross my fingers buy get another. I looked into the SCUF controller, but that has its own problems.

  I wanted to like this controller and I've tried twice now. Each controller has been defective, sticky buttons and buttons that don't register presses even though they click. You can make it work, if you press the button in the perfect way the click will register and the button won't stick. But if pressure is uneven or you press the ""wrong"" part of the button, the button will click but won't register a press.TWO controllers now both the exact same issues with the A button (sticking), and all the buttons exhibiting button registering issues depending on where you press the button. Very disappointed in this product overall.

  This is by far the best controller I had ever used when it was new.  Sadly, some of the buttons started to get flakey after only a couple months of use and Microsoft was not accepting warranty claims due to ""shelter in place"" issues.  A quick search around the internet reveals that I am far from alone in experiencing this rapid degradation.Now that the warranty is up (I pre-ordered mine) Microsoft is offering to repair it for $99.  This is more than a new pro controller from another popular brand with a 1-year warranty.In short, I strongly recommend against this product.  It has an extremely short life at a very premium price.  Do not fall for Microsoft's videos about the millions of button presses this controller can withstand.  It cannot.  This controller is very likely to break your heart as soon as the sad, little warranty expires.

And playing FPS games those buttons are crucial. I would strongly advise you do not purchase this controller used I knew the potential risk of buying something used and it didn’t work out in my favor.

  It's definitely am upgrade from the conventional Xbox controllers. Especially for FPS, however, after a year of using it for gaming it began to have issues. The right bumper began to not respond well and it worsened as I used it more and more. For a 100+ dollar controller I expect these issues to not occur and the reason I got the Elite controller 2 was to replace my old xbox one controller which worked fine for 3 years with little issues. The controller is great but I would think about it before splashing the cash because if it's giving you the issues that I got then you might as well buy the 60 dollar ones.

My original elite controller lasted a couple of years before the bumpers broke but I was able to fix them by taking apart the controller. This controller is not as easy to take apart.

  Likes: The color is cool, light weight, four paddles, and custom binds.***This controller is far from elite though***Dislike: After three months of using this controller the RB button started to stick. Tried replacing it through Microsoft because my warranty isn't up yet. It has been around two weeks and they didn't send me a shipping label. Contacted them numerous times and they keep saying ""24hrs""After a week or two of using it I mistakenly told one of my gaming buddies to get this same controller. Well, he did and the same thing is happening to him.The product has potential, but its customer service and hardware issues like this that push people away.

    Bumpers Failing 5 months in
  
",1.0,Timothy Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States June 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought this controller back in November, at launch, after my elite series 1 failed after about 15 months. About 5 months of use I can already tell my bumpers are not nearly as responsive as they should be. Frankly sometime they double hit and other times they wont respond at all. Often I need to press much harder than I should need to to get them to register. So disappointed that a $200 dollar controller(with tax) already isn't working. I've spent $500 dollars on elite controllers in the last 3 years and I will never buy another one. Save your  money or buy this with an extended warranty from somewhere like Best Buy.

  The A button on my controller and the replacement I got both dropped inputs. Specifically, the problem seemed to happen the most when it was pressed from any direction other than straight down. So if I press with my thumb slightly off center to the left or right, sometimes the button press doesn't get registered. Unusable for even the most casual gaming.I don't know if I just got two duds from a bad batch, and frankly, I have no intention of trying my luck with a third. The expectation with a nearly $200 controller is that it will work out of the box. This controller did not meet that expectation.

  I got the controller straight out of the box, checked it out made sure there were no defects before using it. Outside there were no defects. When I started using it I realized the “B” button was not working 100% of the time but I thought I would just have to use it a little more to get the controller working right. Now here we are 3/4 of a year later and half of the buttons do not work including the “LB” “A” “X” do not work now 100% of the time. I would ask for a replacement but I’m sure it’s too late for that. But at least it does what it’s supposed to do even though it’s not not 100% there...

  I purchased this controller in January. Received it on Jan 30th. It is April 3rd and my left joystick has a severe drift that makes it almost impossible to play with. It had started almost a month ago, I figured it would be deadzones or some of the settings within the curve settings for controllers on Xbox. I’ve tried every setting you could think of. This is so disappointing. I would have been happier if the controller lasted at least a year like I have gotten from both of the Xbox elite 1 controllers. I can’t justify spending almost $200 now(yes the price went up again which happened as soon as Covid19 hit, I have been watching the pricing) for the same controller to be disappointed so quickly.  It may be time to try scuff.PS: This is the first negative review I have written on amazon with a 6 year history using Amazon.

  From day 1, the 'A' button has intermittently failed to respond on press. Pretty much makes it unusable in a competitive environment, which you'd imagine, given the price, is their target audience.A quick google search shows this isn't an isolated issue - it appears widespread and almost defective by design. And the worst part, for close to $200 you'd hope the company would address it, but they have not, and with the recent release of the XBox Series X, they likely won't.I'd avoid until they recall the device. If you really need paddles on your controller, off-brand ones (e.g. scuf/thrustmaster) may prove more promising. If you need disappointment, look no further.

And the bottom right paddle is a bit iffy tooEdit: got a second one and buttons seem fine but the right stick, while on the highest tension setting, will become literally stuck to any of the up, right, or down directions entirely.

A class action lawsuit has been filed against Microsoft for this problem.

  This controller is a good controller to play with. With all the adjustable features and the paddles on the back it does make f gaming nicer. Problem is the quality is not good. After a week and a half the right stick click stopped clicking. Then there are people with issues of stick drift. What happened to the days where premium electronics were built with quality to last.

  One of the sticks on the controller came broken, almost like it was jammed up. I returned it and mentioned that it was defective to have the company tell me that they will only give me a partial refund because it was broke due to “customer error”. Regardless of me informing them that I literally took it out of the box and my brother set it up to use it, only to discover he couldn’t me properly in his game, then we packed it up to return it again. It’s honestly ridiculous and if I were you, I would be cautious about ordering from this company. If anything, go to Best Buy or Target and just spend the money in person.

No signs of it sticking and when I closed the circuit on the switch it worked everytime so wasn't the board.

  So apparently there was a lawsuit that someone filed (you can easily google for more details) which seems to have resulted in the controller getting an extended default warrany (1 year instead of 90 days) for anyone who buys the controller. This was due to a large number of people having numerous issues. I believe there was a statement saying the issues only occured to the first batches that shipped out, but I just ordered my third controller (the first 2 had A and X buttons that were unresponsive 5% of the time), hoping the third is better. Aside from that the controller feels amazing though.

  The quality is unmatched, no corners cut, and overall feels premium at every moment of use. The list of features for this remote is exactly what you would want for this price point. The compatability is another thing to admire. Works with windows as well as Bluetooth,  and now with the implementation of XCloud gaming for Android, it feels even more worth the purchase. Also works with next gen expectedly and thankfully, so no worries. After 3 solid months of heavy use and one rough drop, this thing is as tough and quality as you would want and need.

  This controller feels and works wonderfully out of the box. However, after only six months of use(Beyond the 3 month warrantee), the left bumper started to only work only some of the time, so I had to take apart the controller to hopefully fix the issue. What was the issue....a small plastic shim between the bumper and the sensor which has deformed with use. Not sure if this was overlooked, a designed failure point to protect the internal sensor, or a way for Microsoft to make $$$ by charging for repairs. Whatever the reason, it is unacceptable that the standard $60 controller can easily last more that two years without issue but the $180 elite, “high-Quality”,  controller barely makes it 6 months.

  Nice, an improvement over the Series 1, but don't see a reason to get this if your Series 1 is still working though.  Only complaint... where did the mid height sticks go... you either have short or tall... I want tall on the right stick and a mid range on the left stick.  They had these on the Series 1... why are they missing from the Series 2?

  I owned the first elite controller and can say that this one is much better. Once you get used to using the triggers underneath you will have an edge especially in FPS games. The short throw triggers are also great for shooters. Overall you can tell this controller was built to last, the previous version broke and the grips fell off after about 2 years.

  This controller has the perfect feel and features for a truly great controller. I wish I could recommend it to other gamers, but the simple fact is that much of the hardware begins breaking down after only a few months.The first thing to go on my controller was the bumper buttons. Half of the time no button press is registered, and if they do finally register a press, it always ends up as a double click. This problem started after about 4 months of use (just past the 90 day warranty).If you can afford a 180 dollar disposable controller 2 or 3 times a year, then this item is definitely made for you.

  Great controller overall and fixed many issues that pertained to the original elite series. It can also connect to most phones via bluetooth and the tension joysticks are a great implication. Only two  problems that I have found is that the a button does not work when pressed unless you press it directly in the middle. Which isn't a huge problem but when your just watching stuff it gets annoying. The second issue is that they only give you two joystick sizes and the second size is just one long stick as well as a rounded short one. I would prefer two long ones. The short smooth ones are pointless I think. I would highly recommend this controller to anybody that loves gaming.

  I went through three of these and they all had one shared problem: large deadzones on both sticks. A regular xbox one controller does not have this issue so I see no reason why a $180 dollar controller should, it's just unacceptable. The quality control on these is non existant. I was lucky enough to have just this issue, aside from one of them having a faulty paddle button. If you search on reddit for the global thread post on these there are many more issues that people are having. The rest of the controller feels amazing though so props to Microsoft for getting that right and thats the reason why I giving it at least 3 stars. If I were you, I would wait until they release a version that are less broken, because this ain't it chief.

  I wrote a terrible review based on my own unintelligent observation. This controller is great!First off, don't buy this controller unless your gonna use the selective modes! If you play more then one game get this cobtroller. If you play just one, this will still help but it would keep you versatile! The carrying case has a port to plug in the wireless dock. You can also just plug it straight into the controller. All together amazing controller

Also I think this is a knockoff is some sort.  There are no profile indicator lights, only two hair trigger selections, and no charging dock!!  Cant give a zero star rating!

  This was the best controller I ever had while it still worked.  It also broke faster than any controller I ever owned.  I was hoping to get more than 14 months out of a $180 controller but I guess not.  Also, Xbox will not even speak with you about your controller after the warranty has expired.  Its, ""buy a new one or get out!"".It was a good 14 month though.

  Only seems to work plugged in. Bluetooth is very glitchy. It will connect for around 30 minutes and operate fine, and then an array of issues will occur. Buttons not responding, Thumbsticks drift, and disconnection from Bluetooth. It makes it very hard to enjoy a game when you’re troubleshooting the controller every 30 minutes. It can be remedied, but I’d recommend a controller that you don’t have to fidget with routinely.The other stuff is great, carrying case, swappable buttons and thumbsticks, but all in all is useless if you can’t operate it.

  No issues except the left joystick lost its tactile feedback, the click sound when you click it in, after about 8 months. The first one, the rubber grips started to peel after about 6 months, it’s been about 9 months since I’ve had the Series 2, and the rubber grips haven’t even started to peel. Overall, in my opinion, it’s worth it if you are willing to spend that amount of money.

  Everything came packaged properly but there were a couple problems. Firstly the controller was still greasy as if just used before shipping, front right side grip was popped out slightly but went right back easily, and the magnetic paddles are either worn out or the magnets are weakened so to use the paddles you have to pressed the base of the paddle which defeats the purpose of the paddle which is to allow ease of use in Gaming. Also both notches for the trigger locks are chipped.

",1.0,Joe Cooper,"Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  Absolutely inexcusable for a product to cost 3x as much as a standard controller and break just as frequently if not more. Honestly, I have Xbox One controllers from 2014 that still work like a charm, yet I bought this in January and already the buttons stick and don't always register when I'm pressing them. Even if regular controllers break as often, you can still get three of those for the price of one of these. I love the design and feel of this controller, but cannot recommend it when it breaks like this.

  For the first couple months is was great.  Very similar feeling to the Series 1, which I also own (and which my wife inherited).  Then the RB started to register inconsistently.  I play Rocket League and that button is my boost button, so launching and going up for a touch only to have your boost stop because the button isn't registering is incredibly frustrating.  I remember seeing videos about the design of this product and much was made of the durability enhancements.  Apparently Microsoft is aware of the issues and is going to release a new SKU to fix it.  So I guess I'll wait for that.  Back to the plastic cheapie for now !

  The Elite is a great product in concept, a really comfortable and high-end looking PC controller, it's just too bad about the build quality. I've owned two of the first generation and bought a Series 2 in January in hopes that Microsoft addressed the quality control issues from their first attempt. No such luck as in less that six months the left stick has stopped responding to pushing up, and the several buttons have stopped being responsive as well. Seems like Microsoft knew about these issues as the warranty period for the controller is only 90 days, will not make this mistake again.

  Be very careful buying this. My ABXY button presses only register maybe 70% of the time. Otherwise the controller has an excellent feel and build quality. The removable attachments are made of metal and feel very nice. The battery lasts forever and the case can also be a charger. Programming buttons layouts and configurations is really easy and works great. It's just a shame that the face buttons don't work reliably.

I even attempted to send the controller to Microsoft to repair although 3-4 months is out of warranty. So I’d have to purchase a replacement controller I’ve only used for roughly 60 days. For close to a $200 price mark I’d expect to get my money’s worth, this controller is not built to last. I play games such as FIFA , CoD , NBA 2k, Forza etc..Pay for the warranty. These controllers are faulty

    Trigger button randomly stops working

  At first everything was great. Good quality, nice grip etc. the reason for the 3 stars is because I play call of duty. And the past week or so the trigger buttons have been acting super super weird. I’m not sure how to explain it right but I’ll have my submachine gun out and instead of me having to just hold the trigger to release the bullets I have to keep pulling the trigger as if it’s a pistol. At first I thought it was just my interchangeable components messing up but the same thing happened with my regular LT and RT buttons. Any ideas ????

  When I first got it, it was an amazing controller and I loved playing with it. However over the last few months it has had multiple functionality failures. It first started with the left trigger getting stuck for about 2 days and this went away just by working through it over time. Then it was stick drift, which was modest but still a recently bought controller for nearly $200 should not have stick drift. Then most recently, both bumpers have all together stopped working. I can not recommend highly enough that if you get this controller, you get a warranty for it. I wish I did.

    Another reason to buy 3rd party
  
",2.0,Michael,"Reviewed in the United States October 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  The controller worked fine itself, but the fact that it's interwoven into Microsoft functions is just asking for trouble.  I don't know if MS pushed an update or something, but the controller now messes with functions outside of the game on my PC.  In the middle of the game, it's altering volume and interacting with media apps.  No software options to limit this that I saw.  Buy 3rd party to avoid these companies pushing bad code that makes it essentially unusable.

  Im not a super hardcore gamer but I usually get about 4 hours of playtime in per day and this controller has lasted me perfectly for the past 4 months with no signs of deterioration or malfunction. By far the biggest use of this controller for me is the battery life. I can leave this unplugged for days and not even have to worry about it dying, and when it does get low I just pop it in the case and its full in under 2 hours.

  Absolutely will not hold up.  This controller has been the source of so much frustration and anxiety when I'm gaming.  It is faulty right out of the box and has multiple issues including double sensing bunpers, unresponsive face buttons, and stick drift.  This is by far the biggest slap in the face I've ever felt with a controller.  And Microsoft support is so unhelpful that I might as well have never had a warranty.  Complete turn off from all 1st party Xbox controllers from here out.  Ridiculous

  You really should not believe that if you buy this controller it won’t have problems. Mine right out the box had missed A button presses as well as missed rb presses. There is an absolutely massive thread on reddit describing theses issues as well as many others. There are multiple reports of people sending this controller back to Microsoft and getting another one back with the same issues or worse. Many of these people have sent back the controller 3+ or more times. Such a disappointment to know I won’t be getting a working controller for $180.

  Controller feels nice. The buttons feel improved. The bumpers and triggers feel more solid especially now with the grip on the trigger. Sadly the magnetic sticks are still way too heavy. Flicking the stick even on highest tension you will get recoil because of the heavy nature of the metal sticks. On the old elite I got around this by opening it up and putting in sticks from the regular xbox one controllers, but this controller doesn't look like it will be as easily modified. If you dont care about the kick back from the stick flick then by all means its a solid controller.

  This is the first Elite series controller I have owned. And I must say, its pretty good! If you're an intense gamer and are somewhat heavy on analog controls then this controller is definitely for you! I am experiencing a slight issue with the bumper double tapping on rare occasions, but other then that this controller rocks!

  Awesome, just awesome. I can’t imagine playing with a regular controller after experiencing an elite series 2. I was worried cause some of the other reviews were mixed, and maybe I just got lucky that mine had no issues. It seems to last days on one charge. The charging cradle makes charging the controller effortless. I love the preset switch that allows for three different configuration profiles, switching between games is no longer a hassle. Its a beast.

  I've had my elite 2 for a pretty solid time now and it was great while it lasted. I mainly played Rainbow 6 with it and never beat it up or anything like of the such and yet my right stick is completely messed up now. It drifts for one and two the tension on the joystick is lighter to the left than the right giving and uneven feel on the joystick making it difficult to use. Id say it lasted me 6 months and it was good while it did.

    Great controller with one huge problem
  
",4.0,Dylan Pratt,"Reviewed in the United States February 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  My only issue is that it only comes with one dome top analog stick and for so reason the controller will turn off by itself from time to time during a play session. I love the new trigger stops and the rest of the build has held up better than the original version so far. Im hoping a future update will fix the issue causing the controller to turn off by itself which isnt too big of a deal but it has hurt me in competitive play before.

  The controller was great at first. Now the left stick has a very big drift problem. I have recently become aware that there is a class action lawsuit against Microsoft for this issue. I could not find a way to submit any information to this lawsuit so I am leaving this review. I can't return or exchange this item through amazon anymore apparently, unless hopefully this gets someone's attention. I paid $200 for this essentially unusable product.

  Worked fine for about 30 hours of game play. Then it developed an occasional drift on the left stick. I didn't really mind it. But now it has stopped input to my pc. I don't play on xbox, just pc. The controller connects to my pc in both wired and wireless modes but pressing the buttons has no impact. The clicks are registered on the Xbox accessories app but not outside the app or in the games. At the same time, my old Xbox one controller connects and plays normally.

  Be very careful when purchasing controllers on amazon, it may not have physical damage but it can still be very defective.

  When I first received my controller, it had mushy A and B buttons, which required very accurate and hard presses to register. This went away after a week or so.

  The controller is clearly made with the best materials but with that said it feels like these are in Such high demand that they are poorly put together. So both joysticks give a lot of drift specifically for fortnite.

   The controller worked amazingly, no problems or anything, but not even 2 months old and starts malfunctioning like this. Making it effectively unusable

  I am not satisfied with this The analog stick ended up tearing up and the button on the back of the controller came off I send a complaint A month ago about and never got an answer from them about it so my suggestion is just buy one at the store that doesn’t cost that much you can almost buy a new Gaming system for that price

  I got the controller Nov 19th of last year. The 'A' button is already sticking, and generally not what I expected. I expect a quality product, but feel like this was either refurbished or just a shoddy product.

  This is my 3rd xbox elite series 2 controller within a year....the buttons do not last. Unfortunately. This is an incredible controller but the quality, durability and reliability just is not there. This one only lasted 3 months. Never been dropped. Sits in its case. LB button and B button became very unresponsive. Makes it impossible to play with. I dont recommend buying if your hard on controllers.

    Terrible drift on day 1
  
",1.0,Susan Hecker,"Reviewed in the United States October 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  So my controller comes in and I’m having a good time using it and then about an hour into playing, the left stick already is starting to drift pretty bad, and they claimed to have fixed this issue so basically I’m really frustrated that I’ve just wasted 180 dollars on something that I got to use for 1 hour. Thanks Xbox for making a great product! (That was sarcasm lol)

  Best controller on the market at the moment imo. The grips feel amazing and don’t peel. The paddles are firm enough not to click too easily (Like when setting it down on your leg) but have the perfect pressure and response time. Comes with a charger and travel case. Say goodbye to batteries forever.

  Got my elite 2 on day of release, felt solid. However, 2 weeks ago my left thumb stick no longer clicks in, you only have to apply very light pressure for the left stick press to register so it’s really difficult to play, sprinting happens when you don’t want it to.

",1.0,Grump Doggo,"Reviewed in the United States July 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  Out of the box the left bumper wasn't working so I contacted Microsoft for a repair and sent it in via UPS. When I got the controller back the left stick was drifting upwards constantly and I am now sending it in for a second time. Unacceptable for a $180 controller.

  This is honestly the best controller I've ever used. The gripping around the controller leads to less sweaty hands and more grip. The trigger stops changed my view of Xbox controllers forever. Plus there is all the modularity of the sticks, dpad and back paddles. My only complaint is that you can't have the Xbox logo dimmed without having it set to another mode, causing there to be another light that ends up being brighter on as well.

",1.0,Timothy Mertens,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  First purchase after hearing all the reviews it feels nice in your hand but a lot of problems. The molding around the joysticks doesn’t play well with the magnetic tops, meaning it doesn’t allow for full range of motion.Also there is significant drift on my left joystick. Happy amazon let me return it quickly and easily. I’ll stick with the regular ones for now. Until these are worth the money.

  Dont waste your money. Buy a regular old $60 remote because they do the exact same thing and break in the exact same way. I bought this $200 PoS and had stick drift within 5 months. Now I have the pleasure of dealing with Microsoft support to try and get it replaced. Good times. Again, dont waste your money, its not worth it.
