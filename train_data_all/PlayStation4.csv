  Bought one of these around Black Friday in 2018, it crashed dead on me within a year. Made a warranty claim, and received a refurbished replacement in a fairly short time. The replacement also crashed dead in just over a year.Conclusion the PS4 slim is an absolute piece of trash, do not waste even a single dollar on this system. Side note, my original PS4 is still going strong after many years, so it‚Äôs the slim version that should be avoided.

  I'll start off by saying I own both the Xbox and ps4, while my Xbox has been pretty good even with the addition of features like game pass giving me the ability to play the game on pc or console if i choose was amazing. Now to why the ps4 gets a hard 1.Ps4 is severely limited to how fast you can even download/update games. With a 1 gig fios connection I could get a max of 8 megs a sec while the Xbox could hit 50+ easily. Over the years I've owned the same game too on both consoles since I have friends who play on diff platforms. Games like dead by daylight have horrid FPS on the ps4 while on the xbox has been humming most of these games along easily.While I was able to look over most of these issues as just a ""oh well that's just the way it is"" the final straw for this console was them refusing to refund a 1 year psn+ sub I didn't order when I requested it the same day. I then found out through some digging that the console has for alot of people turned on automatic renewal even after they've confirmed it off.Sadly all my console issues over the years has been because of the customer service with PlayStation more than anything they are a very anti consumer friendly company and will do what they can to hold onto every $$ they get from you.

",5.0,Alfred J. Parks,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2021","









  
  
    
  I was very pleased with the play station 4 console that I purchased a few months ago.  The graphics are very realistic however, with some games there is Live action so realistic as to cause motion sickness.  This usually clears up after a short break.  All of the newer play station consoles are missing one extremely important design feature which should make it compatible with all the older ps1 and ps2 gaming software. all of the older Kingdom Hearts games have been reproduced on new software made for ps4 however, most of my favorite ps2 games have not been considered by Sony for remarketing in the new ps4 format. I would like to buy a ps4 version of ps2's World Championship Poker if Crave Entertainment and Sony would agree to produce a new ps4 disc high definition version without any off line gameplay or character creation modifications to its current design. I like this game because, I can play it off line with simulated opponents at no cost.

",2.0,LORENA,"Reviewed in the United States April 1, 2020","









  
  
    
  The PS4 is great!  It works amazingly.  Meant as a birthday gift, the receiver was very excited as he can also watch Amazon prime video on it as well.  The issue is the packaging of the console.  Upon opening the Amazon box, the recipient saw it was a PlayStation bundle box.  Meant to include 3 games with it.  The sides of the box had been torn into to remove the games.  When the recipient of the gift saw this, he was upset because he believed he was getting the games as well.  When he saw the damage to the box, he believed someone at Amazon had stolen his games.  I don't understand the reasoning for Amazon shipping me the console in such a way.  If you buy a standard sedan, you don't gift it in a box that says Porsche.  Be aware that when you order this, it may come in a box implying that you paid for games you won't get.

  This was supposed to be a brand new PS4 slim. Not only is there wear and tear on both the remote and the console but the console has a crack in it. On top of that the power cord for both the console and the controller are not the correct size or shape to fit either one. This was supposed to be a Christmas present and this is now three days of trying to get a refund and to send this back.

  I had quite a history with Sony and their Playstations, however, after getting the PS4, it broke randomly and my disks wouldn't load. I got a replacement for 100$ which is outrageous after having a warranty, and immediatly the new one broke down. It wouldn't turn on. Very bad experiance.

  Fair warning, the console doesn't exactly have 1TB of storage - it has around 840GB.Now, reviewing it as a product, if you wanted a PS4 this is the best deal you'll get (I've seen this go as low as $250 once)... provided you don't care for fancy 4k resolution and all that (and if you want to get technical, the PS4 Pro doesn't actually have legitimate 4k built-in). Only negative I can find is that the fan can be a little loud sometimes, but I've never witnessed it overheat at all.Now reviewing it as a console: obviously better performing than the Switch and its library is not a complete joke like the Xbox One (and its million different models), stuff that the average gamer already knows. It *is* a shame though that in today's modern gaming environment you can't just slap a disc inside it and start playing immediately - be prepared for mandatory installations (ranging anywhere from 15gb to 80gb -looking at you FFXV-) before you can enjoy your game. This is why the first thing I mentioned was why it doesn't exactly have 1TB of storage, sadly you will have to carefully manage your storage.

  2 months after purchasing my PS4 randomly shut off while I was playing a game, the console restarted and went into safe mode requesting a reinstallation of the latest firmware 7.51. I tried initiating the upgrade but it would just cancel its progress midway, after doing further research I realized it may be related to the HD when removing the HD that was in the playstation this is what I found, the HD is heavily scratched and dented but these guys sold me the console ‚Äúbrand new‚Äù luckily I was able to use an external hard drive I had lying around to replace this to avoid sending it back to Sony for repair.

  Bought this in May, died in July...doesnt even power on at all.  Tried everything to get it to work, new cable, different outlet, everything we can find online for troubleshooting.  Not a thing worked.  Soo, since it didnt have a warranty, my 13 year old son looked up online on how to take it apart to see if there were any bugs inside, or broken parts that we cant see.  Nothing can be found.  So the only thing we can think of that is the issue, the power supply doesnt work anymore.  Now we got a big hunk of plastic just sitting here and am out $350...waste of money honestly.  Didnt even bother trying to contact the seller cause many of the other bad reviews I see on here indicates that the seller aint gonna respond.

  I just recently received my PS4 and the console works just fine, but controller has some issue,it will let me go select a game/application I have and once I get into the game/ application it won't work at all, my friend and I thought it was just the game so we tested out on her's and it worked just fine and we went back to mine and she brought her own game and controller and when she used her controller it worked. The console works but you might have an issue with the controller working in game or in an application

  What I got was a box full of disappointment. I read the reviews, I was concerned of what I would actually get. Soul shattering sadness was what I was bracing for, ready & welcoming that deep cold chill of regret that only a terrible purchase would grant. The ad said ""New"". It was. I was expecting the PS4 system to at least have rust on it. No...it's new...not even a chew mark from a dog. Everything was wrapped like it came out of a factory assembly line. New. I have a sensitive nose. Honed from many years of terrible smells and burnt cooking from relationships that lasted far to long.......I was expecting cigarette or ""herbal"" smells. No. this thing is new. It destroyed my fearful expectations. All I'm left to do now is enjoy Kingdom Hearts III & Streetfighter5...I'm terrible at both..... I mean, it even had the HDMI cable. I guess that I am not unhappy with the purchase.

",5.0,gigabytes,"Reviewed in the United States February 7, 2021","









  
  
    
  This is a great system for the price I paid for it, but  I already seem to be having a problem with it, after only 3 days of use. The controller that came with it seems to have an issue. I looked up why the controller would be blinking and an article in a forum stated that it could be one of 2 problems, 1)the battery in the controller is dying (I've been charging it nightly after use, so???) and/or the charging cable is not connected right. and it listed a set of steps to follow to fix said problem, including re-pairing the controller with the system. So far this is the only problem I've had with it, so I don't see any reason, yet, to return/exchange this item. It's a great little system.

  The system works flawlessly and I love it, it's everything a PS4 should be.But the controller has had an issue from day 1. The X button sometimes sticks. No new controller I've ever had in my 30 years of gaming has had a sticky button out of the box. That should never happen. Eventually I'll get a spare controller (or replacement if I just cannot get it to stop sticking), and those aren't exactly cheap either.

  I have a Playstation for a few games but none of them are working well.  Spyro is the game I wanted most but it doesn't work.  The controller has next to no life and all I can use the thing for is a blue ray player.  Not worth the price, not worth the few games that are exclusive and not worth the continued failure that is Sony.  Get a Switch if you are wanting most of the games on this system or get them on PC.

  I've had the same Xbox for 4 years straight no problem at all. Got this for my gf so she could have some exclusives and I love spotify. This thing buzzes loudly when a disc is inserted and has already shut itself off because of the poor quality and inability. I was always a PlayStation fan so I was excited to finally acquire another, but I've been so disappointed. I give the extra star specifically for the spotify support.

  Bought it during boxing week sale so it's a good deal. There is already an upgraded version of PS4 that is the PS4 Pro, but at the time of purchase that didn't add much value for non 4k TVs. I would recommend this over PS4 Pro if you don't own a 4k TV. However, now they've updated the software on PS4 Pro to boost visual performance on even non 4K TVs, so if you don't mind the little extra cash I suggest you get that instead.

  I bought the PS4 Slim on sale thinking I had a great deal on my hands. First week the system worked fine and then the errors started to happen. Games would freeze and crash and the system would shut off by itself. I looked online for any solutions but unfortunately most of them involved  clearing out my PS4 by ‚Äúinitializing‚Äù which takes several hours to do so and wiping out all data on the system making me re-dowload my games. I saw many PS4 owners have the same problems I was having even with their own brand new consoles which made me reconsider owning a PS4.I never had these problems with the Xbox One and with my refund I‚Äôm probably going back to it.

  Once I got this with the new God of War (2018) game I immediately fell in love with it. Once I finished the new GOW I repeatedly played it over and over and couldn't believe the time that passed. I so wish I could erase this part of my memory and experience the thrill and joy all over again like I did the first time I played it. In my review for the new 2018 GOW game I said the sequel cannot come out fast enough, but I will happily wait because the hard work that will go in to the sequel cannot not go unnoticed I am sure and I am dying to find out the next part of the story!!

  I bought this for myself, and I'm happy that it's still doing fine after about a month now. I have had no issues, I've been able to play multiple disk games without a problem. There were no physical damages either. All the necessary parts are included in the box, and it comes with a controller, which works both plugged in and wirelessly. It also isn't loud!

  Works great now!..First few days i had one problem, it was in rest mode I thought it was actually off and I unplugged it from the wall to add an extrention box, turned it back on and it was doing a system check for errors after it said System could not start plung in dual shock with USB blah blah, did so and it wanted me to update and I did so, still same error no ps4 logo just looped in system check and system cant start... SO I ended up turning it off and doing the initialization and the whole shabam, after factory reset I finally got the logo (took me about 45 minutes of trying to fix before I gave up) reinstalled most games again... Fhew. Moral or my story is make sure you turn off th ps4 correctly and hopefully you won't have to endure what I went though. Other than that it's a ps4 that does its job!

  Let's start with the positives, the console is amazing for the price and even though I was reluctant to spend money for PlayStation plus the cost want bad at all and you actually get a deal when you buy more consecutive months. The console came in good shape and hasn't let me down in any way. The game selection is amazing but the lack of a good driving game was a little disappointing. The UI is great and easy to navigate. The themes are good although I wish they were free. The exclusives a great and always garunteed quality. Even though this console came out a while ago I think it's still worth the money. Now on to the downsides. The box it came in felt a little flimsey as it was made of cardstock and not cardboard which I would have preferred as it was being shipped. The Amazon box it came in was cardboard so that kinda makes up for it. The hard drive slot cover is very thin cheap feeling plastic and feels as if it would break easily with little effort. The controllers 3.5 mm audio jack feels like it's in an odd place and I find myself bumping the cable I have plugged in the odd time although I don't know where else Sony would put it so I don't really have a good solution. Overall however, the PS4 is a great console and well worth the money. I originally bought the console as a stand in between computers as my old one recently stopped working. I intended to sell the console when I wanted to buy the new computer but having used it for about a month I've now decided I'm going to keep it. It's won over me and I think it will win over you too.

  One of the best Amazon purchase I've ever made. I love gaming and I needed either a PS4/Xbox to get the exclusive games to either system because I only have a switch. I can say that I have absolutely no regrets buying the system. The graphics and gameplay is simply amazing!

  The console it‚Äôs self is functions perfectly‚Ä¶But the controller‚Äôs right thumbstick was showing signs of drifting to the left straight out of the box on day one.

  Great console, the graphics look great on a 4K TV even if you didn't buy the pro version. Bought this console for several exclusives I've been wanting to play for several years. Great time to buy since most of the games are now on sale.

  It‚Äôs great, but it doesn‚Äôt have Bluetooth capability, and it doesn‚Äôt have one other thing.  I didn‚Äôt realize the consoles are all different.

  The 1tb ps4 slim was the perfect combination of sleek and performance. The storage capacity kept me satisfied even after a year and a half of constant use.
