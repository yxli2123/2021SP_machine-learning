    Updated Aug 2020: Not another review of the same - this one will make you think and enjoy your Roku!
  
",5.0,Ace,"Reviewed in the United States June 13, 2018","Updated on August 4 2020
I am not shy when I say I am a fan of Roku. Early adopter, always was and still believe. Unfortunately Roku has become less appealing after July 31, 2020 - when it refused to support big stream channels HBO MAX and now Peacock - the newest kid in town from NBC.

I understand legal implications. I am an IT guy, so trust me when I say metadata drives sound monetary value. User behavior and any data we give to these and many other companies every time we use a smart device is priceless.

I adopted Roku to free myself from expensive and inflexible Cable deals. I. Me. The consumer.

I don't want to be limited on my options to watch and now I have to go to a different room to turn in my Samsung Smart TV to watch HBO Max because Roku discontinued the support of HBO. No, Roku, sorry, it was not HBO leaving Roku as you advertise it. Netflix has it's own channel. Disney+, Hulu, Univision, History Channel, you name it. There is a dedicated channel, so why not HBO? It wasn't because of client preferences, it was because of monetary reasons. Client, for the first time, has been placed in the backseat of Roku's value prop and that makes Roku the lesser because of it.

Word of advise: Roku changed the game and created a new one. The Mobile Streaming apps are now doing the same. Roku could benefit from an open approach to support any mobile streaming app, just like a cell phone does today - to keep ahead of the game. Casting your phone to the screen is an alternative and may become the BEST choice if consumers are left with no choice than to keep freedom power in their handhelds because streaming devices like this one want to limit customers. My two cents. My review stands with some minor mods because I can no longer say Roku plays it all...

Thanks for all those helpful votes!

Original Review follows.....

There are hundreds of reviews for this product, so rather than touching on what has already been said, let me just throw in some Do's and Don'ts if you find yourself, like me, navigating the vast array of options in the streaming space.

Do's
1) Do your research! There are several different models for Roku, depending on what YOU really need, want or want to pay. I bought a Roku Express because I was upgrading from a 1st generation Roku device and this one is (or at least feels) a thousand times faster, more powerful and has the upgraded software interfaces for apps like Netflix where you can manage your profiles - the older versions did not support that ability, it only presented your default profile.
2) Use the power adapter that comes with it. Sure, you can plug it to your smartTV usb port for power, but if you read about this, there are tons of issues that stem from lack of power supply to the device.
3) Think where you will place your device. This is NOT a set top box, this is a tiny (half of your hand palm) device that has a double tape and sticks do your TV. It is not invasive, it has nice black finish so it won't ruin any aesthetics, but once you stick it on, you need to leave it there, otherwise you could end up with a tape that will no longer work, creating an extra hassle - think location first, then execute and paste it.
4) Play around with it - it has lots of configuration options, like turning on your TV with 1 touch, casting your mobile screen, etc. If you go only by the default options you might miss some fun tricks!
5) Match it with a good router/wifi setup. The worst you can do is have a nice TV, get the top of the line 4K enabled Roku and pair that to a sub-par WIFI connection or a provider that will not support your streaming needs. Remember! this is not plugged by cables, this device streams over the air radio waves, so the distance to your router, obstacles, speed of your network (not only download speeds, but actual WIFI band speeds) can all affect the outcome, so do your homework and think about your entertainment system as a whole, not just the TV / streaming portion.

Dont's
1) Not everybody needs 4K streaming and NOT all providers support it! Many providers will charge premium for UHD Content and offer HD as standard option, if that is the case for you, spending extra $$ on a 4K TV and a 4K streaming device will be wasted. (again, see my last DO bullet item!)
2) Let your expectations be unrealistic - Yes Roku provides tons of free content. Free means many of the channels are privately supported which means the content may not be UHD.
3) The REAL Fun from roku comes when you enable the channels based on your paid content (netflix, hulu, amazon, premium networks like hbo, nfl, etc...) so if you want to really exploit your Roku's capabilities you will have to pay at some point for prime content.

I hope this helps - I am an early adopter of Roku, have major streaming services like Netflix, Prime and supplemented with an ""a la carte"" cable service like sling, spectrum choice, DirectTV now or any of your preferred providers and this will unlock all the major broadcast networks, plus some other channels. - EXCEPT HBO MAX & NBC's Peacock.

One last thought: The interest thing is that Roku has a channel for many of these major network stations and watching their content through the Roku channel as opposed through the cable provider app, I've found that there is more content outside, and better choices for on-demand.

Hope you like my review!",

    What you really need to know...

  Fantastic product so far!  After the first week, we bought a second one for a family member.First thing:  Before you buy, understand what content is free and what is not.  Second, in case it's not obvious, the Roku operates over your wifi and internet connection.  You have to have an internet connection that is fast enough to stream video.  If you can't stream video on your mobile (via wifi) or PC, you won't be able to stream it on the Roku either.Subscription content: Anything that you have to pay for elsewhere (like Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, network TV streaming, etc), you'll still have to have those same subscriptions.  But the Roku allows you to access all of those subscriptions (the ones you're paying for) from a single device on your TV, with a nice interface that nearly anyone can use, even if they're technology-illiterate.  Worst case, if you get lost somewhere, just press the Home button.  (But keep in mind, each 'channel' on Roku is an app written by the individual content provider, so some are a little more complicated than others.  I suspect for marketing reasons, it's not always obvious on some of the network TV channels which content is free versus paid until you try to play it.  But you'll always be prompted before paying for anything, and you can add a pin-number to prevent accidental purchases).Ad-supported content: There is a lot of ad-supported content, just like watching free over-the-air (OTA) TV stations.  For network TV (ABC, NBC, CBS, CW, etc), check each network's website to see what shows you can watch for free directly on their website, and that's generally what you'll be able to watch on Roku, too.  After all, the 'channels' on Roku are apps written by each network.  For many networks, the free content includes the last 3 to 5 episodes of things that are currently airing, with content being made available a week after the original broadcast date.  This is comes in handy if you miss an episode or two of over-the-air TV.  Some of the networks also offer free 'throwback' content, where you can watch an entire series of an older show.  And there are a few channels like pluto.tv and tubi.tv that provide a wide assortment of ad-supported movies and TV shows.  Again, check their corresponding websites to see what content they currently have, and that's what you'll get on Roku.  The ones mentioned above offer some relatively recent content, in addition to a lot of older and slightly-older content.Free, without ads:  Mostly, you'll find that the ad-free content is extremely old...  lots of black-and-white TV and movies, some early color TV/movies, etc.  For those who don't like much of what's on TV these days, there's a lot of classy and classic stuff here.  And, of course, a lot of b- and c-grade stuff you've never heard of.This newest version of the Roku Express (""5X more powerful"") has a very smooth interface, with good response from the remote.  Video startup is extremely fast if you have decent internet speed.  I tested on a relative's 6mbps DSL internet, and buffering times were never uncomfortable.  On my faster internet (100mbps), videos either start instantly, or take no more than about 1 or 2 seconds of buffering.The remote control is great -- simple, strong signal, good range.  It's infrared-based, so you have to be in the same room (why would you want to be out of the room??).  I generally don't even have to point the remote at the Roku box, because the infrared is strong enough to reflect off of the ceiling or walls and still work.  Just be sure your Roku box's front side is unobscured and pointing toward the room.  They provide a sticky-tape strip to stick the box somewhere convenient, like the side or top of your TV or media cabinet.  The provided HDMI cable is only 2 feet long, though, so it does have to be relatively close to the TV.  But you could use a different HDMI cable if you need the remote to be a little farther away.  One feature I love about the remote is that pressing the Home button will turn on your TV and switch to the Roku's HDMI input, assuming your TV supports this (I have a Samsung TV which is supported, and a TCL TV which apparently wasn't).You can also use the Roku app on your mobile to control the Roku via wifi.  In addition to providing an interface that looks pretty similar to the physical remote, you can also browse for other content while something is already playing.  It fact, it's quite a bit easier to navigate if you're searching for something specific, since the physical remote requires using an on-screen keyboard where you select each letter and click OK (normally, I'm not searching for something specific on the physical remote, so it's not a problem).  The app also has a headphone feature, which I'm guessing allows you to listen directly from your mobile instead of via the TV... great for watching at night when others are sleeping.  Note, the Roku app is NOT designed to watch Roku content directly on your mobile.  It simply lets you select the content to watch on the TV.Overall, it's a great experience.  My only subscription at the moment is Amazon prime, which doesn't have a lot of content that I really want to watch (sorry, Amazon!  I have Prime mostly for the shipping), so I use the Roku mostly for ad-supported TV and movies, and there's more than enough to keep me busy for a long time.

    Roku Channel shows hundreds of free movies & Locast has free ABC/FOX/NBC/CBS
  
",5.0,modalsystem,"Reviewed in the United States October 11, 2017","I have used Roku for years,including several different models.The best new thing of note is Roku has recently released The Roku Channel,which has hundreds of free movies.It is ad supported.And now Locast.org app gives you free local broadcast stations CBS,NBC,FOX,ABC and PBS.Locast now offers local TV network broadcasts for New York,Boston,Chicago,Houston,Dallas,Denver areas and plans to add many more cities.This means many folks will no longer need antennas to watch local networks for free. Roku has just about every app you can imagine (YouTube/Pandora/Netflix/Amazon/Hulu/HBO Now) plus tons of more apps in many different categories.Roku Express works fine,but you need to point the remote at the device,unlike other Roku models.Here are some points to consider when deciding on which model of Roku to buy:

1)If you need to connect by WiFi in a room far away from your WiFi router,I would recommend the Roku Streaming Stick PLUS or Roku Ultra.

2)If you have a 4K TV,I would recommend the Roku Ultra or Roku Streaming Stick PLUS.The Premiere 2018 model also plays 4K.

3)To search for content using your voice,go with either the Streaming Stick,Streaming Stick PLUS or Ultra.All 3 of these models also have a remote that can control the power and volume on your TV.
There is also a Roku app for Android & iPhone/iPad that lets you use your smartphone/tablet to control any Roku device and use your phone/tablet on-screen keyboard or voice for searches.

4)If you want a wired ethernet connection,go with the Roku Ultra.

5)If you want to connect to an old TV with RCA/Composite audio/video jacks,you will need the Express PLUS

6)The Express and Premiere 2018 models have a remote where it has to be pointed at the device,unlike the other Roku models.

7)If you are only going to buy one Roku device,I would recommend the Roku Ultra.The Ultra has many unique features that the other Roku models don't such as:
-Gaming buttons to play video games
-Remote finder to find a lost remote control
-Ethernet port for a wired connection
-Micro SD card slot
-USB Port
-Night listening mode (this lowers the volume of loud,explosive sounds and raises the volume of soft sounds like whispers.Very useful!!)
-Headphone jack on the remote for listening without disturbing others

For those who have not used a Roku before,here are some tips that might be helpful:

1)There is no monthly fee to use a Roku.There are many free channels/apps with free movies,music and TV programs and some people use Roku only for the free channels and do not pay any fees.

You do NOT have to enter credit card info if you only wish to view free content and you can always add credit card info to your account later for paid channels/apps.If you plan on viewing free content only,I suggest setting up a Roku account before you activate the device.When you reach the page to enter credit card info,some browsers will show a ""Skip,I'll add later"" option at the bottom.If you do not see this option,simply log out of your account,then log back in.You may have to then enter a different activation code for your device if you skip entering credit card info during device set up,but you do NOT have to enter credit card info if you only want to view free content.

2)Some of the most popular free channels/apps are: YouTube,Pandora radio,The Roku Channel,Pluto TV,Tubi TV,Crackle,CBS News,NBC News,ABC,PBS, PBS KIds and many more.You can also find a free live stream of FOX News on YouTube by searching ""Fox News Live"" on YouTube.

3)Some of the most popular paid channels/apps are Netflix,Hulu,Amazon video,HBO Now,Vudu,Sling TV,Spectrum TV and Direct TV Now.

4)If you are looking for a bundle of channels of live TV to replace cable TV,check out Sling TV,YouTube TV,Spectrum TV,Direct TV Now,Hulu,Pluto TV and Playstation Vue.All of these are paid services except for Pluto TV,which is free.

5)To find and add new channels on Roku,just press the Home button on the remote control,scroll down and select ""Streaming Channels"".There you will find thousands of channels/apps in many different categories and many of them are free.

My one gripe about Roku (and other streaming devices) is the lack of a fully functional web browser and I hope Roku will include web browsing on models in the near future.I have been surfing the web on the big screen for years and find it ridiculous when an internet connected TV device does not allow you to surf the internet and forces one to switch to yet another internet connected device to do so.
I am aware of screen mirroring function from smartphone/PC/tablet but find that a poor excuse to not include a web browser.Many people who type a lot of messages and/or emails like myself prefer typing on a wireless keyboard rather than a phone/tablet/remote control.

Bottom Line:You can now get a Roku device to replace your cable TV box & service or to replace an antenna for free local network TV.And of course you can create your own custom TV experience that simply is not possible with cable or antenna TV.",

    Runs hot, no off switch, constant HDCP errors
  
",3.0,My Eyes Are Up Here!,"Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2018","









  
  
    
  I like the product and enjoy streaming lots of free TV and movies- that I have no problems with.But the product has a few issues.  The first is that every time I want to use it, it gives me an HDCP error.  The screen shows me the fix (unplug the HDMI cable and plug it back in).  But why?  How come every time I want to use the unit I have to get up and unplug it and plug it back in?  There is an alternate work-around I found on the internet, I can reboot the device, but that actually takes longer than walking across the room and unplugging / plugging it back in.  Alternatively, I can fix the problem by unplugging the power to the unit and plugging it back in, but that only works until the next time I turn the TV on.I had to look up what the HDCP error means, it's a form of digital copy protection.  My LG TV isn't trying to copy anything, nor does it have the capability.Of course, if the unit had an on/off switch, I could use that to fix the above error, but it doesn't which leads to my next problem, it wastes electricity 24/7 doing nothing.  Why?  What data is it sending to the Roku servers when my TV is off?  I don't get it.The unit is warm all the time while it wastes electricity.  Our electricity is about 40 cents per KWH, so this Roku will cost me a little over $9/year in electricity costs because it doesn't have an off button.  So I'm unplugging it when I'm not using it.  So long as I turn the TV on before I plug it back in, this strategy also fixes the HDCP error.If it wasn't for the bogus copy protection error, the running warm and wasting electricity, this would be a 5-star product.UPDATE:  I found a solution to the problems.  I got a green power strip/surge protector.  If you are unfamiliar with them, they are used for cutting parasitic electrical loads.  The strip senses when the TV is turned off and then kills the power to all the other devices that only normally run when the TV is on.

    Why ever pay for cable!!!
  
",5.0,Alissa,"Reviewed in the United States February 12, 2018","









  
  
    
  I have been paing $170 for cable and internet for years (its now $50 with just internet, so about $120 on cable). I didn't have any special channels...no HBO, SHOtime....anything. Not even top tier cable. I had the middle package and it cost me an arm and a leg. I decided to cancel my cable long before I even bought the Roku. I only bought it when the Superbowl rolled around and I needed to make sure I could watch it. This thing is amazing. You pay the $30 for the device and THAT'S IT. No subscription fees, no hidden taxes, nothing! You can chose to add hulu, netflix or HBO if you wanted to pay a subscription through them, or do what I do and just use my sisters. :) It has turned my old TV into a smart TV. Best purchase ever. Buy this and ditch cable. You honestly won't be disappointed.

    WARNING: ROKU DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS DEVICE
  
",1.0,Molly,"Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2018","









  
  
    
  I was a big Roku fan, and owned two prior to this purchase.  Bought it to replace a Roku that literally burned out.  No problems with activation until we reached the step on Roku's web site which involves ""syncing"".  The screen just hung for HOURS.  Tried multiple times on different days.  Tried the online help - no help there.  Tried calling the support number, and was told that THIS DEVICE DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR ROKU SUPPORT.  This was a Roku problem on their website, but the company refused to help resolve it.Thankfully the good folks at Amazon allowed us to return it, and we bought an Amazon Fire Stick instead.I WILL NEVER AGAIN BUY A ROKU PRODUCT.  If a company refuses to support a product within 10 days of purchase, I'll buy elsewhere.This should have been an easy setup, and the issue lay entirely with Roku's ""sync"" step.  I have a theory that their software couldn't cope with the fact that one of our Roku devices couldn't be found because it had literally fried.The Amazon device setup was a snap.  Farewell, Roku.

    Quick and snappy and overall a win! Also, important PSA in bottom of review!

  spent a ton of time reading the reviews comparing all the streaming devices. I have an older model apple tv and I wanted an additional streaming device for my bedroom TV. I got a relative the firestick and tried it out myself - didn't really love the interface so ultimately decided to give the Roku Express a shot. Initially I thought I was downgrading by getting the Roku Express since it's so much cheaper than an Apple TV. So not a downgrade!! This device is lightning fast. I like it so much better that I use it as my main device now and moved the other one to my bedroom. I didn't realize how fast a streaming player was capable of being till now. There are some other things I noticed compared to my other device. I'll break down the pros and cons into a list.Pros: 1) So far (it's been about 2 weeks), it has never restarted or froze. My Apple TV froze/restarted frequently. 2) The remote is fine - I read some reviews where people said that the remote didn't communicate well if not close enough/exactly pointed to the receiver. I didn't have this issue unless the remote was physically blocked by something (think of your cable box remote as to how this remote functions). 3) As mentioned above, this thing is lightning fast. It responds so quickly - quicker than my fios!Cons: 1) The interface - didn't love it. For instance My List for netflix - the visuals of being able to see all the shows on your list are just not the best user experience. It's messy, overly large icons, and not viewable on one screen. Edit: You can now hit the left button on Roku remote and it takes you to some shortcuts, such as My List  2) There is no way to turn this device off. I periodically touch the receiver to see if it's hot when not in use and indeed it's warm - which means that it's always running in background. I really don't like this.*Lastly, just a PSA for all those people that scared the *&$% out of me about there being some sort of tech support/setup fee: People - you have got to stop putting that in your reviews. There is no fee to set up your Roku or get regular customer support. What you probably did is google roku support and get a scam site that is not affiliated with Roku. There are several articles on this scam  but since I can't post any links, I suggest you google ""roku tech support scam"" and you will see what I'm talking about.

    Roku Express is better, powerful, versatile and cheaper than Apple TV
  
",5.0,ruel,"Reviewed in the United States May 6, 2018","









  
  
    
  bought this Roku Express for a little under thirty bucks here on amazon. it's to replace an Apple TV 3rd Generation which is to now to go to my sister. the Apple TV is still good, but wanted something more powerful & versatile. and the Roku Express is all that and more. see my attached picture comparing the Roku Express with my old Apple TV:  do NOT let the puny size of the little Roku Express device box dissuade and fool you. the Roku Express is one powerful device. personally very happy with Roku. it's like no turning back to apple.happily watching Hulu, Amazon Prime Video, CBS All Access, ESPN (with the new ESPN+ which could NOT get on my old Apple TV's WatchESPN channel), HBO, and other channels like TheCW (which could NOT get on the old Apple TV), and Pluto TV (which has its own free tv lineup of channels including free movie channels, and some popular cable tv news channels), Crackle, the Roku TV channel, and news channels like CBSN, NBC News, ABC News, and NewsON (for news from your local tv station), and the CBS Sports HQ channel (the new digital sports headline news channel from CBS). there are more channels to select, but those are most of the channels in my lineup on my roku. very versatile and more robust than on my old apple tv.also, a must-have channel is YouTube which looks better as laid out on roku when compared to the simplier youtube version on appletv. and having YouTube on roku makes roku the definite better buy for your money if you are also considering the amazon fire tv stick. get the roku if you want youtube because google is blocking youtube on the amazon fire tv. in other words, roku has youtube, but amazon fire tv does not.a couple things with the roku could be considered cons but which you can fortunately work around: (1) you cannot turn the roku off because it will just go to sleep and have a screensaver that is always on -- solution is to plug the USB for power into the usb input on your TV and when you turn off the TV then the roku will also go off, or you can plug the power for the roku into a powerstrip that you can power off whenever you want; and (2) when you register the roku for the first time, you have to put in your payment information like for a credit card or paypal -- but the solution if you don't like that is you can remove that payment option later by going into your roku online account using a web browser.very happy with this Roku Express. it's now like goodbye to Apple TV. and hello forever to Roku.

    Works Great but it has Heat Issues
  
",4.0,texan_176@yahoo.com,"Reviewed in the United States December 17, 2017","









  
  
    
  I bought this streaming device based on using this identical model in a hotel I stayed in earlier this year.  The simplicity and good performance were the major factors that influenced my decision to go with it.  Full disclosure; I have cable internet at 70+ Mbps at home so slower data speeds could significantly reduce the performance.  In my case, 3+ hour movies on Netflix or Amazon will load and start to play within 8-10 seconds max.  I can also fast forward and rewind with incredible speed; nearly no buffering.  Setup and use is very easy.  Things have come a long way from the first Roku streaming device that came about about 10 years ago.  I purchased the original model back then and ran it on DSL based internet; it was an amazing device for the time; it looked like DVD quality on a CRT screen.  This Express one looks great on my 1080p screen; nearly a Blu Ray level of resolution.So why not give it 5 stars?Only about 10 days into using it I saw a warming on my screen indicating the device was overheating.  This was after about 3-4 hours of use in a room at 72 degree.  I did not place anything on top of the Express or put it on top of a heat insulating material like wool.  I stopped using it and unplugged it immediately. Just to see how hot it got I unplugged the HDHI cable and found the tip of the cable that goes into the Express was scalding hot.  After it cooled down it worked just fine and continues to do so. However, it is kind of disappointing this thing is not engineered to properly dispose of the heat it generates or not generate so much heat to begin with.  Instead they designed a sensor in it to warn the user.  The original Roku streaming box had vents on the top and never once overheated in the several years it was in use.  As I recall the old box was around $100 while the Express is under 1/3 of that price.  So, ignoring inflation, the Express could break twice and you could buy it three times over to end up the same as buying the old one 10 years ago.I would say buy it if you plan light use.  For someone who is constantly streaming several hours a day this might not be the best choice.

    Beware of Roku

  After 2 months my Roku was unable to receive the WIFI bandwidth necessary to watch any programming. All I received was a ""circle""  as I waited to connect,to no avail. Thinking it was my modem, I had my internet service provider come to my home only to be informed that the Roku device could not receive the signal. This is after my old router and modem was upgraded. All that was accomplished with this upgrade was that  the strength of the connection went from one bar to two out of five. I can only suggest one do more research then I did.

  Pay the $3 more for a new Roku Express if you’re going to buy one at all. The two refurbished units I purchased have a hard time sensing the WiFi signal even when they are right beside the wireless router. The units respond faster than the Roku 2 units I had previously, when navigating...but any upgrade should, I would expect. I also expected faster streaming...not the case with the Roku Express, which claims to be 5x faster.UPDATE: BOTH OF THE ROKU EXPRESS UNITS I PURCHASED KEEP CRASHING. I HAVE TO RESET AND RE-ENTER ALL OF MY LOGIN AND CREDENTIAL INFO AND RE-INSTALL ALL OF MY APPS EVERYTIME I WANT TO WATCH ONE OF THESE. CHANGING MY RATING TO 1 STAR.

  I received this roku on December 4th. It has worked well for the last 3 months, but now it's junk. It says that the power cord isn't supplying enough power and to use the one provided. However, it it's the power cord that it came with! I've tried moving outlets and unplugging it and plugging it back in. On occasion it will power on, but when it does it isn't recognizing ANY wireless networks. There are no issues with our network, and our other roku is working just fine.

  Love it. It’s so small. It comes with sticky tape to attach it wherever you want. I put mine on the bottom of my TV. This is also simple to hook up, simple to set up and simple to use. I’m using the usb to power it off of the TV instead of plugging it into the wall. It’s much faster than I expected. I’ll be buying a couple more for the other TVs. I’m very pleased with this.

  I am not one to write negative review like this, but it this case, I have no other way to express my frustration with this product.The product updated its firmware, (which btw, I never agreed to) and since then rendered itself unusable.9 times out of 10, it would start with low power message, even though nothing in my setup has changed, and even though it is using the power supply provided with the device.in the off chance case it would start, it won't connect to the network and would report weird stuff like a MAC address that is all zeros.The device updated itself and started doing that just after (by two days) the 30 days return period has expired.Roku's customer support is a bunch of pages with troubleshooting instructions. after 30 min of surfing their web I couldn't find a way to contact them and wait for them to get back to me with an attempt to solve the issue.this thing is under $30, so not the end of the world. I say screw it. I am throwing this piece of junk in the garbage where it belongs and going to try and get one of the services that actually know what they are doing, like google chromecast or amazon fire.

    AWESOME to use with TWC/Spectrum App (replaced Spectrum digital converter boxes)
  
",5.0,KBS,"Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2017","









  
  
    
  Purchased four to replace the Spectrum digital converter boxes on our miscellaneous TVs and it works great with the Spectrum app - if you don't mind the extra step of clicking on the app to watch TV.  Added bonus of expanded channel tier beyond the basic tier you pay for which the Spectrum box limits (not to mention all the other apps like Netflix) so you can watch ALL the spectrum channels you pay for.  There is also a TV guide built in. I returned the digital boxes to Spectrum and keeping my $16 a month rental fee. My husband says set up was very easy, just follow the prompts and it only took a couple minutes. Great deal!

  I don't have a 4k tv and I don't have the need for voice commands, so when I was looking for a streaming device I chose this Roku player because it had the features that I needed and the price was way better compared to Amazon stick (even though I love Amazon products). The installation was fast in both the computer and tv. The receiver is a little big compared to the fire stick but its still small enough. It comes with an HDMI cable, which in my case, the small size is perfect, and the USB cable and power adapter to power it. My receiver is powered just by the USB cable in the back on my tv. The picture quality is 1080p and the internet speed is fast enough to prevent lagging while streaming.

  I bought a Roku which says 5x model as per your suggestion butI just hate it. It takes for ever to pause, rewind or forward.You have to click 3 to 10 times pause/play button to pause or play.Rewind and Forward are even worse since they just failed to acton for more than 10 times.Changing channels is challenging! Keep pressing over and over and overand may be it will succeed!Switching between Live, Home and Library is impossible.Most of the time you have to click 10 times to switch Live to Library.I am surprised YouTube TV customers haven't complained about thisfrustrating experience with using YouTube TV App on Roku!!5X is not enough.. it needs at least 50x really to make some sense out of it....

    Great Alternative to Cable TV
  
",5.0,in the Berkshires,"Reviewed in the United States April 27, 2018","









  
  
    
  I was searching for an alternative to the local cable company and decided to give Roku a try. It was an inexpensive investment, so why not?  It was easy to install and didn't take much time to set up (though I recommend starting subscriptions to services like Sling or Netflix from a computer to make things go faster since typing letter by letter on the on-screen interface is tedious for more than entering a user name and password). I liked my Roku so much that I purchased a second one to use on my old, non-digital tv. That works well and I can begin watching a program on one television, stop when I want to, then start up again where I left off on either tv. Oh, and the Roku ""box"" is about the size of a pack of chewing gum - a big saving of space over the box required by the cable company (and no monthly fee for the Roku device, just the one time purchase price). As for savings, I now spend a little over half each month for Internet, Sling and other channel subscriptions as I spent for cable tv and Internet through the cable company.

    Easy to set up, small size, great remote, excellent app support, and lots of free stuff!
  
",5.0,Robert Griffith,"Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2018","









  
  
    
  A friend of mine had been suggesting Roku for a while.  I never thought much about it, but purchased one and then never bothered hooking it up to the TV.  I didn't really think I needed it.  But then life happened and I ended up living alone without the funds to afford cable/satellite.  I picked up the Roku Express from Amazon to give it another shot -- and I was impressed.  First off, the Roku Channel (TV comes in apps called Channels)  has lots of free movies and TV shows to watch.  Then you jump in and download new free channels for things like horror movies, 70s TV, sci-fi, crafts, home improvement, etc.  There are even live news channels, some local TV (depending on where you live), etc.  Well worth the cost of buying ONE DVD.  I love my Roku.  The only reason I would get rid of this one is if I bought one of the higher end models with more features.  I actually find myself spending my time on this instead of Netflix -- and there's no monthly payments.

  It was delightful until it stopped recognizing the wireless network after about a month.

  We have the Firestick and Roku Express. Both are two completely different things that have similar features. We prefer Roku because it seems to be more convenient for us. If you have roku tvs and like the interface, the roku express has the exact same interface and screensavers which is good. Overall, its nice to have both, we just prefer the roku more in our house because of its simple design and interface, great selection of apps and channels, and powerful wifi.

",2.0,caspermac,"Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2019","









  
  
    
  The roku unit we received has been defective from day one. We blamed our internet provider. They came out three diffrenet times to test the signal at our house to find out why we were constantly buffering, errorimg out, or just unable to connect. The first two times they could mot find a problem with our service( the highest available speed). The third time they changed out all of our equipment and gave us a booster. Nothing changed because all along it has been our roku express. It has been defective all along, and I blamed it on my internet provider. By the time I figured it out, I was past the return time frame, and the call support. It has been an exceptionally frustrating experience, and I am extremely upset that we got a defective unit. If this had worked as it was supposed to, it would be a great device. Our picture is often pixelated. The shows will stop randomly and error out. We often get measages that it is taking longer than expected to connect. The commercials will randomly be placed in the middle of a scene instead of at commercial breaks. Commercials are very grainy and pixelated. Sometimes it will sit and think, and think, and think, all the while flashing scenes of the next segment for a fraction of a second.  I threw $30 out the window, and what I got in return was endless frustration and stress. Very disappointing experience over the last 4 months.

    I Like This Roku Product----but Roku Customer Support is a Nightmare
  
",2.0,Mike,"Reviewed in the United States August 20, 2018","









  
  
    
  I actually purchased two of these Roku Express devices from Amazon in March 2018.  One continues to work great, but just recently, the other one would not connect properly to my WiFi network and when it did connect, the internet speed was extremely slow to the point where the television picture quality was awful.  I spent two days troubleshooting the problem with no success and finally determined that the Roku device was faulty.  I resorted to contacting Roku Customer Support for a replacement device since my original purchase was outside the Amazon 30-day return window.  (Note that the Roku warranty is one year on this product.)After several frustrating back-and-forth emails with Roku Customer Support, the Roku representative told me to contact my Internet Service Provider (ISP) to solve the problem.  Really????  Instead of doing that, I went straight to Walmart and purchased a brand new Roku Express device.  I hooked it up, linked it and it is working great.  Unfortunately, I'm now stuck with a faulty, $30 Roku Express device that is covered under Roku's one-year warranty, but Roku Customer Support would not authorize the return for a replacement.If the Roku device that you purchase works, that's great.  If you have to contact Roku Customer Support, prepare for some serious frustration.UPDATE:  Roku Customer Support finally contacted me a few days later via e-mail and said they would replace my defective Roku Express device.  A Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) number was provided so I packaged it up and sent it to Roku via USPS at my own expense.  I haven't received the replacement yet, but I'm hopeful that it will be a NEW device as opposed to a refurbished unit.  If nothing else, at least I'll have a spare if one of my other devices has issues in the future.  Still, I'm not a fan of Roku Customer Support.UPDATE 2:  I finally received a brand new Roku Express device from Roku Customer Support to replace my defective unit.  It took a total of 10 days from the day I mailed my defective unit to the day that I received my new one.

Second, you can’t access anything without creating an account. Ok. I start to set one up and it requires a credit card on file. No. I only use Netflix and Hulu. They already have my billing info. Roku company does not need to store my cc number. So I try and call customer service. That’s just as annoying as the voice on the device. It keeps telling me to look online. I just want to chat with a human being for help. If I can’t even talk to a real person why would I give my cc to them? When I kept trying other options it would hang up on me. After 3 attempts I decided to send it back. I am not putting a cc number in their hands for the off chance I may want to watch a movie. Screw that. If it’s not available on the apps I pay for, I won’t watch it. Very disappointed that you can’t even talk to someone to try and bypass. Already packed up and ready to send back.

  I was fed up with my Sony Blu-ray player freezing, failing to connect to the Internet, overall slowness, and now it doesn't play YouTube which I like to connect to my phone for videos that I have queued up. Like others that have reviewed this, the Roku is amazing and solves all of those problems. Comes with Netflix, Amazon, YouTube, and a very pleasant surprise is the NHL channel. They must have negotiated a deal because that channel is amazing for the playoffs right now. Video recaps is want I am most interested in, and it's easy to get to them.  The menu is organized by teams, scores, and the playoff shows a team bracket with scores and the series count. Pretty amazing . The whole bracket is clickable and you find out information about the game, leaders, statistics, and video highlights with a 5 to 7 minutes recap, which are perfect.  These are on YouTube/NHL but Roku has them better organized and WITHOUT Ads.The Roku is on all the time because it draws very little power . Therefore it's always instant on.  Each channel is extremely quick to load. Set up with you channels with the TV menu or using the Roku app on your phone. Very modern and very nice. Thank you thank you very much!

  We've had a Fire TV Stick for a couple years now, and this beats it hands down. I made the switch to Roku for a couple of reasons, and have no regrets whatsoever.1. The FTVS always runs slow (not because it's old: it's been that was since we got it) because of all the crap Amazon is trying to run in the background. Roku so far has no delays at all, other than the normal time to load data from the various web services.2. Because of Amazon and Google's ongoing feud, FTV no longer supports YouTube (which includes YouTubeTV) or casting from YouTube. Roku has no dog in that fight, so it happily runs Google services and Amazon services side by side with no complaint.

  If you have Comcast's Xfinity Stream (which I believe is only in certain markets) this Roku will allow you to download the Xfinity Stream app. You can only download the Xfinity app on a Roku according to Comcast. Not sure if this will change?  My older Roku would not allow me to download the Xfinity Stream app so not sure which models will or won't work but I know this one does.The Xfinity Stream app is in Beta but works very well and replaces your cable box. The biggest of advantage of running your ""cable"" through the internet is that you can connect 'cable' to all of your portable devices (phone, Ipad etc) and you can connect to all of your TV's but you will need a Roku for each TV to do so. This one works....bought two!

  I've been struggling for literally years now trying to get my Sony BDPS3200 Blu-ray Disc Player to stream Netflix, but it almost always choked, sputtered, and came to a grinding halt.  I tried everything, new modem, new router, clearing cache, etc. etc.  You probably know what I'm talking about.  I was considering upgrading the disc player, but wasn't really keen on spending the money when the disc player I have works fine for discs.  I finally decided to go this route.  Awesome!! Roku plays it all, and for only $30 bucks, I have zero reason to complain, since I'm now have zero technical problems with streaming content.  Yay!!!  I should add here that my older-model CRT-type HD TV only has a single HDMI input, so the Roku is hooked up to an HDMI 3-way spllitter. This allows me ro run the Roku box, my disc player, and occasionally hook my camera up without having to plug and unplug cables.  I use a wireless router to get the broadband signal from modem to Roku box.

  LOVE LOVE LOVE THIS THING!!! I had purchased a streaming media box (also from Amazon) last spring when we decided to unplug from cable. But it gave us no end of troubles. First, it came with an old version of Kody, which did us no good. Second, it would constantly spool (that irritating circle in the middle of the screen while it's trying to download info) at the WORST times and we'd miss something important. And third, the remote was simply terrible, needing multiple clicks to get it to register, simply going crazy and doing what it wanted... finally, we decided enough was enough.A good friend had  been recommending Roku for years, so that's what I was shopping around for. But when I saw the price for this stick, I thought ""NO WAY!!!"". After watching a review vid, I figured I'd give it a try. And both the hubby and myself were simply amazed! It took me exactly 7 minutes to not only hook it up and get the latest updates downloaded, but to also go through the HUGE list of available programs to use with our new Roku! It's already set up with Sling (which is our basic TV package now), and with Netflix (for movies and power watching shows), both of which are also programed into the remote, so a one touch tuner! And to add YouTube, Prime Video, news stations (LOCAL even! Wow, didn't have that with the old media box!), my Pandora, along with Iheartradio and a few others in just 7 minutes when I'm no computer/android pro? PRICELESS!!!The remote is easy to use, and also comes pre-programed with Hulu and CW, and does EVERYTHING with just one tap! lol Finding our way around the interface is so simple, completely intuitive (a VERY good thing in my book!), and it's broadcast in HD! I was told the streaming box was also HD... but once I hooked up Roju Express and turned on the first show it was obvious that that was NOT the case! So it's great to have our HD back again!I'm extremely pleased with this purchase, and would definitely recommend it to my family and friends.

  I have had this roku device for 9 months and so far loved it...until it stopped working.The device randomly started giving me a ""low power"" warning that my TV USB didn't have enough power for the device...only I wasn't using my TV's usb, the Roku is using it's own power supply to an outlet. It also suddenly can't find any wireless networks even though its very close to the router and all other devices can.But that's where it gets difficult. The number listed in the Amazon support for the device only allows phone support for Roku streaming sticks or Roku TVs, not the Roku Express. It refers you to the forums and online articles.I finally got some chat help and the responses are literally 3-5 minutes apart and ignore my comments like troubleshooting steps I have already completed. Total bot.UPDATE: After leaving me hanging for up to 5 minutes at a time, the agent asked me to connect the device to another TV while I was doing so, he disconnected the chat since I hadn't typed in 2 minutes. I am not back to 8th in the queue to speak to an agent and over an hour into what should have been a simple issue. WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE.I've spent way too long on this already so it looks like I'm going back to the FireStick. Which is a shame, I liked this device and user experience MUCH better.

  A few issues with the Hulu channel during setup but after that was fixed it works great! Also use it for Amazon Video & YouTube. A great way to convert a basic TV into a smart TV. Seems to run a bit hot for such a small device. Probably because of the lack of heat vents on the device.It came with a remote & two Durracell AAA batteries which is better than some off brand batteries most remotes include. Also came with some double sided tape to stick it firmly to ether your TV or TV stand. I stick it to my TV stand as far away from the heat vents on the TV as possible to prevent overheating of the roku device.The HDMI included was pretty short so I ended up using a spare 6 foot HDMI cable I had. It also uses a Micro USB port & USB power adapter for the power cable which I guess is good so the cable is easily replaceable if ever damaged. Over all its a pretty decent device & a much cheaper alternative to the overpriced Apple TV.

  What a waste, do not buy this. Do not.First when setting it up on the TV I found out that my older TV has a standard definition and a high-definition HDMI. After setting it up on the high definition I wanted to switch it to the standard definition so my Blu-ray could be on the high definition. The device would come up that you switch to HDMI and to put it back. If you did not do this and hit any button on the remote, it would change your TV back to the original HDMI Channel. I tried hitting the reset on the button that did not work I called the 1-800 number, they could not help me. And no, the 1-800 number helpline has people from not in the United States.The next big frustrating thing. When you register it online which you have to do, you have to put in all your demographics no matter what and then you have to put in a credit card. You have no option other than put in a credit card. But hey at least reminds you that most of the services are free.On a positive note, the device itself is actually pretty sturdy. When you put it on the floor to stomp on it it will not break.I consider myself tech-savvy but this device beat me. I do not give out my credit card information this is not up for discussion this is not negotiable. When you're a computer device you work for me and if I want you in a different HDMI input then that's where you're going to go. Now I get to spend money on a fire stick.Please, please do not buy this product. I wish I didn't. I used it for an hour and hated every minute of it. Plus it gets ridiculously hot. When I took it off my TV which the sticky tape is very sticky, it was very hot.

I was already an Amazon Prime subscriber and could get all the TV shows and movies I wanted for free, so why was I paying for 150 channels I never watched?  And most of what the cable company billed me for was monthly rental fees for equipment I had paid for multiple times over.  The Roku sticks were easy to install and connect to Prime. I will warn you though, once I had all the cable boxes unhooked and packed away it suddenly dawned on my that wasn't a single clock in my house except for the one at my bedside.

  We ordered this Roku because we have a Roku tv and are happy with it.  We totally regret that decision and should have went with a Firestick!  When we went to set up the Roku, we had to call a customer service number.  They told us since we already have a Roku we had to upgrade to ""premium""  (a paid subscription) to ""support having two in the house."".Of course we told them there was no way we were paying for additional streaming services as we only watch Netlix, Amazon and Hulu on it and already pay to subscribe to those.  The customer service person got very rude that we would not order additional services and actually HUNG UP ON US. So instead of just plugging this thing in and watching tv, we wasted tons of time with customer service, got treated poorly and then had to search the internet for hacks on how to set this up without going through customer service and giving them a credit card which we feared they would put bogus charges on.  If you do order this product DO NOT CALL CUSTOMER SERVICE TO SET IT UP.  Do a search of easy Roku set up and it will walk you through everything without getting a high pressure sales pitch for additional services.  The picture and options on the Roku are great, but it was not worth the hassle. Will definitely be getting a fire stick.

  In 2010 my husband and I said goodbye to cable tv forever. Since then we have enjoyed Netflix and Hulu (Crackle, YouTube, etc.) via a PlayStation 3 we bought second had at gamestop. I decided to try Roku and finally get rid of the outdated playstation. For $30, it's awesome. IT does help that we have Netflix and Hulu accounts although there is free content on Roku as well. The initial set up is pretty quick. Make sure to look at every single tab. I was a bit put off about the microphone in the remote control and also about having to provide credit card information or it would not allow the set up to continue. After the set up, it worked right away with no issues. I do not like that there is not an off button; you literally have to unplug it to turn it off which concerns me a little (like pulling the plug on a PC, will that affect it somehow in the future?). I love that I don't have to relog into any of my accounts, the picture quality is great. Over all it was a good choice. I'll definitely purchase a second one.

It sees my wifi but signal is almost none. It cannot connect.  Do note throughout this time, if I switch to the firestick, all works fine. Wifi signal is strong, videos plays fine on the firestick.

  I have owned several Roku boxes over the last few years.  I purchased this one out of curiosity.  I read a review which stated that this inexpensive unit was faster than other Roku boxes which cost around a hundred dollars.  I find this to be true.  I recommend also purchasing the mounting device which holds it to the top edge of the tv so the infra red remote is able to work properly.

  I have been nothing but disappointed over my roku. I am a cord cutter and have always been a fire stick user. But recently my fire stick remote went out and the remote was more expensive then buying a new fire stick and remote. So I decided to switch to roku. The performance of the roku is terrible in many ways.The remote - the remote has no range whatsoever. My living room is not large but if I don't have the remote within about 12 feet and pointed directly at the roku it doesn't work. From my recliner I often have to hold the remote up over my head just to get it to work.The lag is awful even when the remote does work. You give the remote a command and it takes several seconds before anything happens.My apps like sling and Netflix are constantly stopping mid stream and backing out of the show for seemingly no reason at all.The screen regularly freezes and I have to wait 20-30 seconds before it worksOverall very disappointed with the performance of this device I would not recommend roku, I will be switching back to the fire sick.

  This was an absolutely horrible experience! The instructions clearly said that this was a very easy set up and it was anything but. I had to reconfigure my modem to allow a MAC address which I did several times and rebooted my router several times. ROKU Support told me to reset the Roku device as well. However, since this was a new device there was no way to reset it. The only thing I could do was to unplug everything from the device  and let it sit for a few moments which I did at least two times. This did absolutely nothing. So this leads me to believe that the device itself is defective because there’s nothing wrong with my router. I kept doing with the instructions told me to do and enable the MAC address. I am sending this back very frustrated and disappointed that something touted as “so easy“ took over two hours of my day for me to come to the conclusion that this was a total waste.

    Ezcellent product if you don't need 4k
  
",5.0,webmonkee,"Reviewed in the United States July 21, 2018","









  
  
    
  We bought a new 4k TV with roku built in and loved it so much we wanted to add it to our older 1080p tv in the living room. This little box is very quick and streams 1080p that looks at least as good as cable or DTV. The remote is actually heavier quality than what came with my roku tv too. The box itself feels like it is empty, it's so light, but it works fantastically.The only differences are that it's an IR remote, so you need line of sight to the box, and you have to switch inputs to use it. Both are absolutely no problem at all. It's a little weird that there is no off button, but I can't imagine it's pulling much power and you could just unplug it at night if you are worried about it.There is no volume control on the remote, so if you are someone who constantly turns the TV volume up and down, you might get annoyed at having to grab the tv remote for volume, but even that is not really a big deal for the cost.Super easy to install and set up. I do recommend using either the included sticky strip, or we uaed a commans strip, because it is so light, it's otherwise easy to knock right off the tv stand. We attached it to the side of the tv. The included hdmi cable is pretty short, but I had several longer ones laying around so no biggie.The only thing I'd change is to include a four foot cable instead of a two foot, but as I said, I had an extra cable anyway, so didn't matter to me at all.

  Had an old Roku LONG ago.  When it finally died, I thought I'd try the smaller Amazon FIRE stick.  Had problems with it from the start.  Amazon was good at providing a replacement, but even 2nd one failed.  Finally 3rd one worked.  But after a year or so, it kept having ""issues"" connecting to Netflix, but not Amazon Prime videos (interesting).  Began to happen more and more.  Decided to go back to Roku stick.  LOVE it!  Better quality remote. No Netflix issues, so far.=================================================UPDATE:  Had the power go out recently.  Now the Roku can't figure out how to connect to my wireless router.  Everything ELSE in the house has no problem!  Tried to troubleshoot without luck.  Glad I hung onto my old Fire Stick, even with it's issues.  Sooo.....now NOT so thrilled with Roku.  A brief power outage should not kill the product.  Bummer, Roku.  :(

  Already have a Roku Streaming Stick that has been hooked up to the main television for a year or so, so was familiar with Roku before making this purchase.  Decided I wanted something similar for the television in the basement rec room, and went for the express based on price.  Installed easily, and has worked as expected.  The router is on the main level one floor up (in a ranch house), and there was no problem picking up the wireless signal.  Great product that does exactly what it is supposed to do.  Love being able to listen to Pandora during my workouts.Update Nov. 2018 - After a trip to Florida in October, came home to find the express was no longer picking up the wifi signal, so I'm in the process of trying to return it.  My Roku stick works fine in the same location.  Researching the issue revealed this is a common problem.  Obviously wouldn't buy this particular model again.Update 2 Nov. 2018 - Contacted ROKU via their website and identified the problem since my unit was still under warranty.  Note that the website has a form for replacement/refund that they tell you not to use unless you bought the ROKU from them directly, but since Amazon's info said to contact the manufacturer, I used it anyway.  After a couple of days, I received a response asking me to try changing my wireless channel (which I'm able to do via an admin login to the router).  After that attempt failed, they sent me another unit with a return label to return the defective unit for free.  New unit arrived within 3 days of their response.  With service like that, I'll happily purchase ROKU devices again.  Hopefully they got the issues with the express worked out.

  I purchased this for one main reason, our cable company, Spectrum, is going all digital. They told us any tv with basic cable line in will not work after the 23rd of this month. Well of course they offer a box to get your channels, but with a cost. I pay way to much now.Yes I have the fire stick and fire tv, but you can not get the spectrum app on those. I found my way to these, and read the reviews until I found one person that stated it works on this.There is one bad thing with this, you need to have a credit card to complete the set up process, and that makes me uncomfortable, so that is why only four stars.I found this works just fine, I notice after falling asleep this turns off. That for me is good, saves electricity.I have three of these, so to keep them organized i have a small piece of tape and the location written down.I have been using this for over one week with no issues. I would recommend this to anyone wanting more options for apps. I will come back if this roku express goes bad.

  I am very disappointed in this product. I already own a Roku 3, which I love, and I've never had any problems with it. I bought the Roku Express so I could stream Netflix, Amazon Video, etc. on another TV. I didn't want a streaming device with all the bells and whistles; I just wanted a simple device for basic streaming. The Roku Express is a letdown. I've been using it for a week, and it loses internet connection several times a day. I have to restart the device in order to stream again. The picture is clear sometimes and very blurry other times.

    Can't handle variable framerate videos - Step down from older Roku 3 hardware
  
",2.0,K. W. Rudd,"Reviewed in the United States October 20, 2018","









  
  
    
  Even though Roku claims that this hardware is 5x more powerful, it fails miserably with content that my old Roku 3 handles without breaking a sweat.  If you have any content that was encoded with a variable framerate (A default setting in many legacy HandBrake presets), you may need to re-encode your files to properly play on the Express (and the new Roku Ultra) devices.I purchased this for my Mother's streaming config, but quickly noticed that it could not handle previous recordings of Dancing With The Stars without serious stuttering and skipped frames.  Thinking it may have been related to her crowded 2.4GHz WiFi space, we upgraded her Roku to the new Roku Ultra (2018) without much improvement.  I ended up moving her Express to my house for further debug.  The Roku Express running FW 8.1.0 Build 4155-51 completely choked on content that my Roku 3 would play smoothly and without issue.  Further debug showed it was the shows originally broadcast at 59.94 FPS.  The HandBrake presets used to transcode the shows was set to use Variable Framerate.  As mentioned, my old Roku 3 handles this transcoded content without incident, but the newer hardware/firmware appears to not support variable framerate content (at least not with a 59.94 FPS source).  Re-encoding the files with a constant framerate solved the issue being seen on the Express, but this step backwards in capability is quite disturbing.  Not a good direction to be going Roku.

  Bought 4 of these to be able to get rid of my cable boxes. Two worked perfect , but two had very poor wifi reception and nothing worked to correct that so I had to exchange them. ROKU has no phone support and offers no support at all for the ROKU Express. I hate companies that don't support their products, but when they work the express is a good alternative to cable box rentals. The lack of a keyboard when using the Spectrum app is annoying, but ROKU's phone app apparently solves that issue tho I have not tried it.Had another express suddenly stop seeing WIFI. Reset and restart made no change and ROKU as I mentioned has zero support for this device

  We love the Roku boxes. We now have three that we use in our kid’s and spare bedroom, so we don’t have to pay Comcast for the privilege of using their small box. The small little receiver box is nice, and fits under the TV, between the speaker and the stand. Samsung TVs have a usb connection that will provide direct power, avoiding the need to use the provided power adaptor.The app itself is nice. It was easy to set up and download the xFinity app and get online quickly. The interface is intuitive and easy to navigate through. My kids like how easy it is to use. The only downside with the small remote is that you have to scroll down through the xfinity guide with the up/down buttons to get to the HD channels (800 and higher).

In less than an hour it was already hot.Not “warm to touch”, but HOT.Therefore, I understand the cheap price now...and I’m exchanging to an upgraded Roku stick.If the heat wasn’t an issue, it’s fine,But NO ELECTRONICS should overheat. Eventually this will damage the device/port, etc.So the 3 stars is because the actual idea and purpose is great, but two stars Off for heat issues.

  I was very happy with this for the first three months and even recommended it to folks! Installation was simple, I could easily stream my Hulu and Netflix and Amazon Prime subscriptions, and there were tons of other cool apps as well. But a week ago, I suddenly started getting an error message that the Roku ""can't run"" any of the apps (except Netflix) and that I'd have to delete some to make space. No matter how many I deleted or unplugged or did a system reset, it wouldn't work. The Roku site FAQs mention that they're aware of this problem with the Roku Express model 3900 and that users may have to ""re-authenticate"" some apps that won't run but clicking on the link for more information took me to a broken link/blank page. My only recourse was to reset the Roku to factory settings and do setup all over again. I find this ridiculous, especially after only three months of moderate use. It appears to be working for now but for how long...? (A similar issue with my three-year-old Chromecast first sporadically refusing to boot and then stopping to respond to factory reset at all is the reason I switched over to Roku. Really hoping I don't have to likewise throw my Roku in the trash, especially after just a few months.)

    HORRIBLE Product Support! Plus ""Free"" requires a credit card!
  
",3.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 23, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this to be able to use Xfinity's streaming service.  But Roku only tells you how to activate it, not how to actually install it, or where to install it.  A 3rd party YouTube video showed how.  You must go to the ""Search"" function for streaming channels and type in ""Xfinity""--it's not a channel, but a service, yet to Roku, it's a channel.  THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE DOCUMENTED ANYWHERE! Not with Roku, nor with Xfinity.  One would assume that any service like CableVision, etc, would have the same issue.  You think that you could call Roku, but they do not provide telephone support for this product, claiming their thin, FAQ-based ""support"" site has every answer.  No, it doesn't. Not even close.  No site does!Then, like Apple, you cannot actually register or use the Roku box UNLESS you give them a credit card or Paypal access, just in case you want to buy or rent a movie.  Why?  Why not make that optional, and if you change your mind you then have to register the card or Paypal, and can deregister it whenever you like.Even to find out if you can have multiple Roku devices on one account (you can) takes an inordinate amount of digging. And there doesn't seem to be (at least what I saw), a way to actually even email a question to Roku.  This seems to be a really bad business model.Once I figured out how to install and activate the Xfinity stream (once installed, it tells you how to activate it), it seems to work very well....so far. Despite only using 2.4ghz WiFi, the streaming seems seamless without interruption. 2.4ghz has the one advantage of reaching further and through barriers better than 5ghz, so it works well in my basement.But the support from Roku is the reason this is a 3-star and not a 5-star product.  I can only recommend purchase if you are either willing to struggle with it, or are satisfied with what it provides pre-installed.Be aware, as well, that the box doesn't have a memory.  While it remember what you're logged on to (I presume that's not locally stored) the device doesn't remember what channel you were watching when you powered down.

  Horrible.  Free channels are loaded w commercials, but that’s not the main issue.  The audio on movies is very low, but the commercials are very loud, so every 5 min I’m scurrying for the remote to turn commercials down before my eardrums bust.  Then the commercial break on most stations last 5-7 min.& comes on every 5-7 min.  Not an exaggeration!  The commercials are senseless too - 10 sec logo pop on between every 1 & since logo is silent & movie audio is so low, you think the movie must be back on - but no - the same ad keeps running over & over & the same 3 movie trivia’s repeate over & over.  Other stations have just 1 :10 or :30 sec ad on before the movie pops back on & that happens about every 3 min.  There are video tracking issues too.  The video sometimes runs in fast motio while the audio track remains normal.  PLUS most channels require paid subscriptions to watch & then only offer a very limited amount of choices & the free stations are mostly B movie crap from a 1-3 decades ago.

    Roku--a new TV experience
  
",5.0,RestlessBoomer,"Reviewed in the United States December 1, 2018","









  
  
    
  I'm new to the streaming TV scene and haven't quite made up my mind about it, but it seems to be ""so far, so good.""  At present, I'm looking for some way to cut my ties with AT&T cable services.  Tired of being charged for so many channels that I never watch and having to contact them each year to try to get some kind of ""deal,"" I decided to give Roku a try.  For the most part, I'm pretty satisfied with it.  The picture quality is decent, although it doesn't seem quite as sharp as the image through AT&T.  I find it to be a re-training experience:  I can't just punch in the channel numbers on my remote and get the station I want (have to go through the Roku Home screen.)  I also can't flip between two stations (i.e., when watching football games) which I can easily do with AT&T--or maybe I just haven't figured out how to do it yet.  These aren't big issues, but as I said, a bit of re-training is necessary.I don't really care for much of what is on TV nowadays and only watch a handful of TV shows and hardly any movies (I have the ones I like on DVD or digitally through Amazon) so I'm thinking this will be a good way for me to cut down on my monthly AT&T bill.The setup was extremely easy and everything seems pretty intuitive.  I'm no computer genius and kind of technically challenged so if I can get this up and running, anyone can.  As I said, it has certain drawbacks for me because of what I've been accustomed to using for so many years.  But if it's going to save me some money, I can deal with a little inconvenience until I adapt.  Sometimes change can be very good.  :-)UPDATE 12/27/19:After using this for a year I give it 5+ stars.  At first I didn't think the picture quality was as good as cable but I was wrong.  Picture quality is excellent.  When you access other streaming channels like Hulu you can get a wide range of available shows, movies and sporting events..  I'm hooked.  Love it, love it, love it!  (I've disconnected my cable receiver but have to keep the basic TV package in order to have high-speed internet.)  Highly recommended.

  I understand Amazon does not make this product, they just sell it, so I can’t say the stars are 100% accurate.We were paying $230 for cable, internet, and a useless home phone because that was the “bundle” through Comcast. We got a ton of useless channels but it was easy to use. The OnDemand was excellent for free movies, kids shows, and searching for shows. Comcast just added Prime to their channel list and it was great. However, that price!Everyone said make the switch to a device. I did a ton of research between Roku, FireStick, Chromecast, etc. I found the Roku the most suitable for us in terms of adding channels (more on that later).I got the Roku in the mail and it didn’t work! We tried setting it all up and nothing would work! We would press a channel and nothing would happen. We had to play around with the connection to the TV and eventually we gave up. So, a month later (and a month of paying for DirectTV) I set it up again, and it took 30 seconds. It worked perfect. I’m not sure what happened at first but it worked fine the second time.Once we had it hooked up we could iliminate several cords and wires behind the TV. The Roku is small and technically easy to hook up and set up. A lot of signing up accounts and passwords with Roku, and the internet but it was easy. Then adding channels took no time on my phone. Once I added what we wanted (Prime, DirectTV) it was simple to watch.Downfalls, are the picture quality is a little less but no biggie to me. The remote is not the easiest to use. To change channels you have to press the weirdest buttons (the down arrow). Also, the channels go by ABC order, which you’d think would be great, except when you’re on TBS and you want ABC. You have to press arrows a lot. You can add channels to your favorites but still, a lot of buttons just to change the channel. Another downfall is FREE stuff. You can get a few seasons of shows for free but when you want more you have to pay for the shows. I originally thought, once you download the channel the shows are free. Not so much. Downloading the channel just makes it easier to search for that particular channels shows.I’ll admit, we are still working things out but so far I would highly recommend the Roku. Saves you TONS of money!

  Not sure about this. I mean it works and does its job as far as being a Roku. It's easy to setup and straight forward to use. My concern is the wireless receiver on this might not be quite up to par. I had a regular Roku and some other wireless devices in the same spot that this is in now, and had no issues. With this Roku express in that same spot (and the other wireless devices removed from the area) there are occasional hiccups in the reception due to wireless signal.I know there's a lot of ins-and-outs when it comes to wireless signals, but I have some professional network experience under my belt and I'm fairly confident it's not a signal issue for where it is based on my testing.Could just be a fluke, but I found the full size Roku devices in my home to be much better for receiving wireless.

  Roku has been around for many years. The ones from years ago are obsolete and slow to operate.This one is many times faster than those.This one is the cheapest with fewest features of the 7 models now offered, but is just as fast as the other 6.NONE of the current ROKU have component cables to hook to a TV (red,blue,green).this one: 1) EXPRESS : HD TV but no 4K TV but has all the channels and menus as the other six. HDMI only.2) EXPRESS+ adds: composite (white yellow) cables instead of just HDMI.3) PREMIERE adds: 4K and HDR (i.e. Ultra HD display which is better than HD but requires 4K or HDR TV).4) PREMIERE+:  the controller has 3 more features: Volume control buttons, voice search, TV power on/off5) STREAMING STICK subtracts: NO 4K NO HDR but adds: portable interface (it is tiny and plugs directly into an HDMI input on the TV). Small as a thumb drive controller remote controller connects by wifi instead of infrared.6) STREAMING STICK+ same as above except  for two things: 1) it does have 4K and HDR. 2) up to 4 times longer range for the controller remote to be from your TV set (advanced wireless receiver).7) ULTRA same as Premiere+ but adds JBL headphones and headphone jack, storage expansion by micro SD card, ethernet port connection option that plugs into a router by wire instead of wireless if you chose to do that, gaming buttons on the controller, find your lost remote controller feature.Only 5 and 6 are small thumb stick form factor and portable that connect box to remote by wifi instead of infrared.

If you set up Youtube TV be sure to go to the internet YOUTUBE page (with a PC computer or smartphone for instance) for advanced features that the ROKU remote cannot control because it has few buttons. So, you set up those controls on the web page and from then on you just use the ROKU controller to use those features.Such as: Remove or Reorder all the channels to how you want them in the Guide list (such as all the sports channels in a row, all news or business channels in a row, etc.) And channels you aren't going to watch much at the bottom or even removed. You use the ROKU remote to click on DEFAULT or CUSTOM to go back and forth from the standard to your revised channel list.You can do other stuff too on the Youtube TV internet webpage such as set up 5 different setups for 5 different members of your family, i.e. 5 different DVR recordings lists , 5 different channels list etc.

    Dismal WiFi Connectivity
  
",2.0,What happened?,"Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2018","









  
  
    
  When it works, I love the Roku. It's relatively fast, the picture quality is great, and there are so many channel options (free & paid) that I haven't missed cable even once. I do wish there was a Spotify channel like on the Fire stick, but that's not a Roku issue. What I hate about the Express is that the wifi adapter is the weakest I have ever experienced. My computer, my phone, my tablet, and my printer are all connected to internet as well as the Roku in our living room, another computer, and two other phones and we never have an issue with connectivity. But the Express on the 2nd floor cannot pick up a single -- it won't even detect the multiple networks half of the time. The router sits at the base of the stairs, we've moved it 3 times now to try and fix this issue, and it still can't pick up a signal even though our 2nd tv sits in a room just at the top of said stairs. When we can finally get it to connect to the network, it lasts for a few hours and then disconnects again.This may be the worst $30 I've ever spent and I can't imagine purchasing another Roku product again if they're going to have such weak internals.

  First Roku I owned just needed plugging and I’d sign into my apps.This one demands to know your name, credit card number, birth date and gender before activation. No, it doesn’t let you leave any field blank, and the device won’t activate without them.And you don’t really need any of that info to use it with your apps. This is just an information grab by Roku.Yes, they try to sell you things, but that should not be a requirement to watch your own subscriptions purchased elsewhere.

  Since I own a TCL Roku tv I thought this was the best streaming device to add to it. I had asked here and was told it works in Latin America so of course usually that means it works in Jamaica as well. Well I got the package on New year's eve and first thing I noticed is how cheap and flimsy the remote look and felt .....unlike the other remotes I got with the tv and then the replacement. I went to instructions and tried to hook up and the usb cable cant be used on my tv because while I can plug into the usb port the other end of the cable is not as described in the instructional booklet or videos and cannot be plugged in as instructed there. Also, there is no 'pairing button' on my remote. However I hooked up using the HMDI port and got it connected. It seemed to be ok as I went through all the steps listed, in fact I noticed that the icons on my tv had changed to accommodate all the new channels offered with the device from the day that the item was shipped. But now when I try to choose the channels that I want I see: 'Cant add this channel.....and this is for all of them including the free channels! I have written to Roku and until now all I got is an automated message saying they have got my complain and will get back to me....I have had a Roku account for the last 4 years since I bought the tv....so what is the problem? It costs more to return the item than it cost for the item here, plus I would have to pay taxes and duties on it once again...totally Not Worth It! I will never buy anything in my life again with the name Roku on it. None of the other brands I have in my house is this problematic....never ever again!

  I got this for my daughter's room so she could access netflix. I love that its easy to maneuver that my 2 year old can do it. I dislike that for every channel you download you have to go online and create an account for it even the free ones. Once you are registered for everything you want its smooth sailing after that though. I went back and bought one for my Ama to have her Spanish channels on. Instead of paying 60 a month she now has them for 30 a month.

  I should start with the fact that I've used other Roku products and LOVE them. I even liked this at first but the stream quality is absolute garbage... I can't watch a Netflix movie without spending a minute or so every 10 or 15 minutes buffering. (my daughter tried to watch a movie and we couldn't finish it because it timed out from buffering for so long)No, it's not an internet issue as my router is 1 room away. I have 60gb internet, a good router, and a dedicated 2.4Ghz channel dedicated to this Roku.I hadn't used this for a bit after getting it as it's for my 'extra' TV so my ability to return this for a better device is not an option unfortunately as the return window has elapsed.I strongly suggest getting the Roku Stick as its performance is MUCH better than the Express.Lesson learned I suppose.

  UPDATED DECEMBER 14, 2018: Sound on Roku device is distorted across all ""channels"" /apps. Customer service difficult/typical of outsourced service to work with. I recommended to the rep that he (and all tech support reps) should take notes during each phone call because they ask you a question then move on, only to ask the same question again and then act surprised by the answer as if I didn't answer it the first three times he asked. So I actually say that to him, he placed me on hold to check on something and yet when he comes back, guess what he asked me? Same question again.Anyway, the reason I had to call Roku Tech support is because, not even two months after purchasing the Roku Express, it's broken (and no, I didn't drop it. I'm clarifying because my use of the word ""broken"" caused the tech to ask me repeatedly if I dropped it despite my explaining that ""broken"" to me in this case means the sound is distorted and garbled no matter when streaming app I select, including the Roku streaming). Btw, he didn't know the meaning of distorted or garbled and it was quite the challenge to describe and explain by trying to imitate the sound with my voice (he didn't want to hear it on speaker phone). He was very patient and polite while dealing with my frustration. So, at least there's that.He offered to replace the Roku once I return the device to them but I would have to pay return shipping. I vehemently protested saying that I paid shipping the first time when I purchased the item (let's face it Prime prices include shipping) and I am NOT going to pay shipping for their lack of a quality product. In comparison, I have an Amazon Firestick since 2015 and a Google Dongle that I've had since 2014 that work as well as they did when I first got them. I only bought the Roku because of a couple of different apps that the Firestick didn't have. And the Google Dongle doesn't have a remote so it must cast from my phone which is inconvenient. I'll let them replace the device because of the extra apps but honestly, after seeing others reviews of this product, I wish a is bought another Firestick instead.The fact that they tried to pull the ol' ""just pay for shipping"" on a customer that's stuck with the inconvenience and hassle of their poor quality device tells me all I need to know about this company.ORIGINAL 3 STAR REVIEW OCTOBER 22, 2018: I like that Roku has a couple of apps that my Firestick doesn't. I don't like that their technical support does not have the necessary knowledge to walk me thru being able to mirror my Android phone to the screen even though it clearly has the option to do so. (I've selected the option on the Roku screen settings but no one seems to know what I should do on my phone.) Roku is not a brand new company. I expect when I call for tech support that if the tech who answered doesn't know then he/she should get me in touch with someone who does and can help.Also, my personal preference is that I don't like the way access buttons on the remote for Hulu, Netflix, CW and Sling. I find them in the way, especially when I'm streaming something at night in the dark. I watch foreign content using subtitles and I have to rewind more often to get what I might've missed. Those buttons are in the way when I'm sleepily trying to chill and watch tv. I can't just go by feel too rewind as I might accidentally leave my movie by hitting the wrong button.

    Not working with XfinityStream
  
",3.0,Sue L.,"Reviewed in the United States November 13, 2018","









  
  
    
  The product seems to work fine but I am sending it back.  I was told I could use Roku (and this unit was one listed by Xfinity) with Xfinity Stream and watch my regular Xfinity programs via the Roku without using a remote box.  I hooked it up and registered the Roku and was finally able to find the XfinityStream App and download it.  It wasn't easy to find, and there are no directions anywhere I could find.  When I first installed the XfinityStream App (and got it authorized) it worked great--and continued to work great for three days.  On the fourth day,  it quit working--meaning it wouldn't allow me on to watch TV from the app, and I got a message that basically said that I can't watch shows except via my in home internet--which I was on.  I called Xfinity, and they first told me it was a system issue that they were correcting.  After three days,  it still was doing the same thing, and I called back.  I was then told it was  a Roku issue, and I needed to contact them.  It is nearly impossible to find a working number to contact Roku , but I was able to find one eventually, and the first number I found,  the  call simply wasn't answered.  The next time I was placed on hold for 35 minutes, and when I did speak to someone, I was told it was an Xfinity issue.  They were both very gracious at passing the buck to the other, so in the end I decided I will send it back since I can't use it for what I wanted to use it for.  I wished I could send Xfinity back too, but I have no other viable option at this time.  Summary, the Roku work fine, but not for what I wanted it for, and they are very cleaver in hiding contact numbers for people to call them about issues.

  We had to go to Roku when Spectrum required a big box for every tv in our home, some of which are installed on walls that won't accommodate the box.  I really like Roku - it is relatively easy to navigate and we stream virtually all apps we need, including the Spectrum app (while we are still keeping cable tv service).  The downsides are (a) Roku does not return to the last app you were using so you have to re-open Spectrum each time we turn on the TV) and (b) none of the Roku's I've seen have channel number buttons so that you can go directly to a channel rather than scrolling (even when you've set up 20 favorites, it is somewhat cumbersome).  And the Express doesn't turn on the TV or control volume, so you still need two remotes (for another $20 you can get a Roku that does both)

I bought 3 Ruku Express  to replace the 3 cable boxes I returned.  Once I installed the Xfinity Stream app on one Roku box,  It shows up on all 4 Roku boxes in the same Roku account.  These boxes paid for themselves in 3 mouths.

  We had a Roku 3 for a long time and it was everything we wanted, no problems. Unfortunately, it developed a heat-related electronic problem where is just stopped sending video for a few seconds fairly often after it was in use for a couple of hours.  I would buy another Roku 3 if it was available but I had to settle for this model.True, it is very compact, but I already have the space in the console under the TV. This model cut costs by cutting out features.  First, it they took out the Ethernet port which I preferred to minimize wi-fi bandwidth in the house and my router is right under the TV.  Second, instead  of the RF interface for the remote, they've gone with the cheaper IR led which means I have to be pointed at the unit and the unit can't be inside the console.  Now it's more clutter on top.The presets on the remote have been changed so that now only one of the four buttons is useful to me.  They should give us the choice of re-programming the channel preset buttons to something we use.  Also, the buttons don't have a good de-bounce design.  I frequently get multiple button hits from one button press.This redesign is not a design improvement.  Presumably, it helps their profit margin.

  As an alternative to paying Xfinity/Comcast $7 per month for each box on all your secondary TVs (the ones other than the main TV with the main cable box), turning those back in and streaming the Xfinity signal directly off your modem/universal gateway is cheaper in the long run.  We had 4 other TVs in our house beside the main one in our family room.  We could have conceivably put TVs in at least 3 more rooms.  With the proprietary Comcast mini-boxes, that would be $28 to $49 more a month on our cable bill.  Instead, we turned in our 4 and installed 4 Rokus at a one-time cost of around $30 each.  For us, they will pay for themselves in 4 months and then save us $28 per month thereafter.  As an added bonus, we get ALL the same channels on our Roku-equipped TVs that we get on our main TV with the main Comcast cable box/DVR instead of just the basic channel package we got with the Comcast mini-boxes.  The only downside to the Roku is that it works off the wifi signal from your gateway so you may have to install signal extenders in some cases to get a strong enough signal to reliably feed the Roku.  The remote is also very basic and channel selection is not as user friendly as the one-button remotes we are all used to.  That may improve in the future.  In the meantime, the slight inconvenience is nothing compared to the money saved.  We LOVE our Rokus!!!

This little thing is tiny, seems about 4"" wide, 1/2"" thick, and maybe 2"" depth? Smaller than the remote. It comes with HDMI cable, and also a small power cable so I can plug it into the TV - and don't need to use the wall AC plug (the instructions say if there is a light coming on the little box telling you 'not enough power' then use the wall plug.Holy cow, this little thing is blazing fast to select, load, etc. - maybe faster than the Roku 2?

  First let me say I came into this after using a previous version of Roku as well as a Fire stick and Apple TV. I have run all the updates and expected little more than to have this run Netflix, HBO and Hulu. I am on a 300+ Mbs internet connection so load time and buffering have not historically been an issue.Within the first day or two after setting up the system I noticed that Netflix as well as HBO both cause the system to become unresponsive and eventually will force quit or require a manual pulling of the power to exit. Long hanging load screens or the more comical scenario where the remote will simply be ignored while Netflix plays some preview loop happen every 5 to 10 minutes while browsing. Inexplicably the system will start to stutter playback regardless of the channel.The price is good if it worked as well as a Firetv device but it just doesn’t. This is such a poor showing from Roku that I am really questioning whether I got lucky on the first device I got from them.What a shame.

In the process of trying to change my password, Roku informed me that they would capture lots of my personal data and use it to target ads.  So the money they charged me for a product that doesn't work wasn't enough.  They want to sell my privacy.My advice is as simple as the title.  Buy any other product.  You could try a paper weight.

There are so many apps that there aren't enough hours in a day to watch them all.What's best about it is there's no need to purchase a TV with streaming capability which can be very pricey.  As long as you have a TV with an HDMI connection or A/V cable composite port (use the ""Plus"" Roku models), and WiFi, you can use any of the Roku model.  Set up is simple and easy.

  Roku is a fantastic way to ""cut the cord"" if you are looking to save money on cable or satellite.  Roku offers LOTS of content - some free, some paid - including all the traditional channels you know.  Roku is interesting in that it has channels on topics you would never think could be a channel (much of which is free), so you really have endless choices in terms of tv shows, movies, music, internet, and other content.I deducted one star because the standard Roku remote control included in my Roku Express package was absolutely terrible.  It was so bad that anyone who bought it should get some money back from Roku.  The fact that Roku included that standard remote with their product is an embarrassment.  I think it worked a little bit on the first day I bought it and after that it stopped working.  So, I trashed it and bought a remote control that is compatible with Roku and it works much better.I was hesitant about cutting the cord at first.  I've had either cable or satellite for most of my life.  But, now that I've done it there is both money savings and lots of content to browse.  I highly recommend.

    Best streaming bang-for-the-buck, best in class universal search
  
",5.0,Jonathan W Besanko,"Reviewed in the United States January 30, 2019","









  
  
    
  I was looking for the easiest way to get streaming apps on a TV in the kitchen, and the Roku Express fit the bill. It comes with a two-prong USB wall power adapter, but most modern TVs, including mine, have a USB port that can power the Roku directly from the TV. There's even an included  velcro tie to keep any excess length in the power cable tidy. The included HDMI cable was long enough to reach but not so long that routing it out of sight was difficult. The included adhesive strip was a nice touch, making mounting it to the underside of the TV quick and easy.The biggest drawback compared to the higher-end Roku devices is that the remote is IR, which means it does require line of sight in order to work, but since sticking it on the TV is so easy it's not an issue. Just know that you can't have it hidden behind the TV or inside a cabinet and still have the included remote work.The best thing about all Rokus is the software. It's dead simple to setup and navigate, and the search is better than the Amazon Fire stick because it doesn't prioritize any service. You can search for a title (or actor, etc) and it will show you results from every service available. This is especially nice for surfacing results from the free apps that I wouldn't think to search otherwise, like Sony Crackle or the Roku channel. There's a ""Featured Free"" category that's very nice for surfacing content that's available outside of the major streaming players like Netflix and Prime.The remote is small and lightweight, and uses two included AAA batteries. Unlike fancier Rokus, it doesn't have a headphone jack on it, but if you put the Roku app on your phone you can achieve the same thing and listen through headphones. That's particularly handy in the bedroom for late-night viewing that won't bother your partner. The phone app also let's you use your phone as a remote control.Even though the chip in the Express is the least powerful in the Roku line, navigating and starting videos is still responsive. It takes about five seconds for the unit to ""boot up"" when it first powers on, but after that there aren't any slowdowns or stutters.The value is fantastic. For any secondary, non-4k TV, like in a bedroom, guest room or kitchen, the Express is the best streaming option to get. Everything you need to get up and running is included-- it's nice that on such an inexpensive item they're not nickel and diming you by not including batteries or HDMI cable.

  I thought Roku was a good way to avoid having my router next to the TV (I'd been using ethernet to power Bravia on it) because of its wifi capability.  Plus the Netflix interface seemed to be compatible with the computer's interface and I could start shows on Roku where I'd left off on computer.  But six weeks after buying this thing the remote stopped working.  Actually, it's worse than not working.  The remote is randomly powering on the TV and scrolling through menus, but it doesn't accept commands from its buttons.Since it has been six weeks there's no way for me to return it to Amazon.  But the Roku website says there's no way to return it to them because I bought it from Amazon, meaning they essentially have no warranty unless you buy directly from them.  So I'm out 30.00.  This is not a normal way of doing business now, is it?I would suggest staying away from this scammy product, or at least buy it from Roku's website so you can return it when it breaks.

I updated and added my Amazon account and it did take me about 20 minutes to figure out what the buttons did and how to get from one place to another. It has literally been the best thing that I could have purchased in electronics in the past 3 years! It is super easy to use and it works. I do not have internet do the fact that we live in a rural area and it would cost about $78 a month. I have AT&T Hotspot through my phone and that is what I use. We have watched movies and series and I have yet to see any lag. If you're wanting to get something, especially for your child in his room, I highly recommend this. Probably closer to Christmas break I will get another one for our front room, but for now having this in his bedroom is amazing. We have tons of movies that I have bought through Amazon Prime and I'm so thankful we can watch them without his Kindle.

    Great product and better than a Chromecast & Firestick.
  
",4.0,Shopper One,"Reviewed in the United States August 4, 2019","









  
  
    
  I've been hesitant getting any Roku products because for some reason, it felt like Roku was for the crowd that used to love TiVo and couldn't transition to much more advanced technology. I've had multiple streaming devices including several generations of the Google Chromecast and Amazon Firestick. The whole deboggle with Google and Amazon fighting and preventing consumers getting the YouTube native app on the Firestick left a bad taste for me. The lack of a physical remote for the Chromecast after so many years felt Google was delivering an incomplete product and casting wasn't reliable. Given all this, I decided to give Roku a try and went for the lowest cost product, the Express. To not make this story any longer, it's been over a week and I've already found more channels and content than both the other streaming devices, for less money. I've converted to a Roku user and will be for a while.

  I like it. My router is out of date, so it was necessary to order a new one to clear some wifi setting issues and be at industry standard. Now, I have to say this to be fair: I like the advertising. It is my sincere wish, that I don't end up having to pay for each stream I wish to use in lieu of just paying for cable, and that's a fair statement. The packaging was great, as promised, easy to unpackage, setup, and install. A true asset because my roomie failed to pay the cable bill, so I decided to strike out on my own with the Roku, and so far, this is a really great addition to my roommate because I am now somewhat self sufficient. This product is really cool! Can't wait to see all the awesome channels there are to come, as I improvised by setting a HD antenna outside on my roof for free television. With the Roku, I feel that I have gained so much, I don't need anything else. My needs and prayers have been met. Thanks Roku! Cheers! Mark , Fresno, CA: )

  These devices run hot and the wireless capabilities will suffer eventually.  I haven't even had this for a year and it barely works now even when the device is sitting right next to the wireless router.  I swapped my other Roku Express in and it works fine, probably because I haven't had it long enough.  The Roku site sends you back to your point of purchase when you try to get a warranty replacement so I'm screwed.  If you're using it to watch the Spectrum app you're kind of trapped using Roku so that must be the scam, to keep you buying more.  Might have better luck if you buy the Ultra but who knows.

  I have purchased probably close to a dozen of these devices.  First, I do like the way these items work.  My problem starts with the complete lack of customer service.  Probably the worst I have ever seen, it just doesn't exist.  My other issue is their lack of cooperation with my cable company, Spectrum.  This was a great sales feature of Roku devices to have the Spectrum App available for download.  And at this point, the Spectrum App is no longer available for download through Roku devices.  Unless you have previously downloaded it.  This leaves us with no updates, or continued support, on a product that already doesn't even have customer support.  Never again will I purchase or endorse this product.  At one time I thought it was one of the best.  Roku is in desperate need of a corporate overhaul.  It's rather sad.  I can't express the amount of disgust and dissatisfaction with Roku.  Please be advised, before purchasing.  And I do hope this review could be amended!  However, I doubt such an event!

  I've been using Rokus for many years , probably going back to the 2nd or 3rd generation. I've always liked the simple interface that works, but they've always been a little slow for my tastes. Just getting to the channel you want to watch and getting it loaded up seemed to take so long. But not wanting to buy into the Apple landscape, I just sorta lived with it.A few years ago we bought a Fire stick to see if it would alleviate our desire for speed and we were so put off by the buggy nature of it that we went back to our 2013 Roku. It still works, almost 6 years later, but it's definitely on the slow side of things.I finally decided to start looking to see what's out there these days and I found this little unit for a very budget conscious price point and I was intrigued. I was a little worried about the specs because memory wise, it's comparable to our old Roku, but it seemed like the processor would be a little snappier.WOW, I can say this well exceeded my expectations, it's very fast and responsive. The UI is familiar and intuitive, everything just seems to work, and now it's fast to boot! If you're on the fence about this unit due to speed, I can honestly say it works great. I want to put one of these on every TV now!The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because at first pass, the picture quality didn't seem as good as it could be, but it's not bad by any measure. If I could give it 4.5 stars, I would, especially given the price point, I'm not sure what else out there you could possibly get any better for. This is a great little unit, I'm very happy with it.

  This is my 4th Roku Streaming Adapter. All have worked flawlessly. Wish the remote had TV on/off button and volume control with mute as some of their other models have. Have to use the TV remote for the missing functions. A minor annoyance. The first time you install a Roku device you do have to set up an account that requires that you give them a credit card number but nothing is charged to your account unless you purchase some of their options. There is no requirement to purchase anything from Roku to install and use the adapter. To install more adapters you simply log into your account and set up your device. There was a notice in the box that stated that Roku does not charge for setting up the device. If you are required to pay then you have reached a scammer. Restart the set up procedure and make sure you enter all the requested data correctly.

I did report them for trying to scam me out of money , you don't owe anything once you buy the package, you get everything you need from the HDMI cord to a sticker to stick the Roku on to whatever it is sitting on and you just plug it in and go , even comes with batteries .

All devices in my house (including an older roku device that is at least 5 years old) are working with our internet service, but this is no longer connecting, signal is always poor no matter where the modem or hotspot is. At first I thought it was our internet service but found that others are having the same issue with this model of the roku as well. Called roku to try to get some assistance and a recorded message told me ""you are not eligible to speak with a representative, but we have created tools online"". I'll get another streaming option, there's plenty of them available these days! So disappointed, because we were considering buying the newest roku since it's only $30. Funny that the older products are still working and this is a tiny piece of trash after less than six months.Original Review: I have the older version of the Roku and bought this for a different tv. Works great! Smaller remote and smaller receiver which is great, but I don’t like that they took away the strap. The strap helped me find it!

  I bought this because Xfinity told me I could use Roku instead of an additional cable box (added $10 per month) with the new Roku Xfinity beta application.  I wanted to have a second bar TV in the basement for football game day so hoped it would be exactly synced with live TV from the standard Xfinity Comcast cable boxes.  Well I found out that over the Roku system, “live” Xfinity broadcasting is 30+ seconds delayedfrom standard Xfinity.  Also to go to channel 654 for example you have to push the channel up arrow on the Roku remote 600+ times!  Also if you read more about the Xfinity Roku it is only free now while in beta version and will cost about $8 per Roku system per month which is almost the same as a standard cable box from Xfinity.  So this really isn’t a good option.

  I had a roku previously and loved it. Then I lost everything in the paradise ca fire last nov. So I bought a new one. This time I upgraded to the roku express. The first problem is I love the big bang theory and watch it all the time, I own every episode. Which is the main reason I bought it because my tv does not have the google play app. I have gone into the settings over and over again and set it to binge watch and it still stops after every episode. My first roku did not do that. The second problem is my other favorite shows are on Hulu, the goldbergs, Brooklyn 99 and others. It will let me binge watch on there, but everttime it goes to a new episode it begins at the last few min of the episode. So evertime I have to be near my remote and rewind each episode before I can watch it. So very disappointed. Maybe I just got a defective one? Because like I said my first one worked great.

  This is a great no-subscription streaming device that has TONS of channels to choose from. Some of the channels have costs associated but offer 7 day or month long free trials While others are completely free. The interface is user friendly and pretty easy to maneuver with a pretty decent selection of backgrounds or skins. It does need to update or refresh once in a while, but that is to be expected with any type of software or user interface. It DOES include channels like AppleTV, Netflix, RedBox, ABC, CBS Now, Fandango Now, and several other popular channels as well as some relaxing ones like a fireplace and a fishtank. There are also ones such as PlutoTV which is a no cost for Basic and if you want premium, its something like $19.99 USD per month. It's definitely a great alternative to cable and direcTV. The device itself is super small and barely noticeable. It comes with an adhesive so you can stick it to the side of your TV, dvd player or whatever. I just slapped mine onto the shelf where my TV is mounted and good to go. I would actually recommend this over a firestick or any of the others. I have had zero problems with it.

Took a month of Emails with Roku for them to finally get them to honor their warranty by sending me an address to return the device at my expense. Got a lot of E-mails from them unaccountably telling me that soon they would send me another E-mail. It only took them about 2 weeks from the time I shipped the defective Roku till the time I got the replacement, but no contact in the interim to let me know they had received it or had shipped.  I had to E-mail them after tracking showed they had gotten it.So the new Roku shows up. In the mean time they have changed their Web Site.  I can no longer enter the passwords for Netflix and Prime on my PC or at least find a way to do it and their is no tech support beyond selecting canned topic no chat no phone number.

  Good: Much bang for the buck. Handles 1080p streaming with only occasional (< 2x/evening) buffering or other hiccups. Wifi performs well even with less than optimal signal. Command response isn't immediate, but adequate. App load times are slower than the higher-end boxes, but reasonable.Bad: IR receiver seems insensitive; had to experiment to position the box to where it could be controlled reliably.Ugly: The same complaint many, many other Roku users have: *you can't turn it off.* You have to remember to press ""home"" before turning the TV off, otherwise it keeps on merrily streaming away. I don't have a data cap on my internet service, but I could easily see someone burning through theirs in a couple of forgetful nights, or wondering why their low-end broadband is sluggish when nobody's watching TV.  A smart remote can be programmed to do this at power-off time, but having to use a remote costing three times as much as the Express kinda defeats its biggest advantage. Roku really, really needs to address this. A simple sleep-on-power-off signal would fix it.Bottom line: We ended up going with a Roku Ultra for the living room home theater setup, and it turned out the Express is perfect for the bedroom set. All I have to do now is find a sub-$100 remote that will let me home the Express with the power-off button. Five stars, minus about a half for the  sleep/power-off issue.

  Good quality and good streaming with a so-so remote.  This unit replaced a perfectly functioning ""Roku HD"" we bought so long ago we don't remember when ... circa 2004 I think but that could be wrong.  No matter.  We've ditched Netflix for reasons not mundane here and went with Prime Video back when ""The Expanse"" was announced as a Prime pickup.  Prime sent me an email last July saying my XD model (yes, XD model) would no longer be supported as of 9/26/2019.  Prime customer service assured me that my HD model was not affected. Of course on 9/26 I suddenly needed a new unit.  Why was that not a surprise to me.The Roku Express works just fine and setup was not easy exactly, but after you're followed all the steps they were gracious enough to display a message saying I couldn't do this via the TV so please got to a website.  So kind of them to tell me that after wasting time with multiple steps and a tiny button remote it was never going to work that way.It's obvious Roku is being paid by several providers, the cute little remote has four locked pre-programmed little buttons for services I don't use.  Not so bad; they're really not THAT ugly and seldom get bumped accidentally interrupting your viewing enjoyment.  I guess it was just too expensive to program them to allow blocking or re-mapping.Would I buy it again?  At under $30US yeah I probably would.  Recommend it? Sure with caveats.  Is it a reliable unit?  Ask me again in 15 years.

So, I'm use to a quick responsive glitch free streaming with HD and 4K movies from Amazon Prime, Netflix, and Vudu. However, we have a 40"" Vizio HDTV in a small guest bedroom that doesn't have a RJ45 jack. I read some good reviews about these new Roku streaming sticks and decided to give it a go. Plugged into TV, went through the easy set up process to connect to our WiFi with no problems. Well, first of all I was impressed how fast the Menu interface was, which was on par with my other Roku devices, except maybe the Ultra. After installing Prime, Netflix, and Vudu channels - I tested out a couple of random HD titles. It buffers fairly quick and the playback was smooth with good sound/video quality. A couple of times at the very beginning of playback it was blurry for 10 - 20 seconds while it went through it's bandwidth negotiation process with the content provider, which is something you don't typically experience plugged into a Fast Ethernet 100BASE-TX port. I recommend this little guy. It's great and you can put it in your pocket and plug into the TV in your hotel room while traveling, and watch a Netflix movie before bed.

  Ok so the only drawback is having a visible target for the remote (you mount a small box to your tv or nearby).  I have owned the ancient google chromecast device, the amazon firestick, and now the Roku.  The chromecast really worked fine but it was nearly impossible to stream amazon prime, and ours just kinda got old and unreliable (but it lasted a really long time before that).  We got a fire stick on a good deal. It was the worst of the 3.  For one thing google and amazon are constantly fighting each other. So on the firestick we could access amazon content easily but not YouTube.  The remote for the fire was CONSTANTLY chewing through batteries.  Like I'm talking quarterly battery changes here. Amazon filled the fire with advertising and it just wasn't a great user experience.  The roku is neutral in terms of content. They have their own content but it's pretty poor and not a reason to buy the stick. They work super well with all the major content subscriptions and don't fill your tv with ads.  I've been really happy with the remote and with the user interface of the roku.  The only thing I miss about fire TV was telling Alexa to pause the tv (and I'm not even sure Roku doesn't work with Alexa I just haven't tried yet).  The neutrality of Roku is so worth getting it, plus at full price, it's actually cheaper than the inferior Fire.

    conversation with Roku Tech support very BAD
  
",1.0,Shirley A. Whitson,"Reviewed in the United States April 28, 2019","









  
  
    
  I hooked up the ROKU properly. When I was sent a password to my TV screen it would not connect, I requested another Password from ROKU, they sent me one which also did not work so I was instructed to call ROKU Tech Support, which I did. The associate told me they would connect me (I read everything )and not a thing said I would be charged an additional $100.00 for activation, he was arguing with me saying then they could not activate and insisted on me giving him my credit card number. I told him I would report this to someone, that I am a 71 year old women and purchased the ROKU at the advice of BLAZE TV telling me I could then get their channels and that it was very inexpensive, again not a word about a $100.00 fee. When I hung up the phone with the ROKU Tech I unplugged the roku and put it all back in the box and called Amazon who told me they would refund my money ,which is fine. but when I went back to my TV I lost the FIOS box , somehow this ROKU blew out my box according to Verizon because verizon tried to send me a signal and told me I needed a new set top box. I am scared my information was somehow hacked by ROKU, now my wifi in my home does not work ,,,what else can these people at ROKU do and I cannot prove a thing. Do you have any advice to me for protection???Thank you for your time

    Trouble finding Wifi

  When I first set it up it worked great.  It easily saw all the Wifi available and I was able to connect it quickly.  After a few months it doesn't seem able to detect Wifi very well.  It doesn't see any of my neighbor's wifi, doesn't see my router, and sees my extender which is only 10 feet away as a barely usable weak signal.  Some of my apps no longer function due to the ""weak"" signal.  Note: My phone indicates all signals are strong.  I emailed Roku because it is under warranty.  They made me jump through a few hoops but then agreed to replace it.  I have to pay for the postage and send it back before they will send me a new one.  I will of course be without Roku for a few weeks as a result but I can live with that.

  I've used various versions of Roku for a few years.  Like the way it displays the different streaming channels, and for most of the simple things, on-screen instructions are adequate.  But some things are extremely frustrating.  For instance, popup will sometimes say that a micro SD is recommended to save time loading channels.  This occurs on my Roku 3s and Roku express.  So I bought a couple of 128GBs and plugged them in.  The 3 could not finish formatting one, and the Express never acknowledged it existed.  Should also point out it took some research to even find out where the SD was inserted - have to unplug the HDMI cable??  Anyway, nothing ever got formatted.  Went on line and could find nothing on ROKU site until I went to the community - which said anything over about 4GB was wasted.  So I tried a 16GB, but still would not finish formatting.  And the Express still never acknowledged it existed.  There are too many versions of ROKU, and nowhere on the ROKU site does it adequately explain what the differences are.  There are a few functions for a few versions, but certainly not enough to clearly explain the differences in the versions.  And forget talking to anyone - don't exist.

  I've probably had 10 Roku devices over the years.  They stream for awhile, and then they stop working.  I just bought one more; the Express.  This time, they've made logging into the Roku webpage so complicated that I can't get logged in.  It's been an hour, and the site put me through at least a dozen screens of proving I'm not a robot'.  I changed my password (unnecessarily), and am still getting more screens of 'proving I'm not a robot', and ultimate failure to recognize my login credentials.  I've tried two different devices for logging in, and still no success.  I'm finding no contact information for technical support.  Roku used to be okay.  Not great, but okay.  Now it is broken.

Excellent HD on all channels. In most markets, you can't get local channels but that is remedied with an indoor antenna.

    It's a Mistake not to get the Voice-Activated Version
  
",3.0,Sunny Day,"Reviewed in the United States May 16, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought two of these at the suggestion of my Xfinity cable representative who offered them as cheaper alternatives to the cable boxes I was renting for extra TVs.  New to streaming, I got the least expensive rokus and I realize now I made a mistake.  There is no way to select a channel on the remotes, so when I stream my entire Xfinity lineup, I have to toggle through hundreds of channels to get to the channel I want and the toggle is slow.  I know that streaming in general isn't really compatible with multi-channel lineups, but even using the apps are a problem.  For the channels I like most, some of them, like Turner Classic Movies, requires the user to go to a phone or desktop first and enter a validation code EVERY TIME I USE THE APP.  Jeez.  I already authenticated my roku device.  That should be enough.  Lastly, in addition to turning on the TV and then getting the roku remote to wake it up, It requires about 8 clicks and a wait time in between each, just to get to the channel I want.  I admit, cord cutting has been tough for me, and after 6 months, I will have equalled what I was paying in renting cable boxes, so I will eventually save a ton of money.  But this particular roku is laborious.  I wish I had spent more to get the voice-activated version to go directly to the channels and apps I want.

  I've been planning to cut the cord due to not realizing the value of my cable subscription (cost vs time to enjoy it). Finally pulled the trigger and got the entry-level Roku instead of the more expensive versions. Best $24 I've spent in a long time! Easy set-up (10-15 minutes) and lots of information available online about setting up channels and how to get the most out of a Roku and I've cut the expense of cable, including rental of hd boxes and the broadcast channel fee (roughly $80/month). The media available (ad supported but not the obnoxious ads that always show - I'm looking at you medicines and Mayhem!) is easily enough to keep my free time occupied and varied enough that I'll never catch up. Glad I made the leap and hope others continue to jump ship. The higher end versions are very niche but if you have  solid broadband speed and don't have specific hardware needs, this is the one for you.Pros:Simple interfaceGreat variety of contentNostalgic shows and classic media that is now in the public domainLots of current content and news media availableMedia loads well and is HD qualitySubtitles available for most contentDirections and setup is quick and simpleCons:Remote can be too small for some peopleNo number pad so not easy to quickly surf some of the channels with lots of contentMust point remote at the IR receiver

    ROKU smaller version
  
",3.0,T Wagaman,"Reviewed in the United States August 14, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this ROKU as it was a smaller component to add to the other component I have for my TV.  I'm trying to get the channels I want without paying the extortion price from the cable company.  Having a ROKU allows me access to multiple free channels, plus my Amazon Prime and HULU all wrapped up in one item.  Here is my issue with this item:  My router and the cable box are all in one location right behind the TV that this item is installed on.  However, I have to log in every time to my HULU account because it tells me that I have a network connectivity issue through this ROKU, however, my Amazon Fire stick which is plugged in to my TV in my bedroom upstairs from the router not only logs on but remembers my password even though it is the same WIFI connection.  I have contacted troubleshooting with both ROKU and HULU and neither has been able to rectify the situation.  We have the fastest internet service we can get through the cable company so don't know what the problem is.  I gave my kids the ROKU 2 we had that was hardwired into the router which I never had an issue with.

    Happiness with Roku Express doesn't last
  
",2.0,RMorr,"Reviewed in the United States September 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  When we made the decision to cut the cord and move to streaming for our TV needs. I researched our options and decided that we would try Roku. We purchased 2 of the express model and 1 stick model. The stick was crap from the get-go and so I purchased another express and things were working great on all TVs. This was last summer. Fast forward to now and the Roku Express on our main TV loses internet connection nearly every day even though it says that our connection is excellent at the same time. This also happens periodically on the other two TVs with Roku Express but not anywhere near as often as the main TV. This has been happening for a few months now and I am tired of having to restart/reboot everything to get the connection back. I have hi-speed internet with both 2.4 and 5.0 GHZ channels. The only things on the 2.4 channel are the TV's with Roku Express. All other connections are to the 5.0 channel and they have no loss of connection when the Roku has it's problem. I have found so many people have this problem from looking at the Roku Community on the Roku website yet no answers or solutions are ever posted by Roku. I think it's time to dump the Roku and switch to something else. I hope this review helps someone keep from making the same mistake I made when buying Roku Express.

  I had an old Sony Blu-Ray wired streaming device that required my TV, streamer and modem to be wired together.

This ROKU works better than my old Sony and will last until I decide to upgrade my whole setup.  At that point, I will still probably keep it and use it on a second device until it wears out.

  Roku lies from the opening statement.  ""Plug it in and start streaming."" Wrong.  Only after purchase does Roku say it.  They demand a credit card, just to activate.  Why?  Paraphrasing ""It makes it easy to add channels and make purchase.""  Creating an account is where activation process began looping.  ""Create account, Select a PIN, Account,"" back to ""PIN"".  No escape.  Was it because I insisted on requiring a PIN to authorize any purchases?  Well, yes.  As soon as I selected ""No PIN required,"" the cynical process moved forward to step 3.Roku's devices are far too cheap to make real money.  The real game here lies in post device purchases and channel subscriptions; thus the ROKU  ""Channel Store""  Thus the mandatory ""Payment Method.  Roku is the HP printer/ink scam all over.  The money's in the ink, and the data they collect and sell, and the ads they sell to third parties and then pimp you with.  Roku is an ad and sales platform.  Streaming and aggregating sources simply gather the audience.  Roku obviously  hopes to become it's own ecosystem.  It's also similar to the in-game products created by video game makers; real ads, virtual and physical products.  Take a step back and Roku looks exactly like a cable operator.  The ads are simply on the platform, rather than pressed into the content.  It's also the Tivo data-mining format.  The device is just the cover charge.  It's been some time since I've witnessed a company this brazenly dishonest.  I returned it and got an Amazon Fire Stick.  And no, Amazon didn't pimp me to include that.  Amazon has earned my trust.  Roku has destroyed any hope of it.  Enjoy.  I'm out.

  I have, by today's standards, pretty slow Internet. About 20 MBPS using DSL. I was previously using a Sony Blue Ray player for WIFI TV.  I used it for YouTube, Hulu, Netflix. But two things were extremely frustrating. One was just scrolling with the remote control. It took a long time for the device to receive the button command and then process it. I saw a delay of up to 5 seconds just trying to scroll a few frames or going to other video options. And of course, picture quality would also suffer as the speed just wasn't there, often down to 240P or even less. Hulu would just sit and say ""Loading"" for a half minute at a time. Then display a few frames and go back to loading. Unwatchable. The Roku changed all of this. I now watch in 720P or greater all the time. Plus scrolling to functions on the screen is instantaneous. I'm guessing its because of the much faster processor and also the buffering memory and techniques used by the Roku. I'm in TV Heaven!!Update 4/7/2019:  I sometime get the ""famous"" 1080P flicker. Doing research, this has been a know problem with various Roku models for some time. I had to force the Roku to 720P to make the flickering stop. I get inconsistent results. Some videos, even those recorded at 4K, work just fine. But then I hit some that flicker like crazy. I'm guessing its some sort of compatibility issue with the camera folks use to record their video. I see the same video on my laptop and I see NO flicker. Perhaps the Roku video processor has a glitch. Other than that, I am still happy with it.

But DO NOT put ads that are not G rated. I don’t care if you advertise a rated R film. Don’t put porn or violence up for the ad!!!!Consider getting a different streaming service if you are a family hoping your kids won’t be exposed to porn, blood, and gore on the basic home screen.

  I'm going to go with a mixed bag on this one for the sheer fact that this is a basic, beginners, Roku device. Here is the catch, although this is basically true with any level Roku, this one is very limited on the number of channels it can store and view at any given time. If you are just starting out with a Roku, or any streaming device, then the first thing you probably notice is the endless list of channels/apps available(there are LOTS OF them). If you are anything like me you want to add all of them, well I found out after about the fist 150 I ran out of memory/space. Bigger things like Netflix, you tube, prime, etc. take more memory. The more expensive devices hold more channels and have faster streaming. But for starting out it is an excellent device to make an older TV new again. I hate the fact that the remote doesn't have volume control on it. You have to use the original tv remote for volume and other settings.

Works great.The roku channel alone is worth grabbing a Roku when they go on sale cheap, like black Friday for example. I also found it hilarious the Prime Video app on Roku was far better than trying to use the prime video feature on fire TV . it is so much more obvious and easy to find content - a reason id canceled prime in the past.You can't side load on this device - if you know what that is, then you probably knew that already. But, this is a great device out of the box and has the better navigation and ease of use over fire TV. I use both since there is exclusive content to each device, and side loading options on fire TV, but the roku channel is worth the cost alone.

  For those of use that have forsaken cable television in favor of digital entertainment, the Roku Express is probably one of the cheapest and most high-quality streaming devices a person can buy for their home television. It's extremely easy to download all the video apps you could want, and the device is so small that it can fit pretty much anywhere.My only real complaints are that the power cable and HDMI cable provided with the device are so hilariously small that you'll probably need to put it somewhere very close to a power outlet and either directly above or below your HDMI ports, unless you actually feel like investing in longer cables. Also, for some reason Twitch has removed itself from the Roku platform recently, which is kind of a bummer, as watching Twitch Streams is one of my favorite time wasters, but in the grand scheme of things, it's not really a huge deal and it also doesn't appear to be Roku's fault anyway so I'll let them off the hook for that one.All in all, the Roku Express is great for college students, TVs in rooms without cable access, or just anyone looking to ditch their cable box in favor of a cheaper, more versatile (and in my opinion, better) alternative.

Since the TV itself is still in good working order, we thought a relatively cheap fix was to purchase the Roku device.Pros:- it was super easy to install- functionality is very simple- we've found a lot of streaming apps we didn't know existed and have really enjoyed thatCons:- it takes a while to get signed in to all of the apps you want to stream, and you have to set up a separate account for a lot of apps- quite a few apps offer limited or no streaming without a cable/satellite subscriptionOverall, we have been very pleased.  We went in knowing that most streaming costs money somewhere and we have a DirecTV subscription so that makes streaming easier for a lot of the apps

Hooked up my new Roku Express, brought up YouTube TV and signed up for the free trial. Turns out the free trial is 5 days, not 30. Called Amazon customer support and spent half an hour on the phone with no resolution before being cut off. Called them back, spent another 35 minutes with still no resolution. After over an hour of wrangling I gave up. Learned my lesson... just wanted to pass it along. Do not buy this product on the basis of the 30 day free trial and get burned like I did. Unless of course you and everybody in your household can agree and decide you prefer YouTube TV to competing services in just 5 days. I'll end up spending another $40 to make that decision, more than the cost of the Roku Express that I needed to find out.

  We cut the television programming from the major cable network providers due to the continual increase in cost. This device is small and hardly noticeable. The remote works well. There is some free television programming and pay for television programming. We found a network that has all the main networks we watch, minus a few we might watch from time to time. The good news is we are saving about $100 per month compared to the cost of the major cable network providers. The Roku device more than paid for itself within the first month!

  Roku Express. This thing has been a mixed bag. Using it along with converter on an old projection TV.  Picture quality is fine, audio fine.Con: Intermittently cuts to a color bar screen and audio goes dead, for about 15-20 seconds.  Thought it was heat related but sometimes does it early, sometimes late. No pattern to it. Doesn’t seem to be getting worse, can’t tell if it’s failing or not.Con:  Runs pretty hot to touch, and in one 3 hour viewing session we got a heat warning on screen.  Case doesn’t appear to be ventilated. Considering adding an external heat sink.UPDATE 6-20-2019:  After running a laptop to the same TV, using the HDMI/RCA converter that the Roku was connecting through, I discovered that the intermittent glitches I was attributing to the Roku were being caused by the HDMI/RCA converter, not the Roku.  Revised review to 5 stars.  Can't criticize the thing other than it does run hot.  A vent or a heat sink would help, but heat apparently doesn't affect performance.  In months of use in long streaming sessions, it's only given us a heat warning once.

  This device is a more open environment than other streaming players, but it arrived without a power cable.  As it takes a  USB micro, I was able to locate a cable.  I contacted them the very next day, August 23 to get a replacement cable.  Here it is, Sept 30 and we still do not have a resolution.  After the request, they took several weeks to respond and then only to ask me if I still needed help.  This level of customer service is unacceptable and I cannot get past that to praise the abundance of apps.I bought it solely because the other streaming device did not have a popular music service.  However another bad thing is that is does not have a native web browser, they want you to share from your cellMuch as I love the functionality of this device I cannot recommend it until they up the game on their customer serviceAmazon is far superior in that respect

  -> No longer will have Netflix available as of 12/1/2019.So I love that I was able to ""cut the cord"" and switch to using just Roku & Spectrum's super inexpensive streaming service. Plus having Netflix & Prime Video available to watch through Roku has been fantastic!!BUT I am pretty bummed that Netflix will NO longer be an option to watch through this model of Roku (and several others) as of Dec. 1st 2019. I didn't realize you'd have to eventually upgrade to a newer, more expensive version of Roku if you wanted to keep being able to use Netflix (if you have a subscription, it's not free with Roku just so you know ). My version is completely fine, the remote still looks new, there's no need for me to upgrade, yet if I want Netflix I will have to.ALSO, get the app! It helps me to navigate things easier than with the small remote. You can click on shows, channels etc and search for them by typing instead of using that on screen keypad that's so annoying.

  UPDATED: We purchased out Roku in February of 2018 and loved it for the most part. It did crash from time to time if we switched between “channels” or apps too quickly, but forgave for the 20-second reboot time. This is until about 4 or 5 months ago. The crashes started happening almost daily...sometimes 2-3 times in a single day. NOW, something has been going on with FandangoNOW and Roku’s systems for about 2 weeks and we haven’t been able to view a movie we authorized on 8/30. Two weeks of endless holds to both FandangoNOW and Roku customer Service departments has netted nor more than passing the buck to each other, promises for calls back and resolutions that never come. As of 8/14/19: unless you have the higher-end/premium Roku devices, Roku does not offer technical support with a person, refers customers to the website for troubleshooting. Our experience has been appalling over the past two weeks. If we had known we were going to have to replace this device in a year-and-a-half we wouldn’t have purchased. WILL NEVER DO BUSINESS WITH ROKU AGAIN. BAD FORM.We love our Roku, but didn’t plan on replacing it after a year and a half, which looks like is going to be our only option. Disappointing.Purchased the Roku Express early 2018 and it still runs perfectly! This is a great product!

Apps have a more modern layout. This is a really easy item to use and there is a ton of free programming on here. Plus YouTube has an app now so you can stream videos from there. You can SmartCast from phones or tablets also.I am familiar with Chromecast and AppleTV and I still prefer Roku. I have not used FireTV. Yes, they are all the same. No, they are not all the same.

  I have Fire Sticks and I do like them. Here's some Pros and Cons that I've noticed comparing the two streaming sticks.Pro:1-When I purchased mine, the Roku was $10.00 cheaper2-When watching CBS All Access Live it doesn't automatically start the Close Captions (very annoying)3-Watching Philo TV,  past episodes of the different series that are available it goes to the next episode. With the Fire Stick you have to advance it.Cons:1-You have to have the stick placed so that the remote can ""see"" it. Just like most TVs you have to point the remote at the stick. With the Fire Stick you can point the remote anywhere that you want and it does what you want.2-When you are done watching TV the stick does go to sleep, but it plays a screen saver like your computer. The Fire Stick plays some of your pictures, then shuts the screen off after a few minutes.3-No voice capabilities with this unit, if you like to use your voice.All in all I am very happy with this.

  I've been a fan of Roku since its inception and that enthusiasm has only grown. The device has allowed us to cut the cord when we grew tired of the exorbitant costs associated with cable and satellite subscriptions. I purchased multiple ""Roku Express | Easy High Definition (HD) Streaming Media Players"" as Christmas gifts.  Everyone loves the utility, performance and value of these small devices. They are so easy and intuitive to use and the only failure we have ever encountered is a dead remote - easily and inexpensively replaced. New channels continue to be added regularly.

  I was a little worried because this is so small. We have a larger Roku in the living room, one that has an Ethernet port, since it's near the WiFi router. But we needed one for our bedroom, at the other end of the house from the router. I was worried about buffering, either because the device lacked enough power or because of the distance from the router, but it's been fine. It's very compact and light. My son actually got one for himself when he left for college and he has his stuck to his TV -- it comes with a sticky pad thingy for that purpose.We've been able to use this with the newer apps that some of the older Rokus don't support, like DirectTV Now and Hulu and the app that comes with Spectrum, our cable provider. It was easy to set up.

  Anyone who's thought about cutting the cable should get a Roku and/or Apple TV box.  Plenty of content to stream out there (Netflix / Amazon provide almost all you need).  The Roku box works well and is easy to use. My only complaints are that a) it uses your network information, you cannot override the information such as DNS (helpful if you want to watch local sports) and b) the power cord was rather short - considering it'll be on top of your TV it should be a little longer.  Otherwise it's a fine streaming device. Hope this helps!

    Best streaming option

  Bought this to stream content to a 32"" bedroom TV.  I already have the Roku Ultra 4K in my theater and a FireStick in my living room.  They both do the same thing, but I prefer the UI of Roku a bit more, and for $25, it was a great deal.  Had it connected and up and running in about 15mins.  The longest part was waiting for all of the apps to download.  I run Sling, Hulu, NetFlix, Showtime, YouTube, and Amazon Prime Video, and all work flawlessly and display 1080P video on the TV.  I like how small the module is as well, and have it affixed to the bottom of the TV which is wall-mounted about 6ft high.  Don't forget to download the Roku remote app on your smartphone to control your Roku right from your phone, especially if you'll be typing any information.  It's much easier on a keyboard on your phone than it is to select each letter/number using the Roku remote.Bottom line - if you don't need 4K and want a simple to use, compact streaming solution, this is the best bet and works great.  Even comes with an HDMI cable, power cable and USB outlet base (I don't use the base, but instead use the USB out from the TV to power the Roku), and batteries for the remote.  Also comes with a double-sided sticky strip to affix the Roku module to your TV.

  Always love Roku the Roku is definitely something that it's more on the cheaper side than Amazon and all those other products come by and small on the cheaper side and it's a great product dishes it takes a lot of data and internet speed in Wi-Fi speed in order to run it because of how cheap it is it takes a lot more speed than the other one so it'll take up all your Wi-Fi and let's start making your wife I trusted start drawling along so just make sure that you have a home Wi-Fi network and you're not using the same network that you are utilizing on all other devices make sure if you get the Roku device that you have a separate Wi-Fi network specifically for that Roku because it will drain and start messing up your Wi-Fi after so long of using it if you like watching TVs and all that different types of stuff like that like I do you're going to drain your Wi-Fi no matter if you have Spectrum AT&T Verizon it doesn't matter what they don't tell you is that attached straddling networks and it will cause your data and your Wi-Fi in your home network to start straddling somebody if you only have one device other than the Roku connected it will draw it will start to slow your home network speed or your data down like it's nothing it is the home network data and your data. Up like it's nothing but cake so I will recommend making sure you have a really strong the strongest Network you can possibly get strictly and only for the Roku that's because of how cheap it the Roku device is that's the reason why it takes so much Network Power in order to run it properly otherwise a thing ain't going to work for too long you will be having a return it because you going to be looking at okay I can't even watch it it's constantly saying loading loading loading loading you ain't going to be able to get through not even one part of a movie let alone the TV show let alone login in so yeah that's just my advice

  I like that the Roku express offers the Xfinity app so you don’t need an xtra set top box as you can utilize what you need on the Xfinity app, set recording of favorite shows, but after a few days Netflix would just shut off while in the middle of a show, and then again, I checked signal strength of the Roku and it said excellent, I am not sure if this was just a Netflix connective error, I have a Roku 4k stick in living room and the express in the bedroom, I noticed the express shut off it’s wifi connection while the 4k stick was in use as well but the 4k stick is actually further from my modem/router, the express stick is about 15 feet away with no walls in the way. I moved the express location from the side of the tv to face directly towards the router, I haven’t had an issue since I did this so make sure the face of the stick is completely facing the modem/router you have, it may not be as strong as the quad core 4k stick and it also was during heavy WiFi traffic during the day when it did cut out. I will continue to monitor the connectivity issues if this stick, if they subside and it becomes reliable I will repost, I have had the 4k stick lose signal once and a hdcp error once, otherwise I am content with Roku, I also have Apple 3rd gen and Apple 4ktv, but mainly bought the Roku for the Xfinity app so I can return my set top boxes. For $29 it’s a good choice or amazon fire stick at $25 is a great choice too, had no issues with amazon firestick.

  I just bought another Amazon Stick to find out it doesn't work with my cable company's app. I buy this and it works. Pretty straight forward to set up . Navigating is a bit non intuitive but I am not sure if that is the Spectrum App or Roku or me.  Roku tries desperately to sell you paid content, be careful because in the terms of agreement they will not tell you when a trial period ends, if a trial is valid (you had a trial previously and are no longer eligible for another promotion), and everything is set up with auto-renew so you will get a nasty surprise later. There is an option to set up a pin code for all purchases (even the free ones). I really like that the express version does not have a microphone.  Since I am not familiar with many of the Apps, I am not totally clear which are free and which are paid subscriptions.

  I often am more likely to have the same experience of those who write 5 star ratings. I read the bad ratings, look at the percentage of each rating given, and take the chance that I'll have the 5's experience. With the Roku Express, the odds caught up with me.Also with the recommendation of a Comcast rep, I bought 3 Roku Express devices in April of 2018. Each was to be used with TVs not watched often so paying the Comcast box rental fee wasn't cost effective. I have generally been satisfied with the one time purchase cost and no rental fee, but the Roku for one TV location has continually reported poor signal. I have had Comcast service technicians look at the issue in my home 3 times. Finally, it dawned on me that the issue could be a faulty Roku. I interchanged the poor signal Roku with an excellent signal Roku. The problem followed the device. Junk.Looking back at the reviews with the thought of ""purchase again,"" I see that my good luck in following the experience of 5 star reviewers has come to an end. Beware: poor signal strength is a very common complaint.  Since 6 months have passed, I'm not going to subject myself to ""customer service,"" but it would be a great idea for the manufacturer to realize there's a problem and do something about it because the functioning Roku version is pretty handy.

  every old TV become a smart TV with the Roku. Its interface is very intuitive and they have increased their offer of channels. Perhaps for most customers it will be enough however, it is no match for the Amazon Fire Stick TV if you travel overseas with it and if you want to have the freedom to install apps like Kodi (for streaming and media player).The main issue of the Roku is that is very limited when you use it overseas, is not compatible with android/google apps and is locked or limited to its own environment. Kind of like Apple products. If you like them fine but you cannot do much more of what the brand gives you.Since I got my amazon Fire Stick, I rarely use the Roku because it is more compatible and flexible. I still prefer the UI of the Roku though.

  We currently have Dish, with the Hopper and Joey. We successfully programmed our Dish (version 54.0) to also control the Roku. It wasn't without its problems though. For anyone who wants to use their Dish remote to control the Roku, here's how we did it:1) In your Hopper or Joey, go to Menu > Settings > Remote Control2) Under DEVICES, select Auxiliary Device > Television, Next > Auxiliary Device PARING WIZARD3) Select the same TV that's already programmed for your remote4) Repeat steps 1, but now, under DEVICES, select Auxiliary Device > Television, Next > TEACH COMMANDS > ADD COMMANDS5) Follow the on-screen instructions, to teach your Dish Remote (54.0) all the Roku's buttons.Note: There is currently a bug in the Hopper 54.0 remote that may cause the Hopper Remote to freeze, in AUX mode, if you press a button that isn't assigned to a specific command. The solution, for me, was to simply assign every button on the Hopper remote to a coinciding Roku button. In my case, I assigned all unused buttons (e.g., 0 - 9, ""Guide"", ""DVR"", etc) to the ""*"" button of the Roku.Presto! Now you can click the ""AUX"" button of your Dish Remote, and you should be able to control your Roku with your Dish remote, including your TV's volume and Power button.Hope this helps someone.

  Our cable bill was escalating almost every month so I looked into these sticks. We tested it on 2 TV's and love it! We still need cable to provide us with Internet and our local broadcasts (including Phillies baseball, which is proprietary to Comcast). This will save us over a $100 each month on our bill!!!Pros:Very easy to set up and figure out. Add the Xfinity app, log in, and you can see the typical Comcast interface. Easy to access other streaming 'channels' such as Netflix, Hulu, Sling, YouTube, etc. You can also add MLB/NFL/NHL channels and major news channels. As long as your internet is good and fast, you'll have no 'buffering' issues while streaming movies and TV shows.Cons: If you're using the Xfinity app, you have to search for a channel by number or network letters. There are no numbers on the remote so this can take awhile. You can scroll but, with hundreds of channels now, that can also take awhile. I was told to add channels to favorites on a TV that is still using a Comcast box and then the Favorites feature carries over to the Roku app. You cannot designate favorites while using the Roku.If you're watching a Comcast DVR'ed show you can still fast-forward BUT the screen freezes at the point that you clicked on the FF button so you have to estimate when the commercial ends by watching the timer. This is a little annoying. You also can't delete a DVR'ed show from within this app after you've watched it.The remote is also missing power and volume control buttons. I heard the newer models have them but that doesn't help me! You'll either need to keep your Comcast remote (charges might apply) or use the remote that came with the TV or purchase a universal remote.

    Speedy, Watch all Your Services, Turn Dumb TV Smart
  
",5.0,Gabi,"Reviewed in the United States December 20, 2018","









  
  
    
  I bought this to use on an old LG Smart TV that was seriously outdated. The Roku stick was a much cheaper choice than replacing the 60"" TV itself.I was able to add Hulu, Netflix, YouTube, Amazon prime video, and Vudu as ""channels"" and watch everything I wanted. There are also some random kids channels that I found in the channels store that I use to watch some Disney or Nick Jr shows with my daughter.The remote doesn't work too well with the Roku stick behind by TV when I try using it from a chair about 10ft away, but you can also use the app on your phone as a remote, to search channels and shows, and to shortcut to a channel.I tried using the sticky pad to stick the stick just under the frame of the TV so it would be barely noticeable and the remote would work better, but I either did it wrong or it doesn't work very well because it wouldn't hold for more than a minute.The is WAY faster than my Amazon fire stick that I bought a couple years ago. I was very impressed with the speed of navigation as well as the wifi connection which my fire stick failed at.I love being able to use all my preferred video-watching apps on the old TV and it was so much less work than replacing it (especially since it's mounted and weighs about 40lbs). This would be perfect for turning a regular TV into a smart TV.

  We're trying to lower the cable bill. I don't watch live television a lot, and wanted a device that would work with Prime Video, and the Spectrum TV app. After doing a lot of research, this was my 2nd choice. The first choice was pure fail, and I won't name the product, but it's sold here. Draw your own conclusion what it was.The Roku is more intuitive to use. It's fast. This model lacks the 5Ghz wifi connection, but it hasn't balked once when streaming at 1080p using any of the apps I added. I'm happy with its performance after using it about a week.Nothing I say here is going to be new to you if you're reading the reviews. The most important thing to remember is this one works, is easy to set up and use, and the picture is beautiful at 1080p. If you want 4K, get a different model, but were I you, I'd stick with a Roku device.

  First, to use the Roku you need an account and to provide your credit card information, this by itself is a no Go!Sure, there is a backdoor allowing you to register your Roku without taking the risk, but you have to Google to find the trick...I also realized that using your cellphone is the easiest way to download apps, navigate and it is much more convenient than using the remote provided with the Roku.The thing I dislike the most is how limited are the Roku apps and how full of adds and bloatware they are and also they are very obtrusive... The Roku is locked, you can't install Kodi or monitor your privacy, you are not in control.I thought first that the Chromecast was very limited, but finally, it is the shortest way to get any content on a Tv screen. The Roku, just ad another layer of hardware and it is just making the process more complicated.

  I was all set to love my Roku device, and I've had it for a while, but it will not connect to a wireless 5GHz network, which is what I have.For that reason it connects only to the lower speed option and constantly buffers. Annoying when you're trying to watch anything. It's mind boggling that this would even be a thing. It should be a no brainer that you'd want to connect to faster wireless for streaming video. All of their sticks should have this capability. Consider upgrading to one of the more expensive options. Supposedly Stick, Stick+ and Ultra will work. Basically I wasted $25 bucks.

  I'm brand new to this type of device but I'll try to give an understandable review.  I'm usually able to set stuff up and understand the basic workings of them.  That said, I bought this so I could watch BritBox.  First off, I needed help with set up.  Getting the channel I wanted, which I'm assuming ""user interface"" means, is kind of confusing.  Ended up ordering BritBox three times in error (not sure how that happened and didn't find out until my charge card bill arrived).  Using this isn't always easy.  There have been times when I've given up and just gone to bed but I'm assuming it's because it's new and I'm still learning.  The remove would be WAY nicer if it were lighted.  I'm happy with the channels available and hopeful that using it will become easier.

  I rarely write reviews. But I really felt like I needed to write one.First. To even set up the product, it DEMANDS payment details. You can't actually use the device to stream without giving it your banking information.Second, while going through the whole process, it constantly spams you with ""offers"" and ""deals"" and tries to trick you in to paying for a subscription for various services at outrageous prices.If I hadn't already opened the box, I would've returned it had I know. I'm glad I only bought 1, because I'll be buying a different product to replace this and sending it to the trash.Pro Tip: Get an empty or almost empty pre-paid debit card or gift card to use as a ""decoy"" for not only scammy stuff like Roku, but any other ""Free trials"" that require a credit card.

    Inexpensive streaming stick, good video quality
  
",5.0,Paul T,"Reviewed in the United States August 17, 2019","









  
  
    
  I'll start off with my favorite feature that (for me) sets it above the Fire Stick. Roku has the Xfinity app (currently Beta version) which enables me to watch live TV through my Xfinity account as well as all my recorded shows. This is way cheaper than adding another Xfinity box to new TVs.One thing I'm not too happy with is the four dedicated buttons on the remote (Netflix, ESPN+, hulu, and sling). Only one of these buttons is useful to me and I would have preferred them to have custom buttons that you could map your favorite apps to.The User interface is pretty good but it really promotes Roku content and your customizing options are a bit limited to just reordering the apps.The unit itself gets pretty hot which was surprising. I measured it at about 125 degrees F after being on for only 30 minutes. It also needs to be placed so the remote can receive a signal (line of sight). Supposedly it comes with a strip of two sided tape to mount under your TV but mine did not come with this. I just recommend putting it somewhere it isn't crowded against other things so it can air cool.

They work better than the sticks and don't have the overheating issues or the sync issues with the remote.  The only feature you miss here is the remote with the tv option of volume control, but quite frankly that remote doesn't stay synced to the TV longer than a few days so what good is it anyway.  I highly recommend spending LESS money and getting a BETTER product!!  Will be using these from now on... although, since they work so well, I probably won't be replacing them like I did the sticks!

    A Great Portable Version of the Roku Family
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States November 10, 2018","









  
  
    
  I have been a long-time fan of Roku players.  They offer great picture and sound quality, a myriad of streaming channels, easy setup, durable products, and fantastic consumer support.We have a couple of Roku Ultra players that have served us well for years.  One time we developed an issue with a Roku remote and the company immediately sent us a replacement free of charge.We wanted a more portable version that is easily packed in a suitcase or duffel bag, but offers the same quality as the more expensive Roku players.This player is very small (fits easily into the closed hand) and comes with a remote, batteries (for remote), USB charger and cable, and HDMI cable for connecting to your TV (Roku also offers an analog version for much older televisions).Setup is a snap.  Everything plugs in quickly and the welcome screen appears.  If you don't have a Roku account (especially great for proof of purchase), you create one, then authorize your television, adjust a few basic settings (picture format, etc) and then the player installs the most frequently requested streaming channels.You have the option later of adding more channels or deleting ones you don't use.  The main interface is neatly arranged with large colorful blocks with each channel's logo.  The menu is pretty much standard with all Roku players and is intuitive and easily navigated.This player was set up and fully operational in less than 10 minutes (depending on the speed of your Wi-Fi network).Though I highly recommend any model Roku player, this one is especially useful for those who want a ""player on the go"".  It's reasonably priced and has great bang for the buck because of the quality and features.

  I don't know why we waited so long to ditch cable and go with roku instead. We got rid of our $600 a month cable bill in favor of Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime Video. Roku allows us customizable access to all our favorite media portals and is easy enough to use that we even got one for my technophobe 67 yr old mom and she loves it. The remote is a tad annoying because it's small and tends to get lost fairly easily but we bought a universal remote to rule over all things electronic and the annoying little remote isn't needed anymore. I love that nearly all the universal remotes I first researched were compatible with Roku. It made choosing the right remote that much easier.

They needed more info, which I replied immediately. It has taken 14 emails and a lot of time. They sent me 1 RMA and no answers. No one reads the emails right from the beginning. I gave them all the info on both units. After all the emails, not one answer to my questions concerning how hot these units are and since they don't read the emails, they never realized I have 2 units!!! This company is terrible!

I had a stick b4 and had no problems, so I believed they were a good company until now. They have very limited CS.

Roku 3 remote died years back and I replaced with a cheaper one, has crappy range and no hulu etc buttons. Also my guest tv is an older flat screen and doesn't have a usb port, and a power outlet cable for this is out of the way.This one reaches from across the room, has netflix/hulu buttons that I didn't know I wanted till this. My only complaint is that I didn't realize that it doesn't stay on, and only turns on when the tv does. Takes about 20-30 secs to boot up each time, not an issue.The sticky pad it comes with to stick to my tv, while it does it's job. I think it will fall off soon as it doesn't look very stable, no matter how much I tried to mess with it.

  My 3yo and 7yo can both operate these very basic remotes. (Don’t worry, they do not glue themselves to the TV all day.) I like that I can add and delete channels from the devices from my phone. I also like that I can use my phone as a remote when theirs get lost. I can even pause and start their shows from another room. I can even easily switch the remote in the app back and forth between our two devices, so pausing one Roku won’t pause the other. We especially love the PBS app because of PBS Live. In a world where kids can get used to being able to pick any episode of any show on Netflix/Hulu/Prime and watch commercial free, it’s nice that PBS Live means they have to watch whatever happens to be on, with commercials. And it’s FREE. I’ve missed PBS since we cancelled cable. It’s nice to have the channel back. In theory, it would have been nice to bring these on trips to use with hotel TVs, but the one time we remembered, the TV at the hotel oddly didn’t have ports in the back. At any rate, I would totally buy this again!

  Had an awful time connecting to wifi network in my college dorm. I bought this specifically because it says something about have a workaround to dorm/hotel wifi. This system apparently only works if your phone is connected to the identical network and ip. Modern dorm building that have hundreds and thousands of routers throughout the campus on the network have a strange enterprise type network system, meaning my phone or laptop is not technically connected to the identical server that the roku is, even though they are in fact connected to the same wifi network. Same problem with the app. Roku app will not open at all now because it does not think my roku, (that has already worked on my home network with my phone when I first used it) is connected to the same network. Another major reason I bought this was because I needed to listen to movies and such with headphones and seeing that the phone app supported this I thought it was the perfect choice. WRONG. Can't even open the app due to the wifi protection nonsense. You need to be able to register and pair your phone so it can work regardless of the type of wifi network you are on. Yes, my phone has already been paired to it in more than one app. Youtube app flickers black constantly. Menu freezes up even when given ample time to boot up.Don't buy it.

  We bought this because it was less expensive than getting a box from Spectrum which is what we watch the most with it. It's difficult to go from one channel to another because you have to go to the guide and scroll to what you want unless it's a channel you use a lot. The remote doesn't have numbers to select channels. Also, it will sometimes go to buffering in the middle of trying to watch something. So, if you don't mind scrolling or waiting occasionally for buffering it's better than paying monthly for an HD box from Spectrum. It does have many other apps to use like VUDU, HULU, Netflix ect. but we don't use them.Here's an update. We had this one 5 months and it continually says can't connect to the Wi-Fi which is on the other side of the wall. All other devices work well in this room. When it does connect the picture is blurry and sometimes goes black. This was supposed to be a substitute for an HD box from out cable company but if we have to buy another every 6 months it won't be worth it. It does have a year warranty but I've misplaced the receipt. Also I see others have had this same problem.

  We have streamed via Roku for years and this was our third upgrade.  At first everything worked beautifully.  It's very fast compared to older units and puts out a beautiful picture.  However, after a month when the return period ended, the sound started acting up.  It would only play very low.  I tried everything -- changing HDMI cable, changing sound settings on ROKU and TV, trying it on another TV -- and nothing worked.  Out of options, I brought out my old ROKU.  Although slower, the sound is back and the picture was always gorgeous.I've always recommended ROKU to everyone, but this particular Express unit did not work for us.  This was the first one we ordered from Amazon because all others were bought directly on the ROKU site.  We probably just got a lemon but knowing that and not being able to replace it does nothing for us.

  Forget about adding your own apps through Amazon Prime, it can't be done.  The Remote is so Weak, I had to maneuver it beside the television, because the signal won't reach through the flatscreen, and even with it exposed, beside the set, I have to aim it 'just right' in order for it to work. The Apps are all 'their choice', and the overwhelming majority are 'pay per views'.. In order to activate the service you MUST place your credit card and personal information in their website, Even if you're not interested in ever purchasing any thing from this company. They (ROKU) also INSIST on having your personal information, just to get the device you've already paid for, to work - I'll be ridding myself of this poorly designed, security risk soon. DON'T BUY THIS - IT'S AWFUL.

  Almost identical to Roku Stick. I bought 1 of each and the only difference I see is that the Roku Stick remote has a microphone.The reason this gets 4 stars instead of 5, it because of Roku's limitations. The remotes all have very few buttons because there are many conveniences of TV and cable remotes that aren't available for internet TV.The things I miss immediately are:1) Seeing the progress when you Fast Forward or Rewind. If you use these, you have to guess when to stop.2) There is a  10-15 second rewind button, but not a skip ahead button.3) There is not an info button, so you can not get program info while watching a program.4) If you stop a program in the middle, many of them automatically start from the beginning when you go back in, so you can't pick up where you left off, and if you try to Skip to where you left off, you have to guess (see issue #1).5) The pre-programmed buttons can not be modified.6) I quit watching live TV several yrs ago, so I'm used to being able to FF through commercials, but, I'll adapt again.7) There is no way to channel surf. You can't scan programs while watching a program.

I had only a vague idea of what a Roku was, but after I opened the package and followed the to-the-point documentation, I had it up and running in a matter of minutes--very few minutes at that!So far, we've used it to watch Amazon Prime video, tested a few YouTube videos, and we've been watching Pluto TV--which we didn't know existed until now. Thanks to the Search feature, we can find out if there is a free streaming version of just about any movie or telly show we can think of, or comparison shop for a good rental or purchase price. Most enjoyable, and far better than watching on the computer. To be fair, though, we've had it for all of two days. It's still a shiny new toy for us!

    A perfect alternative to cable that streams 1080hd with no problem!
  
",5.0,Dale H,"Reviewed in the United States October 19, 2019","









  
  
    
  I hesitated for several years to purchase this item.  I figured for the exceptionally low price that it would either not work well, or be cheaply made.  I was absolutely wrong on both ""thoughts.""  This ROKU item works perfectly and streams very well.  No buffering while streaming 1080hd movies from Amazon Prime and Hulu.  No issues with YouTube.  No issues with various other ""free"" channels that are available.  The free channel selection is awesome.You can upgrade and stream premium content as well.  However, I cut cable years ago to save cost and only have Xfinity high end internet that works with this item extremely well.  I have three computers and two printers on the wireless network and now the ROKU.  All works well.Set up takes a little while as you have to sign in on your accounts for things like Amazon Prime, Hulu and Youtube.  The television displays a code that you then type into a web page that they give you the web address to.Several years of sitting at the desk watching movies and of course (WWE) can now be viewed on the big screen TV with no additional monthly charge.

  I have tried almost every option to get away from the cable tv high bills and now that I have found the ROKU I have cut the cord. We have actually bought three so far and looking at a fourth before the beginning of summer. Keep in mind that this is internet based streaming and a good strong connection works best but we are running our ROKU's along with numerous computers and many smart outlets and lights and is very rare for for it to stop and buffer. I love them and would reccommend them to anybody.

  I have used roku products since they first came out with no issues until now.  Received the Roku express and after setup, could not install channels, received an error saying insufficient storage space, remove some channels to free up space.  I had 2 channels installed (Netflix, amazon) and could not add any others.  did a factory reset, no help.  What really gets me is I go to Roku support and find this little gem for the express ""Agent-assisted support is not available for your issue and/or model"" only online knowledge base which did nothing for me.  This is going back, thanks Roku.  I guess its time to start looking at other options, you lost a long term customer with your nonsense.

  I wish I could give this a negative star first off I ordered this because of what it offered which I thought was great but I only needed it for Netflix but I said let me give it a shot . The Roku came in today I set it up and said I needed to activate it which is fine ! Then the code they gave me didn’t work so I called customer service got them on the phone told them what happened and long story short the guy told me that I needed to pay $80 dollars for activate all the shows Netflix and etc and I said $80? There’s no way why do I have to pay that I just paid for the box online . And he said that’s there no policies that the policy for Roku changed 10 days ago ! Those are his exact words ! Then I said well I’m sorry I’m not paying extra 80 and he told me “ WELL YOU SHOULD OF DONE THAT FROM THE BEGINNING INSTEAD OF WASTING MY TIME” and let me tell you he was rude he whole time and I had it and went off and told him that you don’t ever talk to customers that way .. just a heads up because I was in shock !

  I purchased this Roku to replace my 6 year old Roku 2500x, which was still working well, but not supporting the latest app updates. After a super easy install, registering my device, adding and logging into my apps, I was good to go in about 20 minutes.The streaming quality is perfect. The picture is crystal clear.  The menu is super intuitive and I love being able to use the latest app functions, such as ""skip intro"" on Netflix, something I couldn't do with my older Roku.  I'm really happy with Roku as a brand. I don't buy smart TVs because the apps can quickly render your TV obsolete. I'd much rather buy a ""dumb"" TV and upgrade my Roku for a fraction of the price.Definitely worth the money!

  This is a great product to cut ties with the cable company. First, very clear and easy instructions to get the Roku connected. I purchased this to go in the master bedroom where we have a Vizio flatscreen TV model number E321VL. I used the cables provided and the picture and sound are perfect. Second, the remote is very simple to use. They even walk you through the basics of everything in a short video. Third, I created an account (for free) and downloaded the app on to my phone. Again, everything very simple even for me - I am not a very techy person. Fourth, signed into my Prime account to get the Prime movies and music in the bedroom. Finally, I went in the living room and found the Roku app on my Samsung smart TV and logged into the Roku account and connected in no time. Super easy instructions for quick setup! Works perfectly to make my television smart! We love it!

  I am happy I went ahead and bought this device. I have been wanting to ""cut the cable"". So this was an inexpensive way to dip my toe in the water. It was very easy to set up. Everything I needed was in the box. Followed the instructions. I opened my Roku account on line, then went to the TV to find the right ""source"" with my TV remote, hit select, there it was. After following Roku's on screen instructions, I started using the Roku remote immediately. I loaded some free channels. Plus, Roku is very helpful with hints through e-mail and I like that they tell you what's new. I am having a bit of time getting used to the buttons, but I think that's just because they are different from our cable remote. I end up in places I didn't intend to. But I'm sure that will pass. When I've learned more, I might even load some paid channels. My library offered Kanopy free a few days after I bought Roku  and now they are giving a course in ""cutting the cable"". How lucky can I get?

  My parents have a Roku Express, so when wanted to get a streaming device for one of my TV's, I went with this one.Positives- The actual Roku device is super tiny, so you don't have to worry about trying to make space for it.- It's super easy to install (the actual setup of the device once it's ready takes a while, but it's very simple).- Great user interface with any app that you would want, and it's constantly updating.- Great stream quality (I've personally never had any issue with poor streaming, or the stream going out).I don't really have any negatives to say.  If you're looking for a streaming device, this is the perfect one.

    Well Reported Audio/Video Sync Issues Mar an Otherwise Good Experience
  
",3.0,ACE Computing,"Reviewed in the United States August 19, 2019","









  
  
    
  My main 3 streaming applications are YouTube TV , Amazon Prime and Netflix.The setup is not all together difficult but mandating a valid credit card prior to completing setup is a little shady.  I imagine since the Roku Express is probably a loss-leader I can try to understand.My main concern is the audio/video synchronization.  Since I watch news primarily it is very annoying when the anchors' lips are not in sync with their voice.  I've tried all of the remedies provided by online support but none provide long-term resolve.  I understand this to be an issue that many folks are experiencing with both the Roku devices as well as their TCL model TV's.  Seems this may just be an issue with the current firmware.I like the product and for the money I can't really complain.By default I'm a Chromecast device user for my non-smart TV's.  They work flawlessly.  Sometimes though it's just nice to have a small remote close at hand .  Not sure yet whether or not a return for a Fire Stick is in the future since Amazon is now offering an app for YouTube TV.  Or just buy another Chromecast.

    Network Connectivity Issues After Less Than A Year
  
",2.0,E,"Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2018","









  
  
    
  UPDATE MAY 2019It stopped connecting to the router in the middle of streaming and there's nothing I can do to fix it. It's a known problem with this model apparently? Forums show others with the same issue and they seem to think it's some problem with the way the router and the roku communicate. It's not completely useless; if I bring it to a place with a connection it likes, theoretically it will work again. But for me, it's basically a brick. Wicked disappointed as this was the streaming device that works best for me (Chromecast doesn't interest me, I refuse to get appletv, and I know it's hypocritical to say in an amazon review but I hate amazons business model and refuse to get any of their electronics).I DID end up upgrading to the Roku Premiere, which was I think 10$ more? I'm beyond annoyed, but a quick internet search didn't bring up any of the same issues so I hope it works out since the express stopped working less than a year after purchase \:I did contact roku about it, and there was nothing I could do. I personally didn't want to deal with any of the warranty services because it's such a hassle and I hate phone calls, so I just bought a different model.Just what I needed has all the apps I wanted (Netflix, Hulu, YouTube) plus CrunchyRoll! Set up was easy, though I don't like that I had to sign up with a credit card. Only downside is no internet browser so if I want to watch a video stream (like twitch) I still need the computer. But I can now watch Hulu without the computer cutting internet every five minutes so I'm happy!

  I don’t understand how the Roku Express receives such a high rating on Amazon. I must have a faulty unit. It turns on, but constantly buffers or loses internet connection entirely when trying to stream. Even simply entering an app proves to be impossible from time to time. I purchased it so I could stream Spectrum TV, Hulu, Netflix... Instead of enjoying the programming, I spend my time frustratedly staring at a buffering screen, then resetting the device, only to have that cycle repeat. My internet speeds stay above 100mbps download and the Roku Express even says it has excellent signal strength when I check the connection. My parents have a Roku stick that they love, so I thought I’d give a Roku product a try; I wish I hadn’t started with the Express. It it’s not just inexpensive, it’s cheap.

  I've been a ROKU user since the VERY FIRST ROKU. The ROKU Express  feels very much like a ROKU box experience. The bundled remote is actually my favorite of the ROKU remotes. The Bluetooth high end gaming remote sucks. The bundled basic IR remote is the best, it has amazing battery life, feels good in the hand. And the buttons are silent but still click and tactile.The Roku unit itself is smaller than the remote. I have it plugged into the USB port on my TV for power. This way the unit turns completely off when my TV turns off and automatically boots on when I turn the TV on. I also like this because if you leave a ROKU unit on for too long it gets very glitchy. I have found that continuing to reboot them gives you a better user experience when its on.The 1080p picture quality is great. Netflix and Hulu streams look great on my 55"" 1080p TV. The HDMI control feature also works with my TV so if I hit the play button on the Roku remote my TV automatically switches to the ROKU's HDMI signal. Couldn't be happier!The reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is for the same cost I could get a Android TV box that can do so much more. I like ROKU and its UI is the best, but features... they are starting to get surpassed by some of the generic android tv boxes on the market.

  I have the more expensive wired version on my other t.v. Compared to that one one deficiency is that it will not turn your t.v. on and off like the other. You have to use your t.v. remote to get to the right hdmi slot then use it. It tends to be more quirky on not letting you fast forward for some reason, and have also had more problems with pausing. Over all for my spare bedroom not huge issues and worth the $50 some dollar difference. If it was on my main t.v. in living area I would want the higher quality wired one. I do love that it is tiny, and overall the picture quality is very good, and set up is very easy. It has a good wifi signal receiver.  It works in a room my firestick did not work in. It has not dropped the signal once in this week's trial. Four stars is very accurate for me. I give the wired one a 5 star.

  Nice product, but it had occasional problems with insufficient bandwidth to my router, and eventually stopped reliably seeing my router, which was 25 feet away.  Roku seems to have no customer support number, so I called a friend who is an engineer for Roku.  After much analysis, it appears that proximity to two massive 1970s stereo speakers was diminishing wireless.  (These speakers have of course big electromagnets in them, which create permanent magnets over time.)  I installed a TP-LINK N300 wifi repeater nearby, and problem solved.

  Overall, I like Roku, I now have 4 of them. 2 are TLC/Roku TV's, another is Roku Ultra and now this Roku Express (this item). What I don't like is that the remotes are different. The TLC/Roku TV's give you TV Power/Mute and Volume control. The Roku Ultra gives you TV Power/Volume control but NO mute! This Roku Express doesn't give you ANY control over the TV -- no power, no volume, no mute. I have to believe that it isn't THAT much more expensive to have just one version of the remote control to manufacture rather than screwing around with all these different versions.. I mean are we talking pennies? This must be Roku ""marketing"" driving this decision -- and frankly, it's very annoying.Take a very careful look at the Roku version you buy before you pull the trigger.

Need to type in your username and password? You can use your phone to type it out instead of the annoying on-screen keyboard. Absolutely my favorite part is that you can stream the sound through your phone/headphones- up to 3 devices can do it at the same time!

  Other than the Roku loading App's I do not want on its own, it was pretty decent for the first 4 months.  Then one day it wouldnt stream from the internet claiming poor wi-fi.  The built in signal strength meters showed 1 ""bar"" for each of the 3 wifi routers I have in the house, including the primary router which was 30 feet away.  I had to move one of the other routers, configured as a repeater, to within 10 feet of the Roku to get it to work (and then the signal meter only showed 2 ""bars"").  Note that other wireless devices such as the TV, PS3 and Android phones within a few inches of the Roku show the primary router signal as full (4 of 4  or 5 of 5 bars).  No wired internet port either so its wifi or nothing. The Express is out of warranty (90 days). I dont buy them normally and didnt here either but I recommend anyone buying one of these get an extended warranty. Looks like the Amazon offered one is only about half a buck per year.

Roku has ZERO customer service- unless you buy one of their more expensive products you don’t qualify to talk to a person for help they only send you the same list of troubleshooting moves that do not work. Also I found out by reading forums that this has happened to lots of other folks and just seems to be part of the risk you take going with a Roku. It’s true, I am a scorned customer and my review is biased- I know happy Roku users, but Apple comes with a warranty and customer service. I’ll never stray again.

  I upgraded from an older Amazon fire stick and decided to go with Roku because the fire stick had such a messy and ad driven home screen. I was also having a lot of lag and buffering with the fire stick. I'm so glad I switched. I've been using the Roku for about 2 months now and have only had it lag one time. It's much quicker and the home menu is personalized so I only have to see what I'm looking for when I turn it on.Update 1/27/19:After a year of great use, it literally just stopped working. It wouldn't open any apps. It would either just crash and not open an app or i would get an error saying there wasn't enough memory although I hadn't downloaded any apps in half a year. I even tried deleting apps I didn't use anymore. Worked for a year i guess.

  Arrived quickly with Prime shipping.  Directions were easy to follow.  Super easy set up!  This has quick response, not any lag time.  Purchased mainly to use the Xfinity Streaming beta app, which by the way, works flawlessly.  If you are utlizing Xfinity to sign in to your HBOGo and Showtime Anytime you will need to add those channels to your lineup on Roku, as what is preloaded is HBO Now and Showtime, which I could not access.  Once you add the channels to your line up, the setup is easy - you just have to enter your activation code via computer or mobile phone.  Amazon video is an added plus, especially for Prime members.  Go ahead - buy it!  You won't be sorry!!

    Might as well buy an HDMI cord while you’re at it
  
",3.0,Alexis Norwood,"Reviewed in the United States December 30, 2018","









  
  
    
  Long story short: I installed the Roku according to instructions, but once I plugged it in I saw the screen with the dancing ROKU letters and then it would go to blue screen. I read through a bunch of troubleshooting guides and tore my hair out but the prevailing theme was “buy a new HDMI cord”. So I did, and magically the ROKU works. I got the cord for like $4.75 at Walmart so it’s not a huge deal but it’s kind of dumb that the HDMI cord that is included with the ROKU doesn’t work often enough that this is common advice, and obviously it applied in this case. But once you get it all set up, it’s awesome and you’ll love it, seriously. Good with the bad.

  Our family has used an external first generation analogue Roku device for our television in the family room for several years now. We were recently considering purchasing a whole new television because the television started displaying horizontal lines at the top of the picture display. Before rushing out to purchase a new television, I decided to get a new Roku Express, and what a great idea that was! We didn't need a new television!The Roku Express came with a small HDMI cable, a remote with batteries, a power cord, and strip of double-sided adhesive tape. After plugging in the Roku Express, connecting the HDMI, and using the adhesive tape to secure the Roku Express to the entertainment system, I powered on the television. The picture quality was great! I went through a quick and simple setup process, and I was just amazed at the definition. I was even more amazed after watching a few streams. This is a great product, and I hope others enjoy it as much as our family does!

  I bought this to use when I'm traveling. As long as you have a good connection the picture is great. If the network gets bogged down it will lower resolution on the fly to keep your show going if possible. I only use it for subscription services so I can't speak to all that it does, but I've been happy with it. It does have the dorm/hotel log in feature so no worries about connecting to networks. Comes with a micro USB wall power source and an hdmi. Interface is easy to understand and it keeps your login info saved, so if you unplug you don't have to worry about signing into everything again. Also, if you lose the remote, you can control it with your phone. It's also more responsive than any smart TV I've ever used. I got a second one to connect to one of my LG smart TVs so I didn't have to deal with input lag anymore.

  Finally cut the cable cord in exchange for Hulu+ and Hulu Live ... and I already have Netflix and Prime Video ... and don't even watch more than an hour of TV a week, however, I added these boxes to my 3 TVs in less than 15 minutes and everything works flawlessly. I now pay about $65/mo. for 200 Mbps internet and $51.99 for Hulu. Netflix is paid for by T-Mobile as a customer perk. I use Prime for the shipping benefits, so Prime Video is just an added bonus. I wish I had done this years ago when it was still cool to do. Actually, I just read the other day that like 73% of households have cable, so I'm still kind of early-ish. Meanwhile, all it took was a cheap box that can't be more than 1.5x4"" (that seems exact, I did not measure). The only thing I hate is that there are now two remotes. The Roku remote is cool and easy to use, it'd just be cool if it had universal remote features included. I ain't mad at Roku, though. Still 5-stars because you really can't go wrong with this purchase.

  This is our fourth Roku, so we're longtime fans. We bought it four months ago because our old Roku said it didn't have enough space to run YouTube. We thought that rather than get an SD card for our old player we'd buy a new Roku, since it was inexpensive and would probably load faster. Nope, no improvement in speed. Worst of all, it keeps saying that we need to delete channels to run YouTube. We now have only 5 channels left. We thought it had an SD card, but it doesn't, and there is no way to add an SD card. I've rebooted to clear memory, no luck. The forum suggests a factory restart from scratch but other users said the problem wasn't solved with a restart. Ridiculous waste of money.

The older ROKUs I can be in another room 100 ft away and the reciever will still respond, not to mention this remote no longer has the headphone jack the previous ROKUs  used to come with by default, you now have to pay premium about $99.  A bit frustrating because 7 years ago I paid $69 at Target for the ROKU2 and now in order to obtain the same quality I have to pay more.As far as the actual device goes, there is improvement, this device has quicker loads and better connectivity and in addition has better resolution overall

The picture on the Vizio is quite good and the speakers are in front so I can hear it at a lower volume.  I first ordered a Fire Stick but then learned that ROKU is the only one that has Xfinity streaming so I returned the FS and got this ROKU on sale.  it is a little slow compared to the ROKU Ultra that I later got as a gift and use on my 65"" smart TV.As an aside, some of the apps available for any streaming device are quite good.  I'm on a 30 day free trial of You Tube TV and so far it seems good enough for cutting the cord with Xfinity.  Nothing wrong with Xfinity, good service, pretty stable, and lots of channels that I don't watch.  The YT TV price is about a third of my basic Xfinity service.If you are thinking of cutting the cord to cable TV this is an inexpensive way to see if it is for you.

  My family had a Roku for years and it was great, so I finally decided to get one. This is the worst streaming experience ever. Particularly with Hulu the commercials tend to zoom in and it never goes back to normal display during the shows, so you’re always zoomed in and only seeing half of people’s faces. I’ve also had multiple channels just kick me out and stop streaming mid- show for no reason.The most frustrating part of this device is how it frequently requires the router to be reset. Again mid- show, the show has to rebuffer and then won’t resume because Roku says it’s not connected to the internet. It doesn’t matter if you restart the Roku, the only way to solve the problem is to reset your router. THIS HAPPENS MULTIPLE TIMES PER SHOW. And I have my router and modem right next to the tv, so I can see that it’s not a problem with the internet, only the Roku. It would be easier to just use an HDMI cord to stream whatever you’re watching directly from your laptop.

The remote creates double the problems since you will need both the TV's remote (or universal remote) AND the Roku remote. NO power button, NO volume buttons.Roku's a great system other than the remote issues. At first I had trouble getting it to hook up to my internet (kept giving me errors about not being able to connect to the ""local internet""), but then I looked online and found out that if I changed the channel on my router then it would work. After that, I signed into my account and my tv automatically got all the apps I had on my bedroom tv with usernames and passwords already signed in.

Would not even work right next to the router.  All the other devices I have on the network (10 or so) handle it just fine.  Have never had any devices that failed to connect and stay connected including numerous visitors devices.  I renamed the extended network and now ROKU connects and appears to stay connected.  Was a major hassle to make the adjustments, but wanted video streaming in the worst way...  I had actually started the return process on the second ROKU, then canceled it.  Of coarse, now I have to add the extended net SSID to all my portable devices.  What a pain.  Hence the 3 star rating.Original Post: After ONE night of streaming the ROKU will NOT connect to my WIFI!  Strong signal.  Finds my WiFi but will not connect.  Connectecg once to my phone hot spot then no more.  Saw the numerous reviews that reported the same issue.  Took a chance. No cigar!  Very disappointed.......  now need to send back.  What a hassle!Update, ordered replacement.  This one was WORSE!  After update did not connect at all.  I give..  no more ROKU..  Before update it connected right off.  Then to nothing.  Returning this one also.

  We just changed to Xfinity and were told that we could use this as opposed to paying for an additional box each month.  I was a little nervous... having never used anything like this I expected it to be difficult or temperamental.  However, that couldn't be further from the truth.Yes, it took some time to set it up but that's the way it would've been with anything.  Once I had it set up everything is seamless.  AND I saved some money.  I wouldn't hesitate to purchase another of these, maybe next time I'd opt for the more advanced voice-controlled remote.  Otherwise, don't think twice.

  I was having trouble streaming from Direct TV Now (buffering ALL THE TIME, no local channels, etc...). Granted, I was using a 1st generation Chromecast, but I couldn't seem to find anyone to say - hey, try a newer streaming device. Geez! All I kept getting was that the specs for all are about the same. NO!  DON'T BELIEVE THEM! Even the Direct TV Now Customer service people did not ask me what type of device I was using, was it old, etc... My own troubleshooting led me to the answer. Which was.......I decided to try Roku since Direct TV Now was giving them away as a promotion at one time (figured maybe it streams Direct TV now better than chromecast). All I can say is it has made my streaming experience 1000 times better! I love that you can sign into your various accounts and stream those too. This was a GREAT purchase for me.  It is very easy to set up. My on screen set up got hung up at the credit card part (which I really didn't want to do anyways), but I just prompted it for another 'code' and it picked up setup from there.  And I like that you don't have to use an app. It works by remote control -- that is good if you are still hooked to the traditional cable way of tv watching vs using an app to stream. Love it!

  I appreciate how small the product is. It's not a stick or anything. It requires a power source and HDMI cable (both included), but it small enough that it weighs almost nothing and it also comes with a stick strip so I was able to just stick it straight to the bottom lip of the TV. You basically can't even tell it's there.The set up was minimal; typical for setting up a roku and a lot less time if you have multiple roku's in your house. It synced up the apps I keep on my other devices without me having to search and download.All my other roku devices are hard wired for ethernet because I don't like tying up my wifi. Without the hardwire option, I am using wifi and it's not causing a lag on my other devices, which I appreciate.

  It's much cheaper than cable. There's tons of free channels available, and it makes it convenient to watch many streaming services (Netflix, Hulu, Youtube, etc) in the same place. It quickly switches between channels with little loading time. I've never had issues with video buffering or not loading. (I'm not sure if that is related to the Roku device or my internet connection.) I've so far had this particular Roku for almost a year with no issues. I'll buy another one when this one finally dies.

  For about the last year or so, I've been readying my household for cord-cutting (carefully monitoring which channels we actually watch and which we don't). Found a suitable streaming service. Discovered that said service didn't support the 4yo Roku Stick on my wife's TV, so picked this one up. Having cut the cord, my wife's TV is now able to run at full HD without having to upgrade the STB. The cost of this unit is only about 3 months worth of HD STB rental. So, was able to upgrade my wife's TV-viewing experience *and*, in short order, start saving money feeding her TV-watching habit.

  I bought this device specifically for use with the Spectrum app.  I can use the app successfully on my iPad, but when using the roku device, the app regularly has connectivity issues, and always freezes when I try to watch movies.

",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  This product is great,  I purchased it because the roku stick was slow to respond at times and given its placement behind the TV in an HDMI port it was never fully sensitive to my switch actions.  This solves the problem, and at the price it's a good buy. It sits at a good line of sight for your remote and is quick and responsive.  However, you get what you pay for. One shortfall,  that might be a dealbreaker to others, is that the remote does not pair with your tv or soundbar like other Roku products, and when you try to pair other remotes with it this device does not come with that functionality. So if you want just one remote for everything you'll have to spend more money on the next product up.

  After 8 moths of setup, the image and sound stops streaming in cycles of ~1 sec each 30 secs!  No HDMI problem because signal to TV is stable and no HDMI error message from TV is elicited by this error.  It's like the streaming itself (Netflix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, etc) is cycling to a short silent blank screen each ~30 seconds, which is unlikely. It is a Roku device problem.  Updating system files didn't work.  Roku does work continuously streaming each movie or serial you select, but the cycle of silent black screen appears when navigating menus, Roku interface, channel streaming, etc.

  I was surprisingly pleased with Roku Express! We have Fire 4K TV sticks on our other two TVs— I wanted something a little less pricey for the spare bedroom. For our mundane viewing (Hulu, Prime, Netflix, YouTube) on our mundane TVs (Samsung’s that are between three and seven years old), I’m every bit as satisfied with Roku as with our Fire 4K sticks. The app is quite handy— I like being able to control the remote through my phone. The “privacy” feature lets you listen through your headphones, which is useful. Potential downsides: 1. the unit needs to be attached to the front of the TV. Not a big deal, but certainly a departure from the streamlined Fire sticks. 2. The remote does not have a volume control (or, if it does, I haven’t figured it out). I’m sure there are technical differences between the Fire and Roku— but as far as I’m concerned, Roku works as well as the Fire 4K— at half the price.

  Nice and simple interface clear wifi streaming. I got this because I'm blessed/cursed with a 2007 HDTV that doesn't want to expire...and this roku upgrades it to a smart HDTV. The only thing is the remote doesn't have a power button. So I recommend using the TV's USB connection that way when you turn off the TV the Roku receiver will turn off as well to prevent it from over heating. I really don't like that the favorites button logos are permanent and not customizable. And the Roku device itself really needs some vents for the heat to release inside the device because it really gets hot. Some apps stream better than others probably because of the app developer not Roku.

Although well designed for the necessary control for Roku device, but they left out control for any other device.

Maybe other Roku models, but not this one. What does that mean? When you run your microwave, you'll lose your TV signal for a few minutes. They use a similar frequency (2.4 gHz). When I used the FireStick which as 5G for a different service, I didn't have this problem because it's a different frequency. My suggestion? Get a Roku with 5G or a cable service that supports FireStick.

Working flawlessly, our internet is in the same room so no glitches with this having poor signal.  You fix the remotes other half to the tv with a self sticking tape that it comes with.  The only glitch now is if we want to move it to another tv we have to unstick the attachment, velcro would have been a better option for us.

The homepage is uncluttered, showing only the streaming services that the user has selected to be there. The remote is just the right size and is likewise easy to use; there's even a little cloth pull tab on the bottom of the remote to help with battery removal.  There aren't a lot of fancy features or additional options; it just works really well for what it is meant to do, which is streaming.

  Bought this because I didn’t wanna be caught up in the Amazon v Google feud that hinders content options. Very easy to set up and get running. So far it’s running really good. Occasional buffering but it could just be my WiFi dipping due to small interferences. But it’s not bad it gets back up going again fast. Installing was easy. My only complaint was the adhesive is not that strong. The hdmi cable and usb are heavy and make the component tip and peel the adhesive. Probably better to put it at the bottom or sides of tv. Other than that love the user interface, very easy navigation. Such a nice surprise that it comes with batteries and an hdmi. I saw people complain about the remote...but I don’t experience any issues with it.

    No Volume on Remote
  
",2.0,Dan M,"Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2019","









  
  
    
  There are a few things I don't like about this design. First and foremost, the remote does not have the usual volume controls on the side. This is a deal breaker for me. Secondly, though its small size and included double sided tape would make it ideal for sticking it on the bottom, top or side of your TV so you'd hardly notice it. However, the wires plug into the back and now you need 3 or more inches of clearance behind your TV to accommodate the wires. My 60"" Samsung is mounted on the wall so I couldn't attach the Roku at all. It's hanging by the wires under my TV right now and it's going back tomorrow.

    Love Roku Stick!!!!
  
",5.0,Natalee,"Reviewed in the United States November 16, 2018","









  
  
    
  I absolutely love my Roku stick! I even bought another one after I had one for a while! They are great substitutions for a Smart TV or cable box. The picture and sound are great, controls are super easy, and app installation is self-explanatory. I love all the features!! And the remote is simple enough for my 73 year old mom to use without problems. The only issue that we've ever had is with the Spectrum app - which is by no means the Roku stick's fault and Spectrum is entirely to blame. I highly recommend this device to anyone who is interested!!!

  We were using AppleTV in both our living room and bedroom but would constantly have issues with them. The sound would repeatedly cut out for 1-3 seconds ALL THE TIME in our main viewing area. Drove me crazy. And the one in our bedroom will just turn off and restart every. single. night. So, I was ready to try something new and I've used Roku at other people's houses before and seemed to work pretty well. Not to mention only $25!? Plugged it in and boom, ran me through the setup no problem (side note: this is not the stick and is more permanent with a sticky strip to secure to your TV). Only issue I ran into was the account setup needs to go through a device or computer and when I tried on my mobile the ""continue"" button wouldn't work but went to the comp and had no issues. It just has these nice little features like pressing the home button will automatically turn on my TV or switch from AV or other inputs to the Roku automatically. Streaming has been seamless and the stupid audio cutout is gone. Easy to switch between services and love the search that looks through all ""channels"" (apps) to find what you want to watch (no more looking things up on Google to see where I can stream). We even have our local news station that doesn't come through the digital antenna for free and live. Also wanted this so that I can get Disney+ when it comes out in November. Hope this is helpful!

Last week it started dropping the Wifi connection with the screen ending blank and sounding static. Flipping back and forth for good to nothing.

  I have used other Roku products in the past (Roku 3 and 4) with no issues. As a matter of fact, I am still using them. But the Roku Express I just bought is giving me a hard time and I have not been able to use it yet.It took me around 15 attempts to connect to my home WiFi, until it recognized and picked up the signal.Just to clarify, I was using a 2.4GHz network as the Roku rep advised me on the phone (had to call them twice), and my WiFi router is about 10 feet away from the Roku, reception based on the distance and my testing is perfect, I have 100Mbps download and 11 Mbps upload speed. I used online tools on my other mobile devices to confirm signal strength and speed where I installed the new Roku device. I have no issue using the older Roku 3 at the same spot and on the same TV where I am trying to connect the new Roku Express.After 15 tries, and connecting to the new Roku last night, I decided to connect it to another TV. When I did so, the device asked me to choose a network, as if I was in a different area. I was told by Roku reps that the network detection and setup has to be done only once not every time I switch the TV. After multiple tries, the device is still not able to connect to my WiFi.Not happy about the trouble and time I have spend on this piece of junk. I am thinking of giving Amazon or Google a try.Not a reliable device. Why would they make something that doesn't even work.

  As of ~8/20/19 my PSVue app was ""upgraded"" automatically to one that provides an even worse UX than the previous.Here's my original review:The Roku remote lacks functionality that is BASIC to any satellite or cable service, like a one-button return to previous channel, the ability to create favorite lists that filter out unused channels, and - depending on the service - the inability to read info about a program without actually loading it.That said, I don't miss paying twice as much for way less content.

  Wow.  Great little device for cheap.  Not all services stream the same.  If you have a slower connection than most then many of the video services do not stream well.  I have a 1792 Kbps Down connection and often I can only stream You Tube, Amazon Prime, and Netflix without buffering interruptions as they seem to have superior streaming technology.  I did just watched the Roku channel for a while on my slow connection without a hitch.  It is full of great old movies and some cool shows all free. I've owned for a few months and have only tried a handful of the services and apps. There is some noise that comes through and often have to move the unit around until it stops.  Seems to be a grounding issue with video cable connection to the unit.. minor annoyance.

    Remote is complete junk!
  
",2.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States October 1, 2019","









  
  
    
  After cutting the cord, I realized I needed a single system to bring together all of the viewing options I had. Unfortunately, I went with Roku! Since they had been around for a long time, and had decent reviews, I figured I couldn't go wrong. Turns out I could. While the basic streaming function is fine, the user interface just doesn't seem as intuitive as I think it should. However, without a doubt, hands down, it's the remote that is the absolute worse part of Roku. What a piece of junk. My first purchase was one of their streaming sticks, for my bedroom TV. Even at only about 7 feet from bed to TV, I have to often hit the power button twice, or even three times, to get it to turn on. Once on, the remote works for the most part, only occasionally not responding. I chalked this glitch up to the fact that the receiver stick is plugged into the back of the TV, figuring that added a small amount of inference. So, after getting used to using Roku, I decided to get this Roku Express, for the living room TV. I knew this was older technology, but with updates and all, I wasn't concerned about that. I also knew this was a more basic system than the stick, but that's what I was looking for, for that TV. What I wasn't expecting, is a remote that is practically worthless! From my chair to the TV, is about 15 feet, and that is obviously too far for their crap remote to handle. I feel like I've been transported back, to the very first days of remote controls. At best, if I aim the remote directly at the receiver, (which is mounted bottom front of the TV)  push the button(s) with concentration, and hold it still, it works 3 out of 5 times. Otherwise, aimed a little off, try and trigger a button with ease, like any other remote, or try to be on the fly with it, and it does nothing. And don't even dream of entering passwords, or other login information, from this distance, you'll go down in flames. I have to get up, walk up until I'm about 5 feet from the TV, and still it's a nightmare, every single time! Even at that distance, the remote doesn't work smoothly, either skipping button pushes, or adding two of whatever button you entered. By the time you're done, you just want to throw the remote on the floor, and stomp it into oblivion. At this point, I'm not certain what I'll do. I've gotten used to the Roku format, but I know it's only a matter of time, before I fling this junk remote against the nearest wall. And yes, I tried replacing the batteries that came with it, with brand new, name brand ones, and it made absolutely no difference.

  We have been using some earlier Roku versions for several years.  Eventually, we switched one of our TVs to a Sony Blu-Ray player to access Prime and Netflix, but were frustrated by how slowly everything loaded.  We bought this for around $30 and hooked it up.  This Roku is incredibly easy to set up and seems to be lightning fast in loading Netflix and Prime.  Great deal for the money.  We love Roku!  Note that it comes with a sticky strip to mount this to your TV, but you don't have to use it.  Ours is sitting right below the screen and you don't even notice it is there.  It basically turns your TV into a Smart TV, but with a much more robust and intuitive menu than Samsung or other Smart TVs we have used.

I should have spent the extra money and gotten the Roku Streaming Stick+ | 4K/HDR/HD Streaming Player with 4X The Wireless Range & Voice Remote with TV Power and Volume.  I have this one in my bedroom and I love it.  The volume control is on the side of the remote whereas the Roku Express does not come with a volume control. With the Roku Express you have to search and type in what you want to watch. Luckily we don't us this t.v. much because I find this to be quite annoying. The Roku Streaming Stick+ allow you press the microphone button and tell it what show you want to watch.  The Roku Express DOES do what it claims. I really miss the extra gadgets that are on the Roku Streaming Stick+.

  On the box, on the site, everywhere ""easy installation"" is touted. Everywhere. While the installation may have been easy, activation is quite another thing, because for that the Roku website must be navigated and dealt with. That took 24 hours. And I STILL can't log onto the website on one of my devices. Roku customer support is non existent. With the web site failure I tried to call the ""help"" line, where I was told by a machine that the wait time was much longer than normal. I'm experienced with Roku, ""normal"" is 45 minutes. Buy something else. This is not worth the aggravation of dealing with Roku.

  Device is great but customer service is possibly the worst I've ever encountered. Hooking up the device was very easy but I had a problem setting up a new account.

The customer service FAQ website didn't address my problem. I tried a live chat and after entering the problem as best I could (it's all buttons, none of which really described my issue), I got the reply that my problem and model didn't qualify for service with a tech and I should check customer service website. I finally found a phone number and after entering the info in the menu, I was again told I didn't qualify for help from a tech but see customer service website. I tried saying operator over and over. The recording said I needed to pick from available options and hung up on me after the second time I didn't respond to their menu. I called back and tried hitting 0 over and over. The system hung up on me much quicker. I finally discussed the issue with my son who suggested using a different device to create the account. That worked but there could at least be a suggestion regarding that option on their website or phone menu. I've had Roku for several years using my daughter's account. I love the device but I will never again recommend it due to the horrible customer service!

  My aging mother was paying 180 bucks a month for cable TV, SPECTRUM CABLE if anyone wants to know. They told her when she called to ask why it was so high, that it was because she was 'grandfathered in' on a bundle package from TIME WARNER before SPECTRUM took over the company. Which of course disgusted me. So I sought a solution. This was it. With Roku I can save her approximately 100 dollars when she nukes cable TV from the bondage of her 'grandfathered TIME WARNER..(NOW THE EVIL SPECTRUM CORPORATION) BUNDLE' which they used as an excuse to steal her blind, telling her on the phone that after December her bill would go up another 100 dollars!  Fortunately, she has a decent wifi modem, I bought this Roku after researching it for a one time fee of around 35 bucks with tax. I used my own TV to set it up which was effortless, put on all sorts of free channels with movies, documentaries, news, you name it. I was shocked at how easy it was and though, how foolish I was to have not done it sooner. I'm getting one for myself too.

  I've always been a fan of my Google Chromecast, but when we started having serious problems with connecting to them in our kids' rooms, I did my research and bought 2 of these Rokus.Our kids both have small, cheap monitors in their rooms that we originally cast to with a couple of Chromecasts. We wanted to be able to control the content easily and limit their access to media as was age appropriate. The first problem was, my wife and I both had to cast from our phones to make that work. After a while we began to have issues with the Chromecasts not showing up on our network. We tried everything, occasionally they would work, but usually they wouldn't.Finally we decided that this frustration had to end. They're a little older now, so we decided that a Roku work their own remote and access only to Netflix on a kids account was good enough. We can easily take away the remotes when it's not screen time, so no biggie.This was one of the best purchases I've ever made. These devices were SUPER easy to set up, they connect reliably and we've never had a single problem with them in the months that we've been using them. We turn on their monitors, hand them their remotes for screen time, then we're done. No hassles connecting our phones to stream, no dropped streaming connections, no frustration.If your use case scenario is anything like ours, I can't recommend these highly enough. If you don't have a smart TV, or if you want a device that's an upgrade from the built-in TV apps, this little guy is definitely a winner. 10/10, would recommend, would buy again.

    Do Not Buy This Model
  
",1.0,Ricky Bobby,"Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2019","









  
  
    
  Listen to the reviews on this model. The Express is pure junk. Within two days of owning this unit, the Wi-Fi connection stopped working. At first I thought it was a problem with my router. I did everything possible to improve the Wi-Fi signal by moving the router into the same room with the Roku, changing Wi-Fi channels, lowering signal power to cut down on interference. I soon realized that all of my other devices had no problem connecting to Wi-Fi. It was only the Roku.I returned the Express and upgraded to the Stick. I haven’t had any problems with Wi-Fi since. Plus, the Stick has the added benefit of having 5GHz. Even when the Express was working, the performance on 2.4GHz was very poor. It took 60 seconds for Netflix to display an HD image after starting a show. With the Stick, it starts playing in HD immediately.Bottom line, don’t buy the Express.

YouTube TV works on other devices that are in the same room as I have the roku set up.

  I had a Sony device with all my apps, but was anxious to upgrade with Disney Plus on the way. This Roku device was strongly recommended by a friend and wow, they were right! You can't get a better deal for this price and everything it does. Netflix, Amazon Prime, Shudder (another great reason to upgrade!), Disney Plus, Vudu, Movies Anywhere, Hulu, HBO Go, not to mention a ton of incredible free apps like the Western Channel and Shout TV; it's your one stop shop and essentially the modern cable box for modern set-ups. Yes, there's a slightly more expensive 4K version out there, but I was satisfied with an HD one for now, and can eventually upgrade. You'll love this Roku Express!

  This inexpensive, simple device will revolutionize your tv viewing and streaming experience. After discovering that our Smart TV was not that smart, we decided to look for other options. We tried the Amazon Fire Stick at first and it worked better than the Smart TV, but was still slow, locked up frequently, and had to be restarted quite a bit. As a fluke we decided to try the Roku--and are we glad we did. It is fast, smooth, and easy to use. If you want to cut the cord, this device is the way to go. Hands down, this is the best bang for your buck when it comes to streaming.

All the shows I'm interested in are on that. Some are free. I watched Stichers and was obsessed. Overall, good investment. Although i am a little confused still. I bought the Roku and then when setting it up, I was promted to call support. They made me pay $200 to activate the Roku.  When speaking to friends, they had no idea why i paid anything because they have everything i do except for free. Roku claimed that without paying the $200, i wouldn't be able to watch anything at all.  Because of that I gave 4 stars because i still don't understand why i needed to pay that.

  ROKU Express - loaded fine until ACTIVATION CODE refused to take. There was a disclaimer under the uncooperative activation code, “there is no charge for set up assistance for Roku” and a phone number shown next to the disclaimer. The customer service rep who answered said he could help with the problem but there was a service fee of $149.00 or he could provide assistance for $119.00. When I mentioned the “no Service fee for Roku setup”, he acknowledged the disclaimer and said he could offer a discount for his help. I see other reviews talking about their  Roku Scham. This obviously was a scham (traced phones number to s small town in Pennsylvania) but there was no option / all seemed to be loading promptly until I couldn’t work with the activation code. I called the ONLY phone number on the ROKU Screen and it was the scham number. There was nothing at all that suggested this was not a legitimate number. Good news: less than $20.00. Good News Continues: trash pick up tomorrow (how can ROKU not know that’s not a legitimate number? Post a no charge for help disclaimer and then first offer from Customer Service is asking for a $149.00 fee. There was NO OPTION given otherwise.

  I bought this Roku to watch Hulu in my living room. I had a previous Roku that worked fine for me up until now, but when I set this Roku up and went to watch Hulu, it showed me profiles for people named Heather and Derrick. I don't know who that is. When I log into my Hulu account on my computer, it shows my account, with a profile for me, but my Roku is logged into this other couple's account. Clearly the problem is with the Roku. I searched online and found that other people had the same problem. I reset my Roku to factory settings -- same problem. I uninstalled and reinstalled Hulu -- same problem. I checked my first Roku -- same problem. I went to the website, and there is no way to change the Hulu account you are logged into. Apparently because I bought a Roku express I am not entitled to any customer service, even though the problem is clearly with my Roku account, not with the device. I went on Twitter for support. I had to post twice to get a response, and then got a few replies that did not address my question before going silent. Worst experience with a company in a long time. I will be disabling my Roku account and will stop using both of them.

  I purchase this unit to replace my aging 1st gen Roku device.  So far, I've had mixed results with this unit.  It tends to respond slowly to input from the remote and overheats after extended use.  Overheating?  I didn't even know it was possible until the warning popped up on my TV.  I think the unit had been running for about 45 min. when I got the notice.  After some online searching, I found that others have had the same problem.  Ironically, Roku attributes nearly ALL overheating issues to environmental conditions outside their control which influence their device...i.e. sitting on a hot surface, sitting on a hot device, sitting in the sun, etc.  Heat, heat, heat.  I live along the coast of WA; I don't even know what heat is!

It was easy to set up and use, and it does stream a wide variety of content well,  However Roku did a poor job of releasing the upgraded player, providing no information on how to identify the newer model or where and how to buy it.  Keeping the same exact name as the older model was confusing, and phone support from Roku is almost non existent.  Also I am getting fed up with all of the one capability devices out there.  I would ditch them all if there was one device that supported all of the streaming services I wanted to use, and also had a bluray player, and OTA receiver and recorder, and perhaps a better way to share media from other sources.  The fact that I had to break down and add yet one more single use device to my system really frustrates me.

Before returning I tried plugging the USB into a wall plug adapter and that solved the problem.  My TV is a 15 year old 61"" Samsung so maybe it doesn't output as much power as needed for the new version, so cant be sure.

  The storage on this device is either extremely limited or functions so poorly that is results in similar effects.Constantly I find myself selecting previously used channels only for it to tell me that I don't have enough memory to run the already installed channel. It states that I need to delete other channels to make room for my already installed channels. Yet that will never fix the issue. The channel itself needs to be removed and installed on almost every single use of the channel. It is not specific to any one channel.I have 3 or 4 Roku devices currently in operation and have used quite a bit more and have never run into this issue on any of them.

    Overheats and Does Not Work
  
",1.0,Mary Spencer Cain,"Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this Roku Express about 7 months ago. It worked great for the first 5 months, however I am no longer using the it as it continued to overheat and not work (shows error message for all apps). At first this issue was once every 2 weeks, then it would happen every time I sat down to watch TV. I would return the product, however it worked for 5 months so I was way out of my return window. I ended up buying a Roku Streaming Stick about 5 weeks ago to replace it, and also had the same issues (overheating and not working - see review for that product as well). Before this I was a huge Roku fan. I bought a Roku 3 several years ago and still have it because it works great! However when I wanted to get Rokus for my other TV, I have been very disappointed. At this point I have ordered an Apply TV. The reviews are better and while it cost more, the amount of money I have spent on Roku products is more than the Apple TV cost (so now I wish I had originally done that initially). You could also look into Amazon products, however I do not personally own any of those.

  As a streaming product the ROKU express is a good product, however, what you don't know is that ROKU provides ZERO customer support for this particular product. The more expensive one's are covered but not the Express. Plus you only have 30 days to return the product to Amazon, not ROKU. No website support (other than FAQ's that probably don't fit your needs), No online chat, No call in number, ZIP!I liked the product when it functioned correctly, but this was a bit of an eye opener. Hope that if yours has problems, it's before the one year return (at their discretion).

  Purchased this for my daughter's room. The Roku was very easy to set up. It has a phone app where I can watch what she is watching and can control it within the app. I was able to easily add all our streaming services and roku has their own. Parental controls were very easy to set up as well. The remote has buttons for the main streaming services so you dont need to scroll through to select one. Just hit the button and it loads. the only thing this remote doesnt have is the voice activation but she doesn't need it. I highly recommend the roku if you don't have cable.

  So SO SO SO User friendly-I love this so much better than fire stick. I love the search feature on the main screen, you just search for whatever you want to watch, then it gives you a list of where the program/movie is available. (Netflix, CBS, etc) and if you have to pay for it or if it’s available with what you have. Saves so much time so you don’t have to go into each app and search each one individually for a certain program.My 4 year old knows how to use this extremely well. She taught my parents how to use the roku. That’s how user friendly it is. I have a roku TV, a stick, and express. And plan on getting more.

  This is my third ROKU but my first Express  (plus I set them up for friends).  It works great, gives me all the channels I want to watch. Was very easy to setup and has a small footprint. The reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I didn't realize it didn't have a headphone jack in the remote. I didn't see anything in the comparison charts that it wasn't available and I wouldn't have purchased it had I known it didn't have the jack. Also I don't like that it doesn't have an Amazon Prime button on the remote.  Too bad you can't program other remotes I already have to work with this ROKU.

  I had always assumed because Roku was older they wouldn't be as high quality as the competition, but I was very wrong. this thing is great and fast.I bought this after discovering it could be used for live TV if you have Spectrum. You just download an app, and you have live TV. Much better than paying $10 per month for a Set Top Box. It also has most streaming services available, so it's a good all-in-one. The only thing it's missing is a casting option (like Chromecast).The remote took a little getting used to, specifically the back function (I keep hitting the circular arrow), but it's pretty basic.

  I've used other Roku devices (currently have a Roku TCL TV, an older Roku stick, Roku 2, 3...) This thing is way faster. The enclosure is a little cheap and it uses a IR instead of an RF remote like the sticks do (which is my preference, but I suppose IR is better for people using universal remotes). Performance though earns this thing a 5 star. The remote is a little flatter than the rounded remotes from before, but I like it. It is a little more stable when you sit it down and feels good in the hand. Otherwise it's the same Roku experience anyone who's used these before has come to expect. Apps like Youtube which always seem to be a bit clunky are actually very usable on this thing.

  The biggest downside with the Roku is that it doesn't have a Twitch streaming app, so if you want to watch Twitch on your television you'll need to look elsewhere. It has most everything else though. I got one of these for my mom as well, and her biggest complaint was that you have to give Roku your credit card information in order to set up the device, even if you don't plan on ordering/renting from Roku's own store of content and that's worth being aware of.Otherwise, have had no issues with it. Works great and has support for most streaming services aside from Twitch.

I need my sleep. I need my sanity. I will never ever ever being buying a Roku ever again after realizing they would stoop so low as forcing me to rebuy their product every time the batteries run out.

  Incredibly easy to set up--it took me all of ten minutes, including hooking up the unit, connecting to wi-fi, registering and selecting initial channels.I've only had it a few days, but already am impressed with the broad selection of programming:  everything from free movies, TV shows/channels, documentaries and paid services from the big names that you all know.  There are commercials on much of the free content, but you'd expect as much when you get something for free.  They aren't too intrusive and the service lets you know how many there are in the break (if you remember commercial TV, you'll know you can take advantage of this knowledge).Highly recommend--for less than $30, it makes it an easy choice to cut the incredibly expensive cable, especially if you're more of a surfer and not addicted to particular programs.

  A Roku was recommended to me when Netflix stopped playing through my Nintendo Wii. It was super easy to set up, and because a Hulu subscription was so inexpensive (I chose the $6 plan with commercials), I tried that free for a month then signed up. There have been no problems using the Roku device. Sometimes the picture quality comes in a little blurred for a moment, but I think that might have more to do with my internet provider. The only annoyance is that when I'm looking up something on Netflix, it's constantly playing previews and will start the show or movie without me choosing that option. I'm not sure if I can turn off that feature, or if it's Roku specific.

  The screen set-up is much simpler and easier to navigate than the Fire Stick.  You have the apps that you want on it and can set the background screen.  I do not like that they change the background for various seasons and you have to change it back.  There should be an option if you want to see the newest seasonal backgrounds.The streaming is faster than the Fire Stick as well.  It doesn't have all the extra stuff on it that others may enjoy but I do not.  I do not need a most recently visited apps line as they already show first on the screen.  You can move the apps so that the ones that you use are shown first.  Less clutter, faster service.I do love that the volume control was on the Fire Stick remote.  That would be a great feature to add to this Roku remote.  I would also like to see an option to hook up with an ethernet cord as we have too many wireless devices running at the same time.

  Amazon says this will work with my Amazon Fire Stick. I do not believe this is true. My first complaint is with the Fire Stick. It is excellent for Amazon Fire, Netflix, Philo, etc. However, you can NOT get Roku, Spectrum, or YouTube streaming TV with the Fire Stick. Bought the Roku to be able to get YouTube TV (the streaming service). It gets plugged into a different HDMI port than the Fire Stick, requiring you to switch between ports and use multiple remotes. In my opinion streaming TV is currently a mess. Amazon, Google, AT&T, Sony and others behave like a bunch of children. American greed at its finest. In my opinion it makes much better business sense to sell you their access device, and allow you to use it to access any of the streaming services for which you are willing to pay.

  I bought this Roku the last of April.  Last week I started getting messages from it that it was running hot.  My old school Roku from many years ago did this, so I was surprised this new model was doing the same.  I remove all the cables every time I am done watching tv.  I also sit the little device on a block of ice (the type used when injured playing sports, etc) wrapped in cloth when I use it.  That's how hot it gets!  I am very disappointed in this device, having it just 5 months.  Of course my window of time is up and I can't return it.  Amazon Customer Service gave me a toll free # to call Roku troubleshooting, and it sent me to a voice mailbox that was full.

  I am a long time roku user and just a few days ago, my first generation roku started having trouble streaming.  I have been using this old roku for almost 10 years!  This new roku express is amazingly fast and couldn't be easier to set up.  I was watching Hulu within 10 minutes of plugging it in.  I am highly satisfied and don't need the other bells and whistles the more expensive version offers.  Just a tip for when you travel, I like to bring my roku on vacation with me because I can continue to use the streaming services when on the road and am not stuck watching ""normal"" hotel tv channels.

  One week of using this unit it would require a reboot to connect to the wifi. Wifi was not working so great, no other issues in my home with other devices.  Then it just went down hill from there. Seemed to be really hot also.  Then last night in the middle of watching Netflix the signal was gone. Tried resetting the wifi back up. After scanning it would not find my wifi anymore. Tried private network, although I broadcast my SSID and it worked for a minute then more more. I then rebooted again and the unit never came back on. The are lights on it, it has power, but it died. Complete junk! I took it apart and found the heat sink transfer paste from a chip to a heat sink had dried up. How old is this unit that was sent to me. Now I know why it was on sale.

  I’ve used several other similar products to stream media to my televisions. Before purchasing the Roku Express, my primary streaming device was an Amazon Fire TV Stick. The Roku Express has since taken its place! I primarily use this for streaming Netflix and Amazon Video; but have also trialed DirecTV Now, Sling TV, and PlayStation Vue with it. I love the interface and have since purchased other Roku products! I was also able to beta test a new Xfinity streaming channel to reduce my cable TV expense.Although the Roku Express remote does not have the headphone jack built-in, you can use the Roku app on your smart phone with a set of headphones for private listening. This has come in handy on several occasions when watching TV while others sleep, and watching TV while there is music playing in other rooms of the house. It is by far my favorite feature!

  Wanted to have access to news programs for my office TV. Did not want to pay a monthly fee for another cable box since this TV is not used for ""entertainment.""  The Roku was easy to set up and install. Easy to use. Gives me access to the major networks news broadcasts as well as a lot of on demand TV shows. I also have access to PBS and my Prime TV. Great stuff for a one time charge under $40.00. On review had complained about the tape mounting for the Roku box. That has been improve. Pull the tab and the box is released from the tape and the tape comes off whatever it was attached to.

  The device itself works great. We have had 4 or 5 Roku devices over the years and no issues with any of them.The one gripe I have is the remote. It's absurd that they sell the exact same remote but with the ability to control your TV power and volume yet it won't work with this model. I have no issue paying more for another remote with extra features but to block it from working and force you to buy a more expensive model with features you don't need just to get that functionality on the remote is total nonsense.One other thing to mention is that the remote does not have a headphone jack anymore but using the Roku iOS/Android app you can have the volume output to your phone rather than the TV. Then just connect the headphones to your phone and you're good to go. I actually think this is a great feature over the headphone jack on the remote which seemed to drain the remote batteries really fast.

  Since we cut out cable,  we have been big fans of Roku. I have one on every TV. We love all of the apps and I haven’t missed cable one minute.  We were tired of high cost, surprises on the bill and never liking what’s on cable channels. It’s so nice to be able to watch the things you like without having to spend forever flipping through channels. You have endless selection of free tv and movies.  These are extremely easy to hook up and very reliable. I highly recommend Roku to anyone who will listen. If you have Prime or  Netflix you will love having the Roku. They can easily be moved to any TV and work great when traveling. We recently replaced an old Tv with a Roku TV and that’s just as awesome. Have had Roku for about three years and would never go back to cable.

  I bought this for a bedroom smart tv that just couldn’t stream well despite high speed dsl. Now streaming is so much easier without interruptions. If you are new to streaming, you can stream from many sources, not just Netflix, Hulu and Prime. Roku has a channel with some really fun, free movies and shows. Yes, there are a few commercials, but it’s free! Wish I could stream local news so I could get rid of the dish. We now have two TVs with a Roku. Highly recommend!

  This is an update to my previous review.  The roku stopped working.  Now I have to cycle through 7 minutes of major static interference on my TV - like it's warming up before it finally comes on.  It's loud and painful.  I can't rush in the door to watch something on my TV.  The remote does not have the same reach.  I have one of the original Roku's, and it's what made me realize that I could cancel my cable subscription.  I purchased a Fire Stick to try something different in another room.  That has not worked as well as my old Roku Stick.  I decided to try the Roku Express, but it had the same streaming problems as the Fire Stick. At first I assumed it must be the reach of my internet, but then I realized that a more distant TV has not had problems with a different Fire Stick.  So I thought I would switch the Roku Express with my Roku Stick.  Lo and behold the issues continued.  I switched them back and no problems with my Roku Stick.  I just hope that I still have the box so that I can return it.

  I'm a cord cutter and needed a device to access YouTube TV on my non-smart TV. The Roku did the trick. I particularly like how it can be powered from a USB port, so I didn't need to run another power cable to my already overcrowded outlets.The only change I would make to this product is to make the buttons programmable. I don't use some of the streaming services with physical buttons included, so it would be nice to be able to program them to use a different service that I do use frequently.

  It seems the roku's aren't like they used to be. I've used them for years and haven't had issues until about four months ago.  Three separate roku's have had issues with maintaining internet connection.

  I have Spectrum and I wanted to add a TV in a room that would be very difficult to run a box to without splitting a line and risking degradation of the signal, so in my research I found that I can stream my Spectrum off a Roku and problem solved.  I power it from my TVs USB port, it keep the wifi signal really well and was easy to install and use.  I also use it to watch Netflix on same TV.  The only issue is the lack of numbers so scrolling through the Menu to find a cable channel is a pain, but totally worth it to not have to run an extra line or pay for a cable month monthly.  Totally worth it

  I use the Roku mostly for NHL.TV and as a Plex player and it works great for both.  My only real complaint about the Roku is that it cannot preview as it fast forwards or rewinds.  It does show you how much time is left so if I'm watching a hockey game (GO KNIGHTS GO) and need to fast forward through a commercial break I know that it's going to be two minutes off the time left to play (17 minutes is pretty close for intermissions).  Some people believe that the IR only remote is a minus, but I look at it as a plus because it allows me to use my Harmony remote with the Roku.  I have also used it in our RV with the hot spot on my phone to watch hockey games while camping and it works great, just expect to burn through 1.5 GB per period.

  This is my second Roku smart stick. I cannot say enough good things about it. Literally takes less than 5 minutes to set up. Even if you are tech challenged, this is a breeze. I have also just discovered that using the Roku app has a feature for ""private listening"" so you can pair your Bluetooth headset/ear buds  and listen to your TV through them. And the whole thing has voice recognition. You don't have to buy anything else to totally enhance your watching/listening experience.  This is awesome if you have any hearing problems or just want to listen without disturbing others in your home.  You can also load your photos and music to use as your screensaver. This little Roku device is outstanding and can't be beat for the price.

  For the past year, this has been a 5 star product. However, several Roku users are experiencing issues with the ""bandwidth saver"" feature. When this feature is turned on, it is supposed to stop your Roku device after 4 hours. However, I used my Roku to fall asleep a week ago and just got notified that I've used up 70% of my monthly bandwidth. I turned on my TV and sure enough, it was still streaming. I double-checked that the bandwidth saver was turned on, and it was. I checked for updates for my device, then restarted it. I tried using it again last night. This morning, I turned on the TV and the Roku was still streaming. Unless you have unlimited bandwidth, I cannot recommend this product. This is a horrible product flaw and could end up costing you more than you paid for the device.

  The Roku is so modern with tons of channels (Netflix, Hulu, HBO, YouTube, etc). It’s easy to navigate and the picture is sharp and clean. My favorite part about the ROKU Express is the iPhone app that accompanies it. Within the app, there’s a page where you can use your phone as a remote (which I find my self preferring over the actual remote) and switch to a personal listening option where you can have the sound come from your phone instead of the TV. It’s great if you have a partner or spouse sleeping next to you.All around, I recommend the ROKU to everyone! I love it so much.

I’m glad I chose the cheaper option, will replace all my Apple TVs eventually with the Roku!Has a remote app you can download, and it is easier for me to stream photos, music, and videos from my iPhone to the Roku than the Apple TV. Super awesome.

  For anyone without a smart tv, this is a great investment! The tv in our bedroom is old but it still works perfectly, the only downside is there are no built-in apps. I couldn’t justify spending hundreds to upgrade a television we rarely use except before bed, this is where Roku comes in. We plugged the usb and hdmi cables into the back of the television and let it update, all of which took under 5 minutes. All it took was signing into our streaming accounts and we were ready to go. Definitely worth $30!

  I bought this product to replace my Apple TV and was very happy with the ease of use and the channels compatible with Roku- Netflix, Amazon, Sling, Hulu, HBO, Starz, etc. I bought 3 devices for use around my house. Since purchasing about 1.5 years ago, 2 of the 3 have gone from working perfectly one day to not working at all (can’t get past the startup screen, just keeps restarting itself) overnight without any warning. The trade off for the low price of these devices is there is almost no customer support and I have not been able to find anything to save my devices in the customer support forums. If they lasted longer, I would definitely recommend them.

  We have bother the fire stick and the Roku and like them both. I like all the extra options that the Roku has and the ability to link your Vudu accounts. They are Amazon's competition so Vudu will likely never be added but I like having access to all my purchased digital media. Short of spending $300.00 for a second Xbox this is the best option for getting the most movies and TV shows Fromm all the vendors including using movies anywhere.

  I used to have a Google Chromecast before I decided to upgrade to a Roku for my TV in the living room. I don't have cable, so I mainly watch stuff on Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime Video.The google chromecast would never work right when trying to stream something from amazon video and it became a huge pain. This device works flawlessly out of the box and thankfully is really simple to use and set up! I also really like that it has a remote that is really simple and straightforward.

  Purchased this to take the place of a Comcast / Xfinity HD Set-top box that has a reoccurring monthly rental charge.  Setup was simple enough; create an online account (required but free), add any current subscriptions that you have (Amazon, Hulu, Xfinity, etc...) and connect it to my wireless network.  Took about 5 to 10 min and I was able to watch everything from this device without any additional equipment.  It is even small and lightweight enough that I can mount it directly to the side of the TV and use the TVs' USB port to power it.

  I really like the Roku. It has a lot of apps, operates very quickly, the apps stream smoothly, and it's super easy to set up. The apps have crashed a few times but I think it has updated itself because that hasn't happened in ages. I don't like how it can overheat if you don't have it out in the open. That makes it hard to place it where you want to place it, but it works so well that it's not a huge price to pay. Oh yeah, it's also so cheap to have everything in one place. It's been a huge improvement on our tv experience.

  This was an extremely easy install and it works great with Netflix, Amazon Prime Video, Vudu, and Xfinity. My only complaint would be that the Xfinity app loads really slow, but the other apps are quick which leads me to believe that this has something to do with th Xfinity app, not Roku. Just something to know if you plan on hooking it up to your cable package. You do not have to run a coax cable to it; it loads your Xfinity account over WiFi and you can watch live tv. Overall makes me question why I spent money on an Apple TV!

  We have a pretty new Vizio flatscreen that came with streaming apps. The Netflix one regularly had issues connecting and the TV itself loses connectivity to the wifi (and refuses to reconnect) often enough to be annoying. I finally got fed up and bought one of these so we could stop trying to use the TV's apps. It stinks to have to keep an extra remote but the interface is flawless and so far no issues with losing connectivity to the wireless network. You also get a better selection of apps than would be available via the TV or a gaming system like an Xbox. Also, this came with mounting tape and an HDMI cable which were a big plus.

  The unit provides good quality streaming TV even though the Express module is limited to 2.4G.  The most annoying issue I encounter is a tendency to crash out of live events after the first 30 seconds and then fall out to the menu every 20 minutes or so. Recorded streaming programs are more reliable.  Sling is where it occurs most often because Sling is live and higher bandwidth than other providers.  5G would relieve this issue.

  I really love my Roku! Right after getting it working, I remember saying that it is ""revolutionary"" in how I now watch TV. I put it on the same level with other major advances in TV, like going from black-and-white to color, then from broadcast to cable. Roku really feels like that much of a step forward into a new way of watching TV. I watch  lot of videos on YouTube, and to now watch them on the big screen, just like watching ""normal"" TV, is really fun and I love it. It took a little figuring out the first night to get it all fully functioning as I wanted it, with the right ""channels"" and all that, but the time it took to get that all just right was minimal. Compared to how much I love it now, the set-up was absolutely nothing. It is actually very simple to set-up, and very easy to navigate, once you get used to it. Now, after a few weeks with it, it seems like how did I ever watch TV without it? It literally is that great in my opinion. So, yes, I can wholeheartedly recommend Roku to anyone! It is the best thing I have purchased in a really long time. It adds a whole new ""dimension"" to watching TV.  Jim W.

This was a quick fix ot would work and then stop again and say insufficent power. Then I try'd other outlets, the USB port on my TV nothing worked. I still had the insufficent power message, if you get this message and you try everything to fix it, and cannot find any help through the Roku website or their customer asked questions part like I couldn't. The solution is simple trash your Roku power cable it is now garbage, switch it out for a different micro USB cable, and it should work great again like mine is now.

  Bought 2 of these and they both work great! Directions were clear (which I was thankful for) and everything was there upon arrival. I have recommended to other people already.  I gave 4 stars out of 5 because of what they provide for it to attach to your tv or something else. Maybe it would stick well if the Roku is just sitting on top of the tv, but don’t expect it to stay attached to the side or bottom of your tv.  We used something of our own, that we had in the house.  Would give 5 out of 5 if they provided something useful to attach to tv, since it cannot be behind the tv (remote must be able to click on it).  Amazing amount of free movies & shows!!

  I can't really speak to the durability or long term use of the product as it just arrived yesterday and I set it up. But, following the setup instructions that came with it, I quickly got it connected to my wi-fi, linked my Hulu account and downloaded the apps I first wanted including the Spectrum app which was the reason I bought it in the first place. Rather than paying Spectrum each month for one of their boxes, the Roku box allows me to do just about everything but watch stuff I recorded on my DVR through the Spectrum app. Video quality is good and I haven't encountered any buffering or latency issues yet -- hopefully I won't either.The only issue I had was the apps didn't want to run at first. I then checked the software version (via the settings menu from the Roku Home page) on the Roku device and it was 2 major revisions behind (7 vs. 9). After it upgraded and restarted (took about 2-3 minutes to complete) all the apps started working properly.

  I love the Roku stick.  We use it daily in our home and it works great.  The picture is good and there are lots of apps.  My older devices plugged into the back of the TV and were out of sight.  The newer device sticks to the top or bottom of the TV or surface where the TV is and receives the remote signal. They are both the entry-level unit and they have the same remote.  The new format offers a light display so you know it's on.  It's nice to have the light indicator, but I prefer the device be out of sight.  They both seem to work the same, so I'm not sure why the change was made.

  I love this so much! It works *exactly* like the more expensive $45 Roku. The remote reaches from across the room, I never have connection problems and only very very rarely does it buffer. Sometimes the image quality will drastically decrease for a few seconds, but that's most likely due to WiFi connection, not the product. The app is very helpful and easy to use. The main problem I have is the night listening mode on the app, as it disconnects often, even a few feet in front of the TV with a clear view. I'm SO glad I purchased this, as it's a great cheap replacement for cable!

Anyway, this Roku is faster and better quality and it has YouTube so I can screen mirror from my phone to my tv (you couldn’t with the fire stick I had) which I really like as I watch a lot of YouTube. The roku app is neat as well, you can use your phone as a remote if you happen to loose the actual one (which is also better than the fire stick).

  I have owned this just over 2 months and also have a chromecast. Chromecast is worth 2 star, this is a full 5.  Bye bye cable! Hookup couldn't be easier, and the channel selection is massive, though many of the channels require subscriptions, there are plenty that have free offerings. I also pay for Amazon Prime and get a lot of movies and shows through there.  The YouTube app is great as well. Fast and seamless, which is odd because YouTube via Chromecast loses connection all the time.  It is very buggy and since both are owned by Google I really don't understand that but it works great on Roku.  Cancel your cable, get Amazon Prime, Youtube, Pluto, Filmrise, and Hoopla and you have pretty much everything you need.  I plan on getting an antenna for local channels but have been 2 months without it and actually haven't missed much.

Have to download an app to change the screensaver but it's basically a waste of time and reminds me of early 2000s Windows or something. Wish the remote would take over power & volume of the TV.

    Good when it works, but WiFi reception is extremely problematic
  
",2.0,Virginia K. Day,"Reviewed in the United States November 23, 2018","









  
  
    
  Bought two of these (Model # 3900R) 4 months ago and both now have lackluster WiFi reception. This is apparently a common problem with the Express, and it sounds like it might be a hardware issue or design flaw. At any rate, this is likely not usable for some who have to go through a wall or two. Even if the Roku is in the same room as the WiFi router, it may only pick up 1 bar.What's more interesting is that it didn't seem to start off this way - the problem was progressive. I suspect it's a problem associated with degradation due to heat, as the device is small and seems to not have great ability for offloading heat generated by the electronics.I'd suggest considering a higher-end model with better heat management, or perhaps wait until Roku has fixed this issue. In the meantime, I'm going to see about returning mine and replacing them with a better model.

The only thing missing is the ability to change from the Ruko device to another input, e.g. cable, DVD, etc. Pressing the Roku remote while watching cable, DVD, etc., immediately changes the input to the Roku. But changing back requires the TV remote with an input button. Minor inconvienance but it would be nice to do everything with one remote.

  My Roku worked great for a couple months and then mysteriously suffered from ""weak wireless signal"" strength indicator despite that there was no change to my wireless router. In fact, all my other wi-fi devices are fine, just Roku says ""weak wireless strength"".  I contacted Roku support and they gave me the list of troubleshooting steps (mainly reboot), which I've tried already several times. I also tried moving my wireless router around a bit (raise) to no avail. My wireless router is only about 30 feet away (wood framed house).Roku- you need to consider that perhaps *something* about the device is causing interference and poor reception of the wireless signal. I'll definitely try out the Amazon Fire Stick next time.

Once we find a good deal on Internet alone, without a bundle package, we’ll be cutting the cord all together.

  I regret purchasing the Roku Express. My cable contract had been completed and my plan was to get a digital antenna and either Roku or Firestick so I would be able to see live local channels along with some other channels that are not premium channels. Well the only way one can see local channels and others like AMC, Paramount one has to have a cable or satellite provider which leads one back having to get cable, etc. Yes, I can see past episodes of some TV shows, not all, but not live TV without paying. I would like to see what's going on in the world as life passes by. I took a chance on subscribing for Hulu with live TV and no commercials, $39.99 / month. That turned out it wasn't worth it. You can only see live channels for certain times. Ex: Fox only plays live till 11 am. Other problems with the live channels is that it keeps reloading. I went ahead and canceled the subscription. If I don't find a way to see my local channels I will be back right before purchasing the antenna and Roku, on cable. Don't purchase the Roku not worth the expense, a piece of junk. Not being able to see live TV makes me feel like I'm totally disconnected from the world.

  I've had this installed less than 24 hours and there is already a problem.  The picture enlarges to the point where only part of the image is showing.  I googled it and apparently it's been a known problem for several years.  Solutions are to set picture size on TV remote, reboot, reset, turn off and on.....  I just go back to Roku home and start again.  I would return it - and still may - but it gets the one channel I want that my Firesticks can't get.  I'll keep my four Firesticks for everything else.  Can't recommend this at all.

  first of all I cannot believe there isn’t a review that references the remote control. You would think in today’s world this remote control could sync with my TV, would have a power button and volume control. But it does not. So technically you would have to have two remote controls. One for the Roku and one for your TV. that right there is a dealbreaker for me. I’m trying to limit things in my household, not have two of what can be one. I’m sure it works great. But I won’t even get that far due to the remote control.

  If you absolutely can't afford a full size roku then this will work, but if it will be on any tv outside the room that you're router or modem is in then you will have streaming issues. The main issue with this device is that it can only get 2.4ghz wifi signals, so if you have it in a room with a kitchen in the way, or with multiple other wireless devices they will all be fighting for the same wavelengths and you'll get crappy signal. Definitely suggest getting a higher end roku device as I've never had any issues with my other devices.

  I was looking for a basic streaming device to handle Netflix, Prime Video and DirecTV Now.  So far, I'd say the stream quality is acceptable.  I can get 15-20mbs in the (master bedroom) doing a speed test on my Macbook Air, so that should be more than adequate for a regular HDTV (non-4K) signal.  The remote is very basic and a little frustrating.  The set-up menus are cumbersome.  Thankfully I don't watch much TV, and when I do, it's usually a show I intend to sit thru (vs. bouncing around channels).  I'd want to pull my hair out if I did much of that with this device.

  Update: the problem no longer exists, so now the Roku works great for me!I upgraded my old Roku 2 to this one so that I could watch cable on it. However, there seems to be a problem with Pluto TV. Frequently, it gets into a mode where it switches the broadcast to a random channel, even though the one that I want is still selected. When it does that, there is no way for me to watch the channel that I want. Half of the value of this box to me is watching Pluto TV, so I may have to ditch it.

Every YouTube video on the ROKU says to do a reboot, factory reset or check your connection I have done or tried to do all of these things and found no success as I’m still interrupted by my aforementioned issue. ROKU also has terrible customer service when it comes to this device and by terrible I mean non existent. I tried to contact them about this issue and there is no contact for this particular model only solution articles and videos for certain problems on their website. I strongly recommend buying a fire stick or chrome cast instead of this.

There are a couple of options for power supply, one being using the 110V adapter-if you use that the unit stays on 24/7 unless you unplug it, though it does go into some sort of sleep mode displaying only a picture on your screen instead of options. I had an extra USB port on my TV, so I plugged it into that so that it goes off when the TV is turned off.

  I love Roku, its easy of use, easy of installation etc.  I cheaped out on this one costing $24.00, and wished I had purchased the better one for $59.00 ~ why? The more expense one can power up & down both Roku and your TV, additionally it has a volume control on the side and lastly you can plug in a head set!  It's worth it we you don't have to mess with 2 remotes!

  Do NOT buy the Roku Express! There are two major problems with this product that many have posted complaints about. But the maker of Roku has done nothing to solve the problem although it seems like it could be corrected with an update. The first issue: it leaves a show you're watching and takes you back to the home page randomly. Second issue: it locks up (screen freezes) and goes back to home randomly. These issues happen as many as five times in a  few hours of viewing. Very annoying to have to go through the process of getting back to your show.

  This Roku has made watching tv a lot cheaper and easier.  We originally bought one for our Non-smart tv once we discontinued our cable subscription.  It made watching apps like Netflix, Amazon Prime Videos, and HBO Now so easy to pull up and enjoy.  Our Smart TV wasn't so easy, so we attached a Roku to it as well.  Which by the way is very easy to install.  Now we can access any apps with ease and very little wait time.  Before, we had to run the local antennae tv for a little while before we could push the Smart Hub button and request our streaming channels.  Since the Roku remote is so simple, we also installed one on my father-in-law's tv because he has Parkinson's Disease and gets easily confused.  So far, so good with his ability to use.

  This is way better than the streaming stick. We had a lot of issues getting the remote for the streaming stick to work - we had to mash the buttons repeatedly before anything happened.  So we traded it in for the express, and the difference is night and day. The remote works perfectly (and has great signal; it can be pointed pretty much anywhere and still work).  Additionally, the remote has a much more useful shortcut key for Amazon Video, as opposed to Google Movies like on the remote for the streaming stick.  So glad we got this!  If you're worried about where you're going to put it, it comes with double sided tape to attach it to the edge of the TV, and it's practically invisible, especially if it's up against a black background.

Any channel you can save to the Roku will play very well and the controls work just as nicely with all of them. I have three of them in my house and one in my husband's semi truck. He uses his cell phone hotspot with it.

  I bought this as a gift for my boss and he loved it! I have my own Roku devices and they stream great and are seamless. Bought this over other streaming devices because they were the first to offer 4K and at an extremely reasonable price. The number of apps is versatile and there is something for everyone. Be forewarned that many apps require subscription services.

  Absolutely love this device. I've only had it for a few days but loving it so far. I love the fact that I'm able to stream live tv from my Spectrum account with the Spectrum app on the Roku. This eliminates the need to pay an additional $10/month for another set-top box. The picture quality is amazing and the device is super easy to install and use. Highly recommend Roku to anyone looking for a great streaming device. Stream on!!!

  The device worked well for the first month. Good interface and speed. Even amazons app worked better than on a firestick. Device became useable when it would constantly scroll at the push of a button. It is impossible to find any solutions or customer support on their website. When a phone number to call support was finally found with google (not able to find on their website), the automated messaging just points to their useless website. Its a shame. I have used another roku device with out much issue for over a year.

  Takes a bit of time and hassle to set up an account and connect to your tv.  Also requires a debit card to complete the set up however it doesn’t cost anything for the free content.  Highly recommend getting a Netflix subscription with this product however there are tons of free channels if u can deal with frequent short commercials.  Needs a working hdmi port, one of my TVs has no sound coming through the hdmi port so I cant use this product without getting a converter box for hdmi to component cables.

  I like these. There are other remotes for Roku but these were the lowest price. I expected limitations on capabilities because of the low price, but they work great. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles but but does what it does admirably. I usually don't have any use for all the fancy features that so many things have that provide no real value but raise the price. I was not disappointed here. They work and the price is good.

Minor problems with the online registration.  I tried to use a computer with Windows 7 and it wouldn't update financial data.  Might have some issues with older browsers.  I ended up using an IPAD and it worked fine.  Both the HDMI cable and the power cable are way too short.  Expect to use an extension or another cable.

  The product worked for one day. When I went to try it a second day, it no longer could connect to WiFi. I thought the problem was my routers being too weak so I replaced them. Still no luck.I contacted customer support (chat only) three different times and each time they seemed very junior and inexperienced. In addition, the wait times are extremely long as they seem understaffed.  On the last occasion the representative cut me off in the middle of troubleshooting when his shift ended. I was kicked back to the 40 minute wait queue. At that point I had enough and decided to return the product. Moral of the story is to make sure you’re dealing with a company that provides customer service to back up their products. Roku does not.

    Easy Set up Good Choices
  
",5.0,Deb S.,"Reviewed in the United States October 3, 2018","









  
  
    
  We decided to try Roku after I stayed at a friend's home who had one. Although we watch very little TV, we wanted access to some and to some movies that would fit our budget. This was a great answer to our needs. We didn't have a Roku TV but it was easy to set up and we got great results once we places it close to our internet source. This might not have been an issue had we bought the slightly higher priced option so I don't consider this a negative. Overall very happy with the ease of set up and the free selections. Added plus was that I've had Amazon Prime for quite awhile and am now able to make better use of it!

",5.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States January 9, 2019","









  
  
    
  Roku offers most of the same viewing options you get with cable for a fraction of the cost.  Every room in my house has a Roku receiver and I would not go back to cable for any reason at this point.  The only issue is that you need to maintain your power cord because some android chargers are not strong enough to power the Roku receiver.  It is a great option that allows us to CHOOSE to save money while still enjoying good television!

  Don't you just love when Comcast raises the price of your small cable box?  It was originally $2.99, now it's $6.99.  Needless to say, I needed to buy one of these to see if I could replace the Comcast box.It did the trick, but will say that I wish the remote would have had the numeric options so that I could more easily change the channel.  I have to manually scroll up and down through channels, which is rough.  That's not a Roku problem, the device itself is great. I'll invest in a new universal remote and all should be good.Take that Comcast.

The only downside, which isn’t a big deal, is there’s some lag time with the xfinity app compared to the xfinity box. Only noticed because we had a huge football party and when someone walked through they were seeing what they had just watched on the tv with the xfinity box.  This was super easy to setup.

  I bought this so I could access Pure Flix without cable or satellite.  In fact, I am able to access a lot of channels, including news.  Overall, I am very happy with this device.  My only complaint is the configuration of the reset button.  It's the stick-something-through-a-pin-hole-to-press-the-button variety.  Since the ROKU is stuck to the top of the TV, and the pin hole is on the back of the ROKU, it makes it very difficult to access and reset.  I hope ROKU addresses this issue on future models.  Other than that I think this device does exactly what they say it will do.

I have decided not to buy into all the added costs at this time and doing the free channels and shows.Definitely love the feature of Continue watching so when you need to stop watching a show it will resume the next time you are ready to watch again.

  I had a Roku stick prior to this. I love this design because it sits under the TV and is small enough to carry with me when I travel or to take from room to room. The stick design broke over time because my TV's HDMI ports are in the back of the TV and the stick was constantly being stressed for the chord to reach the power outlet. The battery life on the remote is similar to any TV remote.

  This is my first experience with Roku . I was able to sync it but the streaming on my comcast live was awful!  I tried resetting it, had Comcast send me refresh signals and reset my modem . Nothing works. I noticed some Roku products are designed to work better with Comcast internet then others. I should have done more research.  It is frustrating!!!

  This was to replace an older model that had gotten ify. Would not function all the time. This one works well but apparently doesn't have much memory. If you open 3 or 4 apps then go back to say the first one, it has to reload. Takes a while. My old one which came with my subscription of Sling didn't ever do that. I could open 10 apps in a row and never wait for it to reload. Except for that, it does what I wanted it for.

  Will never purchase another Roku product again.  I loved this product for ffhree months.  I bought one for each TV in house.  And then Roku pushed out an update.  The update caused issues with Hulu playback (VOD).  I work for a tech company so findin bugs is not unusual.  But then I discovered that Roku has absolutely  no support (no tech support or customer support of any kind)!!!  It has been 3 months since this issue  began and issue with Roku Express is well documented  on Roku community posts.  DO NOT PURCHASE IF PLANNING TO USE HULU!!  Tired of hearing from so many other Roku users with same issue who also are having same issues with Express and Hulu and no resolution or communication from Roku.

  There is so much free to watch on the Roku. We’re streaming our cable through an app on roku, so we turned in the cable box and it paid for itself. I love old “feel good” television, my husband likes sci-fye and hold horror movies, there is something for everyone and a lot of channels and apps to choose from.

  Roku is perfect. I love it. I bought it for watching netflix and youtube with my normal tv. I'm using it in Turkey. Here is some situations:1) Netflix, youtube and spotify works here. But most of other channels doesnt work because of the ip address. Netflix and youtube works perfect. Spotify is a little bit slow.2) Roku adapter's input voltage is 110v but in Turkey the electric voltage is 220v. So my advice is you shouldn't use it with a simple plug converter. But the adapters output is 5v 1a. You can use a mobile phone charge adapter which is 5v instead of it. It has to be 5v. It is not necessary to be 1a. Usually they are 5v 2.1a.  It can be more than 1a. If you use the original roku usb cable, it will work.

  If you're looking to cut cable TV costs these are a welcome option. I placed these on two TV's and they are simple to install and work as advertised. The remotes are very simple and basic, so there are not a lot of short cuts that a cable remote has; and maneuvering can be awkward sometimes, but you can learn a few short cuts. My Wifi is good throughout my house, but if you have a weak signal, these may not work as well.

  This is the 3rd Roku I have earned and this is by far the fastest one I have had. It boots up super quick and is up and running in no time. The reason I gave it only 4 stars is sometimes it really stuggles to get the picture in a clear HD image. It will take a bit to get the show to load cleanly. Additionally I find that if I fast forward it takes a bit to reload the show into HD. I predominately use the Spectrum, TLC and ESPN apps with this device and have found it consistent among all 3.

  The Roku Express worked fine at first but then, a little over 3 months after we bought it, it would no longer connect to our wi-fi. All of the advice on the Roku website is the standard stuff you would find for any wi-fi problem (move it closer to the router, etc.). But the problem is with the Roku, not the router. Everything else still connects fine - laptops, cell phones, etc. I can stream Netflix from the blu ray player connected to the same TV without a problem. Having looked over the Roku support page and found nothing helpful there is a little notice at the bottom: ""Agent-assisted support is not available for your issue and/or model."" So I guess we're out of luck. Looking online, this seems to be a common problem with the Express. It just stops connecting to wifi. It was fine while it works, but I ended up paying around $10 per month that it actually worked.

  Unfortunately I bought this thinking it would work with my high end g-sync monitor's extra HDMI port. Chromecasts do, as do all other HDMI devices I own, like a digital TV tuner. I got with ASUS Support and Roku Support and they both just say it's not their problem. My monitor just says ""out of range"" which cannot be the case, as it can handle up to 1080p 180hz and it supports the newest HDCP so I know this can't be some kind of DRM block. I give up. I just stuck it on a bedroom TV instead.

    Roku over Fire stick

  Have had a fire stick for a few years, ordered the ROKU as we were moving and the fire stick remote was miss placed. Which was almost as much to replace as a new fur stick. Heard from all my friends to try Roku! 110% like it better than the fire stick! Easier hone screen, more options a breeze to set up! Highly recommend!

  Previous Roku (first generation) was dropping its signal a lot. The Roku Express is nice and fast and has a nicer interface on screen. Still the dumb arrow buttons for inputting text, but the phone app makes up for it. Sometimes the screen will go back to home randomly. I'm thinking it needs a software update so I'm giving it a little time to see if it updates.

  Once you get it activated, the Roku express works. But getting it activated is an exercise I would not wish on anyone. Why does Roku need a credit card on file just to activate this device. The answer is they DO NOT NEED a credit card on file. It  makes them another target for hackers to get your credit card information.

  Bought the firestick at the same time thanks to prime day specials. Comparing the two head to head for a few months now, I’d say get the roku over the fire stick. They’re both good but the roku operation is a little nicer, the controls work better and with less BS , and even the sounds the ROKU makes are slightly less annoying. I use them both for amazon prime video, Netflix, YouTube, and pandora. Beyond that, one may be brewer than the other but I definitely lean more towards the roku.

It may or may not work for a little while and then I go back to rebooting.It's too late to return the unit, so I'm out the money.

  I had ""basic cable"" in our bedroom until our cable company went digital and required a box.  I did not want to do that so I ordered this and LOVE it!  I don't watch a lot of TV in our bedroom, but since I already have Amazon Prime and Netflix I just watch shows and movies on them.  It was VERY easy to set up and use.  If it was up to me I would have this on our main TV too and totally get rid of cable!

It has buttons on the remote for easy access to the important apps like netflix and amazon, while offering the option still of downloading more apps from the store like xfinity beta (which lets you watch shows if you have xfinity stream), CW (free shows) and direct tv.

Once you start a fast forward, you can't come back to the original frame.  It now takes about 5 to 10 steps to get to a show you want to watch.  Added 4 buttons that take you directly to other streaming suppliers.

  I don't know what the difference is between all the different Roku products, but this one works great for me. I don't really see the point in buying the more expensive ones when this one works for what I want it to do. The receiver is really good as well. You don't have to point the remote directly at it. It picks it up very well. I'm very happy with this purchase.

  I purchased my first Roku Express in November 2017. This device was dead by May 2018. No signs of defect, just completely stopped working one day.I assumed this was a fluke so I purchased a replacement around May 2018. Now June 2019 and the second device just died as well, same as the first.I have no idea what's going on here? Why would these work flawlessly for months, and then just die? Cheap internals? No idea?We like the Roku platform but can't justify buying a third Express. Maybe it's time to switch over to Android TV completely...

  Great product without too many bells or whistles. If you're looking for a simple way to stream Netflix or Spectrum then this is the product for you. I wasn't concerned about having a remote that I could speak into like some of the other roku's offer. But if you download the app you can still plug in your headphones to your phone or listen to the TV on your phone so that you don't disturb anyone else around you. I wouldn't pay extra for the other models this one does exactly what's needed.

  This is the best way to give new life to an older TV. We could have spent hundreds on a new smart TV and recycled our 15 year old Sharp.

It's extremely simple to set up, offers a lot of variety, and is a really good value.

  We purchased this in place of renting a Spectrum cable digital converter box due to Spectrum cable in Hawaii is cutting all their old analog connections off starting midyear. The Spectrum cable digital converter box rental is around $9 per month and we can use this Roku to stream the spectrum cable app for free in place of the Spectrum cable digital converter box. Works great with all the same functions of the Spectrum cable digital converter box plus the compact design allows it to power from the TV USB port rather than a external power supply. Roku does add the external USB AC wall power adapter with cable if your TV does not have a USB port. Our spare bedroom TV is a 720p HD Plasma and this unit will do 720p and 1080p. The HD quality is perfect. I have a Roku 3 in a different room and the Roku Express (2017) units WIFI performance is better than the Roku 3 for a fraction of the price. For $29.99 I would not hesitate to replace a $9 / month Spectrum cable digital converter box with this unit if you’re already paying for the Spectrum cable digital service and have Spectrum cable WIFI. I’ll probably order a few more just because this unit is so small and does not require the external power supply, plus it out performed my Roku 3. I used 3M double sided tape to mount it to the bottom of the TV for good remote IR range. Roku does provide some double sided tape and it's too thin for mounting the unit to the bottom of the TV with good contact.

It works perfectly and brings new life to an old tv. I already pay for netflix, amazon prime, and hbo now plus other freemium channels like youtube and ABC. so there is enough content to make the roku worth it and create a second tv room.

  Bought this for personal use. I'm not from the States, but rather from Central America. Sadly, this cannot be activated without any credit card info whilst registering your product and creating a personal account to be used with. Also, since this is not being used in the States, you can't have access to all the channels advertised due to region locking. I can't even add my amazon prime account for I don't have access to the Amazon Video channel. With that being said, here are the pro and con that I've encountered so far:Pro:1- Can be used with any device HDMI compatible.2- Plays smoothly videos in 60fps on youtube, with no lag at all3- It does not overheat with use4- IPTV support (although I'm yet to try it)5- App support with any android or iOS deviceCon:1- The device cannot be turn off unless you disconnect the HDMI and the power cable.2- Requires a credit card to activate (no fees are applied, it is just for when you want to subscribe to a channel i.e crunchyroll)3- Cannot access many channels due to region locking.Anyway, if you're not from the States, you are going to be missing a lot of content and channels.

It usually happens on Sling, so may be bc of Sling or my WiFi, but it will exit out on its own in the middle of live TV.The remote is good. If it came with 4 blank app buttons that you could program to what apps you use more frequently, it would be great. Maybe come with some common app stickers to add in the box. Other that that I like the remote style and being able to use the roku app if you lose your remote.Overall, Roku is great deal for the money.

Even with the Roku placed right next to the wireless router the connection was unstable. I have a TCL Roku TV that works great and the old Roku 2 still works well, although it does not support streaming from Directv Now. I gave the product 2 stars because it did work flawlessly while it lasted. Unfortunately it is past the Amazon return window so I am out 30 bucks. I have since ordered the Roku Ultra and it's working like a charm so far.My advice would be to fork out the money and get a better quality Roku as the Roku Express isn't built to last. It will save you money in the long run.

  ROKU is a great product but I’ve encountered a known issue when using with a hotspot that ROKU hasn’t fixed for a long time now.  The box/software will only allow you to connect once to a hotspot. If your using your phone as I do, the way around this issue requires you to change the SSID of the phone and also do a network reset on the ROKU box.  The good news is that this fixes the problem every time, we’ll at least 60% of the time it works every time.  ROKU knows this problem and we await a fix... not a huge deal but a bit annoying to need to do this every time I leave the house with my phone.  It is however great that you can stream video with no other issues through a phone hotspot.

I set it up a few hours ago and it's fantastic.  So many options for free.  Perfect picture.  Love the remote.  I'm going to pick up a few more for gifts!

  I had a firestick for years,  but we utilize Sling TV and the Amazon Firestick in my opinion is not compatible with Sling. It constantly blacks out, but I had no issues on my Roku TV. Due to this, I decided to get rid of the Firestick and use the Roku stick and I am so happy we did. It works so well with Sling and we have had absolutely no issues. Set up is a breeze and Roku products are such a cost effective way to make a TV you have which is not a smart tv, smart.  Definitely recommend.

  I was having issues streaming with my smart TV so I got this to try. And it works so well! It also has an app on your phone to use in place of the remote. I've had no issues other than the adhesive strip used to hold the Roku to the TV does not work. But that's NBD. Streaming quality is great!

  So I bought this to interface with my Xfinity cable since my firestick nor chromecast supports the Xfinity app. It works great and comes with some other cool apps but, it loses my wifi connection about once a day. The only way to regain the connection is restart the router and the Roku, then it will connect.

  ROKU needs to add a better description to this product page. Because you have to attach a remote sensor for the remote to work with the TV, it is not a unit for a HOUSE with multiple TVs or if you want to take as you travel.  Get the Streaming Sticks...PLUS. ROKU CHARGES YOU $7.25 to return this model, even though they did a bad job at describing this unit.  I had to go thru 4 amazon employees and fight to not be penalized by ROKU for this screw up. Save yourself this hassle. You are Welcome.

  Great quality streaming of media - an amazing amount of media channels with many of them free - i.e. NewsOn provides access to local channels news reports - replacing each report when a new one is broadcast. Now you can sleep in and still see the morning news when you get up! more importantly, you resolve your concerns of cutting the cable because it would mean losing access to local news.Roku is great!

Also have youth next to a free-for-use plug input to hook the device up. I don't know if I thought if the thing just ran on magic, or what, but I was surprised to find these obstacles!

  Like the product itself overall and it’s screen set up but I frequently have to disconnect the cables from the tv and wall and reconnect when a black screen shows up after turning the tv on at night. It shows something about some HDMI error. I have not figured out if this is correlated to something but it is quite ANNOYING. Plus I lost remote somehow and downloaded the app that has a remote. Love this idea but the WiFi connection with this sometimes sucks terribly and doesn’t load. Overall, should have just bought another Amazon Firestick. Not worth it to try and save some money.

It has everything we need, you can customize themes and settings, and you can download all sorts of apps onto it. We're very happy with this purchase! I did also buy the 2 year warranty.

  Are usually love that Roku products but the express is worthless. It cannot detect a Wi-Fi signal unless it’s right next to your router.  I tried to use the Roku express on the television that is one room away from my router and it still can’t pick up the signal.  Even better than that, if you try to contact support or return the Roku, you get caught in an endless cycle of recorded messages and it eventually tells you to hang up and check online.

  After 10 months of infrequent use, our Roku started saying it wasn’t getting enough power and it could no longer connect to WiFi. Roku’s website says they only take returns on purchases made directly from them within 30 days.UPDATE: After contacting Roku directly, they acknowledged my unit was defective and agreed to replace it, only charging me the few dollars for return shipping. Our Roku was great when it was working, I hope the replacement unit lasts us much longer than the first one. Either way, it’s nice to see a company that cares about quality and customer service.

  This Roku I bought has been awful from the start. Half the time it will not turn on and be recognized by my Sony Flat screen tv. Also you have to point the remote right at it for it to work and it can not go behind the tv or it won’t read the signal. I have a different $60 version and it is great, however this $30 version is awful

  This was the second ROKU we have purchased. The first one (we paid much more for) is slow and takes time to connect. This one has a little in infrared bar you can place on top of, on the side, or under the tv. This is a much better ROKU than the ones without the bar.

  This is a recent purchase to upgrade my very old Roku 2(with Angry Birds) which is very slow and crashes all the time.  I plugged this into my Samsung flat screen.  I mainly use this for Sling TV and Netflix and this will occasionally crash every now and then when watching.  This is plugged in using the AC power to the USB so this should be getting enough juice to power it as I'm not sure if the USB ports from the tv can provide enough power.  Anyways, I'm very disappointed with this and will stick with Amazon Fire TV from now on(no issues with the one I have).

  This provides a wonderful alternative to cable TV and satellite service which has gotten too expensive!

The price of monthly Hulu service along with Roku's very reasonable 1 time purchase price is saving us almost $80 a month over Spectrum cable service.  There are some time lags with streaming issues occasionally, but it doesn't compare to the outages we used to have with our satellite service and sometimes cable service providers.

  Easy to set up. Works great. I was unclear about how the power situation would work, and I almost bought a dongle for it, but it comes with a usb cord that you can plug into your tv, and that supplies the power. Obviously your tv has to have a usb port, and the instructions say that not all usb ports will have enough power, but mine is working fine. You can also plug it into the wall with the adapter.Once I logged in, it has the same setup as I have on my roku tv in the other room.

It didn't even recognise any WIFI networks anymore. Today my $30 Roku is just a wired piece of plastic I can't get to work. I tried every solution online: Soft reset, Hard reset, WIFI secret screen, everything. I have to say that my router is next to my TV, so PS4 and phone get 100% signal all the time.

  Purchased a total of four of these at different times. The first 2 are still working well. The last 2  worked perfectly at first but after a few months they have lost there ability to receive a signal. You can place them on top of your router and they will report POOR SIGNAL.  Tried every reset and configuration change possible, even switched routers, no luck. They turn on , display a normal screen but indicate poor signal strength. Ever other wifi device in the house works flawlessly. Tech support is email only, I was able to have one replaced under warranty. It too has failed in the same way. Dealing with tech support through email is very time consuming and frustrating. The time wasted is more valuable than the cost of the device. So out of a total of 5 devices 3 have failed in the exact same way. Not a good performance record. Save yourself the headache don't purchase the Roku Express.

    which is about as useless as this device is

  We've had roku devices for about 4 years now - still have the old box version in our bedroom, working as well as ever. Bought this in February, it's now June and the thing is already not working. Keeps saying the power supply is weak. I've moved it to different outlets, tvs, and tried other cords - it seems that the box itself is defective. The warranty is only for 30 days, which is about as useless as this device is. Will be buying a different brand to replace it.

  Great. I own a Roku 3, Roku stick, and Roku ultra. I'm my opinion, this one is better than all of those. It's fast and responsive. The only slight negative is that you need line of sight for the remote. But it comes with a mounting strip, so it's not really a big deal.

  I always get nervous when buying electronics because I do not speak the lingo and sometimes end up with something I don't expect. This was not the case here. I got everything I needed to set it up on the spot and I am now enjoying perfectly adequate streaming. It's only been a week but it seems to be doing it's job well.

  Based on the price this is a great product.  Works perfectly.  Some models have more features but this one is all I need.  If you check out the other models carefully and be certain that the features you feel are important are included in this one, you will be happy with it.

  Love my Roku so much, bought another for 2nd TV. Roku channel (free) & others that are included offers several movies & TV shows. I also Like that you can stream live cable TV from Xfinity if you subscribe on at least 1 other TV.  Pays for itself in no time

    Replaced fire stick but not up to par.

  I bought this to replace my amazon fire that was on the fritz. I also own multiple other Roku systems, however, this one is not so good. My amazon fire stick never had any buffering issues with my WiFi (I replaced it bc it was shutting down randomly). This Roku expresss buffers constantly even though the WiFi router is less that a foot from it and no other computers or TVs are using the WiFi. The picture is pixelated 85% of the time making it frustrating to watch anything. :( very disappointed.

    Connection and picture could be better.

  We can’t get hard wired cable in the living room, so we have this next to our WiFi satellite (Orbi, which is awesome). The Roku often looses connection, though none of our other devices do (Apple TV works fine). Perhaps it could be the Spectrum app, but the Spectrum app works on other devices as well. Picture freezes, looses WiFi, often, about 70 percent of the time, the picture goes blocky like a really, really bad VHS. We are now looking for other options after having this for 6 months. It’s just too frustratingly bad. It makes me miss dial up.

  F Jones This is the absolute worst. Don't waste your money. It was impossible to watch TV with these as they kept trying to reload. I contacted my service provider and they said it was a flaw in Roku and that they new about it and said the customer can just purchase the more expensive one. Fool me once, I went with amazon fire stick=works perfectly. Go with fire stick, you won't regret it!!!!

  We bought this unit for a new TV and it worked flawlessly five minutes after we opened the box.It even came with batteries and an HDMI cable (we used another cable) and since we already have 2 other Roku units, setup was a snap.

    Works quite well as a streaming device
  
",5.0,Jessica,"Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2018","









  
  
    
  Works quite well, it allows us to use the TV in the living room to watch shows and movies together instead of separately. So, overall, very pleased with user interface, media availability and streaming smoothness. We haven't rented anything, so I can't review that feature, nor the voice activation.
