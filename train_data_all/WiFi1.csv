  Biggest pile of tech garbage in recent memory.  This product is a total fail.  I bought this to try and get slightly better signal to one of my Ring Floodlight cameras.  Placed approximately 20 feet away from the camera on the opposite side of the garage wall my Ring gets no connectivity with this extender yet connects and works almost perfectly connected directly to my router which is 3 walls away inside the house and all the way through the garage.  Embarrassing to say the least.  Returning for a refund and will just continue to use the connection to my router.

    Bandwidth impacts the router it supports, and will not deliver the advertised speeds

  Not really sure how this device works, but it seemed to slow the other traffic that were using the wireless router. Also, I bought 2, and the bandwidth and security wap version was different. Using it, insecure network messages for the WIFI were observed on one of the devices. I configured them the same as well. It must have been an older device.. but they looked the same. Both devices I updated the firmware, and made sure my configuration wasn't to blame. No matter what, one of the devices wouldn't work as secure.  WPA 1/2 vs WPA 2/3. In the end, they didn't boost our network speeds, nor improved the communication with the router.  Family didn't want to use them, so bit of a waste...

  We use a wi-fi camera in out daughter’s room to monitor her while sleeping when we are outside in the living room. The wi-fi signal in the room weakens significantly (from 100 MBPS in living room to 10 MBPS) and the camera would stop working intermittently. That’s when I decided to buy a range extender and see if it is of any help. Netgear was the name that came to mind because I have been using the Netgear k modem for a very long time and love it.The range extender was easy to power on and install. I was able to connect it to my existing wi-fi router without any problem. The wi-fi signal from the extender has the same name as the home wi-fi with “EXT” added in the end. This makes it easy to identify and connect to. Having the dual band (3\2.4 and 5 GHz) signal was very helpful. Its ben three months since I installed it and never had to reset or reconnect. In fact sometimes I turn of the modem of update the router firmware and the extender connects back to the router again without any intervention. WEP and WPA/WPA2 security protocols provide extra security and peace of mind. An extra ethernet post provided is hand to connect any wired devices. Also, the power consumption on the extender is minimal.It is definitely recommended range extender if you have areas in house that get very little or no wi-fi signal.

  Provides great coverage in my apartment. My router is about 20 feet away from my back room, which is an absolute dead zone. This extender fixed that completely. I also like that the extender can use the same passwords as your router(s). Very handy if you can't be asked to create a whole new key.The price is reasonable, and I was able to recieve it next day. I could not recommend this product enough.

  Do not buy this. Initially this worked great, after a little trouble setting it up i had a solid month of great performance. I slowly began to realize the issues, however as soon after a month i had to restart the device around 3 times a week in order to get connected. And just recently i completely lost functionality with the 2.4GHz band. i can not connect to it with my ps4, laptop or cellphone. i researched the problem and found no solid solution, only outraged customers on their support page who have not received ample help; i have tried updating it as well. i am currently attempting to return this product and buying an Asus product ( Netgear's competitors)UPDATE: looked in to returning, and who knew it would stop working just days after the warranty period is up?

    Mediocre transmit power/range, value-oriented range extender
  
",4.0 ,On Go,"Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2019","









  
  
    
  Installation with the included step-by-step instructions was very straightforward and easy to understand. 5GHz Range is weak through walls but great for line-of-sight applications. Can also be used as an access point which gives this device great flexibility. Firmware settings allow you to choose which frequency to extend and which frequencies to use as backhaul to the router. My WiFi connection was inconsistent before using this range extender, now it is very stable and maintains close to my previous max speeds of ~80 Mbps. I wish NETGEAR explained how to orient the antennas because that could help optimize the signal strength, as well as if both antennas transmit 2.4 and 5 GHz or if each antenna is dedicated to a frequency band.

  This has been completely awful for me as a working product. It was a hassle to set up and took three attempts, changing nothing in my method all three times. I followed the instructions perfectly and on my third attempt, it finally took.I had it plugged in about 15’ from my router after setting it all up and it was awful and it made my existing WiFi network even slower. For those of you that don’t know...this device creates another network to connect to. For us, connecting to it is pointless. It has helped with nothing.And then, Netflix and other streaming services struggled and constantly buffered. Even when I used an Ethernet cable directly from my router to my smart tv! As soon as I unplug the extender...everything works fine again and the speed is back to normal. This product has done COMPLETELY opposite of what it is supposed to do. It made matters worse and it’s been thrown in our junk drawer.

  This device was just what I was looking for and I was happy that since I have a Netgear wifi router, the device is also Netgear.  I had just built a new deck in the backyard and plugged in my Google Mini speaker and noticed it has some latency and short stops like buffering.... This solved the issue.  Setup was done in same room as my router, then unplugged and plugged back in at rear bedroom and I did have a new wifi network name for the new device BUT same password as the main router.

  in general, this extender was not too difficult to setup.  I tried using the WPS setup several times at different ranges, mostly in the same room where the router is with no success.  Used the web browser setup, results were flaky, with the unit showing as having an unsecured 2.4GHz line and a secured 5GHz line.  Since setting up a WiFi door bell, this wouldn't work out.  So, reset the Extender, placed within 1 foot of the router, and tried the WPS setup again.  This time worked perfectly, with both 2.4 and 5GHz lines functioning, passwords correct for the EXT connections.  Don't assume won't work, try different positions.

  The instructions that come with the device have nothing to do with how one should set this device up. The standard way is to find the device your smart phone. The iPhone will send you to the set the extender up but you must plug in the device and follow the start up directions. But going to mywifiext.net won't get you there.

  I was excited to get an extender as my modem/router/wifi-router combo unit could only be located in one room in our house, which was on one side of the house and not central to the rooms we would be needing WiFi coverage.We have several devices in our home to utilize WiFi, including our phones, AppleTV, smart plug devices, cameras, and more. So needless to say, the bandwidth requirements may have decent demand during peak times of the day, but it's not above normal usage.I'm writing this review to update you all with my experience after 6 months of ownership. The first six months the product has worked as advertised. It was easy to install, and also easy to pair with my ISP modem. The indicator lights on the extender work well and are clearly visible. I installed the device in the most central part of our home, and was still within 20 feet of our modem/router/wi-fi router combo unit. Installing the extender confirmed it had very good signal strength from the modem.Up until now the extender has served its purpose adequately, with the occasional hiccups that required a phone, laptop, or media device to reconnect to the extender. Today, all of my devices are experiencing slower network speeds, and more frequent interruptions and disconnects. Realizing Netgear offered a 90-day warranty on their product, I should've known prior to purchase that this would last that long. This was a regrettable purchase, and I encourage shoppers to look elsewhere for their WiFi coverage solutions.

  I bought this to extend my WiFi range for my outdoor cameras.  It worked ok I thought. But periodically my 2.4gz network would stop working.  I thought it was my router.  I went through 3 routers until I found out what it was.  My latest router is a Medialink AC1200. They have great support and helped me figure out that this extender was using half the bandwidth of the 2.4gz network. So instead of extending my range it was breaking it.  I finally just unplugged this and magically my 2.4gz network is working great.  Though my camera that is furthest away has small issues still.  They suggested a Power Line extender.  I will try that and see what happens.  I guess this cheap extender is the old adage. You get what you pay for.

  Last week, I bought a new Wifi Range Extender AC750 because I almost used NetGear for my home network(such as WGR614 and C3700.) Set up Netgear router and modem were very easy. They have been works very smooth and very safe. Now It's make me very sad when I waste 3 days tried to set up  wifi range extender AC750.  It's very very hard  to set up.  At first,  I added MAC address of AC750 in the access list of my Cable Modem router. After I  connected  AC750  then I found 4 stranges MAC addresses that automatic add in the access list of modem router (they have not show the name, it's only Mac address).  A little bit worry but I still be keep the strange MAC addresses in my modem router (I  think, may be the AC750 created the strange MAC addresses.).  The AC750 wifi connect to the router easy and fast but never  get the internet service.  All wireless devices (such as Kindle Fire, HD, some Roku, TV, Iphone 6, and Laptops); all them can not get the internet service by Wifi Range Extender AC750  ( I tried one by one).  I am very tired then I tried the last chance that I called to the Netgear Tech Support. Two India technicians (lady and man) didn't  help me anything. It's very sad when the man technician blamed me that he can not help me because language communication; Although I almost done exactly his requests. At the end, he gave me the support case number (41102187). I really want to use the full set of Netgear device but it's very hard. Belief, the most important thing that I lost after I called the Netgear Tech Support. I should be return this product. I am very satisfy with Netgear Modem Router so  I hope the other Netgear products should be good and easy to use like that. Thanks!At first, I'm appreciate Amazon Service to exchange the same product(AC750) then I tried to set up Netgear extender AC750. I am very surprise the second exchange product that took only ten hours to ship to my home. I am always satisfy with Amazon Service-Thanks!I tried the second Netgear range extender AC750. Everything happened same the first one. The most important I found  that this product do not open the router signal(the light off) if the base  modem router turn on the access control. Although I  added the MAC of AC750 into the access list. If the router signal of AC750 works the internet speed  is very very slow.  I'm so very sad but I have to return all the Netgear range extender AC750.One more times, I'm appreciated  to Amazon Service!!!

  Netgear used to be solid, quality, consumer-grade hardware but has been lackluster in recent experiences.  One of my small business clients has gone through three routers in a year (not a power issue...no other devices have had issues) and I've been experiencing substandard performance with this small range extender.  The room in which the device is installed is approximately 70' from the router (Netgear R6400) and signal doesn't get through reliably without an extender.  I've lately been noticing FaceTime call drops that appear to be on my end, and I have occasional video buffering (YouTube, Amazon Instant Video, Netflix).  There are iPhones, iPads, and an Xbox One that are on WiFi, but only the Xbox is streaming video - the other devices are simply surfing the web.  Victony seems to have good equipment.  I probably should've gone that route, but the Netgear was a little cheaper.

  I chose this unit over the Amazon recommended EX2700 because of its dual band capability. I opened and plugged the adapter and it took me about 2 minutes flat to have it up and running (extremely easy to set up) and the WIFI signal throughout my house has increased tremendously. The only thing to keep in mind is that this is an extender (not a repeater), so I went from having two signals on my network (2G & 5G) to having four (2G-EXT and 5G-EXT). What this really means is that you have to set up every network separately in your devices; you can even have four different passwords.

  So I know people see this product from different perspectives and it's fine. If you don't have patience, or don't know what you are doing, or get all your info from YouTube tutorials, that might be the cause of your frustration and why this product doesn't work for you. Maybe call a professional?In any case, my opinion is this product is pretty straight forward to setup if you have patience and have experience setting up even basic WiFi connections at home. It's not a professional product, so don't expect miracles.Also if you are trying to use this extender for a large house, or apartment with concrete/cinder-block walls, forget it. You definitely need more than one, to keep extending the range and you need to place each in logical location. Away from microwaves, cordless phones, security WiFi devices, etc. Also try to place it in open spaces, like hallways or rooms that aren't cluttered. It extends your current signal, it doesn't just magically make a new WiFi signal for you!If you need more than one, that is fine, some homes will require a mesh of several units to works best.

  needed a WiFi extended to provide a better Wifi signal to my Ring Doorbell. Unfortunately, the location of my router was too far from the Ring and the signal had to travel through too many walls, including the external brick wall. Because of the weak signal, I was having trouble answering rings and getting live views on my phone.I originally looked into purchasing the Ring brand Wifi extended, but it was 50 bucks and it was ONLY for Ring products. I thought it would help to have a Wifi extender to connect to all my other devices, so I scoured Amazon to find a cheaper one.I am technologically literate in many areas, but connectivity and networks are NOT one of those areas. I was concerned that I would have to hire a techy person to come help me, but surprisingly, it was very easy to set up and connect with my current AT&T Uverse router.I did run into a bit of a problem, as my Ring Doorbell was still showing a weak signal. I fiddled around with the Ring and realized that this extended had created a new network for me to connect to - it was my network name with ""-EXT"" at the end. I reconnected the Ring to THAT network - my password was the same and everything - and NOW my Ring Doorbell works PERFECT!This extender is great and does exactly what I need.I also noticed on the box that there is a phone number to call for 24/7 tech support, which is very handy to have!I highly recommend it if you just need a boost in signal to reach certain devices or reach devices that are too far away from your router.

  I paid full price $29.99.Installed easily on the first attempt using the 1-touch WPS button.  The 1-touch feature cannot be used with WEP or WPA security.  If your existing network uses WEP or WPA, you will need to manually configure this extender through your router settings.My extender is about 80 ft from the router through a couple of walls, and provides a full-bar signal in my living room where the signal had previously been very weak.You can get a free Netgear App to help determine the ideal placement, but I haven't used it.  The device worked perfectly where I wanted it on the first attempt.I've been using this for 1 month and am very pleased with it.

",3.0 ,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased this to get stronger wifi in my basement, and it works perfectly for that. Installing and setting up took me all of 3-5 minutes to get it connected to my existing router and plug it in to a place where I could get a decent wifi signal in my basement. When I originally had it plugged in as close to my router as possible for set up, I ran a speed test and got close to about 50Mbps. This confused me considering the device is supposed to go up to 750Mbps download speeds. And my internet plan is for 600Mbps. No matter where I plug it in there is absolutely nothing I can do to get over 50Mbps. Considering before in my basement if I wanted to use wifi it would normally hang out around 1-2mbps 50 is a huge increase. But I'm still disappointed having paid nearly $40 for this product and not getting what's advertised.

  The product does work but if you live in a house made of concrete, not drywall, the connection will be horrible.Initially we ordered just one and thought that it would be enough, since our house is not that big... We ended up ordering two additional extenders so we could have the desired connection. (Even so it seems to be hit and miss sometimes)But the range itself is questionable; the distance from our router to the extender had to be less than 22ft so it could work; if it was more than 22ft you’d get a red light on the “router” light on the Netgear Extender, meaning that the connection with the router was poor.Nevertheless, we ordered 3 in total, and kind of have the connection we wanted.If you live in a concrete house and want WiFi extenders, I’d recommend spend some more money to get a good extender that does what it’s supposed to do.

  Installation was simple. I set it up as 2G+2G (i.e., full speed from router to extender, and full speed from extender to remote device). Took my laptop next to where extender was. Connected the laptop to the router wifi and measured wifi speed as 20-25mbps. connected to the extender without moving the laptop and speed drops to 1-2mbps. Few more tries, sometimes I will get full 20-25mbps, many times low 1-2mbps! Connected the TV (reason I bought this thing) and streaming services will freeze and pause every now and then, even Netflix (which is rather good at working on bad wifi) gave up. I am returning this in favor of TP-Link N300 Extender (Model TL-WA855RE) that is half the price and works great (it doesn't support 5GHz channel but I dont care as it delivers full speed and range I need),

Thinking this was an isolated issue, I decided to come on here to buy a newer model with better specs; but saw some of other reviews...its not isolated. I would give this product 1 star if it wasn't for the ease of setup. Now, I still have to purchase a new extender and I'm torn because Netgear has always had a easy setup process.

In addition, I have a 50 MB/sec connection and this device advertises 750 MB/s, it should be more than enough to handle my ISP.  I ran a speed test on my local 2.4G network as well as 2.4GEXT network and even on a couple devices and  I was consistently getting only half speed at 25MB/sec when connected to 2.4GEXT.

  What this did, in effect, was replace one marginal wireless link with two slightly less marginal wireless links.  It has to use it's own SSID and password so your devices won't auto-switch between this and your router.  It is now sitting in a storage tub.  Solution was to pull some Cat 5e trough the floor into the garage, across the garage ceiling and poke it through a wall and install a TP-Link access point (with power-over-Ethernet so no additional wires were required).  It still won't auto-roam but at least there is only one wireless link, which is solid.

  First off, I have no problem with electronics, especially something as basic as a WIFI extender.  You are limited in options if a problem occurs.There are two set-up options, WPS to WPS which should work with the press of a button on the repeater and modem. Or connect to the NETGEAR with a WIFI device and run the startup from there.  *If trying one after the other be sure to factory reset between attempts*Many attempts through both methods always ended the same: all indicator lights proper, the repeater connected to the source WIFI, my device able to connect yet the signal the repeater sends out (while strong) is not connected to the internet.Over an hour on customer service to find one person willing to give any suggestions.  Still no luck.Word to the wise, if they want you to set up a service account with electronics this simple, NETGEAR expects them to break and be faulty.

  This product does indeed extend your network, but be ready for slow speeds while using it.  My wireless router is in my basement and I needed something to help out on the 2nd floor....  The range has certainly been extended, but you can totally notice when your phone/computer switches over the extended network.  Everything slows waaaaay down.... to the point that you want to switch to LTE just to get things moving, which obviously defeats the purpose.My suggestion would be to save your money and put it towards a wireless mesh system.

  I'm really surprised how easy this was to set up and well it works. My router is at the exact opposite of where I need it to be. I went from constantly losing connection to never get more than half strength if I was lucky on 5G for my laptop, even the regular connection never went near full strength and would disconnect. I thought this might help me stay connected, but I wasn't expecting full strength. It is at FULL capacity on 5G and I'm so happy.  I do have a small house ranch style house, so not sure how this will work in a larger area.Set up took about 5 minutes and was SO easy. I located my WPS button on the router so I would know where to go since I had to plug the extender on the opposite wall. So then, I plugged the extender in, waited for power, pushed the WPS on the side, light started flashing ran over to the router and pushed the WPS that was lit up. Bother router and extender flashed as they connected. I repeated to have access to 5G connection. Unplugged extender and put about halfway between router and where I use my laptop. It took a minute or so for the green lights to come on showing it was working and I was worried, but I had patience. I went to the laptop and checked connection options. Like a glowing beacon of hope, there was the option with the same name as my regular connection, but now ending in 2GEXT. I connected without any problems at all and have been loving life again.

I purchased this newer Extender because I wanted access to G5 too (the old one could not do this). The tech told me immediately that this new Extender would not work because I did not have a router.

  The extender worked fine for the few months that it worked. One day it was working, the next day it was dead. Nothing I did could make a light turn on. I verified the power outlets that I tried did in fact work. I called Netgear customer service and they did a great job helping me. They were fast and efficient. A little over-the-top on verifying and spelling everything out but that is not a negative. I was issued an RMA number and the email with instructions arrived before the phone call ended. I'm sure the return/replacement will go just fine. In the meantime, I upgraded to a Netgear Nighthawk router and now I really don't need the extender.About the extender itself: I ran a network cable to my wife's office (where the previous router signal was low) and used the extender as an access point. Set up was easy and it worked great. It worked great until the day it went it died. The extender is a little cheap feeling but the whole thing is pretty small device and most electronics are pretty light these days. If I need an extender/access-point in the future I'll probably buy a Ubiquiti UniFi. They are a little more $$ but worth it. The OPs guys at my company all use them at home. You only have to run a network cable to the device as it gets power over the network cable. Watch a YouTube video on how they work, much easier to watch a vid than type it out.

Probably the most tricky part was that the extender will appear to be working. The directions that come with it are quite good. So if you get it - and it may be that I do have a bad unit - be sure to also download your favorite signal-strength testing app (the one that comes referenced with it is out of date and no longer maintained.

So I moved it again to my bedroom upstairs and down the hall from the furthest bedroom from the router - and it has worked very well since. The guests have been able to stream movies in their room without hang-ups which they could not do at all before.  It is great because it extends both the guest network and the 5G network.  About two times in the two months that I have had it, the green lights have gone yellow and the extender has stopped working, but if we just unplug it and plug it back in, it is back up within 3 minutes.So far we are happy with it - it has lived up to its claims and has been reliable day-in and day-out for weeks at a time.

If I poked around long enough, I probably could have done it on the PC, maybe even through the Netgear app.The extender is working great right now, but Netgear really needs to simplify the setup and tighten up security on their website.

  Bought this to boost signal in home office which is about 30 feet from router located on a different floor. Speedtest without extender was 120 Mb/s  and 40 Mb/s with extender.  Contacted tech support and they said the extender was located at maximum range.  Extender description does not indicate range limitations only that it covers 1000 ft^2 which in my case , I feel  was deceptive.  I gave it 3 stars because I thought tech support was good , otherwise I would have given it 1 star.

  This product is not safe. I used it and optimum did not let the network go through.  Yes it moves fast but you won't get the internet especially from optimum because optimum wants you to buy their internet speed and this product won't let the optimum internet get through. Also note netgear is a scam that uses this device to steel your internet information like your bank's accounts apps and your personal profiles.  I went to their website and my phone had an(i) icon on it that indicated that website is not trustworthy for they can steel your personal information like I said earlier. Listen to your phone if it said the network such as netgear is untrustworthy.  Your phone would notify you about how insecure this network product is. So I went to their site(netgear) and you can see that the site was poorly setup.  And above your phone screen if their is NOT an lock icon and you see an(i) icon on the top of your screen on your phone that mean the website is not trustworthy.  Please stay away from this product.  I hope Amazon in the future would analyze these products and make sure it's safe to sell products to people. Everything you do on the internet netgear would see it if you link this product with the fake website and activate their wifi network.  I disconnected this horrific product and dumped it where it belongs. If people say this product is great I wouldn't trust them please please don't buy this.  It's a scam product. It works real fast offline but don't let it operate online with their website ok. For now on do your research online go to YouTube or Google your product before you buy.  I hope you listen.

  Okay, this device improved the wifi signal issue at my house but it is not a miracle extender.  I noticed this thing is not too good at extending signal through walls or floors. The wifi router at my house is downstairs at one end of the house and I was getting barely 1 to 2 bars at 2nd floor bedroom at the opposite end of the house sometimes cutting out. With the extender about middle of the house on the 2nd floor stairwell, I don't have the signal cutting out problem anymore and I get consistent 3 to 4 bars so that's good. However, bedrooms on the 1st floor below do not see the same result. They get 2 bars (still better or same as without the extender). I'll just have to get another one for the 1st floor that's all. All in all, I like the device - easy to set up and move it around, not too expensive, well known brand name, etc. I bought the 4-year protection for $1.21 just in case.

  Like the title states, its a good little wifi extender thats easy to install, however you are not going to get 750mbs using it as a repeater. First you should know how fast your current internet speed you are getting from your ISP, and your router. If you are using it as a repeater ( not connected directly to your router via long ethernet cable) your wifi speed will be greatly reduced. Not bad if you are using it for internet browsing on you cell phone, or streaming tv (3mbps for standard definition 25mbps for streaming in 4K). If you want to get the most out of this or any wifi extender, you will need to use it as an access point, which requires a long ethernet cable to go from your router, to the wifi extender. This will give you the best and highest wifi speed in the area this wifi extender is installed. Enjoy!

  Would have given a 5 except for the set up.  I'm now getting a strong signal throughout the entire house and hope the unit lasts a while.  The set up was, as is usual, a little vague.  The usual unexpected deviations from the instructions and problems came up as they always do with products like this.  I hate it when what I see on the screen doesn't match up with what is in the instructions.  Worked my way through it for about an hour and finally got it set up for both 2.4 and 5.0 bands.  Based on the directions, you should be able to add both bands at once, but it failed every time.  Decided to just try one, and it finally hooked up with the router.  When I checked for available wifi, I then found both bands available even though I hadn't actually asked for the second one.  Go figure....

",3.0 ,ninbroken52,"Reviewed in the United States January 10, 2017","









  
  
    
  (1/10/2017) Works great so far.Setup was actually pretty simple after I read and re-read the instructions a few times to make sure I understood what to do. First I plugged the device into an outlet in the same room as the router - as instructed. Turned on the device and waited for it to boot up and whatever. Pressed the WPS button on the router and waited a few minutes for the device to connect to the network (mighta had to press a button on the device for this as well). Once all the pretty lights were happy, I unplugged the extender, took it to the room I wanted it in, plugged it in, waited a couple minutes for the pretty lights to be happy again, then started connecting all my devices to the networks.The TV went from 49% signal strength to 100%, and the Blu-ray player went from 62% to 100%. Streaming Amazon videos and Netflix videos was a huge problem before I got this device. Now both services stream great so far on both devices.Would I trust my mom to be able to setup this device? Nope. I still have to connect her new devices to her network whenever I visit. But I'd say for the most part if you take your time, go step by step, have the WPS option on your router, and are somewhat familiar with connecting devices to your network, you should be able to get through the process. Took about 20 minutes to go from the box to 3 phones, 1 TV, a Blu-ray player, and 2 laptops connected.(3/5/2017) UPDATE: Lately I've noticed a HUGE decrease in download speeds on the WiFi Range Extender. No network changes have been made. Speeds are down across all devices. Have tested speeds using a couple apps and online services. Wifi directly through the router is considerably higher than through the extender. Router Download: ~35.00 Mbps. Extender Download: ~1.80 Mbps.

  off the bat, its really easy to hook up to your router using WPS, BUT, using the browser based website to set it up is basically out of the question. It requires internet for you to be able to load it correctly and even with internet, Netgear's support servers are so slow, the webpage times out 99% of the time. If you are using it in the configuration of putting it as another access point that is connected via ethernet, then please tell me how you did it. I have had this thing for a month and still can't set it up that way because of the aforementioned webpage problem. Still give it a 4 star cause it has some pretty good wifi signal

  Install was fairly straight forward. I am using it in access point mode, so that I don't have multiple WiFi networks for my internet, and that involved some ""advanced"" settings to be changed. However this was all handled fairly simply via the Netgear extender website but did require some Googling. Overall the signal is strong and definitely expanded my network though out my house. Where I was once getting ~20mbps (even though i have 1gbps through ATT) I am now getting a consistent ~300mbps to my iPhone 11 Pro, and for $20 that isn't a bad trade off. The only way I could get closer to my ATT advertised 1gbps would be with mesh systems that cost upwards of $400 and even then I think it would only be a slight upgrade. Highly recommended though, would give 5 stars if not for the somewhat cumbersome setup process.

  Impossible.  Hours and hours spent with the device, with techs (not Netgear techs).  Netgear asks for the serial number:  I cannot read it with close-focus glasses and a magnifying glass.  Going to the Netgear site reveals downloads that require Zip file opening.  I do not have Zip, and I am not going to buy it.  Setting up with the WPS button on the wireless router lights up the  required LEDs.  But the network extended names do not appear when the wireless system is opened on a PC.  Searched fruitlessly over and over.  This is an insult to buyers and  users.

  I have other Netgear products, and because I consider the router to be good (Nighthawk AC3000), I decided to buy this wifi extender.  The problem is that the signal from the router is inconsistent which that makes the extender to disconnect several times  ( I am tech-savvy so there's nothing to do with its channel, location or speed - I have excellent internet speed ).  The second issue is that when the extender works, its range is poor and the speed is not as fast as the product promises.  I called Netgear  and they just wasted my time.  They will claim that the problem is the customer and their product is flawless ( Haven't I learned yet that Netgear customer support is useless??).  So now I am back in a search for a decent wifi extender.  I accept recommendations if you feel like leaving some in the comments.  I do not recommend this product, or any other Netgear product.  I will be looking for a brand to replace my Negtear items (including my router and my modem).  I feel disrespected as a customer.

  We upgraded cable internet service (from 100 to ""up to 250"" Mbps) and only need about 15-20 upload/download bandwidth to get uninterrupted HD streaming video, yet I was still getting lousy wifi signal from the new router in the two-family-home apartment living room to my nearby bedroom through 2-3 sets of walls/corners (gasping at 1.5-3 Mbps and dropping intermittently during peak volume times like 6 and 10 and 11 pm, etc.) where I occasionally work from home and often stream music and video and browse multiple tabs. In despair and after cursory research into booster/repeater/extender and models ranging from ""why bother"" to ""who can afford that,"" I took a chance on this mid-priced workhorse. Hallelujah, it's exactly what was needed! Easy set-up, and I'm now getting consistent 25-30+ speeds with the old 2.4 laptop plugged into the ethernet jack and the cell connecting on the 5G ext (and with myriad devices in other rooms drawing off the shared wifi signal). This proved just the right solution to the problem - well worth the investment.

  Mostly works well and has a better signal than the old WRT54G w/DDWRT that I used to use as a repeater. It also supports simultaneous 2.4/5Ghz repeating.Only real problem that I have is that rarely it will say it's connected with a good signal but nothing connecting to it can access my network or the internet. It usually resolves itself, but it's annoying. I also don't like the silly setup system, which makes it easier to set up for the average person but actually harder for anyone experienced with network equipment.Overall, a good value and it works pretty well. I'd say it's still more reliable than the old powerline networking system that I used to have set up a few years ago.EDIT 12/15/2019:Got sick of this thing flaking out. It works fine when first plugged in, but gets into some error state and stops bridging networks or something so that anything that connects to it can't access anything or get an IP. I know it's a problem with the extender and not the signal, because the jack on the extender still has a good connection to the network.I've replaced it and will likely never use it again unless I'm desperate. I got some MOCA adapters and an old dual-band DDWRT router that I had, and set up an access point instead. It works much better and is much faster.

I've tried 2.4G and 5G with the Extender in multiple locations in my house - no improvement. Actually, when I use the Extender the wifi network performance for that device is much, much worse. With the Extender (with an all Green connection to the router) I'm getting 5-8MB download speed (w/ 5G EXT connection) and when I connect directly to the 5G wifi (not the through Extender) I get 130MB download speed. So, something isn't working right ;) The bottleneck is now somehow the Extender. In addition, the signal strength to the Device I connect to the Extender rapidly cycles from ""Poor""/Red to ""Good"" Amber, and sometimes NO Connection (at less than 15 ft away from the Extender). I've tried two completely different wifi adapters on the device I'm connecting to the Extender. So far, I don't yet see any upside to this device. It doesn't work for me. Good luck.

The extender really extended the range of my WiFi without having to pay rental fees from Verizon for their extender.And if you want you can really extend the range with an ethernet cable to a remote location in your home if you live in a palace or something.

  With or without it, my Netgear dual-band primary router put out the same secondary speed to all smartphones and PC's throughout the two-story single family home. So in short, the gizmo is useless and does nothing to improve speed. Tech support is no help either - they simply state the obvious ""this doo-dah will NOT increase your download speed - hey, I never expected that. Give me a break, I am not that of a novice. But if my hard-wired primary clocks in at 550 mbps and my 5G devices on the same floor weigh in at 250-300, I would expect this extender to prove useful on the lower floor. Did not happen. ""With or without"" the speed remained the same. So why would I spend thirty dollars?

  I am an intermediate computer user. I am in graphic design, but have no training in IT or computer science.This thing works quite well with my dual channel 5G router.However! I tried everything under the sun to get it to link up to my router using the computer. The instructions were clear on what to do. I followed them. It was so frustrating that I nearly returned it. I never called tech support.Then I tried setting it up on my iphone. It was set up with minimal fuss in less than 10 minutes. It was EASY actually. BUT! A big but here, if you are a novice with computers, routers, networks, etc, GOOD LUCK with trying to get this set up. If you are intermediate to advanced, you will have no problem but I recommend setting it up with your smart phone.This may be helpful to others. They don't explain the big picture, probably because they feel like if you are buying this router wifi signal extender, you are already computer saavy.Here is my interpretation, so maybe another dummy like me can understand.1) The device makes a new wifi to connect to. Let me explain. Say when you get on your laptop or smart phone at home where you have a router and wifi, it shows your router's default name as ""e78u64"" or maybe you renamed your connection as ""Shackles."" Maybe you see your neighbor's network and he named his ""ImAretard"" and your other neighbor's is ""Tardis"". You know the routine, you pick your network (Shackles), and you use the password printed on the router to log in your device, and it will be the one printed on the router unless you changed it yourself. It works that way to log in your smartphone, ipad, xbox, laptop, whatever it is you have that needs wifi.2) So what this litte box does (Wifi Extender) when you set it up near your router, is that is links to it but makes a new name. So if my router was called Shackles, it makes what looks like a new router in your list of wifi networks. It defaults to using your router's name and adds _EXT to it. So when I use my iphone and go to settings and hit wifi, I can connect to Shackles or Shackles_EXT. The latter acts like another router but it is in reality just the extender you are connecting to that is linked to the original router.3) So what does it all mean? Well, say my router is in the den where I hang out and use my wifi devices. I can probably connect to Shackles since the signal is strong in the same room. Now say I have a detached garage in the back yard that has been converted into a workshop or maybe a game room with a pooltable where me and the guys hang out and have some beers and maybe play xbox. Welp, I find that I can't get a good enough signal from my router in the den. Xbox is lagging big time on my online multiplayer first person shooter games. So I plug in the extender in the garage. Lo and behold I can connect to Shackles_EXT with a very strong signal and everything works great with no lag or slow connectuon.Smart people may think I'm an idiot for writing all this. I don't care. I just hope it could help someone like me who didn't understand how this damn thing worked out of the box.

  I pay for 70mbps.  I have never gotten above 40 but it's always remained around 25-30.  Several Xfinity techs have come by and I even bought a new ""stronger"" router to no avail.Then a tech said I needed an extender.  My router is in straight site to devices so I didn't think that was the cause but I got it anyway.  Was very simple to connect.  After which I tried my 2.4 and 5 mhz and not only was it slower, I noticed no real increase in strength (fair).  I tested speed test after speed test w/ different channels and locations and it's simply not an improvement.Unfortunately this did not solve my problem and I will be returning.

  It took a little while to install --  it wasn't taking at first. Finally got the laptop to recognize it. I wanted it so I could use my laptop on my patio outside my back door. My house has aluminum siding and the router is upstairs in the front of the house so it could not get the signal before.  It works, but I found that in the daytime there is slot of glare on the laptop screen from the daylight. So I can only use it in the evening or some angles of the shade.  It does help with the signal in other parts of the house, thought at times when the signal is low.  So, I will keep it. I have had it for a month or two, but haven't used in the back yard much due to the glare so it may be not long enough to give it a good review.  I will revisited this review in the future

  I live on a farm in the mountains and depend on wifi for phone service. I lose service and wifi walking out the front door, so after reading reviews on several devices, I settled on Netgear because I was familiar with the name and the price was decent. The setup is easy, although it may not pertain to the model. A box pops up, you find the networks on your router and plug in the passwords. After it pairs, you can unplug it and plug it into the room where you want the extender. You need to locate the ""EXT"" extension on your wifi choices and enter in your router password. Then, when you go into the area where the extender is, connect to the EXT wifi you set up. I synced my phone and walked out the door - no drop and full bars. I walked about fifty feet down a hill and I stayed with full or nearly full bars and my wifi phone coverage never dropped. I wish I'd bought this a year ago. If anything changes, I'll update the review but as of now, it's great and gives me coverage where I need it.

  We're using this as a remote access point rather than a range extender, and it has worked very well.  The MoCA in our TiVo Mini went bad (Minis don't do WiFi), and we didn't have a reasonable way to run Ethernet to its ""parent"" TiVo, so we put the NetGear EX3700 in to act as a remote access point.  We turned off the ""bridge"" radio because a range extender was not needed, but the EX3700 was a better value w/better reviews than AP-only solutions we were considering.  Very happy with it - easy to set up, and the Mini (which technically requires a wired connection but can't tell the difference because of the EX3700's high bandwidth & low latency) works with it without a hiccup.

  This Netgear WiFi Range Extender is so simple to set up. I needed it for WiFi and did not want to hard wire it. I attached the cable to my modem and powered it up. I checked to be sure my computer network could see the device, Went to the provided webpage, entered my security information, Powered it down, removed the cable, took it to another location in the house and plugged it in. My laptops recognized the network extender so I entered my password (which you provide), and it instantly connected. I had problems with intermittent disconnections prior to installing the extender. No such problems now. I have a 3 story home now and WiFi is accessible wherever we are in the home.  One additional note: Windows 10 would not bring up the webpage they provide for the security information so I used a different browser which you may also need to do.

  This is the first WiFi extender that I have ever purchased. Set up was a breeze and could not ask for anything easier from a plug and play scenario. I did not use the WPS setup and opted to use the browser/app set up. Purchased this to extend my WiFi to a detached garage. WiFi in the house was strong everywhere before purchasing, and we had a weak yet usable signal right outside our back door on the porch. Once setup I placed it in an outlet located on an exterior wall on our second floor. Once I stepped out the back door of the house the signal was already weak. I am guessing this is caused by some extreme interference from the walls of our house. We have a 100 yr old house with vinyl siding over shaker, and also plaster and lathe walls inside with which I am positive have many years of lead paint. Some of the walls are also drywall over the plaster/lathe. Anyway, once i placed this in the garage it had no issue grabbing the very weak signal from the house and getting WiFi. So far it has performed well with only dropping the WiFi signal a few times. For the price it is a very solid buy.

  Got this to be able to do workouts in the garage.  Its currently plugged into the exterior laundry room and I workout on the other side of the wall.  Gets great reception, however if you plan on using this for multiple products, I would recommend something a bit stronger.  For example, I was able to Facebook live or Zoom and stream music on my phone with no issues.  Added a Ring camera no issues. But when I tried to Zoom and share an online video at the same time (so we can all do the same workout video together) there is just not enough bandwidth.  But I have to say, for the price point, it does a good job.

  So far so good. I tried naming the SSIDs the same and it confused some of my devices. Worked out better for me with a different name with the _EXT on the end of the SSID.  Setup was easy and resetting it and starting over was easy too.Edit: So the SSID names threw me off because I was having some initial performance issues and renaming them helped me know what my devices connected to the (primary AP or the Extender).  After a little more research I realized that Extenders act as repeaters and you cannot change the channel in use by the Extender.  So if your primary AP is on Channel 6, the Extender will be as well, and because of that channel overlap you get interference when your device can see both the AP and Extender at the same time.  This would work best if you have a large property and want to place this on the edge of your existing coverage to send it way out into your yard.  Really the best way to go is to buy a second AP and run a cable to it from your main access point/router/switch/cable modem (whatever you have) program the same SSIDs but put them on different channels.  For 2.4G, remember you should only use channels 1,6,11, nothing in between.  For 5G keep the channel width at 20Mhz and if you are on 155 use something like 108 or or 138 instead for your second AP.

  My wifi extender was delivered yesterday. I spent 2 days trying to connect this to my xbt-7 Comcast Xfinity router/modem, with no success. I tried connecting with WPS and using the mywifiext.com website mentioned in the Quick Start manual and nothing worked. After registering the device, I looked online for a customer support phone number to see if a specialist could help. FYI - before I was provided with a support phone number, I had to enter my personal info several times before the website finally accepted it and provided me with a case number and phone number for Home Support. I called the phone number and was greeted by a ¨gate keeper¨ She asked for personal info from me AGAIN and had me on hold forever while she connected me to a ¨specialist¨. When the specialist answered, he also asked me for personal info and my case number and call back phone number. I explained my problem and he told me to use a pen or paper clip to press and hold the factory reset button for 60 seconds. While doing that, it sounded like he was snoring in my ear lol. I asked ¨what is that noise?¨ because I refused to believe that he had fallen asleep while speaking with me. Then, he said ¨hello, sir"" twice, and then mysteriously, the call was disconnected. Keep in mind, he asked me for my number and said if we were disconnected, he would call me back within 30 seconds. These were his exact words. But, of course, I did not receive a callback.So, now I have this useless wifi extender from Net Gear that just will not connect, which will be going back to Amazon ASAP for a refund. While I understand that these companies outsource their customer service to India because it's much cheaper than hiring USA personnel, this experience was absolutely ridiculous and a complete waste of my time. After the extended wait times to reach someone to assist me and getting hung up on, I refuse to call back to try to resolve this. I'll do my research on another company and try again.When they use the term ¨buyer beware¨, this is exactly what they are referring to. If you need phone support to set up this device - you will not get it.I tried to submit this review with 0 stars, but Amazon would not allow it, so I had to choose 1 star, which was not deserved. Be careful, guys. I just thought it was really strange that after entering all of my personal info into their website to obtain a case number and support contact number, that I was asked for that same info again, seems suspicious. Especially, when I'm clearly speaking with people from India, which is evident by their extremely thick accents.

  I was adding the Netgear Extender to an Apple Airport network, so WPS was not an option; the Airport Extreme base station does not have a WPS button. However, the install via web browser instructions worked, and I was able to set up the 5Gh and 2Gh Extended networks with no problems.I connect my Macbook Pro to the network with an Ethernet cable from the Extender, since there is a known problem with USB-connected peripherals causing interference with WiFi and Bluetooth with the model I have. (Thanks, Apple!) Download speed tests with the Extender ran as high as 46Mbps out of a theoretical 50, far higher than I'd ever seen when I used an Airport Express.So why my 1 Star quibble on Easy to Install? Somehow in the process, our two WiFi-connected Canon printers got lost. I'm not really network knowledgeable, and it's entirely possible that it was something I did. I THINK it was something to do with the printers being on one network branch and the computers on another, but I haven't been able to figure out how to see where the printers are on the network, so I'm not sure. (As I said, not network knowledgeable!)What I did was start over: Deleted the printers in System Preferences, set up the extended network again, added the printers.So far, so good . . .

  The Wi-Fi Extender works fine for me. I don't live in a huge house but the router is in the far room from my Roku stick and the Roku was getting a low signal. I set up the extender, which was as easy as pressing a button on the extender and a button on my router to pair them, and then I moved the extender in my bedroom, which is on the other end of the house, and now my Roku stick is getting a good signal. That proves that it's working. Wi-Fi speeds are also similar when I'm connected to the extender. My home internet is 25Mbps down and the extender gets anywhere between 22 and 25 down, depending on which band I'm connected to, because this is a dual band Wi-Fi extender. I wouldn't take a second to recommend this extender to anyone. It works!UPDATE: Here lately it's been losing connection to the router a lot.

",5.0 ,A. Anderson,"Reviewed in the United States October 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  I want to put a computer in a room that gets a poor signal.  The extender was purchased to address this weak zone without having to pull wire.I have a  Netgear 6050 router, about 4-5 years old, rated for AC750 for 2.4 and 5 GHz.  This extender matched those specs from the same company so I expected it to be easy to install, and it was.We have a  2 story wood frame house.  The router is in the basement and the location for the new computer is on the third floor on the opposite side of the house.  Internet service to the house is from Optimim at 200 mbps.Testing was done with a new LG 8X ThinQ phone.  For comparison, next to the router my new LG phone, using the Verizon speed test website I am getting about 120 to 145 mbps on 5 Ghz down and 40 to 50 up.  2.4 ghz running about 80 down and 35 up.At the weak zone, no extender, I was getting 5 ghz, about 12 to 20 down and 7-10 up.  2.4 running about 8-15 down and 5-8 up.I tested various midpoints for the extender At the best intermediate location, without extender 95 to 105 mbps up and 35 to 45 download speed on 5 Ghz.After installing the extender, testing in the weak zone, I am getting about 70 to 85 up on 5 Ghz and 30 to 40 down at the worst spot.  On 2.4 I am getting 45 to 60 up and about 20 to 25 down.The numbers can vary quite a bit from test run to test run with latency showing 10 to 20 ms from test to test, so the numbers are typical for a set of tests.  And the way I hold the phone can influence the results.I am very satisfied with the results and will be using the extender to attach the computer on the third floor.  It will be used for general purpose internet, email, virtual meetings and occasional youtube.If this were a gaming machine or running heavy media work I would pull wire to this location.

  WE bought this device as the wifi signal strength in a bedroom was insufficient for the ROKU remote to function.  Moving the rremote 5-10 ft closer established functionality so it was close. A range extender should have been the answer.  We were surprised to find it was NOT simple to set up. method one sounds simple, just press the wps button on the extender, then on the router.  Our comcast router has no wps button. So on to method #2, through a browser except we cant access a browser on the ROKU.  Also it requires you go go through a set up procedure on each and every device you want to connect to wifi through the extender.  The instructions are not written in any form of english I'm familiar with.  If your an IT pro, you might be able to make it work for you.  After 20 minutes, everyone in the family voted to send it back.  The frustration just wasnt worth it.  PS nowhere in the instruction manual was any info on how to contact customer service....yeah, we could have probably found it online, but noone was paying us for the time we were already wasting.

  I live in the county so the cell service sucks and the only wifi is satellite. The router for it has very limited range. You can sit out side the house (12 feet away from the router) with one wood wall in the way and only get two bars of wifi. With the wifi extender I now have wifi across my whole 2 1/2 acres.It was very easy to set up and use.The satellite router only outputs 2g, but sense the Netgear AC750 does both 2g and 5g I can use it withe every device I have.I wish I would have had the a long time ago. I have even told my neighbors about it .I hope it last longer then some of the other reviews.

  There were mixed reviews on this, but I still decided to go with it, as it is from Netgear. It was not too bad to install, but initial directions are a bit off. Other reviews advised on how to install. After installation, I ran various tests, but it was also when the device was by the router. After moving it to the location I wasn't to get covered, I rechecked it. And it was worse than my initial connection. And I use a couple different bandwidth tests.. I moved the device back to about 10 feet away from the router and set it up there. I only received a little more speed from that point.

  I haven't a review in a long time but wanted to drop for this.Bad internet in my house. Five users means five devices at any given time, sometimes more. First, I upgraded my router. That worked well for a while, but over the last couple of weeks the wifi signal in my family room has dropped. Don't know why, maybe it's the Christmas tree. I dunno, but it crapped big time. Router placement isn't ideal, but it's where it has to be. My roku started buffering or degrading the picture and I was using my cell's hot spot to use my laptop.  After doing the requisite reading of reviews, I settled on this extender. I've only had it a day, but wow, what a noticeable difference.Setup: Cake. My router has WPS so it was literally clicking a button on the extender and a button on my router. My only misstep in the whole process was entering my password wrong on my laptop. Could not have been easier.Signal: Got a great signal now. I spent several hours streaming Hulu on my roku. Hulu is the worst offender when my signal is low and it streamed like a pro today. Laptop is actually loading pages again and letting me do things like write this review.I'll admit this review is only after a day of use, but it's like night/day.

  I was expecting much better performance compared to my old N150, it's reach and speed is almost identical, it's price is not. I would like to note that I do not have the same issues as I do with my N150 (constant drops and having to reset and deal with the horrible set up, literally weeks wasted hunched over by my router trying to constantly reconfigure the N300 for use.)All in all stability increased, range and connection speeds were blatantly exaggerated.

  There are probably betters ones out there but more expensive for sure.  This made my Roku wifi go from a single bar of wifi signal to 5 out of 6.  If I put it closer, I could even get another bar, but it wasn't practical to get it closer.Set-up was a cinch with the WPS button.  LED indicator lights let me know if I was too far from the device or the router.  **You should know this is NOT a mesh system.  It creates a ""sub-network"" so you should use this on something that is permanently within the new sub-network like a Roku, wireless DVD player or something like that.  If you move a device in an out of the network like your cell phone, you have to manually select the new network each time, unless you totally lose the signal of the previous network - then it will find the strongest one  (probably your new sub-network). Bottom line:  it performs fine for what I need for the price I paid.

  My pole barn is 60’ from my house and at least 80-90’ from my WiFi modem. In the summer with my doors up I have a decent WiFi connection in the barn, however in the winter with the doors closed there is absolutely zero signal. I live in a Verizon dead zone out in the country so I rely on my WiFi for phone calls which works great except when I’m in my wood shop in my pole barn.  I ordered this hoping it would extend my network to my shop and I am really happy to say it works great. I plugged this in near a window facing my house and within 10mins I had excellent WiFi throughout my pole barn. I can now make WiFi phone calls in my pole barn which was a absolutely impossible before.

  To start, I have awful internet (Frontier... it’s my only option) so any improvement is a big improvement for me. This extender has allowed me to stream Netflix (and occasionally HBO) and I can normally play online video games.I won’t give five stars because it’s incredibly annoying having to log into netgear on the regular when my internet disconnects from a device in order to “set up” when I’ve already done it. Updates are a bit annoying (presently arguing with one now).Overall, I’d recommend. It makes the awful company that is Frontier slightly more tolerable.

When this extender unit didn't work, the tech tried talking me into a $200 dollar support plan so he can set up hardware and software firewalls. That was for tech support only; not the HW or SW. Problem: I already have a fully functioning firewall that he didn't  see despite having remote access to my computer.

  We've had for 2 weeks now and so far so good.  We have a very long house, with a media room upstairs on one side of the house (opposite side from our wifi router).  We were having difficulties streaming on the TV because the wifi reception was spotty being on the end of the wifi range.  After reading through the reviews, I purchased this product.  At first I tried just plugging it in and setting up wirelessly by pushing the WPS buttons, but it wouldn't connect.  I finally just opened my laptop to do it through the IP and it was done in 2 minutes (should have just done this first).  We used extender mode, and plugged it in downstairs on the other side of the house from our current router.  We still don't get a perfect signal upstairs, but it's at least one 'bar' higher and we have less ""buffering"" issues.Also, I tested the speed before and after connecting this extender, and did not lose any, surprisingly.  I went up to the media room to have a controlled area, and sat in the same spot through both tests.  My regular wifi was running about 57 mbps, and I switched to the extender and got about 56 mbps.  I just ran it now, however, while I'm sitting next to my wifi router, away from the extender, and I'm getting 65.5 mbps on my regular wifi, and about 26 mbps on the extender.

  I have this range extender for 1 day and i love it so far. My ISP router is in the front of my home so the WiFi signal gets weak in the middle and drops to the back, so this has boosted the signal tremendously. Doing my research and learned about dual band routers and so I was contemplating purchasing the Netgear N300(which is cheaper but single band) but this model has dual bands so even though it was slightly more expensive i bought it. Setup was ridiculously easy, i sent it to a friend who brought it for me so i did not get the documentation but i simply plugged my ethernet cable into the device and the setup steps through the browser was very easy. I have only one issue with the device which is why i gave it 4 stars. After plugging it in for 1 hour i realized the device gets really warm/hot. I hope this is normal, but i dont think it should be so warm. Thinking about it as i type this, the power supply and the WiFi electronics are all in one small package plugged into the outlet, so maybe that's the reason why its so warm. But it does make me wonder if i can keep this plugged in 24/7, i guess time will tell.UPDATE:July 15, 2018Two weeks ago this device stopped working just like that. I am extremely dissappointed to say the least, when i plug it in, its dead dead dead. I want to send this back and get back my money!

  I bought this booster not knowing if I was wasting my money or not. I have a cabin that had Comcast wireless internet and cable TV. Everything worked great until I decided to upgrade to  Xfinity. I was told by the technician that my wireless signal would not be as strong after upgrading. I didn’t understand the reasoning and I hoped he was wrong, turned out he wasn’t wrong. The wireless unit was placed in the same place as my older unit which was behind my living room TV. All the WiFi devices worked great near the front of the house in and near the living room. After he left I brought my iPad to the rear of the house furthest away from the WiFi unit. I had absolutely no reception. A friend told me about WiFi boosters.

  Ok, so I originally bought this for myself to expand the WiFi coverage in my house, because I spend a lot of time in the garage and it’s far away from my router, BUT last year I visited my grandparents who live in a tiny Texas town, and my phone was no signal from sprint, no phone no internet, NOTHING, I asked around and seems only people with AT&T phones, were ever able to get any kind of service, and that was extremely hit or miss, BUT, my grandparents do have internet through their cable tv service provider, my problem was, I was, and do, do a lot of work for them out in the barn that is about 100 yards from their house, so my phone wasn’t picking up the router that was inside their house. So I drove an hour home, snagged this thing out of my house, drove back, and plugged this into an outlet inside an old greenhouse/shed my grandmother keeps plants inside during the winter, it was the perfect halfway mark, now I can be inside this massive metal barn, and get fantastic internet signal inside.This extender has been inside that green house now for almost 2 years, it still works 100%, I run diagnostics on it with my app about every other month, just to make sure it’s not needing any kind of update or needs to be reset. I am very pleased with this little thing, and highly recommend it to anyone that needs to bring the internet out to the house and out to the barn so you can look for parts or videos on how to fix something, or stream music out in the barn while you weld or wrench on your next project. Makes it not so lonely in there. 😏

  Like other commentators - Set up was easy. It takes a few seconds, so be patient with both turn on and initial link set up. Had a laptop that was too slow due to connect speed (and not that far away, probably just some 'metal' wall issue). Connected the AC750 and plugged into an outlet not far from the laptop. All 'bars.' Still the factor is AC750 connection to the  originating router. Speed was not measured quantitatively, but download of a large zip fill was 'fast.' Playing youtube HD videos was seamless, no dropouts or drop in resolution. Performance went from unacceptable to very acceptable.

He volunteered to “fix” them if (my mistake #2) I gave him a few minutes to do that.  God knows what he was extracting from my computer while he proceeded to tell me horror stories about the perils of not having a firewall, and he then proceeded to enumerate the virtues of the “firewall” he was prepared to install immediately.  He asked for my address & phone number (he already had that), then displayed the plan options and prices (3 or 7 years, $400 to $700) and asked for my credit card number.Oh, geez!  At that point it (finally) dawned on my simple brain that I was potentially very vulnerable. I began quickly to disengage, and cut off power to the computer.The whole experience left me feeling foolish and shaken, and I’m returning the device because I’m not sure I’m secure with this thing inside my LAN now that it connects to my router without needing a password.

  This WiFi range extender was exactly what we needed. Easy to install following the instructions included in the box, and even easier if your router has WPS capability (our U-Verse one does). Plugged it in and had it completely ready to go in less than 10 minutes. Once I located it in the area where our WiFi had been dropping (other side of the house on the top floor), I measured the internet speed on the new extended WiFi network and it was 3x what we had been getting from our standard router. Great performance!Note: By default, this extender creates a new network with ""_2GEXT"" at the end of your main home network (and ""_5GEXT"" if you decide to utilize the dual band feature) and uses the same password as your home network. But you can create an account online and change all of these settings. You can also reduce the WiFi power output from the Extender (25%, 50%, 75%, or the default 100%) and as a result, reduce the range if you don't need it to cover a large area - very handy option to save power.

  I spent a couple few hours with my friend and I trying to installed and get this unit to work.  Wasted our time.  The unit provide only about 38 MBPS download speed only from my house 280 MBPS capable Xfinity Router.  Tried both 2G and 5G and various location in the house. All with the same slow result.  Look up phone number for Netgear on the Internet only to connect to 3rd Party scammer from India (sorry it is typical but sad).  Finally this morning I went online and chat with Amazon agents who did not know what to do and connect to Netgear technical support.  After a long time, here is the result.  He told me that this EX3700 is only good for speed up to 20 MBPS and anything higher, I should use the model 8000{?}.  Why was this information not on the product description!!  Wasted our time and their time.  In fact the product description on Amazon is very confusing and miss leading:  Read below:NETGEAR Wifi Range Extender EX3700 - Coverage Up to 1000 Sq.ft. and 15 devices with AC750 Dual Wireless Signal Booster & Repeaterby NETGEAREXTENDED WIRELESS COVERAGE: Adds WiFi range coverage up to 1000 square feet, and connects up to 15 devices such as laptops, smartphones, speakers, IP cameras, tablets, IoT devices, and moreAC750 WIFI SPEED: Provides up to 750Mbps performance using dual band and patented FastLane technologyUNIVERSAL COMPATIBILITY: Works with any wireless router, gateway, or cable modem with WiFi. The product may not be compatible with routers or gateways with firmware that has been altered, is based on open source programs, or is non standard or outdatedWIRED ETHERNET PORT: Simply plug in game consoles, streaming players, or other nearby wired devices using the one 10/100M port for maximum speedSAFE & SECURE: Supports WEP and WPA/WPA2 wireless security protocolsSIMPLE TO SETUP: Press the WPS button to connect to your router. Use the NETGEAR WiFi Analyzer app for optimal location.No idea where this model ""AC750 WIFI SPEED: Provides up to 750Mbps performance using dual band and patented FastLane technology "" come from.  This is confusing.And the Netgear agent told me that I should have contacted Technical Support to find out more about this unit from Netgear before I buy it from Amazon.  Is this BS or not and how many of us with do that.  Apparently Netgear sold many of these  slow units to home with slow internet speed.  But there are many customers complained about this reduction in speed with this unit.  Yet Amazon or Netgear do not respond and make correction or correct the omission that this unit is for 20 MBPS only.  After almost one hour, finally I gave up and decided to return this.  Amazon agent was soooo kind to give me fund refund!  Wow!  I think I may get $5 coupon for our hours of work.  Netgear management, fix the problem and it is also Amazon's responsibility too!.

  Product was easy to install. Installation was done by my 15+ years old son who is fascinated with technology. We first placed the extender in his room but sign3sl was poor. So we lluggednit in a wall socket in tge dining room just outside his bedroom door and in close proximity to the router and it works like a charm. He had a challenge getting good internet connectivity in his bedroom as such he would have to step out into the adjoining dining to pick up signal. Since the installation, internet connectivity has been absolutely great in his room and in the nughts when signals are normally lower he still has good signal above average in his room. No more lagging of FB videos, zoom classes etc.

  It took me a little while to get this set up with our router. Now that everything is working, the Wi-Fi signal is very strong throughout our entire house. We don’t seem to have any trouble with connection. We have 2 laptops, 2 phones, Amazon fire, a PS3, and a PS4 connected to this device.Getting this device connected to a router was the only difficult part. I’m kind of tech savvy so this wasn’t too tough for me. However, I could see how this would be tough for someone who doesn’t know much about setting up tech equipment. The instructions were good, so if you follow those you shouldn’t have any trouble. We are really happy with the boost of our Wi-Fi signal. This was a good purchase.

  These work. They don’t work great but they work. I haven’t found any of these extenders or boosters to work all that great so these will do as well as any. I think it has to do with FCC regulations that make everything work just mediocre. I have a large property and I had to daisy chain some of these for them to do what I needed. I wish they had made the signal stronger and the data stream is limited for some reason . I have no idea why it is slow compared to the original WiFi signal

  I'm pretty good with electronics and computers, I'm a programmer. I've owned and used this for 5 months now. I have used this extender off of a Netgear R6250 router, and the initial setup using WPS works fine. It finds my network, sets up new SSIDs for the 2.4 and 5 Ghz bands, and works fine. For a couple months.Then suddenly it stops working. The lights say it's on, you can see the SSID listed, but if you connect to it (I've tested with phones, tablets, and laptops) it will say, 'No Internet Connection', even though the Router LED is green.I've had to factory reset it to get it back up and running.The firmware is up to date. My router settings don't change, I don't move it, it just stops working. I don't have time to fuss with it over and over again. I have some smart home devices that don't automatically switch to the other SSIDs in the house, since this still reads as available, so they stop working. It's too much hassle to keep it running, so I'm pulling it out of use at my house.

  ABSOLUTELY WORTH THE $$ Don’t let the reasonable price fool you into thinking this doesn’t live up, this was worth every penny and more!Setup was SUPER easy if you follow the instructions. If you’re not a tech savvy person be sure to follow directions and be patient for the lights to turn green, meaning only a minute or so and it will work. If after a minute push the on/off button as it states and start again. I am fortunate to have a spot on outlet upstairs where I plugged this in after setup that is directly above my downstairs router. My entire upstairs is now covered and the connectivity issues we had are GONE. Important for me when having to go through various networks while working from home. To give you a better idea of size, my home is 1650 sqft. Internet providers router is in the central point of my main level and I plugged this product upstairs right above the router. I could not connect my work laptop at all prior, but with this item I can now choose to work remotely anywhere in my home. We are now able to stream on a tv, have another tv on, 3 laptops running, WiFi printer, and an Xbox and PlayStation all going at the same time without delays or disconnections. Added bonus was finding out that the product even boosted the garage with a stronger connection than we were getting from the main router which is closer to the garage. I highly recommend this item!

  Bought 2 extenders.  Netgear has a very good reputation.  Our house is long, brick ranch so signal from router drops at both ends of the house.  Of course the den and the master bedroom are at opposite ends of the house.  Used an extender in each of those rooms.  Fairly easy to setup, but could be confusing to some.  Good good signal strength for Amazon Fire Stick, laptops, tablets, and cell phones.  To get best signal strength you may need to plug them into an extension cord so that you can alter placement.  Only con is they tend to get a little warm.  We would purchase more if needed.

  I tried a similar product (wifi extender) few years back and it was lowering the internet speed tremendously.Then After few years passed I figured that the technology may have gotten better, but I was wrong. Item arrived and being an electronic Engineer, I measured the speed / transmission loss at 5G (fast internet) speed. Internet speed was cut down in half from 200mb/s to 100 mb/s and that was measured when I was latterly next to the wifi router.Then when I moved the extender to 40ft away from my router, I checked the signal and I had 75% loss.So technology is not there yet. I will try again in few year, but for now i returned it and in my opinion it is a waste of money.

  I knew when buying this that I have never had good experience with netgear products, but it seemed simple enough for what I needed.Please be aware when buying this that you will not get 750mbps connections. The extender is capable of receiving a 780 mbps connection from your router, but will not broadcast at that speed. I have Gb internet in my home but my gateway from xfinity cannot reach the other end of the house from where the gateway is located. I wanted to use this to extend our signal to our Main bedroom to use with a PS4 for netflix and the like. I put the extender in a central location (I actually tried every outlet in the central area of our home) and found the outlet with the best connection to our gateway, as well as a good connection to the device. The output from the extender was 40mbps. While this is plenty to stream video, PS4's tend to either throttle download speeds or their hardware is not capable enough to receive high speeds over wifi. I end up getting 6mbps to the playstation. I ran a speedtest from my phone in the exact location of the playstation and over wifi to my android I was getting about 35 mbps.I attempted to use the Fastlane technology built in to the extender with no noticeable difference at all. The idea behind this is strong, where the extender receives on one band but broadcasts on another. I just dont think the extender has the processing power to faithfully reproduce a good high speed signal, since it's processor is pulling double duty on receiving and transmitting.The product actually provided a wifi signal that devices could connect to, but the speeds were atrocious. If you have high speed internet and only need to extend your range for basic web surfing and email then you should be fine. I would not rely on this device for any sort of streaming or gaming though.Lastly, don't expect anything from netgear tech support after 90 days. You will have to pay for it.

",4.0 ,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States August 5, 2019","









  
  
    
  I thought I would use this extender to distribute both 2.4 and 5 GHz bands from my wifi router, an ASUS RT-ACRH13, using ""basic"" mode. (The router is at one edge of the apartment and has trouble getting to the other end.) The 2.4 GHz worked easily, but I could not get 5 GHz to work.  There may be some extra router configuration needed.So I decided to use the ""FastLane"" option, set up so that the extender communicates to the router at 5 GHz  and communicates to my devices at 2.4 GHz.  This works reliably and (probably) much faster than repeating 2.4 GHz ""in band"". (The 5 GHz bit rate is more than double the 2.4 rate.) Result: very strong coverage at 2.4 GHz over my 1600 sq ft area.

  I live in a household where the home's router is installed in one end of the home, and my room is situated in the area farthest and opposite of it. I can get Internet access to things at an okay speed, but I noticed that trying to do anything involving online voice-chatting, streaming, or multiplayer gaming related would be a bit slower than it should, especially on a computer that is less than a year old and is specifically meant to handle that stuff. In the beginning, it was fine since only a few online devices were connected to the Wi-Fi at a time, so any hiccups were few and temporary. This was before the family decided to invest in a few streaming devices (Roku, Smart-TV, ect.) Once those were set up and in use, everything I did either buffered or slowed to a crawl. This was especially aggravating since that made voice-chatting impossible due to how robotic I would sound to friends I routinely chat with, and it was becoming a literal headache trying to figure out what was causing it.I received this earlier today, and within 10 minutes of setting it I could *feel* the immediate improvement the moment I plugged it in an area near where my room is. Every stress-induced ache I was dealing with in the past vanished the moment I saw how fast I was opening a web-page or opening up a Youtube video. I even managed to have a lengthy voice-chat with some Discord friends for a good couple of hours since the setup was done, something I could not have had had I not bought this.I will update this review in the next couple of months if there are any changes in how this extender functions, but just from a first time experience, absolutely worth it.

  Pros: This applies specifically to setting up this extender to accept Amazon Firestick content. The extender delivers a strong signal when placed between the TV and modem. My indication went from “Poor” to “Very Strong.” It’s small, unobtrusive and easy to see the front panel. This is an excellent choice. The images and streaming are better than 1080 cable broadcast. I give it 5 stars for the signal delivery and image quality, 3 stars for the difficulty in setting it up. Better instructions would have helped.Cons: I do not have a smart TV in the distant family room. I bought this because I have a Netgear modem and thought it would be “Plug and Play.” The instruction booklet says to pair the extender with your modem with the WPS buttons. I tried this several times and it would not pair Netgear to Netgear. Disappointing. The second method is to set up a new network. If your WSP option fails, you will need to discover the extender’s signal (…._2GEXT) and install a new network on your computer with passwords, etc. Turning on your TV, you must go through an extensive menu setting up the pairing. After two hours, the TV was now streaming Firestick content.Last headache: After getting the TV to work with the extender, I used the computer to check e-mail and my WiFi gave me messages that ISP protocol was absent. The extender setup crashed my Wifi and none of my other devices could access my modem. After an hour of attempts to reconnect everything using “Disconnect” and reinstalling my original network, I was ready to return the extender, Firestick and forget streaming. As a last effort, I unplugged my modem, Ethernet cable and phone line, waited five minutes and re-connected everything. Voila! Everything works: all my WiFi devices, televisions, Firestick, extender. Such a hassle, but the extra content is worth the effort. If possible, find a neighborhood nerd to help you.

  Overall, it works pretty well. The range extender is about 10 feet away from my computer, through 2 walls separating a set of wood stairs, but I don't get full signal strength.Because I bought one through the Amazon warehouse, that had likely been tried and returned, it wasn't a clean installation experience (even though I attempted to reset it before I started).  It took over an hour, with Netgear tech support, to figure out that it needed a special hard reset. After that, the install went smoothly. It was absolutely NOT worth the money saved to go through the extra hassle during install.

  Pretty easy to install. I bought this device to extend my WiFi to the front and side of my house where I have to wireless cameras and a doorbell camera. I have an old house with a lot of bricks, and stones. My cameras were always failing and going offline because the signal from my router was not strong enough to get through the structures even with my router in its best convenient location. Since I've added this extender to the front of my house all my cameras are always reliably online and I can see whatever's going on or who's at the door if I'm not prepared to answer in person.I set mine up as instructed but used the URL instead. I have dual band and I did name the two ""extended"" SSID's the same as my home wireless ones and gave it the same passwords. The two extended SSID's were given ""Ext"" added to the names as extended. Nothing else connects to this device as its sole purpose was for the cameras only and to test the device before I bought more. I will continue to test it out and update my review if anything changes over the next month. If all goes well I'll be buying two more. One to extend my range to my yard or garage and one for the rear bedrooms in the house that get low WiFi signals.Read the IT Network Engineer Guys review and follow his instructions if you need help.

  The product worked as designed, but I was unhappy with the throughput and the software based setup was crap (this coming from a professional Software Engineer). A company like NetGear should be able to put together a better user experience than the setup software affords, truly junk.The device is nicely built but I was hopeful that, while all repeaters will slow your throughput, it wouldn't have slowed it to the degree it did. The furthest device from my router had signal prior to introducing this device but it was poor. I purchased the device to improve the signal strength (which it did marginally) but after introducing it, the throughput was so much slower and we ended up just tossing the repeater and going back to the faster, but weaker signal.Ultimately we ended up purchasing a Netgear A6210 (wireless NIC) and installing that instead of the extendeer, and in place of the integrated wireless nic, and that made a HUGE improvement to both signal strength and throughput. I'd suggest doing something similar instead of buying this product. Good luck.

  First--I had to figure out on my own how to set it up. Installation instructions on Netgear left a lot to be desired. Luckily, I do have a lot of experience with these type of things. After several, I mean several, hours, I got it set up and the wifi signal extended to my husband's workshop. That worked for 2 weeks. Count them, 2 weeks! Then, our modem went out and we had it replaced. I figured, no problem. I'd set it up again. Set up up the same way I had before, the way in which I figured out on my own how to do it because the instructions on Netgear leave ALOT out. I got the 2.4gz network set up, but the 5gz network wouldn't work. So, I go back in and set up the 5hz network, but then the setup for the 2.4gz didn't work. Back and forth for 3 HOURS! Finally, somehow, don't ask me how, I got them BOTH working. With a huge sigh of relief, I placed the extender in the same place where it had been before BUT while it was connected, there was no INTERNET! Checked the troubleshooter. That said it had an invalid IP configuration. I messed with all of the settings, doing EVERYTHING it said on the Internet about this issue, nothing worked. Called Netgear. We put it back to factory settings, and tht thing refused to be set up. Wouldn't work at all. Luckily, it was still under warranty. Sent it back. Got another, because it did work for 2 weeks. Set it up. Had green bars all the way--for 30 seconds! Then, connected, but no internet for the 2.4gz. Called support. She had me set it back to factory settings, and then told me to connect to the network--the extender network. I told her, ""We just set it back to factory settings. There is no extender network. We now have to set it up AGAIN!"" She had no idea what I was talking about. Said she would talk to her boss and call me back in 10 minutes. A half hour later, no phone call. So, since I am SOOOO experienced in setting this up now, I go through the steps to set it up again. 2.4gz STILL has no valid IP configuration. I threw it back in the box and packed it up to send back for refund. I'm going to another manufacturer.

  I thought we were perfect candidates for this thing. We have a few rooms that you have to be in a certain spot in order to get enough wifi to use the internet. Even though the extended network signal was much stronger the quality of internet was awful. Within minutes I had someone reporting that their youtube videos kept buffering. They got back on to the original wifi network, got in their spot and it was back to normal. I tested around the house and signal drops off dramatically and fast and even right next to the extender I could not get through a 1 minute youtube video without buffering multiple times. I tried moving the extender closer to the source and that did not work. It actually made one of the problem rooms have worse reception than the original wifi. It was easy to set up though...

  I have had this extender since April of 2020.  I am a computer savvy person so no issues there.  Not the easiest to install but okay.  Signal strength is adequate (not great) for most home use.  Reasonably faultless operation.  However, changed my network router.  When I went to reconnect the extender, it wasn't as straight forward as just pushing the WPS setup.  I had to go into the web browser setup after several attempts to get it connected with the WPS.  The installation required me to do a firmware update to proceed.  Once I did, the train came off the rails.  I could now use WPS as intended, but I could not get the device to connect anything to the internet, even though I could see the extenders networks.  Tried the Netgear community and found this is a common issue with no posted resolution (after firmware update).  Tried calling Netgear, but they gave me the runaround with no (absolutely no) help except to offer me a service support contract for $89.  Instead, I spent $40 and gat a different company's extender that has much better ratings and performance. DON'T BUY PRODUCTS THAT THE MANUFACTURER CAUSES AND ISSUE AND REFUSES HELP UNLESS YOU PAY UP!  Don't know what's happened to Netgear.  10 years ago or a little more, they were one of the best.  But now reading reviews and comments on the community bulletin board, they are not as they used to be.  After checking things out, there are better suppliers with better products.

  Worked as described for my situation.  I bought a security camera and installed it in the front of the house.  My wifi did not reach that far so I purchased this wifi extender.  As described, you do have to play with where to put extender so you get good wifi signal from your router and to the device you want.  It has been a week now and I haven't had any disconnection of my security camera.  For my houses configuration, wifi extender could only go about 30 ft away from my router.  That being said, if you have a really big house, you may need two wifi extenders (one on each side of router).  Good price.  In my case, mission accomplished.

  If you do not configure this device via WPS and instead want to use the included web server to configure it to your network, you will find that it FORCES you to create an account at Netgear before bringing you to the real configuration page. I find this behavior on the part of Netgear pretty abhorrent.I found a workaround on Youtube that shows how to get around this. You basically go to the config page, and rather than enter the information required for the Netgear account, just edit the url to go to mywifiext.net/start.htm. Note that the system also stores a cookie on your computer with a session id, which may keep this from working, so best to do this from an incognito window.That aside, I've had the unit up a couple of days now and it seems to work fine.

  Works great. Super easy setup with WPS (WiFi Protected Setup). We recently moved my wife's office to the front of the house, and the router went with it. This meant that many devices in the rear of the house could not get a strong enough WiFi signal to operate, including our Alexa switches, Echo Dot, etc. So I bought this range extender in the hope that it would provide a stronger signal to the rest of the house - and it does. I was most impressed by ease of setup. I used the WPS feature on my Netgear router and in just a couple of button presses the extender was up and running. You do need to reselect the WiFi network on your devices - the new network will be the same name as your old router SSD + ""_EXT"", so its easy to find and select. The unit is also quite a bit smaller than the one shown in their video which is nice since it takes up an electrical outlet space. Bottom line: this was a great purchase. Highly recommend.

  Basic fact:Using a ""range extender"" or ""repeater"" will, at the very best give you 1/2 the speed of the signal source (Learned the Hard Way!).This particular range extender is weak. All this type of stuff being made in China makes it hard to judge if the cheap price is the result of slave labor or very marginal product hardware (try to read between the lines on that sort of vague statement).Spend at bit more but expect slower speed almost no matter what you spend. The higher price should correspond to greater transmit power.Amazon is a great place to find out what does and does not work.

I spent 5 hours working to resolve the 2.4 and 5.0 band issues. I could get 2.4 to work then 5.0 wouldn't work and visa-versa. Then once the 2.4 and 5.0 bands were connected, I was unable to access the internet at all. So, only one band works at a time.

  I got this because my WiFi signal is very weak in my area of the property (included in my RV lot rent, so I can’t complain because it’s weak). It has improved my signal so that I can get online anywhere in my trailer (used to be only in the back of the trailer), but not much farther. It’s worth what I paid, but if you think you’ll be streaming Netflix on the edge of the original signal, you will be disappointed. It might be stronger if I could have plugged it into the main router, but 1) I’m not going to ask my landlord if I can trot into his house to improve my WiFi, and 2) it improved it enough for my purposes, so why bother?  I’ve heard that it resets constantly or quits working after a few weeks, but it’s been working fine for going on 3 months now.

  Having recently purchased an R6120 from Netgrear, which proved to be a great disappointment, I was hesitant to try this product. The R6120 barely covers 20 feet in range (verified with support that this is ""normal""). This device, however, covers a good 50 feet quite easily on both the 2.4 and 5Ghz bands through typical house drywall walls, etc. As expected, 5Ghz drops off first. My Canon printer, which would routinely drop a connection with the R6120, has been steadily up since connecting to this device. Connecting to it and setting it up were a walk in the park (basically connect to its web address and follow the prompts). Absolutely a necessary purchase for several conventional WiFi routers. There have been a few folks who reported short lifetimes. If that occurs I'll edit this post.

  15 years ago, I wired my house with CAT-5.  Except for my home office, I haven't had much use for it since everything is wireless...at least until I started using more wireless devices in my living room and I realized how bad our reception was at that end of the house.  (My router is from Netgear and is 15 years old (300/300) and I am renting my modem/router from Xfinity.)Downloading had been slow and intermittent.  Coverage was so bad that I had even gone over my GB's with my wireless service a few months because there were times I didn't realize I wasn't getting enough coverage from my router.I downloaded an app by IP Tools to tell me what kind of wireless bandwidth we were getting around our house.  In our living room, the app showed that we were getting about 30 Mbps (or less) out the 300 Mbps my router offers.Forward to a few weeks ago.  I went online and found this extender.  I bought it not realizing that it had an ethernet input - I thought the port was for output only.  (Doing an online search of the subject, everyone who asked about extenders with ethernet inputs were told there were none available - instead, they were told to buy a second router.)When I opened the box and looked at the instructions, I read that the ethernet port was for both input and output.  I plugged in the extender, followed the instructions and tested the output.  I was amazed.The app on my phone read that I am consistently getting 866 Mbps in my living room.  WOW!!!I have no idea why I am getting so much bandwidth - but I'll take it.The product: Super easy to install and it is lighting fast.The product's owner:  Super excited.

  Got this as a replacement for another older model Netgear extender that died.  Plugged it in and it initially worked great but then the ""router"" lite kept turning red.  After reading several reviewers who had the same problem I looked into changing the position of the host router.  Since I had no problems with the old extender I didn't even think to start looking there.  Well, after moving the router around a little bit, bingo, that solved the problem.  Strong ""green"" signal on the extender and it is much faster than the older one.  If you have this problem try moving the host router first.  Almost sent it back but glad I tried that.  Very satisfied now.

    Easy To Set Up, Works Well

  This is a great cheap solution for wifi dead spots. The WPS set up works and is very simple. After that you just plug it in where you want it and connect to it like you would any router. If you follow the instructions, it takes less than 10 minutes to set up. With a bandwidth of 750 mbps it's sufficient for 1-2 rooms max, depending on your wifi. A couple of quirky things about it, that may be unique to my setup: about half the time it takes 2 attempts to connect to the wifi; the first attempt usually results in a ""connected no internet"" message, but once you connect it's perfect. Secondly, the led indicators seem inaccurate. I'll have great signal strength and fast speeds, but the led will be red as if there were no connection.All in all it's a great quick and affordable solution for expanding your wifi area. Definitely recommend.

  I just started working from home due to the world burning down around us, and I was sent a VOIP phone to use that needed to be directly connected to our router. The problem is that the router is tucked in one corner of our home, whereas my office is in the bedroom. One option was to get a very long ethernet cable that would be hideous and annoying to manage, so I searched for other options. That's when I discovered wifi extenders. I am still not sure how they work, but I am positive that this one works great. I have not had any connectivity issues at all. Even when my computer connects to it by mistake (I really got it just for the phone) everything runs smoothly. I would definitely recommend this as the other options are bulky, unmanageable, or extremely over priced.

I had to unplug it and plug it back in every morning before I started working. Now, it's cutting out while working. Since all of my work is internet based, this is a huge inconvenience.

  I recently bought a Ring floodlight cam for our garage but the wifi was just out of range and it kept losing connection. After reading some reviews online and on Youtube, I ended up getting the EX3700 mainly because of the pricepoint.After setting it up and finding the right spot in the house to place it, the ring still kept losing connection. At least that is what I thought. The ring was still connected to the extender but the extender itself kept losing internet connection every other week or so. I thought it was a bust until I found a neat little configuration. FastLane Technology.  Because the extender is dual band, you can configure it to connect via 5G to your router and then 2G to your devices or vice versa. This optimized the connections on both ends and I havent had an issue since.Im a tech saavy person but my degree is in software engineering, not networking. I still dont know the root cause of the connection loss while not using the Fastlane Tech(still curious, so if you are a network engineer id be open to your thoughts)  but if anyone who purchases this device is having connectivity issues,  I would highly suggest enabling this feature.

  I did thorough investigation on a number of WiFi extends since I currently rent a concrete basement in a large house where the modem is on the top floor of the opposite end of the house. I settled on this product and could not be happier. While some people say that this product slowed their internet down too much, I did not notice that issue at all and appreciate how it really did strengthen my connection. I learned that the best place to position the product is HALFWAY between where you are located and where the modem is to maximize communication between the two devices. Overall, I would recommend this product to a friend who has poor WiFi connection and is hoping to amp it up!

  Was searching for a way to boost my WiFi through my 2-story loft condo. Thick brick walls and high ceilings made the signal lessen on my lower level. I figured I try this given it wasn’t a major investment compared to a total mesh type WiFi network. Followed the instructions and it worked flawlessly. Initially it had a new network name (in addition to my existing network). Quick search online showed me I could rename the WiFi extender “network” with the same name as my current network. Now my phone or laptop doesn’t know any different and just switches over to the extender when I’m downstairs (and WiFi is the same name) and I have full bars always!! Flawless solution.

  Works well for extending WiFi to the upstairs rooms in our house.  As others have described though, the setup was fairly complicated even with the instructions. Connecting to the setup screen didn't work with the first PC that I used and I had to try a few different devices before I could log into the device to configure it.  Apparently certain devices/operating systems aren't compatible.  After a few hours of messing around with it, I did end up getting it to work and it seems to be doing what it's advertised to do.  My only complaint is that I wanted to use it as an access point and not an extender and I still haven't been able to get that working properly.  It seems to cause a conflict on the network when set up as an access point and your devices keep dropping connection.

  I've only had this up and running for two days but I'm impressed how it solved my wifi problem. Reason for just 4 stars is because it's early and because I rarely give 5 stars for anything. As for my use, I have an ATT uverse modem made by Arris. The ATT wifi is able to cover most of 2600 sq ft. fairly well from a back corner of my house where my office is located. Problem was that I have a Nest outdoor camera watching the driveway at the front of the house. The modem wifi had to pass through three walls including a brick wall to get to the camera. As a result the camera was often going offline.As for setting up the AC750 the process for me was simple and easy, but BE PATIENT. It takes a few minutes, maybe 5 to 10 minutes to get it powered on, booted up and shaking hands with the modem via wps buttons. All of that is very easy but I did wonder at first if it was working. After powering on, going from a yellow light to a green power light took a few minutes to complete. Similarly, after that and moving to the wps handshake it took a few more mintues for the process to complete and then a little more time for the AC750 router light to turn green and showing all was good. If you need 5ghz just do the wps handshake a second time.The AC750 default is as a new wifi access point but can also be used as extender of the original wifi. I went with the default new access point since it seemed to be suggested. After the handshake I placed the NETGEAR halfway between att at the back of the house and the camera overlooking driveway in the front.At this point is where things became a bit more difficult. Getting the Nest camera to see the new wifi took a lot more time and a few trips up and down a ladder. There does not appear to be an easy way to just switch access points on a Nest cam so i ended up removing the camera via nest app and then adding it back as a new device. That gave me access to all the wifi networks close to my house and I was able to sign in to the new access point. The camera is up and running and so far has been stable with no drop outs. I also did a check of the original modem's internet speeds , both ethernet and wifi, and there is no decline in speeds from before installing the AC750. I also checked the speed of the new AC750 access point. The new wifi is not quite as fast as the original access point but still well within spec needs of the Nest cam.

Connected the extender to the router using all the step provided, using 2g and 5g networks. Tried using 2g connection on Xbox from extender and lags more than connecting to router. Tried using 5g connection and extender drops connection every 2-3 mins. Updated firmware and did a factory reset. Set everything back up and tried again. Same thing, 2g laggy and 5g drops everytime. Also used ethernet port from extender to Xbox. Once again, drops every 2-3 mins.

It’s that simple and prides both a 2 G and 5G connection. I would (and do) recommend this product to both friends and family, as well as a stranger. Great product!

  A few months ago, I had purchased a 2.4 GHz WiFi extender to improve the quality of our Wireless networks. My family couldn't stop thanking me for improving the range, but I felt like Streaming and VoIP quality was still lacking (we use Internet Calling apps). So, I looked up a 5 GHz Range Extender and found this one (which also has 2.4 GHz). So far, as long as you're within a decent range of your original router, this should do the trick! We have a SmartTV that we use to stream with and it has DRASTICALLY IMPROVED since I installed this little box. My family has never complained of lack of internet connection ever since. Now, I've recommended this little device to others and, so far, everyone seems to like the larger Wireless range. And, for such a small box, it does a GREAT JOB!

  Bought after seeing the thousands of good reviews. I get 100Mbps download/5Mbps upload from my internet provider, as proven using speed tests right next to the modem/router. I wanted an extender that I could conveniently place to catch the signal about 30ft from the modem/router and extend it  30-40 ft to the rooms upstairs. I verified that I was getting an 80-90Mbps signal from the modem/router right next to where I placed the extender. However, I found that upstairs, even after using the extender, I could never get a signal more than 15-20Mbps, with or without the extender. Eventually, I simply put the extender right next to the router, and finally found that even then(!!) I couldnt get more than 15-20Mbps, but without the extender I was getting an easy 80-90Mbps. This thing is just not built for high bandwidth, IMHO. If your requirement is similar, hopefully this review is useful to you. I'm probably going to end up with mesh wifi even though its more expensive.

  If I could give negative stars, I would.  My Netgear AC750 WiFi Range Extender arrived exactly on time and looked terrific.  The problems began as soon as I opened the box and tried to read the instructions.  As others have noted, the instructions were written by someone who clearly doesn't speak English as a first language.  The ""simple"" first set-up option didn't work because I didn't have a corresponding security button on my router to push.  My router is supplied by my cable provider, Time Warner Cable.  Not to worry - there was a second option.  That option begins by giving an IP address to type in my browser.  Using three different browsers (Safari, Chrome, and Firefox) I got messages saying the address I was searching for doesn't exist.  Called TWC and spent more than an hour on the phone with them - no luck.  Called Netgear.  They said the IP address in the instruction booklet wasn't the right address and, in fact, I shouldn't type anything at all.  I was instructed to open my wifi options to connect to the Internet, and look for the network Neatgear_ext.  I was actually able to get the device to work that way.  It worked (poorly) once.  When I closed my browser, it quit.  I called Netgear back and they started to walk me though it again.  They spent 20 minutes adding new firmware to my unit (one of those horrible hidden reset buttons that require pushing a paper clip for 30 seconds while I was standing upside down).  Still didn't work.  Netgear finally concluded my unit was defective and I should return it to Amazon for a replacement.  That's where I am today, waiting for a replacement.

I placed the netgear box in a spot in the main house that avoided the cinderblock obstruction, and it boosted the WiFi signal to the remoter part of the house by one or two bars.  So, complete success. This was one of the cheaper extenders I researched, reasoning correctly that signal propagation did not require a sophisticated device. Set up was easy, even without WPS. For what it’s worth, the light displays on the device don’t seem to correspond to anything relevant to the effectiveness of the signal propagation.

  This item made all the difference in extending our WiFi into a corner of the house that our universal gateway/router just couldn't reach.  It made all the difference in being to convert two TVs in that part of the house over to using Roku via our WiFi so we could eliminate renting two of the small auxiliary cable boxes from Comcast for which they just raised the monthly rental charge up to $7 per month apiece.  So, that's a savings of $14 per month off our cable bill for a one time cost of $30 for this extender and $60 for the two Roku units.  So, it all pays for itself in less than 7 months and then we're ahead $14 every month after that.  The best part is that with the Rokus we get all the same channels as our main cable/DVR box instead of just basic service we were getting on the little Comcast boxes.

  First of all - Setup. A lot of people have complained about a difficult set up and others have said it was amazingly easy. I found it to be neither. The WPS connection business didn't work for me. I read someone else's review later and it said that the included instructions were no good. So, maybe that was the problem. I did a web connection set up and it set up on my guest network fine, but took a lot more effort to set up my primary network. It kept saying my password was wrong.Once I got ALL of that going, I left the extender in the same room as the router and moved 2 rooms over and it lost the signal for my 5GHz networks. With some finagling, I was able to get it to reconnect to them, but the signal was weak. I primarily bought this because the description said it would boost internet speeds. I performed speed tests on 3 different websites and all of them showed that the extender actually slowed my download and upload speeds. The speeds on the extended networks were slower AND I ran another speed test on my regular networks after disconnecting the extender and even THEY were faster once it was disconnected.I thought about keeping it if it would simply extend the network. I had my cousin, who is in the most remote location on the property try to get online and she could even pick up the broadcast of the extended networks. She could, however, see my non-extended networks being broadcast. In short, this really doesn't work.

I updated the firmware, which didn't do anything. Tech support was a miss, unknowledgeable reps kept walking me through resetting it over and over again, which did not fix it. Tech said it's just a low signal unit. Told me to buy a more expensive one next time. But it was pretty easy to install.

  So I dont know how new or old this model is, but I bought two and neither worked as advertised. Im in the process of getting a refund right now. The seller sent me the product in a timely manner and I believe the devices to be in working order just from unboxing and appearance etc.... However, when I set them up to extend my ac network, I could never get the SSID to broadcast properly, and devices that attempted to connect when the SSID was visible, said no-internet. They had limited connections that never fully sync'd in. My router and the extenders were maybe 15 feet away from each other.These extenders were the same name brand as the wireless router I use and I thought this would help, it didnt.There are forums online that say the netgears have trouble with the symptom I describe. Even though the forum starts out by saying its occurring on an N300, the issue seems to occur with all models.Im going to see if another brand will help.

  This is a review post-installation; long-term usage TBC.OVERALL / CONTEXTThis is awesome. My apartment is ~1000 sq. ft and the router is at the front of the house. I previously couldn't get even a single bar of wifi in the back of the house.I placed the netgear extender in a room between the front and back of the apartment and I now have full bars of wifi in the back room.SETUPSetup was reasonably easy and intuitive; I followed the instructions step-by-step and was up and running in about 15-20 minutes. The only snag is that when I removed the unit from the front room (you need to do the setup near the router initially) and then plugged it into the desired location, it wasn't working at first -- because my computer had auto-defaulted back to the original network once the device was unplugged (it should be on the new network). So check to which wifi network you're connected if for some reason the device doesn't seem to be responding.

  This thing looks and works great boosting the signal to one of my security cameras.... but the journey towards successful operation was one I hope to never repeat.Here's a message for Netgear: When you develop a new product and you are ready to launch it to the public... give the product and instructions to one of your grandmothers to see if she can easily get it going.... if not, go back and work on it until she can, and I believe that no other electronics company will be able to compete with you.I could go on about my trail of frustration while getting this thing online, but the final straw was after all was working and it demanded that I register this product,  It would not accept my credentials since it said I was already registered with Netgear, and that I was using the wrong password... so it sent me a new password via email... still would not work, so I tried to register as a new customer... nope.... so I finally had to register it under my wife's name, so now I have to remember a whole new set of info.... now comes the job of reconnecting to my extender under the new credentials… nope, wont buy that either.... make sure that no children area around when you are going thru this... were not done yet,,, because when I tried to log into my Nighthawk app the next morning, it locked me out because it said it wasn't me... another hour of frustration, and that finally works again...You don't get a phone number to call for help until all the registration crap is done, so you are left out in the cold.... besides, other reviews on here suggest that Netgear support is all but useless.I have about a dozen Netgear items, so I'm sort of stuck with them... I wish my daughter would have married a nerd so I could find out what company to use besides Netgear for any future electronics purchases.

I found another person online who was having the same issue.  Ran speed tests and they were good; as expected.  Moved the extender all over the house and actually, the closer we got to the router, the signal didn't get better as expected.

  There is nothing this can do that moving your router/modem can't do. I spent time moving things all over the house. In the end, I ended up not using this, because the signal from my router was better than the extender,and I had them in the same place as a test. I have a Nighthawk 8000 that I turned into an AP with my Xfinity modem in a different room. I mean, this isn't bad if you're out of options, but don't expect it to do wonders.I did experience some speed reduction and disconnecting when connecting to this as well.

  I am a pretty tech-saavy guy.  I bought this thinking this would be plug and play. There could not be anything further from the truth.We have Spectrum in NYC (formerly Time Warner). We bought this to have coverage over the office space. Our settings for WPS would not work for whatever reason, so we had to proceed manually. Little did I know that I would start a journey into a deep rabbit hole. Between repeating the instructions multiple times, tweaks, constant signal resets of the extender disrupting the flow, and customer service holds and repetitive instructions, i literally spent 2 full days trying to make it work.  Customer service was atrocious. I spoke to 4 different people, of which only 1 could speak decent english.1 interaction:Him : Find internet settings menuMe : There is no such thingMe : (i read the list to him)Him: We need to find the menuMe : Ok, but this makes no sense, don't you know the menus I can see ?Him : No, its the prior model, we don't have troubleshooting manuals for itMe :  What ? If this was a car from last year, do you think it would be acceptable to sell a car without tires, just because the car was older ?  How can you not have the manual for this ?Him : ....Anyway. The only thing I can say in their defense is that I have Spectrum, and that company is atrocious, as are their services. The actual knowledgeable support lady did say that customers with Spectrum run into issues. If that is the case and it is known. SAY IT IN THE BUYING PAGE, NETGEAR !!  DO NOT SELL GARBAGE KNOWN NOT TO WORK !If you are wondering why I did this for 2 full days, it is because we really needed it.  We started new jobs working remotely and there were a lot of zooms to be attended.In Summary - avoid like the plague if you are a Spectrum customer.

  I bought this unit 2 years ago. I am very impressed by the signal strength of this extender.My home office is upstairs where my router is placed. It's an old Netgear WNR1000v3 router which I bought 12 years ago. The signal strength outside my home office was very low, especially in the main floor I barely had any WIFI signal. I have a 70 MBPS internet connection and standing directly in front of the router, I get only 44MBPS speed. If I step out, it drops further.I ended up buying this extender and connected to my Home LAN network ethernet port downstairs in the master bedroom and vola. I now have 64 MBPS WIFi strength in most areas of the main floor except one guest bedroom which is far away from the extender on the other corner of the house.SO I bought another extender and tried to hook up to the same LAN in the guest bedroom but for some reason it didn't workout. Seems like you can't have multiple extenders on the same network online at the same time maybe. I'm not a networking expert, so I couldn't figure out what was going on and hence I ended up returning the 2nd unit.But I am happy with my initial purchase and still have that unit  in my master bedroom downstairs. Currently I am working from home and typing this up, sitting on my guest bedroom upstairs which is directly above the master bathroom next to the master bed where the extender is and  I get  67 MBPS Internet speed compared to my old router, still in the home office, directly across the guest bedroom(in plain sight) and  and it gives me barely 16 MBPS speed. I need a new router for sure. But this extender is definitely MY HERO and worth the price.My doggy chewed it up when I first bought it, so it has some scratches and dents on the exterior but still performs like a champ. :)

  This product is very difficult to connect to the router!!I followed the instructions for WPS using the option to join a secure WiFi network without typing the network name and password.  That's all great (a 2GEXT and 5GEXT showed up as extensions) until you try to connect a device.The only way I was able to connect a device to the extended 2GEXT or 5GEXT was to connect wirelessly with a fairly new ChromeBook by pushing the WPS button on the extender.  THEN, once I was on the WiFi extender network, and only then was I able to get to the mywifiext.net at NetGear's site to set up the extender and get a password for other devices.  Most devices I have are not new enough to connect to the WiFi extender by pushing the WPS button on the extender.  Once I got the seriously long 75 character password, I was able to connect other devices to the WiFi extender.  No where in the set up is there an option to choose your own password.The signal is great but the set up is unreasonably difficult!!

  Got this for mom's senior apartment to use the community WiFi to run her MagicJack+ with her phone number.  There's some YouTube videos on how to get it to work.  You need a computer to program the extender if you don't have physical access to the router (we didn't; we only have the WiFi password), but now months later the only hardware in mom's room is this extender, the MagicJack+ and the phone.  Gambled $30 that it would work and it sure does.  Buying another one for our house so we can move the home phone (also on MagicJack) away from our router and ditch the cable that wraps around the room.

  Not only is it difficult to connect, once a connection is made, the signal only lasts a few seconds--even when it's right up against the main router. It's too late to return because I spent several weekends following all the directions in the manual and online with no success until I used the connection wizard on my iphone.

  I bought this because there's a wifi dead spot in my bedroom.

I could connect to my wireless network, but I would only get 1-2mbps, which is not enough for Netflix. This little device did solve my problem, and I now get a decent connection with about 25-30mbps (I get ""up to 200mbps"" for my main connection, normally around 180) . The setup didn't exactly go smoothly though. I kept getting error messages and trying again, and I was ready to give up and send the thing back, but it turned out that despite the errors, the setup had worked at some point.

  In my apartment, the only working cable outlet is in my bedroom at the one end of the apartment while the living room is at the other end.  It's a pretty long distance.  My wireless router's 5G signal fades drastically due to the thick walls in between the 2 rooms.  Normally, if I have strong wifi signal, the download speed hovers around 110 mbps.  But when I go to my living room, I'll be lucking to pickup any signal.Solution, I bought a wireless router. Didn't do much research and didn't want to spend much money so I went with this.  Easy installation (just plug it in) and their website makes the software setup very easy.Pros:- It works.- Easy setup.- Extended my wifi signalCons:- It did cut my internet speeds.  Went from 110 mbps to 70 mbps.- Looks funny.The drop in the internet speed was not a big issue to me. I expected it and the speed I have now is still good for streaming and gaming.  Plus, the extender was needed to bring signal to an area that barely had it. Anything speed 30 mpbs would've been acceptable to me. If I were to use this extender for a wider coverage area, the speed reduction might have been a bigger issue. But I don't so it's not.  Overall, I'm happy with it.

  The product was easy to install. Plug in near to the router so you can pick up the signal, activate, and log on to the new wireless network using the password for your router.  The final location for the device is where the signal is weak. There are extraneous instructions which may be designed for alternate (older) network configurations. The instruction manual refers to a link for technical support. Unfortunately, the rep on that line was more interested in selling me a security product than helping me interpret the instructions.  I suggest that you call Netgear directly for help.

  I suppose when  something is difficult to set up and use but then works well that's a good thing.  I had trouble setting up this extender because I just don't think the instructions are current and up-to-date.  I didn't even think it was working well until much later after it was set up and installed but it seems to be working very well.  I have a very small house and for some reason my modem signal doesn't reach my bedroom very strongly.  I got the extender to capture the signal from the modem and send in a line to my bedroom so that both my smart Roku tv and my laptop on my desk get a strong enough signal to operate properly.  They seem to be working much better using the extender.

  I am not a networking person, but I needed to expand mine.  I purchased it to extend my dual band network.  I had just installed a Ring Pro doorbell camera and I needed a stronger network outside my front door.  I picked the AC750 as a compromise between speed and price.  The setup instructions (I used the WPS buttons) were on the money except for two things.  First, they didn't say how long steps would take after pushing buttons.  It takes longer than I expected. It probably took less than a minute for each step, but it felt like 5.  So don't panic and after each press of a button, give it time to do it's thing.  Even plugging it in and waiting for the power light to stop flashing and turn steady green takes time. Second, to finish the setup, they tell you to open a browser to ""mywifiext.net"".  Guess again, I tried my cell phone and my laptop and keep getting error messages.  After Googling ""mywifiext.net"" I found 192.168.1.250 as the extender's address.  Type that in your browser and your all set.  One last thing.  When I tried to register it with my phone and I got ""error 404"" every time.  So I gave up and tried my laptop.  It worked perfectly.  I got it registered without a hitch.  I connected my doorbell to the extender and it has worked great.

  Recent update to my extender has me removing all the netgear extenders from my network.  After a a year of mostly flawless service my Netgear extender, I tried reconnecting to it. It  kept forcing me to Login to a netgear management site,  You have to create an account if you want to manage your devices through the app.  It allows you to bypass this but it routed you right back to the Netgear Login when you try to connect.  Originally, setup involved login directly to the extender and giving it the home router name, security settings and password and your were done. Now it force you to the new management app when trying to connect by phone.  Directly plugging into  an Ethernet didn't help bypass this step and  still sent me to the website to sign up for the online management.  So even if the you want to use it, you have to register it and store your router name and password in your account.  I was going to do it just to see if it was useful enough to be worth the effort.  Two different phones tried to create and account and logon to set it up and  it just tries without ever connecting.  Tried for an hour to get it set up and never could login.  It probably is the same for my other netgear extender that suddenly stopped working asking me to login to their network.  I have TP-Link extenders that currently setup like this one used to.  So i may go get some more of those or start using old routers as extenders again.  I don't know if there is a way to roll back the version and prevent updates but I'll research that too.

  Love the easy of logging into this and extending your wifi.

  Bought this to extend our wifi to our office so I can plug my work laptop which I can't use wifi on, and hid it in my heavy wooden desk, which normally can degrade wifi signal quite a bit, but the speed test with my laptop plugged into it via ethernet cable shows it's still about 80% as fast as direct connection (ethernet again) to cable modem/router in other room!  If that was confusing, I just meant to say you can use it to get a wired connection to a device just using your wifi signal to this amazing device and/or you can use it to extend your wifi signal much further.Using the WPS button you can connect it to your main router just by pushing it on each device, which connects to the 2.4 ghz signal, and do same process again for it to connect to the 5 ghz network, if your router is broadcasting one.  Then using the web interface, you can tweak setting and make sure its all good.(My only gripe is that the app to access this device and find best locations etc. is as of March 2018 avail only for Android, not iOS, which hopefully they will have soon.)I bought an off-brand version of this and it was a total nightmare to try to get to work.

  The device works well and setup was easy. Some reviewers seem to be confused by the instructions, but I found them to be clear and useful. Setup on a WPS network required less than 5 minutes, and my wireless devices connected easily by setting up the pair of new networks (2.4ghz & 5ghz) as a wi-fi on each device. Again, very simple.Performance of the extender has been good after about a week of use. The home in which I live has an odd collection of walls that seem to make the existing wi-fi signal weak in certain areas of the house. The extender appears to be making these cold spots disappear, which was required because I work from home and use the Google Fi phone service over wi-fi. The extender was purchased to eliminate dropped calls resulting from these cold spots. So far so good, although more testing over a longer term will allow me to assess the product and quality.  Also, the NetGear app can be used easily to test the strength of your existing, and new, wi-fi signal in various areas of your house/business. The app helped me place the extender in the most efficient position to provide a solid signal throughout the house.

  Based on all the reviews it seems this product is hit or miss. For me it was a miss. The setup instructions are simple so when that doesn’t work where do you place the blame? WPS is a simple method to setup any device. Push button on router then push button on extender. But what happens when that doesn’t work? You troubleshoot. I have a Netgear router so communication should be transparent. I mean you can’t blame it on compatibility. So maybe the button on the router isn’t working. In Netgear you can log into the router to do WPS. They call it soft button. Immediately it lets you know it is having problems communicating with the extender. Ok, hard reset the extender. No joy. Give up on trying WPS which was the recommended way. Try the software setup. Some success but not total. After a few hours you have to ask yourself is it worth it? Seriously it shouldn’t be this difficult. I mean we haven’t even tried to tweak any settings. So all the reviews that were a hit, congratulations you were lucky to get a good unit.So if you’re feeling lucky take a swing. Amazon has a great return policy if you miss.

With my laptop within 10 ft unobstructed to the extender, I can connect to the router on 2.4 and get a 5 bar full strength connection to the extender.  Nevertheless, within 15 minutes (often less), the extender will lose that ability to get internet access.  This occurs despite continuing to indicate 5 bar full strength connection from laptop to extender AND continuing to have constant ""green"" (strong) connection indicated from the extender to the wireless router.I returned the unit to Amazon for exchange (Amazon's return procedure was very smooth, easy, and quick.  The replacement unit was delivered to me within 48 hours of clicking the link to return).  I just got the replacement a few hours ago.  I followed the set up instructions just like the first time.  This time the unit seems to work.

  When this extender works, it works great. The problem is that it often spontaneously stops working. Sometimes a reboot gets it going again, sometimes not. I contacted customer support and they had me upgrade the firmware. That worked for a while, so I didn’t return this product. But now that I can’t return it, it’s back to having the same problem again. Do not purchase this product - it’s far more trouble than it’s worth.

  100% waste of money. Wrongly Marketed . This will not extended your network, it makes you create NEW networks. This of course makes you redo the sign-in for any devices you want to use, so now the devices can't decide whether to link with the original network or try another. A huge pain in the ass to set up as it is not really plug n play. If you don't at least run a Real laptop you'll never get it linked up right. Negative 5 stars

  I just took this out of my network.  It got me though some time, but really it did not completely solve my connection to a wifi access coming in from the garage.  My impression, again having not tried this before, was it just brings more channels on the air locally which was the problem in the first place.

  I bought two of these to extend our Wi-Fi range into our driveway and onto our deck, where the signal was spotty and inconsistent.  I've only explicitly tested the results out on the deck, but I was really very impressed with the improvement.  I sat out on the deck with the iPad for hours, streaming music videos from YouTube, with barely a drop or a delay, and immediate recovery from the rare delay.  Prior to installing the extenders, it was rare to get through one video without interruption of some kind, and a bit of fussing to try and ""kick start"" the Wi-Fi signal again.Regarding installation: installing one is very easy.  The process literally takes just a few minutes and you're good to go.  I installed two, and could have benefited from a warning or information explaining how these work.  The installations went exactly as described in the instructions, but the instructions fail to mention that, when you install the second one, it'll broadcast the same SSID names as the first, and you won't be able to tell which is which.  It's not a huge deal, but consider this: each extender broadcast two new SSIDs.  My Android phone showed two pairs of duplicate SSIDs under Wi-Fi network selection, while the iPad showed just the two unique names.  Even on the Android, where you saw four entries, you could not tell which entry came from which extender.  Never having used extenders before, I don't know if there's a benefit to the two extenders using the same SSID names.  It would not seem so, considering they broadcast separate SSIDs and you have to explicitly choose one SSID to connect to on any device.  I doubt the shared name makes the connection somehow dynamic.  On the other hand, using different names for their respective SSIDs, you can easily differentiate each extender's signal strengths and you know for sure which extender you're connected to.  Anyway, long story short: my advice for those considering multiple extenders would be to give each new SSID a unique name so you're able to differentiate them later, if you have to troubleshoot any problems.  That is, unless you find information in support of a shared name, in which case please respond back here with a comment!

  We have a rather small house-- 1500sf. Bought this to help extend our wifi range. We continued to have issues-- even with a computer being 10 feet from it (there was a small wall between the extender and our computer) so we had Spectrum service out and the tech advised that this brand is known to be basically useless. He recommended a few other for us to consider and we purchased one that he recommended on amazon and it works GREAT. Don't waste your money on this one-- we weren't even able to get 50mbps with it even though we have over 500mbps coming into our house.

    Disappointing speeds for NETGEAR WiFi Range Extender EX3700 - Returned
  
",2.0 ,ojr83,"Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2020","









  
  
    
  Purchased this product to extend the WiFi signal to my front living area and garage.  I was not very impressed with the output speeds of this WiFi Extender; speeds are severely inferior when compared to your normal router.  your speeds are cut to LESS than half of your main router.  I ran several tests, all of which produced similar results.  Tests ran from kitchen table, which is 10 feet from NETGEAR WiFi Extender and 15 feet from my router.  The first 2 screenshots are the results ran from the NETGEAR WiFi Extender's 2.4GHz and 5GHz dual bands.  The second set of screenshots are the results from my router, which is also NETGEAR brand.  I will probably be returning this item and looking for a better product.  As far as the distance it extends to is approximately 800 square feet at my house, but the signal is harshly cut off by a my front (brick) wall.  In my garage, the reception is fine, but again the speeds are not what I expected.Update:  I returned the product.  Netgear replied to my original review post instructing me to visit their troubleshooting page which I'm glad I did not do as some of the other reviews here state that when they did that, they were engaged by ""tech support"" for a charge or a ""bait and switch"" .

  I am not a tech person.  I never write reviews, especially negative ones.  But I am this time.The extenders would not connect to my system.  During an ""online chat"" with the company in an attempt to connect the extenders, I was sent to a third party tech support person.  He ""identified"" the problem as my system.  For an additional fee, they could ""fix"" my IP addresses and the extenders would work.  I was willing to pay the extra $300 for tech service if I was going to have thorough wireless service throughout my home.  Unfortunately, this did not happen and I would prefer that I just tossed the extenders in the garbage and did not proceed with any connection efforts.While the person was very friendly, helpful and seemed knowledgeable, after we disconnected our conversation the extenders did not work.  They did work while he was on the phone with me.  I called back after a couple of hours and got another tech.  He ""fixed"" the extenders again for me.  Once he disconnected, again they did not work.  Since I had connected my systems to the extender wireless accounts with the first tech, none of my devices would work.  I spent hours not only on the phone with the tech people but also reconnecting my devices to a wireless service that would work.  Frustrating does not fully encompass my feelings here.I am out $375 and have two extenders that do not provide any additional wireless coverage for my home.  The time and money spent, while frustrating, are not the issue here.  The extenders do not work in my home.  Why?  I have no idea.  But it was not for a lack of effort on my part both timewise and financially.  I would caution anyone who is not thoroughly tech savvy to not buy this product.  Unless you have a way different experience than I did, they will not connect easily to your router and you will spend time and money chasing ghosts.

  Picked this up after being told to work from home. The set up was easy enough following the instructions. I use the wired ethernet port for my work computer and generally this extender does fine even with a PS4, smart tv and a couple phones picking it up as well. I was hoping to hit my garage/shop with it as well but barely has the strength to make it for the tv and xbox there. It has been functional for my work purposes as I generally am connected to a few cloud systems for file storage and using outlook via a vpn through work. It's not fast by any means but serves my purposes. My signal strength issues come entirely from placement and distance from my Nighthawk to the extender and then to the shop. I was not looking to spend a lot of money at the time of purchase due to the work from home supposedly only to be a month or 2. 8 months later and this little extender is still serving the purpose. If you want to have speeds to be close to your primary router and span longer than one end of the house to the other, get a pricier model. If you are just looking set up in another part of the house with an access point for work, this is fine.Reading other reviews, there appears to be some quality control issues as a fair amount of purchasers complain that it does not work at all or it has burned up in a short amount of time. Mine worked out of the box and I have never had to contact tech support at all. I may still wind up going with a stronger model when I also upgrade the main router as kids doing school from home, working from home and trying to hide out in the shop on occasion seems to be a bit beyond the capabilities.

I asked to speak to someone that could simply answer a few questions on setting up a router and he said Netgear does not provide people to talk to for free. I then called a different number I found online, also for Netgear, and I could barely hear him because there were so many people talking in the background. Then he hung up on me. I tried calling back but it was no use. I am now left with a product that I cannot set up (the directions are quite unclear and inadequate) and have no choice but to send it back.

Now I can stream TV on an IPAD, run data on my IPHONE and RUN a MAC all on the same wifi network via the extender.  AMAZING!  Poorly documented by Netgear but once you turn on Fastlane this device WORKS GREAT!

  I have had this device for about two years now.  Up until now it has worked great.  It provided coverage to my living room which is on the other side of the house from my router.  But recently it has been dropping the signal and I've been having to unplug and plug it back in to get it to reset.  That doesn't last long before it starts messing up again.  I'm thinking about getting a mesh system now.

    Your private Wi fi in any public area with a wall plug

  his unit allows almost anyone to use a non secure public wi fi to create your own secure wi fi- internet connection !Background- live in a  100 room apt complex which provides "" free wi fi "" part of rent on both a so called secure system and a ' public’ no password system.  But due to incompetent local ' gurus' that administer system-both use same network for their 2ghz / 5ghz access points- so anyone outside within 30 to 50 yards or more  can see and access those who use names, non secure printers, cellphones, etc.  breaking passwords is unfortunately quite simple nowadays since older generation types do not keep up with updates, need for long passwords, etc.  With a relatively simple setup and using the poorly located ‘ repeaters” ( access poInts ) as ‘your’ router, and inputing your own SSID and password, you can make a reasonably private link to the internet for the one time cost of the unit.Dont know yet about there long term reliability- but with the large number of positive reviews, I am assuming it is good.  Upon opening my unit a few days ago, when i connected it it notified me of a new update.  Suggest that one wait until you have it setup and running in your location before downloading the update- other wise a complete reset may be needed.Of course if you have a router and ethernet, that can also be used to create a new SSID.And it appears to be much cheaper extension then  the ‘ xfinity” pucks and useful for all but the most dedicated gamers.  MY wi fi rates went from20 to 30 Mbps to over 200 even with a marginal ( yellow-red ) input from the apt network wi fi  - your milage  will vary.And even knowing the IPv4 address of my extender, I could not using an iPad/laptop find the name or access it on the Apartment network. ( of course a dedicated hacker could probably do so- but why  if my SSID is something like ‘COWPLOP”  or “HURL38 “ instead of  joe slow ?

  This thing has definitely increased my home's internet range, but it was not as easy to set up as pushing a button. For some reason the extender just wasn't connecting to my WiFi. Fortunately, I stumbled across the NetGear website's online chat while trying to troubleshoot my issues, and the representative promptly set up a call for tech support to call me back within 5 minutes. It probably took 20 minutes on the phone with the guy to work it all out, but everything is great now. I never would've been able to figure out the issues without tech support, though!

  I purchased the AC750 back in March 2019, all seemed well at first. The device setup was fairly standard for an extender, and was able to get it connected to my network within a couple minutes.As of this review(6-25-19), the warranty on the product ended about four days ago, and as of this morning the device has simply ceased to work properly. I've attempted multiple resets of the network as well as the extender (Factory resets included), and despite my efforts the best the device will do is output a ""Connected"" signal, but refuse to grant internet access. For those of you interested in obtaining a range extender, I'd warn to pass this one up, as it seems its lifespan is only limited to its warranty.

  Originally I gave this product 5-stars, because it was working as promised, and the prior raters had pretty much all given it strong positive reviews. With the passage of several months, it became apparent that the unit is crap. I just got of the phone from a Kafkaesque-like, 30-min run-around, from Netgear's Philippine (?) call-center. It would seem that they are not very interested in replacing the unit within the 1-year warranty. My unit simply stopped working after about 4 months, and nothing in terms of the troubleshooting that was done made any difference.  It took some time, but it became quite clear that no 'return authorization' was to be approved. Steer clear. Buy another manufacturer's product. Needless to say, I'M VERY DISSATISFIED.

  The product is extremely frustrating to work with and performs terribly.I get better speed from directly connecting to my router all the devices I have tried (multiple laptops, phones, other desktop wifi adapters, tablets).The setup process is also very tedious. E.g., if you miss the last step to confirm setup success (which involves waiting for the device to reboot, connecting to its SSID, and refreshing the config page), you will end up having to reset the device and start over. Also, even though it supports a wired connection, the setup _has_ to go through wifi. It's just all around extremely hard to work with.As one human to another, don't waste your time and money with this thing.

  Bought this to extend the range of my wifi from one end of an old home to the other, since I can't move the original router. The laptop and PlayStation I use frequently lose their connections to the extended network and default back to the barely-there signal from the primary router, which is really annoying.Edit: The extender started to fail periodically over the course of the last month, and is getting worse. I think it's overheating, but I'm not sure. Will try to contact the seller about potential warranty stuff.Edit 2: The seller wanted me to pay more than the product was worth to ship it back to them before they would offer a replacement. It's still overheating and occasionally cutting out after the factory reset and firmware updates they had me do.Edit 3: After a lot of back and forth with Netgear, they did eventually replace the range extender. The new one has the same problem as the old one, so either the model is unreliable or there's something about the environment that's causing the issue. I've raised my rating slightly to indicate that they're willing to work with people to some extent, and that the new one seems to drop my connection less frequently.

  Rather than a wifi extender, I purchased this to use as an access point. The router alone was not enough to grant strong signal everywhere in the house, with some rooms being almost a blindspot for the router. Now I have strong signal for the whole house.PRO:-has antennas. I can fiddle with them to improve coverage if needed. 801.22ac band normally doesn't have huge coverage, but I was able to get huge coverage. Yes, I meant 801.22ac, not 801.22n.-unused band can be disabled. Helps with reducing unnecessary wifi clutter that should have been expected to cause interferences.-adjustable coverage.CON:-took a while to set up my access point. This device took significant amount of time to apply settings when I did so.-too easily pressed buttons. As I was trying to set up this device, I accidently pressed the power button multiple times, which contributed to longer set up time.-a lot of heat. This is expected with such high wifi coverage however. Lowering coverage helps with heat issue if all that coverage is not needed.-occasional disconnects. If you use wifi settings on computer or phone to automatically connect, it is very forgivable issue.

I went from 2/3 bars to 5 bars on my laptop.-It was very simple to setup and I didn't have to worry about new passwords or network IDs.  The network ID will just be whatever it is now with a suffix of ""-ext"" and the password will not change.-It works with both 2.4 and 5 GHz, which many others did not.

  I ordered this because it is a dual band extender and I have a dual band router (a Google Fiber box, to be specific) and I wanted to boost the signal to some areas of my house where it has a hard time reaching. Setup was okay, but could be better. Not exactly plug and play. I ran into a few difficulties getting the webpage for the extender to load (not to mention the fact that it logs you out within like 5 minutes of no activity - really far too quickly if you are trying to do several things at once). Once I did that it took me several tries to find a spot in my house where the thing would actually pick up a signal from my router. I finally got that settled and managed to get the 2.4 Ghz band working just fine (which is the only reason I'm giving this 2-stars instead of just one).However, I ran into plenty of problems with the 5 ghz band. It simply refused to recognize that it was there at all. On the web page for the router it showed that it was there but wouldn't connect. I can log directly onto the 5 ghz band (on my original router) on my phone so I know it works. The 5 ghz extension appeared on my phone but when I would log on it would say there was no internet connection. On my laptop the 5 ghz extension didn't even show up as an option. I went online and searched forums for Negear and for Google Fiber and found that this is not an uncommon problem with this particular extender. However, after trying all of the suggestions on the forums I still couldn't get it to work - even when the extender was plugged in just a few feet from the router.Having run out of options I contacted Netgear support and after exchanging several e-mails with a person who was - bless him - trying to be helpful but obviously didn't speak English as a first language, he finally told me to return the product. All I want to do is extend the range of the wifi in my house. It shouldn't really be this complicated. I chose this product because of the majority of positive reviews it has.

  Package is easy.  Instructions are easy, for simple/normal setup.  I got this model b/c I'm looking to hide my SSID for extra security.  The SETEK extender I ordered before could not be configured as such (note SETEK refunded me 100% of my purchase plus tax for this trouble!  And I didn't have to return the unit!).So I looked up the instructions for Netgear before ordering, determining how to configure it with hidden SSID, feeding off my hidden SSID, and all using WPA2.  With such a config, I can't just hit the WPS button.  My hidden SSID on my main router invalidates that option.  I use Firefox as my std. browser.  First set up the extender using Firefox - I can use it to find my hidden SSID router, and it picks up and extends the signal.  Great!  Now to configure the repeater so it's hidden.  Followed the instructions, hit a dead end a few times.  Repeated several times.  Reset to factory settings once to start over.  Not sure what's going on.  Set up the link to the main router again.  Opened up the config page with MS Edge instead.  I think it took 2 times, and then finally got to the page to hide the SSID for the the repeater.  Phew!  Total time, maybe an hour and some stress.Now, so far so good.  It's been on nonstop for over a week, and fills in the wifi hole in the house in both floors.  Runs a little warm, but all the lights are green and no drop in signal.  Form factor is nice b/c I can plug into the lower socket, and the upper is still accessible.5 stars for the hardware.  5 stars for the flexibility options in configuration.  3 stars for the erratic behavior of the setup page, and getting to the options I want, and consistency against the online instructions.  Hopefully I won't have to touch it again for a while.

    Definite Drawbacks

  The EX3700 WiFi Range Extender is the first product from NetGear I’m not enthusiastic about. It works, but it works perhaps too well. It handles both the 2.4 and 5 GHz channels, but does so individually, and if your device links to it rather than your regular Internet gateway, it doesn’t switch between channels seamlessly, you have to do it manually. And WiFi speed is significantly slower through this device compared to my gateway’s speed. In addition, I can be in the same room with my gateway, and my iPhone or even my iMac will arbitrarily switch over to the NetGear booster, even though it’s 40 feet farther away than the wireless cable modem next to my desk! This thing definitely has range going for it, but it tries to simply take over my devices when it’s unneeded, and definitely unwanted when I need all the speed I can get. But hey, for the cost, it’s okay.

  The Netgear range extender works great for me. My modem is in living room downstairs and my office is upstairs. I used to have to run a cable down the stairs to the living room, but now the cable’s gone and I have a good clear signal to my office without the wire to trip over. Great deal for a great device. And, with the fantastic Amazon service!

  I could not use this unit.  I followed instructions and all the lites turned on and blinked as described, That is as far as it went even though my router WPS lite  was on and blinked.  It would not pair.I tried to call Netgear but no phone available until the unit was registered.  I registered at the Netgear site which informed me that registration was complete but they could not register the product. They gave me no explanation.  I had no further support  and no phone number to call.  The unit is being returned.I DID NOT RETURN:Contrary to my previous statement, my unit did get registered  After searching a bit on the bottom of the page was the support selection which appeared only after the unit was registered.  I chose CHAT line for help.  They were very helpful.  They spent much time with me because I was a slow learner. With much patience, and I am sure a great deal of restraint, They helped me step by step to set up my unit.  Looking back, It was a very easy process to follow.  It should be no big deal for anyone with even the slightest bit of technical WiFi knowledge to set up in about 5 or 6 minutes.  Obviously,  I rate this 5 STARS and not the 1 Star I gave originally.

  Super easy setup--true push-button simplicity, and bingo, my reception problems were solved. Extended coverage exactly as promised in the manufacturer's illustration on Amazon page.  Before installation, my regular wifi router's signal could not get past my central chimney, so the front of my house had great wifi but the back half was weak, and the back corner had none (a central chimney perfectly blocked it).  With the Netgear AC750 mounted in the center of the house (in a location not blocked by the chimney, but just beyond it) it accepts my ""old"" signal (which travels through a few thin walls to the Extender's location) and then bathes the whole house (and back yard) with a new dual-band signal.  It is particularly nice to have the 5GHz signal because it is a much less congested band (most neighbors are gumming up the works in the 2GHz bands)

  I live in a remote area where I have limited Internet access. The wireless router I use just didn't keep a connection in the opposite end of the house where my computer is located. In desperation I ordered this extender and plugged it into an outlet in the computer room and the problem was solved. I recommend this extender, and I also recommend to anyone buying one that they read other reviews that go into detail on how to set it up. It is really easy to set up, but as others have commented, you need to use a tablet instead of a desktop computer to do it and the directions that come with the unit aren't totally clear on that.

  Once installed this worked great. I bought it for my mother who is 72. She is still pretty tech savvy for 72. She could not get it too connect she called netgear who told her unless she bought a 300 dollar firewall it was never going to connect because she had a bunch of unknown IP addresses on her computer.  Well yes she did and that is now taken care of,  however the extender connects to the router not the computer so this was a blatant attempt to have her pay for something she did not need in order to make this product work. When she told them she could not buy the netgear version she was told then she needed to go to best buy and get something or it was never going to work.  It literally took less than 5 minutes for the cox service rep to walk her through pushing the button on her router to make it work.  I would have returned this she didn't want to mess with doing a return.

    Netgear AC750 Wifi Extender hits the mark!
  
",5.0 ,Tim Marquart,"Reviewed in the United States March 21, 2017","









  
  
    
  So overall, I give this Netgear AC750 WiFi Range Extender 5 stars for doing a solid job extending my home wifi to my farthest room, maintaining solid speed and providing a full 3 bars of wireless connectivity, all at a low price.Here's some feedback on a few key areas:Size/quality -- very small, plugs into the bottom plug in a 2-plug, standard outlet and leaves room to plug in another item above it (no problem).  Material quality seems to be quite good, nice materials, clear lettering/labeling, buttons have a good tactile feel to them.  Don't forget to peel off the thin, transparent film over the front panel.Setup -- a bit ""glitchy""... 2 options for setup, WPS mode (the ""easier"" one) and with Web Browser setup.  I tried WPS mode and despite following directions, the unit would not establish a connection with the router.  SO, as directions state, I tried the ""Connect with Web Browser"" mode.  This seemed to go ok, but in a couple spots, it seemed to glitch a bit when following directions, but after some ""extra"" time (15 min?), I skipped one of the steps and it was able to complete the setup.  I was able to connect to both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands (as my Verizon FIOS router supported it).  This is good especially regarding speed (below).Speed/performance -- so overall very pleased with this area... there's an upstairs room in my house that's farthest from the router, and wireless can vary there from very occasionally a full 3-bars, to occasionally 2-bars, to typically 1-or-2 bars, to sometimes 1-bar, to occasionally 0 bars (""your iPad is not connected to the internet"" -- ugh).  Here are the results I saw (based on speedtest.net average of 3 tests per setup):  Original/optimum wireless (iPad 3-ft from router) -- Ping = 9ms; Download = 25 Mbps; Upload = 29 Mbps  Original wireless in farthest location in house -- Ping = 10ms; Download = 8 Mbps; Upload = 9 Mbps  AC750 Extender 2.4GHz band in farthest location -- Ping = 10ms; Download = 21 Mbps; Upload = 19 Mbps (full 3 bars wireless strength)  AC750 Extender 5GHz band in farthest location -- Ping = 12ms; Download = 33 Mbps; Upload = 20 Mbps (full 3 bars wireless strength)So you can see that the AC750 Extender significantly improved Download speeds (vs. original wireless), nearly 4x for the 5GHz band, and doubled the upload speed (all compared to performance in the same physical location at the farthest spot from the router).  Just as important, the wireless strength was a full 3 bars with the extender, whereas my original wireless is quite weak there and occasionally drops completely (""Your iPad is not connected to the internet""... hate that!).I would definitely recommend this product and purchase again, especially considering the performance for the inexpensive price.

    No support, poor 2.4GHz speeds, not very configurable, but cheap.

  It has a very easy to use interface, but it doesn't always work. And, it wont give you any error message when it fails. So, if it seems to setup OK, but doesn't work, just try again. It is a little bit annoying that there is no error message, but at least you can still get it to work. Maybe a quarter star penalty.The 5GHz band works well for me, but not the 2.4. Anything that uses it is just slow. If I try their 'fastlane'  technology, then it is slow like 2.4. This technology is supposed to combine the two frequencies to make it faster than either, not slower. By slow, I mean ar least as slow as the router I am trying to extend, even though I am much closer to the extender.  I wonder if something is wrong with the radio. If it is a rare issue, maybe half a star. If it is normal, then two stars.So, I contact Netgear support with my question. They immediately responded with silence. A couple weeks later they remain silent. So, I guess that I just have to return it, and hope the replacement is better?Another technical issue is that this extender changes the mac address of the client. This screws up the DHCP server of my fancy firewall/router. My previous ancient router flashed with Dd-wrt, and set up to be a repeater did better than this thing at 2.4GHz.I guess that the positives are small, not ugly and cheap? At least it sort of works for 5GHz. Nonexistent support.Update: I returned it and got another one. It worked better. I finally got the fastlane technology to work well. However, it started disconnecting. After some homework and testing, I figured out that it does not work on all channels of 5GHz! When my main router switched to one of these channels, the netgerlar extender (3700) could no longer see the router. So, now I have to manually set my router channel, and hope that the environment does not get crowded around it.

  Bought this to get a little more range into my front yard. I read into this before buying so I knew what it does and doesn't. It works like a repeater, it will only put out what it is taking in, so if it gets poor connection in, it'll extend a poor connection out. I knew that already. And it works good actually as far as extending the available range I already have. My problem is, it keeps disconnecting and I have to turn it off every few days and reboot it and re-set it up every few days. Really irritating. The reason I bought it was to extend range to the front yard so I can connect my wireless surveillance to my base station. It works great and gets reception out in the front yard now, so my camera works, but the problem is when this ""extender"" fails every few days, so does my surveillance because the base is connected to the extender. So when extender fails, my cameras don't record. That's not good for my home security system as my family and I rely on those cameras to work all the time to monitor our property. Looks like I am past the return period too, oh well, a worthless paper weight now. Time to look for something better.

  Very easy to set up -- took less than 5 minutes.  My smart TV had been at the fringe of my 2.4Ghz coverage zone and beyond my 5Ghz coverage zone.  Now solid signals for both from my new extended networks: my TV uses the 2.4Ghz extended network and my Roku uses the 5Ghz extended network, with absolutely no problems (ie, no stops for buffering).  (Previously, the TV and Roku were using the 2.4Ghz network and stopped to buffer once every 10-30 min.)  I have 100 mbps internet service.  When I do speed tests on  the new 5Ghz extended network, it is typically 50 mbps, or about half of what my 5Ghz network provides -- just as advertised.  My new 2.4Ghz extended network provides about 20 mbps, only slightly less than the 25mbps that my 2.4Ghz original network provides.  Plenty for all of the streaming services.

",3.0 ,Tzwol,"Reviewed in the United States July 19, 2020","I know the drill. ""I can't get WiFi in my bed room."" ""My garage doesn't have a signal."" ""the router is in the basement."" This little device will merely do half the job it's supposed to. Now if you're looking for an actual FIX. I would suggest a Mesh Router system. I will explain why.

Extender (the one you're looking at):
Pros:
Cheap
Simple set up (usually just a 2 button set up)
Kind of works
Cons:
Will act as another device on network(this will take up massive amounts of bandwidth and slow down your network)
Is a bit of an eye sore
Does not usually extend a STRONG signal.
The 5ghz never worked on my device. (Even knowing I set it up correctly)
You may be connected only to your network or this extender. One must manually switch between.

Mesh WiFi:
Pros:
Extends signal
More stylish designs (can look like a lamp, ern, vase, etc.)
Reconnects devices to other routers on a whim
Able to prioritize traffic and avoid too many devices on one
Able to route super strong signals
Able to route both 5 and 2.4 very well between each unit
Same username password to connect to all
Usually has an app to help set up
Set up takes about 5 minutes (same as extender)
Cons:
A little pricier
Can occasionally come with more units than you need.

I stand by my RockSpace mesh routers. As of now I have set 2 families and a business up with them. They love them. Regularly around $180, but sometimes can be snagged for $130 for a deal on Amazon. I have no affiliation with them, I'm sure
Google, Eero, or lynksys has great ones too, but not for a deal like that. Anyways, look more into it if you don't believe me. It will future proof you. Have a good day!",Model: WiFi Extender AC750

This device repeats both my 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands successfully and I was able to get my connection speeds up in my work nook up to ~10 Mbps (up from ~1 Mbps) by plugging in this device about halfway between my nook and my WiFi router - and that's pretty much all I bought this thing to do, so I'm quite happy with this purchase.

Now I am stuck with two NetGear extenders and neither of them work.  Cannot return the 1st purchase because that window has closed but the 2nd one is going back to Amazon.  VERY DISAPPOINTED to say the least.

  Due to the coronavirus I am on mandatory telework. I'm an engineer. I was sent home with my big Linux workstation that had no wifi card, only ethernet, for connectivity, but the only place I could put it in my house was far away from my home's network router. I followed the instructions to set up the wifi (basic and 5G signals) just as the video on the product page showed using the WPS buttons on my router and the extender. The only difference is it took a little longer for the device to boot up than the video led me to believe. Once it was ready, everything went smoothly. I plugged the extender into an outlet near my computer, powered it on and connected an ethernet cord to my workstation. The workstation was already configured for DHCP, so no changes were necessary. Using this extender was completely transparent to my Linux OS and I needed no administrator privileges to get online. (If the ethernet port wasn't configured for DHCP, I think I would have needed either admin privileges on Linux or a non-default configuration for the extender.)I haven't noticed any speed problems, but I'm connecting to work over a very strained VPN to which I currently attribute most of the lag when it occurs.

  Wow.... Just wow.... I gotta say this is one solid device overall, it's very small and I'm just amazed at how well it performs. I love that it doubles as both a wireless router and a hardware connection! The best part is it can use the 5ghz broadband that my modem has! Love the speeds I don't lose any speed at all and it connects flawlessly to my main modem, in my room which has quite a few walls before reaching my main modem I only get about 1-2 bars and sometimes while streaming it'll just go back to my LTE service without warning and it starts using my phones data. I hated that, and here's an idea of how far my room is from my modem, I have to go through the laundry room past the garage door, to the kitchen and through the kitchen is the dineing room and past that is the living room where the modem is. So yea it's quite aways away lol. However this device had no problem hooking up with the WPS button. And upon doing it a second time I connected to the 5ghz for way better speeds. Now as we know 2.4 vs 5ghz speed there is a significant difference in how fast data is transferred. However at the cost of length  you'll get better speeds meaning to take advantage of the 5ghz speed you'll have to be closer to the modem, as opposed to 2.4 where you can be farther but get less speed. This isn't an issue with this nifty device as it can be moved virtually anywhere there is an outlet. I considered my room a dead zone as I couldn't get good signal I ended up running a 100ft car cable to an external wireless router just to get wifi in my room but it was unrealizable because of its own gateways and settings that prevented the services to work correctly. However with this wall adapater it mimicked my main modems settings including password! So it's like me being in the living room by my modem 24/7. I was lucky enough to get this product when it was on sale, I would definitely pay full price for it if I had to for this kind of reliability.

  Initially worked fairly well at extending signal to our kitchen, but not great.  A few months ago we found that at times, we would have to switch devices to the main router because the signal from the extender would get “lost”.  This week, after 22 months, it completely quit.  No signal, no lights, and when went to unplug it, it was very hot.  My greatest happiness is that I discovered the problem before it caused a fire.

  While this is easy to install, it's all downhill from there.For this kind of product, I suppose that your mileage will vary greatly based on where you plan to use it. I was hoping to get it to cover a 2 bedroom apartment. The router is on one end, and the WiFi just didn't reach to the other side. So I put it somewhere that consistently has good signal. Now, sitting on the other side of the apartment, yes, my devices clearly are connected to the network this device creates, but the connection is incredibly, unbearably slow and inconsistent. Forget any sort of streaming, even basic websites can be a struggle.Occasionally it will decide that it does want to do its job, and then for a second all is well, but it will soon go back to its normal speeds, or better yet, the extended network disappears entirely for a while, or devices connected to it will claim there is no internet access. How this can happen when the device is plugged in in a place with perfect connection is beyond me.Seriously disappointed. Unless I discover there's a solid piece of lead in the walls that would justify this poor performance, I can't recommend it.

I use it mainly to connect a couple security cameras and my irrigation system. However, it the the default wifi signal in our master bedroom so we use it on our phones often and i have noticed no lag in normal use on my phone, i.e. email, instagram, facebook, web browsing, etc. And while i rarely stream video on my phone, i have no doubt that it could handle this as well. For signal strength, i put the Netgear in 2.5ghz mode rather than dual band as it has a slightly better range and still provides ample speed. I average about 120 Mbps in my bed coupled with 100 Mbps service. Would Definitely recommend

  This is a $26 extender, and I think some of the reviewers are expecting too much from it. We moved into a larger house and the router that came with our fiber internet wasn't good enough for a strong signal in the bedrooms, so before spending hundreds on a mesh system we decided to try this extender first, and it does the trick just fine.Set-up is somewhat time-consuming but not hard if you follow the directions. I learned to wait a minute or two after each step because sometimes it took that long for the right lights to show up. I set up 2g and 5g and they both work fine.If you're a gamer this may not be powerful enough, but we can stream movies and video chat in the bedroom through this extender, so we're happy with it.

  I bought this extender because my Vizio smart tv kept dropping signal while running Netflix.  I decided on the dual band model because I'm computer illiterate and didn't do any research before hand.  Turns out, if you don't have a dual band router you don't need a dual band extender regardless of what the advertisement says about the speed differences of the extender itself.  The 2.4G model would have worked just fine...you live, you learn.1) I bought new and not refurbished so it came well packaged and with an easy to follow instruction book.2) After initial plug-in the power light turned Amber and took approx.  45 sec to turn green...be patient, it is working.2) Setup was very simple, just follow the directions.  If you have a password on your current wifi router, but no physical WPA button on the device then you will need your router's web based setup IP so you can connect the extender.3) I've been watching Netflix on my television for the past 90 minutes uninterrupted by signal drops.  I can't believe I didn't buy this sooner!

  I bought 2 of these to cover a somewhat sprawling one story house. One was new and the other refurbished.First the refurbished one came without any documentation and had not been reset thus contained previous owner's information.. Factory reset is pretty easy if you know how to do it but happy I had setup manual that came with the new one.Set it up with a T-P router and followed net-gear setup instructions. Both time using wps was at first a failure. Manual said push wps button on extender the push wps button on router. Never seemed to work. Did it backwards by pushing the wps button on the router first and it then connected with proper credentials.Access to the unit is only through the net-gear genie and ended up having to create two accounts (one for each extender) even though I had turned the first one off while setting up the second one.Once talking to the router I needed to update the firmware on the extender. That took a few minutes but occurred automatically with the Net-Gear setup Genie.At first throughput was very poor at less than 15 Mbps with router delivering 120 Mbps. Since I was not getting over 300 Mbps speeds from the router I switched the extender from auto to fast-lane settings. Had extender communicate 5 GHz with router and 2.4  GHz with clients. Voila! then getting 70-80 Mbps at connected clients which is plenty for my needs.So I would suggest1. Power up extender very close to the router.2. You can connect WPS but try both extender first (as manual says) and if the does not work try router WPS button first.3 If you can get by with less than 300 Mbps at your wireless client I would suggest using fast lane settings rather than auto 2/5 switching. For whatever reason my speed increase about 5-7X in the fast lane mode even though I was connecting at 2.4 rather than 5 GHz frequency. If you need speeds above 300 Mbps direct wired or wireless connection to the router probably is best.Edit: Dropping the review down to 2 stars because of difficulty in accessing the unit by browser when it exhibited erratic behavior. Only solution was to do factory reset and then go through the rather complex setup procedure again. I am returning the unit for a different model.

  Bought this to extend my wifi signal to the back of my house. Bought this because of good reviews. There are a few good things, namely: The user manual that came with this is really good and clear. Also, the web based setup for this is also really good. Very easy to setup. When it works, it works well. These are the only reasons I gave it 2 stars instead of 1.Now, the bad part: Worked for about 12 hours when first setup. Seemed great. Then, it just died. No internet at all. Had to unplug and plug it back in to get it working again. Then it worked for a couple more hours before losing internet again. Unplugged it again, plugged it back in, got it working. Worked for a few hours more - then died again. 3 strikes and you are out! I will be returning this item.I am a tech pro by trade so know how these things work. Important to give them a unique SSID different from your main router, as most devices are not smart enough to automatically pick the strongest signal. I was sure I was always connected to the extender. Also, the extender was located half way between my router and the back of my house - so it had a good signal, all lights were green. Unfortunately, these kinds of problems of dropping internet happen more often than not with these low budget extenders.All in all, well documented and easy to use, but subject to connection dropouts. Not worth the hassle of having to unplug/replug it every time it dies.

  UpdateI was so disappointed with the performance of this extender that I temporarily forgot why I originally bought it. I read an article about drops in bandwidth of routers causing excessive buffering and drops when putting more demand on it. Supposedly that could all be magically fixed with an extender. The one recommended was only 2.4ghz and I wanted one that was also 5ghz. I chose this one and for that it has been perfect. I went from having buffering issues a couple dozen times a day to zero times. I even run speed tests on my phone which used to immediately cause buffering issues and there's no effect.. I'm changing my rating from 1 star to 4 with the proviso that it NOT be bought to actually extend your network but to fix router bandwidth issues.I got this specifically to give me greater range with my existing SSID, hence *extender*. What they don't tell you is you must use a different SSID for the extender, defeating its whole purpose. That makes it another access point. As if that's not enough, I tested the speed from my normal router @ 167mbps versus the speed from the extender @ 29mbps. Where I place it had no effect. I tried changing the SSID to the same as my router but that locked me out of the extender since my phone wouldn't connect to the extender because of its low bandwidth. Avoid this.

The goal was achieved but I have strong feeling that this is temporary solution. Definite pro - the cost. Connection with the router is 3 out of 5, speed provided by 2.4ghz network is 3/5, speed on 5Ghz bandwidth - 1/5. Devices connected to the extender don't switch automatically to more powerful main network as you move form one area to another. I'm wondering if there is a way to make devices switch between networks intelligently.the bottom line - we are getting what we paid for, strong 3 out or 5.

  After about 9 months of light use, the 2.4g channel has stopped working on all devices (5g works fine).  I called Netgear technical support and they only offer complimentary support on this product for 90 days, after which they want you to pay for support.  I researched this issue online and found several posts with the same problem.  I have done a factory reset, firmware update and confirmed the settings are correct.  Netgear does offer a 1-year warranty but they require a return authorization number, which can only be obtained through technical support, which requires a paid subscription.  This doesn't seem ethical.  I would avoid this product and given the warranty/technical support catch 22, I will certainly be considering other manufacturers for future purchases.

  My main reason for getting this was due to a weak signal for my Ring door bell.  I also had very weak signal in one of our bedrooms, but I had procrastinated on that one for years.  I have an Apple 802.11ac router located in my office in the far corner of my house and it can't easily be relocated, so after reading reviews I decided to give this a try.  I should note that I am a Cisco certified Network Engineer for 20+ years, so I considered a lot of different options, many of which would have driven my wife crazy.You definitely need to let the wizard create the new SSIDs as you will run into issues trying to reuse the same one as your main router. I joined it to my wireless network and it created two additional SSIDs (myname_2GEXT, and myname_5GEXT).  I joined the Ring to the new SSID and took each of our mobile devices into the 'dead zone' bedroom and joined them to the new SSIDs as well.  The signal strength is now excellent throughout all of these areas.  We just have to make sure we've joined the new SSID when in that one bedroom.  That's not a deal breaker for me.  For geeks like me, RSSI dropped from -74 to -57 at my furthest corner.The price of extending the network is losing a bit more than half the speed, but I knew this coming into the project.  If you manage those expectations, you will be happy also.  I normally get 45-50 Mbps downloads on my main SSID.  Using this extender, it drops to 15-18 Mbps.  That's still plenty for streaming multiple Netflix programs at the same time.  It has the added benefit of essentially rate-limiting anything that I put on the new SSIDs, meaning that any devices that use the extended network cannot use all of my available bandwidth.  Unbeknownst to my kids, their games and downloads will never again ruin a conference call.I should touch on placement.  You need to put this closer to your main router than to the area you're trying to cover.  In my case it's only about 20' away from my router in the hallway.  Wireless signal strength is greatly affected by wood and even more so by glass and metal.  I suggest placing this no more than 1 closed door or 1 interior wall away from your router if possible.  When planning where to put it, pick the location that is most free from interference.  Most of my plugs are behind or under furniture, so that's why the hallway was chosen.I would buy this again.

  Super easy to set up and connect to my Netgear Nighthawk router. The bedrooms upstairs on the opposite end of the house are a dead zone for my router, which is why I needed an extender. I placed the extender in the hallway and it works really well when it is connected. It drops the connection about once or twice a week. I have to power it down and back up, and it reconnects right away. I'm not sure if disconnecting has something to do with where I plugged it in, or if there is a glitch in the unit itself. I haven't tried in a different outlet, because I don't really have any other outlets with a good line of sight to the affected bedrooms. When it is working, which is most of the time, it puts out a good solid signal. I haven't noticed any measurable speed loss. I get a better signal from the extender out in the garage than I do from my router.

  Connects fairly easy. Was not able to get Wps to link so I went to the net. Fortunately, you do not have to be sitting next to your route. I purchased this for my studio which is a whole separate building. WiFi at home was just not strong enough to go through block walls. That being said once I set up the account with Netgear it was a snap to get set up. However finding a outlet that will allow the devise proper conditions I have resulted to keeping it in the middle of the studio. It only shows orange or red lights for the signal strength but I will get full bars and no lag.There was a catch on set up so make sure to read the directions closely. There are 2 ways to set up.One allows you to extend the range and another is for a 2nd WiFi connection perhaps for guests that you may not want on your line.Otherwise this is a solid purchase.

  I'm not an IT expert, so I'll adhere to the KISS rule: keep it simple, stupid.  No special skills are required to set it up - the WPS buttons on the unit and the wireless router do most of the work.  For electronic stuff, the instructions are pretty clear and easy to follow.  I needed to extend the signal from the downstairs family room AT&T broadband router to the second floor where our desktop PC is located, and this extender does the job OK, but not great.The unit creates two new channels, one on the 2.4 GHz band and the other on the 5GHz.  To use the signals, you have to add your devices to the ""new"" networks.  The instructions identify them so that you can pick them out the others you'll pick up in your location.  There is a ""device"" LED on the extender that glows green when a device is using one of its channels.I downloaded the NetGear WiFi Analytics app on my Android phone to check the signal strength.  In our house, the signal was only marginally better, but usable.  Additional devices on the channel seemed to degrade the signal.Overall, the extender does the job, but in our house the improvement was marginal, at best.  Maybe a different model would have produced better results.

  After persisting with online support and trying different device placements (none were more than 2 rooms away from the router), I could not get a reliable wireless signal from this unit. We had to follow the online/browser-based installation workflow (the simpler installation method did not work with our wireless router), and after various downloads and searching around Netgear's support website, I just couldn't get the unit to work any better than what we had before (even when the wireless indicator showed 'green' - although it oftentimes turned orange or turned off altogether). In fact, my wireless connection dropped out far more often using the unit than when using the original wireless option - located in the basement, two floors and more than 50 feet away from my desk. The last thing I want to do is spend hours on the phone with tech support for something that should be so simple and straightforward, so I just packed it up and sent it back. I strongly suspect our problem is a function of the equipment and setup of our internet provider (Charter), which seems to be different to other providers, and I wonder if it's just not possible for these devices to accommodate all the different standards and designs available. It's a shame, because I thought Netgear was a reputable/reliable brand and this product initially appeared to promise a simple and quick solution to our problem. In the past, I've often been skeptical of highly-negative reviews, especially when most reviews are stellar, as with this product, so I'd strongly suggest giving this one a try, and if you have the time and patience to deal with online tech support, then good for you, but I'm already burned out with IT and tech issues right now, and don't have any more time for it.

Relocated to the finished basement, selected a plug more in the middle of the house and it's working great.  The real test will be to see if it holds up, and the reception stays in that area.

  It is very easy to setup and works but performance is just not there. We just needed little extra 20-30 feet of coverage to reach to our back room.We had to keep switching back to our router wifi and would get quicker responses than going through this extender. There seems to be a lag between this unit and our Asus router so the signal boost is a false sense of connectivity. It might be good as a cheap WAP but as an Extender it was more frustrating than it is worth. Also, it is not a mesh network so you have to remember to manually switch over to your 'SSID_ext'. Didn't try to mess with channels and naming the SSID the same our router, perhaps it would have worked.Since we did not want to run a cable for dedicated WAPs (and the whole point of this device) we just bought a newer stronger router all together = TP-Link AC1900, which was just enough of an upgrade without stepping into $200+ range of a router.

  This extends your wifi network by creating a new network. So if your network is MyWifi you will then have to create at least 1-2 other networks for 2g and 5g respectively. So you will end up with your original MyWifi network plus MyWifi_2g and MyWifi_5g or whatever you decide to name them. This is great for a stationary device like a desktop in another room or an AppleTV for example where you will set it to the new extended network and forget it. But with a device that is mobile like an iPhone it does no good as that device will not choose the fastest wifi connection for you. So for example, in my bedroom which is far from the ""MyWifi"" connection I connected my iPhone to the ""MyWifi_5g"" network and had a good signal. However, when I went down into my basement where my wifi router is, my iPhone was using LTE as it was still on the ""MyWifi_5g"" extended network! I thought it would all be the same network, so this really doesn't help me. I guess I need a mesh wifi network, but those are expensive. Otherwise, setup was a bit technical but not too bad. And overall this seems like a well built product. Just know what you are getting first!!

My husband told them he was unformfortable with that & would not grant them access. The tech then said he could walk us through the setup, which takes 40 minutes, but we would have to download a specific software & pay them $60. That's twice what we paid for the device!

I ordered the part from Amazon for the firestick but it is on backorder so I haven't been able to test that function yet. So far very happy. I will try on live TV and ethernet and post a followup.

  This little extender has continued to work well! I have it set up in a window of the guest house so it can reach the wifi signal over in the main house. It does drop the signal every once in a while, but it's hard to tell if it is the extender or the wifi (we live in a rural area). However, I am very pleased with this product and am glad I bought it. We would not be able to receive any wifi signal in the guest cabin if we did not have this extender, so it works exactly as it should.

  After reading the reviews I had high hopes for this. I received the item, brand new. Opened it up and tried to set it up, but it was asking for a password already. So I hit the factory reset - nothing changed. Did this about 10 more times before giving up and returning it, figuring it was a one-off and requesting a replacement.Second item arrived. I open it and it’s dusty- clearly used. And not only was it dusty but it also came with an unidentified cord which the original didn’t include, so clearly nobody had even opened it when they received the return and then mailed it straight out. Anyways, it requested a password which I expected, so I hit the factory reset. It was going smooth until after setting up my username, then the page crashed. Tried again, same thing. Tried again on a different browser, same thing. I gave up after that.

  I put this in the hallway of my house in between the living room and my bedrooms so they all of my bedrooms could have full signal. It has done a good job so far. The setup was very easy it's all in the book. When you plug it in the power light will be orange, just leave it alone for a sec and it will turn green on its own. You press the WPS Button on your router and the device and it should connect. You have to plug it in near the router for the setup and then move it where you want it. Great product so far.

  If you are extending a WPS wi-fi router you will experience a fantastically easy setup. My complaint is with the device's reliabilty. Mine burnt out in less than a month. I had 4 laptops, 2 desktop, 2 TVs and 2 or 3 cellphones running on it, sometimes all concurrently. About three weeks after purchase, my devices could connect to it. It could connect to the main router but my devices could no longer get to the Internet through it. And, the device itself was very warm to the touch. It may have been okay if stressed less. Other users also taxing their home network may want to be cautious of this product. I continue to trust Netgear however for low cost alternative network equipment. They are a good industry name for mass produced, low cost, mid-security, network products. For the price, I may get two more so I can split the load. I had a couple of the next lower quality models laying around and fell back to them when this product failed

Give the extender a chance to establish a solid link.  Product instructions are easy to follow.  Nice engineering at a low price making for good value.

  Worked fine after going through setup hiccups. I’m one of those that struggled with setting this extender up. I tried it the WPS way and the web browser way...neither worked. I left it alone and tried it again the next day. Still nothing. So, I registered my  device online and called Netgear support for help. After about 15-20 minutes on the phone with the representative, my extender was connected to my WiFi and I moved it to my desired location. I will say a few things about this. Some of the steps the representative took me through were not in the instructions. There was a lot of “resetting”, waiting 30 seconds here and there, then hitting this/that button and waiting 3-4 minutes, allowing for this/that button to light up or stop blinking, etc. It would have been nice if the WPS route had worked b/c it appears to be the easier one but customer support just took me straight to the web browser steps. It was frustrating at first, but I’m glad I got it connected!

  Bought two of these to use in conjunction with Netgear Powerline 1200 ethernet-via-house-electric-wiring modules. The Powerlines distribute the ethernet throughout the house, garage and patio, and these extenders connect to them with a short Cat 6 cord as access points to turn the ethernet into Wifi that covers my driveway, dock and 1.7 acre yard. Works like a charm and gets a better throughput (range and speed) than if I used the extenders alone to connect to my router via Wifi. Takes a couple minutes to configure.

  Pros:1) It is self-contained and plugs directly into the wall.2) The lights make it fairly clear what is happening. Does it have a solid signal to the router? Green.3) Setup was not too difficult. I've set up a lot of network equipment so it wasn't any trouble to figure out how to use WPS to connect with my router.Cons:1) The router light was almost always RED, even though it was just down the stairs from my main router.2) The WiFi connection would drop repeatedly during shows and sometimes we couldn't connect to it at all.The bottom line: Our wireless situation actually got worse after setting this up and all of us have switched back to using the main wireless router. I will be returning it but wanted to provide some information to you so you can make your own decision.

Contacting Netgear was a challenge; tech staff super polite, but insisted on confirming all product serial and address information they needed from me in repeat fashion, a for alpha, ... z for zebra format.

  I tried.  And tried. And tried some more.  And Netgear technical support was along for much of the ride.  I have such a basic setup with a Netgear 802.11G router.  And yet it was so flaky, even after a firmware update.  Never got it to work.  It seemed always like it was oh-so-close to working.  But it kept dropping my device mere minutes after connecting it (never mind the underlying internet connection wasn't working!).  Kept telling me the password was bad when it wasn't.  Or that I was setting up as Access Point (not Range Extender).  I don't know... I like Netgear but uy yuy yuy.Even if I ever got it to work, because I use access-control list on my router that would have created a new headache because the range extender creates this stand-in / pseudo / surrogate / replacement / proxy MAC address when connecting through it.  So any device that needed to use the extender (and we have a lot of devices!!) would need that alternative address entered in the router's access control list.  Big headache, that, so beware.  This may be a problem common to all devices of its ilk, not just Netgear's.I'm doing an RMA to Netgear under warranty, but I kind of think the replacement will behave no differently!

  I have Xfinity Xfi, so I’m pretty happy with my internet service. I can get upwards of 300Mbps download speeds (tested and verified). I purchased this extender to “extend” my already good service. This is rated to handle up to 750Mbps.1) the extension doesn’t match or really come close to even 75% of the speed of a direct connection to my router. Perhaps with an extension you lose some service with the relay, I can live with that. Let’s check the signal and see if it can reach some hard to find spots in the house. Not even close. The extended signal is weaker than my original signal from my base router. I did a simple speed test at “speedcheck.net” and there’s a Application for that.  I’m getting a better download speed off my base router than I am with the extender in the “dead” places in my house Grrr.2) There is a firmware update. Perhaps this has been addressed in the firmware update? (buzzer sound). NO. The firmware update actually killed the extender. It was a failed update where even the factory reset can’t save the extender.  The extender cannot power on properly to recognize a factory update. You can’t log into the extender from the web to re-do the firmware update. Now I’m required to do a manual push to the extender somehow using some MacGyver method of patching to it directly.I would recommend to stay away from this product. According to help forums this is a common problem and people who have this product can’t seem to fix it. I hope to find a better product.

The 2g band worked fine, but bandwidth is too low on that to really do anything (too slow to stream or even download pictures).  It would still connect to the actual 5g extender network but it did not have an internet connection.  Of course this all started happening after 4 months and the tech support is only 90 days.  I called amazon and they were very helpful and tried to help, they connected me to netgear and thats when they said I needed to spend $90 to extend the warranty and tech support to even continue talking to them over the phone.  I told them to go fly a kite, I only paid $30 for the piece of junk.  So now I'm stuck with a useless piece of junk that stopped working after 4 months.  Now have to go buy a better model.

  There are cheaper wifi range extenders but I wasn't in the mood for a lot of problems and anything to do with home wifi settings can give you enormous headaches. Really, really enormous headaches.So I went with Netgear because it's a popular brand which means if I ran into problems, I'd be able to find other users online with the same problems and maybe solutions.Obscure Chinese products are often very good, but you take your chances, and their manuals are almost always terrible.The extender arrived today and I followed the set-up instructions step by step and I had it up and running in 15-20 minutes without very much difficultly. The manual was good, but not great. There were some wrong turns I could have taken but I guess I was lucky. (Here's a tip. When you press the WPS button, don't freak out if it doesn't turn green right away. It takes a little bit of time.)If your router has a WPS button, you're in luck. It makes the set up a lot easier.I can't figure out if configuring it for ""Fastlane"" would be smart or not so I just left it function as ""Basic."" It works great, and I didn't want to foul things up. There are also unclear options on the website, but if you just let it be and keep it simple, everything will work.I don't understand why I get a faster signal using this extender, but I do, and that's a very nice added benefit.So, I played it safe and spent a little more money and bought the established brand because I didn't want any headaches. Performance is great. The set up was snag-free, that manual is fairly good. I wouldn't be surprised if this in the best in it's class in terms of performance and ease of set up.Could I have set up a cheaper unit just as fast with no aggravation? I'll never know. I just know that this is a good piece of equipment.

  I had the device for 5 months and the it suddenly stopped connecting to the internet. I went through all the trouble shooting, I reset the device and even tried to connect directly to the device through the IP address to check firmware updates. Nothing. It comes back and says the address is not responding.I called Netgear and there was a nice overseas tech support agent on the other line. All he asked me to do was plug it into a different outlet. WHAT!!! The free tech support is just plug it into another outlet. Since I was at 5 months of ownership, they wanted me to pay for their Gearhead service for a level one tech to go into the device remotely and reset stuff. You know, all the things I tried to already do and it wasn't responding to.My take on this is that if the device stops working, you get no help with the online troubleshooting (basically since none of the procedures they tell you about work or can be done), you start a case with them for the device. Call a service tech who only tells you that he can only have you try plugging it into another outlet. Then tells you that he cannot help you. You have to pay for there customer service help to fix something in a way that you already tried to do on your own but was not given access to by the faulty device.The entire process only made me think they just wanted your contact info to sell to other vendors. The whole process is insulting to customers and in my view predatory on naive individuals who either just need the thing to work or don't know much about the tech side. You know the same way Apple does with its Genius Bar help.When it worked it was ok, nothing special. But I will never buy one there items again. When buy something and only have it for a short time, you shouldn't have to pay for tech support. Especially for something as simple as a software reset on the device.

  To begin with, I do NOT generally write reviews for products. I had to change my thinking on this since (so far) this product WOWED me! I have had this wifi extender for less than 2 hours. I initially connected it using the WPS settings. I didn't like the way it was working so I reset it to factory settings and reinstalled with the web browser option. WOW! Super easy!! I moved the extender to my shop which is 300 feet (with lotsa big trees between)  from my house. I put it in an upstairs window and turned it on. DOWNSTAIRS, I checked the signal with my android phone. It connected to the 2.4Ghz signal @ 130Mbps and the 5.0Ghz @ 260Mbps. Incredible!  I'd bet that my laptop will also perform the same. The only thing that bothers me (w/the android phone) is that when it connects it says that  ""Internet may not be available"". It always has internet available been so I'll have to look into that issue. I may come back sometime in the future (if I remember) and update this review. So far I am very happy!  THANKS NETGEAR!UPDATE A FEW DAYS LATER:Well, it worked great for one day. The next day it wouldn't do anything so I power cycled it. It started working and did so for 1 more day. Another power cycle and 1 more day of usage. Today, it won't power cycle. The power light comes on.  Sometimes. But the unit won't do anything else. It's still within the Amazon Prime return window so back it goes. I can't decide whether to have it replaced with another (because when it worked it worked GREAT!) or try another brand.

  I am truly disappointed on Netgear Wi-Fi extender in many ways. It supposed to be an easy install but it didn't work so I called the tech support. They wanted to access to my computer to do the set up. Till this point everything was pleasant enough, once they checked my network they claimed that I have several hacks in my Wi-Fi from China and I have to clean them up and they offered a security protection program for $ 100 to $ 250 up to 3 years. I told them I would like to talk to my Wi-Fi provider and they should finish the installation of the Wi-Fi extender and they claimed that it will not work. I contacted AT&T Internet support they checked the system and they couldn't find any evidence of hacking. I have the latest fiber router recently installed. AT&T technician also mentioned there is no way such hack would be in my Wi-Fi network. Afterwards I installed the extender myself and found out the extender is actually working worse than my AT&T router. Where I get over 100 Mbps directly from the router the extender barely made 35 Mbps. So it is on its way back to Netgear, I am very disappointed on Netgear they used to be success story, now they look like they are trying to take advantage of people. On another note if your Wi-Fi hacked it would only be serving others to get online and it has nothing to do with your Wi-Fi extender. Shame on you Netgear!.

  Easy to set up and have had no problems with it except one. When I installed it the WiFi signal was strong through out my home. But I did notice last night the WiFi signal was ""fluctuating"" where normally it was steady. But I had no problem with the internet as far as speed. Also,I didn't realize until I bought and installed it that you have to create ""another WiFi"" for each original WiFi you have installed. We have a regular WiFi and a 5g. So we had to double the WiFi sources in the house. So now we have WiFi ""extended"" and 5g ""extended"" along with our original WiFi. Not a big deal, but you do have to swap to different WiFi sources on your device depending on your signal and where you are located. Still, I would recommend this NETGEAR Extender for the price and performance..

  We have a cable modem with a 2.4-5.0 GHz NetGear router downstairs.  Over the years as we've seen more and more networks show up on ""available networks"" as our neighbors have got on line, we've seen a definite decrease in our ability to connect upstairs (coincidence-I don't know).  Regardless we decided to try this extender before looking for other solutions such as a new router.  The first extender we received was dead on arrival - plugged it in/no power.In a chat session with Amazon and after describing the problem, Amazon immediately sent us a new one plus a no cost return label for the bad one.  No requirement that I send the bad one back first.  Great service and I'm glad I had the chat session because it probably saved some time.The new unit works just fine so far.  I did the setup as listed in the Quick Start brochure that came with it using my browser instead of WPS.  The default names (SSID) for the extender on each band was slightly different so I used them.  It offered a choice of security options and I chose WPA2 which is what I use on my primary router.  One confusion I had was that while the initial extender setup page asked for a unique password, later, when I had to positively  select if I wanted it for just one or both bands, that required using the password for my primary router.  That part of the setup instructions wasn't completely clear.  I suggest reviewing other reviews that discuss setup before setting this up.  Based on initial performance I'd give it 5 stars, but the less than completely clear instructions dropped it to 4.So far after placing the extender upstairs, our connection there has gone from either zero to one bar to three bars.  If this continues, it's worth every penny.

  Works as intended.  Wireless router in the front office of the house, put this unit in the kitchen halfway in the middle of the house, and now we can stream Netflix or Hulu In the back bedroom, complete opposite end of the house from the router.  Took me all of 7 minutes to get this set up.  Start in the same room as the router, plug it in, once power light goes green push WPS, then WPS on the router.  Once they link up and the signal light goes green, connect a device to the wireless signal.  Then you can unplug and put it in the final location halfway to the area you are trying to boost.

  This product is terrible.  Don't waste your money. I spent an hour on the phone with customer service to set it up for my mom at her house because they website they gave wasn't coming up on her computer which was a red flag to me right off the bat.  Teh customer service rep finally helps me get it all set up.  It worked when I left. 3 months later I visit and notice it's not working.  When we put in the password to connect and it says unable to join network. I've done everything it says to do in the instructions, it stays it's connected, and it still doesn't work.  I've confirmed the password via the account we set up and still nothing.  I tried to contact customer service and they said you can't speak to someone in customer service because it's been 90 since the purchase. So there's basically nothing that we can do.  And now I can't return it. We even still have the box because I didn't trust it. How convenient for them to put such a strict timeline on a terrible product. Terrible product and terrible customer service. I'm an honest person.  Don't buy it. Thanks Amazon as well for condoning a terrible that I can't return.

  I have Frontier FIOS WiFi 500/500. Well, sort of. In my area, there was a tremendous response to a promotional offer, and as more and more piled on, the speed has suffered and is way, way below that. But my older Verizon WiFi extender that supported FIOS 100/100 wasn't compatible with this, so the hunt was on for a WiFi extender.I began with the Frontier extender and discovered that it ran hot enough to cause a fire potentially, so off it went.I trust the Netgear name, and this one can support higher than 500/500 and is so well-priced, and it arrived nicely packed, instructions that are clear but kind of not that clear for me, totally a non-techie.It works. And once you discover how to make it work, it's so easy and yay, success.1. Press the WPS button on the side of the extender which you must plug into an outlet really close to your router. It will blink, cute.2. Within 2 minutes, press the WPS button on your router. So far, the instructions are really clear, the ones in the booklet that accompanies this.3. I didn't need to repeat step 3 in the booklet, it is smart enough to handle this all on its own, the 5GHz (why is the little z always little, strange, right).4. In a minute or maybe even instantly, the extender names will show up on your wifi network, like NETGEAR_EXT (and some other netgear names that you can ignore as I did, for a bit, no idea why a few showed up, oh well)5. Type in mywifiext.net next, and it's a popup box thing. Complete the questions, which will ask after your name and password and secret questions are created for Next, then you'll see maybe 2 sources, the usual and the 5G, each (well, mine does) has different user names and passwords. Toss those in, click away and it takes maybe 2 minutes to process, and it may even say you're transmitting on an insecure (poor thing) network. And voila, then you will have done it.You can then unplug the extender, and don't drop it as you proudly cart it off to the area you want it (me, in the living room, close to my outdoor courtyard where I hadn't had any wifi). Plug it in, resist your moments of disappointment as it will likely show up with an amber light, not the green yet. It took mine almost two minutes to go green.I did it, you can do it so much more easily and with confidence. Yay.

  This is a great range extender hardware wise, it has 3 modes, lets you extend your wifi to wifi, wifi to ethernet port, or as an access point(ethernet port to wifi). The range is good and I like the simple wall plug format. The biggest drawback is you can't use this without registering your email address and registering 2 extreme sensitive personal questions such as my mother's maiden name, what city my mother/father was born, best friend's name, etc... Why do I need to give such sensitive information just to use a wifi range extender???

  I do not use a lot of extreme-data apps, so I can generally use my smartphone data without going over. But I also have a WiFi - only tablet, and needed a better signal in the back yard about 30 feet from the  house. I have a cheapo Western Digital dual band router, which is on the 2nd floor at the farthest point (about 100 feet) from my shady lawn spot. The signal is fine inside, but the outside signal strength from the router was fair to poor, with frequent YouTube freeze-ups.I installed this extender in the walkout basement, about 50 feet from my outside spot. Signal strength is now good to strong. I just watched a 15 minute video with no freeze ups at all!I flirted with the idea of buying a better router ($200+) instead, but decided to try this extender first. For someone in my shoes, I'd recommend this extender. I'm sure this extender is not screaming fast, and I do not know how well it would handle multiple devices. I also was not able to get the 5 GHZ band set up on it, but that might be a router issue. 2.4 band works well enough for my needs on the tablet.

  This is a life saver for me. I needed a solid connection for work, and Im only allowed to use wired. Problem was, I live out in the country. I used this to repeat my hotspot signal, because the only option is satellite. And it is horrible. The upload and download speeds are great, and the ping is much better than the satellite. And all of this is just off of a hotspot. There is no delay. I forget it is coming from a hotspot sometimes. I recommend this repeater for anyone who needs a wired connection from a wifi signal or you need to extend the range. It is a huge help.

",3.0 ,TZCPA,"Reviewed in the United States August 10, 2019","









  
  
    
  Pros - the price, not TOO ugly, it works ""kinda""Cons - quirky setup - seems like most folks can't get Internet to work on both 2.4GHz and 5GHz and I had (and have) the same problem.  5GHz kept self-selecting the dreaded 169 IP address.  Finally in my umpteenth setup, I chose to NOT select a 2.4GHz frequency - in fact, mine that it had already found ""one-minus-umpteenth"" time was not even listed.  Finally, 5GHz worked...and so did 2.4GHz!  Back to 5GHz and it worked!  Back to 2.4GHz...and the dreaded 169 IP had relocated to the lower frequency.  Okay.  I can deal with it.  Back to 5GHz and working.  Whew.  Let's try 2.4GHz again...and the dang thing worked again.  QUIRKY!!!  I guess it MAY have something to do with a 2018 firmware update and maybe there's a new one.  But, it you can mess with it and reboot your router occasionally (installing a smart surge protect required it 2 weeks ago and installing Ooma last week did, too), you'll probably be happy enough with this.  If not, call your electricity and Internet providers and cancel your service.  This is the NEW WORLD.  Live with it.  3 stars for now...higher later if it doesn't crap out and lower later if it does and I return it.

  So I spent about 1hour getting a CISCO RE1000 setup to my apple airport express and I just could not get them connected, and it took about 5 minutes on each try and then I would have to reset and wait for it to come back up etc..... I got so frustrated that I bought this AC750 which luckily was prime 1day, nice, and with some reservations on how long it would take to setup I began.  I simply plugged the AC750 into an outlet, connected to the SSID and then I was in.  Then from the easy to use user friendly utility that launched, I simply logged into my existing router and I was up and running.... it could not have been any easier.  My nest cam has been connected for about 24 hours without dropping so I am pleased.  Great price and easy setup.

  I got this to extend our wifi out to the driveway where our camper is parked. Between the main wifi router and the camper is only 70ft or so, but we have a brick house and part of the concrete structure garage in the way, so signal out there is weak if we get one at all. I tried this thing everywhere in between, even outside in an outdoor outlet, and every location I either got an amber device light saying the device was too far away, or the amber router light saying the router was too far away. The 2.4 had less trouble as it's the further reaching band but I was still only getting 1-2 bars out in the camper on my phone and 0-1 bar on the Xbox. Not enough to watch Netflix, barely enough to watch YouTube. 5ghz band never connected with either device, wouldn't even show up on the Xbox. All this to say that with my main wifi router, the Xbox reads 2 bars at 2.4 and 1 bar at 5, with interference dropouts being the main issue, so this extender is effectively worse than my main router even at half the distance. Netgear is usually a good brand, we've only ever had Netgear routers with great results. But this definitely falls short. Will be returning for a broader range extender.

  I bought this to extend wifi reception to the other end of the house 40 feet from our router. I first tried placing the extender in the next room 30 feet from the router, but I could not get a signal. We had been getting some signal to our iPads in that room but this extender could not connect. So I placed the extender in a direct line of sight 20 feet from the router. Then I was able to get a connection. It seemed to work for a few weeks, but now it is getting poor to none connection to the router. I get a better signal at the other end of the house without the extender. Conclusion: this is a needless piece of garbage. Don't waste your money on it.I also tried to update the firmware and the NetGear website doesn't have a way to access the update unless you have registered your email and password, and there is no way to correct password verification problems. So if there is a typo in your name or password you are basically locked out of any tech support.

  Follow the instructions and this isn't difficult to set up. Downside is that it creates 2 new networks (2.4 and 5 ghz) that you need to have your devices memorize. I've had extenders, including Netgears, that didn't do that. A nice point is that, if you want to run a physical Ethernet cable, this can be an access point rather than an extender. I'll probably do that soon.It's inexpensive enough that I'm comfortable using it outside, well under cover, to provide coverage for my yard. So far, so good.

  I live in an old house with a lot of brick and plaster.  As you know, these things are Kryptonite for Wifi signals.  We have one absolute deadspot in the front of the house that's the furthest away from our router's signal.  This extender works perfectly to provide coverage in that area.  Keep in mind that your Internet speeds won't be as fast when connected to the extender as they would be directly connecting to the router.  However, I can still get Internet speeds of 250Mbps download and 15 Mbps upload when using it.  So it's not a problem at all!  These are definitely fast enough.  No complaints there.  Just something to keep in mind if you've got a super slow and archaic rural Internet connection.I'd love for the antennaes to be a little bit longer, but it's fine.  Our home's only deadspot is completely covered in signal now.  If I really absolutely needed longer antennaes I would have bought the more expensive Netgear extenders.

  Installed this to extend wifi coverage on the second floor of my home. I am not very knowledgeable of home networking, but I was able to set this up quite easily which is a huge plus for me.Placement is very important, you need to ensure that this extender is still within range and receiving a strong signal from your existing wifi network/router.  It will not boost or increase the speed, it will only pass through what it is able to receive. If you place this in an area where it receives a weak signal, it will simply extend or repeat the weak signal. I used a wifi speed app on my phone to identify the dead zones in the house as well as places where the signal was still strong enough to connect the extender.You need to connect your devices to either the range extender or your wifi router. If you move from one area of the house to another, you will have to change the network on your device to connect to the strongest signal.While this worked to extend coverage effectively, I ultimately purchased a whole house wifi system with mesh technology. It's much more robust than the extender. This ensures full wifi coverage throughout the home and devices automatically switch between the access points to ensure the best speed while you move about the house.

  I have a background in IT Networking and haven't used a WiFi extender in years so I figured I'd give this a shot. Bad decision.1.) This is not so much as a WiFi extender, but a repeater. It uses the EXACT SAME CHANNEL as the main WiFi router. This means it INTERFERES with your original signal. For any access point, you should always use a different channel so you don't get interference. Not possible.2.) In an area with poor signal from my standard issue FiOS router (about 15mbps on a 200mbps connection), I thought this would really help out. I plugged the device in half way between the two areas. Keep in mind, half way is literally 20 feet away with no walls. I connect to this device, and the speed is 10mpbs. That's right, it's SLOWER than not using it at all.3.) I figured I would put this in access point mode as a last ditch effort. Plugged into the router and broadcasting it's own wifi signal. Standing next to the router and the device: Main WiFi signal from Router--200mbps, Speed from this device (which is hardwired to the router)--13mbps.4.) This device literally does not work. Don't waste your money or be enticed by a $5 off for Prime Members coupon.

  Bought this extender on a whim based on a spotty wi-fi strength in my house.  The house is concrete block with a metal roof and a lot of rebar which seems to attenuate the signal strength.  I was having difficulty getting adequate signal to a remote video camera which was only about 35 feet from the wi-fi hub.  Signal strengh at the device was -78dB where -50 is considered an adequate signal.Installation and set-up was quite easy for both 2.4 and 5 gig, and the unit was set up about 10 feet from the security camera.  All signal lights on the unit are in the green.  The signal health on the camera improved to -63dB which makes it usable, but not optimal.  The camera is the only device on this sub-network.  Saw some improvement but was hoping for a lot more,realizing that this is low-priced model.  Conversely, it is also NOT a complete failure, either.

  Does what it's supposed to do. It took a bit of fiddling around as the instructions didn't work as stated. Once you type in the address it was supposed to walk you through a wizard but it never popped up. I went to my wifi connections and clicked on it there. Ran through the steps and nothing happened. It took about 6-8 minutes to finally kick in after that for the light to turn green.

  I've switched to streaming TV service and was looking to extend my wife service to my lanai and BR on far side of the house from where my modem/router is located. Set up was very simple using the WPS in the same room then located the repeater to the middle of the house.  Now my lanai and master BR get 5 bars of signal instead of 3.  Portable devices that move from room to room don't automatically switch like a mesh system does but that doesn't seem to be a problem for my 1500 square foot home. This was a very cost effective way for me to get better signal to my Roku devices around the house so I am quite happy.  Can't quite give 5 stars but would do 4.5 if the option was there.  May be moving to a larger home in another state where I would consider a mesh system but for my current need this simple device does what I need.  Only been using for several months so will see if it holds up over time but so far so good.

  I have purchased 2 of these over the last year to enhance WiFi coverage.  The product seems to function well although I have noticed the signal is not as strong when there are a few walls between this device and the router.  Suspect the advertised range assumes absolutely nothing is hindering the signal which is probably not a very common installation.

  Not much to like.

I am fairly computer literate, but I couldn't ""fix"" the issue and after much fiddling I gave up. The fact that two devices were attempting to use the same IP address rendered the extender useless on the two laptops. There was noyhing in the instructions on how to fix the issue. I did notice that in the settings it said configure the IP address automatically, so I am assuming there is a major issue in the extender's sofware.

    Nightmare to set up and impossible to decipher instruction manual
  
",1.0 ,DEdwards,"Reviewed in the United States March 28, 2018","









  
  
    
  No stars.  Returned it.  Massive PIA to try to decipher the tech argot of the directions and it didn't work anyway.  I bought it to extend the range of my router's wifi signal for an outdoor camera.  Even after all the irritation involved with getting it paired to the house wifi and then plugging the extender into an outlet closer to the camera, it had zero impact on the camera's signal.  The location receives a strong 4-bar signal from the router, too.  There's no phone number to call for help with the setup unless you register the product first.  The website you have to go to for the setup process doesn't even bother to tell you up front, where it might be helpful, that you won't ever see the setup assistant until you access Netgear's web pages through the extender's wifi, not your home router's wifi.  The website has links for setting up with a PC or Mac, but the one for Macs doesn't work--the page never loads.  Well, not until you've accidentally come across that information, on a completely different page that you found while looking for set-up help, that you have to access NetGear's pages through the extender's wifi signal, not the wifi from your own router.If you finally get to the setup assistant you will be asked questions you have no clue how to answer because they're all in tech-speak.  Why is it necessary to call a password a ""network key""?  Why don't you just say ""password""?  ""Make sure your computer is set up to use DHCP"".  Really.  I'll get right on that.  I've been using personal computers for 30 years and have never seen the term ""DHCP"" and have no idea how to check that my computer is set up to use it, but since you bring it up, why don't you tell me how to ""make sure"" of that?  Worthless.  The whole instruction guide is like that and the setup assistant is worse by far.  And hey, did you know that ""WPS does not support WEP network security""?  Who cares, if you don't know what either of those things are and if they don't tell you how to determine which your wifi has?  The manual will tell you things like, ""Click the Next button and the status screen displays"".  Wrong.  Like a lot of the other steps.  You know what happens when you click Next?  The setup assistant completely vanishes and you end up back on NetGear's main web page.  You are not offered something logical for the next step in the process, like a log-in setup option, or a flashing neon sign that says ""setup complete"" or any information on the status of the device you think you maybe might have possibly just set up.  Nothing.  Here's our web page.  Enjoy this total lack of feedback about what you were just trying to accomplish and whether it worked or not.No idea whether their phone tech support is any good or not because I put the device back in the box and printed a return label, but phone support is good for only 90 days anyway.  Besides, you have to register the product first--so they can have your personal information and probably put you on 20,000 mailing lists for spam--before they'll give you access to the super-duper-secret-classified help line number.  Never trust a company that won't give you free phone setup help in its instruction manual.

  So initially I set this up using the same SSID, imagining my device to seamlessly connect to the one with the stronger signal. I had imagined wrong, as it's not a mesh network, and I really shouldn't have. Honestly learned my lesson that way, but only really wanted to extend my network range around a fridge blocking signals at the dining table. Speed testing has a steady good speed, but occasionally there'd be some random drops. Again not an issue, as I'm not really gaming, just circumventing a blind spot. For that, this was enoughAnd yet the main reason for my 3 Stars was that even with a different SSID, connecting to it was a pain, and I don't mean switching networks, I mean every time I try, it takes its d*mn time to connect to it. 10-20 seconds, always stuck at the ""acquiring IP"" step, like there's not a network it's attached to. And before I'm opening up a webpage, or an app page, 1-2 minutes have passed. Tried putting it in a different outlet, an empty one at that, hoping to circumvent any power cables that might be interfering, but nothing, same issue applies throughout.

  It might have just been my modem/settings but I was unable to activate it easily by using the wps button. It would say my password was incorrect even when I know it wasn't. I was able to set it up by connecting my phone to it ( plan b on the instructions) and typing in the ""website"" into my browser. This worked before I updated the firmware and then I reset the extender and when I tried to set it up again, typing in the website wouldn't work. It just wouldn't do anything. So I had to edit the settings from my wifi network list on my phone and click manage router after I was connected. ALSO I will point this out in case anybody got this for the same purpose as me....my work given computer only works with an ethernet cable but I didn't want to be stuck sitting at my kitchen counter forever and I definitely didn't want to buy a 100ft ethernet cable and run it across my house just to move my computer to a different room. I bought this so I can plug it in anywhere and use it's ethernet port to connect to my work computer. Well because of certain settings on my work computer, it will not connect to this extender. The message I get is something about the dhcp. This problem I ONLY had on my work computer I know it has to do with the computers settings that I can't change. Ethernet port works just fine on my person computer.

    UPDATE - Worthless documentation and help on MAC address filtering, but I finally got it to work.
  
",3.0 ,Steve T.,"Reviewed in the United States May 5, 2019","









  
  
    
  Most Recent Update: While searching to find a better WiFi extender I discovered the reviews and documentation on many other moderately priced extenders either didn't mention MAC address filtering, had many user complaints that this feature didn't work, or alluded to similar ""virtual MAC addresses.""  I experimented a little more with this repeater and discovered their new ""virtual addresses"" were really the actual hardware addresses of the connected device (an address which I had already entered into the Router table) but with the first three hexidecimal pairs replaced with ""o2:0f:b5.""  Thus, a device with a real MAC address of ""1a:2b:3c:4d:5e:6f"" would be forwarded to the router as ""o2:of:b5:4d:5e:6f:""  Why do they do this?  The real address is already in the router table.  They're forcing me to add a second address for every device that might connect to the repeater with this ""pig Latin"" version of a MAC address.  But, at least I now know how to configure the table, and making altered duplicates of the existing entries was easier than their suggested method of turning off MAC filtering, running around the house to every device which might work better using the repeater and connecting it to the repeater, trying to discover new MAC addresses on a dynamically updating ""connected device"" list, writing down these new MAC addresses, turning MAC filtering back on to expose the MAC address tables, and typing the newly discovered virtual addresses into the table.  I still don't understand why they screw around with the MAC addresses instead of just using the real address, or why they don't document how their ""virtual MAC addresses"" are formed, but now that I know their secret I got it to work so I'm keeping the repeater.--------------------------------------------------New Problems:  Turns out the mysterious ""Android"" address I had to add to get the extender to work only fixed the problem for my phone.  In addition to the five MAC addresses for the extender, every device that connects to the extender generates a new ""virtual MAC address"" that has to be added to the router table.  For mobile devices, which might sometimes connect to the main router and sometimes connect to the extender, this means entering two MAC addresses in the router table - the actual hardware address which I already have and a new ""virtual"" address which I can only discover by turning off MAC filtering and looking for a new, undocumented device.  I'm sending this repeater back and getting one from a competitor.-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------I rated this a ""3"" overall because once I finally got it configured it seems to work pretty well, and if you don't want to limit access based upon MAC addresses it's pretty easy to set up.  Configuring it for MAC filtering, however, was a nightmare.  That feature is mostly undocumented, what documentation does exist is misleading, and although their Tech Support was friendly and tried to be helpful, they didn't know much about MAC filtering.  I'm not an IT expert, but I've configured several home WiFi routers and repeaters in the past with no problem.  MAC filtering was a pain because I had to find the MAC address of every device I wanted to connect and type that address into a table in the router and also type these addresses into a table in the repeater, but it worked.  It took me maybe 10 minutes to get this range extender working without MAC filtering.  I spent probably 6 or 7 hours getting it to work with MAC filtering, including probably 4 hours working with Netgear's Tech Support staff.My first challenge was finding the MAC address of the extender.  There was no documentation on how to find this address.  The documentation simply said ""connect everything you have to the extender and then copy all the MAC address that show up on your router into the MAC table.  No can do.  Not all the devices I have are within range of the extender - most connect directly to the router - and several devices that I need to connect to the extender belong to children who weren't home at the moment.  Also, some weird devices (neighbors?) show up in the connection table whenever I turn off MAC filtering, so I don't want to add any ""unknown"" devices to the MAC authorization and give them unlimited access to my network.  So, I connected some devices and looked at the list of connected devices, which changed dynamically as lightly tasked devices periodically touched base.  Nothing that looked remotely like a Netgear repeater showed up.On most devices you need to dig down into a ""Settings"" menu to find the MAC address.  No such luck with this extender.  I also couldn't find any reference to it in the documentation or in the installation wizard, so I contacted Tech Support.  They said it was printed on the label on the back of the device.  I had looked at the label and successfully found a number which I correctly guessed to be the serial number (needed to contact Tech Support) by using a bright light and reading glasses.  There were other numbers, unlabeled, which I assumed were specific model numbers, lot numbers, etc.  By using a bright light, reading glasses, and a powerful magnifying glass I now saw that one had the word ""MAC"" written in even tinier letters, placed vertically, beside it.  Configuring this device is not for the visually challenged, or for anyone with less than perfect eyesight.  I hadn't recognized this as the MAC address because, contrary to common practice and to what the Netgear start-up guide said, it wasn't configured like a MAC address.  I would have instantly recognized ""F7:42:3B: . . ."" as a hexidecimal MAC address.  The label presented it as ""F7423B. . ."" which looks remarkably like a serial number or lot number.  The Tech Support person also said I'd have to reset to factory defaults after I entered the MAC address into my router.I entered the hardware MAC address, reset to factory defaults, and reconfigured the repeater from scratch.  Several times.  Still no luck.  Then, in what looked like a footnote to one of the error messages I received, I noticed wording that said ""Make certain you enter these MAC addresses in your router.""  They provided four MAC addresses which were formatted as MAC addresses, but strung together so it was tough to see where one ended and the other began.  During one of the many periods I spent searching online for tips on configuring this extender I had read that Netgear used something called ""virtual MAC addresses"" instead of a hardware address, so I replaced the hardware address with these four.  Still no luck.The next call to Tech Support took several hours.  She had me reset to factory default several times, enter the hardware MAC address in addition to the four virtual MAC addresses, and change several settings on my router.  Still no luck.  The extender would connect to the router and devices would connect to the extender, but the extender refused to provide them with IP addresses.  The Tech Support person finally declared that it must be a router problem and said I needed to call the router manufacturer's Tech Support.More searching on the Internet.  Now that I had the problem narrowed down to ""Netgear extender connects to devices but won't provide IP addresses"" I found an entry in the Netgear knowledge base (why couldn't Tech Support find that?) which said ""Turn off MAC filtering and look at the connect table for any devices with MAC addresses that begin with these three character pairs.""  I did that, and after watching the table go through a few refresh cycles I spotted something labeled ""Android"" with the correct MAC prefix.  I added that to my MAC table (the 6'th MAC address for a single repeater) and everything started working.  So in the end, my repeater works, but I feel I'm being generous in giving a ""3"" rating to a product that does not provide you with the required MAC addresses in its documentation, its installation software, or through its Tech Support representatives.

Instructions were clear on where to set it up and I wish I had purchased this years ago. Using download / upload speed apps, my speed doubled. In theory this doesn't make sense because the router has to output the higher signal, but i only assume a setting or not resetting often enough created a sort of clog.Connecting devices to both networks (original ssid and ssid1) the extender wifi signal was stronger and faster. Even though it's an upstairs bedroom, i still get a better signal if I'm in the basement. I would recommend this product very highly.

  This device got me exactly what I wanted, a stronger, reliable signal in my upstairs bedroom.Surprisingly, the Quick Start guide failed to mention that it is a good idea to hook the device to your router with an ethernet cable while connecting to the web browser based set up. Step one suggests that you connect using a network manager on your computer or wifi device. Doing this will likely make it unnecessary to use an ethernet cable.  If you don't do this, you can easily connect by using an ethernet cable from your router to the Range Extender. The Quick Start manual doesn't mention the ethernet cable option, just the wifi connect option. Once connected and set up, you can and should disconnect the ethernet cable. I didn't use any of the help features such as chat or phone calls, but they seem to be readily available if needed.There were a few glitches and tense moments at first but the device is now stable and working as expected.

  I hate this thing. Right now I'm stuck with it, but will be buying a different one when I can. Think you're playing it safe by getting a recognizable brand like Netgear? Think again.It drops constantly, resetting it usually fixes the problem, but the fix is always brief and it always inevitably drops again. Usually within 20-30 minutes, sometimes it will drop in as little as one minute, and sometimes an hour if you're really lucky. But one thing is guaranteed, and that is that it will always drop soon, it has never not dropped, it is like a law of nature that this thing will eventually drop connection for seemingly no reason at all with no warning, no slowdown, just one second it works, next second it does not. And it seems to be getting worse and I have had it for less than a year. It is rage inducing. If you like being ripped off and making constant trips to turn something off and on again go ahead and buy this piece of junk.

  Terrible app. Great idea for the price. Wants you to just plug and play. It isn't that easy. The app has 3 stars, and it wants you to login to your router using only ""admin"". I get having to login to the router using the modem/router IP but...security? Who owns this app? There is virtually no tech support. It may work for other Netgear devices but, these things promise miracles and I just realized it's all fantasy. Just spend the extra 70$ and get a new modem/router? Fixed. If you have another name for your router it won't let you login. I reset my router 4 times and tried to login using the app (using different passwords for my router). No work. Sucks. Plugged in nice though.

  The first months (during the return window) this worked like a charme, it extended my WiFi network from the second floor to the first with no issues, the second month I noticed a lost of range from green light to orange all the time. So I moved it closer to the router. About 15 days later same issue so I had to move it even closer (and no the problem was not the router itself). WhereI mover it has been working but then it doesn’t extend the WiFi as far as I want it but at least the green light has been persistent. 3rd month of use and my smart switches give me about 4-5 “offline” alerts a day. Only the ones connected to this extender. I have to restart the extender every time. If I don’t restart it devices can’t connect to it because “incorrect password” but obviously the password has not changed, after restarting the device the password “magically” works again. So for a life span of 1-3months you are better off buying another one spend a little bit more money and get yourself something that will work more than 3 months.

  I was looking for an extender to hook my security cameras and work place. Instead of rewiring, I was able to use this to extend WiFi coverage to the corners and also connect them to security cameras.Setup: Easy to setup. Either as Extender or access point. Creates 2 wireless networks (2.4GHz and 5GHz), allows you to configure which WiFi frequency to use for the Ethernet port., Disable/enable Access point names.UI: Web access is pretty much what I use. I can monitor connected devices, ability to change settings of the wireless network, access control, and setup/modify the settings.Other: Has couple of buttons on the device, which allows us to turn-on/off the device, reset the network / settings.Usage: I use both WiFi network and a single ethernet port on the device. Both are pretty usable.Overall: pretty happy with the device and gives a good speed to my devices.

We have good signal to our devices in the living room, but where we first tried the extender in the living room it didn't get signal. We found another spot where it did get signal (most of the time), about 40 feet from the router, with no walls in the way. And usually it supplies our dead room well, but not always.

  I had high hopes for this product but ultimately they fell short. This may be bumped up to a 4 star review in some peoples eyes. The issue I had with this device was not that it did not boost my wifi at the selected location. It worked well in that area, which is why it might be 4 stars for some. The issue I ran into was that it had an effect on the wifi at other locations in my house. For example, in my room, the wifi used to be great but when I was on the original wifi ( not the extended wifi) it was significantly slower and many times my devices would not automatically connect to the wifi.

  I've had no issues with the NETGEAR Wifi Range Extender EX3700 once I successfully installed it.  Details of my experience:- I was pleasantly surprised that several of my streaming devices actually received better speeds when connected to the Extender even though the devices were closer in distance to my base hub.- For those times when I've lost my internet connection the Extender has automatically reconnected to the cable modem once the internet connection was re-established.  BTW,  I'm using a cable modem/WIFI all-in-one combo provided by Comast- Having both 5G & 2G is handy since several of my Smart bulbs only work with 2G and won't configure to a 5G network- Initial Installation:  In my case I wasn't able to perform the initial Extender configuration to my cable modem wirelessly so I finally resorted to connecting the Extender directly to a cable modem port via ethernet cable.  Once the installation and configuration was complete I disconnected the ethernet cable and moved the Extender to the desired wall socket where it has worked flawlessly as a wireless extender since.

  If you have an AC Wifi Router with the 5Gz band the extender is fast enough to work with a Tivo Mini.

This one has the speed to handle all the functions of the hard wired Tivo and a simultaneous wireless connection.  It also does NOT shut itself off to save energy (as some of the powerline extenders do) so the Tivo Mini doesn't lose its connection.The extender is 31 feet from my main router (Linksys AC1200) and on the other side of a kitchen wall with kitchen cabinets, a range, and a microwave in between.

    Mostly good, with a few caveats
  
",3.0 ,Koala Balla,"Reviewed in the United States November 20, 2016","









  
  
    
  I'm a developer, and I end up working from home a lot. I'm often in virtual meetings, on calls, sharing screen, or simply uploading content to a cloud network or github. With that, I need a stable connection. My office, of all places, has severe interference and almost all WIFI signals in the house drop in and out, constantly. I never had a stable connection. So, I decided that, since I have decent Netgear Nighthawk router, I'd get a Netgear WIFI Range extender. This has essentially solved my connection dropouts completely - but with a few caveats. Below are the pros and cons I have found - some of which may be deal breakers for you.Pros:1. Easy to install - the instructions are a bit vague, but if you can follow the first step - which is plugging it in, then connecting to the default SSID on your laptop - you can then follow the instructions on the wizard that pops up on your screen after doing so.2. Small - seems obvious, but this does make for a nice discrete extender. My router is quite bulky, and I don't have a ton of space to store more devices, so I really like how small this thing is.3. Mostly stable - even in my ""dead"" office that blocks most wifi signals, I was able to find a good middle-ground spot that allows me to get reasonable signal.CONS:1. Huge speed decrease as you move further away. This may sound obvious, but this is actually pretty significant. It has great range, but you have to be within 6 feet to get similar speeds you may already get being 20 feet away from your router. For example, my router is on the first floor of our home, and my bedroom is right above it. My extender literally is just outside my room. Standing within 2-5 feet of the extender, my laptop gets a decent 150+/- mbps. Standing 10 feet away from it, or in my bedroom, it drops all the way down to 15Mbps, whereas the router, which is on another floor, maintains the 150mbps.2. The connection is stable, but the speed is not. Running multiple speed tests shows my download speed drop substantially momentarily before rising back up again. It never completely disconnects, but will loose 75% of the speed for a few seconds. If you're like me, and you only needed this for work and day-to-day tasks, you probably won't notice the drop. But if you're a gamer who plays, say, first-person shooters online, you may encounter lag and skipped frames. Or, if you're watching movies, you may lose some quality in the image.3. The instruction booklet is not very useful past the first couple pages. The information is somewhat inconsistent with what actually needs to be done.Conclusion:If you're like me and you simply need a basic, stable, wireless connection, this will do the trick. However, if you're hoping to maintain your download speeds, you may need to look elsewhere. You may be better off buying an AC adapter (that converts wall power into a somwhat direct ethernet/Cat5 connection between your device and router), and either plugging your computer directly into that, OR plugging in an additional router or hotspot to that. It'd be a bit more expensive, but would work. This is definitely not for gamers or for streaming high-definition movies.I have to say, for what I needed it for, it's perfect. I am somewhat disappointed, though, in the speed/distance performance impact. For this price-point ($40), I'd expect better.

Install was a breeze.  I conducted numerous speed tests and it cuts the speed basically in half, on average, but still works just fine... for me.  This is only on my non-Apple devices (LG V20 phone, desktop PC with WiFI, and a relatively new Lenovo laptop).  My wife's Apple products (iPhone 9S and iPad Air) have serious issues connecting to the WiFi, but especially through the extender.  I am not sure I blame the extender, but we're going to try another (more expensive/faster speed rated) one to see if that helps.  For the price, it gets the job done for me, a non-fruit user, but not for Apple products.

  I don't normally review things, but this extender works so incredibly well!

It wasn't. Even though I was getting 60mbps when I was wired directly to the modem, I was only getting 30mbps standing RIGHT NEXT to it on wifi. It made streaming on netflix annoying at times because of how terrible the wifi was. Enter the Netgear AC750. I don't know why people had a hard time setting this up. It's very easy if you follow the instructions. I set it up as an extender, not as a access point, but still...It took me about 10 minutes. One very cool feature about this device is that it broadcasts simultaneously in 2.4 and 5 ghz. This lets you choose which network to use if you have older devices that don't  support 5ghz. My router only broadcasts in EITHER 2.4 or 5ghz. Somehow, the Netgear is able to still broadcast in 5ghz even though my router is set to 2.4. Not sure how this works, but it's a good thing. Bottom line, This thing solved all my network problems. I was afraid I was going to have to move my router to a more central location which would have required me to get under the house and run wires. This saved me time and money. If I could give it more stars I would...

  I got this for my son who is renting a house in a dense urban area for college. When I searched networks with my phone, I’ve never seen so much traffic. Coverage throughout the house was impossible and the students need it. Plugged it into a power outlet, and pushed the WPS button on router and extender (per instructions). When the lights stopped flashing, unplugged and moved upstairs to a new power outlet and now full coverage throughout the whole house for everyone. Easy. No configuration or computer necessary. Been 2 months of heavy use with no trouble, but my son has had to unplug and plug back in a couple of times. Maybe the hurricane that hit him had something to do with it?!?  Very good, inexpensive device just works, especially in high traffic environments.

  I would have rated this product a 1 star however, it does work as designed.  The BIG SECRET is that although it does extend your wireless signal quite well, it CUTS YOUR INTERNET SPEED IN HALF. So if you are getting 100Mbps from your router directly, you would get roughly 50Mbps when connecting to this device. And yes, it does say this somewhere in the paperwork, but should be more appropriately disclosed up front. Device description says it is capable of speeds up to 750 Mbps, which is probably true, but VERY MISLEADING.

  It is not as easy to install as they say. It has to be synced to the router before you can use it to extend the Wi-Fi range to be picked up in other areas. If you have computers and printers on a network in various areas in a house, they will receive the Wi-Fi signal fine. TVs with ROKU and streaming and other electronics will not receive it as well and so a range extender is the answer. You may have to call for tech support. I didn't have to because my son helped me and he is well-versed in electronics, networks, etc.

This Wifi extender did not improve the signal in the room that I was hoping it would help.

  When it arrived and I took it out of the box I thought it was broken because the manual and directions kind of suck because to do the step by step directions don't work right. It took some trial and error to figure it out because I thought I had a bad extender out of the box.1st thing you want to do is plug it into an outlet right next to your main router and what that does is let's them sync up to each other.2nd thing you want to do when the extender power button is solid green is push the WPS button on your main router until it's blinking and then push the WPS button on the extender.3rd thing you should see the lights on the extender light up on the Router, Power, and WPS.The Device light will stay unlit until you try and log into the extender.Click your WiFi settings and you will see a new 2.5ghz and a 5ghz and those are your new ones that are broadcast through the extender.I know this is confusing but you need to enter your password that you use on your Internet provider on the new extender and log into it and try both the 2.5ghz and the 5ghz and save both of them and you should see the Device light on the extender light up to green.When you have done the complete install with the WPS feature on your main router then you ready to move it to the other side of the house but don't move it to far because you mighy not get a strong signal. Mine is about 20ft from my main router and it covers this old stone wall farmhouse perfect.The last thing you want to do is hit the WPS button on your router again and hit the WPS button on the extender again and if there within a good distance of each other and all lights are green then you should be up and running but if there not green then you will have to move it closer to your main router.If your main router doesn't have a WPS option  on it then you might have to call netgear online support to help you out because I didn't find another way to install it correctly.Another thing is if the power ever does go our just sync them back up with the WPS button and wait like 5mins and it will work again because you already did all the setup.I leave mine on 24/7 and it runs a little warm here and there but that's normal and I have never had any issues except power outages from thunder storms.Hope this helps someone else but every Internet providers router might be different but I'm using the new Comcast router on the triple play with the works.

  Just so every one understands how this works. It splits your signal in half. So if you have a 25 MPS, the extender creates 2 channels at 12.5 MPS each. It works well and if you have WPS on your router it is easy to set up. I tried to set it up manually and could not get through the instructions without a hang up. So you need to be a little tech savvy. It does do the job. I have it connected to a camera door bell, and a smart TV.

  Bought this to get WiFi into an office where the WiFi signal from our router doesn’t penetrate without having to lay an Ethernet cable.The setup with WPS is painless and the signal reasonably strong.The bad part is that the repeater fairly frequently loses signal from the router, regardless of where I plug it in. This creates problems when your child is trying to do on-line school. Also, the bandwidth goes down considerably. I ended up running an Ethernet cable to the office and setting up an older router as AP, giving me 2 to 3 times the WiFi speed of the repeater.I would not buy this again.

  Better than I expected. Works great for the price. I liked the two different options for connecting. It's a bit convoluted set up that seems unnecessary. I have a metal building that blocks the wifi signal to the Rv outside. I placed it in a crack of the doorway where one antenna is inside and the device antenna is outside (the antennas aren't removable, but I basically set the unit at the best line of sight I could get on both sides of the metal) and ran an extension cord to it. I connect devices in the Rv about 75' away from this unit. And the unit is about 30' from the cable modem inside another room in the metal building. It is currently only plugged in to the outlet, not Ethernet. It does drop in speed some, but very useable. (Actually about the same speed I had with the prior ISP.) NETGEAR customer support tells me the speed should be better if I hardwire it with an Ethernet cable, but I haven't tried that yet because I didn't want to run another line through the inside wall to the cable modem. It was a lot cheaper than the other equipment they recommended for a couple hundred that would have to be hardwired. The next model would probably have been even better and still a good price, but this one is serving it's purpose. The building isn't climate controlled, but the unit is out of the weather. It has worked through the winter. Hope this makes sense to help someone. I couldn't find much in reviews to help me make a decision on purchase for my needs. This worked well.

I have a good signal to the headend router that's about 20 feet away in the house but my speed after a series of tests is ~14 down and ~2 up on 2.4 Ghz.  That's barely adequate.Did a firmware update.  Ran a long ping test to google.com - times were 16-3664ms with a average of 51 with a 1% loss.  Average ping time for my other network which uses the same cable modem is and another router is 21ms with lost packets less than 0.1%.  Still not good.

I have reconnected it to my router more than that. I've done everything support has suggested and nothing works. All I get in the end is that it must be a weak connection. If it was a weak connection, this extender wouldn't pick it up at all!!!! It's like it goes into sleep mode when not in use and you have to restart entirely to get it to wake up.Worthless.

  First one that arrived bricked during the update once I got it hooked up. Customer service is obviously off shore customer service and it is very apparent that they are not technical at all and are simply reading from a script.Amazon customer service was very quick to ship a replacement.  Unfortunately when I received the replacement it would say it was broadcasting in 2.4 5, but I could not get a connection to the 2.4. I tried with multiple devices (two Android phones, Android tablet, and a laptop).  So, back to customer service. This person was even less skilled than the first person I spoke with. They wanted me to set my router back to factory default. Why should I have to that when the problem is with their device? I can connect to my router's 2.4 with no problem. The customer service agent said that it must be an issue with the hardware and said I would need to send it back. That would make it the third device. So I asked for a higher tier of support. This was going to be a call back sometime within 24 hours. Who can wait around their house for 24 hours to wait for a call back.Fortunately I was able to resolve the issue on my own with some trouble shooting skills. However, the extender offers no better signal than my router it's supposed to be extending. I tried several areas of the house with no luck.From the number of high star reviews I am surprised that the product performs as poorly as it does.The killer for me on top of the poor product performance was the VERY poor customer service. And that phone call that was supposed to be within 24 hours never happened.Ordered a Google Mesh system and the difference is astounding. Guess you get what you pay for.

  I should have known this was going to be another bad product from Netgear. The reviews sounded so good.

The Amazon description of this WiFi extender said reception was up to 1000 sq. ft. but it didn't even pick up a signal 20 feet away from the router. When it did work, it would take so long for a website to load, or else once a page was loaded, you then got the annoying circling/buffering. I contacted customer support. What a joke!! They're answer to everything is Factory Reset. Sure, after I spent over a half hour getting it installed and trying to connect the device to mywifiext.net. So, I did the reset and lo and behold, THE SAME PROBLEM, no improvement!! I asked if the signal channel could be switched to different one from the router and other surrounding WiFi's. She had to ask someone and they said no, channels are fixed. It seemed like she was reading from a script, as she kept repeating the same thing, plus she was not in America, and so it was difficult to understand her (mind you, I speak 5 languages, so I am used to accents). Luckily, I was able to return the piece of junk and get a refund. ***I suggest that anyone looking to improve WiFi reception  buy a mesh WiFi system like eero or google nest.

My ps4 has to be in a different room though, and wireless it only gets ~25mbps. I used this and plugged my ps4 into this product via ethernet, and only got ~25 mbps. My Switch can connect wirelessly to 5G, so it gets ~45mbps in the same room. I plugged in my Switch to this product via ethernet and I got an average of ~30mbps.So in summary, this will certainly EXTEND your network, but it will in no way increase the speed as if the device was either right next to the main router or plugged into the main router via ethernet.

  I am a long time IT/Network guy and I ran into and issue that is not documented well, other than in some of the forums.

The only reason for 4 stars vs 5 is it had only been up and running for a day and the documentation could use some work.Although the setup wizard and manual are pretty straight forward, they forgot to include a KEY piece for troubleshooting.  I have an Asus RT-66U router and I use MAC filtering for 2.4and 5G bands.  YOU CANNOT have this enabled and use the extender.  Although they give you 3 diff MAC addresses  that I tried to add to my filter table, it did not work as it should as it supposedly virtualizes your real MAC address to a variant of that in the extender.You will know that MAC filtering is your issue because it will connect tot he extender, but will show ""No Internet Connection"" and you will not get a DHCP address, but instead it will start with a 169.x.x.x default address when DHCP can not be obtained.Once I disabled my MAC filtering, all is good and I still have decent AES encryption in place.

    Not Impressed - Too many Issues - Drops Signal Often
  
",2.0 ,Melissa S,"Reviewed in the United States February 2, 2019","









  
  
    
  I wanted this to set up a existing security camera system to my wifi because it has to be plugged in but is not near my router (one wall in between).  So the problem that I failed to notice is that it is a ether net plug and not USB.  So in order to connect to my monitor I needed a adapter ether net to USB. Also, set up was a bit more involved that I would have hoped.  I would have loved plug and play but that did not happen.  I wanted to create a new user name and PW for 2.4 and 5 but it defaulted to my existing modem name even though I set it up with new names and PWs, it did not accept them and defaulted to the modem names so I kept trying to sign in and couldn't figure out for a while why it would not let me.  No matter what I did it would not let me change them to new names and PWs.  I have set up my fair share of routers and extenders and never had a issue like I did with this one.  I tried to call support but could never get anyone on the line after literally 50 minutes of waiting on hold.  I emailed the company and again no response.  Finally, the range on this is not great.  It is not far from my router but it tends to drop the signal often.  Not impressed.

  This unit was easy to set up (I did have to visit the website for specific instructions, which  would expect anyway, and the instructions were clear and simple, even for someone as old and tech-ignorant as myself. Now we get a wifi signal as strong in the farthest room of the house as we right next to the modem. Cheap, simple, effective. No need to say more.

  For some reason, my daughter's bedroom was the one place in our house that our WiFi could not reach- even after upgrading the FiOS router to their extended reach version, nothing worked. My daughter is a teenager and is by far the biggest bandwidth hog in our house, so our data usage was getting maxed out by the middle of each month because of her. Finally, I bought this Netgear range extender as a sort of ""Hail Mary"" attempt at fixing our issue. For the price I paid, I figured it had no chance of working, but I followed the steps to set it up- very easy by the way, and plugged it into the hallway outside our bedrooms, thinking it was a good spot to reach the FiOS router and my daughter's room. When the extender is working, it shows up as a new WiFi network, with a similar name to your existing one. Well, my daughter connected to the new network and has not dropped off one time while she is in her room, and we've had this device in place for over six months. It's slightly bulky when plugged into an outlet, but really only slightly larger than an adapter that you would use for your Kindle device, so not too bad, but it is without a doubt worth every penny. This is one of the best purchases I have made on Amazon.

  Absolute waste of money. I'm fairly tech savy, but far from an expert. Instructions? There are none. Looked on the internet and found some decent information. Going thru all of it, the signal for our kindles, phones and the were WORSE with this extender, than with it. We have a better router which is fine. It's just that we need a signal that can go about 600 feet thru normal walls. Will be spending money to buy something else. Will use the other one quickly in case I have to return it. Save your money for something better.

    Great WiFi For Price! - Intermittent Service Problems

  EX3700 Review:  I originally started with the cheap TPLink because I have a small 1,000sf place and didn't need much, but I get interference from who knows where, so I needed a booster/extender.  The TPLink was awful, so I returned it.  The EX3700 works amazing and is easy to use, EXCEPT it has intermittent service interruptions.  This only happens maybe once or twice a day, because I think it overheats.  I returned it twice for a new one and it does the same thing every-time without fail.  You just have to unplug and plug it back in to reset and your good for another 1/2 day (usually).  I sometimes throw it in the freezer because it's hot and that makes it last longer.  The service is amazing for the price, 70mbps (5ghz) no problem, my service tops at 100mbps for reference.  It will frustrate you overtime if you work from home or use it for extended periods of time.  I still think it's great for the price and want to give it five (5) stars, but because of the service interruptions it's a four (4) star.

  This product relays the signal with sufficiently for streaming HD video content at a slightly reduced strength.Scenario: We have a 1 BR apartment with concrete walls partitioning the bed room and living room. The router is in the living space. The concrete walls reduce the router's signal strength in the bed room to nearly zero, preventing even loading the google domain in a mobile browser.Results: We placed the device at the intersection of the hallway leading to the BR and the hallway leading to the living room. We positioned the device antenna's to receive signal directly from the router and direct the extension network through the bed room door, directly at our Roku TV. The extension network signal picked up by the Roku TV is slightly less strong but sufficient for streaming titles on Netflix without quality deterioration. Keep in mind, we have the highest speed internet package provided by Xfinity, so I'm unsure of the quality given a weaker/slower root signal.Conclusion: Very happy with our purchase as it satisfies our needs for an affordable price. I believe the adjustable antennas are invaluable for ours and most other people's purposes, as it directs the network in the desired direction. Without this, we may have needed two of the cheaper devices without adjustable antennas. We have had this for less than a month, so I cannot attest to durability. My only caveat with this device is that the antennas rotate on a single axis, meaning that we cannot adjust them directly outward from the side of the device, as if it were on a ball bearing, but simply in a 360 degree arc parallel to the device when ""standing up"".

  My bedroom and my internet router are the furthest possible distance away from each other. They're on opposite levels of the house, on opposite sides. Thus, the internet speeds in my room prior to this extender were almost unbearable.It was a bit of a pain to set up because I kept running into problems with my router's firewall not letting the extender connect (not the extender's fault though). In the end, I finally got it working.And boy, what an improvement:After initial setup in the room where the router is, I put the extender in my room.Before, the 5GHz band could not reach my room, so I had to use 2.4GHz. I had about 60% signal strength on 2.4GHz, and was lucky to get 480p video on YouTube. I was getting 6 or 7 down, 3 or 4 up.Now, I get both the 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands, and I have 100% signal strength on both. I now get solid 1080p YouTube video. On the 2.4GHz band, the extender doubled my speeds to around 14-18 down and 7-8 up. On the 5GHz band, I'm getting quadruple the old speeds at about 25-30 down and 12-15 up.I can't believe that such a small and inexpensive piece of kit could improve my speeds like that, but it did! Highly recommend this.

  Our router is in the basement, where the cable comes into the house, so we had some areas of weak reception. This boosted our coverage area to the entire house and additional areas outside. Our smartphones will go between the primary wi-fi router and this booster without issue. I have not tried it with my older laptop. It should pick up the booster, but if it's also picking up the primary router, I wonder if it will default to that, even if the signal strength is weaker.

  I purchased two of these and I like having a strong connection around my home where ever I go.  After purchasing and using I found out that no matter what, the download speed will be slower than with my router, but it doesn't matter.  I use my phone or tablet when I am in different parts of the house where my router is and I am not usually uploading or downloading anything large, so I never notice a problem.  Very acceptable download speeds.  Also, our phones, laptops and tablet will usually switch automatically to the network extenders or to using the router depending on which one is closest.  I have set them up using slightly different SSID's (HomeNet, HomeNet-UP, HomeNet-Down) so I know which one I am connected to, but you don't have to do that.  It's been seamless and I never need to reboot them or anything.  I also have a Belkin in the bathroom (ya' know...for an emergency) and it works as well as the Netgear extenders.

After redoing the setup a couple of times and doing a factory reset, with the same results, found reviews describing the same problem on the internet.  Finally got it to work after updating the firmware software on the AT&T UVerse router, resetting it, and updating the firmware on the Extender.

  I purchase this to replace an older netgear wifi extender.  This thing is simply quirky.  Setup for me was a major pain, because it will not connect via WPS, nor could I log into the device via the URL given in the instructions.  The only way to get it setup was to connect my Iphone to it, and use the iphone as the setup device.  My first action after setup was to change to a static IP, so I could log in via the net..... at least that works.  Here's the kicker..... After setup, IF a device is not connect to this extender at all times, it reverts to factory defaults, and forces you to go through the setup before a device can be connected!  Yes, you read that right.  At first I thought it was a glitch, but EVERY time there has not been a device connected to the extender.... as soon as I attempt to connect a device, it goes back to factory default settings, and requires me to run setup... EVERY TIME!  You don't dare call Netgear support.....they will withhold the information you need until you agree to pay a fee for it!  I've been down that road several time in the past, and they give you just enough free information, to make you think you're being helped.....then hit you with the demand of a fee (they,ve quoted me as much as $250 for a single support call, then wanted me to grant them access to my computer) before they actually help you fix a situation.  Finally, when it is in use, this thing gets HOT!  Hot enough to smell, and I would suspect hot enough to possibly cause a fire were it placed behind a curtain, drape, or other fabric.  This thing is getting returned, and I'll search elsewhere for a wifi extender.

If on the 5.0Ghz network it will take everything down requiring a reboot of my modem and router. 0 issues without it plugged in. I would say if you need an extender where there are no devices between your router and this extender it should be ok. Definitely not for use in a single-family home.

  I really worry about how inept someone must be to not be able to install this or believe the instructions are insufficient. I'm astonished these people were able to figure out how to open the packaging it shipped in.This thing took about 5-7 minutes from opening the box to using my laptop with the internet it provided. If you've evolved enough to use fire and basic tools you'll be able to figure this out.The thing works great and extends my internet connection to my office perfectly. I highly recommend it.

  I wanted to access my WiFi at various places in my backyard. My main WiFi router is inside a closet in the middle of the house, so the signal wasn't always strong enough to penetrate between 2 and 4 walls. Hence, I bought this unit since it was reasonably priced. Setup was fairly easy but I was initially concerned. The unit takes a bit of time to fully power up, maybe a full minute or more, and you can't proceed until it does. When first plugged in, the power light is orange. You must wait until it turns green before continuing. Give it time!  Then, press the WPS button on the unit and then the WPS button on the WiFi router. Another minute and the connection is established. It doesn't happen instantly. That initial connection provides a 2 Ghz connection. To also get a 5 Ghz connection, press the WPS button again on the unit and then the WPS button again on the router. Give it some time, a minute or so, and you're done! The router light on the unit should be displaying in green.  Then unplug the unit and move it to wherever you want. I used a WiFi analyzer on my phone to make sure I had a router signal in my garage, and then plugged it into a socket. Press the power button to power up, give it a minute, and the lights should be green and you're ready to go. Two signals from the extender will show up: yourWiFi-5GEXT and yourWiFi-2GEXT.  I find that the 2Ghz signal is by far the strongest everywhere for me, so that's what I use. Connect your device using your  router password and you're connected! All around my back yard and throughout my house the 2G signal is strong. The 5G signal is strong in some areas but not others.  So, a simple solution to my WiFi issues. I just installed it, so I don't know how durable it is. If it fails, I'll update the review. But, so far, I recommend it.

    A MUST HAVE FOR LOW INTERNET SIGNAL

  This device is WORTHY OF 5 STARS!!!!  I called COX Communications about their Panoramic Wi-Fi and they wanted $75 one time setup fee and $10.50 per month.  That seemed a little excessive to me for a $49 device.  I ordered it yesterday and it was delivered today.  I purchased this device, because my research showed this was the best device compared to my modem. I have a Netgear Modem with the same specs as this device. It is recommended that the extender be the same/similar to your main router/modem.  I have a two story condo and my main modem/router combo is located upstairs in a closet.  I wanted to get a better connection downstairs for my Wi-Fi devices - TV, Dish Hopper, Roku, Android Box, Android phone and tablet. The package arrived next day as scheduled.  I unpacked it and had a little issue connecting, but one small instruction were left out by the manufacturer.  Once I figured that out, it took me minutes to setup and connect.  Once connected I performed a speed test and I was getting a really good signal downstairs.  The device is sturdy and works great, just as advertised.  I noticed others had issues with setup, but it is really easy to setup.  I'm a technology person and I can easily figure things out on my own.  I feel some others gave this product a 1 STAR because of their lack of technology intelligence. LOL  I highly recommend this product if you have low internet signal in your home.  This WILL fix the problem.

  This extender was the easiest to setup that I have ever experienced. I like the lighted indicators on the device that gives an instant view of the connectivity status. The range of the extender seems adequate for my purposes. The only issue that  I have is that routinely my Google Home and Alexa devices that are connected to the range extender say they can't connect to the internet. Sometime it clears up with no intervention and sometime I have to reboot the router. The indicators on the extender indicate full connectivity when this happens. Other devices, not connected to the Netgear extender continue to work fine. I don't know if this is a router or a Netgear problem. I will give the extender the benefit of the doubt and say it is a great device. If I could eliminate the extender as the problem I would give it five stars.

  Used this to extend my wifi for outdoor ring cameras.  First I plugged the device in near router, once the green light was on I pressed WPS button on device then pressed the WPS button on Xfinity's router.  After a few minutes the synch was complete.  Unplugged device and then plugged it inside my garage.  Had to change the wifi network name on ring camera.  This entire process took about 15 minutes.  Very pleased with the simple product setup and enhanced wifi range.

  Compared to my main router which is an old Netgear N600, this range extender provides a much more powerful signal. Even when both are in the same room the difference is very noticeable.You mileage will vary, but to maintain a full strength signal I could only put the extender maybe 20 feet away from the base station, because walls and ceilings were significantly affecting signal strength.This is not a MESH router. I thought I could have the range extender show up as the same network as my existing router, but instead it has to show up with a different name. So even if you use the same password with both networks, you still have to add the new wifi provider to all your devices that might use it. In a house with several devices and several range extenders that would make the setup a hassle.The dual band ability is nice for where we live because the 2.4ghz band is very crowded but the 5ghz band is almost empty.In conclusion it fixed our wifi issues and I'm very happy, because getting good coverage is always a pain.*There are significantly cheaper wifi extenders out there and maybe those might have worked just as well, but this came from a quality brand (as far as I know), and there are certainly far, far more expensive options as well.

  I wanted a simple Wifi to wired ethernet bridge, this device does do that (and more). The setup of the device is unnecessarily complicated, during the setup you have to have the wifi repeater mode enabled, then you have to go back and disable it if you dont need it (I dont). Netgear miss the mark with the 100BASE-TX port, 802.11ac easily exceeds that along with most cable internet connections today - for that 3 stars. I only got a Netgear device because my Netgear R6400 wifi access point is finicky about older wireless devices where it wont negotiate a reliable connection, older Android phones, gen 3 Apple TV to name two examples.

    Much better than what I had and is an upgrade to their model EX2700
  
",4.0 ,Ken,"Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  I first installed this on a DSL system and I had problems getting very far from the modem/router.  Only could go 10 feet further out in order for it to work.  I just upgraded to Cable/100 mbps with an Arris modem and a TPLink 1750 router.  Now I can move it out to where I wanted it.  When I switch to the network of the extender sometimes it takes a while to connect and says no internet but finally connects.  Speed directly from my modem on the 5G network gets me up to anywhere from 85 to 113 mbps and about 83 with the 2G network.  The wifi extender gets around 80 on the 5G and around 30 on the 2G.  My cheaper EX2700 gets me about 50 on the 5G and maybe 18 on the 2G.  It is real touchy when connecting and if you connect the 2G first it takes less time to reconnect to the 5G.  I have no idea why, it just says no internet connection for quite a while if you start with the 5G.  I think the extender is worth it and has great speed compared to all the cheap stuff out there.  I has two EX2700’s but could not get one of them to connect.  I decided I did not need it anyway as the main router has a very good signal and I almost don’t need an extender.  I also have a cheap wifi repeater in my basement that I was able to install but it also cuts the speeds down to comparable to the EX2700.

  I have 300 meg internet speed when I'm hardlined in on my desk top. My wireless is far from that....it's fast, but no where near that speed (which is understandable). I got the booster to help increase the speed for my xbox that is about 50 feet and several room walls away. I found that the regular wifi signal that I get from my router was more stable than the one I got from the Netgear extender. When running speed tests on the Xbox, the Netgear would fluctuate the download speed from anywhere between 20 megs to 60 megs, whereas my regular wireless router was consistently hitting around 90 megs, give or take 10 megs. To me, the extended then becomes useless, because not only does it not actually help get the speed closer to what I pay, but it isn't stable enough to use for most gaming.It was fairly easy to install though, and generally I have had good experiences with Netgear....just not this device.

  and this time their tech support told me it was after trouble shooting it with me.  For a few weeks it worked well.  Then it started refusing to connect and if I got it connected it was as likely to fail in the next 10 minutes as the next 10 hours.  But what I learned by doing analytics with it was that it wasn't sending out a strong enough signal.  About -65dBm which is right at the margin to stream to a 4k TV.So I ordered one from TD-Link at twice the price and  it's signal strength was in the -20 dBm to -35 dBm range.A huge improvement.  But it didn't work either.  It's on its way back and being replaced by the same unit which will hopefully work.

  I really can't complain too much about this product. At first it was great, then about two months ago it would just stop broadcasting. The only fix was to disconnect from the wall, wait 30 seconds and connect to the outlet. Once reconnected, it would broadcast but then I would be forced to restart TV, Tablet, phone or whatever is connecting to the extender to get a complete connection. It appears that over the past week it has been happening more often. Over the years I have owned quite a few Netgear items. I suppose it's time to try a different brand and see what happens.

  I have a Netgear Nighthawk R7000 and I needed to extend the 5ghz range 20-30 feet. The Netgear EX3700 was able to do this but only for a short amount of time. Once the EX3700 loses wireless connectivity it does not try to reestablish this connection. Instead you have to log in to the EX3700 and run the configuration tool again. When you run the config tool again the current firmware won't let you join your wireless network back to the same SSID. The only way around this is to reset the EX3700 to factory defaults and start over. This is not acceptable.After resetting the EX3700 4 times instead of using it as a wireless extender I turned it into a wired access point. So far this seems to work. The signal is not very strong but for $25 I'll take it.

  The size of the unit is small so you don't have this huge thing hanging on wall outlet. It is easy enough to get set up. That is about it. I have tried various outlets, it has only two walls to go thru yet very little to no difference on signal strength. The wifi speed test is slightly better than without this range extender. I purchased this item to improve the performance of a Ring doorbell. I have even plugged it in to a extension cord and hung behind the wall the doorbell is on and even next to the doorbell with no improvement. For what it is worth the wire less router the extender is coupled with is a Netgear R7800 which does as well or better by itself. The relatively low cost and positive reviews got me to try it and perhaps you will as well, hope your outcome is better.

  What I didn't know: You must choose your either the router or extender.This device isn't what I thought it was, which was to seamlessly extend my home wifi from one area to another i.e. walking from the strong signal from the house to out into the garage, to back into the house.The extender takes your wifi and adds an extension (re-names a second network), so you must choose which network you want to be connected. An example would be, if you were in a parking lot, saw a list of available networks which you could get free wifi, say, Starbucks or Barnes & Noble. You have to choose which one you want to connect. So this isn't that good for moving around the house with with your phone, laptop, or tablet.

  Great Product, read the review from the Network Engineer so that was helpful in evaluating it. Keep in mind that if you want to use it as a WiFi bridge it will broadcast a 2.4 and 5 GHz signal if you so configure it. Setup was easy, no crazy settings to change on your computer while setting up. Recommend setting it up from final destination with a laptop of smartphone, that way you don't have to play with placement.  Speeds once properly set up and calibrated to WiFi router were very good. Only added a 1-3 ms penalty on most latency measures.  Not a scientific study just anecdotal experience.  Great for extending your network to your expensive TV that has a mediocre 802.11X module or computer, etc. If your a gamer worrying about latency in your twitchy games then make sure you get a physical connection not a wireless range extender. This would be great for most other use cases.  I can play FPS just fine with this unit so your mileage may vary.Antenna from unit is good but not the best.  This is just the limitation of radio signals and this small, efficient unit.  Honestly the best way to use this device is to run a <300 ft Ethernet cable from your router to this unit.  That way you get the best of both worlds and pay wireless overhead twice.Somewhat concerned with longevity, since this unit gets a little warm and there is no active ventilation.  Passive cooling should do the job but for this price point its forgivable.Overall a great buy!

  Purchased this to extend range.  The setup I had was a 6th generation Apple Extreme which I extended with a 2 nd generation Apple Express.  I have 400 mbs service.  I now have the Apple Extreme and the Netgear unit.  I currently have all ac standard devices for personal use.  The Netgear extender boosted the signal from 29mbs to 79 mbs in the device furthest from the base station.  You have an option to enable the Netgear to extend either or both 2.4 or 5g networks.  Did both,now better signal on Roku device.  I set up the device using an ipad.  Follow the simple instructions and this is as easy as replacing a light bulb.  Just make sure you reconnect any device to the new network and don’t forget your passwords.

The Wi-Fi on my phone would always take at least 3 attempts to connect to the modern even if I were 10 feet away and then drop on a regular basis.

  I purchased this because my apartment has apartment wide wifi, which is great in the office but terrible in our apartment. Set up was easy, we set up both the 5GHz and 2.4GHz bands so that I could have my private network and a guest network, but... didn't work. So then I tried just the 5GHz network, nothing. I tried the 2.4GHz network, still nothing. I kept resetting the thing, trying different network encryptions, etc. for 4 HOURS, and nothing could get it working. Finally I got a connection for a few minutes and noticed a setting on the setup page (By the way, who's the genius that decided you need to have an internet connection to manage the extender? Why can't I access it by the IP address when it's offline?) called FastLane, which lets you set up a dedicated band to connect your device and the extender, and a band to connect the extender to the router. I figured the router probably only had a 2.4GHz band (don't know why it didn't work before...) so I set it up to connect to the router on the 2.4GHz band and extend it on the 5GHz band. Presto, it worked! For a day. When it worked, I got way better speeds on my laptop and desktop through the ethernet port, but it just didn't work consistently. After the first day it kept dropping every couple minutes, I'd have to reset the power just to get it working again. Eventually I got tired of it and threw it back in the box, where it's stayed until it goes back to Amazon today. Reading the reviews, this issue seems like an outlier, so maybe I got a bad unit. But I've heard horror stories about Netgear's tech support, so I think I'm just gonna get my money back and try my luck elsewhere.

  I bought this because I have a really long house and my modem and router are sitting on one side of the house instead of the middle of it. In result, one side of the house doesn't get as strong of a signal. Ironically, the side of the house that doesn't get that strong of a signal is the side that we really need the signal on. We stream movies and live streams to our TV on that side of the house and it gets really jumpy (if that makes sense). But this helps solve that problem by producing a stronger signal that we were receiving at that end of the house. I put in towards the middle of my house. The movies and live streams can go without jumps and lags every 3 seconds and I love it. This is a great product and would recommend  it to someone who has the same issues that I had.

  Received this WiFi repeater booster today.  I bought it from Amazon Warehouse.  It is great condition.  Set up was so easy.  I used the WPS method and it took me maybe 5-10 minutes.  I set up both the 2.4 and 5 ghz channels.  To connect the 5 Ghz channel just repeat the process of pushing the WPS button on the repeater and then the router...then just wait a minute or two for it to connect to the router.  I plugged it in on the second floor pretty far from my router and it is performing really well.  I have a 2.4 and 5 connection which I can select.  In one area, where I was getting next to no signal, I am getting good signal.  The speed is also faster slightly on the repeater channels.I have to say I am very satisfied so far.  I have another generic repeater I got on ebay....I am sure you have seen them.  Well, that one did not work well at all which is why I bought this one.  I looked at the 300 version but figured for a few extra bucks the dual channel and potentially faster speed was better.One more thing....I connected my Fire Stick to the repeater channel 5 ghz and my FIre Stick is responding faster now!  This is an extra bonus.  In fact, the signal from the repeater is strong on the first level as well.This repeater was easy to setup and solved my problem.  I recommend it.Update June 16, 2019Today my Amazon Fire Stick had trouble connecting to the internet. It eventually worked after turning the stick on and off. Later on I went to look at the device and LED showing router connection was off. I had to unplug and replug this in. Not sure if I will return it. Maybe I will have to plug it in when I need it. When it works it works well.June 28. I could see the two WiFi signals but neither one would let me connect.  I had to unplug and replug it in and then the connections worked.  Seems a little spotty though.  I dropped this one star because of the inconsistency.July 18 2019Overall happy with this. Seems to be more consistently accessible. Much better signal than the main signal from my router.

  Easy to setup. Ensure that you setup the extender near your router prior to relocating it. I live in Germany and the houses  are mainly cement and block, so coverage isn't very good on the second and third floors. I have the extender setup in the hallway on the second floor and I have never had full signal strength on all floors in my house prior to this extender. I used my iPhone for the setup and didn't have any issues. It takes a few minutes for the extender to connect to the router. It's basically like having another router for my top two floors.FYI, I did have to set up an account with NETGEAR but I knew that prior to buying the product.

  It's an ok solution for $30 to extend your wi-fi coverage in your home or office. But don't expect the signal to travel too far even when set to 100% via the browser's control panel.I plugged this extender in when I got it. After using it for about a month I'd say it works ok, to fill in a fead zone if you need a cheap solution. But as always you get what you pay for. The 5G coverage isn't that great with this extender, the speed drops off considerably when I leave the room it's in. The 2G coverage works a little better but my router's coverage blows this extender's out of the water in both 5G and 2G. It does eliminate a dead zone at the back of the house however, but Internet speed isn't too great when using the extender unless you're pretty close to it. It seems to receive signal okay, just has a problem with low transmit power.

  I don't understand... It's so easy to set up yet so difficult, worked the first time I installed it and then it suddenly stopped doing its job, to give extended wifi signal (Internet may not be available.

I tried everything to fix this issue: reset to factory settings, moving the extender closer, waiting for the signal to appear, troubleshooting online using the one and only device that could get the signal but nothing seemed to work. I made some research hoping that I could get an answer to my issue and during my research, the only thing I found is that NETGEAR phone support is absolute trash and I'm not willing to waste long minutes upon hours to not get anything fixed. I guess the best thing to do is to talk to your ISP about your options to exntend your wifi range and hope they don't tell you to pay extra per month for extended wifi feature... I am very conflicted whether to purchase a more expensive/modern extender or keep looking for the perfect budget extender, hoping that the one I received was defective or just isn't compatible with my current modem and router setup... 100% returning.

  this thing is piece of crap.I've tried 2 of them now. both present issues below.MAJOR issues:1. it cannot effectively extend a 5G signal to an adjacent room at all, with the connecting device rating the signal it transmits as poor or just not picking it up. I'm trying to get a smart tv to connect to it while it 'extends' a signal from a cable modem router. So I am forced to connect to it via 2G only practically, but even then2. it cannot reconnect on its own to the wireless router it's supposed to be extending if the wireless router restarts or drops its connection and 'reboots' its connection. so i'm forced to manually restart this extender everytime (usually by unplugging it and plugging it back into the ac outlet) my cablemodem restarts which is often.What's needed is a set it and forget kind of solution which I assume the $130+ extenders provide, meaning they reconnect on their own to source or reestablish internet connection to source on own.. this does not do that. And again it's just useless for trying to extend 5G signal as 5G into an adjacent room.I recommend trying some other extender product.

So you have to sign in to a whole different wifi whenever you want to use. Im not the most knowledgeable on wifi so maybe its just me.

  Wifi signal 3 starred because it would have been great IF IT WORKED. Not saying the device doesn’t turn on, cause it does, but the extended SSIDs you get are WACK and useless because they have no internet connection. No matter how many ways I have tried to get this going (I was really excited about this product) it just never worked. I’ve also seen MANY similar issues to mine on NETGEARs website/community. No one really seems to have one fixed answer as a lot of these issues are unique for some unknown reason. Good luck if you decide to buy. It has worked for some not saying its never worked before, at least thats what I gathered from a few youtube reviews i’ve watched. But again I have personally tried following every review and manual and suggestion and way I could to get it to work. Even agreed to boost only a Single Band instead of BOTH like it SAYS it CAN, STILL DID NOT ESTABLISH INTERNET SIGNAL. Also, make sure that before purchasing that your router is WPA security compatible. Otherwise you have to try setting up non WPS through wifi and it’s ridiculous how many times it will tell you on the second (newly made) SSID’s password is incorrect. Even though its the exact SAME password as your original SSID. Definitely can see why this product keeps going on sale! SUCKS!! Ethernet has best possible help to get connection established but defeats the purpose of wireless connections. Plus my ethernet connection kept disconnecting even thought it was never touched. I’ve logged into Genie a thousand times plus. Genie is the most unhelpful mess. unless you’re tech-comprehensive in the slightest you can possibly maneuver, but even so it doesn't hold much power in helping you figure out whats wrong.

  This is probably the worst WiFi extender I’ve ever used. From the flimsy setup instructions to the arduous process of connecting to the device while attempting to set it up would enrage the most patient person. Once set up, the device regularly needs restarts as it tries to claim passwords are incorrect - the same passwords you’ve saved to devices since the initial setup. Restarting is the only thing that solves this problem. The worst part of the device, it has terrible range, it literally cannot extends 14 feet into the guest bedroom.The price may seem enticing, but this device is hot trash in terms of what you get.

  While the setup was pretty straightforward, the reliability was for s**t. I got these because my existing extenders, cheap, no-name brands, didn't support 5GHz and since I was primarily using them for the outdoor cameras, I wanted the extra speed. I bought two of these and the results were identical: they set up fine, you get everything connected, works for up to an hour then everything goes offline. Connecting to the network on them via my iPhone ran me through the setup process, as iff they had never been configured, and despite users saying they work great if you set them up in the same room as the primary router then move them, the 5GHz was frequently unable to connect--5 feet from the primary gateway, and showing 100% signal strength.I'm happy for everyone who gave these 5 stars and had no issues, but these are either going to work great for you like they did for them or you're wasting your money.I'm shopping again to see if Linksys has an extender out there that works on all bands, all frequencies, for more than 5-60 minutes at a stretch without the need for a factory reset and reconfigure. I absolutely wouldn't recommend these for security cameras, since the point is reliable connectivity so they don't miss anything. I screwed around with these for 2 days before giving up on them.

Here are the issues I have with these extenders:1.) they get really hot once running 2.) connection to my Cisco router was hit or miss. Devices would not connect, would drop connections, and/or internet connection would not be available (even though connection was active through the main wireless network) 3.) genie app (wizard) was inconsistent in saving settings... after entering password multiple times on one of the extenders, it wouldn’t save and I’d need to reinput the passwords until it saved them. Not sure if I’ll be keeping these... my experience with consumer grade computer equipment is that when they run hot, as these do, they tend to fail sooner rather than later.

  I couldn’t even complete the setup. It kept kicking me out so the “networks” existed but didn’t actually have any signal. Not only that, but it then messed with my computer’s ability to connect to our actual WiFi. I could connect to other networks, just not mine. All my other devices were still connected to our WiFi. The extender literally cost me an entire day of work because it wouldn’t allow my computer to connect. Even after I unplugged it. I’m returning this piece of garbage.

  This works great. But if you want to extend the unit and not use it as a separate wifi access point, then read this first... After calling Netgear, they walked me through the set up. Since I had already set it up once, I had to reset it. Here's how:Plug in near router. Use a paper clip and push down in small hole on the same side as the buttons for 30 seconds.Wait for it to reset to green. Go into your settings / wifi on your phone. Go through the new user set up process that will come up on your phone automatically. Select both the 2.4 and the 5 ghz for your router and then Enter in your password for your router when prompted. When it gives you the screen with the editable name for your router, take off the _5EXT and _2.4EXT so the name is exactly the same as your normal wifi router. Finish the set up. Unplug and plug it in where you want it in the house. Should work as expected. You can call netgear if you need more help. I hate their automated system, but if you can get to a person, they are helpful for sure.  Netgear 1 (888) 638-4327 from the US (Indiana in my case).So far, after setting this up, it has worked great. Good luck!

  We have the worst WiFi connection at work.  I work in an old mid-century modern building made out of concrete blocks and concrete.  It's a great building, don't get me wrong, but the signal for WiFi is absolute garbage.  Our WiFi router and modem are in the basement of our office, surrounded by concrete.  The signal for the WiFi is strong if you're above the router on the ground level, but once you begin to move away, it deteriorates drastically.I purchased this WiFi extender to help with our signal.  We use an Apple Airport Extreme for our WiFi needs.  Several people asked questions about whether it works with Apple products.  The answers were mixed.  Thus without a conclusive answer, I decided to purchase this product in the hopes that I would be able to get it to work.Unfortunately....it didn't work.  I followed all of the directions in the booklet.  Had all the proper green lights on, blinking, and doing what they're suppose to be doing.  Yet, I still couldn't get a connection from the device.  Rinse and repeat.  Fail.  Hmmm....let me try again.  Fail.I am disappointed with this product.  This product might work for another router, but it does not work with Apple products.

  Do you like to spend your free time troubleshooting a simple device that should work out of the box?  Do you enjoy spending your evenings searching for double secret factory resets and bickering with tech support personnel with barely intelligible accents?  This device may be is for you!From the beginning, my extender lost connection with my router despite a supposedly excellent signal.  It would good days at a time behaving perfectly, only to drop out for several hours, return, drop out again.  Finally, 91 days after the date of purchase (the complimentary support lasts 90 days, coincidentally.....) it lost connection and didn't come back.  The solution?  I dunno, three factory resets and reconfigurations later it came back.  But don't worry, it'll mysteriously disappear again tomorrow.  Junky junk junk.Word to the wise:  don't call the support after 90 days.  They'll charge you for their own crummy interface SW and flakey factory resets.  Factory reset it, power cycle your router, do it all again and eventually it'll work.  Or, throw it out the window and buy something that works more reliably.

  I am giving the NetGear Extender 1 star not because I think it is a bad extender but because ""Universally Compatible--Works with any WiFi router for hassle-free reliability"" is pure marketing hype. It does NOT work with my AT&T Pace 5268AC U-Verse router.The extender links with the router just fine. BUT when you try to do anything, you find you don't have an internet connection. As best I can figure out, the DHCP server in the AT&T router doesn't play nice with the NetGear EX3700 extender and the device trying to connect to the internet via the extender doesn't get the network configuration data needed to connect to the internet. NetGear tech support is fair to middling. They'll nicely walk you through doing a factory reset and following the manual set up procedure to connect the extender to the router but that won't solve the problem.My research suggests that all extenders in the NetGear line may have this incompatibility with the AT&T 5268AC router and probably other routers as well. Unfortunately there is no way of knowing if your router is going to work with this extender. If you decide to give this extender a try, don't waste your time troubleshooting if you see the ""No Internet Connection"" error. It is not something you are going to solve unless you are a real networking ninja.If you have an AT&T router, you should look at the AT&T offering of extenders. They claim compatibility with specific AT&T routers. At least tech support won't have another vendor to point their finger at if there are issues.

I can now game and stream content (up to 4k on Netflix) with no issues. I regularly play games online, and I've had no issues connecting. Signal now reaches my entire downstairs of my house, including rooms on the side that had absolutely no signal before.Sidenote- The extender will provide 2G and 5G bands. I do not have a dual-band router. While most would recommend connecting capable devices to the 5G band, I've had the most success using 2G only.

Thats a joke. Ive waiting over an hour. By the time they return my call, I will not be in install mode and would have moved on with my busy day, or just not be home at all. Waste of time. I am returning the device. I don't have this much time to spend on one so called simple install.

  I wasn't sure how good or bad this extender would be.  I have never had one. I bought this one in particular due to the brand name,  the many ratings and the fact that the many ratings were mostly 5 star.  I am really impressed with this unit.  It only took a few seconds to set up.  I used the WPS function. It connected right away and I get full bars anywhere in my house and both front and back yard.  I wish I needed another one, I would definitely buy again.  i totally recommend this unit.

  I have a Netgear Nighthawk WIFI router (AC1750) connected at one end of my home.  The signal was weak at the other end of the house (bedroom) having to go through two walls and with a 50 foot distance.  I purchased this Netgear Extender.  It was an easy set up that took about three minutes (including finding a good permanent location).  I tested it with two different devices and they both got a very good signal.

  This device stated it would boost up to 750mbs.  The wifi signal output of this device was actually LOWER that what my home wifi output was.  MY home wifi signal tested at the extender was ~270mbs.  The output of this device was ~ 100mbs.  I moved beyond where the extender was setup and my home wifi was ~220mbs.... the extender was ~90.  I called tech support, rechanneled my router and finally they told me I would have to buy a much more expensive unit to get closer to my speed.  Very disappointed

  I first installed the extender not too far from the basement router.  Easy to follow the set up instructions.  It did extend the Wifi range.  But, it conflicted with my X-10 security system.  So, I adjusted the X-10 house code, but no help.  I then installed in another outlet, still no help.  I did have an unused ethernet cable from the router to the main floor TV already, so I connected the ethernet line to the extender.  It took a day or more to finally register the devices to the router.  But, it did and it now works perfectly.  If I did not have the ethernet connection available, I probably would have returned the extender.  So, mixed feelings about the rating of 4.

  When this wi-fi extender works, it won't extend your network more than 25 feet or so.  The extender needs to be fairly close to the router to get a strong signal.As others have posted in their reviews, this wi-fi extender tends to have a short lifespan.  The first one I got from Amazon set up fine and worked for about a month.  I had it connected wirelessly to a Netgear router.  At about one month's age, it then stopped connecting to it's devices.  Cycling power to the extender did no good.  I was unable to re-do the setup by starting over from square one.  Amazon replaced the unit for free.  The second unit set up and worked OK for about 3 months.  It then failed to serve w-fi to it's connected devices.  Cycling power and resetting the extender did no help.  Since I now have no desire to attempt to reinitialize this unreliable network extender, it's going in the recycle bin.

    Netgear WiFi Range Extender - Problem Solved!
  
",4.0 ,VaNessa,"Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2017","









  
  
    
  We were having major issues with the Wi-Fi in our apartment - the further we moved away from the router, the weaker the connection became.  We actually had no service at all in our bedroom, and I ended up going over the data allowance on our cell phone plan - I was so mad!  So we decided to give this a try.  It's MUCH more affordable than getting a second router through the cable company (an option which we explored initially, but decided against it once we heard the ridiculous price), and it's easy to set up.  You just plug it into any outlet (ideally one that between your router and the ""weak spots"" in your house) and then you find the new Wi-Fi name in your network list - it will be the same name as your current network with the letters EXT at the end, and it will have the same password as your current network.  I am giving it 4 stars because it's not perfect - sometimes we will go offline for no reason, but we're back on within 10 min or so.

  Set up is easy.  The connect is good, when it works.  It doesn't work often enough to be frustrating.  I got this to cover a blind spot in the farthest corner of the house.  It has improved the situation, but not solved the problem of the blind spot.  A reboot tends to solve it, but still requires resetting this device and the main router.It is good enough that I haven't replaced it, so ""win"" for Netgear, but I still have to mess with connection problems weekly.

  Although installation instructions are readily available on-line, they are confusing to the average semi-literate home computer user.  However, there are some You-Tube videos that are quite helpful.  The best application of devices of this type is for a WAP (wireless access point) that requires a hardwired Ethernet Connection to your home network.  All of this is for naught if the device is defective and the manufacturer's customer support is difficult to understand and (apparently) unfamiliar with the product.  This was my experience; I returned the product to Amazon who promptly, politely and kindly refunded my purchase price.

I placed this range extender in the upstairs hallway directly opposite the staircase which according to the range extender was the best place for it to be, I plugged it in and added it to my wireless network and that was all there was to it.  It made a HUGE difference to the start up speed of our home PC and almost eliminated the WiFi disconnecting which was super irritating.  This is great value for money nad I would highly recommend it to anyone who is tired of their WiFi disconnecting on them and having issues with slow running PC's, Cell phones, tablets etc etc.

    Very Good WiFi Extender
  
",4.0 ,Matthew L.,"Reviewed in the United States August 14, 2019","









  
  
    
  4.5 Stars. Had installed for 6 weeks now.I needed this because walls were blocking our WiFi signal from a computer room to a rec room we added on. Getting good signal for streaming movies on our new TV was slow and poor quality. I installed this Extender in the dining area about 15 feet from our WiFi router and 30 feet away from the TV. The Extender to the TV has an unblocked line of sight. When we switch to streaming service now, it's up and running in seconds with clear picture.2 issues that kept me from giving 5 stars:1) THE SET UP INSTRUCTIONS ARE VAGUE. I had to do some searches on NETGEAR's webpage to understand why I couldn't connect to the new extended range via WiFi. The webpage listed in the printed instructions that come in the box is not a website on the internet. It's a set up screen. It only works when you're connected to the new extended network. I had to connect my computer to the Extender with HDMI cord to connect to the newly created extended network. But once I did, set up was quick and easy. Done in literally like 2 minutes.2) THE SIGNAL DROPS OUT OCCASIONALY. Not often, but maybe once a week the extended signal will just cut out and the streaming content we're watching will just stop. The Extended will have a red light indicating no WiFi signal is available to extend but my  the WiFi router shows solid signal. Maybe signal quality or something. Wait a 30 seconds and it reconnects. Usually a good time for bathroom break or refill your beverage. :-)Overall, we are happy with our purchase.

  We were not able to get WiFi reliably on our back porch, so I purchased this product to help with that issue. My WiFi router is also by Netgear, so I hoped installation would be easy. It wasn't easy, but I did, somehow, get the two to work together.One of the primary issues was the brief and poor documentation with the router. There are 12 lights across the router that blink or not, with few people understanding why and the paper-thin documentation of little help. What I did not know was that the two lights on the far right were also buttons, at least not until I determined that they were buttons. The small, silly icons above the lights/buttons were of no help, nor was the pamphlet shipped with the router. However, I did get the router and extender to link with each other. What should have been simple, took a painful couple of hours.The extender did give us much better signal on the back porch. And I could unplug it, plug it into a garage outlet, and get lots of signal to a further corner of our back yard.The downside is that the router seems to reduce the speed of the router, as others have stated.  I did not notice the speed reduction 98 percent of the time; I could still stream videos from major sites without issues. However, I download TV shows or movies a couple times per month. Download speeds were significantly and very noticeably slower than they had been without the extender. I unplugged the extender, and the download speed increased to its pre-extender rate.The bottom line is that I recommend this extender, but suggest that you be aware of potential WiFi speed reduction. You may never experience the slowdown, but if you do, unplugging or turning off the extender temporarily will solve your problem.

  After reading the reviews (especially the non-verified purchasers who left one word reviews), I felt compelled to write my own.  The setup for this extender (hopefully you know that it's just an extender, so it's not going to have the same throughput as your modem) is incredibly simple, if you have a WPS button on your modem/router.  The setup took me all of 3 minutes, including moving it to another room.  Plug in, wait for the lights to come on, push the WPS button on both devices, wait for the connection (for both bands, if necessary), unplug the device, plug it in in another room.  Boom.  That's how easy it was for me.Now, there is an expected drop off in speed, but I now have a good Wi-Fi signal where I had nearly none.  I'm able to connect my phone, my Amazon Fire Stick, and my Xbox without any problems.  Spending $30 on not having to run a cable through the attic and walls...?  That's a no-brainer.

  First off, this thing is very easy to install. You can either go to the website for start up set up or just press the WPS button on this and your router and let it connect itself.It broadcasts yournetworkname_2GEXT and yournetworkname_5GEXT.You can turn off the tick that broadcasts 5G through the website start up set up, but it won't turn off the 5G broadcast from the network extender. Even if I turned off 5G on my router, the 5GEXT broadcast is still there.With the controversy surrounding 5G, I'd rather be able to turn it off completely. Because 2.4g is still fast enough for what I need.

  My primary Wi-Fi modem/router is located downstairs at the far end of the house. Signal is fine downstairs but zero signal upstairs (where the bedrooms are). I’m pretty sure my kids were going to mutiny until I put one of these extenders in the upstairs hallway. It covers their bedrooms perfectly.Now,  my modem does not have a WPS button. So, I had to use the web browser method to configure the extender. It was super simple. I decided to not use the default SSID “....EXT”. Instead, I specified the existing SSID. I have read this can cause problems but it’s working great for me. Devices automatically jump onto the stronger signal. In fact, I’ve installed a second extender upstairs, used the same SSID, and it’s working perfectly. I have an app on my iphone that measures Wi-Fi signal strength - as I walk thru the 3 zones, I can monitor the signal strength and actually see the iPhone jumping onto the next signal source. It’s pretty cool. No complaints from the kids, with all their streaming and gaming and online school stuff.So, it’s behaving like a pseudo mesh setup. I’m very happy with it.

  After 30 days the wifi extender started having trouble and now it disconnects every few hours and needs to be constantly reset. It was moved closer to the router, but continues to disconnect. I don't really recommend it as a long term solution. A side note, if you expect this to maintain your internet speeds you are going to be very disappointed. Be prepared to see less than 60mps on both 5ghz and 2.5ghz even though its advertised as capable of 100mps (standing beside extender). I have a 300mps plan and still even when directly connected to the router it doesn't improve the speeds. The 2.5ghz signal distance is good, but the 5ghz is good only when nothing is between the device and wifi extender. Being in a room 10 feet away with door closed drops the 5ghz signal from 4 bars to between 2 and 3 then speeds slow down even more. As for the 2.5ghz the signal extends good throughout a 5 bedroom 1 story house, but the signal is ridiculously slow. hope this helps.

    Extended wifi range by 30+ feet from inside a 100 year old house
  
",5.0 ,Q,"Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2018","









  
  
    
  I recently helped someone clear out a back building on their property, and upon finishing it became clear that the wifi from the house was almost completely unusable from that room, not available most of the time, and extremely unreliable when a connection could be established. As the room was intended to be an office, establishing working internet was critical. While neither of us had used an extender before, at $35 we decided to give this one a shot.Unlike for some other reviewers, the setup process was extremely painless. I first plugged in the extender in the same room as the router, and after it finished booting up used the web portal to register it with the wifi network (I found the instructions in the booklet to be straightforward, though I did use the IP address from the top review, 192.168.1.250, rather than the URL provided to initially connect to the device). The only small hiccup was at the end when the instructions tell you to connect to the new SSID (a separate wireless network name you use to connect to the extender), after which you are supposed to be presented with a screen indicating success. I was able to connect to the new network but it took a few minutes for it to register with Netgear's web app, which I had to refresh several times.Once that was established, I unplugged the extender and moved it to the end of the house facing the backyard. This is a 100 year old house with who knows what in the walls, and the back building is a good 30-35 feet away from it, but with just this extender the formerly unusable wifi was holding strong at a 60-70% connection strength! I ran some speed tests on the main network and the extender and found a consistent and perfectly acceptable ~30% loss in download speed and no loss at all in the upload speed. The latency increase was only 4-5ms and more importantly, over the course of a few days now, the wifi connection has remained completely stable during everything from web browsing, to netflix streaming, and even with some light online gaming. Highly recommended, if your needs are similar.

  If this review does not convince you to avoid NETGEAR read the additional reviews from other customers I have listed at the bottom.  If after reading those you purchase a NETGEAR product you are getting what you deserve.  I thought NETGEAR would be a solid choice for an extender and was totally unprepared for the very BIG SCAM attempt that transpired.  My intention is not only to give 1 star for this device, but to warn people away from NETGEAR at all costs.  Just as context I am tech literate enough for a simple device setup after 30 years as a Database Specialist.  In a nutshell setup requires that the extender become 'aware' of your router so that it can repeat/extend your signal.  Page 9 of the booklet THAT COMES IN THE BOX with the device is titled 'Connect with Web Browser Setup.'  Please see the attached photo.  Step 3 directs you to a page for 'New Extender Setup Screen' and tells you to click  'New Extender Setup' button .. But instead you are on what looks to be a NETGEAR Page, but no new extender setup info AND almost immediately an unsolicited Support chat opens ..  I did not realize it, but it was a phishing robot masquerading as a human and soliciting info which led to a tech calling me .. at this point I am surprised and amused at how bad this support is, but not suspicious .. until shady tech calls (using name that his parents are not possibly aware of) and will not answer my question about why the instructions do not match the page and why do i need an expert for something this simple (he essentially tried to convince me that customers are stupid) .. then .. without the explicit warning and permission that any legit support tech for a legit tech company will provide and make sure the customer understands and agrees to.. goes into full SCAM mode and tries to trick me into giving him access to my computer .. WTF ?  I confronted him and he actually got tough and tried to defend his actions .. Again I am at the very least tech literate, but was not on my guard due to the origin of this transaction being the NETGEAR QUICK START BOOKLET !!!! Seriously I am sure lots of people get hooked on this ... see The Sept 2018 1 star review telling the same story (with a comment for another customer who advised same thing and was scammed for $90).  NETGEAR is not a legit tech company as there is no way they do not know this is going on.  Amazon as well bears some responsibility.  Do yourself a favor and bypass NETGEAR products.  BTW I tried a number of ways to get in contact with someone at NETGEAR for their side of the story before posting this review, but it was impossible and I went in circles for over an hour.  If you are still thinking of buying NETGEAR then read 6-14-19 review by Chu, 9-23-18 by Miller, 6-11-19 Monteith, 2-21-19 Hughes or 10-5-18 with 'Beware' in title .. One says that SCAM tech support actually left them with a non-functional PC.

  Seems to be a great product. I did have a bit of a problem getting it connected to my wifi. I haven't had to contact tech support so I don't know what that experience is like. I think it took me 4 times of pushing the WPS button like instructed, or 20 minutes to get it connected and working. Not sure if that is normal, I did something out of sequence, or something else happened, but it started working and I haven't had to deal with it since. That's been about two months.  I plugged it in or installed it next to the door to my garage so it can connect to my TV (Hulu) in the garage. My router is actually on the other side of the house (basic 3 bedroom 2 bath house, nothing large and elaborate) and it works fine. Like I said, I haven't had to mess with it since the initial 20 minute startup.

  When I set this product up I found out that it requires that you use an email to set the product up. This is the first time I have ever had any network device demand my email address.More annoying then this was the fact that the product is slow. In my living room I could get 300Mbps but in my bedroom I could only get 60Mbps so I thought an extender would help. The Extender actually decreased my speed to 30Mbps. Maybe this will increase range but that range will be even slower then before.

  Purchased this from Amazon when it was on sale and since I’m a Netgear fan, I thought it would integrate well with my Netgear router. It was very easy to install but...the advertised range for this extender is very questionable. Fifty feet from my router, I could not even connect my Ring device to the extender except on 2.4ghz. I thought the unit was defective and contacted Amazon to replace it. This turned out to be a fiasco..not only was the customer rep. not going to refund me for the full amount that I paid but Amazon had increased the price on the device by another $10.00. Feeling frustrated, I finally gave up talking to someone with poor communication skills (especially in English) and decided to just use the 2.4ghz as it limps along and I purchase a stronger WiFi extender from Walmart.

  Got a WiFi dead spot in your house, Netgear solves the problem.  While using my wireless speakers (Samsung Radiant R1) I found one speaker not performing well due to a weak WiFi signal in my dining room (router is upstairs on second floor).  I purchased this dual band extender and although I could not place it where I wanted, out of sight, it is doing a remarkable job.  I must admit that the install was not quick, since my router does not have a WPA button.  I had to go online and do the install.  First attempt failed but the help link solved the problem.  Took an extra minute or two for the install.  Now I have the extender plugged in my dining room and all of my Samsung speakers (four) work flawlessly, my WiFi is better all around the house and my iPhone and iPad work faster and have no connection loss due to a weak WiFi signal.  I have Time Warner Cable and have been working with their customer service off and on trying to improve my WiFi signal and have had no real success until I plugged in the Netgear WiFi extender. It works very well, what else can I say?

  I had to write this review for folks to whom the speed/bandwidth matters. This is for NETGEAR AC750 WiFi Range Extender (EX3700-100NAS). I have a 200 Mbps connection. I can verify that while connected to the 5Ghz wifi or hardwired via LAN cable. The setup process was very easy and very informative - I should give some compliments for that. Even a non technical person can set this up very easily. I created 2 new wifi SSIDs , one for the 2Ghz and another for the 5 Ghz band. I sat exactly in between both the routers, the personal one I had and the netgear extender(10 feet to be exact). I made sure there are no interferences on the channel I was connecting. When I connected to Netgear, the max speed I got from various speed test results were between 110 to 120 Mbps. When connected to my original router, I still got my 200 Mbps plan speed. To extend the testing results, I moved the netgear extender some 20 feet away from my personal router, the speed went south between 90 to 100 Mbps. So, to conclude, Netgear definitely dropped 40% to 50% of my original speed inspite of no channel interference. So, for folks who ""just"" need connectivity and don't care about speed to read emails and watch videos, i certainly recommend this product. But for folks who want to get maximum juice out of their internet to stream 4k videos, this product will not help you. I hope this review meant something to someone. This is just my personal experience. I give this a 3 star.  God bless.Pros :Easy to set up, very informativeGood product for not so picky internet usersCons:Doesn't give you the original speed as advertised. 40% to 50% loss in speedNot recommended for speed hungry internet users

  Two of these, placed one in the basement, one in a hallway, eliminated entirely all of my connectivity issues ""wireless"" speaking.  Though they do not tell you to do this, I recommend changing each to it's own sub-net (from 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.xxx.1), so each has it's own subnet.  Then also, set the SSID to be the SAME as your router!  Not different, as the instructions say.  By doing this, and then telling all devices to automatically choose the BEST signal, you will see that everything keeps on working seamlessly!

  This product only connected with my Comcast high speed router after many tries.  Even when plugged in adjacent to my router, this speed of this extender was only 1/2-2/3 the speed of the router.

That takes a lot of balls.I got in touch with NETGEAR's IT department. The technician took control of my PC. (It really makes me nervous to turn over my PC over to a third party) The guy tried to get the device to work but could not figure out the hitch. Just when he was going to upsell me on a service that might fix the problem, I told him we were done and that this NETGEAR POS was going back the following day.Perhaps all of this trouble is by design, just to sell customers crap they don't need and did not ask for. But it comes as no surprise that the unit was reduced $7.00 from the time I bought it on Amazon to when I received it the following day.The entire experience was sketchy.Tomorrow I dump my Netgear stock too.

  Between the fact the unit itself is hot when running, the terrible 5GHz reception (I can't get it to make a usable connection to my router, from a few feet away, when my laptop can get a usable signal across most of the house), the ridiculous requirement you supply it (and Netgear's marketing department) a real email address (which you'll use to log in to the thing), the tortuously slow web admin site, the lack of a seamless handover (it appears as two separate networks), and the fact it works as two separate routers (you can't route both 5GHz and 2GHz through the 5GHz connection to the router, for example, not that the 5GHz connection works), I really can't recommend this extender. I ended up giving up using it for its primary purpose, and it currently serves as a (very inefficient, given the 5GHz band is barely usable) Wifi bridge.

  Since we have a 2 story house and the internet modem and router is downstairs where the cable connection is located, I wanted a device that would allow us to get extended range upstairs and in the garage. This is paired with a Netgear N600/WDR3400 and was easy to set-up and use. I tried placing it in different locations and settled on the location where it seemed to provide the maximum range to all the rooms upstairs and in the garage. Since installing it, we have been able to receive good, uninterrupted wi-fi connection in those places, whereas before it was intermittent. I didn't rate it a five because it took some experimentation to find the best, most consistent location to place it.

We live in a one bedroom apartment and for some reason our WiFi signal can never reach our smaller devices (phones, tablets) in our back room, even though our router is only on the other side of the wall in the living area.

But if you don’t know your WiFi name and password you can still set this extender up using the WPS button on the extender and your router.I just plugged in the extender in the closest outlet to my router, opened my WiFi manager screen on my laptop clicked the one the directions told me too and then the setup window opened, I just followed the steps it told me too. After it was finished setting up I unplugged the extender from the outlet and moved it into my bedroom and connected all my devices to it.

  REVIEW:I tried this and was disappointed.I live in an 1100 sq. Ft. apartment with a fairly average layout. Master bedroom down a short hall from the living room which has an office nook where the modem and router live along with the personal computing equipment.I have an Apple AirPort Extreme bade station that I use as a router for all my wireless devices, which is setup on bridge mode and plugs into my arris modem from Charter m, as I am a subscriber to their Spectrum service.My AirPort Extreme does fairly well throughout the majority of the apartment, but due to the layout of the walls, going into the master suite causes the WiFi signal to rapidly fade as you approach the back wall, which is a straight shot from the door, no more than 13 far away.I purchased this WiFi range extender in hopes of curing this problem. I was sorely disappointed. If my phone or tablet (or the wife’s) managed to actually connect to the extension network, it was slow and spotty at best, often times seeing no actual improvement over the main network.Using a WiFi mapping app only revealed what I suspected: the WiFi was being broadcast strongly enough measuring in dB, but my phone didn’t operate as if this was the case. In most areas where it showed my devices as having a strong signal, the download speed was still drastically below the “up to” speed, and noticeably slower than the normal speed I gauged on speed test sites.I promptly returned this device as it did not solve any of the issues I had, and even created more as when I would be in the living room near the aI report router, I would still be connected (with a strong signal, no less) to the Netgear network, with little to no actual internet connection. The hassle of having to go into settings and manually disconnect and reconnect to the different networks was not worth the $43 I paid on amazon after taxes.

  I was having tons of issues with my modem and router. This lead me trying out a bunch of new wireless options. Eventually I ended up returning all the routers I bought and to upgrading my modem. Unfortunately the wifi signal from the new modem wasn't reaching as far as the old set up. After trying a  few different routers and modem options I decided to buy one of these extenders. I got the dual band version and my life is so much better now. I cant believe I didn't buy one of these sooner. The set up was very easy and it plugs into a wall outlet so its very discreet. So far I have had no troubles with the extender. Set up was very simple and was completed within minutes. The dual band set up is great, I love having a 2g extension for my phone and laptop as well as having a 5 g connection for my television.**Update** In the beginning I had a couple of instances where the connection got reset and I was prompted to go through the set up wizard again. I thought the unit was defective but I realize now it may have been an operator error. The hallway that I have the extender plugged into is narrow so it may have been bumped and come unplugged by someone passing. The issue has gone away and I have not had to go through the set up wizard again. I am very thrilled with the product. I still can't believe it took me so long to buy one of these in the first place. I don't know how I lived without one.

Connected with WPS button, but could only connect to 2G only. Had to dig out the laptop to set it up with each band, 2G & 5G. Pretty straight forward, took around 10 minutes. I mounted in garage 75 feet away from home router. I'm using FIOS by Frontier, 150/150 on 5G. It does 50/50 on 2G.Up and running so its time for speed test. I tested both bands 5 times to get an average. 2G was 40 down, 30 up. 5G was 120 down 100 up.TP-Link AC750.WPS took 5 minutes to marry up. I did the double WPS but didn't get the 5G band. Had to go to website & set it up manually with passwords. No big deal, still an easy process. Time to test speed. Unplugged Netgear & put TP in same wall plug. Tested again like above, both bands 5 times for average. 10 down, 15 up on 2G. 40 down and 35 up on 5G.The Netgear outperformed the TP by almost 4 times the speed. My purchase was to speed up reaction time to 2 ISP cameras. Scrolling thru both cameras, the Netgear extender made the reaction time much faster.Both extenders were mounted 10 feet under the cameras, so the signal strength was 100% on both.Every situation is different, that's why I bought 2 different brands to test. I'll put the TP in the bedroom so the wife can have it. I'm sticking with the Netgear for performance....

  The device functions, but barely. It works fine if it's next to the wifi router. If I place it a room over to help extend the signal, it will fluctuate the boosted signal strength from anywhere between 5% to 15%. It remains wildly inconsistent and unreliable. I am hesitant to even bother trying another extender when I already have a cat5 cable and a power drill I can run through the basement. In either case, this device was a waste of time and money.

However, this was one of the easiest products to setup and use that I have ever installed. The entire process including reading the directions took only about 20 minutes from start to finish.The extender has enhanced the wifi signal throughout the 3 rooms where it was needed and has greatly improved the viewing of streaming on our televisions. Additionally it has improved wifi cell phone capability and computer capability.I would recommend this product to a friend.

  We got this about 7 months ago.  Worked ok for what we needed it to do.  Had trouble setting it up, but eventually got it up and running.  It also, as other reviewers have said, runs very hot.  Was never able to connect to the 5ghz network.  It would show it was up, but when you tried to connect a device it said no internet connection.  2.4 ghz was up and able to connect to.  The device started to fail a week ago.  It lost all of its settings, so we had to set everything back up again.  It worked for 2 days, then we were unable to connect anything to it.  It showed the wifi was up, but nothing was able to connect.  Went to contact customer support, but was told it was out of warranty and we would have to pay for support.  We saw it has a year warranty, wrote an email to tech support and asked for a replacement.  They then replied saying they would like to help us.  Talked to support, went through the troubleshooting and none of it worked.  They offered a replacement if we paid to ship the defective one back to them.  Decided not to get a replacement from them, and are going with another product that will work better hopefully.

  I bought this because of the rave reviews but in my experience it doesn't extend the wifi signal as far as expected. I bought it to use with my outside security system and it extended the signal about 20 feet. Setup was a bit confusing but once i found the correct instructions it was a breeze. Looks good, built solid, just wish it had better performance.

  No matter how I set this extender up it would not extend the 5g network from my Net Gear router, the extender showed it was connected to the 5g signal with a 100% signal strength but no matter what configuration I tried through the fast link software for the extender it would not extend the 5g network, I went online and I am not the only one experiencing this issue, seems to be connected to the latest firmware update. Koodo's to Amazon who has a great return policy!

  I realized I needed an extender when I was in different areas of my home. Because I have wifi through Comcast I called them to say I was experiencing dead areas in our home. They suggested I go to their local Xfinity store and pay $120 for a package of 3 Wifi Extenders. I said I only need one. Of course they don't just sell one. Now that I knew exactly what I needed I came straight to Amazon and bought the Netgear Range Extender and it's perfect! Very easy to set up which was my biggest worry. The price was amazing and now I can sit on my patio and work on my devices with no issues whatsoever. Very happy I didn't waist $110 on 3 extenders I didn't need.

  This is such a crappy product. First of all I have ASUS AC1900 router which broadcasts both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz. I need to extend both of them. NETGEAR AC750 advertises that it can extend both of them under different SSID such as your ""original_SSID_Ext"". So under basic settings, it grabs both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz from ASUS AC1900 and translates both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz under different SSID which is fine, however only 2.4Ghz works and 5Ghz will say no internet connection on the extension networks. So, reading other comments I came to conclusion that it cannot translate both at the same time.Fine, screw 2.4Ghz since it's overcrowded anyways, let's try to extend 5Ghz only. Netgear has FastLane Technology option which broadcasts only one band, and it has two options: 1. catch 2.4Ghz band and rebroadcast as 5Ghz; 2. catch 5Ghz and rebroadcast as 2.4Ghz. THERE IS NO 5Ghz to 5Ghz rebroadcasting option meaning no matter what option you choose, your speeds are bottlenecked at 2.4Ghz! This is plain dumb. I don't know why on earth I need to rebroadcast 2.4Ghz as 5Ghz if it is bottlenecked at 2.4Ghz anyways when it travels from ASUS AC1900 to NETGEAR AC750.Conclusion, no matter what, it WILL NOT EXTEND 5Ghz network (grabbing 5Ghz and rebroadcasting 5Ghz)! I tried both original firmware and I tried resetting after upgrading to the latest firmware - product behaves the same way.Additionally, this NETGEAR AC750 has such a week signal. I am sitting on my laptop and iPhone right next to it and signal is worse than if I am connected to ASUS AC1900 which is in a different room across the wall. In other words the area where I want extend my wifi is covered better with my original router which defeats the purpose of this extender.Images are included

  I have been using this extender for 8 months now. It has been working fine until today: I was trying to update the firmware, but for some reason the connection between my computer and the extender was disrupted in the middle (always a big no-no). Afterwards, the green power light keeps blinking. I read online that this is a sign of firmware corruption. A few more searches revealed a solution from Netgear. I followed every step of the instructions, but that did not work for me (after manually setting the IP address for the extender, I was able to ping the IP address from command prompt, but nevertheless I was unable to reset the firmware using the tool provided). Frustrated, I was trying to contact Netgear to to seek help. I bought the extended in Sept, 2017 and now it's May 2018, so I'm still under warranty (as confirmed on my Netgear account). However, to my surprise, they provide free phone support only within the first 90 days of purchase. In order to talk with someone, I need to pay $49.99 for their ""Premium Technical Support"". This is bullshit. I'm not going to pay to talk to tech support for an item still under warranty, and much less to pay $49.99 for an extender I purchased for $39.99.That's it - I will never use Netgear ever again.

  Chose this after a bit of study; braced myself for the install. Have 2.4 and 5G optic fiber bands which laughed audibly at my old repeaters. Need signal on three floors of old house (please pardon the trouble, giant telecom company. Router needs to be n close proximity to biggest, most fabulous TV downstairs that we stream from. And in line with home office. Thank you!)Anyway: Followed the repeater instructions (while keeping in mind the tips from the IT guy who posted a review here). Plugged this little baby in in near the router, waited nervously for it to connect - ah! - and then pressed the WPA button on this then my router. They chatted for a bit. Then: Bing! Connected. Repeated procedure. Little longer wait, then: Bing! 5G connected (apparently). Shut the repeater off, took it up two floors, and plugged it in near my office computer. Minute later, green lights, yass. Now my computer found four networks; two were extensions from this device. Just type in your router password and click - connected. No issues whatsoever. Of course, I speed-tested each one, because as you probably know, the number of bars is no reflection of the speed when you use a repeater. For me, the extended 5G connection was the winner - is blazing fast. And the install was *dead simple* - I think it took five minutes. Very happy and delighted! Highly recommend. (Will update if there is a need.)

  Summary: Easy to set up, functional and useful for extending Wi-FiPros- Expands both 2.4 & 5 GHz networks- Can be used as an Extender (Wi-Fi Repeater) or Access Point (Wired)- Inexpensive- Two antennasCons- Defaults to name of new networks by adding EXT to the end (see setup notes below)- Extends at a COMBINED max speed of 750 Mbps (but honestly, that's fast enough)I really like this range extender. It's a great product for a great price. My only gripe is that you aren't told anywhere in the manual how to extend your network without creating additional network names. If your network is named, MyNetwork, the extender will default to a network name of MyNetwork-EXT.This means your devices will have to disconnect from your first network to pick up the new one. It's not seamless and affects tablets, phones, etc. It also means you occasionally stay connected to the weaker network... This can be avoided, however, by doing the following.Start by plugging the extender into an outlet in the same room as your router. Do NOT user the WPS setup. Instead, follow the setup steps for using your computer (or device).When you get to naming the network(s), just use your existing Wi-Fi network name(s) AND password(s) for the extender network(s). When you finish, it will say you aren't connected any longer,but don't worry.At this point, unplug the extender and move it to where you want to extend your network. You'll want it to be at least 2 bars to reliably extend your devices.On your device(s), turn the Wi-Fi of and back on, let it reconnect and you'll see it pick up your original network, but with a stronger signal.Now your device will seamlessly transfer from your original router to the extender and back!At this point, this is a 5 star product. I'll assess it's functionality and reliability over the next 6 months and adjust my review if needed.

    Slow on 2.4 ghz, and mostly doesn't do 5 ghz.
  
",1.0 颗星，最多 5 颗星,DeeMee,2019年7月13日 在美国审核,"









  
  
    
  I used an old Netgear EX2700 which was 2.4 ghz only.  Worked great, easy to use, fast speed, great range.  Simple as can be.  So naturally I turned to this unit with 2.4 and 5 ghz.This one sets up more or less the same, except unlike the older unit you now have to sign up for an account and jump thru hoops that are unnecessary, a bother if you reset the unit, and only of benefit to Netgear, not you the customer of Netgear.So next problem was side by side with the old unit my 2.4 ghz band speeds were only 40% as good as the old one.  Even in the same room as the router where signal strength was a non-issue.  Maybe I just had a bad one, but I suspect the processor inside is over-burdened to handle two bands rather than one.The 5 ghz band was faster, when it worked, which it mostly didn't.  It was simply intermittent.  Again even in the same room as the router so no signal strength problems.  I reset and started over a few times.  Hurray, the sign in with Netgear hoop jumping is so convenient ....not.  But that wasn't it.  It would work a few minutes.  Not work for long stretches, and then sometimes work again.  Mostly 80% or 90% of the time the 5 ghz band just wasn't working.So I returned it.  Try something else.  I don't have a suggestion for a good dual band extender.  The beauty of the old one was small size, simple and good speed.  Plug it in a wall socket, set it up, and have great extender results.  You hardly noticed it was even there.  In the mean time I'm using some old Ubiquiti Nanostations which are way overkill and not un-noticeable to plug into a hallway socket halfway across my house.

  The ""extender"" could not boost the signal beyond the original range of the wifi router we had. Most annoyingly, it renames the home network the extender broadcasts, making it necessary to log in to the ""new"" extender network to benefit from the signal boost in that part of the house. Not very practical if you happen to be walking around and go from a strong signal area to a weak one covered by the extender. You'll have to log off the original network, and log in to the ""new"" extender network. Might not be an issue if you have a wifi connected device that will remain stationary. Returning this device for one that doesn't rename the network, and really extends the signal.

  I wanted to love this thing, but sadly I just like it. It gave me internet access where I didn't have it before. It's a cheap option for extending internet access, but not nearly as good as a long range router, or adding a second wired router. For sure buy it if money is an issue, or running a cable and adding a second router is not possible.It does work, but it cuts out a lot. I figured it would. I have used these in the past, and it seems they all do it. Maybe it's just the price range, or maybe just the nature of the beast. But it is frustrating. Transmitting through a wall greatly reduces its effectiveness also. Avoid this if possible. If you're in the same room as the extender with no walls in the way, it works pretty good. It's easy to get a full signal with no obstructions. Although it's only as strong as the source signal.It still randomly cuts out though regardless of your proximity, but increases as you get further away.I do like the fact it broadcasts in 2.4 and 5 GHz simultaneously. Very handy if you have new and older devices. You can also give each channel it's own password if you want. Even if the source internet signal is unprotected. Setup is super easy. I did everything through the browser and had it up and running in about 5 minutes. Both channels password protected. You can name the channels whatever you want, completely unrelated to the source channel name. I use this at work so I like that feature. That way no one trys to connect to my channels thinking they are part of the business.Anyway it works well when it works. Useful features. Just cuts out. If you plan to do anything streaming (videos/music), you will need to be in an unobstructed path to the extender.

  I was under the impression this unit was compatible with both 2g and 5g networks. I was unable to get it to extend my 5g.I live in a single story home with both 2g and 5g networks. The 5g works great in the great room (location of the router). But we could not get coverage at the other end of the house, thus I purchased the extender.Original setup seemed straightforward. Per instructions, I connected to the 2g network first, then repeated the steps for the 5g. At the end of setup, I could see 4 networks- both original 2/5g networks plus 2 extended networks. And the 2G extension  worked in the front of the house. ***However I was UNABLE to connect to the original 5g after completion. I would be prompted for the password but it was not accepted. I reset the device but only created a 2g extension. ***This reset the 5g network which now works. IOW, I ended up with 3 - original 2/5g and 2g extended. But I was expecting a 5g extended.It may be that I misunderstood the capabilities so take this with a grain of salt.Pros: stupid simple setup, successful extension of our 2g network to the opposite end of the house.Cons: unable to extend 5g network.

  I would strongly avoid purchasing this WiFi Extender.  I was unable to get any routing from this to my existing WiFi access point after multiple attempts.  I selected Netgear as they are known, reputable brand but it still failed to work.First, I am very technically knowledgeable, yes I am an engineer, and have considerable experience with electronics and networking.I purchased this WiFi extender to extend the range for several Blink-XT outdoor WiFi cameras.  I have those cameras on a VLAN (Virtual LAN) or Guest WiFi network currently.  My initial set up attempt was to manually set up the extender to extend the existing VLAN ) I have for IoT devices.  I initially only set up 2.4 GHz as that is what the VLAN is set up for and all the Blink cameras support.  I manually selected the SSID for that network, and entered the PSK (Pre-Shared Key or password) for that network.  It connected, and showed as connected on the set up status screen.  I went through all the account set up as well.  Initially I connected through ethernet and then also connected through WiFi.At this point I could connect to the extender either through WiFi or ethernet.  However I had no internet access.  I found I could ping the device's IP address, and any devices connected through it.  I also found that IP addresses had be provided through DHCP from my router.  However I could not access the internet.  PINGs would also fail to the internet.After considerable wasted time, a few resets, and additional attempts I decided to at least try the normal WiFi network. I initially manually set that up.  Again, same results.  At this point it is pretty basic.  I then attempted to try using the 5 GHz radio as well.  Again, same results.Finally I tried the basic WPS set up.  Again, it connected with the primary WiFi with both 2.4 and 5 GHz.  This is the basic set up that is suggested for users.  Still, no connectivity.At this point I went to the Netgear website, downloaded the latest firmware and manually updated the device.Then I did a full factory reset, and started all over again with the default WPS set up.  Still the same result -no connectivity other than local.  The router it is connecting to is definitely working properly and is very high performance (Asus RT-AC5300).A few Google searches revealed that many others have had similar experience with this device.  I had read some reviews prior to buying, and figured it was just people not knowing what they were doing.  It is this device, the reviews were correct.So, at this point, after wasting about 4 hours I did another full factory reset, put it back in the box, and requested a return label from Amazon.In summary, I tried everything from as manual set up as is supported to the basic WPS set up and they all failed to work properly.  I tried all combinations of 2.4 GHz, 5 GHz, dual band, and connecting with WiFi and Ethernet to the device (connectivity to the router was always WiFi).  I tried both the primary and VLAN(Guest) WiFi networks.  None worked.I would look for other options.

  Context: I live in an apartment with a built in router, but it is located in a closet and that means I have terrible WiFi connection in my room on the opposite side of my apartment. That is why I bought this. I’m beginning to regret it. This is my horror story.Access Point Setup: The directions state that after you plug this into an outlet, wait for the green light, and plug the Ethernet cable into a LAN port and it will automatically create a new WiFi hotspot to set up. Easy enough! I plug it in and wait. The WiFi hotspot never sets itself up. The router indicator never lights up. Instructions already unclear on STEP TWO. Trying to connect to their mywifiext router website never works. What a disappointment - but there is another way, as the prophecy foretells.(Also a nitpick, the instructions say to plug in the Ethernet cable after the power indicator goes from red to green. You wait 10 seconds once it’s on, not a big deal right? Well the on-off button is on the opposite side of the Ethernet port, so if you are an idiot (read: me), you will press this button by accident several times trying to plug the Ethernet in, meaning you gotta wait for that stupid indicator to go green each time you make this mistake. Torture device. )Extended mode setup: Okay so the Access Point setup is confusing, maybe this set of instructions will be easier. (Spoiler: no)Press the WPS button and run to your router and do the same there. If it doesn’t work (which it won’t the first few times), try and try again. And don’t forget to not accidentally press the on off button which is right next to the damn WPS button on this extender (designed to be a torture device). After traveling between the router and your extender for what feels like a mile run that I haven’t done since college, the router indicator should finally show green.By now the device should work in -extender mode- but you realize that it’s not any better than connecting directly to your WiFi in your room. No, you want what you -paid- for, you are an over achiever, you want that failed access point set up to work and you deserve it. So let’s try that again.Access Point Set Up *Part Two: Return of the Sith*: So let’s type in that mywifiext website that the instructions say and try again. Will the website work? Of course not, dummy (read:me), you can’t use chrome for this, you need to be in safari. I’m glad the instructions totally fail to mention this so your cave man oogah boogah brain will keep trying in chrome expecting a different result each time.Once the website works in Safari, the website will show a big purple button saying “New Extender Mode” - No! Why isn’t there a big fat purple button saying New Access Point? Fine, have it your way. Let’s press it. It forces you to create a new account and some privacy questions. Great, another data breach target. Let’s fill that out. It tells you the extender is successfully set up. Wonderful! Except I still want the access point setup! Clicking next will direct you to the net gear website. Not so fast. Let’s go back and see what the WiFi extender website looks like and see if there is something we can do about that access point.Now, my instincts tell me to update the device firmware. Don’t listen to my instincts, you already know I’m an idiot. When you download the firmware, and begin to set the router up, chances are the download and installation will take longer than 5 minutes to install. And you know what happens when you idle on the router webpage for 5 minutes? YOU DISCONNECT DURING THE FIRMWARE UPDATE. IT BRICKS YOUR WIFI EXTENDER YOU SPENT YOUR WHOLE NIGHT SETTING UP. Ahem. So you repeat most of the steps from the very beginning and reach this point, and this time do not update the firmware. I mean you can, if you don’t idle -  but I believe I have PTSD now and I don’t dare to try lest I be abused by this device and it’s poor instructions again.The Extender webpage does not show any tabs or options to set up the Access Point at this point, by the way.So if you know how to set up the Access Point, please bless me with your infinite wisdom because I am not smarter than a fifth grader, apparently.I hope my review helped you make a decision on what device to buy. If I could travel time, I’d go back and stop myself from trying to install this and yeet it out the window. Or just tell myself to buy a different device entirely.3/5 because it -works-, just not as easily as I hoped.
