  While the tent is well made and easy to assemble, it more realistically holds about 4 people at max. The most disappointing thing was that it clearly says this comes with 6 horses (see the attached picture). I only received the tent, no ponies.

    ELECTRIC FOREST FAM AND OTHER FELLOW FESTIES, BUY THIS TENT!

  My girlfriend and I just got back from Electric Forest. It was my first time using this tent. It was super windy and was raining buckets to the point where there were inches of standing water outside the tent (see photo). Without even treating it with campdry or any sealant, we were bone dry and cozy in this tent for five days, and we only had the rain fly on and a tarp that covered about half the tent. It is a freaking TANK! Been camping my whole life and never had a tent this waterproof. It's also super breathable even with the rain fly and a tarp; the little vent near the bottom is a great feature. Do yourself a favor and get this tent and a big tarp to go over it, and maybe a drop cloth to protect the bottom, and I promise you'll be dry in any storm. Plus, bonus points for being super easy to set up, and tall enough to stand in! Can't wait to use this tent again, it's better than any of the more expensive tents I've ever used.Tip for getting it back in the bag:Fold in half longways. Then fold in thirds longways. Then roll :) rain fly just folded a few times and rolled and had no problems getting it all back in the bag.

    So far so good!!!  Still rating this tent.

  My tent just arrived yesterday. I struggled on what to give this tent for a rating because I just got it.  I was thinking about giving it a 3 for average which seemed fair to start with.  But after seeing how it handled the wind without breaking or tearing, I decided to give it a 4 because it surpassed my expectations.  I plan on using this tent quite a bit this summer so I will update my rating and review as I go.  I found the assembly instructions to be very basic but adequate.  Anyone who has put up a tent like this before will have no problem.  It took me about 15 minutes.  Anyway, I set my tent up in my back yard yesterday to see how it looked and how it took on the elements.  My first test was wind.  I have a weather station and the average wind speed was 7 to 8 mph with gusts up to 17 mph.  The back of the tent was torward the wind and when the gusts would come, the back of the tent would bow it quite a bit.  I have read the reviews some people have written and see some have had problems with the poles breaking.  This is what I was afraid of as I watched the back of the tent bow in.  I wish I had taken a picture because it was substantial.  Anyway, the poles did not break and the tent returned to it’s original form when the gust passed every time.  I have seen the video on Amazon of the testing process Coleman puts their tents through.  Not sure how much wind this tent is rated for but I’m pretty sure 17 mph is close to it’s max.  The tent looks to be made very well for the price I paid for it.  There are only two guidelines that come off the rain fly on the sides of the tent.  The tent is staked down on all four corners of the floor plus a floor vent in the back of the tent.  In all, there are only 7 stake down points that I could see. I feel if the tent had some guidelines higher up on each of the four corners of the main body of the tent it could withstand more wind.  The stakes are ok but bend fairly easily if the ground is too hard or you hit a rock when pounding them in.  I will be buying some better ones before I go camping.  I left the tent up over night and checked on it this morning.  It held up very well and only one of the stakes for the rain fly guidelines had twisted in the ground causing the guideline to come loose.  I left the tent up because it was going to rain today.  I need to know if I have any leaks before I take it out camping.  It has been raining lightly for two hours now and my weather station says I’m getting .05 inches of rain an hour with a light steady wind of 2 to 3 mph.  Far from what I would consider a hard rain but it’s still rain.  I went out and looked at just the outside and the water seems to be beading up and running off the rain fly and tent very well.  It is supposed to rain until 9 or 10 o’clock tonight so I will check for water on the inside in the morning.  I’m hoping not to see any with such a light rain.  If there is, I will definitely be spraying the tent down with a waterproofing spray before I take it out camping.  Now for the pro’s and con’s.Pro’s:1). Great tent for the price.  If your on a fixed budget or are looking for a good starter tent you will not beat this one.2). Very roomy inside.  I plan on using this for two people, a shepherd and, all our gear.3)  There is an eyelet at the top of the tent so you can attach a lantern and two side pockets for stowing smaller needed items like a headlamp, cell phone, keys and, so on.4). There is a small zipper in the bottom front left side of the tent for running wires.  See my picture.  It is covered by a little yellow strip of material to protect the zipper from the rain.  You do not see this feature on most tents.  I plan on using it with my solar panel so I can charge my power core, headlamp, cell phone and, other gear from inside the tent out of direct sunlight.5). I was surprised at how much give the tent had at 17 mph gusts and did not break any poles or tear. It bounced right back to it’s original form.Con’s:1). You may want to consider buying stronger tent stakes.2). I wish there was a high point on each of the four corners for attaching extra guidelines.  Although it handled 17 mph gusts very well the tent did bow in quite a bit.  If I had to guess, the tent was reduce by almost half it’s size. If I was inside the tent I know I would have been annoyed being hit by it every time a gust came. I really don’t feel the tent as is, could handle much more then that.  I’m thinking about how to attach extra guidelines in the corners without effecting the structural stability and elasticity of the tent.  Make sure you pitch this tent in a sheltered area out of the wind if your expecting bad weather.Update 04/30/18I went out the next morning after the light rain and the inside was dry.  The following day saw more rain showers with substantially more rain.  Checked the tent again today and it is still dry.  After reading some of the reviews I really thought this tent would leak. Because this tent has preformed better then expected I have changed my rating to a five.  I am going to seal the seams and spray waterproofing on the tent anyway because I would rather be safe then sorry.  For the size and price of this tent you will not find a better deal.  Just remember to pitch your tent in a sheltered area in you are expecting winds and you will not be disappointed.  I think I have figured out a way to put up extra guidelines on each of the four corners so the tent will preform better with heavy gusts of wind.  I will test it out and take pictures. More to come.That is all for now and there will be more updates coming.

    Great Tent / Great Value
  
",5.0,Matt Hickerson,"Reviewed in the United States April 13, 2016","









  
  
    
  Great tent. I set it up in my backyard, to give it a trial run (and seam seal) before taking it out camping. There are pros and cons...Pros:Carry bag - the tent comes neatly packed in a carry bag, with tent, poles, rain fly, ground stakes, door mat, and instructions.Setup - Easy. Set up by myself, with rain fly, in under 15 minutes. Didn't have to look at the directions. Only suggestion would be to put the word ""front"" somewhere on the rain fly to indicate which way it goes. However, a quick glance at the packaging will tell you.Materials - the tent material seems to be of good quality, and should hold up well when taken care of. The zippers are not heavy duty, but i see no issues with them. The floor is heavy duty tarp material.Screens - the tent has large screen panels on the ""ceiling"", which makes for a great view when the rain fly is not on. There is an additional window, and screen on the door for extra viewing and airflow.Floor Vent - there is a vent near the rear of the tent, which allows for additional airflow.Cord access - there is a small zippered panel in the front corner, that let's you run an extension cord into the tent.Other ""Pros"":I got the Navy/Grey tent, and the colors are cool. Got some compliments from the neighbors on it. I like that the rain fly comes with the guy lines already attached. The interior gear pockets are fine, good for holding your phone. Wouldn't stuff them with anything heavy. There is a little ""ring"" at the center of the ceiling, to hang a small light. While you could technically fit 2 queen air mattresses, I would not. It leaves no floor space for gear. I will put in one mattress, and leave the other half of the tent for my kids Pack n' Play, and gear. It will fit the 3 of us comfortably. However, unless you intend to get cozy, I wouldn't advise this for 4 adults (but it could be done).Cons:Stakes - the stakes are just ok...they are the generic skinny steel ones. I would recommend spending an extra $10 bucks and buy some good ones.Footprint - the tent doesn't come with a footprint, though I imagine this helps keep the cost so low. Not a big deal, I use a tarp anyways.Door Screen - the upper half of the door can be unzipped to reveal the screen window. I really would have liked if the entire door could be screen, not just the top half.I also purchased some Coleman Seam Sealer, and sealed all the seams inside the tent, and the rain fly. Some of the seams are taped, but it's just good practice to spend the time to do this, no matter what brand/cost/etc tent you have. It saves headache down the road.Overall, I'm very pleased with the tent, and the cost. It will work well for short camping trips with a small family, couple, or individual.

    Review from a retired backpacking guide.
  
",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States May 24, 2017","









  
  
    
  To start, this is a fantastic tent to take the family out for the weekend during warm weather. It is spacious, has plenty of headroom, has an awesome full tarp liner for the bottom (I still recommend placing another ground tarp down before setting up the tent to avoid any rips or tears in the tents bottom, let the cheaper replaceable ground tarp take that beating) If you are going for a multi day float trip this tent couldn't be better, or if you are camping where your car is accessible and weight is not so much of an issue this tent is AWESOME. And as far as my comment about the weight, its a 3 person tent, so I cant really complain that much (I acknowledge my bias, I prefer 2lb 1man tents, thought not nearly as spacious or user friendly).I got this tent because I knew I wanted more room for the dog and to get my girlfriend to actually enjoy camping. But I didn't expect this tent to be this huge, we had more than enough room for the two of us and my dog (lab/pointer mix) with plenty of room for our packs.This tent WILL KEEP YOU DRY, I took this tent on a multi day float trip from Missouri down into Arkansas, during which time I got rained on and the river even came up to one corner of the tent bottom and not a drop came into the tent.If you are an average camper who isn't so much into the long distance backpacking this tent is awesome, seriously, you should just buy it now if you fit in that category.Now here are my critiques, and my comments for those more adventurous people looking for a tent.This is NOT a COLD WEATHER tent! This is also the reason I didn't give it the full 5 stars. I took this tent out for a trip to the spanish peaks in colorado and camped out multiple nights. It was mid May and we camped at 10K ft. the night dropped down to the low 20's F and we were freezing, the gusts of wind would run right through this tent. This tent has a big mesh ceiling, a tall ceiling, and a large breathable mesh hole on the back wall, all of this is great for warm environments, however, it does not hold in heat, it expels it. It is too breathable for cold or windy environments.For those looking for a winter tent, I am not saying that you want a tent that is totally sealed up, tents that are totally sealed up cause you to sweat and holds in the moisture, moisture is your enemy in below freezing condition. You want something breathable, but you also want to keep in the heat, look for something with a lower ceiling and a rain fly that runs all the way to the ground, including covering up the doors (people use that area for their boots usually). Tents that have those types of rain fly's will have slots cut out that you can open to get a small amount of breathability out of the rain fly. With the addition of a rain fly like that I would say that this tent would fully fall into that 3rd season they advertise, but without a beefed up rain fly I would argue that this tent is more compatible for summer camping only. This rain fly keeps out the rain exceptionally well, but not so much the wind.  I would also advise any backpackers, to take a wool blanket to set as a floor mat, then lay your sleeping pads on that, you will be much warmer and happier.

    Third tent's the charm!
  
",5.0,Xiola Bleu,"Reviewed in the United States September 8, 2015","









  
  
    
  Our first tent was an enormous Montana 8 person tent that used 6 poles and took 45 minutes to set up properly.  Our second tent was an instant double hub dome tent that had permanent poles that kept flipping upside down making it impossible to set up.  (We returned that one.)  This tent, however, is no-nonsense.  Two poles to put the tent up.  One extra pole to hold the rainfly up.  We put the tent up in a Florida thunderstorm in less than 5 minutes. We took another 5 minutes to set the 7 guy lines.  I didn't get the opportunity to spray and seam seal the tent since it was raining, but it did not leak through some very powerful Florida rainstorms, except for a few drops around the electrical port zipper.  Seal that part especially.  The tent moved around and shook through some rough ocean wind, but remained intact.  The tent is tall enough to stand up in (6ft tall) with room for a queen sized air mattress and tons of space for your stuff.  We had a cooler, a big box fan, and two pieces of luggage in there with room to spare.  I would say it's perfect for 2 people, comfortable with 3, claustrophobic with 4, and you'd have to be desperate to fit 5 or 6.  There is a port for your electrical cord.  Two pockets are attached inside, and a welcome mat was included.Taking the tent down was just as simple.  Just fold in half twice, then fold into thirds and roll up.  It fit right into the bag with no problems.  Easiest tent I've ever dealt with!I'd recommend a 10x10 tarp to go under the tent and a 10x20 tarp to go over it.  There are two huge mesh panels on the top of the tent, which is great for ventilation, but bad for sideways rain that can sneak under the rainfly.  I put the tarp longways over these vents and it kept out the sideways rain but there was still plenty of ventilation.There is a hook at the top to attach an LED light/fan.It was fantastic for warm/hot weather camping.  Might be too much ventilation for late fall camping, though, unless I can figure out a way of blocking those mesh panels.Best tent I've ever owned!

    Tall tent, great for warm weather, LOTS of space!
  
",5.0,Washburn,"Reviewed in the United States April 30, 2017","









  
  
    
  I purchased this tent as a last minute replacement when I discovered all our previous tents had problems that were not things I could immediate fix. So since I've only used this for a weekend camping trip so far, and in ideal weather, I can't answer a lot but here are my opinions on it:- How many can fit?6 KIDS could probably fit. If you're an experienced camper then you obviously already knew this wouldn't fit 6 adults (or even teens) but I just feel the need to specify this. Realistically though if you're using camping mats that aren't larger than a sleeping and are adults you could squeeze 4 with room for bags at your feet. Cot wise I was using a Tenton Sports Adventurer so with using that as a reference I would say you could squeeze a maximum of 3 in there with no real aisle space on either side (maybe a leg width?), this is assuming you use the end point to enter and leave as well as storing underneath the cots. If you want more elbow room then I wouldn't put more than 2 in of that size, you could definitely put 2 of the XXL version of Tenton's cot as well and have space for an aisle between in which case with larger cots you could probably fit 2 couples comfortably if there aren't a million bags to deal with.- Is set up easy?As someone who has grown up camping this is pretty much your standard tent design in terms of set up. I ended up at the campsite well after dark and had a veteran camper along with a friend who doesn't tent camp often for helping me set it up to which it took us less than 5 minutes to put up. Super easy and does not require instructions if you've ever put up a tent like it before.- How is break down?Last day of the camp out I ended up having to break down the tent alone so it took me maybe more like 10 minutes but with help it shouldn't take that long at all. I even managed to get it into the bag WITH SPACE TO SPARE.... I folded in half then into 3rds and it fit without any struggle with everything rolled up in the tent. Still shocked it fit that easily after years of struggling with other tents to fit back into their bags.- Is there headroom to stand?Yes, PLENTY of head room and probably the roomiest tent I have owned to date. I'm 5'5"" and even with a small hanging light I got for the top of the tent I still had an arms reach above worth of room. Closer to the walls obviously it's a bit shorter but I did not feel the slightest bit restricted like a normal small tent has.- Is it warm?On a sunny day with it entirely closed it got a tad warm when I checked in on it but with all the ventilation it has built in already it really doesn't get scorching like some tents do if you don't have any windows open. The first night with this tent it actually got pretty chilly and the tent was assuredly not meant for colder nights, with a better sleeping bag rated for colder weather you should be fine though... mine just was very old and not great against the cold anymore.- Does it hold up to rain?I camped in sunny weather, so I cannot personally review it from experience, but I would say this is not a tent that I would knowingly take on a camping trip that will have rain. The only real reason I say this is because the back has this little vent to let air in around head level if you're sleeping on the ground which is great for summer/warm weather but as someone that has been in a flooded tent before it just seems like a horrible feature if you're going up against a storm. Some reviews claimed this wasn't a problem though so perhaps it isn't as big of an issue as it just appears to be from my perspective at least.Overall I love this tent, wish it retained heat a bit more, but definitely look forward to using it again on the next camping trip! Feel free to ask any further questions I'll try my best to keep on top of replies.

    Waterproof, Inexpensive, Fast Set Up, and Light-Weight (2-Man Tent)
  
",5.0,Eskimoose,"Reviewed in the United States August 24, 2015","









  
  
    
  Good gosh folks!  I bought this 2-man tent due to the low price and the high scoring reviews here at Amazon and the reviews are spot on.  I had my eye on quite a few other tents at $125 to $250 but I have to say this one caught my eye early on because of the reviews.  I said: ""wtf? Order it and see how it performs and if it was all a big lie then I'm out a measly $38!""NOTE: On the advice of lots of folks here I purchased a small 2 oz bottle of ""Coleman Seam Sealer"" (available here or at Wal-Mart).  The day the tent arrived I set it up outside on my back deck and sealed all the seams and let it dry for about 4 hours before folding it back up and putting it away.PROS: This tent is inexpensive, light weight, easy to erect, and does it's job quite well. It assembles in about 3 to 5 minutes (if you've done it once or twice). The instructions are a perfect guide if you cannot remember the 3 easy steps.CAMPING IN THE RAIN:  So I went on my first camping trip with it this past weekend and I was caught in an off-and-on torrential downpour from 10 PM at night through 9 AM the next morning and guess what?  I stayed completely dry and slept very well. I did forget to zip the small electrical cord opening shut for the first few hours and the sideways rain got a few drops in there until I realized it and zipped it tight. I left the vent windows open during the entire storm and had zero issues with water.TIP: Be sure to bring a couple of large black trash bags to put the tent into if you have to break camp while it is still raining. That prevented a huge wet mess inside the car when I departed the camp site.Time will tell if this is a durable product ... but so far so good.  LIKE!

    Coleman 4 person tent vs. 3 person tent.
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States May 26, 2015","

   This Coleman 4 person tent kept us warm and dry on our camping trip this Memorial Day weekend. This was my very first time setting up a tent and camping out with 2 kids and 2 dogs in tow, and it took me just 15 minutes to set up the tent.Set up took 15 minutes from start to finish for a tent newbie like me with some help from one kid. Based on forum advice I got some tent pegs that were easy to drive into the ground so I did not use the ones that come with the tent, so I had a very easy time setting it up. The poles were already connected by a string and I had to thread them through and clip them on with the attached clips. I also got a heavy duty tarp for the bottom of the tent based on advice on some reviews posted here. I had to fold it slightly to make sure it stayed under the tent. then once the tent was all straightened out I drove in the pegs into the ground. The rain fly was easy to install too and the included cords helps make sure the rain fly is stretched out away from the vents.The 4 person tent is 9ft by 7ft and it fitted an Intex Queen Mattress that I inflated in 15 min with a handpump. There was a little room on all sides of the tent after fitting in the mattress. If you push it to one side then there was place for one small person. We had 1 adult and 2 teenagers in the tent and our 75 lb lab and we were pretty comfortable with room to turn while sleeping. There was not really room for more than one small duffel bag after packing in 3 people and a dog, so if you're using this as a backpacking tent and plan to store your gear you can only fit in 2 people. I was glad that I had got this size compared to the 3 person tent (7ft X 7 ft) as it would have only fitted in a queen mattress and no more, and we ended up needing more room. I think the 4 person is a great size for 2 people to sleep in comfortably and have a bit more room to bring in a kid if needed.I had carried a seam sealer but reviews advised not to use it as the tent remains dry. There was no rain that night, just a little moisture in the air. The tent is very well ventilated so it got cold and airy in the tent in the night. Next time I may carry something to cover the vent on one side or maybe a warmer sleeping bag as the night got colder than we had anticipated. This would be a great tent for warmer summer evenings.The white walls of the tent reflect light well and there are 2 pockets on the side where you can put a flashlight facing upward to illuminate the whole tent. Another feature I liked was that the bottom of the tent comes up all around about 4 inches which helps keep dirt and water out. It's also advisable to pitch the tent on higher ground slightly sloping downwards so that the water flows downward away from you.The pull down was just as easy as the put up. It was easy to bring down and fold up the poles. However, I could not fit it back inside the bag. How did they manage to fit it inside that tiny bag in the first place is a mystery. I put the pegs, poles and my extra tarp inside and will find another bag for the tent itself.Now that I've learned that's it's not too hard to set up a tent, I plan to go camping more often with this Coleman Sundome tent.Update 7/9/2015 -The 4 person tent held up well and has been put up and taken down about 5-6 times already. It takes just 15 minutes to set up and is very comfortable in 45 degrees plus weather with a warm sleeping bag. For colder temperatures, I wouldn't recommend this tent. It's very airy and the 2 side windows that zip down made it comfortable even in 70 degree weather. For even warmer days you can leave the rain fly off if there is no chance of rain. I figured out finally how to roll it back tightly so it fits back inside the bag with all accessories. You just need to make sure you have the door and window unzipped so you can let all the air out and then it rolls up tight. I also purchased the Coleman 3 person tent, it is about 7 ft by 7 ft inside and just about fits an Intex Queen size air mattress. On a recent camping trip the 3 person tent worked for 2 teenagers and a dog inside the tent. It is a compact tent for 2 people, you can fit in 2 adults but there won't be any room for bags. It's not the lightest tent I've seen, but it's fairly small and fits back easily into the bag it comes in. We set up this one about 4 times and took it down in different camping grounds. The pegs did not hold up well in hard ground but I'd purchased a set of better pegs from Amazon.I am really pleased with both the tents and will be using them for many more camping trips.Update 9/29/16 - This tent is still going strong, I had my daughter put it up by herself and took a time lapse video. With a little help, it's even easier to put up, but she wanted to demonstrate putting it up with no help. It took her about 20 minutes, if there is someone to hold and align the poles it takes less time. It rained for hours in the night and the next day on our last day - this was a trip to Glacier National Park. We were both warm and dry in our 4 person and 3 person tent and it was kind of fun to hear the rain beat hard against the tent. I had not applied any seam glue to either of the tents, but might do so in the future. Unfortunately, on a subsequent trip in late fall, the tent pole snapped as the person setting it up with my daughter did not have much experience and went too hard. I now have to figure out how to get a replacement pole.

  I am vowing to never buy another Coleman product. I purchased the 4 person Sun Dome tent in 2017. The tent has been used 5 times, stored in the house so extreme heat has not compromised the integrity. While taking down the tent the shock cord from one support pole broke, leaving the tent useless. I contacted Coleman requesting a replacement pole. They refused to replace pole or even offer for me to buy one replacement pole. They recommend I find help at REI.... I did so. They also were unable to repair. The tent now is useless as well as Coleman customer service. REI commented they have had many complaints of Coleman products and customer service. I have spent thousands of dollars throughout my family’s camping years. Never again. I will search other brands and suggest others do the same. One tent pole would have made one happy camper.

    DO NOT BUY IF THERE WILL BE RAIN - WATER WILL COME IN!
  
",1.0,Sean F.,"Reviewed in the United States June 26, 2018","









  
  
    
  I have used this tent twice in the last 2 months. PROS: set up is super fast and easy, and it has a good amount of space. I fit a queen mattress in there with plenty of room for bags. It also has a lot of little features that are useful (doormat, phone holders, zipper in corner to run cables through if you happen to have electric at your site).CONS: The first time I used it was for a 3 night trip where there was light rain once (10 min. sprinkle) and I didn't notice any leaking. However, this last weekend (the second time I've used it and it was for 2 nights) we were hit with heavier rain (no thunder or lightening but on and off heavy rain for about 10-20 min intervals) and this tent could not withstand them. Water was leaking through the seams and coming through the tent causing it to pool in the corners and got my bed and some of my stuff all wet. My friends and I were also sitting in the tent when it was raining and were getting sprinkled on. I have attached pictures to show how much water was coming through (zoom in to see how much water pooled in the corner). It was definitely coming from the seams which makes me think this might have been a defective tent since other reviews said there's withstood storms, but alas the one I received did not. SUPER disappointed since I really liked the tent for the price, but I guess you get what you pay for and I will probably not use it again in fear of water leaking through!

  I bought this item on august, and got it within 2 days. I then set it up at home. Its easy to set it up and my kid loves it. One monthly later, I used that tent in one family campout event in our city park. On that camping night, it has thunderstorms.  i thought that tent would be water-proof and my family could be safe inside that tent. Unfortunately, that tent got a lot of rain water inside and my air-mattress and sleep-bags got wet. Its so bad since my kids are still young, and we had to move to the park office in the midnight since we couldn't sleep in that tent anymore. Its really a big messy. That produce video showed it could resist storm-water and strong wind. But I should realize that that video was tested for water only or wind only. It didn't test wind + rain, which is a normal thunder-storm weather. i was so disappointed at this tent.

   I bought this tent with the intentions of using it as a single and would say is the perfect size for one person and all your gear with some room to spare.Two people could def fit comfortably, although it would be better to go up a size with gear...I felt this was of solid quality... especially for $40 with tax and shipping. The floor seemed durable and all seams were well sealed. My number one concern is keeping bugs out and not once did an ant or spider find its way in the whole trip.The interior has two pockets and two zipped vented windows. The white material inside reflects light well when your lantern is directed towards it. On either side of the interior of the rain fly  there is a picture of a lantern encouraging you to direct your light to center for the best light distribution. At top center there is a small plastic ring held by a sewn piece of fabric that is to hold your light or string a line to hold gear. This is good if your light has an actual hook, but i feel they failed by not making it larger or more pouch like and easier to hold more.The door of the tent is my greatest complaint. It is D shaped and I prefer one where the D has the straight flat part parallel to the ground that allows you to open center arch and step in.This door would open and fall into the tent and require it be opened more than i would like as I would scurry in  at night trying not to allow bugs. Beyond that it would awkwardly hang folded and into the tent when open requiring you to roll it and secure with attached external tassels.The included tent stakes are out right crap. I bent most of them with less force than expected. I will be buying better and suggest you do in advance.Set up and break down was easy, took about ten minutes and could be done alone. Be careful when putting together tent poles as i stripped/frayed the end of one when not lined up perfectly.All in all a good tent for $40

  I'm not a know-it-all camper or anything like that. I just like to go a few times every summer and get away with my dog. This tent is perfect! I live in Oregon, so you can never be 100% certain when it will rain. Ever since I woke up in a puddle in an old tent, I make sure to only buy tents with this ""bathtub"" design.I just got this tent and set it up by myself in my living room and it took me probably less than 10 minutes. There was definitely enough room for 2 people. However, whoever sleeps on the inside/backside of the tent (next to the window) will definitely struggle to get out of the tent without waking/bothering the other person. This is an awesome tent though and I can't wait to try it soon!Also, I was able to repackage this tent back into it's carry bag with ease! There was no struggle at all! In fact, there's still enough room that I can toss a small hammer in for the tent stakes, and a small brush to dust off the tent before packing. However, the bag is expandable if you need more room to carry stuff. Just remove the tag/band on the bottom of the bag, and you'll have more storage room--which is genius in my opinion. Especially after I've really had to stuff some tents to get them back in their bags (barely)!

    This tent is NOT good in rain or heavy mist!

  This tent is not good in rain! In fact, it is terrible. While camping this past weekend, we had a  surprise rain with about 12 hours of drizzle and a few good downpours. The tent leaked at the little zipper in the corner where an electrical corn could be inserted through. I woke up to a clothing bag very wet and a puddle.  There is no flap material to zip closed to cover the ventilation screening material. Consequently, condensation moisture made its way under the fly and into the tent through the side and dome vent screens.  Everything was slightly moist...top of sleeping bag, top of pillows, coats, etc  Also, the grey material (some kind very of thin plastic coating?) applied on the inside of the floor was scraping of in tiny patches by the entry.  I had a 4 layer tarp under the tent and a little bath mat to catch dirt and wet. There should not have been any damage to the floor. Be Aware! This is a summer only tent. Do not expect to stay dry inside in rain or heavy mist.  I am very disappointed.

  First of all let me say that I was very sceptical when I bought this tent, I only got it because I needed it last minute and just hoped that it would last long enough for a week's worth of camping.  I was happily surprised at the build quality and the ease of use, here are some pros and cons:Pros:- Easy to set up (comes with detailed instructions, but if you've ever put up a tent before you will figure it out even without those)- Includes everything you need to make it waterproof and guard against wind and mosquitoes/pests- Plenty of places to hang a light inside- More than enough room for 2 average size adults, (I'm 6' 180lbs  i could have fit 3 times comfortably with an air mattress, thankfully i didn't need to but just so you are aware it's perfect for 2)- Easy to disassemble and pack  (literally takes 1 person about 5 minutes to break down and pack for travel, also comes with a carrying pouch)- Last but not least the price (less than 50 dollars including expedited shipping) In the picture above you can see my friend's tent on the left, that is also a 2 person tent but cost him nearly 500 dollars and what he got for that was a tent that does pack smaller and is lighter, but fitting 2 people in it is not easy, I tried the first night lol, never again)Cons:- I had trouble actually finding one but if i had one it would be the weight, and even that i think could have been attributed to my decision to get a 2 person rather than a 1.  it is heavier than a more expensive tent and you will feel it if you are backpacking, which we were).- One more con, the pouch, nothing wrong with having one but once you unpack the tent good luck getting it back into the included pouch, a good idea, however poorly executedBottom line; if you are looking for a cheap but durable and backpackable tent this is the one, although if you are thinking of saving weight I'd suggest a 1 person, this one will give you a good workout though and I was fine :) (we were backpacking on Isle Royale btw for 4 days so I packed and unpacked and set this up every time we stopped to camp, and had no issues, fantastic build quality for the price and well worth it in my opinion.

  I have camped in this tent two and a half times, and I love it.  I say two and a half, because my third trip in the tent, I was forced out of it in the middle of Tropical Depression Nate up in Big Meadows Campground in Shenandoah National Park this past October (2017).  It was holding its own for most of it, but eventually the rings came lose from the tent stakes and one tent stake came up out of the ground, and I had to flee my humble abode and dive into my parents' van!  I didn't have the stakes driving all the way into the ground, because I wasn't expecting a freaking tropical storm, plus we were in high elevation.  I think it would have held its own if I had driven the stakes all the way down.  As soon as I got out of it, within 5 minutes, the thing turned into a kite and sailed right into my parents' van.  LOL!  The first camping trip in this tent (May 2017), it withstood a severe thunderstorm at Fall Creek Falls, TN, and I stayed dry.  There was a tiny puddle of water around that small zipper hole in the bottom corner, but I didn't have it zipped closed, so that could be why.  The second camping trip (September 2017) at Panther Creek State Park, TN was perfect weather, and the tent was marvelous.  I especially love the little zipper in the bottom corner where you can run an electrical cord through it.  I like being able to hang a camping light in the top of the tent.  During the camping trip with Tropical Depression Nate, my rain fly got ripped pretty badly.  I think I'll be able to patch it.  I hate to throw away a perfectly good tent because I can't buy a replacement rainfly.  This tent is so easy to set up, too.  If you have two people, it goes quickly!  If you set it up alone, it's mildly cumbersome, but easily doable.  A queen-sized air mattress will fit in here, but it takes up ALL the space.  You can store some very small things along the sides, but no suitcases or anything.  Since I'm always in mine alone, I use a twin air mattress, and that leaves plenty of room for stuff and to step in and out of the tent.  I will say that, once again, the tent bag is too small.  I thought I rolled that tent up tight, but not tight enough.  The bag split when I tried to zip it.  I think those little green ties they include might have been helpful to keep the rolled tent from expanding.  But they could make a slightly bigger bag, too.  It's forever a problem with tents.  I have included pictures with the queen-sized and twin-sized air mattresses.

",1.0,Colette T.,"Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2019","









  
  
    
  Ok so pay attention to this before you buy. This tent only has 2 full walls that close. The other 2 sides are full on mesh that have no way to be shut. The rainfly covers them but they remain open at all times. So be fully aware before you buy. Had I realized this I would have never made this purchase, but because I took it camping now I won’t be returning it. I mean seriously think about how limiting this feature is. No cold weather, no dust or sand, no wind, no rain...on and on. Everything will fly into your tent !! This has got to be the most bizarre tent I have ever seen or ever used. I took it out on a trip and it got to 40 overnight, needless to say it was a few very cold nights with only 2 sides to your tent. Just unbelievable ! And the locking pin assembly is ridiculous. Most tents have little pockets that you put the poles into to keep the poles steady and rigid and add stability and strength to the bottom of the tent. This tent is a waste of money

  Great tent! I'm a relatively experienced camper. It took me and a friend about 10 minutes to get it setup...super easy! Loved that even my friend that is about 6'4"" could easily stand up in the center of the tent. After checking mine out he decided to get one too. However, I doubt you can fit 2 queen sized blowup mattresses in there though. We had one double high queen mattress and a single/twin one. Not much room between the mattresses but we had at least 1-2 feet from the end of our mattresses to the door so there was room for our bags and such. liked that there 2 pockets...one on each side to hold your headlamp, phone, or whatever you need to have close by while sleeping.

  The very first time we used this tent was to go camping for Memorial Day weekend. On the first night the zipper got stuck. In order to get it unstuck, force was needed. From that point on the zipper kept malfunctioning. At one point to get out of the tent force was needed to move it and the entire zipper ripped. From then on the zipper was useless and the rest of the tent began to rip. So the tent did not last the first night On Mount Greylock in the Berkshires in Massachusetts. Luckily for us, it was very windy, cold, and raining for the rest of the three day weekend. This tent was poorly made. And I am waiting to hear back from them about a refund.

    The Two ""Windows"" are Better Described as Missing Sides!
  
",2.0,NewsView,"Reviewed in the United States July 20, 2019","









  
  
    
  I am reminded today, upon erecting this tent for the first time, why it is such a gamble to shop for bulky (expensive-to-return) items online. The photo for this Coleman tent is very misleading. You think you are buying a four-sided tent with two windows, a door and a rainfly when, instead, with the rainfly removed it becomes apparent that it is a two wall tent with two of the four sides comprised only of mesh. While this may be ideal for summer ventilation, it's not good for privacy as there is a gap between the rainfly and the bottom edge of the ""windows"". Without that rainfly in place, there is no remaining privacy in the tent to speak of thanks to the ""open sided"" design.My goal was to purchase a tent that could work in emergency situations, such as the aftermath of an earthquake, where people do not feel safe (or their home isn't safe) to reenter. (Alas, I was reminded, after the recent 7.1 and 6.4 July 4 holiday weekend earthquakes here in California, that access to a quick form of shelter is a big part of emergency preparedness.)Where I live, rain is rarely the issue as much as wind. This tent design is likely to take on a lot of blowing dust because two out of the four sides can't be zipped up — Coleman has given no option to close either ""window"". (A drop-down window shade would have been nice even if the only means of securing them was an option to tie them to the sidewalls!). Meanwhile, because the rainfly is a bit too small, wind (and possibly rain) can enter the tent even when it the rainfly is in place. What's more, the presence of the two largely opened sides means that the tent will feel drafty in cooler weather. (For summer camping this may not be a deal breaker but for emergency use — when you can't pick your weather or your season — it could be a *big* problem.)I spent hours shopping for a tent yet was unprepared for what I would receive despite comparing reviews on numerous tents in the four-to-six person size range. In hindsight, I can only speculate that this tent is well reviewed because many reviewers live areas where summer storms are more common than they are here in California — in which case keeping the rainfly on with each and every use is to be expected. Ideally, however, use of the rainfly would have been optional and tent privacy would not have been the worse for having left it off. (A related drawback to this design is that if the rainfly is damaged, the tent will provide no real protection from the elements because there is no way to close the windows from the interior of the tent.) What's more, in the course of my research, I learned that Coleman doesn't offer much in the way of replaceable parts for tents under ~$300 so if the rainfly rips or a pole breaks, it's essentially scrap heap time.If you intend to use this tent only for summer camping and don't mind gaps between the rainfly and the ""windows"" because you camp predominately in isolated (private/secluded) areas, this tent might be for you. However, if you want the option to close up the mesh ""windows"" (sides) to improve privacy or cut down dust and drafts — or you're simply concerned that wind-blown rain may enter the tent from beneath the rainfly — then my suggestion to you is to keep on looking.

    Great Family Tent for Car camping
  
",5.0,Camp4Fun,"Reviewed in the United States September 24, 2017","









  
  
    
  The key to loving the Coleman Sundome 4 person tent is to understand what you are buying.  For around $60.00 you are getting a great tent used for the occasional weekend camping trips with your kids or family.  I purchased 3 of these tents to use for backyard campouts/sleepouts that my kids want to have with their friends.  For the price, they are great for that.  I will also use one of the tents with my son for weekend Cub Scout campouts.  Again, this is the perfect tent to use during a summer/fall weekend campouts where you are not carrying the tent a long distance.What this tent is NOT is a backpacking tent or a tent to be used often or in very cold weather.  I have a Kelty Trail Ridge 3 tent that I use for backpacking or when the weather is supposed to be under 40 degrees F overnight.  It has better poles, is lighter and much smaller (making it about half the weight of the Coleman Sundome 4).Again, this tent is not perfect for all activities.  The fiberglass poles are not suited for heavy winds or very frequent use.  The Rain-fly only covers the top half of the tent meaning in a heavy rain/wind, you are likely to get wet.  The stakes are the cheap tin one that bend after only a few uses.  So if you intention is to campout for several weeks at a time or go backpacking, look elsewhere.  But for 60 bucks, this tent is a great value for the accessional family campout for a long weekend.A few other notes: - This is the same 3-pole Dome tent that Coleman has been making for a long time.  However this Sundome 4 has a few revision I like.  The rainfly has 2 sets of Velcro attachments that connect it to each of the main tent cross poles.  In previous version there was only one attachment per side. - Also, this version has a small loop in the center of the tent to allow you to hang a small light.  I recommend this one as a cheap and lightweight tent light (

  ) - Lastly this version has a small ground vent that allows air to come in from the bottom of the tent to help reduce condensation.  Also, there is a small zippered section in the front left corner that would allow you to bring an extension cord into the tent away from the door (where it is a tripping hazard).If you need a tent to use during the warm nights and for 2-4 days at a time, this is a great inexpensive option.

   This Coleman 3 person tent easily fits 2 people and a kid or a dog or some luggage. It takes 15 minutes to set up and 10 to take down. It folds nicely and fits back into the bag.Based on forum advice I got some nail type tent pegs that were easy to drive into the ground and a rubber mallet. So I have not used the ones that come with the tent, so I had a very easy time setting it up. The poles were already connected by a string and I had to thread them through and clip them on with the attached clips. I also got a tarp for the bottom of the tent based on advice on some reviews posted here, but as I learned it's better to leave the tarp off in rainy weather as water can pool on it and make the tent wet. It would be better to get a tent footprint to put under it. The rain fly is easy to install too and the included cords helps make sure the rain fly is stretched out away from the vents. I had carried a seam sealer but reviews advised not to use it as the tent remains dry.This tent is very well ventilated so it gets cold and airy in the tent in the night even if the temperatures are in 50s. Someone suggested putting a blanket on top of the tent to cover the vents. I did carry a transparent shower curtain for that purpose, but haven't used it so far. This is a great tent for warmer summer evenings and temperatures 55 plus. We've used it in 35 plus temperatures but it's really, really cold and if I did not have an ultra warm 20+ degree sleeping bag I would have frozen. I also carry an extra blanket to put on top of the sleeping bag.The 4 person tent is 9ft by 7ft and it fitted an Intex Queen Mattress and there is a little room on all sides of the tent after fitting in the mattress. If you push it to one side then there is place for all the bags, and my dog. In comparison this 3 person tent  is 7ft X 7 ft and it just fits a queen mattress and no more. It's just enough for 2 adults. In fact, if you inflate the mattress with a car pump it's a bit tough to get it into the tent fully inflated. You may need to almost inflate and finish off once it's inside the tent, but for that you either need to have a separate hand pump or be able to bring the car really close. Of course, you can also use an air pad instead of an air mattress! It's a compact tent so it's easier to warm it up, it's much tougher to stand inside a 3 person tent vs. a 4 person tent.The white walls of the tent reflect light well and there are 2 pockets on the side where you can put a flashlight facing upward to illuminate the whole tent. Another feature I like is was that the bottom of the tent is bathtub style and comes up all around about 3-4 inches which helps keep dirt and water out. It's also advisable to pitch the tent on higher ground slightly sloping downwards so that the water flows downward away from you.The pull down takes very little time and I figured out finally how to roll it back tightly so it fits back inside the bag with all accessories. You just need to make sure you have the door and window unzipped so you can let all the air out and then it rolls up tight.On a recent trip to Crater Lake, OR we took off the rain fly as there was no chance of rain and were able to gaze at the Milky Way, and saw many shooting stars through the rain fly. It was magical. I always think I sleep better in this tent than I do in my own bed. I do carry ear-plugs though as some campers can be late sleepers or some camp sites can have a lot of highway noise.This tent is still going strong after about 10 camping trips or more. I took a time lapse video of my daughter putting up the 4 person tent. With a little help, it's even easier to put up, but she wanted to demonstrate putting it up with no help. It took her about 15 minutes, if there is someone to hold and align the poles it takes less time. The 3 person tent is even easier to put up as the poles are shorter.

  I did A TON of research and read a lot of reviews here on Amazon before finally deciding that this was the tent I was going to purchase.  I was looking for a decently priced, easy to set-up, portable tent for one person.  I wanted to use it for backpacking as well as other campsite adventures.  I just used it for the first time this weekend so I don't have experienced feedback yet I suppose, but thought I would share my findings so far while they're fresh.This tent was great for my needs!  I have camped several times before so I am not new to it, however this was my first time where I would be sleeping in a tent alone, therefore transporting, setting up and taking down the tent myself.  I took it on a up north camping trip in the woods this weekend in northern Michigan with some friends.  Extremely easy to set up!  You really can do it in minutes.  I took my time with it while having a beer though, so maybe 10-20 minutes for me.  Everything you need to set up comes with it.I did not use the rainfly because there was no rain in the forecast but I'm sure it works great, this ""awning"" type is what you want.  I also didn't put it on because I wanted to be able to look up at the stars at night, and let me tell you, that was AMAZING.  Such a clear night and in the woods of northern Michigan you can see an insane amount of stars, along with the Milky Way!  That was just too cool to be able to look at them through my tent ceiling.  The windows of the tent were great too.  I'll see if I can post a photo of my awesome spot in the photos section.Although it did not rain at all (yay!) there was still a ton of moisture from the air/dew.  So much that if you left your sleeping bag out (like my friend did) in the open for an hour or two, it will literally become wet like it did rain.  My sleeping bag that I put in the tent right away still got some moisture on it, but there is nothing you can do about that if there is that much moisture in the air.  May have been better if I closed the windows and put the rainfly on but it really was no big deal at all.As for the actual sleeping space inside, it was totally fine for me.  I am a little over 5'7"" and I would say medium weight, not fat but not skinny.  It was exactly what I was looking for, just enough space for me to sleep and my backpack.  I would not recommend this as a two person tent though unless you are using it with a sig. other and want to cuddle all night and look at the stars=) In my opinion, it was the perfect amount of space for one.  Two adults would probably be tight.  Also, I used one of those self-inflating sleeping pads (regular size) and that fit well in there too.Although my walk to this particular site was not long at all (only 5-10 minutes) I would definitely use it for backpacking.  (That was what I had in mind when I first purchased it.)  You would need a backpacking backpack, it won't fit inside a regular sized backpack.  I'm sure you could strap it on the outside of a regular one though.  Doesn't come with straps but the bag has handles so you could strap it on by putting a rope or whatever through those.Hope that helps!  I tried to think of everything I was looking for when I begun my search.

  Set it up in the back yard with impending week of heavy rain.  Heavy, downpours, wind, for 4 days.  The main problem was getting in and out during a storm.  Due to the small overhang of the rain fly, and the angle of the door, water would come in when entering and exiting.Also the flaps that cover the zipper would blow over and expose the zipper, then rain would come through the zipper.  Mind you this was extreme weather and 4 days of it.  No other leaks except the zipper, held up great and I consider it a great tent for the money.I like how open and airy it is with the rain fly off.  Using it at the beach in a week.

  I wasn't expecting much for the price BUT I used this tent once on clear, flat terrain and by the end of the trip, I noticed a hole in the bottom tarp lining. We made sure to clear any rocks and sticks before putting the tent down, so this was particularly surprising.  There was nothing sharp on the inside of the tend, no shoes, nothing.  Just an air mattress and some clothes, so it definitely wasn't user error.That was what confirmed my decision to return the tent, but it wasn't the only reason.  The tent poles are flimsy and bough out when you first prop it up.  The rain fly, once strapped down, provides a little extra support - the tent poles don't bough out as far once it's on.  With that said, I could easily see myself breaking a pole 1 or 2 uses down the road.  Again, I wasn't expecting much given the price of the tent, but I at least thought it would last the season.  If you go camping with ANY regularity, this is not the tent for you.

  I camp often, think about half of each month in the spring, summer and fall. I've had many tents over the years but this one takes the cake. It's incredibly easy to set up. Two people can have it up in less than 15 minutes once you do it one time, or have used other tents in this style before. The head room is great, I'm 6 feet tall and can stand and move comfortably in this tent which is a blessing. My favourite thing about this tent though...and I mean absolute favourite.. is that it stays DRY. I camped on the coast of Maine for 3 weeks over the summer, where every morning a thick fog would roll through the woods. It also rained frequently. This tent got not a drop of water in it. I've never had a tent that stayed so dry. There's also a vent near the floor of one side which helps keep inside condensation to a minimum. If you've ever camped and ended up with that ""damp blanket"" feeling, this is a great tent to try to eliminate that.

    Make Sure You Seam Seal It!

  Been camping for the past 50 years and have had many tents, both very expensive and cheap and affordable.  If you buy an affordable tent like the Coleman (we love Coleman) be sure to seam seal it and spray with water resistant spray for tents.  That will make it just as waterproof as a really expensive tent for a fraction of the cost.  Also, keep in mind, that no matter if the tent is expensive or affordable, you have to go up in size.  A two person tent will just about fit one person.  I bought this 3 person for me and two small dogs and I know it will be tight if I put in a queen sized blow up bed.  For my grandson and son, I bought the 4 person which I know will be good for just the two of them.  If you take care of your tent it will last a long time.  I have a very, very large old Coleman tent that still works as long as I seam seal it every year and spray it with water resistant spray for tents.  It is harder to put up so I bought this 3 person and the 4 person because we need to get it up easily for a long car trip, otherwise I would use the old Coleman tent.

  Just bought this tent and used for the first time camping this past week. The tent is really spacious and we were able to easily fit a queen size inflatable mattress, an XL dog bed, 2 suitcases and a bunch of bags and still had room to move around. This worked great for 2 adults and a med-large dog plus all of our stuff. It went up in under ten minutes.The tent served us well through the week but the real test came during a late night storm. We only had the corners staked and tied because the weather was nice but we got a surprise storm and even with the sides not tied down, the tent held up. We were able to get the sides staked and tied quickly which was great because it turned into incredibly strong winds, rain, and lighting. Not only did the tent protect us from the wind and rain, it also stayed bone dry through everything due to the great rainfly coverage and bathtub bottom. This tent is made of very high quality materials and we were very happy with the purchase.

  Bought this tent right before a road trip to accommodate my nephew, who cancelled. Plenty of space for 3. I'm used to backpacking tents, and this will sleep 4 just don't expect the space of a hotel 6. We traveled to 3 national parks over spring break 2020, Guadalupe Mountain NP, Carlsbad Cavern NP, and Big Bend NP. These parks are in dessert, so I didn't expect any rain. I was wrong! Apparently rain dances follow you because I haven't seen more fog, misting and rain in my life. This tent stayed bone dry inside. The tie out points for the Navy/Grey model are wrong as my tent lacks corner tie outs. It does have the middle tie out on the short side as pictured. Be aware of this as the directions tell you to point the short side into the wind. Time will tell how important the tie out are. My experience in Badlands NP winds can change direction.An important feature this tent has that caused me to buy it over other tents is the rear window. Most of the tents I saw lack a rear window, which means you lack control of any cross wind. During my trip I kept the tent closed up, but the warmest night we had them open to allow air circulation.ProsKept me dryRear windowConslacks corner tie outs

  Perfect for two people camping over a weekend. We fit a queen air mattress and a Rubbermaid storage bin in it with no problem.A note on performance in TERRIBLE weather. Our first outing with this tent was cut a day short by a severe  thunderstorm in Southern Wisconsin that absolutely soaked the insides of two other tents in our party (one was a Coleman Montana that didn't have its weather shield entirely fitted properly). We pulled up stakes, and water didn't enter the tent until we pulled the weather sheet off.We reset the tent up in our basement for a day to fully dry it out, with no issues and no mildew smell the next time we used it.Two items of concern: I worry about long term durability, as the pressure points where the tent pole clips connect to the tent hint at signs of eventual wear. Also, at a campground with about 50 other campsites visible, at least 5 other people had the exact same tent. :) Still, for the money, a very dependable occasional use tent.

  I felt this tent was worth trying for the nominal $50 I paid for it.  It goes up in less than 10 minutes and perhaps 5 minutes with 2 people and some practice.So far I have only given it a cursory pitch in the living room to check it out on the day it arrived followed by a backyard pitch the following weekend.  It did well in the back yard on a gusty day with winds I would estimate 15-25 mph.  The tent was staked only at the points provided with the tent and it stayed firmly in place though it was completely empty inside.  From the inside it seems to be well ventilated even with the rain fly attached.While up in the back yard for a dry weekend, I did hit all of the seems with a spray on sealer but this tent has yet to encounter a single drop of rain.  We will be taking it on a weekend camping trip in a few weeks and I will try to amend this review once that trip is completed.UPDATE:  On an overnight trip this past weekend, two of us pitched and staked-out this tent in under 10 minutes.  We got a nice thunderstorm in middle of the night complete with gusty winds and heavy rain for about 20 minutes.  This tent did well and did not leak or lose integrity.  During or immediately after the storm I counted 6 campers in our area that left in the middle of the night presumably due to the weather but not us.  This tent was definitely well worth the cost.UPDATE 04/04/19:  I still own this tent and it is still in great working order.  I've never experience a leak anytime using it during rainy weather however, I do re-seal the seems once per year.  I like the durability and ease-of-use enough that I just bought a 2nd Sundome 4-person tent.  We will be using both on our next camping trip.

  Great get up and go tent.  I originally purchased this tent because I had never camped before and thought it would be a once or twice a year thing, at most.  However, I caught camping fever for the first time in my life and have since upgraded on the size of the tent that my wife and I choose to use.About us:  We are 30 and 31 years old.  I am 6'0 tall and 315lbs.  She is 5'7 and well, I hope my wife doesn't read this or I could perhaps lose the ability to write another review, ever again.  She has a few extra lbs. as well.  That's not bad, honey!We fit in this tent comfortably when sitting or laying down on our Queen sized air mattress.  With that being said; if you are over a few feet tall, don't expect to be standing up and changing clothes and or moving around in this tent.  We had just enough space to stash our duffel bags and dirty shoes at the end, and that was all.Pros:Tent is great for easy and fast set up!  No over-reaching involved here!Tent would be great for kids.Tent is a great second tent to own if you don't feel like dragging out the big tent, and or, if you choose to camp with someone who may not have their own.This is just a theory, but the low profile of the tent as well as the overall shape leads me to believe this would be a good all weather tent that would withstand higher winds and minor storms better than towering tents with large walls.Waterproofing:  Tent is small and easy to waterproof.  A single can of waterproofing was more than enough.  Fingers/back won't get tired from holding the trigger and bending over for too long. - Less is more - Save $$$.  Our larger tent took two cans and kinked my back/cramped my hand up pretty bad.Cons:Probably smaller than you will ultimately want, should you camp on a frequent basisOverall:  This is a great tent as a back up tent or a tent for children.  As you can see, I knew the tent was small when I purchased it, so it by no means affected the overall rating.

  I bought this tent as a last minute replacement for a tent I own that had a damaged rainfly. Unfortunately I didn't have the time to do much research into the tent before I bought it. It may be the right tent for someone, but it just didn't work well for us.  The tent has a nice compact storage bag. It is very easy to set up and take down. Plenty of room inside to stand up, store gear, etc. The bad part seemed to be the large ventilation windows on the side. They are huge! Unfortunately they do not have a closeable zip up window flap to cover them. This means that you absolutely need to use the rainfly to keep out rain but also because large gusts of wind would be really bad too. Also you would just feel too exposed not having any way to cover them up. It would be like having glass walls in your house. This leads to the real problem. Where we were camping it got pretty hot during the day and very cold at night. During the day the rainfly seemed to block out most of the breeze keeping it pretty sweltering in the tent. At night I had a family who was miserably cold. I tried to fire up the Mr. Buddy tent heater for a bit to take the bite out of the cold but the huge ventilation holes just were not able to hold in any of the heat. Essentially the tent was no good for when it was either too hot or when it was too cold. If there were a regular zip shut window flap on the sides I would have likely given it 5 stars. Too bad, I really wanted to love this tent but when your kids are crying instead of sleeping you can't really do that.

  This tent is very roomy and I was able to pitch it by myself in less than 30 minutes. That's the positive. Also, for its size it was very inexpensive. On the flipside it's a Coleman tent and other than their iconic gas powered lights (which are now pretty much obsolete) Coleman used to mean quality but now makes cheap sh*t.  I didn't think it would matter because we were doing car camping. The tent arrived with a hole in it. Either give yourself enough time to send the first one back and hope that the second one passed quality control, or spend a little bit more and get something of higher quality.  There is another issue that  bears consideration. The tent has huge windows and without the fly there is great ventilation. However unlike every other tent I've ever seen these ""windows"" cannot be closed. They are simply huge expanses of no-see-em netting. Unless exhibitionism is your thing, the lack of privacy is quite problematic. The only solution is to put up the fly which covers the ""windows"" and provides privacy. The problem is that on a warm summer night the fly covers the windows which were providing ventilation and it will get quite hot. From my point of view this is a significant design flaw and combined with the lack of quality control makes it imperative to look elsewhere.

  The tent seems fine, one major flaw: the tent did not come with poles. I unfortunately didn't check for this after buying and we didn't go camping until this fall so too late to return or complain. I also didn't double check before we actually went camping and had take an hour+ driving out of our short camping trip to buy a new tent from another store. I wish I would have checked before, obviously not my smartest move, but I wasn't expecting such a huge problem. Tent with no poles basically = no tent and out of $50+. The expansion area on the bottom was also already ripped open so I wonder if maybe someone had opened and returned it and they didn't check it before sending it out?It looked fine on the floor and I didn't notice any other things missing. Tent was there, stakes were there, so we're 2/3. Moral of the story, check your tent after you buy and definitely before you go camping! I would love a tent that I could actually use.

  Background: car camping trip in mid October. I Set up the 2 person tent around 12 noon on Saturday and took it down around 11 am on Sunday. It was a one night car camping trip in a Shenandoah Mountains camp ground. Temperature was 40-65 the whole time. Here’s my experience:Rain: it was wet the most of the time I was there. I would say we had about three hours or zero rain. It was drizzling with a mix of full downpour. Water did begin to get into the tent around 8 am on Sunday. There was a thin layer of water on the walls of the tent. Water would also drip down from the seams and zippers. If it was a 2 day trip I believe water would have ruined the trip. I would not recommend this for camping in the rain. No water entered from the bottom!Wind: we had light winds and could feel the wind get under the tents cover. This dropped the temperature a bit. The top of this tent is mostly mesh and the “rain cover” did little to keep the wind out. If the rain cover was larger and would reach further down the tent it would have helped greatly. I ended up putting an outdoor tarp between the tent and the rain cover to cover the mesh roof. This helped the heat from escaping, helped keep wind out, and added a bit of waterproof-ness.Set up was easy with two people.Interior space: two people slept well. Comfortable to sleep in and some space for gear, blankets and backpack of clothes. Tent was Not tall enough to stand in. Basically it was “good enough” and nothing more.Overall, I’m going to try to waterproof the seams and walls and rain fly. I will try using it again. I am a bit upset it was not waterproof. That and the wind were the biggest issues. Probably will be a good tent for a warm and dry day. Would not recommend for cold windy rainy days.

    Too big for windy weather

  For camping out of a vehicle, the tent packs up nicely.  The set up, with one person, is very easy.  This tent is also roomy.  Additionally, the floor to this tent comes up a few inches off the ground before joining to the walls.  This helps to ensure the seams are above the ground, preventing water from coming through the seams.  That is about where the the good points stop.I set this tent up, alone, in about 15mph winds while out on a hunting trip.  I managed to set the tent up solo, so no complaints.  Now, keep in mind, I am in Southern Arizona with ground harder than concrete.  After set up, I properly staked the tent, and set up the rain fly.  During the night, the winds kicked up in excess of 20mph. At first, one corner came unstaked due to the wind.  This tent is like a parachute in the wind, by the way.  I restaked the corner at about midnight.  A little later, another corner came unstaked, again due to the high winds.  Again, I restaked the corner.  Wouldn't you know it? Less than an hour later, both corners (the front corners) came unstaked and the front of the tent lifted up due to the high winds and enormous size of this tent.  I found myself (6'3"", 240lbs) inside this tent trying to keep it from blowing away with the door completely above my head; It was a disaster of a night to say the least.  I ended up throwing this tent in my Jeep and sleeping in the Jeep for the night.  For the rest of the hunt, I slept in my two person North Face tent, which is made to handle high winds and adverse weather.Now, if you are camping from a vehicle in good weather, this is your tent. If the winds pick up, you're in for a bad night.  This tent is too big and not secure enough to be in windy weather.  I will say that I have not been in this tent in the rain.  However, I am still bringing this tent on my next hunt in a few weeks.  I will be in Northern Arizona surrounded by trees, which help to block wind. Nevertheless, based on my last experience, I am bringing my North Face Tent in the even this tent does not hold up to the weather up north.  I will update this review if needed.The reason I went with this tent, even though I own a great two person North Face, is the size.  When I am out hunting for a week at a time and I have my vehicle near by, I like to bring an air-mattress and have room to actually stand up and move around.  Having a central place to camp is great for big tents like this Coleman. If you can set up a tent in one spot for a few days, a big tent is a welcoming comfort.

We accidentally setup right in the center of a red ant burrow (did notice till we took the tent down two days later) and did not get infested with ants, so it was sealed up nice and tight. The dark one was nice because it absorbed a little more of the morning light than the white and green tent would have. The storage pockets on the side were really nice for keeping essentials like water and flashlight handy and easy to find. Overall great tent and great value.

All the bungie cords in the rods are broken.  Coleman obviously found another made in china contractor to increase profit margins and take a crap on quality.  Every aspect of this tent is lighter, cheaper and just plain tacky. I would expect this quality from the dollar general store, not coleman. When compared side by side with the same model but older version the rods are 20% thinner, the connection sleeves are markedly thinner metal, and the rods are now about 5 inches shorter.  If you are looking at this tent because you have the older version of this model and wanted another quality tent don't be a fool like I was, STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!

    Camping/Backpacking Tent on a College Budget
  
",5.0,Rachel Draz,"Reviewed in the United States June 8, 2015","









  
  
    
  After years of camping in a collective tent with my family (about 4-5) all crammed in once space, it was time to buy a smaller tent for myself and possibly a partner. Did my research, and living on a college budget, I knew I couldn't afford to drop $300+ on a nice backpacking tent. At least not right away. However, I finally managed to put it through it's paces this weekend, and I'll admit, it's a pretty decent product, with only a few cons.First, the travel bag it comes in is not meant for backpacking. At all. This is standard Walmart-esk canvas bag that is heavy, cumbersome, and square. However I've had absolutely no problems getting the tent in and out of the bag. The tent isn't an odd shape, and it rolls up really well. However, if you're going to go backpacking, you'll need to buy a separate bag.Second, assembly is a dream! I could probably do it with my eyes closed if I had to. Two poles, same length, lightweight and pretty sturdy. Had no problems getting it set-up, in fact I had my partner set it up (with supervision) who had never set up a tent before. The only thing of note is that the rain tarp (or whatever you locally call it) has a pole that you slip in horizontally across the bow of the tent that can be tricky. More simply put, the pole extends from back to front with only a little velcro pouch to hold it in, thus it is easily missed the first time you try and set it up. Once you know where it is, it's easy.Third, the room. While my partner and I fit rather well with little to no effort in putting pads, blankets, and sleeping bags in, I will note that it was a tight fit. At least, our packs did not fit easily inside. In fact they pretty much didn't, but it was slated to rain rather hard that night, so it was our only option. To be fair, we had an ungodly amount of padding and blankets we were laying on, and ultimately would probably had enough room for at least one pack if we hadn't had so much padding (had to use old fashioned couch-like cushions at the time). Overall definitely roomy enough for one person and their gear+, but a tight fit for two grown adults and their gear.Fourth, and possibly the most important but also easily fixable: It leaked. Not gratuitously, but enough to leave just a little water on the bottom of the pads. However, this was after a night of *very* heavy rainfall and wind. I was curious to see if the factory seal would be enough to make it waterproof, and I can't say I'm surprised that it didn't. However, I will be resealing it myself, which is easy enough for people to do. So don't think too poorly of it's water abilities.Another note: it doesn't come with a footprint, so I would invest in one. In fact, screw the traditional heavy canvas, and invest in some Tyvek 1443R Kitemaking Material. It's SUPER lightweight (it's kitemaking material), waterproof, and comes recommended by pretty much every backpacker out there. Worked like a charm, and it so thin and lightweight that it fits in the crappy square tent bag with everything else.All in all, this is a damn good tent for the price, and you should probably buy it.

  I went camping at Gennie Springs in Florida for the first time this past weekend. I bought this tent a couple weeks prior to ensure I had everything ready to go. It arrived within 2 days thanks to amazon prime. Once it arrived I set it up in my living room to see if it had any defects. Non were detected. I commend this tent for it's ease of setup. I was able to set it up by myself in under 3 minutes. When I set it up at the camp site with the help of my girlfriend it took us barely a couple minutes. The tent itself is just big enough to fit a 2 person (queen) inflatable mattress from walmart. However, you have to make sure to inflate the mattress inside as it will not fit through the door fully inflated - learned this the hard way. The tent kept the water out at night. It was a nice weekend with the lows around 68; there was great ventialation in the tent to the point where I had to cover myself extra well in the middle of the night as it was getting chilly. Overall I think this tent is excellent for two people and especially for the price point. A tent of similar size was being sold at walmart but marketed as a 4 person tent - talk about being cramped. Highly recommend.

  We’ve owned the sundown 6 for 2 years and in that time, we have camped for over 70 nights in a variety of conditions.  Over one summer alone, we travelled for 6 weeks across 27 states and 2 provinces, camping the entire way.Here are the pros and cons we discovered along the way.1. It held up through some massive rain storms.  For the record, we always spray our tents, and especially the seams, with silicone at the start of a camping season.  Additionally, we managed to squeeze 2 queen sized air mattresses into the tent, and then shared that space between 5 people.  We just fit in width, but it was naturally difficult to keep all blankets, pillows and even the corner of the mattress out of contact with the side wall.  Experienced campers know that contact=leaks in a rain.  Despite these constraints, the tent kept us dry throughout some intense and long rains, with no more than 1/4 cup worth of water pooling in a corner where we have contact issues.  In fact, our sundown 4 kept my husband and son dry on a group trip where many others had to bail because their expensive tents were leaking extensively.2. It sets up and take down fairly easily.  If at least two corners of the tent are staked before lifting the poles, a single person can set it up.  On our road trip we were constantly setting up and taking down our tent, and it didn’t become cumbersome at all.3. In hot climates the tent is very airy, however the mesh roof makes for cold nights when sleeping in cold environments (aka Yellowstone in July).4 I do not like how low the mesh roof comes down on two sides of the tent.  If the rain fly is staked our tightly, then neighbors from the side can see in (a little bit) through the mesh.  Think of the small gap between rainfly and mesh as similar to an awkwardly placed gap in a public bathroom stall door.  One can’t see much—but it’s enough to make a person standing or sitting to get changed a little uncomfortable.  That means that I had to lay down to get changed.  It was also enough for my pesky son to threaten his sister that he might peek in...siblings.5. The tent has held up in some fairly windy weather.  However, all guys lines do attach to the rain fly, so it can make stargazing in windy weather difficult.  We opted to sleep sans rain fly in Badlands National Park.  The wind battered the sides of the tent, which simultaneously battered me!  If you like to sleep under the stars, be prepared to make your own guy lines.6.  It actually folds into the bag...a couple half folds and a triple fold before rolling (fold it right and there is even a little room to spare).7. It has held up under a lot of activity without replacing any parts.  However, year 3 ( which might be equivalent to year 10 for once-a-year campers) and the zipper is starting to split at the top.  Not bad for the price of the tent.We plan to camp around the NW this summer for another 6 weeks and have decided to go with a larger 10x14 tent to actually fit those 2 queen mattresses.  But we have stashed this tent under the floor in our van just in case.  Many National Park sites can’t guarantee more than a 12x12 pad, and this tent folds up small enough to be a back-up.  With a 10x10 footprint, it can go anywhere.

    Easy Set-Up, Easy Pack-Up, Stayed Dry Despite Mother Nature
  
",5.0,JimRhino,"Reviewed in the United States March 26, 2018","









  
  
    
  Easy to set-up, easy to pack-up. I haven't tent camped in over 20 years but found this tent to be great for getting back into the swing of things. We camped in Northern Idaho, in March, but were hit with a huge combo of weather; rain, sleet, snow, graupel, 20+mph wind gusts coming off Lake Coeur d'Alene, daytime temps in the upper 30's (f) and low 40's (f), nighttime temps getting down to around 20*F, and the tent handled it all like a champ.If you're going to do very much cold weather camping, I would suggest another tent, because 50% of the tent's dome is mesh/netting with no way to seal from the wind. It does have a rain fly that helped, but when guided out created a funnel for the wind to breeze right through the tent.Despite Mother Nature throwing the book at us, this tent stayed completely dry, other than the water than got in while setting it up in the rain. I am impressed with this tent and look forward to a lot of mild to warm weather camping with it.

  I bought this tent to take on my first camping trip in years (in essence, I'm a ""beginning-level"" camper at best). That being said, this product was incredibly easy to set up, tear down, and fit back into its original bag. I did not test it in rainy conditions, but it seems to be made of quality material and I liked the cover. The price was hard to beat, and it was shipped to me almost immediately after I ordered. Very impressed!

  This tent is perfect and everything I could have wanted for a camping trip.  The interior mesh pockets are great for holding flashlights or your phone.  The rain fly comes down a bit low in the front, but I guess you'd want that if it was actually raining!  Mine also came with a rectangular piece of tarp like material and I couldn't figure out what it was for and then it hit me...It's a tent doormat!  How awesome is that?!  It even has a loop on each side for staking it into the ground so it doesn't move or blow away and they give you enough stakes to do it.  The set up was a snap and take down was easy too.  The bag it comes in expands (pull on a tab once you remove the box) so that you don't have to try to stuff all the materials back in the box, you can put it directly in the bag with room to spare.  It made things so much easier.  I haven't tried it in the rain yet, so when I do, I'll update my review.

    Quality Concerns
  
",3.0,Clifford,"Reviewed in the United States June 7, 2018","









  
  
    
  We bought this tent and immediately went camping the next weekend. The setup was easy and tent interior was fine.  Our problem came when we were taking the tent down and the elastic in both set of poles snapped.  These poles can be used without the elastic, but it is certainly more convenient to have the poles linked.  I was a little frustrated to have the product break so soon after purchase but I figured I would at least try contacting customer service to see what could be done.  I received no reply for a week and when I did they asked for my tent model and said they would sent new poles.  Several days later I received three tent pole repair kits for a different tent model than mine.  I was able to use the elastic out of the kits to repair my poles, but it was a bit of a hassle.  Now I have three kits full of poles and pieces that don't match my tent.In conclusion, it's concerning that my tent poles would break after one use.  It was also concerning that instead of sending me new poles (or just elastic band) I got the wrong kits.  This is a cheap tent, so I was expecting some long term quality issues, I just figured it wouldn't be a problem so soon.  If I was to do it again I would probably just spend more and get a better tent.

    Poor Quality Stretch Cording Within Poles
  
",1.0,stassy,"Reviewed in the United States December 14, 2019","









  
  
    
  VERY disappointed. I purchased this tent for a two week summer camping vacation in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Although it served me well for the two weeks, upon taking it down, the stretch cording inside one set of the main structure’s poles broke totally unexpectedly. Upon inspecting the cord, it was obvious that it is very poor quality. For the cording to rip in half is disappointing. I had only assembled, and disassembled, twice: the first time, to practice setting it up (and seam seal it,)  and, the second time to actually use it.Looking to see if I could get a refund from this shop, it was “beyond 30 days” since my purchase (it was 2 months, as  I had purchased it a month earlier than my trip so a refund could not be given. What a waste of money. I really am disappointed in the quality of this tent’s stretch cord (pole’s interior structure.)I should have listened to the reviews regarding this flaw, so it is really my own fault. If you buy this tent and the structure breaks, you’ve been forewarned. I can’t even buy replacement parts as I’ve called everywhere! I have to purchase cording and re-cord this set of poles back together. I wouldn’t even want to chance it because I’m assuming that other stretch cords might just snap unexpectedly. Not worth redoing them all.Don’t waste your money. If it had been a bad coastal storm, (as I have encountered many times camping on the beach coast in the last 20 years,) there is a good chance that that tent would’ve snapped and my family and I would’ve been left basically shelterless. Not cool. Pass this one by.

    A comfortable, sturdy setup that got me through a blizzard and the worst week of my life. What more could I possibly ask of it?
  
",5.0,MH,"Reviewed in the United States June 12, 2018","









  
  
    
  This tent is very easy to set up (I did it practically by myself). There are instructions on the bag, but I didn't find them necessary at all. Pretty straightforward setup, really. It holds up well. I spent a week in this tent through a few days' long blizzard. Multiple of my teammates' tents collapsed under the snow or broke and let in snow/water that soaked everyone's gear, but mine stayed standing the whole time! The floor does in fact stay dry, as does the rest of the tent- the rainfly worked quite well, even when weighted down with snow. The pockets on the walls are useful for storing small items. The small ring on the ceiling of the tent worked nicely for hanging a lantern from as well. The stakes that the tent came with are your usual cheap ones, so I bought the MSR stakes to make up for it. I still use the stakes that came with the tent for secondary things like the rainfly and tarp, though, so they're still useful. The tent is quite spacious, although that may have been because I was alone in the tent. Taking the tent down was very easy as well; I was able to do it alone despite having sustained a concussion less than 24 hours before I left the campsite, so being easy to work with even with a non-functioning brain was a major plus.I'm doing this trip again every year for the next three years, ideally with significantly less concussions or blizzards. Hopefully the tent continues to exceed my expectations every year!(Will update this review after next year's trip...)

  This is such a poorly made product. It arrived in time for my camping trip and I checked to make sure that all of the components were include (poles, spikes, etc.) Unfortunately what I did not check was that the tent was actually sewn together and that the pole inserts were attached to the tent. Well they were not! Two were dangling from the tent by a single piece of frayed thread which made the tent useless.... couldn't even manage a ""workaround"" to get through the night since I was on a beach with some wind and anything would have been too flimsy.  For me this is the final straw with Coleman since I have noticed a decline in the past several years. I think one is better of with ""Ozark Trails"" from Walmart. Totally ruined a weekend which had to be carefully planned due to COVID 19. Would love to give negative stars if possible.

    Great for General Camping
  
",5.0,Free88Top Contributor: Camping,"Reviewed in the United States December 31, 2016","









  
  
    
  Great tent for general camping.  Given the quality of the materials and finished product, this is a great value.First use was in 50 degree F and 50% humidity.  The tent handled those conditions no problem.  The air flow can be controlled somewhat and felt just right without tying anything closed or otherwise trying to stop the natural air flow within the tent.  Obviously, the tent itself has no insulation, but the temperature inside was very comfortable given the above mentioned conditions.  I can see going down another 10-20 degrees F and being totally fine with this tent and standard sleeping bags.  Below that you will probably need additional tarps to put over it to block air flow and warmer than standard sleeping bags.I cannot attest to the rain resistance of the tent, however, it looks like it will handle light to medium showers with relative ease.  The floor is tarp material with a fair amount of water resistance, and makes up the lower 4-6 inches of the walls.  From there up is standard tent material you would find on many other tents at this price point.  The mesh makes up a great deal of the upper portion of the tent, and all of that is covered by the rain fly when it is on.  The rain fly itself is the same material as the tent walls.  Air flows between the rain fly and the mesh sections.  You can close that up to some degree to control the air flow.  Additionally, there is a vent on the back wall near the floor, but high enough to not be a splashing water during rain problem.  There is also a very tiny zippered opening on the front wall to bring in an extension cord.  There are also two zippered, large windows.  One on the back wall, one on the door itself.  The D door is well thought out, and features a flap to keep rain out on the lower half.Setup is a breeze, even for the novice.  It is very intuitive and straightforward.  You have three poles to assemble, two for the tent and one for the rain fly.  Slide them through, clip, and plug in at the ends.  Thats pretty much it.  There are some little velcro straps here and there to further secure the poles to the tent and rain fly.  Put the third pole in the rain fly and then attached to the tent with the straps with clips.  Tie down as needed, and you are done.  There is also a floor mat for the entrance in the bag.  This tent will stand on its own and does not absolutely need to be staked or tied to something.  Its optional.  Recommend you buy some additional parachute cord and maybe some heavier-duty stakes, as is pretty much always the case with every single tent on the market.Pack up is also a breeze.  With minimal effort I was able to get it all in the box it came in and then into the carry bag.  You do not have to use that box, and you can discard it and just use the carry bag.  I like the squarish dimensions, so I kept the box.  Otherwise, it will be more of a gym bag when packed.  At any rate, plenty of room in there for additional stakes, parachute cord.  If you manage to pack it tight, you could even fit a floor tarp in there (not included).4 people is actually possible with this tent, but not with gear.  Maybe some backpacks, but thats about it.  You can fit two full size air mattresses, or a queen plus a twin.  It will be tight either way, and double stack air mattress will make it even tougher.  But, it is possible.  A full plus twin is more realistic, and there will be some room for gear.  We just use a full and have tons of room for gear, coolers, etc.Overall, fantastic tent at this price.  Love the navy color scheme, and worth the extra couple bucks.  I would not call this a hiking tent, as it weighs over 10 pounds.  More if you buy heavier stakes, additional floor tarp, etc.  But, you could make it work for hiking if you share the loads.  For the occasional camper, this is perfect.

  I really didn't expect much for a tent this inexpensive. Wow was I surprised! I bought it for a one-off camping trip so I didn't want to spend a lot. This tent survived the ultimate test: A New Mexico mountain monsoon storm with 40 mph winds and driving rain. The tent did not leak one drop even though I could see a literal stream flowing under it at the height of the storm which lasted about 2 hours. Since I had a lot of time to gaze up into it and look at every detail while waiting out the storm, I was quite impressed by the way it was designed with reinforcement at tension points and how well sewn it was. Also, the way it's designed with a mesh top and rain fly over that means condensation was not a problem.It says it's a 4 person tent…uh, not really. My queen size air mattress took up nearly the whole tent. Maybe 4 small children…It's very easy to set up and take down and Coleman sewed the directions into the carrying bag so they will never be lost.Super impressed with this high quality tent at a fantastic price.

  UPDATE: Finally took the tent out on a 2 night trip to lake Kissimmee State Park, in FL. I can say the tent ventilation was good. It was hot and humid with a bit of a breeze. The breeze was definitely welcome when in the tent! I also used a fan in the tent, just to keep some cool air flowing overnight.The second day out, we had heavy thunderstorms come through. We had 3 storms that day and rain throughout the night. The tent was dry and never leaked. I completely forgot about the zipper in the corner for running power through, since I never expect to use it, and it never leaked in all that rain. If you're familiar with Florida's Hurricane season, you understand the storms I went through!Overall I recommend this tent. It may be heavier than the more expensive tents, but it's solid!I set this tent up in my backyard to test it out and make sure I liked it. It does have some weight to it, but I'm a newbie to camping, so I can't compare it to anything. I can say, I am happily surprised with the quality of the tent. It was bigger than I thought it would be and roomy on the inside. I feel like maybe I would have been happier with a 2 person tent, but I guess I can stretch out more now!1) From the start, the carrying bag is good quality. It has a tear away at the bottom, to expand the bag, if needed. Instructions are stitched into the bags interior!2) I think I'll upgrade the poles to aluminum eventually. The poles that come with it are just metal and plastic pieces.3) The tent comes with a foot pad to place in front of the door, which I think is a nice touch!4) the material of the tent and rain fly seems like a good quality, especially for the price.5) the rain fly is reinforced where the poles go into it and seems well stitched as well.6) The zipper seems like good quality. I had no issues with it at all.7) It fit back into it's packaging without an issue. I didn't get it perfect, but I didn't have to expand the bag.

  I've had a lot of experience with tents and this one is fantastic. I don't do as much camping lately, but I needed to replace an old tent with one that would fit my husband and I, and our two young girls. I also wanted them to be able to play in it in the back yard. We've had a very stormy summer in western Pennsylvania with record rains. This tent stayed up thru two giant thunderstorms dumping record rain fall. After the first storm it was 100% dry inside! I checked thoroughly. The second let a little water in, possibly blowing up under the rain fly, and as anyone who has camped in a tent before knows, some of that you can't avoid.The tent has really nice interior windows/zipper blinds -a must for me, I like to be able to see out and control privacy and ventilation without taking the rain fly on and off. It also has a lower vent in the back as part of the rain fly. Nice and private allowing for ventilation. The front also has one of those power ports! I haven't used them too much but I feel like those would be so fun and useful! Especially if camping during a road trip at KOA's or something. You're able to run an extension cord into the tent without tripping over it in the door or allowing water in during rain. It has two nice tent pockets but only one hook from the peak of the ceiling. That's kind of a bummer, but you could easily sew an extra hook on and attach hanging cup holders, pockets, or those new ""entertainment lofts"" to hold iPads or tablets to watch movies on. I think those are a great and fun idea so the lack of extra hooks, lofts and pockets is the only downside.Overall it was way bigger and roomier than expected. I'm 5'4"" and could almost stand up inside. Plenty of room for me and my girls or a slumber party or a road trip and duffle bags and gear! Whatever!

  I am not much of a camper (or at all really) but I am very pleased with purchasing this tent for a school camp out trip. Was very easy to set up. I did a trial run at home before leaving to check parts and work out ""kinks"" in my process. Took me about 30 minutes the first time to put up, when I set it up at camp took about 15. Based on other reviews, I did do a coating of the water proofing spray on the seams, however we didn't have rain on our trip so not sure if that was necessary or useful. Only 1 negative (note 4 instead of 5 star) the support poles for the canopy had broken elastic upon arrival, however I was able to just cut the elastic (to get it out of the way) and put the pole pieces together and it worked like a champ. Even though it worked, I feel I have to knock 1 star off for having ""broken"" pieces on a brand new item. The tent comes with information to contact for replacement parts, but I haven't gotten to that part yet #momlife :). If i do I will update my review with how that process went. I like the bag it comes in - there is a pull strip that you can remove that makes the bag open a bit further for easier re-packing I appreciated that detail.

I don't use one then wait a year, I use them almost monthly, and they tend to get a bit abused due to the places I go, and mode of transportation I use.1.

Like most tents, sides will get damp in super cold weather, and ice forms and makes it moist, but overall, the bowl style bottom repels water nicely, and if using a decent ground cover, you won't get wet.I couldn't recommend this tent more.

  I bought the 4-person version of this tent, with the intention of using it for solo or pair camping comfortably while having loads of extra room for gear. I'm tall, and a lot of smaller tents are made for people under 6 feet. This tent performed amazingly -- it can fit a queen mattress with plenty of room to spare for gear. I didn't do any waterproofing ahead of time, but even with a good amount of rain on its first weekend trip, it didn't leak at all. The tall ""tarp skirt"" at the bottom is a nice bonus compared to other tents I've used in the past, which could leech water through the thin fabric if wet grass was touching the sides or if rain was heavy enough. Setup and tear-down was very easy even for one user, though definitely would be even easier with two.This tent kept me perfectly comfortable in 40 degree overnight temps. However there are two big vents and one floor vent that can't be closed up (just staked down as close as possible to the tent), so I'm not sure how comfortable this would be in colder temps with strong winds. On the plus side, this should be amazingly comfortable in hot summers if you can position it with even a slight cross-breeze.Now for the downside: one of the straps which clips the tent wall to the poles started to rip at the seam when I tried to connect it. I left that strap unconnected and I still had no leak issue at all. I'll be contacting Coleman since this tent is less than a month old, but I suspect that with some Seam Grip, a half an hour of stitching, and some Tenacious Tape, I'd still get at least a decade of service from this tent.

  Update:  My two kids and I used this tent for a Scout camp this past weekend.  The first night was torrential rains and heavy winds for at least 6 hours.  I sat awake wondering when the rain would start getting into the tent, waiting for my rain cover to blow off or for water to start accumulating.  In the morning our tent was in one piece and completely dry inside.  I didn't use a ground cover or tarp.  Just the tent.  We had not one drop of water in our tent.  The other families that were in tents all had rain in their tents.  One family had at least an inch of water.  This tent was fantastic and I was so happy to wake up in a dry tent.  Please note I did buy and use better tent stakes, I upgraded from the stakes that were included.  I would highly recommend better tent stakes.  But with better tent stakes I highly recommend this tent if you think you are going to be in rainy conditions.I researched a lot of tents prior to purchase.  I needed something easy to set up on my own.  I wanted a tent that could withstand heavy rain.  I also wanted a tent that could comfortably sleep 4 (2 Kids 2 adults).  This tent met all these requirements.  I was able to set up almost the entire tent on my own and quickly.  The tent itself was no problem but I’m only 5’2” so struggled with the rainfly but I was able to get it with help from my 7 year old.  The size of this tent is perfect.  I used it with just one queen air mattress and there was so much room.  I was able to set up a little table (just a bin)and play mat inside the tent for my kids. On night 2 it downpoured and we were kept completely dry.  I could easily stand up in the tent.  But again I’m fairly short.This would be an excellent tent for warm weather camping.  I would not use for cold weather.  I live in Minnesota and took this tent camping this past weekend.  I thought I’d be ok temp wise. The temperature both nights dropped to 36 degrees and due to all the ventilation the tent got pretty cold. However this was my error in using this tent in cold weather.  The tent itself is great.  Perfect for warm weather. I just would caution about using in colder temps.  I look forward to using this spring and summer!

We thought we'd have a difficult time setting it up since neither one of us had ever set up a tent, but it literally took like 5 minutes, and the directions are easy to follow. It rained pretty hard the first night we were out there, and I wasn't sure if the tent would actually keep us dry, but it shockingly did. This is such good value for the price, is a perfect size for two people to sleep comfortably, and the little inside hanging pockets are a nice touch, we were able to store flashlights, wipes, and our phones in a nice spot. The ONLY thing I disliked about this tent was that the zipper kind of gets caught in the fabric when you're trying to close the tent, but that's such a minor issue and probably happens with lots of tents. I would highly recommend this.

    Excellent tent for backyard or car-camping
  
",5.0,Melisa Michaels,"Reviewed in the United States February 17, 2019","









  
  
    
  It's probably too heavy for a backpacking camper, but this little tent is perfect for my needs, since I don't have to carry it far. It sets up and comes down very easily -- I'm an out-of-shape old woman and I did it by myself. It exactly fits my ""full""-sized futon mattress, which means that yes, it will fit two people ... but they'd better be pretty friendly.This tent has withstood snow, sleet, and  rain without a leak. I did have to poke at the rain fly before I got up on the morning after a sleety ""winter mix"" of precipitation. The fly was heavy with icy snow that would have all gone down my back (and probably into the tent door as well!) if I hadn't reached out through the top of the door only, to jiggle the roof and make that stuff fall before I got out.There is a small risk of rain getting inside when you enter or exit during a storm, as the fly doesn't protect the bottom of the door, and if the door itself falls inward (as it tends to do), it will drip all over inside. But that's easily avoided when you know the risk, and it's really the only problem I've had with this tent.No condensation inside. No leaks. On clear nights I've slept without the rain fly, so I could see the stars through the generous screened areas. The rain fly is easy to remove and replace, though I wouldn't want to have to replace it in a big quick hurry if it started raining during the night, so I do check the weather forecast before I take it off.Both of the ""windows"" that are less well covered by the rain fly have zip-up covers in case it's raining sideways (or, I suppose, if the wind is just too much inside). There's a nice vent at the back of the tent near the floor, so there's excellent air exchange inside even when there's little or no wind.Overall I'm completely satisfied with this tent and recommend it to anyone who just wants a good tent and doesn't need it to be extremely light-weight.

    6 person tent: Poor design, Questionable quality, You get what you paid for…
  
",2.0,A.I.,"Reviewed in the United States August 8, 2020","









  
  
    
  We got this 6-person tent from Amazon and used it for a 3-day camping trip in the beginning of August. During our stay, a short-lived period of chilly weather dropped the night temperatures into the mid-40s, with light occasional drizzling rain through the day. Then it got hot again. This way, we could test the tent in different summer weather conditions.  Setting up the tent was easy. It has a “classic” 3-pole design: two poles go at 90 degrees to each other across the tent, and one shorter pole supports the rain fly. Assembly instructions are printed on a cloth-like “sheet” sawn to the carrying bag. The instructions are not super clear, so it may take a few minutes to figure out where the poles go through, but ultimately, it is not a difficult task. The 6-person tent requires two people to set up. Set up time can easily be 10 minutes or less.  The poles are quite long, so one needs a fair amount of room around the tent for the assembly.  The tent is quite roomy. I am 6’3” and I can almost stand in the middle. The size of a 6 person tent is great for car camping of 3 people, with good amount of room between the sleeping bags to store some clothes. I cannot judge how well 6 people can fit in it, although I have strong doubts that it can be comfortable.The tent is poorly equipped when it comes to organization of your items. There are two tiny pockets on the sides (am I the only one who thinks that it is not enough for a tent rated for up to 6 people?) and a hook at the top to attach an LED lantern. There is a mesh window in the door, which you can close or open, and a similar size window across the door, which also can be opened and closed for ventilation. Zipper in the door worked well through the 3 days of use.  Ventilation of this tent (or rather lack of adjustability of ventilation) turned out to be a significant problem. A good tent allows one to adjust it as one pleases – close it on cold nights to keep the tent warm, or open it up to see the stars and let air and breeze in. This is way outside the range available with this tent, at least, in public areas. To begin with, two side walls, starting from the knee level to the top, are see-through mesh. If you are on a public campground and decide to remove the fly on a warm clear night, it will be a joke of the privacy – the whole campground will see you in the tent and everything that you store in the tent. I attached a picture to illustrate this point. The rain fly covers the mesh, but barely. It overhangs it by 1-2 inches, and there is a 2-3 inches gap between the fly and the mesh. In addition to that, the fly does not overlap much with the sides of the tent on the front and back, so air can flow into the tent not only from the sides through the gap between the sides of the tent and the fly, but also through the gap between the fly and the sides of the tent. Consequently, you would feel any breeze, no matter from which direction it comes from, in your tent. To add to it, there is a vent in the bottom of the back panel, right next to the head of the person sleeping in the middle, which cannot be zipped.  This may all be welcome and nice features on a warm steamy night (except the fact that there is absolutely no way how one would remove the fly as it totally sacrifices any privacy, unless you camp in the woods with no other people around). However, on a relatively chilly summer night my wife was freezing, wrapped towels around her head, and was blaming me for picking a bad tent. [Just for the record, we camp every summer, but until now, used a smaller (4-person), more advanced tent from a different brand. Never had any of problems described above!]  If this were the only issue with this tent, I would say it is a fine tent for camping during warm days, for those nights when one can sleep in a hammock. It would be a fine one-season tent. But there is more issues with it.The fly is supported by a pole which runs along the length of the tent, from front to back. It ends more or less at my eyes level, in the 6-person tent. Every time I would get into the tent, I had a feeling that this pole is going to poke me in the eye.  The quality of the tent failed to impress. Sewing around one of the hooks which attaches tent to the poles has almost failed completely after a single trip. Floor of the tent started showing signs of tear (white spots, with coating scraped off), even though we put tarp under the tent and were not walking in shoes inside – and this is after just 3 days! By the way, the cheapest tarp from Harbor Freight Tools which was under the tent showed much better durability and was in pristine condition after 3 nights. I was wondering, how cheap is the floor material in this tent, if the lowest end and cheapest tarp that I know of turned out to be order of magnitude better quality?  My only explanation how such poorly designed and poorly made tent could get such good ratings on Amazon is that perhaps a 2 or 4 person version has different proportions between the sizes of mesh walls and sold walls, maybe it has a larger fly, and maybe smaller tents lack that non-closeable vent by the floor, which we had to close with another piece of tarp and had to put a carton from camp oven on top of it, to keep it shut during the last night. My review applies only to 6 person tent.  The bottom line is, it may seem to be a good deal, but you get what you paid for.

    Not really big enough for a queen sized air mattress
  
",3.0,Courtney B.,"Reviewed in the United States June 4, 2018","









  
  
    
  I bought this to replace my previous tent and saw it said in the description ""fits a queen size mattress."" What they actually mean is that the footprint of the tent is the exact dimension of a queen sized air mattress (maybe even a tad smaller as they are relying on the walls to pooch out a bit) and to fill it up you have to lay underneath the mattress and you still won't be able to fill it up all the way if you're using an inflater. I was really disappointed by this and I would have returned this tent if I had known it before I used it. I'll probably get a different tent after this because it was really annoying that I couldn't fill up my air mattress all the way given the limitations of the tent. If you have a twin sized air mattress or camping mats, then this tent is fine for two people. It's cramped and doesn't have much space for your things, but it'll work and the rest of the features of the tent are as expected.

  I've used this tent only once and can't speak to its weather resistance - it didn't rain when I used it.  It does seem to be solid quality, and the bottom seems to be weather proof - the bottom is essentially a tarp attached to the tent sides.With that said, I got the 4 person size, and it was for just me with a camping cot, which wouldn't fit front to back, and barely fit side to side.  If you aren't using a cot, it would be fine as a 2 person tent with gear, but 3 people would start to feel cramped, never mind 4.It's also not a tall tent.  I'm 6'1"" and the next tent I buy will be one I can fully stand in, or at the very least only have to slightly duck.  Can't blame the product for my own personal preferences though when it comes to the cot and my size - if I wanted more room, I should have gotten a bigger tent, right?The tent sets up easy and is pretty self-explanatory:1. Lay it out2. stake the corners3. insert the poles, arch and attach at the plug fitting, then clip to the tent4. inset the rain fly pole, anchor the rain fly to the tent, stake the rain fly on the sidesIt took me about 10 minutes to set up, and it stayed tight all weekend.Overall, I trust the Coleman brand - it's solid quality at prices you can afford - I got a nice deal on this tent and got it for about 38% below the normal pricing, so what's not to like about that?

  I am a camping enthusiast and Marine Corps veteran with years of experiences with tents and camping. Below I outline the deficiencies of this Coleman tent.I recently purchased the Coleman Sundome tent to upgrade capacity from my LL Bean Acadia 2 due to a growing family. Maybe I was spoiled my the quality of LL Bean, but this Coleman Tent is poor quality.During initial setup I discovered  one of the pole A's was broken. Upon further investigation I found that the nylon cord inside the pole had frayed and snapped. I called Coleman customer service and they offered to send a new pole out. They Said it would take over a week to arrive. It never came so I repaired it myself using some ballistic cord I had available. It was a good quick fix.I arrived at the campsite and set up the tent. We had some light rain and I noticed that some rain was entering the tent. I used my light to discover several tears in the tent. I was completely dissappinted in the quality of the tent. It had ripped from light wind or maybe arrived torn.I was unhappy with Coleman's customer service and their qualify overall. They have gone down hill. Their tents won't last a weekend. I would recommend that you all spend a few extra bucks and buy a durable tent to take your family on adventures with and one that will last for many years.

  Overall the tent design is nice. It has the basic features of a modern tent, with the more tarp like bottom of car tents. Unfortunately, the seam of the tarp-bottom and the polyester tent leak. It is interesting that it does not appear to leak everywhere, but instead only on the corner with the port for power cables. I tested this a few different ways to confirm it was the seam and not the port. Furthermore I ordered a second tent to see if mine was  faulty, and both have the same flaw. I will be returning both and shopping around for another brand, probably from REI which tends to stock better gear (though I was hoping for a cheap tent that didn't leak and I wouldn't have to worry about getting damaged at festival and other lighter trips/events)

  Husbands review: First off this is a pretty good tent for the price. It’s nothing I would be backpacking with but I would take it on short trips or car camping. I’m a scout leader and have a very active scout troop. We camp in all conditions. I plan to take this tent out on many adventures to see if it holds up. I’ll update my review in a few months with fall and winter camping reviews.Out of the box, the tent is exactly what I thought it would be...good. It’s not too of the line but it looks of good quality. The tub of the tent is thicker than most I have slept in and that is a huge plus for me. Here’s my eval so far:Pluses:Good priceQuality materialStitching is well doneZipper flaps cover a wide areaTub inside goes high up on the wallsRainfly pole slot is well stitchedCorner pins are sewn into the rings and allows stronger connectionPlenty of Velcro straps to attach to side poles and rainflyPerfect size for an adult with gear to tentDeltas:Cheap tent pegs that just need to be upgradedWhen spread out and pins down, door zipper does not smoothly shut. Needed to have a lot of slack in spread to close door (See pics)Poles seem to bow out too far like they’re about 2 inches too big. They work but seems to bow. (See pics)A bit heavy for backpacking but great for overall camping.More updated reviews as I take it out this fall and winter...standby.

  I read the reviews before purchasing, also the tent was featured on my phone, ""Google News"" report as top tents for 2019. So it solidified my decision, I must say skepticism played a part initially. When I went on a road trip last weekend and chose a campsite, the delivery came the same day. My boyfriend opened the shipment and assembled. I will say it takes two people to setup, trust me. I had my dog in hand and still helped with the setup. It is true to size four people can fit in this tent. I am a thick chick with hips and butt and I must say this product exceeded my expectations. My first camping experience as an adult, since a kid in Girl Scout. The setup wasn't hard, read the directions, take your time, do not rush. I really liked this tent. It rained at the campground, from Saturday to Sunday, the tent fly,  really works. No leakage, no holes, great ventilation.  Really observe this tent, no lights included, However, it is a beauty. Great purchase. I will have a second attempt tomorrow at a different campsite in my hometown, to do another chance in experiencing, and will submit a second review. Bless up!

  Here's what I love about this tent:1. I'm a 65-year-old woman and I can set it up and take it down all by myself!2. After figuring out the details the first time I used it, I was able to get it set up in less than 20 minutes the second time.3. The back window and door window both have zippered flaps so you can keep them open, even when the fly is on.4. I was able to get the tent back in the carrying case on the first try - no problem! Here's the trick---- lay out the fly inside the tent before you start to fold it up- leave the window and door unzipped so it doesn't trap air as you're trying to fold it- use the length of the poles as the guide for how wide the folded tent should be in order to make sure it will fit into the carrying case- once you've folded the tent lengthwise to be no wider than the poles, lay the poles down on the edge of the tent and start rolling the tent (tightly) around the polls- before putting it in the carrying case, tie the tent very tightly once it's rolled upGreat tent!! Have fun!

  I bought this tent last summer for a cross country road trip to California, spending half the trip camping in Yellowstone. The price was right and Coleman branded products have never done me wrong. I didn't test it out before I hit the road due to time constraints. It doesn't take up very much room at all when packed. It actually packs smaller than my sleeping bag. The first stop was Yellowstone and the weather forecast was calling for light rain, so I figured it would be the perfect test for this tent. The setup was very fast and simple, especially with 2 people. I think we set it up in approximately 10 minutes or less without directions. It looked identical to the product photo in the Amazon description. A queen size mattress fit perfectly in this tent, with over a foot to spare on one side. It did indeed rain the first night and the tent held up like a champ. At first, I was worried about the rain fly not being big enough to cover the window screens, but it made it through the night without letting in a single drop of rain. The only complaint I have about this tent is the lack of ventilation. It could definitely use bigger window screens for more of breeze on those hot summer nights.

  We took this on a 9-day camping trip, both rustic and modern sites. It performed beyond my expectations as far as ease of setup and take down, durability, and rain protection. 10 minutes to put up and take down is about right, though with one person I found it took a few minutes longer. I was able to put it up by myself but it's much easier with two of course. It rained for three nights on our trip, one night relatively heavily, and the rain fly did its job keeping the water out. One night our blanket did get wet in the corner where it was against the tent but I'm pretty sure it was from condensation instead of a leak. It got a little windy as well and the tent seemed solid the whole time. The zippers functioned well and the netting worked keeping the bugs out. There was plenty of space for the two of us and the queen air mattress fit fine with enough room for our bags on the side. Really hard to flip it over inside the tent though once inflated so if you need to inflate upside-down like ours and turn over, I'd inflate it outside the tent if possible. I wouldn't try to fit more than two people in here unless they were small children or you're pretty comfortable sleeping almost on top of each other. For the price this is an awesome value overall and I'm very pleased with my purchase.

Tent is set up in less than 10 minutes even when staking into the tough or rocky ground can be troublesome. ** the stakes are weak but the ones usually issued with a tent are so do yourself a favor and invest in some heavy duty stakes right away **.  -- also buy yourself a rubber mallet for staking ease!

  In the product description, it says ""stands up to winds"" -- NOT the case. We really love this tent. It's a great size, easy to assemble and pretty much water proof. However, our first time out in it we had a rainstorm with some wind rip through our campsite which broke BOTH fiberglass poles. The only thing they sell are ""repair kits"" where you can rework and replace sections of the pole, which won't work for us, because the fiberglass splintered in many places. We need entirely new poles. We are going to try and salvage the tent by buying aluminum poles, which are far sturdier. If you're trying to get into camping, buy a tent with aluminum poles or don't bother.  I'm honestly mad it didn't work out.  I say ""mostly waterproof"" because when the wind flattened our tent, water got in through the side netting (normally covered by the rain fly), but then again a tent isn't supposed to stand sideways, is it? Not sturdy at all. To give you an idea: we were asleep when the storm started, and woke up with wind pressing the top of the tent down on our faces. We had to hold it up with our hands until the storm subsided. Also, there are small holes in the corners where the waterproof bottom is sown to the top. Random, zippered holes. Water gets through here. Can't figure out for the life of me what that feature's for, but rain gets through. Thoroughly Pissed.

  Love this tent! My partner and I spent weeks researching a good 4 person tent to take camping in the southern colorado rockies. And we found it! This tent is extremely spacious. The reason we bought such a large tent is because we have 3 dogs and we were all able to have our own space and be totally comfortable. This tent is perfect for people with dogs because it’s heavy duty & when we went camping, it withstood the power of their little claws & didn’t rip - even when they jumped up on the sides to try and look out the windows! It was an extremely easy setup and breakdown - took us 10 minutes at most. This tent is also completely waterproof. We went camping in August - the middle of southern Colorado’s monsoon season - and we got hit suddenly by a pretty bad storm! Not only did our tent stay completely dry inside, but it also stayed in place as we braced 30mph wind gusts. I would recommend this tent to anyone looking for a stress free camping trip!

  Coleman is well-known for the quality of its products. This didn't disappoint. I bought this for Burning Man, which was my mistake. I thought the top of the tent was sealed, but it's not - there is a portion of the top of the dome that is mesh, which is nice if you want ventilation and to have a view of the sky. There's also a rain fly to put over the top to cover the mesh in case it does rain. However, if you're going to the desert where there's sandstorms or similar weather, it's not the best suited as sand/dirt easily flies around the rain cover to get into the tent. This was no fault of Coleman's though - just my ignorance and I hope it helps some of you better prepare by determining if this is the right tent model for your adventures. Good for outdoors, good for the rain, not so good for sandstorms. Aside from that, the tent was sturdy and I was able to put it together by myself in about 10-15 minutes. There are side pockets on the inside, and there's placement to hang a lantern from the center on the inside for light at night. The description says its a 4-person tent, and it probably could fit four ""average"" sized people tightly together without luggage, but it's good sizing for a couple with luggage, and maybe a third depending on how tall/big you all are. For me by myself, it was great having the extra room to have my belongings out. I would highly recommend!

    Good entry-level tent, especially for cubs wanting an easy-up, easy-down tent
  
",4.0,RyanH,"Reviewed in the United States April 18, 2017","









  
  
    
  It's a Coleman.  Great entry-level tent that's easy to put up, even for a 10-year old.  Love the bathtub floor (I sure wish tents had that feature when I was a kid, it would have saved me many nights of gear getting soaking wet).  I also love that the pole sleeves are as small as possible and that it relies on pole clips for most of the length of the poles.  That makes getting the poles in and up so much easier than a full-length sleeve.  I wouldn't exactly call them snag-proof but they're a notable improvement over full-length sleeves.I like the fly on this model, it has one pole that goes front-to-back and does not require much bending.  Similar Coleman models have a smaller fly pole that you have to bend into a U-shape, putting tremendous tension on the fiberglass and subjecting it to splintering.  This model's fly pole is thicker and only has a slight bend so I expect it to last longer.Biggest complaint is the zipper gets caught in the ""zipper cover"" all the time and for kids who don't know any better, they just keep pulling until it's completely jammed.  This is not a great design and needs to be revisited.As with all tents on the market, ""4-person"" means 4 people sleeping right up on each other with no room for gear.  So this is really a tent for 3 people at most.  We've slept 3 in it comfortably (1 adult/2 kids, 2 adults/1 kid) although we did start to run short on room for gear at some point.

    Summer tent. Not for cold
  
",4.0,EkV,"Reviewed in the United States March 30, 2019","









  
  
    
  First time buying and using a tent to go camping. In my infinite wisdom, I decided to purchase a summer tent to camp in the winter. This is definitely a summer tent. It was extremely easy to set up and included just about everything in the bag except for a mallet to hammer the stakes into the ground. The stakes are pretty flimsy but do the job well. I bent one stake when I was hammering it into a rock underneath the soil. Maybe buy some better ones.Set up took me about 5 or 7 Minutes taking my time. The bottom of the tent is noticeably thicker then the rest of the tent but I still used a tarp underneath it to protect it. My issue was that I went camping in February when it was extremely cold. The sides of the tent have mesh screen windows that you cannot zip up. They are covered from the outside like an awning so you can't see through them but a lot of air still gets in. On another side there is a zip-up window cover, which I had zipped up. On the fourth side is a large door and the door also has another window you can unzip if you want. I am 6' 4"" and was unable to stand up in this but I had maybe 4 or 5 ft inside.During the night I went camping it got probably around 20 degrees Fahrenheit. I was very cold inside this tent even layered up, which is more my fault than anything. But everyone should be aware that this is definitely not a tent you take in the winter. The tent, however, did hold up well to the wind that I experienced. Like I said, it was just cold inside.You can probably fit a queen-size inflatable mattress inside this. I used a tall twin mattress and had plenty of room. I wouldn't say that you can fit four people comfortably in this but this is more like a couple's tent I would say maximum two people if you value a little personal space.At the end of my trip, takedown was super simple and I was able to roll it up and fit everything back in the original bag which some people stated that they were not able to do. Just roll tightly.Other than that this is a awesome tent that I will continue to use and make use out of in the summertime when it is warmer. I have no complaints about it and at the price point it is perfect.

    Solid Tent. Keeps You dry. Kind of difficult for a one person setup
  
",4.0,Austin Caldwell,"Reviewed in the United States January 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  Purchased this tent in a rush for a Boy Scout trip with my son. Trusted the Coleman name as my family used their products during my childhood with good results. Overall, I am pleased with this tent. It is roomy, but I'd say any more than three people and it's too crowded for my taste. One thing to not is I DO NOT recommend this tent for fall/winter camping. They put the word ""Sun"" in the name for a reason. This trip was on a cold night in October and the temps fell to about 40 with rain overnight. We were well protected from the rain, but there was little protection from the wind that kept blowing in (Even with the flaps closed) I used an indoor heater to keep us warm so not a huge issue. Another point I'll bring up is i don't recommend putting it together with one person if you can avoid it. My son is 6, so unfortunately was not much help with this baby. Took me a solid 30 minutes to get it set up the first time. None of these items are dealbreakers and I will be taking this tent camping againPros:Good Quality constructionKeeps you dry during light-moderate rainSpacious for up to 3 peopleCons:Can't block out strong windNot for Colder tempsHard to put up with one person if inexperienced

    Shock cord in two of the three poles broke.
  
",1.0,Tiberius,"Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  Shock cord In two of the three poles broke -- before I could put it up the second time! Before we went camping, I set it up, which was easy. I aired it out and used Coleman seam sealer as suggested in several reviews. Giving it time to dry, I took it down the next morning.Friday on Labor Day weekend, I went to put it up, and the shock cord simply unraveled on one pole -- broke. Undaunted I was going to figure out something. As I began to straighten the other long pole, same thing happened in the same way. At this point I was rather daunted.Fortunately, we were not camping far from home. I have two older tents in the garage -- much older. I was able to find two poles of about the same length and diameter. I was able to put up this new tent that way. It's not quite perfect, but it saved the weekend. To recap, I used poles from a tent that was over 10 years old, and the shock cord was still elastic enough and in good enough condition. Only the second time I tried to put of the new tent, the shock cord failed.It rained twice that weekend. Once it rained two hours straight without let up. The next time it rained off and on for several hours. There were no leaks at all. I cannot say if it would have without the seam sealer. One note, a good wind will blow in rain underneath the rain fly. The mesh makes up nearly all of two of the walls, and the rain fly only extends a few inches below. I suppose adjusting the guy lines or stakes might help keep out rain in a strong wind, but I can assure you the wind will blow in rain if it hits hard enough and from a certain direction. Beware.This is definitely not a cold weather tent -- not even a mid to late fall tent. Further, with the rain fly on and tightly secured, there is not that much air flow, and it did get it pretty warm (hot) inside. Adjusting the rain fly without completely removing it is possible and not too much of a headache.In conclusion, my experience with this tent leaves me giving it a one star, because that's all I can do. In fact, it's a negative five stars because it was broken and thus didn't work. Rarely throwing anything out saved me this time. It's past the return window, so I'm not entirely sure where to go from here. I suppose I can get two new poles somehow, but I'm not excited about paying to return the broken ones, which I assume they would want, as that will probably cost me around $15 dollars. Assuming the poles did work, the tent would have been fine. I'm not sure it was what we really needed, but that is on me for not better researching I suppose.

    Not totally waterproof
  
",3.0,Sounds,"Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  The purchase of this tent was predicated on reviews I read online. Most important to me was its waterproofing feature which I found not to be so great. I did a practice setup in my backyard and with an impending rain shower due to a cold front passage it was a good opportunity to test its waterproofing feature. It rained during the early morning , not heavily but a constant  drizzle for sometime. In the morning I opened the tent to find water in every corner on the inside. It was most in the corner where there is a small zipper to allow passage of an extension cord. I had passed through an extension cord a zippered up the best I can. I investigated and found that about 6-8 inches of seam away from each corner had pin holes associated with the stitching. Had I stretched those areas too much when I installed the pegs? Who knows. In any case I acquired a tube of a tent sealant and ran it generously in those areas that seemed compromised. I will follow up with a test after a few days . Other than that I am pleased with this tent so far.Update: So I applied a product , tent seal , which is a liquid , along the seams  of the problem areas , the corners. I applied inside as well as outside about 15 inches or so away from each corner. It drizzled again for an hour or so and all corners except the corner with the through hole for an extension cord was dry. This time though I did not have an extension cord passing through and the zipper was closed all the way. Well this area (corner) had a puddle of water on the floor. There was water in the seam where the upper fabric meets the lower tarp part, so water had to be coming in from that location . I also found the entire zipper to be wet even though the outer flap had covered it.I will wait for that area to dry out and then retreat with  the tent sealant. I will report back.UPDATE Number 2. So I applied tent sealant in the zip area where one can pass through an extension cord. It rained heavily last night and when I checked for water on the inside there only a few drops. So that is much better. The Zipper still got wet so I am thinking of adding somehow a layer of waterproof fabric in that area to reduce or eliminate the entrance of water. Having said that I see in the product description that this tent is now water resistance as opposed to waterproof.

    Good for fair weather/light rain
  
",4.0,WisconsinDuck,"Reviewed in the United States August 17, 2020","









  
  
    
  Overall, this is a safe bet for 2 people that don't mind getting cozy. If a heavy rain is in the forecast, bring an extra tarp. Or more towels.Pros:~ Setup is fairly easy and quick. If you've set up a tent before ever in your life, you'll understand how to set this one up.~ Great views at night if you choose to sleep without the rainfly, due to a generously sized screened roof.~ The addition of the small doormat-type tarp is thoughtful. Even more effective if you buy an inexpensive rug to go on top of that to remove sand and debris from your feet before entering.~ Relatively lightweight. Could serve as a hiking tent for overnight trips.Cons:~ Have a heavy duty ground tarp. I used this tent fresh out of the box with a ground tarp and still ended up with  damage to the floor~ We had steady rainfall for 12-18 hours, and water came in at all 4 corners where the nylon joins to the tub. Being brand new, I didn't think I would need to seal the seams. Apparently, I was wrong.~ Like most tents, this was hot and muggy with the rainfly on, so either be ok with that, or bring a fan.~ If you use this without a rainfly, be aware of who's around if you sleep in the nude or plan to change your clothes. You WILL give someone a show if you're not careful.~ Definitely only fits 2 adults who like each other. Or maybe 3 small, uncommonly cooperative children. It says it would fit a queen size air mattress- I don't know how. With a single cot and air mattress topper, I was out of space.~ Comes with the standard cheap wire stakes. Toss those and get something a little more substantial, like a heavy plastic stake or yard nails.

  EDIT:  We've taken this tent camping in several weather conditions now.  We've been camping in 95 degree heat, temps in the 30's at night, and heavy rain and wind.  We stayed dry in the rain and wind, it vents really well in the heat, and it does reasonably well in cold temps.  I am pleasantly surprised.  I have never owned a Coleman tent before but I'm pretty impressed so far.This review is after our first 3-night camping trip. We bought the 6-person tent. This is a nice tent for the price if you consider what it's made for and what it's not made for.  I recommend this for 2 people (and 3 dogs) or a small family. The tent is half mesh so this tent is great for warm weather, not so great for cold weather. It is very breathable though so condensation is not a problem.  We put a queen mattress inside and there is just enough room on the sides to walk bent over or for some gear.  The temperature got down into the mid 40's at night and we were plenty warm enough with our good sleeping bags. The third day was about 95 degrees in the daytime and the tent vented as well as any tent would. You could remove the rain fly if you wanted but I prefer the privacy. It's really easy to set up, really easy. It took us less than 15 minutes to set up. The tent pegs are just the standard cheap tent pegs that any tent comes with. We have nicer tent pegs that we always use. Always put a tarp down underneath the tent as a ground cover. We would not take this tent if the weather forecast called for rain or wind or freezing temps. We have a much more expensive tent if we are going to be camping in extreme conditions. I wouldn't call this a 3 season tent. I would call this a summer tent. I like it for its simplicity and convenience. The little zippered corner to run an extension cord through is a nice touch. So, I recommend this for light duty camping. I would take a different tent for more extreme conditions.

  Finally been able to test it last weekend. As much as I was disappointed with overall camping experience - pouring rain and wind for two nights in a row - and some rain in between, the more I liked quality of the tent. I was the only person in a group of ten people whose tent did not leak. Granted, by the end of the camping event the walls were soaking wet but the tent was still dry inside.It is quite spacious and fits two queen size inflatable mattresses side by side (but with no space in between) and then there is about two feet wide space left  by one side of the tent for storage.There are two windows with a zippered flap and one side of the tent is a mesh with no flap (which I disliked since the wind would blow water from under the rain cover into that window). Also, there is a protective sleeve covering a door zipper which would constantly get caught into a zipper and require some jiggling in the middle of the night which was not an optimal timing if you catch my drift.Overall, i do like the design and quality with just minor flaws.

  I ordered this tent to do some disperse summer time camping and Amazon was offering a good deal on it. I'm really pleased with it so far. Had it set up with some help from my friend in about 10 minutes and was able to break it down myself in about 5-10 minutes.I had read reviews about how waterproof it is, but decided to spray the tent and seams with some Alsko waterproofing tent spray I had and let it cure for 48 hours while set up in my backyard. This baby is extremely waterproof now, surviving a summer thunderstorm, staying completely dry.The bottom of the tent is made of tarp like material but I *highly* recommend using a tent footprint to keep it from ripping and ensuring the bottom stays dry. I just use a tarp I picked up at harbor freight for a few bucks and stake it into the ground with the tent.I did not bother using the tent stakes that came with the tent, instead I used heavy duty metal tent stakes I already own. The ones they send are kinda janky and may not hold the tent well when there's a lot of wind gusts.There's a lot of ventilation in this tent making it perfect for camping during the summer. Air moves very well, especially when you have the entrance and window unzipped. Sorta wish the screen covered the entire entrance but that's ok.The rainfly is easy to put on, using just one pole and covers the tent well. Use the guylines on it to stake into ground to keep the tent more stable in windy weather. It's also really nice that you can leave it off if there's no rain forecasted so you can look up into the night sky and enjoy the stars.It does have a ring for hanging a lantern but it's not very heavy duty so I just used it to hold a small collapsible solar lantern. Has two pockets, one on each side to hold lighter objects like a phone or small flashlight. It has a flap to run an extension cord into the tent, which is cool. If you're mostly doing car camping, this is a solid choice. It takes up very little room, only weighs a couple pounds and is super easy to set up/break down. I would not recommend this for backpacking tho.I definitely agree with others that this is a summer tent. There's so much ventilation in it that it would probably be uncomfortable to camp in lower temperatures. I do a majority of my camping in the southeast so it'll be fine for me in the spring and early to mid fall but if you're in colder climates definitely keep this one for summer use only.Overall, I'm satisfied with my purchase and it meets the requirements I need it for. Seriously, if you're looking for an inexpensive tent to do some weekend camping here and there, this would be a great choice. I did purchase the 4 person tent, even tho I mostly camp alone, so if a friend decided to join me there's adequate room. Easily fits 2 adults with some room for gear. When I'm alone, I can fit my sleeping bag and all my gear comfortably. It is 7ftX9ft.

  I have used this tent a few times a year for the past few years and I have to say that I am pretty pleased after looking into purchasing other types of tents. It's very lightweight and compact, and it's simple to setup by yourself. I have, in fact, squeezed four grown men into this for a single night. Yes, it was tight, but it was not intolerable. Four on the floor with small backpacks and it was just fine. Normally I like to use this tent for just myself a cot. It gets really tight with two cots. As far as the waterproofing, I have spent at least one night in heavy downpours and multiple nights with moderate rain and I have never seen a single drop get inside. I have taken this down river in a canoe and it has even been blown into a thorn bush (I got lucky there was no major damage). I would definitely recommend this tent for someone in search of an all-around reliable tent. It's reasonably priced and it has done me very well.

  Our 7 year old daughter had been asking for a tent, which was a little weird since we've never gone camping with her.  Being that I've been trying to get my wife to commit to a short camping weekend for years, it made my day.Regardless, I was happy to look for a basic tent that could hold 2 people comfortably, and 4 in a pinch.  I needed something easy for one person to put up, since if/when we go camping, she'd be dealing with the kids while I set up the site (and the kids ""helping"" me wouldn't do much until they get a little older).  I also didn't want something pricey, since there was no guarantee that it would get used a second time.This tent looked to be a good fit for our admittedly basic needs.  Though we got it for her as a holiday present, we didn't use it until Memorial Day, albeit in the backyard.  Setup was a breeze, though it's a bit annoying when putting the poles through as they'll catch from time to time on the fabric; she helped feed the poles through though which did made a difference.  Plenty of room for two (four would be snug), zippers were easy for her to use (doesn't seem like a big thing, but some tents have crappy zippers), but you do need to pay attention so as to not catch the fabric in the teeth.Taking it down was easy; it helped that I could just throw the deconstructed tent over the swingset to dry out (from the dew) of course.  I did like that the bag was big enough to easily fit the tent after folding/rolling it up once it dried...I've had a couple tents where you had to really struggle to get it back in.All in all I'm really happy with this purchase.  It's much better quality than I was expecting given the price, and the bells and whistles that some more expensive tents come with shouldn't be an expectation here.  It hits the sweetspot of good quality and good price, and most importantly, it's given my daughter and I a nice bonding experience (my Father's Day present from her is another backyard campout).

  It's a cheap tent. This cuts both ways of course. So far my only problem is that the material on the base of the tent has developed a couple small (head of a pin) sized holes after only a few times camping. I've put a tarp under it every time expecting some crappy material here, but this wasn't enough to avoid the holes and scuffing.Interior is holding up well.  Seams are all right. Cords and pulls aren't pulling loose or breaking. Overall a great sized tent that I can share with my two boys very comfortably and, at 6'3"" stand up in with no problems. The bag is a bit strange IMO as it features a tear-away sash. With the sash in place the tent barely fits back in the bag after careful preparation. After it's torn away the bag is huge with lots of extra space so the tent doesn't hold a good shape and makes kind of a lumpy loaf that doesn't balance or pack well.

Reminds me of times I spent in the countryside of SW Wisconsin. Material is sturdy, design good and there is enough room for 4 average size adults. Took about 5-10 minutes to set up once we figured out what all the parts do and where they go. I guess my only gripe with this tent is the stakes. They should be at least 3-6 inches longer. We left our tent out a few weeks ago when Chicago had 50+ MPH winds and came home to it blown over. Not the tent's fault. The stakes were deep in the ground but the wind must have been so strong to have pulled them out.

  My husband and I used a Coleman cabin tent for many years but now, planning a trip to the San Juan Islands, it was time to see what else was available.  This is our first dome tent. We set it up at home to practice and I’m glad we did. Once we figured it out we were able to set up and take down easily. We bought the 4-person tent which is comfortable for two adults; we would have felt cramped with a third except possibly a small child. Got a little worried setting up the tent in Washington’s Moran State Park. The entire top and part of the sides are covered with a mesh and it started to rain. Then we figured out how the rain flap worked. And it does work. This little tent stood up to pouring rain and high winds for two days and nights without leaking at all. Kind of funny – we saw someone with the same tent and rain flap who put a tarp over the whole thing. Didn’t need it to stay dry but maybe it provides extra warmth. I think we’ll try it next time. We just bought a second Sundome tent for future trips with the family.

  I purchased this to be able to quickly pop up a tent from car/truck and NOT backpacking with it taking up as least space as possible. The tent is packaged in a box inside the carrying bag. Once the tent is out of the box, the carrying bag has a way of expanding to be larger than what is shown on the photo, making it bigger than what you may think. The tent goes up easy and is somewhat self explanatory. The instructions are permanently part of the storage bag and easy to read. It comes with metal loop spikes and a rain cover (which may be the most challenging part of putting the tent together). Hammer to pound in loop spikes into ground not included.I didn't have any issues with the zippers getting stuck while opening and closing the access panel.

I will say it's harder to sleep in with the green version over the blue as the rising sun radiates through it. The green seems to stay cooler than the blue in the afternoon sun however when you are ready for a little after lunch nap at base camp. The only modification I have made is to ditch the tent stakes and tie on a fewish feet of 550 cord to secure it to rocks/trees whatever. It's lighter and more secure. Enjoy.

  I had to go back to my purchase history and add a review for this tent after a recent camping trip.  Due to poor location choice next to a a barn, all of the barn roof runoff collected into a 4"" deep puddle around this tent.  Nothing seeped into it, but there was maybe 1/2 cup of water to clean out the next morning as the screen was mostly open due to the heat.  I remember camping 25 years ago and any water on the ground came right into the tent. Things sure have improved!

  I waited to write this review until I had a few trips with it under my belt. After spending four nights in it during two separate trips, I’m pleased to report this tent is awesome!It was super easy to put together. Setup was about 10 minutes and didn’t even require directions to figure out.The durability seems to be good. However, I feel this is something I won’t be able to provide feedback on until I see how it holds up over the next few trips.What I think is the most important thing to mention, and why I felt so strongly to give 5 stars is how well it held up during two nights of thunderstorms on my most recent trip. First I was nervous to freeze because the temps were in the 50s and I didn’t have anything special for a sleeping blanket. Somehow with all the windows zipped up, it stayed pretty toasty in the tent. On top of staying warm, we stayed completely dry! There were no leaks or drips anywhere. On the second night, our blankets that were pressed between the side of the tent and our air mattresses became a little damp but that could’ve been from condensation because there was no visible water in the tent.I paid right around $100 for the 6 person tent and it had far exceeded my expectations so far!

    Get a bigger tent if you want a queen air mattress

  Setup 8/10Sturdiness 8/10Size as advertised 5/10This was a nice little tent for the price but the size description is extremely misleading.The product description specified that this tent can hold a queen air mattress. What it failed to mention was that the mattress would fill the entire floor space and there would be no room for anything else. Luckily, we purchased a full size air mattress (since the store was out of Queen) so we had a sliver of floor space to maneuver around in. Getting the air mattress inflated in the tent was fun as you can’t pump the air mattress up inside but you also can’t comfortably try to fill it from the outside. The entryway itself was not wide enough to fit the mattress through either.What took the cake was trying to to get out of the tent without rolling over your sleeping mate as there was no room to maneuver except for on the mattress itself. And if you’ve ever slept on the air mattress, you will surely remember the motion transfer that happens when moving- imagine being in a giant bouncy house and you’ll experience our two days in this tent (we had many moments of laughter when someone tried to exit).If you want somewhere to put your bags or your feet, either buy a larger tent to truly accommodate a queen mattress or purchase a twin so you have room to walk around. If you don’t need/want an air mattress, then this would be a great tent.

    VERY SMALL/NOT FOR ADULTS
  
",3.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States September 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  We needed an extra tent for my daughter and her husband for our camping trip. I bought this tent because the description and measurements listed said it was a 4 person tent and seemed that it would be big enough. The description also said it would fit a queen size air mattress. This is NOT a 4 person tent! 4 children may fit in it but not 4 adults. Once we put in the queen mattress it took the entire floor space and there was no room to walk around it nor to put a fan in there. You had to climb in to the bed from the door opening and crawl across the bed to lay down. We are average size (everyone is under 6ft) and you can't stand up in the tent. They only slept in it one night because they couldn't put in a fan and it was too hot. If you want a little tent for youths or teens with bed rolls this is fine. It didn't rain so I can't say if it was weather proof/water tight. It was easy to put up and take down. Wish I hadn't bought it as I have no use for it.

  This is a Great tent.  I bought two of these for my boys to attend the Boy Scouts.  The inside was much bigger than I expected.  My boys are 10 and 13, they were able to set up and break down the tents with minimal to no assist from me.  The design is very easy to assemble and very straight forward.  The fly was also easy to put in place.  My 10 year old is a little shorter than average and did need a little assistance placing this.When the tent was set up, myself, 10 year old and 6 year old little girl had plenty of room and could have placed some equipment inside.  At 7 ft by 5 ft the boys should not out grow these.Compact size was another bonus when rolled up .  This could easily be carried on a backpack or motorcycle is camping that way,This was a great purchase looking forward to many years of use.

  I bought this tent about 6 years ago. I probably camp about 10 to 14 nights a year. This has held up incredibly well, all the stitching is still fine. I sealed the seams before I used it and I did not do one of the corners which then leaked the first time I went out. So I would definitely say if you're going to be in the rain cover with a tarp or seam seal. I can't speak to multiple wet nights because when I have been in heavy downpours anticipated I've covered it with a tarp.  easy enough to do for peace of mind, although really that first downpour everywhere that was sealed held well. for the price it's been a phenomenal little tent for car camping. Very easy to put up. Well ventilated but I've even camped in 35 degrees and been fine.

  I read a bunch of reviews on a bunch of different tents.  Every tent, a few people in the reviews complain about theirs leaking. Even the expensive ones.  So I got this one.I tested it's effectiveness in being waterproof with a hose. This is not a good simulation of rain drops, which would be separate and spaced out.  But 90% of the seams it did not leak, but in the places water droplets came through, I could see the sun lighting up the yellow thread at the inverted seams, that were not in the inverted seam.  So it is easy to find.  I will seam seal these locations. I am outside the return period on the tent. I did have a huge leak problem at the zipper.  I'm not sure why water is coming through yet.  I am going to use waterproofing spray on the yellow flap that covers the zipper.  If that doesn't work, I will literally use wide, clear tape on the yellow flap, or cut out tarp slightly larger and glue that on with a waterproof glue. I really shouldn't have to. I don't think they treated the yellow flap that covers the zipper.It is described as waterproof, but it is only for light rain.  Glad other people got a really good version of this tent and stayed bone dry!  More people said it was fully waterproof than less.  I was unlucky.

  Literally 5 minute tent setup; only complaint would be the length of the poles (once extended and connected) makes it a bit of a hassle to slide through as needed for setup; but overall; easy peasy.  This is a summer tent; meaning that you will get ALOT of exposure; even with the cover/tarp on; you will still get some exposure. THis is a good thing for airflow/etc. If your expecting tons of privacy and possible usage for winter type conditions; this is not for that.  Overall; it holds up well; it easily accomodates 2 adult w/ Queen air mattress and some gear.  4 person tent; not adults, maybe kids. But can be accomodating w/ 3 people w/o air mattresses and gear, yes possible. I did not get any chance to see how it does in rain/etc. but my other coleman tents I have have held up fantastic; so I'd expect and hope for nothign less from this tent as well.  I do wish teh tent door had a pole for some rigidity to open/close like a door like some of the other coleman tents have; this is zipper up and floppy; but not a complaint; just a wish.  The bag and items are all self contained and small like a duffle bag in size once your roll everything back up; not too heavy; but not exaclty light either (assuming your carrying other gear of course).  It's a good one! and I""m glad we got it! I expect years of usage out of it!; great product.

  Great quality, capacity and easy set up with 2 ppl (slightly more challenging with 1 person, but still doable). Ordering this tent for the second time.Had our first one for over 4 years, we generally camp 10-20 nights every summer. Quite honestly, I think if we took better care of it (like completely dried it off after each camping trip and sprayed waterproofing on every year in the beginning of camping season) we could have used it for a another year or two. But the old one got a bit moldy and smelly and the roof started leaking a bit, so we decided to order a new one for upcoming road trip. Looked into some other brands for a few days to see if there’s a decent competition for the sundome, and came to a conclusion that it is still the best deal for the price. Tarp floor material that comes up onto the walls of the tent is a GAME CHANGER if you get caught in seriousrain. The big side windows are amazing for ventilation and stargazing in dry weather, the rain cover protects very well even in toughest rain (although I still recommend applying a fresh coat of weatherproofing to the roof and walls yearly).I will make sure to take better care of this one, and hopefully we won’t need a new tent for about 5-6 years.

  I bought this tent in 2017 when I saw it on sale for $39.99 without any intention of using it anytime soon but having one just in case. Due to everything going on this year, I was going nuts being stuck inside so I finally took the plunge and started using it for camping adventures in the Rocky Mountains. So far, so good! I've used this tent 4 separate times now and about 6 nights of sleeping so far. My first trip was a solo one and I had never pitched a tent before by myself. The instructions on the bag tag didn't make the most sense but after about 20 minutes I figured it out on my own. Now I can setup or take down the tent by myself in 5-10 minutes, even less if I have some help.The included rain-fly is very nice for that purpose as well as providing shade over the mesh openings if you're trying to sleep in a little in the mornings. There are two side windows you can open up for a nice breeze and viewing. Everything zips up nice and easy, however I would advise using both hands when zipping or unzipping the main door. It does have a tendency to catch fabric in the zipper if you're not careful.I have only slept in the tent by myself so far using a 4"" memory foam mattress. Plenty of room for 1-2 people. A family of 3-4 could probably fit comfortably in here with sleeping bags and small children. I don't think 4 adults could sleep too comfortably unless everyone was very cozy with each other.The included tent stakes are pretty weak. I've already bent almost half of them, so anticipate buying a new set of them at some point. Not a big deal. I had to use rocks to secure my tent better after some high wind gusts blew it around a little bit.Overall the quality of this tent is very nice and I would buy it again, especially at the price I paid. I see now the price is $69.99 which is probably still a fair price but in that range I would recommend doing some research and seeing if there is a better buy but even at full price this is a good quality tent. So far the coldest I've slept in it was around 40° weather with some light rains and I stayed warm with just a couple blankets, no sleeping bag. I don't know if this would be a good tent for winter camping but I think it would hold up just fine for some late fall snowfall and cold temps when the off-season has begun.

I also seam seal an area of about 1' square on the top of the fly, where all the seams cross because often there are low spots that will hold water on the top of fly.  Especially on the corners where the rings are for the stakes.  The vent on the back really does work.  I use a same usb fan to circulate the air to cool the tent while the air temp goes down.  The little flap for a power cord is a super nice addition.To me no other tent in its price range even comes close.

  Tent camping has come a long way.  This tent is extremely reasonably priced and is working great.  I bought this tent because my boyfriend is a bit of a tent camper.  I grew up in a camper trailer so my experience with tents are pretty limited.My first experience with a tent was 20 years ago.  I was in a old different tent with two other teens and it rained and flooded out our tent.  One of the ladies had brought a full mattress which took up much of the floor and it was soaking wet for the rest of the week.With this experience in mind, I set off on this tent's maiden voyage with great trepidation.  Of course.  The worst happened.  It POURED rain and BLEW wind all night.  I was dry in the morning and the tent was still standing.  I was impressed.  There was no way that the tent I had my first tenting adventured in would have faired so well.I love this tent.  I've used it 4 times now.  The only qualm I have is the bag zipper broke.  But seriously, for the price, this has been a great tent.  Super easy to assemble.

  I had not been camping and thus devoid of experience with tents for well over 35 years.  With that in mind, I bought two of these and headed out for 7 nights of camping.  I was pleasantly surprised when I unpacked them and was able to assemble them both in a matter of minutes without looking at the instructions.  You don't have to be a engineer to figure out what to do.  As a matter of fact, it may help not being an engineer, because engineers can screw up a one man parade.  But that's the biggest reason I took the vacation, to get away from the engineers at my job.Anyway, we experienced some good days and some rainy days, and these held up without any issues.  We had two small adults in one tent, and two adults, a small child, and a dog in the other tent.  I was expecting the second one to be a bit cramped, but it was actually fine.  Our experience led us to buy a camper but that was not due to any fault of the tents.  I will probably keep them in the camper just in case someone pisses me off and I can make them sleep outside without feeling guilty.

  So I bought this for a camping trip this summer up by the coast. It was fine during the day but at night the wind blew right in and cold seeped into this tent. I was sleeping with a lot of blankets, a big comforter, flannel sheets and another person on a tall air matress elevated from the ground and it was still freezing. Would only recommend for any place that doesn’t get below 60 at night. I didn’t realize when I bought the tent that the big “ mesh windows” were always windows. As in there is no zipper flap to cover the mesh with a more solid fabric so they are always open, which also means without the rain fly you would have no privacy. It didn’t really rain while we were camping but it did get moist on a few of the days and the rain fly did keep the water out. It does say in the description that it’s good for warm weather but also makes it sound like it can withstand some mildly cold weather by stating that it can withstand winds and rain and I feel like a paid a lot for a tent that is neither that big nor good for any weather that isn’t 70 or above.

  for the $40 I paid for it, this is a fantastic little tent.  It goes up easy, comes down easy, and if you don't do it horribly wrong, you can even get it back into the bag on a repeatable basis.  the tent floor is the waterproof tarp material, pretty durable.  We put coleman cots in it when we camp, and have not had any issues with the cot feet damaging the floor.  Per the usual, the ""four person"" rating is always a bit of a stretch.  This will exactly hold 2 coleman cots, or probably 3 people on the ground on pads.  4 kids, maybe.  We've camped in it in the rain, wind, and snow and it has held up just fine.  I really do not have any complaints or concerns about it, especially for the price.  The only thing I'd recommend is to really stake it down, don't skimp on that, you'll see the best form and interior space if you properly stake it down.

  I used this tent for the first time last weekend with my 8 year old twin boys for boy scouts camp out. It is a great looking tent and easy to set up and take down. It took us maybe 15 minutes. I got the full experience in just 24 hours. We set up in hot and dry conditions.  At first glance it looked like it was well constructed and  pretty roomy inside. Thankfully, I  put the rain fly on because a heavy thunderstorm rolled through a few hours later. I was worried the tent was going to be a goner. There were high winds and heavy rain. We took shelter in a big common area and after the first part of the storm passed we went to check on the tents. To my amazement, it was still standing and completely dry. We thought about leaving, but decided to stay. About an hour later it started raining again, so we decided to retreat to our tent for the night. After having all 3 of us in, I quickly noticed how cramped we were.  I did have one twin air mattress that took up most of the room in the tent. Now, I could have arranged things better in the tent, but I still felt like we were on kind of on top of each other. It did continue to rain very steady through the entire night. Although we were super hot and sticky, we did stay dry with the exception of one or 2 random drops from the rain fly.All in all I am very happy with this purchase, but  I would not recommend more than 3 people in this tent.Pros:Looks great with the yellow and blueHeld up and stayed dry in a heavy rain stormeasy to set up and take downCons:A little small for a 4 person tentLike I said, I am happy with the purchase and I am looking forward to using it again.

  I picked this up to be a tent just for myself while chaperoning my a camping trip for my son's class.I was very happy with it. The setup and tear down time was fast, the instructions were clear, and it was easy to unpack and re-pack. As a one person tent, it was awesome—I had space to put my sleep mat and the rest of the tent for my pack and various gear that had unpacked. As a two person tent, it would work but might feel a little cramped.It got pretty hot inside during the day, but it was in the mid 80s for the trip and we had very little wind at the camp site. I was pitched next to a tree that provided some shade during the day, but as the sun moved around the tree the tent heated up a lot. I don't consider this a flaw of the tent, though. I had the rain flap on to be paranoid, and I'm sure that was trapping heat. It still cooled off pretty quickly at night and was comfortable to sleep in. We never had any rain, so I can't comment on whether it would've kept me dry, but it seems like I wouldn't have had much trouble.Definitely recommended

Very roomy (we had 2 adults and a toddler in there.)My issue is with these 2 mesh sides. The weather wasn’t even that cold (in the 50s at night) and we had proper colder weather gear but we were still freezing all night because of the wind (it wasn’t even that windy just every breeze gave you a chill.) The rain fly helped a little but this tent really is ONLY for the warmest of days. Every other tent I owned let you open the mesh or close it but not this one. I was really disappointed in this fact because living in the north that only gives us a short amount of time during the summer to use this tent. I’m going to have to buy a cold weather tent for for the spring and fall and just didn’t want to have to spend that extra money.Besides this fact it was a fabulous tent and I would recommend for anyone camping in hot weather.

  I am a newbie to camping and bought this tent to join my friends for about 4 days at camp on a beach. This tent held up as well as my friends' high end tents and was pretty roomy inside. I was out in the desert and, fortunately for me, did not have any rain while there. I can't speak to how well it will hold up in the rain.I do need to replace the tent after my adventure, not because of a tent failure but as a dog owner failure. My dog has separation anxiety and I stupidly zipped her up in the tent to run into the woods for a pee break. Next thing I knew she was standing in front of me and I had a dog sized hole in the tent (as seen to the right of the door in the picture).At only $40, it's cheaper to get a new tent and use this one as a sun screen for the beach than try to repair it to be water proof.Really good tent for the money...especially if you're not a serious camper and looking to enjoy the wilderness intermittently.

  I was caught in a bad hiking experience with my dog. Pitch black, bugs swarming us. In a forest with no cellular reception. We couldn't find the sanctioned camp area but we were both also overheating.I laid the tent out flat, put my gear in the door to keep bugs from getting in my bag, zipped the door up and began.Two metal poles threaded in an ""X"" pattern and my tent was up. Didn't have the energy to put the rain tarp on, so a couple drops of water splashed in from the treetops, but I was so thankful to be in shelter. I bought the 4-person version. Tons of space for me and my 75lb dog. Could have fit another person easy and still have plenty of space for our gear.No bugs got in the entire night.Love this tent. Putting it away wasn't horrible, but of course its a little harder to roll than unroll. Just do a practice run before camping. Totally recommend this tent.

    Fits 2 adults on Queen air mattress
  
",5.0,Surrey Summer,"Reviewed in the United States January 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  Small little tent that can fit a queen air mattress and a bit more wiggle room for your stuff. So it comfortably fits 2 grown adults and a 40lb dog (she had her bed at the foot of our air mattress). Sure it can fit 3-4 adults but they have to be smaller/petite humans. Definitely not for cold or freezing temps tho: on either side of the tent is screen only with no option to zip up to completely close off the tent, but it’s covered by the upper tarp (that goes over the whole dome) so there’s privacy and blocks wind. But really if it’s under 50 degrees Farenheit or any kind of strong wind, you will feel It due to this screen. And someone came to stick their head under this tarp to look into the tent, they would see into the tent. But what’s great is this screen does prevent the condensation forming so your tent will stay dry through the night. I do think this tent is waterproof. Tip: Put it where you can get some shade during the day because it can get really hot inside under full sun. Happy camping!

  Very easy to set up.. I am a small female and set this up by myself in under 8 minutes on concrete which is important if you are car camping and need to set up without stakes.  The tent is well ventilated - I like the floor vent because I live in the desert and need the air.  The dark blue is great for sleeping in and keeping tent cool in the summer.  The outlet vent for electronics is nice and all of the zippers are well made. Door is large and windows are high quality. Bathtub floor keeps you dry even in a downpour.  Packs very easily back into the bag and you even have a little extra room if you need it.  I purchased the 3 man and don't need extra room.. it is roomy and I like the height-  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this tent!

  Bought the tent for a two week kayak trip. Also used for two week national park camping trip. Tent set up and take down easy even with one person. As others have said, leave rain fly off on clear nights and watch the stars but keep rain fly in tent with you for those late night surprise storms for rapid installation.  Only issue was one of the pole end metal pieces came off when taking down the tent (while pulling through the tent slot for the pole) but was easily solved with duct tape. Several storms no rain leaks even without joint sealing that others mentioned. Not a flaw but tent design focused on good air flow which means it does not keep any heat in on cold nights. Overall as good as a much more expensive tent.

  This dark colored tent (I chose not to go with the brighter yellow/green color) enabled me to sleep later in the mornings and set up easier without the tent poles getting stuck in the sleeve because the sleeve is all one-not divided (see amazon and mfgr write up). I camp solo at state/county/national campgrounds (not in the wild). This tent is too heavy for backpacking, but fine for ""car camping.' It's a taller center than many so easy in-out access and I can stand inside the tent with just my head bent if need be (I'm 5'5-1/2"" tall). Plenty of room for me solo - I typically fit in one single air mattress, a tall folding chair and have plenty of room for bags, and moving around etc. On one trip I used a double mattress and still had room for a tall folding chair and baggage (though less roomy). Half of the ceiling is screen vented, so not a good one for cold camping though a good cold weather sleeping bag should make you comfy. There are two pouches for holding small items on each side of the inner tent, and a ceiling loop for attaching a light weight light. Door has a screened window that zips close and other side also has a large screen window with zip. I don't see the point of the additional small screen along the bottom rear of the tent which has a cover though that cover can't be velcroed closed - you peg it open or shut (therefore not ever really shutting off the air flow). Plenty of ventilation already and I didn't want any air hitting my head (I stuck a sweater over it from the inside). Regarding weather proofing, it does have it's own tarp. Plus, I always spray a weather proofing on any new tent and it's tarp prior to going out anyway, and also always bring along a store-bought plastic tarp to throw over my tents just in case something a bit strong passes through  (because I don't trust ANY relatively inexpensive tents), so I can't speak to it's weather proofing. I'm sure it is weather resistant for an occasional light drizzle-Suggest you check other reviewers for their experience. I happy with this little dandy.

Fold tent's two long sides to middle if tent then fold in half longways. This should make tent sz shorter than pole bag. Place pole bag onto one long end of tent and roll tent around pole bag, compressing as you go. Ta-Da!

  I purchased this tent for summer camping with my adult daughter. Snagged it for less than forty bucks during a Lightening Deal without high expectations and was pleasantly surprised by its build quality and features. The low profile allows it to hug the ground and in my test run in foul weather (rainy, windy, cold...) iI felt dry and secure inside. Even with wet ground, I didn't feel like the wind could or would lift up the tent.While it's a 4-person tent, I'd say more like ""2-adults and a dog"". A queen sized air mattress will fit inside the tent if desired, with a little room to spare.All in all for me, it's an incredible value.  It's a good choice for spring, summer and early fall in moderate climates. Small enough to pack away in any size vehicle, and easy to set-up within 10 minutes. I'm really happy with the Coleman quality. While it's not a heavy-duty 4-season tent, I would definitely recommend it to couples for weekend and concert camping.

  This was my first tent purchase, and I love almost everything about this tent, especially how easy it is to put up. It's easy to pack and unpack even with just one person.In terms of weight, it isn't too heavy, but I wouldn't want to go backpacking or have to walk a long distance with it. The carrying case does make it easier.The one thing I don't really like and the reasoning for the four stars is that I don't like the design of the zipper door, as the zipper gets hung. Also, when it rains and you try to unzip it, the door wants to fall inward causing the rainwater to fall in.The rain canopy is also a bit cumbersome, but I wouldn't knock off a star for that.Overall I am very pleased with it and would recommend it to those wanting an affordable, easy to use tent.

  The tent just saved us from our 5-day camping. We got lucky or what, we had 4-days raining(showers) during our stay in the park. The tent has 0 leaking and kept us dry inside with rainfly on the top. We are very impressed and happy with the quality of it.The tent itself is relatively light-weighted and easy to carry, small enough to put into our car trunk. Setup is easy, except a little effort to raise it up from the middle which usually requires two person to finish that. Once that part is done, it's just a piece of cake to put the rest together. It took me about 15 minutes to fully set it up or torn down to pack. The tent is spacious inside(fits two full airbeds plus one twin pad easily with still some empty space), especially it's very tall, though we are not that impressed with its squared shape(no big deal with us). Build quality is great, and it seems very durable. Once setup correctly, wind does not blow it away easily either. Great product!

  My 10 year old is a Scout and decided he wanted a 2 or 3 person tent instead of the 7 one we had already. He will be a Big Scout next year and didn't want something so big since it will be just him and one other boy for now on. So this is the tent he and I decided on. BEST purchase ever. It held 2 air mattresses perfectly, but left no room for anything else. I mean, NOTHING. Maybe a couple flash lights would have fit, but no room left for clothing or backpacks or anything you would need to take camping. So we decided to let him and the other 2 boys use the tent and I used one of the other mom's tent. All 3 boys fit with no problem in their sleeping bags. They had room for one of those trunks that keep all your food and clothing dry and bugs out. They also had room for their shoes and flashlights. They were pleased with all the room they had. I would HIGHLY recommend this tent. It took me and my 10 year old 10 minutes to set up from start to finish. It was very easy to not only put up, but to take down. We allowed the boys to take it down since they have to do it all on their own for now on. It took the 3 of them, all 10 yr olds, approximately 25 min to take the whole thing down, roll up, and fit back into the bag. Though an adult had to help them zip it all up into the bag, it was not a difficult process for them to do. Not overwhelming and not too small either. Everything you need, comes with the bag. You will not be disappointed.

  Rain fly barely covers all the openings. It’s very windy inside if it’s windy outside. Did well with a light rain. Don’t imagine it would do so well if it were any harder of a rain. Center should have a hook or bag to hold a light but it doesn’t. The air vent doesn’t have any way to stay open but the rest is so open it doesn’t really matter anyway. The bag it comes in has a rip away ribbon to make it bigger. That was thoughtful, as one can never really get it rolled back up as tightly as the original packaging. In short is an okay tent. If I were to be out in weather lower than 40 degrees or during a storm I would not use this tent. It’s nice and big for the purpose of fitting my daughter’s pack n play inside along with all our gear and space to sleep. Once she is able to sleep on the ground with a blanket with the adults we will be looking for a better smaller tent. And will use this as a place to hangout in the day. Or for storing our food.

  I really like this tent.  Roomy inside, zippers work well.  Ventilated nicely.  I generally set this up by myself.  Having a second person does speed things up a bit.  THIS TENT IS NOT PARTICULARLY STABLE IN HIGH WINDS but it does hold together.  That's the reason I took one star off.  But if it's not too windy, you can just put something heavy in the tent to hold it down, and skip staking it altogether.  The included stakes are not very good, but that's typical for most tents.  Get some stakes elsewhere.  My only pet peeve is that the clips which hold the top tarp to the tent poles do not snap on securely.  This isn't a problem once assembled, but if it's breezy/windy when you are setting this up, it can cause frustration when the top tarp keeps disconnecting and wandering away.  It's comfortable for 2 people and luxurious for one person if you like to have lots of stuff in the tent with you.  Personally I wouldn't put more than 2 adults in the tent unless you like being super close to each other.  If you're not tall you can _almost_ stand up fully in the middle of the tent.  Has a couple pockets on the sides, and a hook on the ceiling to hang a (electric) light from.

  My husband and I bought the 6 person tent for a week long camping trip. We were pretty impressed with it as it withheld a severe thunderstorm with hail and tornado like winds. It had some leaking though but for as much rain as we had gotten I was impressed with how little it did let in. I had the option to waterproof the seams when buying and in trying to be cheap I didn't. I wish I had because it did cause a bit of a headache for the water it let in (it was enough to wet my husband sleeping bag in the corner).The tent was somewhat roomy. We put in a queen air mattress and you could probably put a twin in there as well but you wouldn't have any space for bags. Which was a downside for me. It was easy to put together and take down. You could easily do it yourself if needed.I've seen them cheaper through Ebay now as well but overall we were happy with this tent.

   I should first specify I spent about $50 for this item.  The 2 person 7 foot by 5 foot model; about 4' at the highest point inside.  It does seem big enough for 2.  Even a very tall person could use it easily corner-to-corner and perhaps have room enough for 2 small people as well...It is a very ""open"" type of tent: if you leave the rainfly off then you will have an hourglass-shaped window to the stars above you. It seems like many people buying a tent might want it to be more insulated but I think for climates that don't get too cold or windy this may be an excellent choice...  One thing is that even solo the set-up is about 10 minutes or so even the first time. There were a few moments I thought I could use another hand and wanted the pieces to stay put while I went to the other side and worked on that side... I assume if you buy one of the bigger models then you might actually NEED another person to hold the pole in the pocket or on the key.  All in all this is just what I needed and I think the price is very attractive considering how cheap some products are and this seems quite solid and useful.  And surprisingly light. The convenient bag is a bit bulky though....

As for size; I had a twin size air mattress which nearly covered the entire footprint of the tent. I had just enough room to stow my backpack, helmet, and leather goods.

  Wow, I was super happy with this tent. Took it camping in early August in NH, and it was perfect. Was debating between the 4 and 6-person tent, and so glad I went with the 6-person.  It’s a great size - easily fits a large (tall) queen air mattress with a few feet of room on the side for bags and general human maneuvering. Extremely comfortable for 2 people (but much more room than we technically needed, even with a giant mattress.)Very easy to set up and feels nice and sturdy - I expect it to last for years. No problems with the seams, zippers, etc. The tent stakes are not the best and bend easily if you hit a small rock, but those are easily replaced. (We were fine with them for the first trip but will be buying replacements that are more study and easier to use for the next trip - I suggest to go ahead and just upgrade to better stakes if you’re purchasing this tent. Also get a thick tarp for the bottom for a moisture barrier and to prevent tears from any rocks.)Big note - this is a summer tent. LOTS of ventilation, which is super amazing. But, if the nights are cold, the fact that the entire top is a screen (with a light canopy covering) may leave you wishing you had a warmer blanket.  I probably won’t be using this in the spring/fall unless I bring a very warm sleeping bag.I was able to pack it all back up by myself and fit it back in the nice duffle bag it comes in. Once it was all packed away I saw that there was a way to expand the bag, so it will be even easier next time! :)Highly recommend for family camping. Great price and quality lightweight tent for summer trips.

  Bought this tent a couple years ago. Overall, we've been happy with the tent for car camping. It's easy to erect and quite roomy. There is an O-ring at the apex to hang a lantern, and a decent sized pocket at each of the head and foot walls. Materials feel cheap, but it's a cheap tent and has thus far stood well against fair weather. I was skeptical about its waterproofing because I could see light through a few pint-sized holes along the corners of the basin since day 1. The front zipper gets snagged easily on the weatherproof flap over the lower half of the door, but not that big of a deal.Finally tested it on a rainy weekend and after 2  hours of rain we counted 4 leaks: one each in the lower seams of the two front corners, one mid-way along the main seam of the left wall, and one on the back wall. All leaks originated where the basin contacts the upper material. Only one of the 4 leaks was quite significant, but we had extra towels to soak up the leaks.I wouldn't recommend this tent for rainy weather, such as we have in the PNW, but it's sturdy and roomy for an affordable price. Good as a back-up for us at this point to share when family or friends visit. If you use this, bring a few extra towels to stuff in leaky areas in case of unexpected rain, or use a canopy or tarp cover to reduce contact with water.Overall a good budget starter tent.

  I went camping this past weekend with the boy scouts with this tent. I absolutely love it.  We had winds up to 35 mph, thunder and lightning with heavy rain.  This little tent withstood it all!!  My 9 year old son and I stayed totally dry along with our stuff.  We had heavy winds earlier during the day before the rain and some of the campers tents came up.  When the storm came a few more campers lost their tents to the winds.  A couple of them had to borrow tents for the night because the winds broke their poles and they could not repair them.  This little tent did not budge, it just swayed in the wind. We had a Coleman queen size mattress along with our stuff and we were comfortable.  I DID invest in the campers kit with the heavy duty stakes, a rubber mallet, a tool to get the stakes out of the ground (awesome), and a little broom with a dust pan.  My son and I put the tent up in about 10 minutes easy.  The only thing I would say is it got cold at night and the netting on the sides of the tent let the cool air in, but I like sleeping when it is cold, I just wear more clothes and make sure my son had more clothes on.  It was pretty hot the first day we got there and after setting up the tent, there was plenty of ventilation.  We did not share the tent with any bugs either.

  The Coleman tents have a PE tub floor (PE - waterproof tarp material). You could set this up in a few inches of standing water and still be dry inside. The superior venting  allows vents to be open in the rain without water intrusion. The screened ground-floor vent is large and creates a natural air flow allowing hot air to flow up and out while cool air flows in at the bottom vent. Unadvertised was that the tent (even the 2-person tent) included a stakable mud mat for outside the doorway. Also, a nice Coleman touch was the heavy duty carry bag. Some tents come with a bag that is the same light fabric as the tent, but those do not hold up well to the abrasion that the carry bags endures in handling and storage. The carry bag was also a bit over-sized. Other brands minimize material use by making a carry bag that fits a machine-packed, unused tent. After the first use of those other tents, it is nearly impossible to get the tent back into the carry bag. NOT SO with the Coleman bag. After use, the tent fits back in with no hassle or frustration.

  I did a lot of research for a ‘budget’ tent to get the family interested, and I had an early ‘miss’ with another brand that was so cheap the zip broke on the first day.  I’m so glad I tried this Coleman Sundome.  It’s easy to put up, solidly built, it has a reassuring rainfly ‘roof’ and it’s a great size.  I got the 7’ x 7’ “3 person” version.  We were all so keen to try it out we actually ended up with all 4 of us - two adults and two tweenagers - sleeping in it the first night.  It was a close fit with 4 of us side by side, and not something I’d want to repeat often, but good to know it was possible.  3 people would fit comfortably (we have 3x27” mattress pads side by side) , and 2 would have plenty of room.  I liked it so much I bought the 2 person version also figuring the adults would have the 3-person and the kids could have the 2-person.  For under $100 this is a solid dependable tent.

  Looking for a tent to buy for the camping adventures and well, just in case scenarios..Came with all you need, except for the tent stakes as they seem weak and might break when hitting in hard areas. I would recommend getting sturdier stakes. Easy to set up and break down. Big enough inside to use a queen blow up mattress, as we did with just enough room for other smaller thing inside the tent. Comes with 2 mesh pockets hanging on each ends for smaller storage items. Also 2 sides of the tent have available areas to open up for a screened window and ventilation.  The one thing that bugged me was the zipper for the door kept on snagging on the cover valance in front. Wasn't much of a issue but annoying  just as well. This tent was great for use camping in CA. Nights were chilly but be prepared for that. No rain so could tell if anything leaked, and no condensation formed inside as it sometimes does. The only thing that was frustrating was the f

  Awesome tent! Very easy to set up, took about 5 minutes with 2 people. first night we had 20MPH winds, gusts to 30mph and had no problems. Wind did not blow through the fabric, fly stayed put nicely, and it was roomy for my wife and I.Small ""stuff"" pockets at the head and foot. Ring overhead to hang your light. Has a small zippered access for passing an electric cord through into the tent (we didn't use this feature, but it was nice to see.)I think, for the money, you can't go wrong. Definitely only a 3 season tent, but I would recommend it to anyone just getting into camping or if you only go out from time to time and don't want to make a big investment, only to have it sit in the garage.

  Probably would have been a decent tent. Easy to set up, convenient bag and simple instructions. However, our brand new tent, just out of the box, had a hole in one of the windows, and we were setting up camp at night on an island in a verrry mosquito-friendly national park along the beach. We picked up mosquito netting and made it work with duct tape, but how disappointing for a brand new tent!(And yes, this is why you should always test set up your tent at home before camping, but we didn't get a chance to this time. Live and learn.)Also, the rainfly generally works well, but if any water sneaks under (due to wind) and hits the actual tent itself, the black seams are not waterproof- they will soak through, and slowly drip inside the tent.I expected much better from Coleman. I'm going to see if we can get a refund, but since we did use it for several days (constantly replacing the duct tape/netting) I'm not sure we'll be able to. Will be looking for a new tent.

  SO glad I purchased this tent! Used it for camping twice so far and the second time there was a lot of rain. The inside of our tent was completely dry and had plenty of air flow. What an easy set up much easier then my old and smaller tent! Luckily both times I went I had a friend adult who used to be boy scout and at each camping set up and take down I learned something from both of them about either set up or take down. Even without them this tent was easy to set up and break down. I love the inner pockets one on each side and the two sides that you can zip open and keep the flaps tied up. On my first camping trip it was so awesome to stare out the top and look at the stars. Oh I almost forgot I loved how the silver bottom came up higher inside the tent to keep the rain out. Couldn't be happier with this purchase!!! Highly recommend!

",3.0,Plumpkin,"Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2019","









  
  
    
  It’s easy to assemble. The rain flap isn’t great. Two sides of the tent are open screen with no inner flap to close off the screen so the rain cover is needed for privacy; however, in the rain, the rain cover doesn’t do much. Rain drops in through the open screens. Not fun. If you are only using this in good weather it’s probably fine. We used it for two trips with great weather and then the third trip had rain. We pitched our tent inside a canvas tent on a platform and put up the rain fly and figured we’d be good. The canvas tent had a slow leak at the seams and it fell on the rain fly, and then dropped into our tent right where the storage pockets hang so our cardboard box of playing cards was soaked. Luckily we were on cots so only one for got wet and we were off the floor. I would hate to see how wet the inside of the tent would have gotten if we had not been inside another tent.

  Despite the Coleman promotional video showing how sturdy this tent is with wind, our 6-person tent (which fits 4 comfortably) barely lasted a night.Our tent poles snapped in 15-20mph wind. Camp staff came by beforehand saying it would be mildly windy but extra tent stakes should suffice. While other tents were fine in the wind, ours bent back and forth, eventually snapping completely. We ended up leaving our camping trip early to go home.Overall, disappointed with the tent quality. We'll toss and buy from REI instead.

  I've had the opportunity to use this two times, and I am pleasantly surprised at the quality and features.  Compared to tents at REI costing 3x as much, this is a quality bargain. Tent assembly is easy, without needing to refer to the directions (which are attached to the carrying bag.  All of the needed parts were included, and there were several extra spikes included as well.  The spikes are cheap metal that bend fairly easy, and I think I will probably need to purchase better ones in the near future.  The tent poles are composite and shock corded together, just like the more expensive brands. It sleeps two 6' people comfortably with space in the center for storage.  Nice touches are the mat that is used to keep debris out of the tent, the two pouches inside that keep phones and valuables handy, and the center strap to hold a small LED lantern.  The two times it has been used includes episodes of torrential downpours, and the tent kept the water out both from the top, and from the bottom.  The rain cover can be pulled out a little to aid in air flow, but it still gets hot in the Florida/Georgia summer.  There is no way around that. Disassembly is easy......if you pay attention to how it came out.  I think I have it now, but the first time trying to get to back into the carrying case was a chore.  I am looking at the next larger size to use when we go camping out west next spring break.

    Not good if you camp where it's cool at night
  
",3.0,zootrainer,"Reviewed in the United States September 1, 2019","









  
  
    
  This tent has several mesh panels at the top, but there is no nylon cover over them that can be zipped shut (like most tents have). So when it gets cold at night, that air comes straight into the tent. (And by ""cold"" I mean 50-60F, not like I was using the tent in the Arctic.) I could feel it swirling down around my head even without a breeze outside. Even my Lab was cold. And it didn't make any difference when I left the rainfly sides down flat against the tent. I guess I have to bring some kind of blanket to put over the tent and under the rainfly.Also, on the third outing, the elastic broke on the rainfly pole set as I was inserting them (or it came loose from one end, not sure yet), so now nothing holds the set together. I don't think I can rethread it because the inside diameter of the pole is so small.I don't camp often, maybe only twice a year, so these things aren't horrible deal breakers for me. I can throw an extra blanket in the car to keep the mesh panels covered. I can fiddle with the rainfly poles even without the elastic in place. The point is that I shouldn't have to.

    Coleman - 2 tablespoons of water of fail QC?
  
",4.0,Keith,"Reviewed in the United States October 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  This should have failed the Coleman claim that a new tent would only have at most 2 tablespoons of water leak in or it would fail the QC test.  FAILI spray waterproofed the tent before using it (I don't trust manufactures claims).  I did not seal the seams based on Colemans claim.  Each corner on the bottom/side has small pin prick holes. It rained all night and each corner leaked. (maybe 2 tablespoons per corner)  I put a cloth in each corner and that was enough to stop it but certainly need to seal it better.The Positives:I like how the rain cover sticks out over the door. I did not get rain in from sides or top. Rainy weather was for 12hrs nonstop at around 55 degrees Fahrenheit.  I also used the tent in a low of 45 degrees Fahrenheit. Side windows were zipped shut and rain cover was pulled down tight along sides.Have not used in warmer weather but think that with windows open and rain cover loose would be fine.  Certainly with it off the side screen panels would give plenty of ventilation.  Wish the sides had zip up window covers like the front and back.Tent was easy to setup.  It fit my sleeping bag laying side to side but it was edge to edge. I could have my gear inside with me and able to maneuver around OK.  For two people, you better be quite intimate with the other person and not plan on keeping gear inside with you.

  I'm not going to lie, I was a little apprehensive about the quality of this tent for the price but it had nothing but good reviews and I see why. I used this for 9 days in the UP of Michigan where we had warn days, cold nights, and a patch of heavy thunderstroms for 3 days straight. With a tarp underneath it kept us dry during the rain and comfortable during our daytime naps. The four person tent is really only big enough to fit two comfortably, which is what we planned for. We used a queen blow up mattress inside and that didn't leave much room for extras so we kept our bags in the car and only brought one backpack inside with us each night. We stayed in there for just about 2 days straight during the heavy rains and it was tall enough to sit up and play cards with a good few feet above our heads. The set up only takes about ten minutes to do really well, five minutes if you're experience and are throwing it up quick to get out of the rain. The bag it comes in can even be expanded if you dont fold it back up as it came. The only complaint I have is that the original stakes it comes with are flimsy and kind of stink. I would recommend buying some thinker, hearty stakes but overall, I highly recommend this tent. I'm not sure you can get much better, especially for the price

    Worst $50 car-camping tent
  
",2.0,Sally,"Reviewed in the United States October 9, 2020","









  
  
    
  Obviously this is a car camping tent, so it needs to provide shelter and be comfortable enough.There are a few good things about this tent:- The size of the footprint. I fit a full/double size blow up mattress in here comfortable, with some extra room at the foot/head to stash extra items. I did try a queen sized mattress and it definitely would not fit, so don't go with a queen size.- The tent is tall enough to not feel cramped when you're sitting up inside it, but that's about it in terms of comfort.- The price. Super cheap.It did provide some shelter from a light rain one night, but I don't think it would hold up or stay dry during a serious amount of rain.The bad:I think the biggest flaw is also the reason why it sucked so bad to sleep in for a week-long car camping trip: the tall, dome design is about as far from aerodynamic as you can get. During windy nights this tent strains and shakes and the fly waves no matter how tightly you stake it down. While the tent probably isn't going to fall over or un-stake, it is incredibly noisy. I am a light sleeper but my partner is not and it tortured both of us every night with the amount of noise it made.If you can guarantee you'll get a still, wind-less night it might be ok, but under no circumstances should you camp in the desert with this thing.

  Was going on some weekend car camping trips with friends and family.  My 2 nephews needed a tent and i looked and found this for a decent price.  Almost chose the @ person tent.  But, I currently have another 2p tent and for me alone it is a little snug when I put my pack and gear in with me.  So, I selected the 3p version...best choice ever.  Set up was not complicated, infact my nephews put it up themselves  in just a few minutes.  My 2 nephews fit comfortably and they even had room for their packs and some gear.  Its by no means a minimalist tent but,  it only weighed 2-3 lb. packed.  In the interior, there is a loop at the center to hang a lamp.  It also has 2 storage pockets for gear.  Since it's the middle of summer, I cant say much about how weather proof it is.  But, it did well against the occasional  water spray.  It also came with a  small tarp to be used like a door mat.  One short fall was that it didn't come with a footprint tarp.  But, I  easily fixed that with a spare one I had in my gear bin.  Only used this tent a couple times this summer and it performed well on our weekend trips.  Overall, gave it four stars because of the price at the time and it performed well for what we needed.  Would purchase again if I need another.  Thanks

  This tent is pretty big and easy to set up. The canopy top seems to provide excellent rain and sun protection. When the canopy cover is off, there is a net to protect you from bugs and falling leaves or tree debris and provides an excellent view of the stars. There is only one entrance with a back opening for ventilation. It comes with stakes which are low quality. I bent two of the 6 provided stakes in my first time setting this up. I would recommend purchasing additional stakes that are stronger. It doesn't roll up to be very compact which is expected. This is a perfect tent to go camping with a group or a casual hike in to a site but I would recommend something smaller and more compact for serious backpacking trips.

I was a bit worried about the rain fly only covering the top half though. Turns out my worries were valid. Upon setup i noticed a few holes due to mis-stitching near the zipper, I think they were seam sealed, but still, being able to see through small holes in your tent where it’s supposed to be waterproof is a bit unnerving. The first two days of our camping trip it rained pretty much nonstop. Water seeped in at all 4 corners. Luckily it wasn’t a lot of water and it didn’t spread too much before I was able to soak it up with a towel. I was hoping the tent would fair better on its first go around,  but I guess you get what you pay for. I’d like to return the tent but I just missed the return window :/

Carrying bag is nice to have but it takes a little effort to get everything back in the bag.  Not serious enough to get it back in the bag.Later that night there was some heavy rain and we stayed dry; nice.  Because of the difficulties we did have, I cannot recommend this for anything more heavy than car camping, but this is plenty good enough for car camping.

  I bought this tent as something more roomy and less expensive than a backpacking tent to use for car camping. This tent works great, it is the perfect size for two people and their stuff, three works but it is a little more cosy. I am 5'7"" and this tent is tall enough to sit upright, not tall enough to stand in, but I can get dressed and get in and out without too much bending. I did waterproof the seams when I got it, and it has lasted several rainstorms with out me getting wet or the tent collapsing.  The inside of the tent does not get much condensation. It is very easy to set up and take down by yourself, and does not need to be staked if you are camping on slickrock. With the rainfly on the tent stays warm enough for late season adventures, without the rainfly you get a nice breeze. The mesh parts of the tent are not really fine enough to see the stars through, but if I really wanted to see the stars I would go outside, so that doesn't really matter to me. For me this has been the perfect tent and has survived many adventures so far without any issues, so I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a small car camping tent.

  My husband and I (mostly I) decided we wanted to try out camping. It was going to be for me, my husband and our 2-year old daughter. After looking at reviews of other tents I decided to go with this one since I figured it would give us enough space. I wasn't expecting much from the tent but since it was our first time ever camping I didn't want to invest a large amount of money in a tent in case we didn't like camping. Our first night camping we chose the worst campsite. As planner I take full responsibility for it as I chose a spot that was high in a mountain, slanted and winds got as high as 50mph throughout the night. There were several times throughout the night where I woke up and thought the wind was going to blow the tent away. There were times that the tent would bow inward as it couldn't take the strong wind coming at it, but then it would straighten up again when the wind gust would pass. The second night we moved to a different campsite and had zero problems with wind. The tent was able to fit our sleeping bags and even give us a little bit of room to fit our shoes and baggage to the side. It has two little pouches that hang on each side that are great to hang our keys and pepper spray. We have just returned from our second camping trip and are both officially satisfied with the tent. The instructions are attached to the bag so you can't lose them and the first set up is the only one that is a bit confusing (if you've never set up a tent like me). After the first time though it is very easy to set up and takes no more then 15 minutes for my husband and I to set up the tent at a leisurely pace. The only reason I give it four starts instead of five is because of the stakes that come with the tent. Our first time camping we didn't think to buy stakes or a rubber mallet (our fault). We used a rock to pushed the stakes in the ground and they bent like crazy. The ground we were camping in was not very rough so I was surprised that they bent. The second time around we bought a mallet and some extra stakes. When we tried to use the old stakes with the rubber mallet (the ones that were not bent) they still bent. My husband picked up a stake and bent it with his two hands. So, overall I think this is a great tent for beginners but I would recommend buying separate stakes.  Also for our second trip we ended up buying a queen air mattress (toddlers do not share sleeping bags very well) and it fit nicely in the tent and still gave us space to put our shoes and baggage to the side. We are officially happy campers. We are planning on taking a road trip to the west coast from Texas in October and are going to camp at any forest/national park as we go and have no intention of moving up in tent. This one meets all of our needs and also doesn't take much space in the car when packed up.

  We slept through a literal hurricane this past weekend. It was the first time using the tent. I was worried about taking it on a camping trip without setting it up prior, but I did and it was fine. All pieces were in tact and had no issues. It rained the second night, no moisture in the tent so happy about that. Then we had about 40 mph winds all through the night into the morning until taking it down. We didn't stake the cover in unfortunately, but it held on tight and never left the tent. I am very happy with this purchase. The tent is a great size. It was just 2 of us in a large queen size air mattress. All of our stuff fit in the tent with us, I could stand up no issues (I am 5'4"") and we had room to place a towel down to wipe our feet. Great tent!

  All product review should be based off of expectations, and this tent certainly fulfilled my expectations with one particular exception.I admit that I’m new to camping,  but I did not realize that a two person tent really is for one person and all of their luggage/equipment. A four person tent, however, is used for two people and their equipment/luggage. So, if you’re interested in taking someone along on your camping adventure I would highly recommend getting a four person tent and not the two person tent. This, I suppose, it’s common knowledge in the camping world. I can’t hold the tent accountable to my lack of experience.With that being said, my camping buddy and I were not desperate for space. It was tight, albeit manageable.If you’re looking for a nice, reliable, easy to set up and easy to store a tent for the occasional camping trip, looking no further. You can’t beat the price and you can’t beat the quality.

    Good Motorcycle Camping Tent.
  
",4.0,Sagebrush,"Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2019","









  
  
    
  Needed a tent small enough to pack on a motorcycle (BMW GS 1150) that is easy to assemble, relatively small to pack, and roomy enough for one person and gear.  Very satisfied.Tent assembles with two poles inserted into sleeves crossed at center.  Generally works well, but clips are faster and easier to use than sleeves.  Base of poles connects to tent via small pegs, which works pretty well but not as well as inserting  tipped ends of the pole into a grommet as on an older Spaulding I have.  Tent can be assembled and used w/o pegs, one of the reasons I chose it.  Tent can be moved when assembled.  Tents requiring pegs for assembly are a serious hassle and make some camping sites difficult or impossible to use.  Windows and door work very well.  Blue and gray color scheme attractive.  Inner pouches very handy as is hooking point at top center.  Easy to roll up,  pack, and fit into bag (included).Although listed as 5' X 7', my tent is several inches shorter.  I'm 6' 3"" and need to sleep diagonally to keep my head, feet, and pillow away from the walls.  Would be easier to use if length was actually 7'.Have no experience with rain or severe weather, so can't comment on waterproofing etc.  I sealed all seams before use just in case.In summary, excellent value, well designed and constructed, and length shortcoming is manageable.  I enjoy using this tent.

  I purchased this tent largely based on the number of reviews, which at the time was 4.5 stars, the size, and that it had a rain fly. It was pretty easy to setup alone, but needs two people to raise the tent once the poles are inserted. This review is after one week end of camping in Colorado at 8000 ft, 85 degrees during the day, and 48 degrees at night. I’ll update after the next.Pros:1. Hook inside on top, to hang a lightweight LED light.2. Side pockets to store smaller items.3. Pretty easy to setup.4. Price was good at almost $100Cons:1. Two sides have large non-zipping screens, air can freely flow through the tent. The first night we used it we were extremely cold, our feet and head were freezing in the middle of the night. I expected a bit more insulation, and our sleeping bags were not rated for really cold weather. I didn’t realize there was no way to seal up the sides for cold nights, a HUGE flaw in my opinion. The rain fly sits away from the tent when staked, so you can’t trap any warm air inside. Our 2nd and 3rd night camping, I removed the rain fly stakes to let the fly rest loosely against the mesh sides, and this helped a bit - however, had is been rainy or windy we’d have had a different problem.2. My wife was hooking one of the tent side hooks to the poles, and the base of it partially ripped away from the tent. I imagine those hooks will wear out rather quickly considering how easily the sewing ripped.3. It seems like small rocks on the ground have almost penetrated the flooring near the entrance. We alway take our shoes off before entering, so I thought this was odd. I’m curious how this will hold up over time, and if we’ll get holes.4. After handling the fiberglass poles, I got fiberglass splinters in 2 fingers. I’ve started only grabbing the metal parts when I can. This may be totally normal, but just reporting my findings here.5. We bought the 6 person version, and I can’t imagine 6 people sleeping in this tent. I could probably sleep 20+ babies in there, but let’s be real. We slept 4 wide, with some smaller bags at our feet, and that filled the tent. I’d layout your sleeping bags and see what’s realistic for how many you could fit inside.Overall I’d say this tent is ok. I had thought buying a tent with the Coleman name on it would be a safe bet, but I’m not very impressed with this one. With that being said, it was $100, so you get what you pay for.Update Aug 23, 2020:We took this tent to a lake on the plains. Day temp 98, low of 60. We were much more comfortable this time, of course it was pretty hot, and it didn't cool off quickly at night. The tent was just what we needed for this hot weather, and our second time using this tent was even quicker to setup. If only the sides zipped up, that might help with cooler temperatures. No complaints this trip.

  This tent is easy to set up and tear down. It's perfect for 2 people using a queen size air mattress. I'm sure if you had a dog it would be fine as well, plenty of floor space with your gear. Have spent several 4 day weekends and a few week long trips in this tent since we bought it in July 2017. This past summer had a huge rainstorm move through an that was the first time we noticed the tent leaked through the rain fly, not exactly sure if it was the seams or just that we haven't waterproofed it since we bought it. Threw a tarp over the top and tied it down with a few ropes and the leak stopped, but again this was a hard rain for about half an hour. Looking to upgrade soon though because with the air mattress in it you can't stand up completely, if that is important for you

  Whelp... we went camping for 4 days and it rained during one of them. The bottom right at the seam leaked. We put packing tape around it to lessen the amount that entered the tent. Also by morning the back wall on the inside was very wet (not condensation). Had we paid more than what we did for the tent we would be mad. In this case, I feel like it was a risk for buying a lesser expensive tent. On a positive note, it stands up to wind very well. One day was extremely windy. Hearing the wind blow through the rainfly was a little annoying because it made a ""flarpy"" buzzing noise. We closed the sides of the rainfly on a cold (48degree) night and the tent stayed pretty nice temp-wise.Through rain, wind, cold and sun (all in 4 days - yay New England), this tent stood up to all but the rain.

I can't say how it feel to sleep in 3, but 2 people + 2 backpacks (one being very big) is totally fine. Very tall people (around 6""2 or more) will probably have space issues, I am 5""7 and I fit nicely.Good things: the look is very nice, the materials seems to be of a good quality also. Very easy to setup, I like the rainfly (I didn't have the chance to test it, though) and the 2 small pockets that hand on 2 sides (very useful to place handy stuff such as a small torch, smartphone, car keys, etc.).What lacks: a hook on the center-top of the tent would be very useful.

  I'm not one to write reviews very often, but I figured this tent deserved it. I purchased this tent days before going camping because i wanted something fairly compact and waterproof. It is definitely compact when stored. It is held in a soft case that doesnt take up much room at all.What I really want to discuss though is its ability to repel water. We took a risk and didn't purchase any waterproofing spray. The second day of camping it began to rain. And it didn't stop. From noon on saturday to an hour before we packed midday sunday, it poured. Thunderstorm after thunderstorm, a tree nearby us actually fell down. But i remained dry. I woke up at one point in the night in what felt like a waterbed. The ground underneath was completely saturated, and i was on a puddle. But i remained dry. I woke up the next morning to more rain, but the inside of this tent never got even damp.While i wouldn't test this poor tent out by doing the same thing again without waterproofing spray, I can say that 24 hours of straight pouring rain did nothing to this tent, and I am extremely happy with my purchase. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a small tent who wants to stay dry in the worst conditions.

I’m pretty disappointed since Coleman is the brand. I know it wasn’t crazy expensive but it wasn’t free either and quite a lot cheaper at Walmart for what I assume can’t be worse quality.

  The Tent:This tent is a 2 season tent, which I did not see listed anywhere on the seller page. This means it will NOT keep you warm when it is windy or near freezing temperatures. The rainfly did keep us dry while it rained, however the cold winds blasted through this tent. Arizona and Utah are surprisingly cold in April. Apart from this, the tent is very big. Enough for 3 sleeping bags with no room for shoes, or for 2 sleeping bags and a little area to put a case of water (so the tent doesn't fly away), firewood (so other campers don't steal it), backpacks, clothes, shoes and other muddy/sandy stuff.Set up/ Take down:The set up is surprisingly fast. Just insert the rods, tie down the rain fly, and the stakes and you're done. It took us amateurs around 5 minutes. take down was longer (15-20min), as it was windy and you have to get the giant tent back into a tiny bag. I do highly recommend having a tarp underneath, to give you an additional barrier to keep out the cold ground.Other Info:You can bring this on a plane... in checked luggage.It's very light.. like 8 pounds, but feels like 5 pounds.The carrying case/bag is small and has a handle and a good zipper...holds everything in. The stakes and poles come in separate bags insidethe carrying case, and there is a mud flap thing (which we didn't use). TL;DR: Not suitable for winter or cold spring/fall evenings. Can travel in checked luggage. Spacious for 2 to 3 people.10 out of 10 would camp again.

  I bought this tent 6 years ago. Literally. Never used it once. It's just been sitting in its little bag in the corner of my garage. In the last month, I've used it twice. Once in the mountains and once in the desert. To be clear I have the 4 person version. I used the fly in the mountains and without the fly in the desert. There was no rain or horrible weather on either trips. A little windy in the desert. The tent is tall enough that it acts like a sail so I would say it isnt sturdy or good in the wind. I left the fly off specifically to help let the wind pass through the tent. It probably would have been a rough night if i put the fly on. Make sure you stake it down well. The stakes that come with it are a joke. Buy some separately with a mallet and you will be happy you did. I fit a double size air mattress in here and still had a couple feet off the side to put gear. I'm 6'3 and had plenty of room when laid out. You c as n stand up if you are hunched over. It's pretty easy to set up. Overall, I'm happy with the tent for a very basic car camping tent. The price is a great value.

  These are way smaller than advertised. I mean you could sit as many people in there.

The wind was so strong that the tent would fold over entirely during gusts that would last for 10 second. But it popped right back up every single time. And the inside of the tent was bone dry. Even though we had standing water outside, and flooding.It's dinky and small but it held up to weather I figured we'd be sleeping in the car for. I don't know how many trips like that it'll last on.

  My wife and I were going hunting and needed a tent to sleep in. We don't go camping too often but wanted something that was easy to set up and take down so we can take it other places with us. This tent fit the bill pretty well. Its less expensive as a lot of other tents that offer the same amenities. My wife and I have generally found that two person tents can barely fit two people, and when its hot outside it not comfortable at all. So we got the 3 person tent which was just little more expensive. There is room for some of our stuff on the sides and a good amount of room for us to sleep. I am 6'3'' and I fit in this tent well. If you are camping at a KOA or a place that has electrical outlets than there is a nice electrical flap on this tent to put a power cord through. What I like the most in this tent is the ventilation system. There are nice vents on the top half of the tent but on hot nights you need something more. So on this tent there is a base vent that can be opened with a zipper. This brings cool are from the bottom and helps push hot air from the top. Definitely a plus in my book.I think this is a great tent if you go camping sometimes or on occasions. Nothing too fancy but it still nice enough to sleep in and feel good in the morning. If you are thinking about hiking around a bit wth this tent you may want to choose a lighter tent that is made for backpacking. This tent is light but not something you want to carry around in you pack all day hiking.

  Works well as a basic tent. Replaced an older tent with this one. Husband and I tested it before our family camping trip: the tent is spacious and easily fit two adults plus a dog, dog’s sleeping bag, and two 45L backpacks. Regarding water resistance, it did rain and we did get wet. Rain drops seeped in the roof of the tent and plopped on our heads but we didn’t get soaked—just a few drops plopped down on us. Our sleeping bags kept us from getting soaked. Body heat resulted in condensation collecting on the inside tent walls so when I happened to touch the sides of the tent with my sleeping bag, the bag got wet. There’s a way to deal with this issue but I haven’t gotten to that yet.

  I was looking for a lightweight tent which was actually big enough for two adults and their gear. I also wanted something with good air flow to avoid condensation, and most importantly waterproof with a large rain fly. This tent delivered. You can fit two adults and gear comfortably, even though if the one on the inside needs out you'll have to crawl over the other but I can live with that. Too fancy is often too heavy and even a small, one person 4.8lb tent will kill your arm adventually. The floor vent helps along with the fact that the tent poles keep the large rain fly from resting on the top screens, which with the guy lines, works perfectly. The weight when I first received it was surprisingly more than I wanted but once I unpacked it and threw away the heavy cardboard box it came in it seemed more like the advertised weight.  I also hit this tent with one can of waterproofing to be on the safe side and since the tent is a medium sized tent, one can was only enough to do one quick coat below the rainfly, along the seams twice and a quick spritz to the rain fly seams. Well, it just rained heavily and i can say with content that not one drop has leaked in anywhere! It feels like a regular tarp material floor so if you're camping on a rough or gravelly surface you may want a foot print to be safe, but I'm on rough cut field grass with some thick stalks and I've had no trouble with strength or leakthrough. I went with the green for light and I love how bright it is inside. I'm 5'8 and can stand bent over which is useful for pulling on pants in privacy but I keep knocking my head on The lantern I hung from the center loop. The window and door open below the rain fly so there's no need to worry if you want them wide open as well. I must say I really like this tent.

  Like others have said this tent is nice for somebody that doesn’t want to spend a lot of money on a tent and that isn't going to use it on a regular basis. I purchased it for RAGBRAI last year and it worked  great. I had plenty of room and was even able to put my bike inside the tent with me at night.We had had a storm one night and the tent kept me dry, but while taking the tent down I noticed one of the fiberglass poles had splintered.  I contacted Coleman, and after jumping through all of their hoops to get this covered under the one year warranty, this is the reply that I received:Your pole was damaged due to the wind. Wind damage is not covered under warranty so you will have to purchase the replacement kits.Thank you,Coleman.Since the replacement parts will cost almost half the price of the tent, I’ll probably just purchase a new tent of a different brand that has aluminum poles.  So if you purchase this tent, just know going in thatyou may have a hard time obtaining any kind of warranty from Coleman.

  We LOVE this tent. And apparently so does everyone else. Every campground we went to has atleast 2 other people w the same exact tent. I can see why, though. It works great! We are novice campers and were able to put this puppy up in less than 10 min. It is SO easy. Lightweight and also compact. My sleeping mat took up more room than the tent bag. Before using, I water proofed it and seam sealed it. Glad I did. In our 2 wk camping trip, we went through 100 degrees down to 22 degrees. We went through excessive heat, rain storms, windstorms, dust storms, and snow. It handled it all like a champ. We like the 2 mesh pockets inside for little things like our headlamps, keys, etc. The only thing I wish it had were a couple loops to hang light stuff inside.

  So let's talk about coleman's water resistance first. It is water resistant for the first couple minutes. If it happens to rain all night, plan on sleeping in your bathing suit. My sleeping spot happened to be in a slight unnoticeable bowl in the ground and I, and all my blankets and sleeping bag, were completely flooded out. Water came up through the floor and down from the ceiling. It is easy to put up, even if you only have one person. It looks nice. Cool colors. If you plan on camping in anywhere except the Sahara desert, you may want to invest in some waterproofing spray and spray the heck out of it. Just as a side note, customer service doesnt care if your tent floods because it is ""water resistant"" and not ""water proof"".

  This is a basic Coleman tent for occasional summer camping. It looks nice, but can take water if it rains long enough. This is without saying not a backpacker tent but is suitable for Cub Scout or car camping. The room and head space in the middle is decent and the floor space works as described if you are careful with what you bring in. The poles seem to break and the fabric tears over a few seasons, but if you are gentle and dry it out before putting it away it should be worth the money. If you are looking for something more lightweight or durable look for a higher price point brand as Coleman is for basic car camping use where you do not have to carry it far.

  Does not hold up to wind.  On the second ever use, we came back to camp after a day of hiking to find that our tent had been blown away with all of our sleeping bags and gear still inside it.  The tent pole corner holders had ripped out of 3/4 corners.  All the stakes that we used were heavy duty external metal stakes, and those were bent and ripped out of the ground with the tent and rain guard still attached.  The rain guard acted like a parachute and a gust of wind propelled it into heavy force which destroyed the tent.On the box it says ""wind-tested"".  It failed the test.That was a very cold night at camp without a tent.  Be careful purchasing this if you plan on camping anywhere where there could be wind.

  A pole broke the first time we set this up.  Coleman was not very responsive.  When they did respond, they said to return it to Amazon because it was within the return period.  It wasn't Amazon's fault the pole broke, so we chose not to take that route.  The tent is a nice size, but will likely only be a good fit for warm weather camping.  This is not a quality item nor does it live up to the Coleman name.  We could have gotten the same quality in a cheap box-store brand tent - disappointed!

  This tent is great and kept us dry through a heavy rainfall:-easy to assemble. I was a first-timer and it took about 15 minutes mainly because I was being cautious  about breaking the poles-this is advertised as roomy enough to fit a queen size air matress but i strongly advise against it. I don't see how that can be true based on my experience inside that tent. It would even be a tight squeeze with a full-sized mattress unless you plan to get onto the bed from outside. you wouldn't even be able to get into the tent to get on the bed.- 2 people can sleep comfortably in this tent and there is a little room for necessities but you couldn't pile all your belongings in this tent. this will be good for 1 person with a backpack or 2 car campers.- the rainfly was super tight and we had a hard time getting the b pole through the pocket sleeves, and the strap connecting one of the hooks broke.- the tent stayed warm enough once we closed the ventilation flap but the tent roof is netted so keep that in mind. The rain fly goes over the netting and protects from rain but if it gets chilly enough it could present a challenge. consider bringing a tarp with you that you can tape over the netting.I recommend inspecting your tent before use as I noticed a small defect when I was setting up the tent.

  Got this on sale so, I'd say this was well worth the money.  I bought it for a week long bike tour, so it got taken down and set up quite a bit without issue.  We had a pretty good storm blow through one night that blasted us with a good downpour and high gusts.  Tent held up well and kept us dry.However, the pole fiberglass feels cheap... like they won't take long to wear out or break... fabric seems thin and seams will probably leak after a few uses... the stakes are useless.. bend easy in hard soil and spin in the ground releasing whatever guy line is attached.You probably could hit it with some waterproofing spray and buy a set of better poles and stakes and you'd get a few more years out of it.  But... if you're THAT serious about camping.. you should probably be investing in a quality tent.This tent would be good for kids.. or the occasional camping party where you're not too concerned if it gets trashed.

  This is a really great tent, especially for the price! The quality is just like any other Coleman tent, and it is super spacious and very practical with the screened in porch. We had a queen air bed and a dog in the tent with plent more room for storage, totes, bags, etc. The screened porch would easily fit 3 regular sized lawn chairs, just be careful dragging them along the floor of the porch. The only downfalls were that the fly was missing one guy line (not a huge deal, as the fly still did its job) and dirt/sand tends to collect in the porch and if it gets wet can be mud central (we found making a conscious effort to take shoes off outside helped a lot! The tent is super easy to set up, I did it myself but a second person always makes it even easier and the bag for the tent is big enough to get everything back in with not too much fuss!

If you're going to be camping somewhere flat, windy, and sandy, invest in longer stakes. Easy to set up and tear down with one person.

  For the price, this seems like a pretty solid tent. It was easy to setup, fairly spacious inside, packed up easily enough, and doesn't take up a ton of room. There's a couple inside pockets for storage and a lantern clip on the ceiling. The front and back windows can be zipped up, but the side windows can't and the back vent can't be closed. I didn't realize this until I went camping and the nights were a bit cool as a result. However, you can adjust the rain cover stakes so it's pulled down as close to the windows and vent as possible to minimize airflow. Overall, the construction feels durable enough that it should survive a few seasons and I'm reasonably satisfied with the purchase.

  I bought this tent in the summer of 2020 to gain some distance from my parents who I still live with with my partner.  We are both in our late twenties and so its nice to have some space.  Its a good tent, though I don't see how it could even sleep four incredibly skinny adults.  Three very close friends would be a stretch, as it barely fits our Queen size air mattress.  However there's enough room at the bottom of the tent to stow my partner's bow, arrows quiver, our hiking bag and two backpacks.  The main downside is that there are no side pockets and the two overhead pockets are at either end of the tent.  I put a flashlight in one of the pockets and cracked my head against it three times in the night when I rolled over and forgot it was there.  It also gets hot during the day, but at night it gives a great view of the stars.  I live in California and its been in the 90's for the past several days, I have to get up at nine, otherwise its way too hot inside of the tent.  I have not yet put on the rainfly, nor has it been through the rain, truthfully we'd most likely pack it up before having be pelted with rain.  It blew over once, when we left for a few days and left only the mattress and sleeping bag inside it.  However I live in an area with high winds by the ocean and so that may have something to do with it blowing over.

  You cannot beat the price! I recently used the tent for a three night backpacking trip. The setup is easy and the tent had decent air flow when the flaps were open with the main door zipped up. I will say that the poles do add a good amount of weight to my pack. The tent itself is not too bad with weight, but other than water and maybe food, it is definitely the heaviest item in my pack. As for room, it is listed as a 2-person tent, which you could probably pull off, but there won't be much room. I am 5'11 and found myself having to sleep corner to corner to prevent my feet and head from touching the sides. There is a good amount of height inside, but I'd gladly sacrifice a few inches in height for more floor space.

  Great camping tent for beginners. It's nothing extremely fancy, but for the price you can't go wrong.Comfortably sleeps two people for a weekend trip - three people may be a little cramped inside with personal gear and supplies.Ventilation is nice with the floor vent. The floor is also like a 'tub' made out of a durable tarp. In theory, the tent could sit in an inch or two of water and you'd still be dry inside. The only downfall I didn't like about the tent is there is only a single zippered entrance. Had there been a door on each side, it would make it much easier for two people to maneuver inside without disturbing the other.In a nutshell, it's a great tent for beginners or even the weekend warrior. I think you'd get many years of general use out of the tent. I would recommend the purchase.

We went back inside and could not find any leaks so for minor rains I can safely say it worked. Love this tent and would definitely bring it with us to our next adventure!

  My wife and I probably have 50+ nights in our tent so far and we still love it.  It's dry and fast and easy to setup for two people (it'd be a struggle for one person.)  This is our third Coleman tent and I haven't yet found any reason other than weight to buy any other brand.  As we're mostly car campers, it'd perfect for us.  As a car camper, I'd also say that the 6-person rating is a bit unrealistic certainly if you want to be comfortable or keep any luggage in your tent with you.  Our first tent for just the two of us was a 4 person (6ft by 10 ft) and we found it too small.  Our second Coleman wasn't vented through (window in the back and door in the front) and we found it overly stuffy for summer camping although great in the late season.

  First time using the tent was over a rainy weekend.  It was intermittent rain, heavy a few times but only for a few minutes.  During the night i noticed my sleeping bag felt a little damp down by my feet and thats when i woke up and pretty much water was seeping in through the material all around the lower 1/4 part of the tent. Not enough to pool on the inside but if you touched it, it was wet all around.  I don't normally go camping and i only needed it for this one weekend so it was good enough considering the price.  If you camp often and need it to be water proof this may not be the right choice.

  I love this tent. Fast & easy to put up and take down and keep clean.  I use it for one person, and it fits the coleman comfortsmart deluxe cot, with plenty of additional floor space remaining. Compared to buying a pad or air mattress plus sleeping bag, the cot costs less, and uses normal sheets and blankets from the house, so no cost there.  The mesh/screen top of the tent gives you good ventilation, and the rain fly gives you privacy plus rain cover. I put seam seal on all the seams before first use, and this tent withstood a HARD rain storm staying 100% dry inside.  On a later trip, I put up the tent under a pop-up canopy, and left off the rain fly, and also went through a super-hard thunderstorm, with good results.

  This is a decent starter tent at an affordable price. However, product page is misleading, as the graphics indicate that this tent was manufactured to include Coleman's ""Dark Room Technology"". This was something that sold me on this initially, as I am a light sleeper. The green Coleman Sundome 4-Person tent does NOT include this technology. It is not listed on the packaging and this tent lights up considerably even early in sunrise. That can be disappointing if you are looking for a tent that will help you sleep in. Otherwise, as long as you stake this tent down correctly, it is rather durable. The tent did go through some significant wind and collapsed in without the rain fly staked in to support it. Durability is questionable if using the tent alone. With all parts utilized and secured, this tent did hold  excellently. I am disappointed by the lack of light blocking but the tent did provide us a comfortable first weekend camping with it.

I didn’t even mind leaving it up for a couple weeks so the kids could sleep in it and feel like they were on vacation. My kids are 5 and 11 so there was a lot of zipping and inspiring and thankfully this tent seems tough and the zipper is good quality and can withstand the coming’s and goings of children! Great pricing for what I was looking for and we will continue using this for indoor fun!

  We are going on a camping trip very soon, and the only thing we have tent-wise is a monstrous 8-person apparatus that is >10 years old... We were concerned about the water-tight nature of the tent, so we decided that maybe it was time to look for something new.This tent comes in three pieces of water impervious fabric. The fabric is VERY thin, but this likely helps a lot in terms of weight. The instructions are sewn to the bag, and are water resistant as well, which is a very nice touch.While putting this together was pretty easy once we realized what the heck we were supposed to do, the instructions didn't have enough instruction, enough photos, and worst of all seemed kind of incomplete. For example, there's a rectangular piece that is not referenced at all in the instructions, so our honest guess is that this is for our shoes to take off at night to not get the inside of the tent dirty? This is a total guess, though.The poles were extremely night because they have a string in the middle that are taught that snaps the poles together quickly and easily. The tent looks great once it's up, however it definitely isn't going to win any awards for sturdiness - a few good winds I anticipate having to buy a new tent in the end.We're hoping for good weather so none of this matters, but it's just something to think about during your purchase.

As with any family that camps, we have a ton of Coleman products; stove, bbq, tents, flashlights, lanterns, coolers, etc. Most have been solid products that last. This new tent simply will not last.Easy to set up. And clear from the instant you feel the material, the quality has gone down. Thinner and feels as if it will easily rip. There is a weather flap covering the main door’s zipper which is impossible not to snag every time you close the zipper. No joke, it gets stuck on the material every single time we open or close the tent. There is an air vent near the floor which doesn’t close, always open. Makes no sense. And lastly, there are two internal mesh pockets for your gear. One ripped first day we used the tent.Won’t deter me from purchasing other Coleman products, but done with their tents.

I noticed this hole as I was putting up the tent for its second time use.  I expected more for a $90 tent not even being used in the outside elements.

You have to sacrifice some air flow for the rain fly. The hanging pouches on the inside were super convenient. There was an extra piece of material, like a 1x2 foot tarp, I’m not sure exactly what it was for but it came in handy. We used it outside the tent to sit on when the picnic table got wet and to put our shoes on outside the tent, kind of like a welcome mat. Overall, good buy

  I'm totally happy with this tent! I used it to camp up the Oregon coast in April. We didn't actually get rain, so I can't attest to how it holds up there, but it's easy to set up and take down. The tent is well-ventilated, and was cozy in the 60-degree weather. Unfortunately, it doesn't hold heat well, so it got pretty chilly on the cooler night. Also, it lets in some breezes. That said, this tent would be perfect in moderate to warm weather.The size is perfect. We had two of us and a dog in the tent. We were able to fit the air mattress sideways (feet towards the door, head towards the back), which left quite a bit of room on the other side for our gear and the dog.I was worried the front part wouldn't cover the door fully (in case it did rain), since it's hard to tell from the pictures, but the front overhang does completely cover the door. You wouldn't have much protection from wind, but it covers the rain well.

  It gets the job done. I actually replaced my old tent with the same exact mode. Proud to camp with a Coleman. Didn’t opt for the new darker tent as no one really sleeps in when you camp (with groups of course) and I’m always up early anyways to hike, fish, explore. I only use it once or twice a year and it hold up perfect. I camp alone but this would def fit 2 more people. I use a twin air mattress with a LOT of room for luggage and other stuff. Nothing else much to say - it’s a great tent and gets the job done. Plus looks stylish too.Assembly it fairly simple and I typically can do it by myself in about 8 minutes or so depending on how quick I want to set it up. It’s pretty simple to be honest, I event set it up in pitch dark desert night before. Tare down is also simple but takes longer as you need to roll it up and what not. The bag is VERY snug and most likely might not fit everything back in it, might need a little muscle to zip it up.

  I am writing this review from inside my Coleman tent in a state park campground in Half Moon Bay. Most of yesterday and last night, there was intermittent rain and a decent amount of wind. The tent has held up quite well to both. I have not noticed the seams leaking and there wasn't any condensation dripping from the top. The rainfly does a great job of blocking rain and it leaves some space between the tent for good airflow. The bottom of the tent is a tarp like material that seems strong and easy to clean.I only have two problems with this tent and they are fairly minor. First, the tent is not difficult to set up by yourself but the rainfly can be tricky if you don't have another person. Especially if it's windy. But it's definitely still possible, it'll probably just take an extra 5-10 minutes. Second, one of the poles that held the tent up sometimes made this vibrating sound in the wind. It's not super loud and only happens in strong wind. I don't think that it ever woke me up or anything but it was slightly annoying.

  This tent is ok, as long as the weather is perfect and you are on soft ground. The stakes are weak and bend easily. It is NOT wind and rain proof. It is, however, very easy to set up and take down and is very spacious.Wind: the rainfly has a pole going through the middle that lifts it up on two sides for a nice view out the windows. When the wind blows, this pole acts as sort of a wing and the tent will lift up off the ground. If it isn’t properly staked, the tent will tip over. If it is staked into the ground, the tent will collapse in on you. It does pop up back in place without the poles breaking or coming apart though. Without the rainfly pole, the tent still sways quite a bit in the wind because it is so tall.Rain: every seam in this tent leaked. After one night of heavy rain, there were puddles in all four corners of the tent. Even the top of the tent leaked, so water dripped on me all night.

  Great tent, easy to put up and take down. Pulled it out of the bag on the campsite with an hour until dark. Needless to say I had the fire roaring and cooking up hot dogs and chili with sun to spare. Very quick and good room for two adults,a 75 lb. fur baby, and gear. Only thing I didn't understand is the half circle hole directly across the door. Kinda a breeze hole but right where your head is and when it's cold it just comes right in. Otherwise a great tent.

  I have used the tent once so far.  I am happy with it.  It goes up and down pretty quickly.  And I was actually able to get it to fit back into the bag. The zippers all worked well, although to be fair, the flap along the bottom edge of the door is kind of annoying as you really need to use two hands to ensure you don't get fabric in the zipper. I haven't yet used the passthrough for electrical but that is cool.  I easily hung an LED lantern through the loop in the center of the ceiling which worked well for a nightlight.  It was a pleasant evening and the tent kept us cool enough sleeping. I purchased a four person tent with the knowledge it would be comfortable for two.  I made the mistake of putting in a queen air mattress and a twin air mattress.  That takes up all the room so changing clothes was a challenge.  If you use air mattresses, no more than two twins is really what you should stick to.You might sleep three people in the tent if you forgo the air mattresses.  Otherwise you just won't have any room to change clothes or even change your mind. But like I said, I got this to sleep two people, myself and my 6 year old grandson.  The price is right, the tent is light and easy to assemble, and I look forward to future use.

  After seeing all the positive accolades for this tent online and seeing pictures on social media, I wanted to try it out and see what the fuss was about. I was in the market for a car camping tent for 3 people.I did not like it at all. The poles are wobbly & flimsy, everything about it is cheap. I returned it. I am okay to spend little more (100-200) for something that will last and that can withstand harsh conditions. Granted there are lot of reviews and anecdotal feedback from people who say they used it for years. So take it for what it is.I wanted better quality, and this is not it.

  I bought this tent for my boyfriend and I to use on a family camping trip. Everyone had jokes about how tiny it was but it fit my queen size air mattress wall to wall just fine. Just make sure you finish blowing the mattress up inside the tent because you'll never get it in there fully blown up.The first night I was by myself and it stormed really bad. I stayed perfectly dry and had plenty of room.The 2nd night my sister showed up with a bigger tent for my boyfriend and I to share so I can't speak how it would have been for 2. I will say this, there was no room for bags/anything extra as the air mattress was literally touching all four walls.All and all I think we could have made it work for the two of us with someone else housing our bags but not ideal.

  Bought this for our camping trip in one of texas state park. Assembly was ok, not too complicated. However we had some windy rain at midnight and one of the pole snap out!!! Mind you it was four of us, 2 adults and 2 toddlers so ofcourse it became a little chaotic and fixing the pole in the middle of midnight with rain and wind wasn’t really pleasant. Also we found some water coming into the tent from near the zipper area, although it was completely shut. At the end the tent was still useful despite its flaws but I wish I went for other leading brand or maybe the more expensive style of Coleman tent.

  It's a Coleman, what more do you need to say.I finally had to replace my other tent, the same model as this after 17 years of use. If I had taken better care of it, I know it would have lasted longer.I like how they have changed how the poles insert into the sleeves on top. They made them single tubes so that the pole doesn't catch when sliding it through. Great change!I don't like the little flap over the zipper though, keeps getting in the way. I don't think its necessary as I never had a problem with the older version leaking through the zipper.This product is great and I am looking forward to another 17+ years of camping in this tent.

  Buy extra stakes as the ones that come with are cheap metal ones that aren't really long either.  I ended up using them to hold down the tarp underneath the tent.  You don't want your tent flying away while you're off on a hike.  I added the ""Coleman 10-In.

Luckily the hook was attached to a bungee loop that I could use to anchor it down.  Overall great tent.

  This is a great product for my intended use. We took it camping for two nights, and had no problems with it at all. I loved the way they added extra room to the bag so that you can actually get the tent back in! Unfortunately it doesn't come with instructions, and as the girls of the group, we had to ask the boys what to do with the seemingly ""extra"" piece. It turned out to be the rod to keep the cover tarp from touching the roof of the tent. If you're looking for a simple tent for a simple price for a simple trip, like we were, I recommend this one.

  This tent is the perfect size and setting it up was super easy. I set it up by myself first and it took about 10 minutes, but less than 5 with two people. It's more durable than I initially thought, but it's a lot stronger than the thin tent would have you believe. It didn't rain so I can't speak to that, but it offered up a nice and cozy home away from home. My dogs loved it, even though we just took one with us, and her 77-pound body fit comfortably with two adults. We could probably fit the three dogs with us, but I didn't want to push it on our first time out. It was easy to set up and easy to break down, and was a lot roomier than I expected. I think this is the ideal size for two people, because we had room to play card games and move around a bit inside with the dog. The zippers are durable and I liked the hook inside along with the tow interior pockets. The stakes a bit flimsy, I broke one with little force, but it's not a deal-breaker, and any sports store should carry stronger ones. I remember camping in Coleman tents as a little kid, and this new tent helped me preserve those fond memories. Definitely recommend!

  This is a great beginner tent or a tent for someone who might not use it often. I used this for music festivals all summer and it held up very well through wind and rain!

It is very easy to set up! Even with just one person. Even the included stakes are still holding up well. There is a lot of room in this tent, makes it feel bigger than 9'x7.' Clearance height is also sufficient so you're not completely bent over. The included vent and hanging bags for your phone and other belongings were nice touches!

  This has been the best budget friendly car camping tent! Easy to set up. Has held up well over the last year of canping so far. Not the smallest pack or lightest weight so may not be ideal for backpacking. We primarily use to comfortable sleep 2 on an air mattress with a dog. The queen air mattress takes up about 75% of the space inside. Could fit 4 people but would be a little crowded with any gear. There is some small fraying at seams and spots where stitching is coming loose. Zipper like to catch so just be careful not to yank it and tear it. The tent stakes are pretty cheap and I have bent a few of them staking the tent down, but they still work. Definitely recommend for a roomy 2 person (+dog) car camper tent!

We just barely put in a queen size air mattress, gave us about 1.5 feet at the end of the tent and maybe about 10 inches on one of the sides.  It didn't rain or have strong winds when I was camping so cant speak on the waterproofing.

  The first time I used this tent was at my friends house, I set it up in the back yard, we had a poker party and a golf outting that weekend and I didn't want to drive 70 miles home and besides, I wanted to try out my new purchase.So, the tent went up as planned, pretty easy for one person. Plenty of room.Well, the wind started around 11:45 pm, hardly any clouds, a full moon and just a little breeze. Then it got stronger. By 12:30 I had 40 to 50 mph gusts. It kept blowing and blowing. Just when I thought it was about over, it would start again. I had the tent staked down with 10"" tent spikes. The original spikes that came with the tent are garbage. It felt like the tent was being lifted off the ground. I was holding the sides out with both feet and hands. The side of the tent facing the wind collapsed 12 times and each time it sprang back into shape. I was only about 40 feet from a 60 foot oak tree that I thought was going to blow over at any minute. At 3:45 AM the wind finally stopped. I got ZERO sleep!! When I got out, I honestly expected to see a pair of feet with ruby slippers sticking out from under my tent.I'm not a Hardcore backpacker, I'm a Laidback Car/Tent camper. For the money, you can't beat it.I made my own footprint out of a heavy duty tarp.I'm not sure how waterproof it is, but as far as the wind goes, I'm thoroughly impressed.UPDATE! The second time I've used my tent, a little wind and some rain. From sprinkles to kind of a down pour. The whole thing lasted about 30 minutes. Not one drop of water inside! I'm thrilled with this tent.I did male my own ""Footprint"" for it. I used a heavy duty tarp I trimmed down to 8'x6'. I put in some extra grommets. It sets one foot inside from the edge. It just helps prevent punctures and keeps a barrier between the tent bottom and the what water get a under. It worked PERFECT!Next time I set it up I'll take some pictures.I Hope this helps.

We had some wind gusts up to 25 mph that almost flattened the tent. Better designs (including some Coleman) seem to have more guide wires for stability. As a result one pole split. Response from Coleman: I apologize that your pole split and was weakened by the wind. But our warranty does not cover fortuitous events.What is fortuitous? Using the tent when it's windy?

  This is a tent we purchased for our son so we were looking for something that is easily set up and easy to take down. We especially liked the size, a bit bigger than a one man tent but not so big that there was a lot of wasted area - this seemed perfect.  The only complaint so far is that we took it out to the yard to set it up and the tab that holds the ring that the support is supposed to go into ripped off with very little pressure - so now I have to sew it back on  and it's too thick for my machine.  I'm hoping I can hand sew it sufficiently so that it won't be an issue in the future.

I have other more expensive tents for backpacking and more extreme camping but this will hold up on its own. It’s a 2 person tent that stands much taller than other 2 persons so more headroom. You can fit two people comfortably assuming the gear is outside but spacious for one person. It may be too heavy to use for backpacking but with some care, this tent will last for years and years.

I think we would have been fine with a 4 person but maybe if it last and our boys getting bigger it will be fine.Love all the windows - lots views to watch stars and get air flow. We did put topper over it and fits great.Was easy to set up.Great tent if your thinking of doing the same it's so worth it.

  Technically, the tent worked as needed and was perfectly fine for my camping trip. However, one of the straps that attach the tent to the tension bars broke/ripped on the first use. I tried patching it back up for the weekend with duct tape and that didn’t work for me. The tent however did still technically work. I love all the mesh “windows” that help with air circulation and it was fairly easy to put up as break down with just one person. I’m still disappointed that it broke literally the first time I used it. It’ll be fine for trips where there’s zero percent chance of any rain.

  We bought this 6 months ago and happened to use it only once this year but boy was it memorable! We went camping at a campground for Father’s Day weekend in June. This tent impressed me so much because unfortunately one night just happened to be some of the worst rain I’ve ever experienced camping. Like we are talking torrential downpours. We could see car headlights most of the night because so many people were leaving the campground. In fact when we woke up the next morning the people camping next to us had to move sites because theirs was completely flooded. We had a little bit of flooding too but this tent was an absolutely champ. We did wonder how much it could really take if the thunderstorm didn’t let up, so we almost left too, but we were dry and we wanted to stick it out and we were happy when we did. After surviving such a “horrible” night in this tent it has definitely proven its quality to me. Definitely recommend!

    RAIN FLY NECESSARY FOR PRIVACY
  
",3.0,,"Reviewed in the United States July 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  This isn't what I expected.  The tent is good quality for the price and easy to assemble but the two giant windows on the side cannot be closed for privacy.  The rain fly needs to be used to cover them up.  Now, maybe I'm the jerk here... I'm not a huge outdoorsman I'll admit, but in my moderate camping experience a rain fly is used when one wants to protect the tent from the rain, hence the name.  It's never been my experience that a rain fly is necessary to make it so others can't see right into your tent.  In other words, I always thought a rain fly was an accessory and not a necessity.  Just FYI.

  This tent is amazing! We (my 9 year old and I) camped in October with my son’s scout pack for a couple of days in Maryland.  Pouring rain both nights and heavy wind the second night. It was in the 60’s during the day and 30-40’s at night. This thing held up like a champ. The rain fly was great at keeping the rain out and stayed put against the wind. We had nice and warm sleeping bags and were very cozy. Easy to put up and take down. It’s probably ideal for no more than 3 people with gear, otherwise it will be too tight. The only things I wish were better are the mesh pockets that ripped probably because we put something too heavy and a hook at the center would be nice for an led lantern. This is a great tent, you will not be disappointed.

  UPDATE: 2+ years and dozens of uses, this thing is still going strong.  I always dry it before storage and sweep it out when needed.  Camped on ground and sand, wind, rain, sun.  Still love it.I bought this to replace a decades old tent.  The tarp floor was the main draw, as the old one I had was still from the days of nylon floors.Pros:- Fast to setup.  My wife and I can do it in < 10 mins and that's taking our time.  I have done it myself and it only takes a little longer.- Without the rainfly, the screen roof is great for stargazing.  We camped under a meteor shower a few weeks ago.- The zipper for running an extension cord- You stay dry.  I went through a decent rain, granted not a raging thunderstorm by any means, but no leaks.Cons:- Only one I can think of is when you stake it, set it up and clip all the hooks to the poles, the door zipper is a little strained. I worry about the wear and tear on it over time.  This is only a perceived con, so far, after 4 trips with constant in and out (kids), it is still working fine.As an aside, we have a queen and a twin blow up mattress that we use in this.  They take up the entire floor, but you can fit them. If it's just the queen, there's plenty of room around it to store stuff.

    Comparing this to the Coleman Hooligan
  
",4.0,J. Bennett,"Reviewed in the United States September 26, 2018","









  
  
    
  After doing a cross-country bicycle trip across America in the Coleman Hooligan, I decided to buy a new tent for my next venture just to try something new.The Sundome is a pretty good tent overall! It has that Coleman quality i've learned to trust, and I DO RECOMMEND it. However let me point out some things are different compared to the Hooligan.Pros:- IF its not raining , its base without the Rainfly offers more privacy- If you have to set up this tent while its already raining, the base already has SOME protection to help keep less water out while setting up- The pockets inside the tent are in a higher spot which keeps your stuff safer- Has a zipped up opening to plug in your devices (personally not my thing, I like less temptation to use my devices while out camping)Things to mention:I find this tent (the Sundome) to be a little less ""hardcore"". In the sense that:- The stakes are smaller and a tad bit thinner- The window doesn't open which is my least favorite thing as in the Hooligan I found an open window to be surprisingly useful- The tent is smaller in every dimension including my favorite dimension: the height of the tent (I'm a tall guy!)- The Rainfly ""hugs"" the tent less so you can expect it to be slightly less warm ( = better for warm weather, less for cold)- You have to pull 2 poles through the tent which means more setup time

  This tent is great for camping. It is very roomy- it can actually fit a queen air mattress with room to spare. I haven't had any leaks when using it in light rain and I did not do anything extra to seal it. Very easy to put together- one person can do it alone if needed.The major negative I have is it is VERY noisy in wind, and because of the height, it can be blown down more easily. I moved to the desert where it can get quite windy and this is not the best tent to use. I had a couple nights where the tent blew over. I think this tent would be perfect for other areas without so much wind, and possible with more trees to better tie things down properly. I agree with some other reviewers that it is worth it to buy some higher quality stakes separately.I would definitely recommend this tent for those looking for something easy and basic, and planning to use it in moderate conditions.

  I've only used it twice so far, but it was really tested, and it held up well. One use was in the Hoh rainforest in Washington. It rained like crazy but I stayed totally dry in the tent. The other test was the extreme polar opposite-a trip I took to Death Valley. I had several major windstorms in death valley and I was worried the tent poles would snap given how strong the wind gusts were. Again, no problem at all! The tent is also really perfect for two people (but a third would work too, although less well; not sure how you would squeeze four adults in though-that would be tight). I'm really happy with this tent. I got it for car camping and it works perfect for that. The price is so cheap that if something does eventually happen to the tent, I won't lose any sleep over it, but so far, I'm super impressed.

  I had zero camping experience, my husband remembered a few things from when he was little... We decided it was time to get back out there. After much research, we purchased this tent (thanks for the great sale, Amazon!). Not only was it it a good value, but this is a good tent. As with any 4 person tent out there, it fits 2 people very comfortably, with plenty of room for storage. I camped with a friend once, and we had plenty of room for two separate piles of stuff, while still being so far away from each other sleeping, that we would not be able to reach with our fingertips if we tried. It feels like it has sooooo much space in there when you crawl in it for the first time. It has nice little pockets for personal items and great vents to keep things cool in the summer.While it has not rained either of the times we took it out, it seems to be holding out well to moisture. We additionally sealed the seams, just to be on the safe side. The little plastic ""porch"" that comes with the tent is a nice feature also - it is so hard to get dirt out of the tent once it gets in - better to leave your shoes in a dry clean spot outside.Things got a little heated between me and my husband when we were putting it up for the first time - I chuck it up to inexperience though, as putting it up the second time was no problem at all. Pulling it down and folding it back into its carrying case was a cinch also. Basically, in good weather, this thing is your best friend and we'll see about the rest when the time comes.

  So...I needed a larg(er) family tent for some combined camping. I love Coleman products. Coleman may not be the lightest or feature rich...but they do basic stuff very well and seem to outlast more expensive products. I've run a 4 person traditional Scout tent for many, many years and had no failures.I was looking in the 6-10 person range. Seems most run well over $100 each, even many Coleman ones. I have had this same kind of tent (EZ up Dome) in several styles, names, and colors. I noticed they had a 6 person 72"" x 120"" x 120'' Sundome on Amazon for $74. Picked it up to see if it would work.First, this ten will fit 2-3 adults or 2 adults and 2-4 kids. Whatever the 'people size' of the tent it's more like half that for comfortable sleeping. You CAN get 6 full size adults in my tent but it would NOT be comfortable. Tent went up fairly easily. Really is just an oversize Dome Tent. Once you easily master it you'll love how incredibly simple it is to set up or broken down.

  This tent was pretty easy to assemble. However, we didn't discover that one of the main poles is longer than the other until we had everything set up. (The longer one is supposed to be the pole that runs along the very top. This is not in the instructions.)It is fairly lightweight, but durable. The zippers are sort of cheap. They ones on the door kept getting stuck or caught on the draft protector/flap.I haven't camped in a tent in a very long time, so perhaps the design of tents have changed, but I didn't realize that all sides aren't covered/solid unless you have the rain fly attached. In other words, two sides are just uncovered mesh, and are only covered by the rain fly. This made for some very cold nights, as the cold air couldn't be kept out.The pockets on both sides of the tent were very handy. And so was the little hook at the top that allows you to hang a lantern.What was best appreciated was the e-port zippered pocket, though. We had to run an electrical cord through it so I could use my CPAP machine to sleep, and it was so easy to do. I like that it zips up, to help keep any bugs out.Important Note: This is definitely not a 4 person tent, unless all 4 people are on the short and slim side. My boyfriend is 5'9"" and I'm 5'4"". We had our 30lb dog sleep with us, too. We all snuggled up in a queen sized air mattress and had only about 6 inches between the mattress and tent.

  The zipper on this tent did not hold up past a couple of camping seasons.  Coleman seems to have problems with the zipper in their tents.  We had another cabin tent that lasted only one season before the zipper would keep splitting.  The zipper in this tent did last a bit longer but is also splitting regularly.  It is too bad, because this tent is perfect for scouting.  It is easy to set up and seems to hold up to weather (rain) well.  My son has the four person size and could easily set it up by himself at age 10 or so.  The 4 person tent is the perfect size for two people with room to store their gear out of the elements.

  Great product. If you’re going to put two people in it you would need to have them laying side-by-side on a sleeping bag, but we bought it for one of our kids we bought them each one. They love it and it’s easy to set up the rain fly can be put on top to protect from the rain and shade or be taken off it has great circulation throughout the whole tent and a little corner piece where the electrical cords can come in and out zips closed you don’t have to worry about bugs and little creature is getting in if you don’t want to use that you can just leave it closed. It compacts down to a small little bag that’s easy to carry and expands after you bought it so that everything fits in there very nice.

    Great tent held up during 3 days of heavy rain, even during a tornado that passed overhead.

  Purchased tent for a 3 day rock festival.  Environment:  Open field soaked by a weeks worth of rain, 5"" grass, weeds, thorns, and stubble.  We purchased a heavy duty tarp for protecting the floor, so we felt nothing underneath it.The tent was NOT as easy to setup as I was led to believe; however, the winds were in excess of 30 mph while we were trying to set it up.  But with some help from our camper friends next to us, it went up just fine. Took about an hour including the ground tarp.The first night during torrential Oklahoma rains, there were about 3 drops in each corner.  The next day we sprayed those areas with some Scotch Guard and no issues the next night during the rain.This tent required the use of larger stakes than were included.  We had purchased some, and recommend the same for anyone using this tent especially if the ground is damp.The side pockets are handy, we stored quite a few items in them.Did not use the lantern hanger, but if you do, you will need a hook, it just a plastic loop.Is it very sturdy? While it does tend to flex a bit in the higher winds; it is very sturdy, make sure you pull everything very tight. On Saturday night we had a tornado warning, the sirens went off, we ran for our truck (its all we had).  A tornado passed overhead producing winds in excess of 70 mph with horizontal rain, small bb size hail.After it passed we expected the worst; however, the only issue was the front part under the rain cover collapsed enough to let some rain blow in, but at 70+ mph we were happy.  Unfortunately the rain came in right over a sleeping bag, but even then it was not enough to cause an issue.  Unfortunately our neighbors tent was flattened, and everything completely soaked.Recommend this tent, we have 5 tents in our collection, some from other manufacturers; this one has proved itself.  also it breathes so it's not a winter tent by any means, but great for probably a 3 season tent if you have warm sleeping bags for Autumn and Early spring.Oh also the instructions were in Spanish, the English ones we found later in the box.  The pics were good enough.

  To start, I researched tents for days before I made this purchase and I'm totally satisfied. I was looking for a lightweight, compact, very waterproof tent at a good price and this tent met all the criteria.  I've used this tent to camp in Hawaii 4 times so far and it's really been terrific. Bought it for a camping trip in Maui and it's small enough that it fit nicely in my carry on luggage- which was one of my biggest concerns. Additionally, It's held up through several rainy Hawaiian nights and I have never gotten wet. I did spray the whole tent with waterproofing spray before use though, which I'd recommend. The tent materials seems very durable and waterproof. The only water that ever found it's way in was through small seam where the tent material meets the footprint material and the seam meets inside the tent. It poured all night and only about 4 drops of water found their way in through the seam- so no real complaints. This tent has also been really easy to set up and take down. I can set it up by myself in less than 10 minutes and when I take it down, for once it actually fits in the bag without any problems. A great tent at a Great price!

  I had previously owned a 4 person instant tent. I loved the thing but it was just way too big and did not pack down to a decent size (forget trying to stuff it back in the provided bag). I needed something that would pack down smaller and was easy to manage.One of my friends had this tent and she had nothing but high praise for it. So when it came time for our annual camping trip, I snagged one of these just days before. I really love this thing! It solves the biggest issue I had which was the size of our last tent. This thing packs down small and the provided bag that it comes in actually expands once you tear off the bottom strip. The tent stuffs back into the back wonderfully! Set up is easy and I was able to get it constructed by myself in about 7 minutes.We only have used it for one night, but that one night was great. We slept with the rain fly off and could see the stars at night. The temperatures dropped to 50° and we were warm and cozy all night. There are two mesh pouches to store your belongings in and a little plastic loop at the very top so that you can hang a lightweight camping light. Two windows on the front and back which is also nice. I can't comment on waterproofness just yet, but I may revisit my review once we get rained on. The size says three people but I would have to say two people and some gear. My girlfriend and I both had sleeping pads and there was plenty of room on the size for gear.My only complaint is that the tent spikes that come with this thing are garbage. More than half of them bent extremely easily. Go invest in some higher quality spikes and you'll be good to go!

  Got this tent for a short camping trip in Shenandoah, VA with a friend. I am new to camping, and was just looking for something relatively cheap to try out. My friend already had a large tent for her family, and I was just looking for something for only me that would provide a bit of privacy. This did do the job, but it was a tight fit. I don't see how anyone could fit two people and their stuff. I have a blow up twin sized mattress that fit perfectly, leaving only about a foot of room on the long side of the tent. Great for sleeping, but that was about it. Had to change clothes lying down :).We did get caught in quite a storm and this tent did splendidly. Kept all my stuff dry, and I didn't see ANY water in the tent except what I tracked in myself. (We did have an additional tarp set up above it, so I can't speak to the efficacy of the rain fly, but the bottom of the tent performed very well!This is a SUMMER WEATHER tent. There are two sides at the top where it doesn't close at all, it just has a mess netting. This made for one very chilly night for me, but I was very happy the rest of the time. WOULD NOT recommend if you are going anywhere where it gets below around 50 at night.I put this tent up alone with no problem, even as a novice tent setter-upper. All in all, very satisfied!

If it hadn't been for the rain this tent would have easily lasted for awhile. I purchased the 4 person tent and it easily fit 6 of us comfortably while we were seated inside. We could've fit 2 additional people comfortably also. Def a must buy for the price and quality! Coleman products offer the best products!!

  Now that we have used the tent a dozen or so times, I feel comfortable rating this tent at a full five stars. For the price, it is surprising that it has held up perfectly.

We haven't used it in snow so can't comment on its performance there. Packing it back up is very easy and it fits in the bag effortlessly.A queen size mattress is a very tight fit, so we have to use our twin mattresses instead. I'm 6'5"", and fit but it's a bit snug when lying straight out. Only thing I needed to get was a few extra stakes for really windy days. It does come with 8 but I wanted some longer ones.

  I got this right on time for my birthday camping trip. If you REALLY want to be close to someone and not have space for your things, this is perfect. I got it for myself, my twin sized air mattress, and my bag. I'm 5'7"" and I weigh 120lbs and at times, I wished I had more space, especially when I had to change - over all though, it was comfortable enough to sleep in. My only real complaint is that the zipper kept getting stuck in the same spot, nothing I shouldn't be able to fix though.

  We bought this specifically for quick weekends away.  Set-up and teardown are easy as can be.  With two people, it goes up in a few minutes and comes apart almost as quickly.  We didn't get any rain, so I can't vouch for how watertight it is.  The only issue was fitting it back into the bag afterwards.  There is definitely some trick to getting it re-rolled tight enough, but we haven't found it.Only one complaint - after the first use, the carry bag split right above the handle.  We're not sure if that was a defect or if trying to fit it back in stressed a seam.  Either way, we're ditching the bag and buying another that's a little sturdier and roomier from a local discount shop.Inside, the tent is large enough for weekend gear and a queen air mattress.  The mesh pockets are a nice bonus, as it makes it easy to locate glasses, cell phones, etc.  Ventilation is more than adequate (the ground-level vent was a brilliant touch).  We had zero condensation inside.  We didn't use the electrical port, but it seems to be well-designed - high enough to avoid seepage and wide enough to accommodate large cords.Like all Coleman tents, the zippers work perfectly.  No snags or special handling required (our only complaint with our GigaTent - the zippers tend to catch on the rain flaps).  The door is more than wide enough for transporting items in and out.Overall, I would highly recommend this tent for weekend getaways.  Tall people (over 6'00""), may have to bend over a bit, but the generous floor space (10x10) makes up for it.

  This is actually a pretty decent tent. It is very spacious and pretty tall in the inside. My daughter and I had way more than enough space to sleep. I bought the 4 person tent and unlike other tents this tent will fit 4 people if you really wanted to. Not sure how well it holds up in the rain, but then again I don't intend to use it in rainy weather. Plenty of ventilation for air to pass through. It's definitely a summer tent more than a winter tent because of all the open screened ventilation openings. Light weight and easy to set up.

  My son stays with me on the weekends but our current house is too small to accommodate him as far as having his own space and sleeping area. We decided to try out using a tent so that he could have some space to himself. He's tall, so we went with this tent for the headroom and it's larger floor space. We live in Northern California, right on the coast in Mendocino County, and since the purchase of this tent in January, it has weathered every storm and bought of rain since then with no leaks in any of the seams, or in the fabric itself! Because of the taller canopy, it's a bit floppy in strong winds, but even in the strongest winds, when it was practically flattening, the rain fly stayed secure and prevented the rain from getting into the two large open screened areas. I am really impressed, it has weathered some serious constant downpours for days at a time, and the only place water got in was through the little port for putting your extension cord, and it was a trivial amount. DISCLAIMER: This is the second tent of this model that I purchased, as the first one immediately started seeping water through the wall seems. I returned it for the same model and have had no issues. Of course, as is probably true with all tents, I recommend getting some deeper and better quality tent stakes, as the ones that came with it could not do much against being constantly pulled around in the stormy winds. But i guess that's only if you'll be out in really windy weather.

  An inside pocket in this tent was sewn accidently to side of the tent, so when I set it up, it didn't look right.  A couple of friends found the flaw and we had to cut open the pocket to fix it.  So, the pocket was ruined, but it wasn't a big deal. I can fix the pocket and the now corrected tent went up-- and was taken down-- fine. Coleman tents are of great quality and after letting it sit in the rain, I inspected the inside of the tent and all areas were ""water tight."" I spent a night in the tent and was very pleased. It was VERY well ventilated, solidly constructed and I look forward to using it on many camping trips in the future.

  My adult daughter and I enjoyed this tent.  It was for a 5 night trip.  We had a lot of rain but we kept dry, and had just enough room for our gear.  I highly recommend it, especially for the price.Update, 7/2019.  We've continued to use this tent with good success. One strong point of the tent is the ventilation.  The way the rain fly is configured, and because of the small window at the bottom (don't forget to stake it) we had great airflow.  Other our our crew mates had tents with flys covering top-to-bottom and weren't able to enjoy the nice breezes like we did.One thing - the door always, always, always fall into the tent immediately.  If it's wet, your tent is then wet.  And the little flap over the zipper catches often.  COLEMAN: Redesign this door!!

  Bought this to set up in the living room to occupy and entertain small kids during the pandemic when there was too much cold and snow outside this spring. It is extremely lightweight - we’ve taken it up and down the stairs several times, and the kids can move it around effortlessly. We have not had it outside yet, but slept an adult and two small kids comfortably in the living room. Zippers are durable, as they’ve stood the test of toddler hands for months of continuous zipping and unzipping.

Took the tent up Cache La Poudre River in Colorado. The tent was easy to set up; even in the wind and sprinkling. It is great in the warmer weather, but due to the tall inner height, and the vent below it got pretty cold when the temp dropped down to 40F. Lucky for us we had a tarp to cover the vent, and good sleeping bags. Overall the tent is a great buy for the price, and ease of set-up. There was plenty of room for my wife, my son, myself, our 2 dogs, and still had room for gear. We will be using this tent throughout the summer for sure.

  My boyfriend and I are new to camping and we wanted a reasonably priced beginner's tent, so we purchased this one. It's great! Three people might be a tight fit, but it's perfect and roomy for just us two. There was plenty of room above our heads so we could sit and talk comfortably. There's plently of ventilation on the inside so it doesn't get too stuffy. I also like the loop on the ceiling where you can hang your lantern at night. It's super simple to put together. We set it up in the backyard so we could practice putting it together before our trip. There is a 2 minute YouTube video that was really helpful. It honestly only took maybe 10 minutes for us to set it up, for our very first time putting a tent together ever. It was also just as easy to break down and pack it up. This tent is super sturdy if you insert the spikes correctly! A tip from my dad was to insert the spikes diagonally (a 45° angle) towards the tent. Make sure you pull the corners tight, and you have yourself a windproof tent! We didn't experience any rain in the Chihuahuan desert in July, so I can't speak for it's waterproofness. However, this tent is exactly what I was looking for! Especially for the price, I'm very happy with this purchase. Highly recommend as a beginner's tent for two people. When the time is right for marriage and starting a family, I do plan on investing in a larger/more expensive tent.

  Well, we used it for a week of camping, we set it up and took it down 3 times on our trip and slept in it all 7 nights. My impression is that it's a solid summer tent. We used the rain cover or whatever it's called. It provided privacy and seemed to hold in a bit of the warmth. We camped in weather that got down to near 50 for the first 2 days, which felt almost too cold in the tent with our summer sleeping bags, but the rest of the trip only got down into the high fifties at night and that felt good to us. I like this style of tent, which seems to be the way everything is made now, with the supports being only on the outside of the tent. No complaints, great value at $60. The only reason I might hesitate to take my review super seriously is because we haven't used it for very long.

  This tent is definitely on the more inexpensive side in comparison with other tents which is great for anyone interested in trying out camping. Setting this up is relatively easy (much easier with two people) and can be ready in roughly 15 minutes. I ended up not needing it but the rain fly is great to have in the event that you get some unexpected showers. Only downside to this tent is the low quality stakes, however these can be found elsewhere for relatively cheap.

  I am only giving 4 stars at this time as I really need to see it rained upon before I can give a more thorough assessment. I have set it up 5 times, and I have been camping three times in the month since I have gotten it. I have had no problems with it at this time. The setup is fairly quick and straightforward. This size tent should be good for two people with some gear. If you were to put a queen size mattress in this tent, then I imagine that there would not be much room for your gear. However, this would probably not be a bid deal since you are probably using this for car/walk in camping. The advertisement says that it is good for backpacking, but you would have to carry this tent the entire time due to its size, and it would get old at some point.Do understand that there will not be as much airflow with this tent as with others. It has a mesh roof (on two sides) and mesh windows on two sides, but the walls are fabric. The benefit to this design is that you get much more privacy. I am camping in Texas, and I have been able to sleep fairly comfortably.One general tip for this tent is to make sure NOT to drag the ends of your tent poles on the ground too much. They are open for you to attach to the tent, and they can get debris in them so it makes it hard to attach to the little metal rods on the tent. You will understand once you get it.

  Great little tent for car camping. It is rather SMALL. I had to sleep diagonal to keep from bumping into the walls(I am 5'4""), I would recommend caution for anyone over 6 ft, and those trying to fit two people. While two people could definitely fit in, it would be very cramped. VERY WATER RESISTANT. It rained pretty heavily one night, but nothing inside got wet. I was unable to take the time to dry it out before putting it away, and that evening when I took it out, most of it was still rather damp. However when i set it up the inside was dry, and even though it rained again the night, I stayed dry and warm.  The door is a couple inches above the base, making it more water proof, but also kind of a struggle to get in and out without getting mud/dirt on yourself or inside the tent. I used a base tarp under the tent (because that is how I was taught to camp), but you def. don't need one.

Unfortunately, I am wilderness camping for the next two months.Anyone know what size double zippper the tent door takes?Please Help, Darn mosquitoes!Other than that zipper, it is a nice lightweight tent that only took 20 minutes to set up the first time. Suggestion: buy yourself some quality tent pegs before you go camping with this tent.  The tent stakes that came with the tent are worthless!  Oh, and make sure the zipper for the front door works. Don’t be like me who’s out in the middle of nowhere stuck with a door that can’t be zipped up!

  Good thing I test-pitched my new tent the day before I left on my campout, or I wouldn’t have known that one whole pole was missing, and the other two have limp, floppy elastic that lets the segments fall apart. The tent only included one of the two main poles, the rain fly pole, and two random loose pole segments with only one metal connector each.  No idea whether the tent has other good qualities, since I had to leave it at home and use a different tent.

It does have a bathtub floor by the way. It held up no problem! Through rain,small branches,wind,bugs. I did not expect these great results.

  I just used this brand new tent to camp for four nights and I'm a new-ish camper. I did 1 night at one campground and 3 at another. It is very easy to put up. Note the fabric instructions have two sides and the instructions for the rain fly or kind of hidden (you'll need it!! I was very close to the ocean the first night and there was a great deal of condensation in the morning, to my newbie surprise). The tent pegs or stakes are very cheap, they bend easily, and don't hold that well. They also turn in place by themselves so whereas they were holding the tent down fine in one corner, one side was out when I went to take it down.I couldn't fold the tent compact enough to get everything inside the box after I took it down. I'll tackle that at a park, since I live in a condo and don't have a yard.I couldn't stand up in it, but I think all tents of this size are the same (I saw more at a store today). It is not a three-person tent unless it's a couple and a child. There was enough room for a queen sized blowup bed with about a foot or more left on one side. The tent was very easy to assemble and take down.I think I'll move on to bigger tents after this and save this for emergencies or for a friend.

  I’ve had this tent for a couple of years now and I have enjoyed using it during my camping trips.  It fits three small adults comfortably and it is very easy to set up. I have stayed dry in this tent even in windy and wet conditions. I really like the two mesh pockets on the inside of the tent to store small things like glasses and keys. It is a little bulky so probably not ideal for backpacking purposes, but it definitely is possible to backpack with  this tent if you separate the tent from the poles  and have two people transport it

  We used this tent for a week-long camping trip in rainy south Wales. I went over all the seams with brush-on seam sealer and emptied a can of Scotchgard Heavy Duty Water Shield onto the tent before use. I also cut a footprint for it out of some thick plastic sheeting that I bought at a hardware store. We did not actually test it before our trip, but luckily, the tent performed flawlessly. This is a good-sized tent for two adults and a lot of gear. Especially for a ""low-end"" tent, this thing rocks! Would definitely buy it again, if I had it to do over again.

  Small is an understatement for this tent. The description assures that it will fit a queen sized air mattress--and that is literally the only thing it can fit. I'm 5'3"" and my feet and head touched the sides of the tent as I slept. If you do attempt to fit a queen sized air mattress in it, be prepared for the tent to hardly be able to zip. This tent might be ideal if you don't camp using air mattresses and if you're the only person who's going to be using it.

  Very spacious tent, great for summer camping. Easy set up, it fits two comfortably and it would fit 4 if you literally all sardined on the floor which I don't recommend. As a woman that likes her space, I bought this because I'm 5'10'' and tend to overpack, it was perfect! This thing withstood strong desert winds and the Pacific Coast during two of my field schools and is still a very reliable tent. It was a bargain, but I will say, I probably would check the weather next time I take it out on an excursion just because you don't benefit from the open-ness of the tent when you're waking up in 40 degree weather with a windchill that made you wish for sweet death. (I only speak from experience). This tent is great for the summer and it's pretty durable! It gets the job done, it also fits a cot in case some of you were wondering.

  I got this on sale, and it’s great for what I paid. It’s huge. 10x10 footprint and I could stand up inside. Easy, classic two pole setup. One person can set it up, but it’s a breeze with 2 people. I always appreciate having somewhere on the ceiling to hang a lantern as well.The best part is the ventilation. Many tents often sacrifice ventilation for better weatherproofing. The screened sides, vent, plus the windows provide excellent ventilation even with the rain fly on. The rain fly is also designed well to provide ventilation without sacrificing cover. It didn’t rain on my trip, so I can’t comment on how rain proof it actually is otherwise, though.

  We've had this tent for almost 4 years, I figured I'd finally do a review.  We use it 3-4 times a year.Pros:-Airy-Spacious-Door can be a screen door-2 pockets and hanger to hang up a flashlight and put all your necessities in the side pockets-The door is pretty big and easy to climb in and out of-There is a good amount of space at the end of a queen mattress to put your stuff-Holds 2 queen mattresses-Option to take the rainfly off and sleep under the stars-Doormat, kind of helps, it keeps some of the sand out of the tent but don't expect it to be amazing, it's just plastic.-Directions were sewn inside the bag so they weren't lost from season to season.-Felt sturdy, I didn't feel like it was going to blow over in the wind.Cons:-The side windows are always open, rain, sleet, or cold, those windows are always open with just the rainfly to keep the cold air out-6' height interior is 6' in the absolute middle, then it quickly slopes and is no longer comfortable to stand in, even for a 5' petite woman-6 person is a big stretch.  Even without mattresses, more than 4 people are smushed.  The last 2 people have to sleep at the feet of the first 4  which means climbing on someone's sleeping bag and no place to store your stuff..-This requires TWO adults to put the rainfly on.  Everything else can be done with an adult and an 8 year old, an adult is needed for the rainfly.  It is NOT the easy up and down they claim it to be.  I'm 5', I've told my kids they can go camping with me when it's just the 2 of us once they're 10 when I know they are tall enough to get the rainfly on.-I'm not sure if I did it wrong, but I could not get the rainfly cords to stake down tight.  At one point the side corrds were flapping in the breeze.-When we set it up initially in our backyard, there was a bad storm and it leaked.  I had already put seam sealer on it so I'm not sure where it was leaking.  Was it coming in from the windows or was it coming up from underneath?  It was a bad storm, we got about 2"" of water and it came down in sheets so who knows if it would have leaked in a normal rainstorm.  That said 2 years later when out camping, there was hail and heavy rain and winds (found out there was a tornado not far away), the tent stayed dry, in one piece, and we made it out dry and alive.Side note, just so you know:-Those windows in the front and back?  Yes you CAN see into the tent from outside.  Be sure to close them when you're getting dressed.  The people next to us may have gotten an (unwanted) show!-To get the tent back into the very small bag, fold it in 1/4s, roll it tightly, squish the air out and hope your hands are strong enough to keep it held in a small roll.  It didn't look as pretty but it did fit.On a night that it dropped into the low 60's, I used this with a sleeping bag rated for 50-70 degree weather, wearing light pants and light long sleeves (lightweight cotton), the openness of the tent letting in the cool breeze and damp made me cold.  It was great for keeping the tent cool during the day but how often do you go into your tent during the day.I would definitely recommend it for a family of 4, not 6.

  Temper your expectations a little bit, and this is a really good tent. I bought this for car camping, and it works well. It's reasonably light and easy to carry, setup and teardown once you know what you're doing take 10 minutes, and it stands up to weather reasonably well. I took it for a trial run a couple of weekends ago when we had a nice storm front blow through, and we didn't get wet at all. The rainfly kept everything nice and dry, and we stayed pretty comfortable.If you plan to take this anywhere with a lot of wind, buy better stakes. The ones included are your basic steel shepherd's crook style pegs. They work fine for light-duty work, but if you want something that will keep everything in place under harsher conditions, spend the extra $15 to buy the Y-shaped style of stake.If you end up using this tent a lot, go ahead and invest in a spray-on tent sealant. It doesn't need it too much right off the bat but after a few uses, it would probably leak under heavy rain.Also, as with every tent's capacity, a 4-person tent assumes you are very comfortable spooning for the whole night. My wife, myself, and two dogs all comfortably fit in this tent, even with us both using air mattresses. Three people using backpacking pads and sleeping bags would be comfy, four people would be a tight squeeze.

Everything feels pretty rugged. Maybe be gentle with the main door zipper as that seemed a little worrisome going around the corners but even that was not a big concern of ours.

Others in the camp brought monster tents with fans - this baby kept very cool due to the ground-level vent (3rd photo, white flap) which captures ground air movement and funnel up and out through the vents.  10-minutes to setup first time, stakes aren't really necessary unless for setup but clearly help the runoff (had ~1/4"" of rain at 4am).

I could also see rain getting in if there was a bad storm.the 4 person tent is really roomy and being short (just over 5ft)  I could stand up in the middle, we loved the amount of pockets for all your stuff on the inside.

  Got this unfortunately more than 30 days ago for a week long motorcycle camping trip. Setting up camp for the second night and the screen portion on the door rips out. I’ve been camping forever and have other Coleman tents which is why I bought this one thinking it would at least last the week. Wrong!  If you ever set up a dome style tent before you won’t have any problems getting this one set up. Takes maybe ten minutes for one person. Had some light mist and heavy winds and see the first night and with a tarp grind clothe it stayed dry. I wouldn’t purchase it again based on the rip.

  I bought the 3-person tent for my son. I knew that realistically 3 people would never sleep in such a small tent, but I assumed it would be more than large enough for just one. He had to turn his twin sized air mattress diagonally to fit, and at 6'1"" he was not entirely comfortable. Although I should have bought the larger size, the tent is easy to set up and lightweight. I treated the tent and rain fly with camp-dry before our trip, and everything stayed dry through two nights of rain.

  This tent is great for summer and warm spring/fall camping.  The sides under the fly are screen only up to the top, so lots of ventilation.  We could stand up easily in it, and hung a light from the center for the evenings.  I had a hard time with the bottom of the door being so high up, you have to step over it to get in, which I'd appreciate more on a rainy camping trip.  Set up easily, and packed away just as easily, since the bag is extra large - Coleman knows you can't get it back to original pack size, and makes extra room for that.

   This tent saved my boyfriend and I on a camping trip that went completely awry. For info, this was the first time for both of us camping on our own, first time using this tent, and we camped in June at Bennett Spring, MO for 3 nights. It is very compact for travel (2 1/2' x 5""), and I was able to get it back in the bag upon take down. Setting the first time took about 15-20 minutes, take down less than 10. I was surprised to find such a cheap tent with Coleman's name on it, and it was worth every penny.I'll start with the not so great things. First and foremost, the style of the tent has the corners pulled SO taught when it is set that there are teeny tiny needle point-sized holes in the corners. It lets in nothing but rain, but even then it's not that much. I'll touch on that when I get to the good things. Also, the zipper protector is completely necessary and helpful, it can just be a huge pain because it gets snagged and caught in the zipper a lot. I was able to stand up almost completely in the center of the tent (I'm a little more than 5') but my boyfriend could not. We did not use an air mattress, but there was plenty of room still with the pool floaties we slept on, a huge sterilite container, our box fan, and more. Speaking of our box fan, the weather was complete garbage on our trip. It was HOT; the heat index got up to 110. This tent has tons of ventilation- even a little vent in the bottom on the back. We definitely needed the box fan any time we spent more than 2-3 minutes in the tent, and it was going all night. One of the nights did get down to 60, and I was shivering. So it's safe to say that this is not a flaw of the tent, just more of a tip for fellow campers. When it's hot, it's hot!I will now begin raving about this tent. Our first night, we got severe thunderstorms and torrential downpour for almost eight hours straight. We stayed completely dry!! I was convinced that it was going to leak or at least start seeping through the walls eventually, but it didn't! Some water did get through the aforementioned corners, but I was able to use a hand towel to dry it up and the towel was still mostly dry. Very impressive. The next day, the tent had a few hours to dry in the sun before more severe weather came through. After the previous night, we didn't want to be around for it, so we left camp for the afternoon. More torrential downpour, this time tornadic weather, so there was a LOT of very strong winds. In all seriousness, this storm literally took down a tree and several branches on the campground campus, but not our tent!!! Out of 7 steaks, all but one was torn out of the ground, and the tent had been shoved forward about 1 foot and was leaning about 65 degrees forward. The tent was easy to set up (we did do a full trial run before leaving), but the very rocky Missouri soil made it extremely difficult to get the steaks in well at the campsite. The one steak that was in the ground still was the one we were actually able to get in well, so I can't say if the steaks were ripped out strictly because of wind, or if they were set more poorly than we thought. I would still recommend different, stronger steaks, because the ones that come with are flimsy. I purchased 4 MSR Groundhog steaks that we used on our tarp underneath and they were unphased by the storms. Needless to say, all our stuff inside was safe and dry!!!!!! The corners did their infamous leak again, but I dried it up just the same as last time (and then we reset the tent in the dark by flashlight!). No poles broken, nothing ripped, no leaks that weren't the corners. I will add that we used those interlocking foam mats on the floor of our tent to make it a little more comfy, and upon pulling them up when we were leaving, there was moisture that we are assuming was from the corners, but don't know for sure. We were on a very slight downhill, and the moisture was only under a small portion of the front three mats. Thinking it was just the water from the corners rolling forward. Everything else was fine and dry.I have photos of it set, but have to post them later. I am including a video of the storm from inside during the first night. I know that being in a tent amplifies how rain sounds, but it was truly as bad as it sounds in the video.Edit to add: we did no waterproofing on our tent.

  The 2 man tent is a little cramped for 2 people. I’m 5’9” and found my self touching both ends. The rain cover stopped the rain on night one and the side walls leached a little water. However, night 2 was just heavy dew and the inside walls were soaked by morning and my sleeping bag was damp as if I hadn’t had a cover over me. It’s probably a great tent for non-wet camping for children, but not enough for adults and repeated water applications.

  Easy to assemble and well constructed to boot.  I would love to see the size of the four humans who were used in the sizing tests for Coleman though.  The tent is very open and not suitable for cold temperatures even with the fly installed.  My only minor complaint is that water enters the tent when you unzip the main opening because the flap basically falls inside the tent.

Would start to get uncomfortable in temps below 50F, especially with any wind (remember ""good airflow"" - but you have no option to stop it).  Not durable in my experience.My experience with the Coleman Sundome 6 tent:I bought this tent so my two kids and I would have more space when car camping (vs 3 person tent we use backcountry) and to allow the option for a friend or two).  As with all tent specs, 6 sleeping bags would cover 100% of the floor space in this 6-person tent.  I used it on a single 4 day car camping trip in WV in June.  It rained LIGHTLY the last day on/off for a couple hours with NO wind. When we went into the tent to sleep that night we found puddles of a few ounces in each of 3 corners and just a few drops in the forth corner with the cord access port.  Very disappointing.  The tent was setup correctly with all guy lines and a footprint 6-9"" smaller than the tent perimeter on all sides (doing this for more than 40 years).  Although dry when we broke camp, I set it up at home for a good dry out before storage as I always do upon returning from a camp trip.  While evening out the poles in the sleeves after erecting the tent, one of the pole couplers ripped a 6"" gash in a sleeve (I could not find a burr on the coupler).  Amazon allowed me to return the tent without complaint - great customer service.  My sister has two Coleman Redwood 6-person tents (they don't sell them anymore) and they have never leaked even under harsh conditions.

We had about 2-3 feet of space on the side. The tent was easy to set up. One thing I would recommend is getting a tarp to put under it to protect the floor of the tent from any damage. We opted to use the rain fly not because of the rain, but because of the temperature. The tent stayed probably 10 degrees warmer than the outside temperature and we were very comfortable!

  I used this tent only once at a Cub scout overnight. Set up was very easy. Never rained so I can't tell how it would hold up there.The roof ventilation netting area is very large. I am assuming that it is made for very warm climates; as the name would suggest. I paid no attention to the name because it came up under a search for a 3 season tent. And of course, the term ""season"" is a variable term when climate, geography and topography are considered. The opening is large enough that passers by were stooping and looking in. I figured out a remedy in staking the rain fly close to the tent to pull it tight to the opening.I would have been pleased and kept it for summer camping; except that as I was taking it down, I noticed that it had formed a tear along the door zipper about half way up. No one operated it but me and I didn't use it in any improper, aggressive or stressful way. It had been a calm, mild and dry night. But a tent designed for camping in the woods and wilderness shouldn't wilt so easily when faced with even moderate to strong challenges.I most definitely didn't want to have to send it back and look for another one.I gave 3 stars because other than the tear it seemed nice, but I suppose that would negate any other good qualities; especially if it rained, and noting that tears only grow larger.

  Overall, the tent is ok. Good for 2 campers if you have 2 individual pads or 1 larger air mattress. We were on a 3-day, 2-night camping trip, and it unfortunately rained a lot (especially at night). After the first night, I noticed that the end of my sleeping bag was pretty damp (away from the vents and the front). I felt that side of the tent and it seemed like water was seeping through the material. The second night had torrential downpour. The rainfly did a really good job, but I woke up during the storm to find my sleeping pad and bag were soaking wet. We could see water was pooling up on the inside wall of the tent pretty bad. I wish I would have taken pictures to show how bad it was. Yes, all of the vents and zippers were closed. We knew the storm was going to be bad, so we double checked.  From the other reviews I've read, I don't know if my tent was defective, or the other reviews exaggerated the storms they experienced, but this tent is definitely not waterproof. It's possible that this tent can't handle continued rain. But, the setup was really easy. Good venting. So, a good tent if you know it's not going to storm.

    Coleman tent review
  
",4.0,raymond,"Reviewed in the United States September 19, 2017","









  
  
    
  Setting up: I first set the tent up in my living room by myself and it was pretty easy to do so. A second person definitely helps so they can hold up the polls in the middle of the tent while you are connecting them to the tent. I first used it this past weekend for two nights.  The stakes that come with this are not very good at all.  They are small and have a flat bottom. We had pretty hard ground and had a stake bend while putting it in. We were able to bend it back, but it is worth buying different stakes.Rain: It ended up raining on Sunday morning and the tent held up very well even with some of our things pushing against the outside of the tent. There was no water or dampness inside the tent.Size: This says 4 person tent, but it is usual to half this amount for the true size.  For two people, this was adequate.  We had a double tall queen air mattress which fit, but since it was double tall, it pushed against the outer tent a little bit.  With the air mattress inside, there was still room for our bags, snacks, and a small side table as well as room to change.  Although, unless you are 5' tall or less, standing up straight in the tent will not happen.Packing up:  We had to pack the tent while it was wet and still slightly drizzling, but it is quick and easy. The worst part is getting the air out so you can roll it up, but that comes with any tent.Accessories: The tent has a small ring (not hook) at the top to hang a lantern or other lights. We brought a light meant for under a cupboard and it lit the whole thing up.  There are three netted pockets on the sides of the tent to put any loose items in which was very nice.  The windows can be opened all the way even in rain as long as the rain isn't coming in sideways. There is a flap on the back that can be staked out and helps with air flow in the tent.  The rain cover acts as an illuminator as well. A dim light could even work well enough to light up the whole tent.Overall, I would recommend this tent for anyone who is looking for something small to use and of high quality.

  This is our second tent. Cabela's lost a customer when their customer service department wouldn't respond to repeated attempts at getting information for new parts for our old tent, so I threw it out. This tent is comfortable, lightweight, waterproof, and held up better than the Cabela's off-shoot brand. Even with windy days, this tent didn't move. We aren't hardcore campers yet, so this is inexpensive enough that we'll get considerable use and not be heartbroken when it's  time to buy a new one.

  We took this with us for a week long camping trip up to the MN/Canada border.  Got down in the 30's every night and rained almost every day.  We had 2 single blow up mattresses and all our gear in the tent with plenty of room to spare.  You could fit 3 people comfortably, but 4 would be too close for comfort.  The tent was dry and comfortable every night.  We put an 8'x10' tarp down on the ground too as a water/ moisture bearer just to be safe.  This tent is light weight, folds up into a small carry bag (actually fits back into the bag easily)

  I like this tent, I have only been camping twice and it was super easy to set up.  It does fit exactly two standard sleeping bags and you could throw a couple of small bags in there but it will sit on top of your sleeping bags, there is no extra room because the sleeping bags cover the entire floor of the tent.  I think it's worth it if you are car tenting for two and have most of our belongings in the car close by. It did not rain but it did get misty and the tent did feet a bit wet when I touched it from the inside, not sure how it would with hold against rain.

  Just got this tent in the mail and set it up. It really does take 10 minutes to setup by yourself; half that if you have an extra person. As far as the dimensions, I'm a bit skeptical. I'm 5'6"" and when lying in this tent vertically from the door opening, my legs stick out the door up to my knees which is way more than a foot long. But maybe I'm measuring something wrong here. I don't know. Either way, this tent gets the job done. Thanks.

  Beginner camper: I read a lot of reviews on this tent and I don’t think you could go wrong. I bought the four person tent and there was plenty of room for me (5’7” 130#), my stuff, and two 60 lb dogs. I couldn’t stand up at full height but I didn’t expect to. Setup was easy for one person. It took some effort to get everything back in the bag (again, first timer). I don’t recommend it for cooler weather though.

",4.0,G. Mullins,"Reviewed in the United States November 4, 2018","









  
  
    
  I bought this gently used and fulfilled by Amazon in case I needed an uncomplicated return. It had been used maybe once and the rain fly seemed unused, so great condition. My 5 & 6 year old helped me set it up in 30 min on our first trial run (but I could do it in 20 by myself). However, our first time using it was on a scout camp-out and I had to set up the tent in darkness. With the help of two older scouts, we got it done fairly easily considering how dark it was, and how inexperienced I am. It probably took more like 40 min that night. Still, it really is easy to put up and take down when you can see! It's very roomy -- we had full and twin inflatable mattresses and plenty of room for our stuff. It's going to be a fantastic SUMMER tent. But that night it got down to 40 degrees F and it was seriously the coldest night of my life!! Absolutely miserable. I had even tried to cover one mesh wall with emergency mylar blankets and it didn't help. We had extra moving blankets under and over our sleeping bags, hats on our heads, extra layers of clothing, put the rain fly as close to the walls as possible -- COLD. COLD. COLD. I would say 55 degrees would be the coldest I would sleep in this tent, and even then I'd take extra measures to be warm in there. The two mesh walls just aren't designed to hold in warmth. Otherwise, we do love it! And I would highly recommend it for camping in milder weather. Oh, and a new duffle bag is needed to pack it in, the one it comes in its really small and came with a tear already in the bottom.

  For under 50$ this tent is amazing. I've taken it backpacking many times now and took it for a week in Washington. Easy set up and not too cumbersome. I managed to also fit a tarp in the bag it comes with too. It holds up in the rain really well if you can lay a tarp under it when setting up. The only issue I had with water was just from condensation but that's with any tent. This thing has been in some pretty heavy rain and I woke up nice and dry. For the price this thing is amazing.

  My sons first tent (12). He was able to put things together fast(very easy instructions).  We had only light rain but nothing leaked in the tent. We did put a tarp down before laying down the tent. With an 8 & 12 year old  it had lots of room even with all there things with them in the tent. Can say it would be a little tight with two adults unless you don’t mind sleeping very close. With the blue tent and not the green it is a little darker in The tent during the day but not by much.

  First time camper here, I wanted a tent that was spacious and easy to put up by myself.  I wish it was a little longer, or wider, because air mattresses and cots are the exact same length/width so your feet are always up against the tent.  That is my only complaint. I’ve taken it camping 7 times now, and it has no signs of any wear or tear yet.  I’ve gotten poured on twice and not a drop of water got inside!  It’s perfect for my dog and me!

  This tent is great for the price.  I am able to fit my backpacking cot in here as well as my gear.  Theoretically two people could fit in here but it would be really cozy, and there wouldn't be room for gear.  I bought this for desert camping and the short rain - fly doesn't bother me as it mostly acts as a sun shade.  The only thing is that if you are taller than say 5'8"" and plan to use a cot, your toes might touch the opposite wall of the tent.  If you have a sleeping pad I think you can get away with a little more length.It has a nice hook up top, I attached a solar lantern onto it for use as a night light and it's great.I will have to see how it does in the rain but for a cheap tent that will be used in a dry climate, I am happy with the purchase.

  Took my 12 year old and I just 15 minutes to put it up the first time, by the second time we had it down to 6 minutes. Another minutes got the rainfly up and stakes in. Plenty of room for two queen-size inflatable mattresses plus gear. Very simple inside, two mesh pockets on each side, a small pass thru for electrical cords and lots of airflow. Makes me wish I had tents like this when I was a kid. Since we've only encountered beautiful weather I can't comment on its ability to repel water. Construction and ease of use, both putting together and taking down, are the biggest pluses. It did come with a small mat I assumed was for the entrance. Really too small for our use but it was a nice addition anyway. A couple times the zipper got caught on the overlapping door material. It was very easy to pull out the material and I wouldn't consider it to be an issue, we just needed to be more careful. I wouldn't mind another mesh pocket at the top apex of the tent, just for holding small lights/lanterns but I can't think of any other way to improve on this tent at this price. I would highly recommend.

  Despite the description, this only has ONE door.  It's well made for what you are paying for, if you want a tent that will survive high winds, get aluminum poles.  If you want a totally waterproof tent, pay for a high end tent.  This is a good tent for 2-4 people, I am 5'10 and can stand in the tent.

  The Coleman Sundome 4 person tent is very affordable at $54 (prices will vary) for what you get. First thing I noticed when unboxing it was that it is bigger than I had expected. I was very pleased with the size of the tent. 2 people will fit very comfortable with gear and even pets. You can fit a queen size air mattress with room for gear or 2 cots or twin air mattresses with gear and room to move around. When tents say 4 person or 8 or whatever number that means how many people you can physically fit laying side by side, head to toe on the floor to give you an idea of how big the tent is in comparison to an average person. It does not mean that is how many people should/could sleep comfortably. So, I would say in my opinion this is really a 2-3 person tent. And that is being comfortable with gear. It has 2 storage pockets one on each side, a loop hanging from the roof to attach a D ring and a light. It has a back ground vent to allow for good ventilation. It has large, halfway up mesh windows on all 4 walls. The back window zips closed and is fully enclosed once the fly is on for bad weather protection. It has very durable, thick, and tough materials that last a long time with good care and maintenance. I am disabled and can carry the whole tent with one arm. It was so simple for me to put it up and take it back down. I would highly recommend this tent. It would be great for beginners, disabled, young and old. It really is an awesome tent and so easy to use.

We also kept the green and white because we are nearly 60, our kids are now adults, and someday hopefully we will have grandchildren and I can envision family camping trips where grandma and grandpa are the cool grandparents with the camping equipment that matches that everyone can use.  Love this product, did thorough research before I purchased it on the Internet and in brick and mortar stores and if you are going to do Boy Scout trips, day hikes with a base camp for starting and ending point, or camping trips to tourist locations and camping grounds I cannot recommend this tent or the 2-person tents I bought highly enough to you.My wife and I used this on a trip to the Northwest to see Dave Matthews Band at The Gorge with my 26 year old son and his girlfriend, they had a much higher-tech backpacking tent, sleeping bags, etc. because they hike and backpack frequently.  Given the use, and the fact neither my wife or I had hiked since our kids were little (25 years ago) we were exceptionally comfortable, warm (temps got to low 40's overnight) without being too hot, and dry.  In short our experience was comparable to my son and his girl friend's for about a quarter of the cost of their high-tech equipment.Great value, very pleased with product and ordering and delivery - Amazon Prime was one of the better shipping decisions I have made.For a tent priced well below $100, I do not think you can find a better alternative.

  The tent was decently easy to assemble with one person (frustrating at times) but when you add a second person to assemble the tent, it was extremely easy and went up without a snag! On the very first use we put the water resistance of the tent to the test; it rained all weekend (including while I was setting up the tent) but the inside of the tent stayed dry - highly impressed! The vents help keep the humidity level inside the tent as low as possible.

  This tent is perfect for a solid entry level - just got it a few days ago for a long weekend - super easy to set up, and even though it rained all night, ours was the only tent in our group that didn't have any issues with getting wet.  We were able to leave all of the flaps open and didn't have an issue.  Easy to set up - we were able to fit a queen sized blow up mattress (Intex classic downy airbed set available from Amazon) and it was just barely able to fit length wise.  Just two of us slept in the tent, and there was still some room on both sides of the mattress for bags and coolers and everything.  If we didn't bring the air mattress 4 adults might be a little tight, but as a two person tent with a blow up mattress there was tons or room

  Went on a ~2 week car camping trip. Took it down and put it back up at least 5 or 6 times and it was just as easy every time! Takes maybe 5 minutes. Every time we put it up my boyfriend commented how easy it was. Highly recommend getting a tarp to lay down, as tarps are cheaper to replace than tents and it keeps it cleaner/less likely to get punctured or worn. Stayed put even with some heavier winds and didn't get wet inside when it rained! We did spray it with weather protectant spray from Walmart just for safe measures. Overall great quality, and great price. Would definitely purchase again.

  Easy to put up and great price.  I would use a tarp for heavy rain but it did really well.  It fits a queen size blow up mattress with room for my large suitcase, bottled water, camping games, portable lantern 10 magazines and still has room on the one side.  If you put the mattress in the middle of the tent you would have about a foot on each side.  Length is a tighter fit you only have about 10 inches at the end of the bed.  You can not stand up right in this tent unless you are a child.  The tent floor and about 6 to 8 inches up on all sides is a thick dark gray tarp type material.

It’s very easy to set up and break down, light weight, comfortably sleeps two, and we loved the pockets inside to hold small items.However, our tent did NOT keep out the rain. It leaked at the seams and we had to use towels and other clothes to soak up the water that was coming  in. We woke up in puddles of water.Overall very disappointed in this item. The manufacture video provided by Coleman says this tent fails their test if more than 2 tablespoons of water make it in and is guaranteed bone dry. This tent definitely FAILED.

  We love this tent!  We've taken it out for 3 camping trips so far.  It's easy to put up with 2 people and takes us no more than 20 minutes. We bring a queen sized air mattress and still have enough room to keep our bags inside and move around comfortably.  I feel like 6 people would be tough in here.  I personally wouldn't push it past 4 as I feel like that would be kind of a tight squeeze and definitely hot in the summer.  But then again, I am a little spoiled and like to have a lot of room in the tent when camping.  The little breeze vents are nice but the thing that has wowed me the most is how great it is at keeping out the rain.  I've had a lot of camping trips get disrupted by rain.  I despise waking up in a rain puddle but this tent kept us dry, even in during a pretty wild thunderstorm with heavy rain and wind.  The key is that the seams are up higher on the walls than on any tents that we've previously owned.  It's genius.  Most of the top is mesh so it's hard to have any privacy if the ran fly is off, but that also means a great cross-breeze and view of the night sky if you don't mind being visible to people outside.  It's not hard to pack away either.  I'd definitely recommend it to others.

  I just put this tent through the ringer in Eastern North Carolina for 3 nights on the beach on Cape Lookout National Seashore. It was a good tent for the price and I was happy with how it stood up in the wind. I do want it to be known that the mesh is not a true micro mesh. Therefore one night the no-see-ums or sand flies got through the mesh and mauled me pretty bad. So be aware that if you live in a place that has midges or sand flys or biting gnats or anything of that size the mesh on this tent will not stop them from getting in. Besides that, setup was easy as could be the rain fly was decent. air flow was a bit rough but a solid tent on a budget.

  It's decent if you only go camping once or twice a year and nothing too wild. It will leak in rain, material only tends off rain for a short shower but anything more than that water will pool in the corners and the seams need to be waterproofed by you.

  This is a great little tent! I've used this tent a few times now and have absolutely no complaints. Setup is a breeze and can easily done by one person. It sleeps two comfortably and could accommodate three, if need be. I've used a full size air mattress in the tent and there was still plenty of room for my stuff/gear, so a queen size air mattress should fit with no problem. The vents allow air to flow nicely through the tent, which keeps it cool inside and prevents the air from getting stale. So far, it has remained fairly cool in the morning (at least until 8am), even with the sun beating down on the tent.The rain fly on this thing is awesome! The last time I used this tent it poured rain for two days, with strong winds (gusts more than 20 mph). The tent stayed put and the inside of the tent remained totally dry, even when the winds changed direction. This alone makes it worth every penny to me.

I would suggest getting the larger version of the tent to have extra space if you plan on  using a queen sized inflatable mattress.  I used this on a two day camping trip in the California desert during the summer, so regarding how it performed in the elements, this review will not correspond to most.

  I hesitated buying this tent because of the price tag. I was worried that the tent would not hold up to moderate use. Fortunately, my hesitation was unnecessary. This tent works great for what it is.This tent is great for car camping and also backyard camping if you have kids. It could be used for hiking if you have another person to split the load with. It is not really designed as a hiking tent, though, so don't be surprised if it's a great deal more bulky than a tent that costs 4-6 times as much.Both my wife and I fit comfortably inside the 2-person tent. I am slightly over 6 feet tall, and I do not feel cramped. If you are taller than 6', you could still use this tent and sleep diagonally. Obviously this would make the tent effectively a one person tent with plenty of room for gear.This tent is $50.

There is one more bar that works the exact same, if you want the rainflap on.  Every zipper, every seam was perfect on mine, and I had it up and put away, literally, in minutes (like 3-5).  Two built in net-pockets are inside, one on each side, perfect for food or flashlights, etc.  It comes with a nice case to carry it all along - this one's worth it.Like any tent - this is only for 3 men if you want to sleep arm to arm, and at least one is short, ha!

  Easy to set up, easy to break down. Camped in it for 4 nights and 5 days, two of those nights it poured for hours and we had 0 leaks. The bottom of the tent is made of tarp material and we probably didn't even need the tarp we used underneath. The only catch is that if you press up against the sides of the tent, you will absorb rain and/or dew from the outside, we noticed this with a pillow that was a bit damp from being up against the wall.Slept 2 people on a twin Coleman air mattress comfortably with plenty of room for bags and such (could easily fit a queen size). It's also tall enough to comfortably sit up in, even for those over 6ft tall. I loved the built-in hanging pockets on the two side walls, I put my glasses and knick knacks in there to keep them safe overnight. This is very much a summer tent and therefore you should bring a sleeping bag or blanket as a matter of course (Mid-Atlantic area here).

  My boyfriend and I just came back from a five day camping trip to Glacier, and we used this tent. For the money, I think it's a pretty good buy! There were only two issues that we ran into. One, the rain fly pole seemed a little too long for the actual rain fly, so we could only insert one end of the pole into the pocket no matter what we did. It still stayed on well and it wasn't a huge deal, but I think if you're paying for something like this everything should be proportioned correctly. Two, it isn't something you can use when you're minimal camping (backpacking, smaller car). The packaging is fairly large and rectangular. It didn't rain much at all while we were there, but I would recommend using Seam Seal if you'll be camping anywhere with rain. The size was perfect for my boyfriend and I (and small campsites too), but with two people you wouldn't be able to comfortably fit any bags in there, which wasn't an issue for us since you have to put practically everything into your car in Glacier. Overall, I think this is a really great tent for the money! Just make sure you set it up when you get it and make sure to exchange it if you find that everything isn't proportioned correctly.

  WE used this tent on vacation for a couple of weeks. We moved nearly every night to a new location so we took it up and down a lot!. It withstood a very hard rain with no water entry. It dries fast, super easy to put up and take down.  Nice roomy storage bag for it all that is not like putting a puzzle together to get it to fit back in. The price is good! We had an adult and two pre-teens sleeping in it, there was all the clothes bags as well.  Wasn't too crowded for all that. I think it might be tight for four adults though. I highly recommend this tent.

  Surprised by the amount of room and the quality of the fabric. The stakes for the ground are on the thin side, so if you have some rocky ground to camp on you might need better stakes. Good against the wind and light sprinkles- I have not been in full on rain in this tent yet. Very pleased with the quality so far. Directions are not clear- took me a couple of mistakes to realize exactly what is was trying to show, but once you figure it out, it is really easy to assemble the tent.

  Been meaning to write about this tent for a while now especially because this tent practically made my summer, so here’s my two cents: I was skeptical at the low price of this tent- but two music festivals and a few small camping trips later- I’m beyond satisfied, and would purchase this tent again if I needed to—- but no need to because it’s  easy design and sturdy construction gives me the impression I’ll be living out of this tent again next festival season. It’s spacious, airy, rain resistant, and soooooo easy to assemble. By the third assembly my boyfriend and I made it a goal to see how quickly we could assemble and disassemble and I think the fastest was under 15 mins each way (including bickering) and repacking it into the carry case. He’s 6’2 and could stand comfortably in the center. The one very slight annoyance is the zipper flap often gets caught in the zipper- but hey, nothing’s perfect- but for the price this tent is a steal! Enjoy.

  The tent arrived yesterday. Set it up this morning to seal the seams for a cub scout camping event next weekend. Noticed the the rainfly is coming apart as if the material is rotted. You can run your finger gently across the fabric which is VERY thin and it just separates. We have camped numerous times in our Coleman Red Canyon 8-person tent with no problems.

  Very well built tent with plenty of ventilation. Easy to set up as well. Does get chilly inside if it is cold (used it in 50-60ish degree weather). The tent itself was designed for 4 people, and it is big enough to accommodate 4 adults, but it might get a little crowded. Around 2-3 will be better especially if you consider other items such as backpacks, sleeping bags, etc. With 2 people, the tent has more than enough space and is surprisingly roomy and comfortable. I will definitely recommend this tent, especially if you are on a budget and plan to use it during Spring, Summer, and early Fall (Winter is too cold to use this tent). Finally, the rainfly does help cover two of the ventilation to keep the cold out and provide cover when it rains (have not used it in rain yet). It is up to you to setup the rainfly or not. Without it, you basically have a ""sunroof"" and be able to see the sky when inside the tent.

  1. You can find all the good things about this tent in other reviews. I just wanted to point out that this tent has full-size vent windows at the 2 sides of the tent which you cannot close (unlike zippable front/back windows).Because of that, if you are going to camp in an area where the temperature drops below 66'F, you are going to need a lot of clothes for good night sleep. Still, you are going to have to face a chilly wind blowing into your face, while you are trying to sleep.I wouldn't recommend this tent for other than summer camping where the weather stays above the 70s degrees at night & early morning.2. Also, just after 2 uses, few of the pole parts are kinda bent, and I think I will be lucky to use this tent two or more times.

We have a family of 5 and we all fit in it very comfortably. At first it is a little bit difficult to figure out how to open up and put away if you're not used to using tens but like anything once you do it 2 or 3 times it becomes very routine and easy. It also fits into a very small carrying bag that you can fit onto an airplane carry-on storage or even in the front seat of your car or anywhere for that matter. Highly recommended.

Only reason I'm giving 4 instead of 5 stars is because I was missing one stake (needed to fully secure the tent into the ground), also because one of the black fabric loops were broken and last because the directions were a little difficult to follow (especially for someone who's never assembled a tent before) since there were only pictures and no step by step sentences/instructions. None of these caused a major problem with the tent and I was still able to use it and will use again in the future. I would still recommend this tent to a friend.

  We bought this tent about two and a half years ago to start camping as a family. We've used it about 5 or 6 times since then. It's been amazing. We get 2 adults and 2 children inside with plenty of room left over for gear. It is easy to set up with 2 people. The best part is how it holds up in rain. Every time we have gone camping, it has rained on us, and we have never had any leaks or flooding. And one of our trips, it basically rained the entire weekend. I spray the seams every once in a while with sealant, but the weather tec system with the waterproof bottom does a great job of holding out the water. I won't buy another Coleman tent that doesn't advertise this feature. The only real con is the rain fly. I wish it were a full rain fly like the ones when I was a kid, but it seems like all of them are shorter these days. Overall, this is a great tent for an amazing price!

This little tent is so good in fact, it is now my ""go to"" tent in our camping gear. I prefer it over our 6-man pop up tent because it's almost just as easy to set up, definitely easier to break down, and so much easier to put back in the attic afterward. Although the footprint of the 6 man is huge, there is practically the same amount of usable sleeping space due to the 3-man coleman's straight wall design. You really can fit three people in there, comfortably. Tall people too- we are short but use the extra space at our feet for our huge dog. You can't go wrong with this tent.

  Nice tent, But NOT Three seasons!We just got back from a camping trip on October 12, 2014.  It got cold; into the lower 30s.The problem with this tent is the large mesh windows on two sides.  These windows take up half the walls and, at night, provides a steady stream of air flowing over your body.  In the summer, this is a nice feature; not so much in the fall.  The venting is smaller and higher up on other tents I have had.  This tent does not hold heat and, even with the air flow, everything was damp inside the tent in the morning.  My son was warm sleeping in two sleeping bags and a winter hat.  I was a little colder as I only had one sleeping bag.What would make this tent great is if it had zippered enclosures over that mesh, as it has on two of the sides.  But those two large mesh screens really hurt the performance of this tent is colder weather.  Other than that, the tent is a great size--good for two people, two slim air matresses (not twin) and all of the gear.  Easy to set up.  Tall enough that you can stand in the center and relatively light and compact.I just wish it had a way to close off some of that venting.  But, that's what you get for the price.

  I usually don't take the time to write reviews, but this tent is awesome.  I'm in my third summer car camping around Yellowstone and outlying areas.  Each year I had it out for 20ish days.I'm usually in the parks as soon as campsites open in the spring, and until they close for the season in the fall.  It has seen storms, rain, hail, snow, freezing temperatures - taking it all with minimal leaking.Yellowstone and GTNP have some pretty strict bear storage regulations, so I sleep w/o any gear in the tent.  This means that there is less stuff to touch the tent walls during a rain.  YMMV in the rain with the tent full of people and stuff.Nearing the end of my third summer using it, the poles are starting to bend, especially the rain-fly.No tarp, and no waterproofing.  When setting up, all four corners are pulled tight and staked down.  The rain-fly is also pulled tight to make sure water has a way to flow down quickly.  Don't skip any of the steps!  Make sure all attachments are used/staked down and the tent is pretty solid.I'm also sure to always put it away dry.  After I get back home from a weekend of camping, I hang it over a railing until it's completely dry.My only complaint is that 3-people is a bit of a stretch.  3 people will be a very snug fit with zero room for gear.  I would call it a 2ish person tent.

  For camping, weather proofing is crucial. Unfortunately, I can't speak to that because we always camp in southern Utah where it barely ever rains. However, the 10x10 tent is awesome for a family to sleep in. I'm 6'0"" and I can stand up in it, and it is fairly easy to set up especially for a tent this large. It's probably a two person job that can be done in under 5 minutes. This is also important to note, the tent actually fits in the bag that they give you, which is really nice.

The zipper seems well constructed, it was easy to set up. The tent is very airy even with the fly on so it’s not so great for our chilly, Oregon foothills camping.

I tried to crimp it but the edges remain sharp. Can't get a replacement without paying for it as it is out of warranty. I think for a one time use for it to break is pathetic.Same with the self inflating mat I bought from Coleman. After two uses it now deflates and we can't find the spot. And again out of its one year warranty. Not a good testament of the quality of its products. It was purchased for a cub scout and that's why it hasn't been used more consistently and therefore the defects not found out. Not sure I am going to continue with Coleman.

  I purchased the Green version of this tent for my twice a year weekend camping trips to replace the Taj Mahal sized hand-me-down tent I had been using previously. What struck me about this tent at first was how much smaller it was than I was used to, which was a good thing. Even better, I could set it up fairly quickly with an incredibly minimal amount of cursing and stomping. It rained moderately that weekend and the fly worked as advertised and I had zero water inside the tent. It also came with a small rectangular patch of tarp material that I can only assume is supposed to work as a Welcome / Door mat. My guess is that it would work great as a place to take your shoes off before you get into the tent, but only when it isn't raining. When it is raining or has rained, it really just becomes a convenient place for water and mud to collect right outside your door. The interior is spacious and vented incredibly well. I had no issues with condensation inside the tent and I was fairly comfortable the entire time. At the end of the weekend, taking down the tent was just as easy as putting it up. I was able to break it down, fold it up, and even fit it all back into the bag it came in, which is something I've never been able to do. I usually revert to a nice trash bag for storage.I have to say, for a weekend camping experience, this tent is hard to beat for the price.

Easy to set up, as my wife and sister with arm in a sling put it up in no time. Now putting it back in the bag is akin to folding a road map. Takes a couple times to figure it out. Key is fold it to a width shorter than the bag and roll it up. I would have given it 5 stars, but the stakes are pretty crappy. They say it is a backpack tent, but it's pretty heavy for that. We have a Sierra Design that weighs a fourth of this one and roughly half the size and we think it's heavy. I can't imagine carrying this beast for a week.

  I am usually quite particular about my camping equipment, but I took the tent out for a three-day trip and its performance far exceeded my expectations. Definitely impressed with the sleek, simple-to-assemble design and its ability to keep out rain and all kinds of moisture. Also, the ground vent is a really neat feature and the bag is perfect size YET just to be that much better, Coleman made it possible to expand it even more by ripping a seam, just to assert their dominance as a tent manufacturer. A bold move, Coleman. In my opinion, the tent is worth more than $60 for a one-man tent (two is stretching it). My only complaint is it could be just a little bit longer, as I am only 5'10"" and my feet were flat against the back of the tent. If you sleep at a diagonal it helps but that would be a bit awkward if you add in a second person. Overall, would recommend.

  I used this for the better part of last summer and it was a great tent. After reading other reviews I used some seam sealer before first use and I assume it either did its job or I didn't need it; either way the seams didn't leak.The tent is very spacious for two (did not try it with three) but there seems to be ample room for a third if needed. I usually buy a three person for two people for the added storage space for packs and what not as I'm sure a lot of others do as well.The ventilation is great for muggy nights but I did make a mistake the second night I used it because I was on a bit of a slope and we had some sideways rain that night that found its way under the rain cover and into the tent. Luckily it wasn't a lot but it was pretty unfortunate sitting there watching the rain drip in from the mesh. That was another reason why I know the seams didn't leak because all the water stayed inside! I haven't had a problem with rain other than instance so the rain cover does work, just not under those particular conditions.The durability seems to be above average. I am slightly concerned the poles may break after a summer or two but as long as I'm cautious and don't stress them too much then I think it'll be fine.The setup is extremely easy and straight forward. I have set it up at night a few times and it was just as easy as setting it up in daylight for me. The hooks on the tent are really convenient for stretching it out to the poles and work well.Overall this was a great purchase for me and I hope to use it for several summers as long as I don't do something dumb and rip it or something. I really wanted the previous orange version but wasn't able to get it for the lower price of this one even though it is the exact same tent. Oh well, the green looks good regardless!

I set it up on a polythelene rip stop camo tarp and put a canvas tarp inside, then sealed the interior seams (it's inverse stitch for water proofing, but I always seal anyway) and about an hour latter it started to rain.

  I have had tents from Coleman in the past and know they are of decent build quality. I can say this tent is no exception. It is a breeze to set up, even alone in under 10 minutes. I bought the 3 person and it was able to fit a queen sized air mattress with plenty of storage room along the side for myself and my girlfriend. The second night of use the sky opened up and even in an absolute downpour not a drop came through. I like the fact that it has a floor vent to keep air flow up and even with the windows zipped down, no water came through under the rain tarp. The only thing I am concerned about in longer use is the flooring material seems a bit thin. I put my on top of a tarp and even on rough rocky ground it seemed to hold up fine but just something to keep in mind. This is a great tent although if you are backpacking definitely look elsewhere as it is not ultra portable. Also this was summer camping so I have no opinion how this would hold up to snow or extreme cold.

  This tent began ripping on our 3rd set up. We were in great weather: no wind or rain. On the top, a hole has been sliced in the fabric that holds the support poles. One of the fiberglass poles also began splintering. We aren’t rough on tents and we set them up properly. Very disappointed in the lifespan of the tent. It is large enough to accommodate 5 sleeping pads, or 4 and a walkway. It was cool during the day and not too hot at night. But if it isn’t going to hold up for more than 2 set ups, it is not worth the money.

  I took this to a Bluegrass festival for three days on Oahu.  First time I have slept in a tent in over thirty years, but this tent was fine.  Very easy to set up and take down.  I like the two storage pockets inside, too.  It was just me and my guitar, mandolin and duffel bag in the tent, enough room.  Two people could fit, but then I think the gear would have to stay outside.  It didn't rain, so unfortunately I can't say how waterproof it is...  I recommend this one!  (there were other Coleman tents too, all sizes.  People seemed to really like them!!)Update, almost 5 years later: I still love this tent! I have used it 9 times since I purchased it, 8 out of the 9 times it RAINED. Tent stayed fairly dry on the inside, maybe a tiny bit of leakage in the seams the last time I used it. There was also condensation, but that couldn't be helped, considering the humidity. I am about to use it again next week; this time I sprayed it well with water-proofing, both top, fly, and bottom.I have to say it is a little tricky getting in and out of--I am 5'6"", not a spring chicken... my next tent will have a better entry, with more of a cover.6 months later: This little tent survived a DELUGE over the weekend: about 4 inches of rain DUMPED on us (I wasn't in it at the time) and it came through with flying colors! Just a tiny bit of seepage around the edges. Amazing. The ground was very boggy, I had a tarp under the tent, and all was good! Definitely 5 stars for this little gem!PS: I would recommend this for one person plus gear. I think 2 people plus gear would be too crowded. If you can store your stuff elsewhere, then it would work, but I camp alone, and would not want anything smaller.

  Coleman is well-known for the quality of its products. I thought the top of the tent was sealed, but it's not - there is a portion of the top of the dome that is mesh, which is nice if you want ventilation and to have a view of the sky. There's also a rain fly to put over the top to cover the mesh in case it does rain.  This was no fault of Coleman's though - just my ignorance and I hope it helps some of you better prepare by determining if this is the right tent model for your adventures. Good for outdoors, good for the rain, Aside from that, the tent was sturdy and I was able to put it together by myself in about 10 minutes. There are side pockets on the inside, and there's placement to hang a lantern from the center on the inside for light at night. The description says its a 4-person tent, and it probably could fit four ""average"" sized people tightly together without luggage, but it's good sizing for a couple with luggage, and maybe a third depending on how tall/big you all are. Highly recommend!

While the tent set up was everything they said it would be (less than 10 min for one person), the quality and craftsmanship of the tent were terrible. The stitching was unraveling on the rain fly in 2 places and there was a hole about half the size of a dime where the seams met in the back corner of the tent. I wrapped it up and asked for a refund.

  This tent was purchased as a gift for my daughter's 5th birthday. We do a few small camp outs a year, and one big festival every year and she has decided that she is old enough to sleep in her own tent. We helped her set it up (fairly easy and straight forward assembly) last weekend on a camp out with friends at a state park. We put her in there on a regular twin air mattress which takes up all the length and 3/4 of the width. So far it seems pretty good for a child's first tent. We have not tested it out in rainy conditions yet, so I can't speak to that, but I do have a slight concern that the lower vent window (that does not close) would let some amount of rain in even if the rain fly is properly staked out. It also means that you will be nice and chilly if it is a windy, cool night because there is no way to keep the wind from coming right in over you as you sleep. Great feature in a hot summer, but not a bonus for other times of year. So, all in all, a great little tent for one person. Two might fit if you forgo the luxury of an air mattress, but you better be pretty friendly with each other. Great for summer camping (it seems) but that little vent window brings it down a star for us. I made my daughter sleep in with us on the second night of our trip because of a very windy cold front, and I'm glad she did. She would have been freezing in this tent. We were all cold enough in our tent which zips up tight against the wind.

The mattress take up all the space.  I'll get a second smaller tent to house our gear when were are out of camp (clothing, camp chairs, tables).

  First, the tent is spacious. I can stand up in the middle of the tent. While it's technically water resistant/water proof, it was also the only tent at the camp site to collapse and did so with the first gust of a thunderstorm rendering its water resistance useless. The zippers have degraded in quality since my last purchase of a Coleman tent, jamming at every attempt to open or close the entrance/exit. It would make a fine summer, back yard tent, but if you're planning on camping, be prepared to sleep elsewhere in a storm.

  Before you read the reviews, look at the price. This is a VERY reasonably priced tent, and its quality far exceeds its price. Sure, it's not the $400 tents that withstand -2000 degree weather and 3000 mph winds that you may find at REI or other camping stores, but it is the perfect car camping tent for a family of 3 or 4 who camps a few weekends throughout the year. It is light weight, takes up almost no space in the car, sets up incredibly easily, is easy to re-pack, withstands rain (it rained on me my second night using it) and high winds (camped on top of Dead Horse Point in Utah on one of the windiest September nights), and has two storage pockets and a lantern hanging hook within. I do not recommend it for backpacking as it is too big to carry in your pack, but if you are like me, and prefer camping 10-15 days out of the year from your car, this is the tent for you. I anticipate it will last me multiple years. Fantastic value!One note -- I threw a heavy rock into the internal tent corner to anchor it down while setting up, and unfortunately, it hit another rock beneath it and slightly tore the bottom tarp. That being said, this is human error - not tent error - but be careful nevertheless.

    Rain battle tested, but annoying pole-sleeve design and overpriced.
  
",3.0,Marcel,"Reviewed in the United States December 22, 2014","









  
  
    
  Update 4/2017I find the ""tent pole sleeve"" design to be a huge pain compared to other tents that use plastic c-shaped fasteners to secure the poles to the body. With sleeves the poles always catch so you spend time pushing, wiggling, pushing, wiggling, until finally you get both poles through. Then repeat that annoying process for teardown. With c-connectors you can connect the poles to the corners and start connecting clips in whatever order you feel like. This is probably the #1 reason I won't buy this tent again.On the plus side, this tent has held up well in numerous heavy rainstorms. One time there were several inches of water outside but nothing came through!. The floor felt like a waterbed with the inch or so of water UNDER the tent. Quite impressed. However, 2 sides of the tent are screen mesh without any ability to close. In heavy storms with wind some mist will get inside. I got a little damp and it kept me from sleeping well, but I was mostly dry and plenty warm.In heavy wind at Big Bend and the beach you will need to tie additional guy lines to keep the tent from caving in. Unfortunately there aren't any connection points for this on the rain fly. I ended up looping rope under the fly and inside some of the tent pole sleeve openings, but it was far from perfect.-------------------------This ok tent is overpriced. My previous car-camping tent was the 9'x9' Timber Creek Cumberland II Dome Tent that cost $35 from Academy. It worked great for about 5 years until the door zipper blew out. I could probably get it fixed but I decided to ""level up"" and get this coleman tent. I figure it costs 2.5x more, it must have great zippers, seams, design, etc. Well I must say I'm disappointed. I should have just bought another Timer Creek.Cons:The Coleman tent BARELY fits my queen airbed. It has to go in sideways (long direction faces the door), which means one person has to climb over the other person. In this configuration one of the handy storage pockets hangs in your face, the other gets whacked by your feet. My Timber Creek tent had a clever ""attic"" mesh storage that was great for things like a headlamp, glasses, etc. The Coleman has a small round plastic loop that could be used to hang something, if you remember to bring some string or a very small carabiner. ""4 person"" is a HUGE stretch, it is really a 2 adult tent, and even that will feel a bit cramped.Pros:Very easy to set up. I like the way the rain fly cantilevers over the front and back using a pole, providing good rain drainage for the screened windows, as well as shade. The rain fly system seems to be well designed to make minimal contact with the tent for maximum time before ""wetting out"".

  This is a very nice tent.  We set it up for the first time on the campsite (without testing it first) and it went up very easily.  Shortly after setting it up it poured rain for hours, and the tent stayed dry, even as water was pooling in the site.  All of the seams and zippers seemed to be well-made.  It also has a really nice look to it.The only (slightly) negative aspect is that it is not really designed for cold weather.  The tent is very airy and the rain fly protects from rain, but due to the open space between the rain fly and the windows it doesn't retain any warmth.  This is NOT necessarily a bad quality, unless you plan to camp in very cold weather all the time and come unprepared.  We used it in mid-September and unfortunately had a spell of temps in the 30's overnight.  In warm weather this would be perfect!Overall, I would definitely recommend this tent!

  I bought this a few years ago as the tent that I had was pretty old and a huge pain to set up.This tent is great.  it's not as lightweight as some of the more expensive tents - so it's not that greatest for lightweight backpacking, but it's durable and a great tent to bring with for car camping.I had taken it on multiple trips and had always been great.It states it's a 3 person tent, and you can certainly fit 3 people in it for sleeping - but you won't be able to move around much.  I find it to be the perfect size for my girlfriend and I!It did get a tiny rip on the bottom on the first time I used it - but that was due to me setting it up on a stick and failing to completely clear out the area before setting it up.I had brough this with me to the everglades - and because it was green the tree frogs absolutely loved it.  Every morning I'd wake up to around 50 tree frogs perched on it.  Awesome!

  I got tired of asking friends to borrow there's and this was cheap. It worked for my needs but it is small. You have to subject 2 from the size the size they say. I'm 5'3"" and my mattress was pool float which is a lotta thinner than a twin.I'm single and short so it was perfect for my needs for this trip but idk how taller people can do this.It fit my cooler (mid size) and my backpack and a dry food bag and water gallon and my walkway out the 'door' was still clear.I had another bag that I didn't put inside. It would have been to crowed.Quality was good. Went up and down quick. I'm in SoCal. Summer. It didn't rain.

  I love this tent so much.  I had registered for a multi-day bike ride, and was in fairly last minute need of a tent.  I'm not a big camper (yet) and had never owned my own tent before, so I, like so many of my peers as it turned out, took to the internet to buy the cheapest tent I could find.  To my surprise, the first night of the ride it absolutely POURED rain.  While many people had leaky roofs or corners of their tents, I was cozily tucked away under my tent's rain fly, with not a single drop on me.  The very edges of the tent did get a little dewy, but nothing more than that.I landed on this Coleman 3-person tent, which was incredibly roomy for one, and fit two people and their gear snugly but comfortably.The tent was simple and easy to set up, and the bottom of the tent is itself a tarp, so while I still recommend buying/using a tarp of your own (this tent does not come with one), you will definitely be able to sneak by without it.  The tent was nice and airy and was great at keeping bugs out.  It's not terribly windproof and I certainly wouldn't use it in colder weather, but its an absolutely wonderful starter tent for those of us exploring our wilderness side!

  Great little tent. First time I’ve been camping in 30+ years, so I bit of a learning curve. This was a great tent. We had two twin inflatable mattresses with about a foot and a half of room between the two allowing for personal bags and such. The ventilation is great. We did encounter our fair share of rain and it held up nicely, but at a certain point we used an overhead tarp. It is not tall enough to fully stand up in- just a heads up. Super easy set up and break down, 10 minutes or less with two people. Would recommend.

  This tent is excellent for doing some quick car camping. The weatherproof features seem to have hold up while using it during a light downpour. Plenty of space with the 4 person option as well. Surprisingly the tent is pretty lightweight when packed up in the carrying case. I definitely recommend if you're doing weekend trips and not hiking long distances.

  Just got back from my first time using it. It was pretty light and easy to carry. Super easy to set up - don’t even think it took the 10 minutes it says it does.

It could snuggly fit two people who didn’t mind being close. And when it came to putting it away, everything fit back in the bag easily plus the separate tarp without even needing to expand the bag. Can’t wait to use it more.

  Had my tent for a few years now and it has held up very well. When rain cover is on correctly, tent is totally waterproof, even in high wind.

  I just used this tent for four nights on a car camping trip.  On the second night it rained fairly steady, and in the morning, all our stuff was bone dry, including a lot of flannel cloth that was touching the tent wall.  Others have mentioned a design flaw in the velcro clips on the under side of the rain fly.  They are in the wrong place, so you have to clip them around the tent sleeve instead of just the pole.  It was workable, but they should fix it.  The rain fly is otherwise very well designed.

  I love this tent! I am horrible at setting up tents but this was very easy, first time did it by myself in about 10 minutes. Considering the price it’s a great deal and will work perfect for amateur campers or for festivals.I noticed some people rated it lower due to getting wet but you just gotta use common sense. I always spray with seam seal (1 can will cover rain guard twice, main tent once), and I always bring a tarp to layout underneath the campsite. I’ve had no problems yet. The only thing is that it’s so easy because you only use 2 poles for the tent. It’s held up fine in wind so far but if your looking for a tent to use in extreme weather this may not be it.

  So I bought this 4 person tent for me and my fella to go camping for a weekend at a state park campsite.Pros:We had a queen air mattress that fit with plenty of space for our belongings and to move around without feeling like a sardine. It rained all weekend. I mean it POURED and this sucker kept us dry.It seemed to be a well made tent. The bottom is a tarp like material. The whole tent was easy to assemble and seemed sturdy.  And it packs down pretty small and was easy to store.Cons:It did sweat with the temperature change (it was a 50° change after above rain shower) and anything pressed up against the side was damp. Any tent would probably do this honestly.The rain cover doesn’t leave you much space to leave your shoes outside of the tent without getting wet. (The eureka apex 2xt rain cover/ tent is great about this)And I wish there was a door/ vent on both sides.But overall, as an amateur camper I found this to be a great purchase. And would recommend it to anyone looking for a well made, reasonably priced tent.

  This (six person) tent was perfect for giving my kids enough space to have their two twin air mattresses and still have room for their bags and not be on top of each other.  As a 6'2"" adult, it wasn't quite big enough for me to stand up in, but I got this for the kids anyway, and they have no such problem.It actually poured rain the first night that I used this, and it stayed reliably dry inside.  Can't ask for more than that.The directions for this tent were pretty straightforward, save for the fly pole.  It runs along the top from the front (entrance) to the rear, unlike most I've seen, that form an arch above the entrance.  It's possible that my expectations tainted my experience though.I took off one star because of the instructions, the weight, and the color (meh).  Still, it's a great value for the price.  While a bit heavy for backpacking, it packs up into a very small package, so it's great for trunk camping, which is as rugged as I like to get.  I have no buyers remorse, and would definitely buy this again.

  Overall, really great tent. Super super easy to set up, one person could do it on their own very easily. The only thing I don't like is that it has 2 huge mesh windows that don't have zip up covers on them. If you want any privacy at all, you have to put on the rain fly, which doesn't seem like it would keep the rain out very well. I'm not sure that 4 adults could comfortably sleep in here, though. My husband, daughter, and myself slept in here just fine, but another person would have been way to cramped. Other than that, this tent was exactly what we needed.

  I used this tent last year for a hiking trip. It's not the lightest weight tent I've seen out there, but for a budget minded person, it works well.  The tent isn't the best quality, but it works well in fair weather conditions.  I was the only person in my tent, and with my gear, it was about all you'd want to fit.  If you have two people wanting to fit in this tent, you may need to keep most of you gear outside.  The tent is very easy to setup and take down.  It packs away into a small space, and has a nice ""floor mat"" that you can use when you go in or out to put your shoes on.  In colder weather, this tent isn't much more than a wind shield, and even there, with the vent on the back side that you cannot close, its really hard to keep warm. Otherwise, it's a good starter tent for camping/hiking.

  This tent was amazing. I used it over the 4th of July weekend when I went camping and it was perfect. very nice and spacious, my boyfriend and I put a queen size mattress in there and we still had plenty of room. It was VERY DURABLE in different types of weather. we had it pour on us and no water or anything seeped in which was very nice. The side windows are also very helpful when its 90 degrees and you need some air flow! Very pleased with this purchase & highly recommend!

This tent didnt even do that. It was rock solid and very dry (aside from my shoes that i left outside). It was also very cool even with the high humidity. Definitely worth the purchase.

  Great value here! $50 bucks for a heavy duty car camping tent from a name you can trust (China lolz!) anyway, this tent is well designed by the Coleman company. It is  made to good specs,seam sealed . Perfect amount of room for (2) people and some gear.  Center height is comfortable for 2 people to sit upright (at the same time!) for dressing,playing cards or whatever. It assembles fairly quick, ""BUT"" the shock cord used in the poles is VERY THIN and will most likely fail within a couple of set ups. I intend to replace it asap. 4 stars because of that.

  So far I've only used this tent once, but it was a good experience.  Tent package is a bit bulky, but you can eliminate the carrying bag and store more compactly on your own.  Like most dome tents setup was easy.  It is well constructed and kept out bugs and rain.  Keep in mind that although this is a 2 person tent and it will only hold 2 people and your sleeping bags.  there is not any extra room.  I know this may sound like common sense, but just wanted to make it clear.  You won't be able to fit your gear inside with you.  For one person, this tent is fantastic and has enough room for all your gear.  Overall,  a solid product at a great price and I would definitely purchase again.

  This tent is pretty sweet. I bought it to go camping (obviously) for my wife and I. Now that our son is old enough to be in his own tent I was tired of putting up an 8 person, 3 room, 15 year old tent. I wanted something light and easy to set up. This met all my needs. It is easy and I can set it up by myself in 10 minutes. The included canopy to go over it when it's raining or what not was a nice bonus as well. It is very lightweight and folds nice and small. The only thing I didn't like was that it says three person but it really only fits 2 comfortably. It can fit 3 if you're all touching each other.

  The first time we used this tent we got it set up minutes before the rain started.  It rained very hard for about 12 hours. We and all of our gear stayed dry all night!  We spent five nights in the tent that trip and had no complaints.It's easy to set up and the directions are clear. I love that they are attached to the bag so they cannot get lost. Like all tents, you really need to upgrade the stakes.  The ones that come with this tent are very thin and bend easily; for a few dollars get some decent ones.

  The tent does what a tent should do. It kept me sheltered from the wind and rain and housed whatever equipment I didn't what outside.

",5.0,Talya,"Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2013","









  
  
    
  First of all, don't buy this for 4 people (unless you buy 2), but you probably already know that. It fits 2 nicely. It could probably fit 3 if they are all using sleeping bags and don't need much space for belongings.This tent worked really well for us (2 adults and a small dog). We were able to fit a queen airbed and still had room for our stuff (suit cases, coolers, bags of snacks, etc).We used 

  
Intex Classic Downy Queen Airbed









  
  
    
  . Since the tent is more of a rectangle than square, we found that our airbed could fit loosely one direction, or tightly in the other. We chose the tighter fit, with the foot of the bed toward the door, because this gave us more room on the other side of the tent for our stuff.Setting it up is fairly easy. It took us a while the first time, but we were in the very, very dark, late at night, using flashlights for the directions and setup. The fact that we succeeded in those conditions should testify to it's simplicity.And I'm so happy I bought a tent with a rain fly, because yes of course it rained. Just to be safe, we put a tarp under the tent, because I hear it's a good habit. The walls of the tent seemed to get a little moist, but it felt like condensation. Overall, we stayed dry. So we are pleased with this tent.

  Firstly, with any and all tents, I recommend laying a tarp down first to prevent condensation and potential tearing. No tent floor will be sufficient to withstand a sharp rock or stick if you miss it when clearing ground.The ventilation in this tent is superp, it's withstood insanely hot Florida summers and kept me as cool as you can really get. It's been through a literal monsoon without a single leak and kept me dry all night, The entry way is big enough to enter and exit with relative comfort and the zip up windows along with the rain fly afford reasonable levels of privacy.The one improvement I would suggest would be to make the rear vent (as of now, it's a stake out or stake in setup) a zip and stake. The campsite I was at during the monsoon flooded and the water was just a hair below that vent entry. Would have been a mess.

The tent weathered it perfectly and in the morning, the interior was dry. After the rain, the humidity levels rose.

  This is my first tent, so I can't compare, but it served me well on my camping trip.  I bought the three person tent for two people, so we had extra room for stuff and didn't feel crowded.  Our sleeping pads took up the entire width of the tent, but we could have fit one more next to it, if we needed to, but there wouldn't have been much room for stuff.  The bottom of the tent is thin so I placed a tarp underneath to protect it.  It is hot to sleep in the tent with the windows zipped shut, which I tIried to do for fear of rain.  Finally I opened them and when the rain did begin, none of it came inside.  It wasn't a huge storm, but it was a pretty steady rain for an hour or more.  It is easy to put up as long as the ground isn't too rocky, but worthwhile to set it up in advance of a trip if you're a beginner, so you know what you're doing.

  Wonderful tent. Very easy to build and pack down. Slightly smaller than expected based on reviews and appearance. Fiancee and I are both 5 ft, and we brought both our 40 pound dogs. All of us just barely fit comfortably inside. Even at 5 ft, we had to duck to dress or stand, except when in the very center spot, and then our  heads almost touched the top. However, it kept rain out amazingly, and was great with the zip open flaps and the easy build and tear down. Definitely recommend. Amazing for the price. Just know what you're getting, if you're a normal height, rather than a hobbit. ;)

  I went camping on Memorial Day with this tent and it turned out to be a miserably stormy weekend. After 3-4 downpours to the point were our campsite was an insufferable mud pit, the inside of my tent was bone dry. Of course, the next time I take it out the waterproofing will need reapplied. But I was very impressed with how it held up during the multiple rains on its first outing. It's important to note that this tent size can fit a standard air mattress and nothing else. If you need more room, then you'll need to size up. It has nice hanging pockets where I kept my glasses, power bank, and phone. Great tent that was insanely quick to set up and kept me and my things dry.

    In ancient Rome they issued Coleman tents to the Legion...

  I've used much more expensive tents over years of camping but I find I keep the Coleman stuff around more than others. While not as high tech or ultra-lite as many of their competitors, they've mastered simple, easy to use products that are both inexpensive and of good quality. I've literally camped in a version of this tent for so long the bathtub floor was starting to get a little thin from the air mattress rubbing on it. (Like 4-5 years of scouts use). Coleman products just seem to keep going where other stuff breaks. I've got a 1980s lantern and dual fuel stove that have hundreds of hours on them and still work as good as the day I bought them.This 2 person tent is no exception. I've had this same tent in several models (this same footprint in a model called ""Traditional"" is what almost all the cub scouts were issued in the 90's and 2000's). It's still available with several names and colors but the 5' by 7' floor plan is pretty much the same.This is a tent and shares characteristics of most dome tents. Two long poles cross in the middle and are tensioned into an arc and thereby hold up the dome. It comes with a good rainfly that still allows the back window and front door to be mostly open during a rain storm. Nothing worse than being zipped up in a tent, in July, in a thunderstorm, with NO ventilation...this one has good ventilation. The top is mostly mesh under the rainfly (""SUN""dome) so you lose a lot of privacy with it off. I keep it on for that and the random showers. There's also a lower vent you can peg open for even more ventilation. Tent was of good quality and construction. All seams were even and straight. No extra material hanging off or tape not trimmed. Tent was clean and smelled new (some people have been getting Amazon return ones but mine was new from factory). Set up is like every small dome, two main poles that hold up tent, smaller pole for rainfly, CRAPTASTIC tent pegs (purchased good aluminium 9"" ones with tent). Goes up in about 10 minutes. I ALWAYS suggest a ground tarp. I also routinely use a hanging tarp over the tent if I can. I use this with the Coleman 10x10 Screenroom (another small bag, easy to carry Coleman product). Great to carry in my camper for an emergency or for the kids to borrow for a weekend trip.....at $36 bucks I should buy 3 or 4 of them and just stash them in the closet. Perfect for younger grandkids to camp in the back yard (my first grandchild is only 30 days old !!:) :).All in all it's a 5 Star ""worth the money'' product from Coleman.

  Got this for a Cub Scout Campout as we don't camp often and yet wanted something the right size, reasonably priced and good for spring/summer camping.With a trial run for working out the kinks, (the biggest being the rain fly) the second and subsequent setups took about 15 minutes each and easily done solo.While I'm not sure how well the open mesh sides covered by the rain fly would hold up in a big storm, it help up with a drizzle. We stayed dry and comfy if a bit warm for a WI summer night. Both of us were sleeping on top of our sleeping bags by morning.Not sure of long term durability and certainly not a backpack tent. I'd recommend buying a ground tarp and a set of good stakes just to make life easier for yourself.Overall a good basic tent that can easily sleep an adult and two kids with wiggle room and space for gear.

  It worked just fine for a very rainy 2 day camping adventure. We bought this for a music festival in Kentucky last September (2018). It rained the entire time we were there and inside the tent was dry. We did not use a seam sealer or anything. Plenty of room for a queen size inflatable mattress and our bags and large cooler. But, I must confess, next time we're using a 6 person tent and cots for more comfort. I'm 5 ft and could stand in the 4 person tent, but hubby is 6 ft and it's not as comfortable for him.

  I bought this tent for a bi-anual camping trip for me and my girlfriend to share. We didn't have time, unfortunately, to set it up before the trip so we prayed for the best that nothing was ripped. The tent was rather easy to set-up, taking me and her about 5 minutes following the easy to read instructions which are attached to the carrying bag. Unfortunately the tent wasn't as big as we expected. I feel that it would have felt a bit cramped with a queen sized blow up mattress in there in my opinion, but it was roomy enough for us two and our gear using blankets as bedding. Our tent has a small rip in the seams near the zipper, but other than that nothing was broken or missing. Folding the tent up and getting it back in its bag was a pain in the butt though, I chalk this up to me not knowing how to properly break down a tent though and will be looking into how to do this.Overall the tent was easy enough to put up with us two being relatively new to setting up tents and having no real problems. We had excellent weather all weekend so I can not comment on how it handles in the rain. I will be looking into how to properly fold a tent and will update my review.

  Cheap and decent tent. You get a fair amount of room on the inside. As always, never get this for 4 people. A four person tent fits two people max. I would say this is a huge con, however that's the standard sizing in the industry for whatever reason.Waterproofing wasn't great. We had leaking on all sides during our whole trip. It wasn't all too bad though and we had an air mattress so we slept well.

  May 29 & 30 2020 used this little beauty for a much needed out of the house weekend. The 29th was the worst. Rained in southwestern Pennsylvania the entire night. My 2 dogs (Shih tzu and 45 pound Heniz 57) and I were drenched. But our tent wasn't. Everything inside was bone dry. Decided to keep it that way and went back home leaving it sealed up. At 7:30 am the next morning went back to our setup nothing was out of place. Stayed all day and that night the 3 of us had a cozy night. Almost to  cozy. If you are by yourself with 2 furry friends I do suggest going up a size. Other than that you will not be disappointed. I am a 54 year old female and my first camping out in over 25 years.

  Used this on a recent camping trip with weather 30-50 degrees. It rained the last day and we had no problems with leaks, and we did not use seam sealer. This tent is easy to assemble, however we did complete a practice run before we took it camping. The instructions are helpful but still required us to do a little investigating of out own. I would definitely recommend getting better tent stakes, the stakes included are the small metal ""L-shaped"" ones. This model includes a hook at the top for hanging a fan/light and includes a pass-through for an extension cord. We fit a queen size mattress and had a 3 ft by 5 foot section of space on one side and a 2 foot by 5 foot space on the other side. It may be possible to set up 2 queens but they would leave no room for storage and the walls would touch a side of each mattress. I really found no cons with the product but we only used it for a single 5 day camp so far.  The tent is very easy to get back in the carrycase as well.

  Great tent for two people using a queen sized air mattress with room to spare for  clothes. Could almost stand straight up in the center of tent ( I am 5'x3"") which sure helps when getting dressed. The construction seems good with reinforced stitching at all pressure points and the bottom material comes up really high up all sides to help keep out moisture.  There are two things I always do with any tent and that is to buy more sturdy stacks as those thin metal ones can pull up more easily with wind gusts. It hasn't rained since using this tent so far, but I always cover my tents with tarps anyway as there is nothing worse than a damp sided tent in heavy rain!

  I'm preparing for a camping trip to the Rocky Mountains this summer. I bought this tent because it was in my price range and it seemed like a good size. When I bought it, I set it up in my living room. It took less than 10 minutes to set up  by myself (without reading the directions). I really like the top, it can be removed so that you may sleep under the stars. I bought the 3 person tent for 2 people (so we wouldn't be smooshed together). It was large enough for me (5'8) and my husband (6'2) to lay down comfortably with room to spare.

  I like almost everything about this tent. It's suitable for car camping in dry weather. I'd used it in the outdoors about 5x, then recently set it up in the backyard during an all-day rainstorm just to hang out and listen to the rain. I quickly developed puddles in all four corners of the tent. Water was apparently coming in through the seams of the tent itself -- I think the rainfly was fine.

If you're 6 ft, you'll need to lie diagonally to be comfortable.  If you're taller than 6'3"", you'll need a larger tent.

It stayed down strong, no tearing, no snapping poles, it held tight all night long. Then! In the middle of the night, it POURED for hours, serious rain. My friend's tents turned into swimming pools and they had to cram into their cars to sleep. My kids and I didn't get a drop of water on us. This tent stayed 100% dry inside. What an incredible tent!

Be advised that there are 2 large mesh panels in the ceiling of the tent that are covered with the rain fly installed, however if you're planning on camping in colder weather you may want to choose an alternate model without the mesh panels.

  So we all know that a two-person tent is actually a one-person tent, right?

Quick and easy to set up and take down on my own, easy to clean, sturdy, and it held up to a full night of hard rain-- things got humid, for sure, but I didn't actually get wet.I do wish that the window were bigger and that the door had a full-size mesh window (meaning, I wish the full door had a mesh interior door) for better ventilation and views when you're inside the tent.

The way the poles hook in is intuitive.  I generally prefer a tent that is a bit taller, but this one works fine.  It was large enough my son on a twin size air mattress, a St. Benard, and a Neufoundland to have a comfortable night's sleep!  It rained several times while we were out and the tent had no leaks, even in a downpour.  The tent seemed easy to clean after the trip was over.Note that this is not a 4 person tent in any reasonable sense.  If you have a family of 4, you will want a larger tent.  If you are taking a pack of kids camping and want to squeeze and many as possible into a space, then you could proably put 4 kids in the tent.PROS:  -  Easy setup  -  Reasonable cost  -  Well made for the price  -  Adequate ventilationCONS:  -  Could be a bit taller  -  Can be found slightly cheaper elsewhere if you look  -  No way is this a ""4 person"" tentOverall I was pleased with the tent.

  First, I'm not a camper.  I bought this after reading other reviews.  This is my first attempt at putting up a tent in 15+ yrs and even with a bad back this was a breeze.  I even did it inside in cramped quarters and I had no problems.  I didn't look at the directions, because I'm a man's man and was still able to accomplish this feat easily.  As stated previously I have a back injury and though not comfortable to get in and out, it was not difficult.  Room inside for two friendly friends but not so much as I would want to be in it with a buddy(you've never met my buddies so you wouldn't know,trust me).  I primarily purchased this tent to take with me on weekend trips so it had to fit in an older corvette, this does without problem.  It also fits easily back into its carrying case without having to smash it or reconfigure your folding operations.  We'll see how it does over the long haul but for the price I'll take a couple of seasons and be happy.

",5.0,Terrell Smith,"Reviewed in the United States September 18, 2011","









  
  
    
  I purchased this tent for a week-long camping trip to the Rockies. During the time camping, it rained almost every afternoon, and the tent never leaked. It also withstood wind which knocked over or collapsed other tents near us.It's quick and super easy to set up, doable with one person, but easier with two.Realize that when buying a tent, and it says a ""two person"" tent, it means two people who are very comfortable with being very close to each other. It's really more suited for one person, if you plan to have anything besides people inside the tent. The size as stated is the floor size, and as can be seen from the illustration, the walls curve up, so putting a single sized air bed (75""x39"" or 6.25'x3.25') inside, the air bed just fits, with almost no room at either end to spare.I find the little ""CoolAir port"" to be a bit strange, it's like a little doggie door. But it allows you to peek out while lying down.This is a wonderful tent for the price!I liked it so much, I bought the larger Coleman Sundome 6 for another camping trip. It easily sleeps 4 (all tents are rated for small people it seems), and it also held up well in the wind and rain.

  This tent is easy to set up and had plenty of room for 2 people. I liked the screened top (if you leave off the rain fly) so you can still see the sky when you settle in for the night. I have not tried it in any extreme weather yet but with some tent stakes and the rain fly, you should be ok in mild weather conditions. It's a bit heavy for backpacking, I'd recommend for car camping type situations.

  It's probably closer to a 2-3 man tent, but it was easy enough to put together my 6 year old son had no trouble helping me. We easily fit a full size and twin sized blow up mattresses with room to spare. The bag says it fits a queen size air mattress, but you ain't getting that puppy thru the door inflated unless you can taco bend it. The weather was perfect for our backyard camp out, so I cannot attest to it's weather readiness, but it seems like it would keep you dry.

  We bought this thinking we'd be camping in nice weather.  Of course when you assume that, it doesn't happen that way.  It rained lightly, which wasn't the end of the world, but the tent material is so thin (on the plus side, it's breathable so you don't feel claustrophobic), that this light shower gradually soaked through the rainfly and the mesh screen.  I really don't approve of the tent itself (without the fly) having 2 of the 4 top panels (the ""roof"") being a mesh screen, but it is what it is.  It has a few more mesh vents on the lower half that are covered by the solid tent material, and the D-style door has an upper-half mesh window that can zip closed, so you don't have to worry about a 2nd set of zippers for the ""screen door"" effect.  Anyway, I feel as if I'm rambling, so I'll just say overall it's a great tent for dry weather, very easy to set up and live out of for a bit.  Enjoy!

I slept the 9ft way and had plenty of room so my head and feet weren't touching the sides of the tent.

  This tent was spacious and perfect for my other two friends and me who went camping. If you're bringing hiking backpacks and want enough space, this is perfect. I'd say 3-4 people fit comfortably. Any more and you'll be pushing it, and you won't have much room for your stuff. Also, don't lose the rain fly. The side windows don't have zipper flaps; they are just screens. If you lose the rain fly, there is nothing to cover the side windows at all.

  It says a 4 person tent but as I had read in someone else's review a 4 person tent means 4 sleeping bags will lay out in the tent and that does NOT include gear so if you want a 4 person tent you need to buy a larger tent than this. Fortunately having been warned and wanting a 2 person tent I bought this one so there would be room for 2 people AND our gear. That worked out very well. I really liked the tent and it was easy to setup and take down. We had to take the rain fly off to get air circulating through it on a hot summer night but once we did it was very comfortable. I bought 3 of these, kept one for myself and another for my teen daughter and her friends to use when we go camping and gave my college age son the other. If you want a 2 person tent thios is a good one but if you want a 4 person tent get a larger tent.

Space inside is great, my six foot husband and I can lie with feet to the door and not have to climb over one or the other to get in and out.  My main concern is the open mesh. Having spent a couple nights recently in Death Valley when the wind was blowing so hard it was leaning our old tents over... I can only imagine how full of sand this tent would have been. There is no way to really close this tent up. Heat is going to go right out and a breeze is going to blow stuff in. Still as a fair weather summer tent and for the price, I am happy so far.

  Got this tent back in may do my friends and I could have a social distanced camp out. We didn’t end up using it until last week though and when I was trying to put it together something didn’t seem right because one of the poles would not slide through. I’ve had a bunch of experience building tents so I was confused why it wasn’t working and I finally realized that the tent came “broken” because the part what the pole has to slide through was sewn down. Now building this tent at 9 pm might have not been the best idea but I should have had to deal with clipping the threads in order to build this tent. Was disappointed.

It was pretty sturdy in the rain and the outside flap allowed us to keep the window open as it helped keep the rain out!When packing it up, it was a challenge. Getting everything folded and get it to fit in the bag it comes in wasn't easy. You have to make sure that you slowly fold it up making sure that you let all the air out as you fold it. This way it compress really nice and will fit so much better. After we got done camping with just tried to throw it all in the bag, didn't work. After a couple of weeks of letting it air out, I took it down and folded it up nice letting the air out as I folded it. I was able to get everything to fit back into bag!

  well i go camping a lot and i figured since it is usually just me that goes i should buy a smaller tent! so i bought this and first night i had it i was impressed! the extra air flap on the back of the tent for ventilation is very nice! it allows the air to come in instead of just the air that is already in it if that makes sense. easy to set up didn't take me more than 3 minutes for the first time once i got it out of the bag.so i am 6'2"" and it is a perfect size tent for my length. have enough room to put all of my gear in the tent with me and a dog that takes up half of the tent by himself hahaedit - -I have survived a really nice storm in this tent now! strong winds and hard rain and this tent still stood up to the challenge. so yes very good tent i would have to say

  Don't know yet if it's weather proof because it did not rain but it's a great size and seems very well made. I can put it up myself in 5 min and it fits back into it's bag when it's time to go home. I used a tall twin air mattress and had lots of room inside for gear. The twin went right in the door after it was blown up. It would hold a double or queen mattress but you might have to blow a larger mattress up while inside the tent.

  While I have not had a chance to use this in heavy rain yet, the rainfly is quite large (so much so i preferred it off the tent so i could see more of the sky thru 'windows' at night) and the floor looks heavy duty and goes up about two inches on side walls. In all other areas, I can say this tent is superb. It assembles quite easily: I did it myself, in around 20 minutes with no practice, in the dusk. It takes down quite easily: Again by myself, it took maybe 5 to dissasemble and stow. The storage bag is nice and well made. The tent stays up fine without stakes. The height at center is quite manageable. It easily slept me, with room alongside for all of my gear, and felt quite roomy. With two people, I would have left most of the gear out of the tent, and it would have been fine. There are a couple handy gear bags hanging from the sides for small items. Plenty of 'windows' for fresh air and views. All in all it seems comparable to much more expensive tents. And the bright green is cheerful and aesthetically pleasing.

  My husband and I purchased this for a camping trip to the coast. I found that this tent was really small given that we only had a queen bed in the tent and that was literally all we could fit (no bags, nothing else literally) I am not sure how 3 people would fit in this tent, it was a tight squeeze with my husband and I. I am not really big on camping to begin with, and found that the lack of privacy through the mesh windows was less than ideal. When the wind blows, the wind flap would raise the size exposing everything and everyone inside the tent. I did find that the quality of the tent overall was good, however there are just some minor things I would change. We actually ended up returning this tent for the Suisse Sport 5 Person tent for our next camping trip. If Coleman made a tent with zip up windows, I would be the first to purchase one.

  I bought this tent to replace one of the same size and model that I have had for almost 20 years. I car camp about 3 to 5 times a year so it has been used plenty in all kinds of weather including rain, snow and heavy wind. The zipper started to go so it was time to buy new one. This tent is not the same quality. I have used it twice and the sleeve where the pole runs through near the top is already splitting. The old tent had nylon ties to hold the fly pole in place. This one has velcro straps. One velcro strap was sewn backwards so I have to twist it to make it adhere. Velcro is a poor choice - dirt and whatever work into the fibers and it loses its ability to grip. When the strap comes loose a slight breeze causes it to make scrapping noises against the tent walls. Also the rain fly on the older tent was bigger/better. I haven't tried yet, but I plan on seeing if the old fly will work on the new tent. Oh, and one more thing - the new tent has more mesh on the sides which means I have to use the fly to have privacy. Before using the fly was a choice, now it's a requirement.

Cons: the tent has a lot of mesh at the top, so it can get chilly at night. However we did use the rain cover, and it did a great job keeping out the rain even in strong winds. But, water did get into the tent along the seams at the bottom of the walls. Other buyers have recommended buying a sealer for the seams, I'd suggest that too if you know you'll encounter rain.

This tent however has done a great job fort the campouts we have been on so far. I always seal the seams and we had a significant rain and not a drop came inside. It is a great size for two campers. Four is pushing it at least if you want your gear inside the tent. The price was great. I would recommend this tent.

  Is really a one man tent.  Very basic and easy set up.  My son fit a low cot in but that and his backpack were all that would fit.  He's 6'2 so he couldn't stretch out much.  We inflated a double sized air mattress into the other it barely fit. But we expected that. We really like the expansion feature on the tent bag.  Great idea.  I wish more tents had this feature.

  Good at what it is, but you must understand what that really is first. Like most tents actually only fits 50% of stated people. Two could sleep in this if they are on the smaller side and don’t mind physically touching the whole time or leaving gear outside. Otherwise it’s only good for one person. It works well enough though. Light and small when packed up, but wouldn’t take it backpacking. Stands tall against wind and easy to set up. Stakes suck though, invest in better ones before your first trip. Haven’t tried it in rain, don’t plan to.

  We got this tent for festival camping. It goes up rather quickly, and is easy enough for one person to set up on their own.The first night of the festival, it stormed. While I am not suggesting anyone sleep in a tent during a thunderstorm, I will say that this tent stayed dry inside and no parts came loose. Other tents at the festival were soaked inside and experienced significant structural shifts.The last night of the festival, we got hit with some pretty bad winds. Still this tent kept its ground and didn't experience much shift. Note, that because of the large windows, there was some breeze felt inside with the cover on, but we still stayed warm in our sleeping bags.Additionally, it breaks down quickly, folds up easily and takes up little space.also note, there's a tiny zipper entry at the bottom corner of the tent, perfect space for an extension cord to hook up power for whatever you might need inside.

I was surprised by how similar it is to our old one. I really like the things they have changed. It really sets up in about 10 minutes!

It gives a hard core to help roll the tent tighter and force the air out.

We were dry inside throughout the whole night, but there seems to be small wholes in the corners. It made a little bit of water leak inside though nothing that a few paper towel couldn't handle. One corner of the tent had a zipper to open a little space for air so that whole was meant to be there but the other corners it was so tiny you could barely see it but either way little water got in.

  Great for two small sized people - 5'1 and 5'6 ft. We had enough room and my boyfriend couldn't stop saying how easy it was to set up. I would MAYBE consider taking it on a short backpacking trip. Perfect for car camping though. I love how you can look up and see the stars if it's not raining - but you also have the option to put the rainfly on if the light bothers you. Love the color too! Matches well with the nature outside.

  I am truly a camping newbie and this tent was very easy to set up. I feared that it may take some time to figure out the setup, but we had it put together in about 5-10 minutes. As others have reviewed, it is a good fit for two. We were comfortable with a queen mattress inside and had space for our bags and supplies.It seemed to hold up well for the two days of use, I expect the next two trips to be the true test of its durability. Overall I am very happy with the purchase.*edit* Well, I just completed my third annual camping trip with this tent and it is still going strong. Last year it rained a good bit and we stayed dry the entire time. This year the weather was much more favorable, but still were as happy with it as ever.

Didn't find the Coleman specific one, but did find a very similar tent.  For us, the video made it possible to set it up within 30 minutes our first attempt.  The second attempt to set this up took only 10 minutes.The screens and doors kept out the mosquitoes and other buggies, Fabric seems durable.  Rain cover worked as advertised.  It can feel a bit muggy with the rain cover, so we leave it off if the weather looks clear.  Looking at the sky thru the mesh screens is now possible.We appreciate the small hanging pockets for easy storage and retrieval of critical items such as flashlights or cell phones.

  As others have stated, this tent is very waterproof.  We bought it to attend a music festival where we knew we would be camping in the rain.  We had a very tall queen sized air mattress, one large rolling suitcase, and one large duffle bag and still had a small amount of room around the bags.  We did push the air mattress up against the wall of the tent to give more room by the door even though we knew this could let water into the tent.  It poured rain for over 12 hours, and rained on and off at moderate to heavy levels for the next two days.  The tent held up and the rain cover prevented any water from getting in on the side where our air mattress touched the side of the tent.  By day 5 there was a small amount of water underneath our air mattress, but it was just a trickle and our bags and everything else stayed dry.  We did put a tarp down underneath the tent while setting it up.  Great tent, would highly recommend!

  We bought this tent for my son's 5th birthday backyard camp-out. Due to the weather, it turned into a living camp-in. After moving a bit of furniture around, we got it settled in front of the TV. It took minutes to put it together, and it had plenty of room for the three boys to stretch out in their sleeping bags and poke their heads out to fall asleep to the new Spiderman movie. The next day, they zoomed in and out and we even initiated a much needed quiet time where they sprawled out again for a bit of rest. It comes in a perfectly sized bag, so when it was time to take it down, we rolled it up and threw some rubber bands on each section to keep it organized. The rain shield part is a fantastic add! It was well insulated, so we unzipped the window section and kept a fan blowing on opened door. We can't wait to try this ""for real"".Thanks, Coleman!

We did opt for a bigger one and were able to put our two camping totes at the foot of the queen size air mattress, and still had plenty of room for two dogs and room to change clothes and walk around the tent. I think do think that I will weather-treat it next time because in the morning when the dew was on the tent, some moisture would come through and leave some items damp. That's an easy fix though.

  Most tents are like this, but you buy one, take it out of the bag for the first time and set it up.  When it's time to break it down, you roll it tight but it still doesn't seem to want to fit in correctly.  You try it again and maybe after the 3rd time, you're able to zip up the bag it came in.  Why haven't companies doubled the size of these bags, or create bags that can easily flex?Outside of the irritation of packing it back up, it earns its 4 stars.  Easy set up (just be careful not to snap the elastic cables running through the poles), spacious enough for two people (but I wouldn't put more than that) with some room for clothes/extra stuff.The one thing that I noticed about the design that other tents might not have:  the tarp on the bottom comes up off the ground a few inches.  That helps keep water out in the inevitable rain storm that seems to follow campers.

  I would’ve liked it more if it had a zipper cover on all sides rather than only two. We used it for camping so not having the option to cover two side windows made us freeze in the night and super hot in the morning. The worse thing was the two sticks (you insert across each other that holds the tent up) one of them was short a foot so our tent was uneven and one corner was stuck in the air. Luckily we brought extra tent stakes so we improvised and used a tent stake as the missing foot. It was already too late to go buy a new tent but it really got me disappointed and I trusted it due to it being a Coleman. What a mistake.

I had one in the mid 80's that I used a lot, bought this one this sprig(2016) and am impressed on how they have improved on this basic dome tent.  The pole sections are just as long but with more individual segments, so they e easier to work with and pack up in a smaller, compact bag.  I like how/ the 'rain fly/cover is lifted above the tent itself so the tent is kept dryer in rain storms. also the older version I had used 3 poles and this new version uses 2.  Very smart.

There is a little draw string at the end of it, but theres not much you can do about closing the flap unless you taped it shut. Also, some materials do feel cheaper than other tents, including the draw strings and on the included ""door mat"" that you can place in front of the tent. I love it, but it now has a tear in it after less than 5 camping trips, so I'm a little disappointed.Otherwise, this is a great tent that will get you going quickly on any camping trip.

We've never had any problems with condensation in the morning and we would definitely buy it again.As for being a four person tent, I generally always feel that tent sizes are over optimistic.

  Fast and easy to set up (even in the dark). Very specious for as many as three adults, but I think calling it a four person tent is a bit of a stretch. It fit our two standard length ""army"" cots with plenty of room left over, which was nice. I strongly recommend upgrading to a better set of stakes: the ones it comes with are weak and difficult to pull out, and since you only need six stakes, you can buy a set of really sturdy ones on Amazon for cheap as free.My biggest complaint is that if you are camping in high humidity, condensation gathers on the ""rain fly"" and then drips through the screened tent windows. If Coleman would add a zip up cover onto all of the windows it would easily solve this problem.

Pick up a can of spray on silicon sealant (about 5 dollars).  Hit the seams twice inside and outside and do a light coat over the rest of the tent.  Should take about 10 minutes.I went through a storm during my first night in it so severe I had to retreat to my vehicle about 15 feet away due to heavy lightning.

  We love this tent; especially for the price! I'm rating it with 4 stars though because a rip appeared at the bottom of the door zipper during our first use; however, Coleman was very easy to deal with and shipped a new tent with no problems (we just had to take a picture of the damaged tent, provide our sales receipt, etc.). We easily fit a queen sized air-mattress and 2 large dog beds in this tent and still had plenty of room left for our backpacks and other items. This tent is great for a warm night and allows for plenty of ventilation (if, like me, you get cold easily you will not want to use this tent in temps of ~45 degrees or cooler or, if you do, you might just need a really warm sleeping bag. I wish the fly were a bit larger/extending outward more, but the current set-up does provide some rain protection. Like any tent that I've had, you do need to be careful/aware when zipping/un-zipping the door; if you're not careful it will grab the material. Even with these few minor gripes; this is a great tent for the price and I would still recommend it to others who are looking for a large tent of decent quality that is well-priced.

  We bought two 4-person tents for camping. Each fit two person easily, with a queen size airbed inside and extra space for other stuff. But probably too tight to fit 4 persons. Anyway, it is an inexpensive, solid tent. We experienced a very heavy storm one night and the tents worked fine.  Great product.

  Purchased the six man and four man tent for our trip. We went on our first ever family camping trip this weekend. I had read all the reviews and was confident in this purchase. By day two of our camping trip it decided to moderately rain. The tent itself stood up fine however after about 3 hours of continual rain the bottom portion of the tent all the way around had moisture coming through as well as some drips down the corner seams. I made sure there was nothing pressing on the walls of the tent and had left a good foot all the way around the base with nothing near the sides. The tent then became EXTREMELY humid due to all of the moisture. I would recommend spending more money and get a better tent.

  I would 100% recommend this tent! I’ve never put a tent together, but it took me 8-10 minutes without instructions. It’s a super high quality tent, not flimsy. The rain guard/cover is also very simple to put together, but I think it’d be even easier to put on with two people. It’s very roomy. It’s also very easy to pack up and put away. It’s a very great deal. I’m so glad I bought it.

  I bought this tent for camping trips for me and my boyfriend. It fits our queen size mattress with a little extra room for shoes, a backpack, or other small items. I think it is a bit small to fit 3 people, but I guess if you all crammed in there with just sleeping bags, it could work. My family had Coleman tents all through my childhood camping trips. I miss the vertical door zippers. The newer dome styles have a round door zipper. It can sometimes be hard to figure out where the zipper ends up, especially fumbling around in the dark with a flashlight. It also has a tendency to get caught up on itself or on a little flap that covers it. Overall these are just little problems that don't effect the overall quality of the tent. I liked the fly and how it was supported with a tent pole. There was a bit of dew/mist in the morning and none of it got inside. For the price, it is definitely a great tent that will get a lot of use out of us!

  This tent is the perfect choice for a boy who wants to have his own tent so he can have some time to himself. If you live in the south, you don't really want a navy colored one, as it's very hot in the summer and even HOTTER in the tent. You can set this thing up in about 10 min. if you've done it a couple of times! Overall, it's an awesome tent. I recommend using the 2 person as a 1 person, though.

  DO NOT BUY THIS TENT. I was under the impression that Coleman equipment was of trustworthy quality. I was also under the impression that Coleman’s customer service supports it customers’ issues with their products, but I guess not. Unless you want to go down a road of frustration, don’t buy this tent.We used this tent for a music festival, and there was a thunder storm one night. Well, even though this was the very first time using the tent, the poles snapped and splintered and the inside of the tent got soaking wet.Upon speaking to Coleman’s customer service, they claimed that since this tent “isn’t supposed to be used during a thunder storm,” I have to buy all of the replacement parts on my own. Better yet, if I want a tent that doesn’t leak when it rains, I have to buy an entire new tent.I repeat, this was my very first time using the tent. It should have held up fine. And since it didn’t, Coleman should replace my faulty tent for me. Clearly, i was sold a bunk tent from the beginning. Regardless of the thunder storm, that tent would now have lasted in any type of weather.Needless to say, I will never buy a Coleman product again for the simple fact that they do not support their customers properly. If I am going to spend a lot of money on equipment, I want to make sure I’m supported if and when it fails.

One night it rained so much the campsite flooded. I had my electronics in the tent with me. Not to worry, no water permeated the bottom. Sides did get wet, but all I cared about was the bottom of my tent not leaking. Price point is amazing for a super basic tent. Also, you can see the stars if you don't have the rainfly on. Huge plus.

  Just bought this tent in a hurry for a trip. The trip turned into a trip from hell because all 3 days had sporadic monsoon rains and the entire campsite turned into a mudpit. By monsoon rains, I mean ""it's raining sideways"" rains. One of the storms dropped 2 inches of rain in a few hours. Since I bought the 3-person tent in a hurry and didn't have time to seal it. For a cheap tent, I was amazed how well it kept the water out with no sealant at all! However, the seam where the tent walls meat the tarp bottom leaks, unfortunately. The entire seam leaks slightly, but the four corners leak significantly. Enough water got into the tent to puddle up in the four corners. However, someone had some tent patch tape and taping the four corners was enough to make the tent usable. I kept dry the entire trip! Now that I sealed the tent, I will be happily using it again and will have confidence knowing I will remain dry.Gripes:- The one seam leaks- The front door zipper snags if you carelessly open or close the door- The rain fly is a little cumbersome to attach by yourself. Not impossible, just slightly annoying to do alone.I would definitely recommend this tent to anyone looking to buy one on a budget. It's a great, roomy tent. Just seal it and it's good to go.

  (Picture does not include rain flap)Great tent for Spring-Fall camping. The tent comfortable fits two full length sleeping mats with room to also store backpacks.I've had the tent for almost a month now and it has weathered heavy rain, light snow, hail, and high winds. The one star deduction is that the sides of the tent do retain moisture (even just from morning dew), causing a risk that anything next to them may become slightly damp. The bottom and top of the tent do not have these issues, inside they felt dry in all weather patterns.The tent is very easy to put up and take down.

I have owned 4 person tents before so I was aware the overrating of capacity by the manufacturers and wasn't surprised, it was what I expected and only intended to use this as a 2 person tent. Fits a queen mattress with room around the sides for bags of clothes and such. Easy to assemble, I set it up by myself in about 10-15 minutes. It took a few hours of pounding rain with strong winds and held firm with no leaks (I applied silicone spray beforehand but no seam sealer) and no water came up through the floor even though some water had puddled under the floor of the tent. This tent is a great purchase as long as you don't expect to fit 4 people in it comfortably. Would purchase this again.

  A good product for the price.  We bought the Coleman tent kit as well but left it behind!  The tent pegs in the kit are better than those that come with the tent, we did end up losing a couple in the ground.  Also, we camped on a very hot weekend, the ground was parched at the festival, the grass or hay was spikey underfoot, so we should have put a tarpaulin down first ( we did not have one as being inexperienced to camping we thought this would be necessary only in rainy conditions), when I walked inside the tent my first step caused a sharp blade of grass or hay to poke through the thin plastic floor of the tent.  We had an old strong picnic blanket in the car so we slid this underneath the tent in situ together and that seemed to protect it from further damage.  It's a great little tent, two of us slept in it, I don't think it would be comfortable for 4 people but like I read in a previous review it is more a 2 man tent with room.

  This is a good 1 to 2 person tent for backyard or warm weather camping.  My daughters have used it a couple of times and have not had any issues with it.  The window is nice and allows for a breeze.  My recommendation would be to use this tent to children or smaller adults.  There are not coverings for the windows, but when the rain fly is on that covers them.Since, writing this review we have also purchased the six person version of this same tent.  It is nice because it is large enough to stand up in.  We can easily fit three twin mattresses in it with room to spare.  The rain fly needs to be staked in so you need some extra room for that when choosing a spot for your tent.  But, it is very easy to set up.

  Picked up this tent to enjoy a late summer campout near a Southern California beach.  It was easy to setup and offers all the basic features common on tents of this type.  It kept the ants and mosquitoes out without issues.  However, the second time we used it, I noticed one of the conduit where the carbon rod feeds through had a rip, from nothing more than stretching it during setup.

  It's a very popular tent because I've seen a lot of people using it and using Coleman's products.  I did not like the fact that somehow ants managed to get in it.  I think they got in through the top.  They didn't get through the screen because they were too big to go through.  Overall, it was useful and I like the outside flap because at night, when it was raining, that flap protected us from the rain.  I also bought superglue because I wanted to seal the stitches, someone recommended that, but I never got to that.  And I brought it because I read that rain seeps in.  As for me, on my camping trip, there was rain and it poured for half an hour and luckily, no water seeped through.

  We used this tent on our first ever camping trip, and I’m happy to report we experienced sun, rain, and strong winds. This definitely held up and stayed dry! There are lots of “windows” for air, and you can zip/unzip the front and back for additional air. We have never set up a tent before, and by following the 6-step instructions (which are conveniently attached to thr bag), we had it up in 10-ish minutes. I would say thay 6 of those 10 minutes were us trying to figure out what to do since it was our first time. Next time I forsee us setting it up in 5 minutes. Highly recommend this tent!

  My first and favorite tent. Super easy to set up, learned in about 10 minutes. I already know I will be using this tent for as long as possible. The windows keep it well ventilated, and you also have the option to zip them closed with a cover as well. The rain shield attachment on top is much appreciated, keeps tent shadier as well. This is a well made tent, the bottom of it has durable material that keeps you out of dirt and potential water. It's surprisingly spacious as well. Was big enough to fit 2 people comfortably, and perhaps 3 if sitting.

  This tent is crazy easy to put up. It took less than 10 minutes to assemble and was big enough to sleep 2 adults, 2 kids, and 2 dogs comfortably. It's reasonably priced and seems durable enough to last a while. I didn't experience any rain during my camping trip, so I can't attest to it's weatherproofing, but the rain cover seems capable of keeping the rain out. It's a good value for the money.

  The first night I used this tent it downpoured all night and the rain guard kept the tent completely dry! (Besides the obvious dampness that is inevitable while camping) I've only used it on one camping trip so far, but we set it up and broke it down pretty quickly which is what I was mainly looking for. Ive only had two people sleeping in at once and it was very spacious so fitting 4 people in there relatively comfortably seems like no problem.

We used the rain cover, we got rain one of the nights and we had no issues with leaks.  We fit our full size air mattress in there. It was sturdy and durable. We had no issues with it.

  The good points about this tent is that it is quick and easy to set up. I really do not see how this can be called a 4 person tent. The only way 4 periople can fit in here is if you like to snuggle!!  (and I am only 5ft 2)  It is great as long as it does not rain.  After putting this tent up and looking at the construction of the floor seems, I knew this tent would leak. You could see light through the stitching of the seams.  We had rain every afternoon while camping in the blue ridge mountains and as sure enough the rain was pooling in all 4 corners. I had an air mattress so I just pile everything on the mattress to stay dry. However, a new tent should not leak like this. If you go camping more than once a year, this tent really is a waste of money. I recommend spending a little more money and get a better quality of tent unless you don't mind getting wet.

  GREAT tent! Easy to set up and very roomy! Only drawback is that there are 4 screen mesh  panels (1 on each side of the tent and 2 that make up the top part) and only 2 of them zipper up. So when the night gets a bit chilly your still getting in air from the roof with the rainfly attached.I use mine in the backyard for sleeping and meditating (to enjoy the outdoors  and not feed the local mosquito population). You can easily sit up in this tent and in hot weather you have GREAT ventilation, that little vent by the floor does wonders.I have had it up now for over a month and it is solid.The price was perfect and for a Coleman you know you are getting high quality.

  This is a great tent for 1 or 2 people.  It's can theoretically hold 3 people, but they better be very good friends and carrying no ""stuff"".  It's not tall enough to stand up in, but it is tall enough that I can put on a pair of long pants while bending a bit.  It is easy to set up, sturdy against medium-strong winds, and water-proof.  I have used it for backpacking, but it's really too heavy for that -- there are much lighter tents available, though they are more expensive (like 10 times) and not as roomy.

  This tent is an absolute steal at this price. The only drawback is that's it's pretty heavy if you wanted to hike with it, though I'm fairly certain no one in their right mind would be lugging around a 10x10 tent in their pack. It's about as easy to set up as every other standard tent out there.It's quite spacious inside -- we were able to very easily fit 4 people and 2 50 lb dogs, including a full-size air mattress that 2 of us slept on. I think 6 people would be possible, though it would be too crowded to really move around. I was also able to nearly stand up completely in the middle of the tent. Oh and another thing about the air mattress -- some smaller tents could not fit the air mattress through the door while fully inflated, but this one had no problem at all.The tent kept up dry through some very light drizzle so I can't comment too much on the waterproof-ness, though it seems that it would hold up in some mild storms.I highly recommend this tent if you are looking to do some ""car camping"" or want to set it up in your backyard.

Took 2 of us about 15 minutes without having pre-read the directions.  Roomy for 2 people, gear and queen size air mattress.  I think it would be tight for 6 people. Well ventilated so we didn't overheat when the sun hit it. Was cool at night. I think it would be cold using in the fall/spring months here in NE. Easily remedied by having warm clothes and sleeping bags. We haven't applied seam sealer yet. We were lucky with no rain but definitely plan on applying per reviews. Can't really beat it for the price.

  It's great! It's a free standing tent so you don't need soft ground to put up this tent. I've taken it on three trips already. Two to Fishlake in Utah and one to Grand Teton up in Wyoming. We dispersed camp and it held up just fine with wind and it stayed put as long as there was something in the tent. I layered up knowing it would be cold, but my friends didn't listen. The vents in the tent didn't help as the cold wind would enter the tent through them. Wish it could be closed, but for the price I can't complain much.

  I bought two of these for my scout troop.  I generally buy Ozark Trail brand because it is generally a little cheaper, but is still pretty good.  However, I pitched out the extra $10 and got this four man tent.  i set it up when it arrived and it was made of much more sturdy and durable material.  You could tell the walls were thicker.  There is an extra vent at the bottom which helps with hot days.  The poles are much thicker than Ozark Trails'.  Another feature I like is the e-port has a zipper on it.  Many of your cheaper tents don't have that.  I've owned many different kinds and brands of tents in my life.  This one is one of the best.

  My husband and I decided to upgrade to a bigger tent this year and went with a 6-Person Tent so that we could both use cots to sleep on and have plenty of standing room. We were happy with the size of the tent once we assembled. Just a heads up, if you order this tent, like the screen on the front door of the tent, there are screens on each side of the tent and the top cover is what blocks the screens so it is not completely open (if that makes sense). It was a little strange at first because we had never seen a tent like that but I guess for circulation it is nice. And it allows you to use propane lanterns inside. If I had known that I may not have ordered it, but overall, we are happy with the tent.

  We bought this for my son to use on Boy Scout campouts and are very happy with our choice.  It is extremely easy to set up and is very sturdy.  We used this in the Davis Mountains in West Texas where the ground was extremely hard and the winds were ferocious!  Several tents collapsed in the wind, but not this one!  For at least two straight hours the wind blew so hard that I felt the tent folding over me, but it never collapsed on us.  And it didn't leak a drop during a few thunderstorms either.  The size provides plenty of room for two scouts and allows for a 3rd boy needs to sleep in there too if needed.  Four people in this tent, even if they are boys, would be extremely tight.

  I've used this tent for three years on sandbars while canoeing on the Wisconsin River. It's held up shockingly well, and proven a perfect tent for sandbar camping. I'm ordering another today.A few weeks ago I was solo (Well, with the GSD) in the tent when a harrowing derecho howled straight down the river ahead of a large storm, sending the canoe spinning across the sandbar and turning the tent into a burrito with the dog and me folded flat in it. It lasted nearly 30 minutes, and I was pretty sure the tent would be destroyed. But after emerging from the mess, I was shocked to discover it had survived with no damage at all. Given how much the upper part of the tent had been flapping (just imagine tying the tent behind a pickup and driving down the road at 80 MPH for a half hour), it was a bit unreal that it survived.I loved this tent before the derecho, and I'm freakishly sold on its value now. Heartily, heartily recommended. Major kudos to Coleman (well, whoever they sub this stuff to) for striking on a design that deserves to stay on the market forever.The attached image shows where the canoe ended up. It started on the other side of the tent -- which in the image isn't fully re-tweaked.

  I finally decided to purchase my own camping gear and stop borrowing from others. As soon as I got it, I set it up in my kitchen. It was incredibly easy--I was able to do it alone and it only took about 10 minutes. It's very roomy- I set up a full size air mattress and there was plenty of room left over, though I'd say it fits two people tops! The carrying case is also very handy and the directions are attached to it so you wont lose them! It seems to be constructed very well and I like all of the venting options. We'll see how well it works for camping on the beach--can't wait to put it test!!Update: 8 years later, and this tent is still going STRONG! After multiple beach, woods, and desert camping trips, this tent has never failed me. I love it and can't recommend it enough! It's like my home away from home.

  Took our new Coleman tent camping this weekend.We bought Coleman because that is what we always buy because it last and it is made well. Coleman has proven over and over to be a great brand for trusted products and a company that backs that product.We like the tent but feel it is best served for two people which is what we needed it for, myself and my wife. Rained last night and it was totally dry inside. You should use the rainfly. If you get a heavy dew it will come in and if it rains you will get wet if you do not use the rainfly.Easy set up in about 10 minutes with two adults.3 stars because if you put 4 people in it there will be little room for clothes etc. Our queen air mattress fit great with space for everything else. There is no way two queen mattress would fit. Maybe two doubles would? We were disappointed that you could not zip up the windows. They are mesh with no flap to zip up. If it is cold you will not want this tent. This is made for warmer weather. A lot of air flowed through. We set it up on a windy day and it kept collapsing on the side that the wind was coming from so I added additional stakes and rope to secure it and it stayed then.All in all it is worth the $70.00 but I should have bought the sturdier instant tent for an additional $60.

  I've used various tents in the past from hard-core backpacking tents to family Goliath's. Many of the tents leaked - some worse than others - but they would let in enough water in just the right places to make a good nights sleep near-on impossible if it happened to rain. I'm not talking torrential downpours either ... just enough to soak the fabric (our LLBean 8-man seems to be an exception - the Eureka 6-man was a disaster!). I'd tried sealants and sprays which helped, but never perfectly (the Eureka had a drip that came from the peak of the tent - how does that happen?!)So it was with a bit of anxiety that I picked up this Coleman. I expected it to leak if it rained so I crossed my fingers that our upcoming camping adventure on the coast of Maine would be dry.Then came hurricane Arthur - who soaked us in over 30 hours of constant heavy gusty rain. It had all the makings for a veritable disaster. I thought we were done for, but as the rain fell I was pleasantly surprised to find that this tent was proof against the water. Condensation from our breathing - yes. Seeping raing - no. It's hard to imagine a worse test for a tent than a hurricane, and this tent survived with grace.Thumbs up for Coleman!  Nice job!

  Really appreciated the extra room in Coleman's 4-person tent, over the weekend.  Last year(2012) we tried their 2-person Hooligan Tent and yes!! it was just too crowded for us.  Also, the Sundome is much lighter and easier to set up and was very waterproof for the few short rain showers that came.  It actually got down to 45 degrees the first night and I was quite cold!  Nothing an extra blanket could not have handled, though.  No problem after first day. Was a great Memorial Day weekend (2013) with our son and family.UPDATE: With a 7x9 durable truck tarp under our amazingly water-proof 'Coleman 4 person Sundome Tent' (Memorial Day 2014), both were put to the ultimate test! We were in a severe flash flood, resulting in a 4"" river running under our tent....amazingly no water in tent! I was walking in my tent for 15 minutes like that (very strange feeling), before going to a small shelter to wait out the storm. Felt sorry for the others. =)

  You may not think this is a great endorsement but I am not a camper.  Even so, this tent is easy to assemble and disassemble.  Every time I put it up it rained and generally it rained hard.  It stayed dry inside.  Even when I did not put the top on quite perfectly.  It has good little added touches like a place to hook my lantern.  For someone just getting into camping this is a good product.The only things that keep this from being a five is that this does not fit four adults comfortably and it is difficult getting it back into the carrying pouch, but it does go back in.  I have only been in there with my two sons and my wife.  So it is just an estimate, but I would think that three adults should be able to fit easily but four would be a tight, uncomfortable squeeze.  There is room for my blow up mattress and one person to sleep on the side and room on the end for storage.  I like it a lot.

Our little Coleman did the job and kept us dry through the night none of the lines broke and all of the pegs stayed in place.  I would totally recommend this tent to anyone who needs something reliable and easy to set up.

It is NOT a cold weather tent.... The sides of the fly do not go to the ground and the Windows inside are too big.  If you are looking to camp in colder situations this is not the tent for you.

Held strong 100% even though it was not staked down as I was on a platform.  Did not leak, kept the wind out and was large enough for the 3 of us and all our gear.

  Great tent for a great price. I got this tent for the kind of camping we do most often, which is car camping. I have great backpacking tents for hiking, the COleman tent feels like a mansion in comparison. The poles are fiberglass (I prefer aluminum usually) but they are thick and substansial. I think there'd be little risk of breakage like thinner fiberglass poles I've used in the past. Setup was easy for the most part, but definately easier with two people. The included stakes are on the flimsy side, but can be easily replaced wit the plastic  or thicker metal kind. All in all, a great tent for the money!

  Just got this tent and set it up in 10 minutes (first time). It should take about 5 minutes the next time, now that we know how to do it.  Thoughtfully constructed.  Rolled it up to fit back into bag and it took up less space than originally packaged, even though there is an option for making the bag bigger.  Room for two twin air beds with two feet in-between.  Very well ventilated, so a great tent for warmer weather.  We are going to the beach, so we'll see how it handles wind, heat, and rain.

In Feb. when it was 28 degrees the tent also did well. It kept the cold wind from entering with the rain guard on. The tent is also very easy to take down and store.

  I've owned this tent for 2 years now and camped with it multiple times.  The biggest pro is that it is absolutely waterproof.  We camped through 24 straight hours of rain followed by another 2 days of off and on rain and the tent did not leak once.  Since leakage reviews are probably the number one thing people are looking for when looking at a tent, I wanted to emphasize that off the top.Other pros:Very roomy - fits a queen size air mattress with plenty of room around the floor for shoes, lanterns and other assorted things two adults would end up having in a tent during a rain storm.Pockets on the inside to hold little things.Easy to assemble - my husband puts it up by himself in about 15 minutes (25 in the dark!)Cons:Only one door. And the door it has likes to flop back inside the tent once it's open more than halfway.Overloading the inside pockets (which is easy to do) will pull the tent wall down enough that rain will blow in under the rain flap.  So if you're camping in the rain, be careful using the inside pockets.All in all if I had to buy another tent I'd probably get this one again, though I'd really love a second door.

  OK so technically 2 people fit in there but barely. It was so tight in there. It says a queen size bed would fit in it, there's no way! We tried to sleep in this tent, it was super cold that night. We ended up sleeping in the car with the heat on. I would recommend it for one person in the summer time!

  I bought this tent while it was on sale. I don't usually write reviews, but I am very impressed on how this tent held up. While camping, two nights there were severe thunderstorms, and I was very nervous how wet the inside would get. The inside was dry the entire time! I heard other campers saying how they would never go camping in a tent with the weather that we had, but I have to disagree. Additionally, this tent is very easy to set up. One person could set it up by themselves easily, and it folds down decently.

  Great tent. For just myself and my two dogs, it was plenty of room and more. A queen air mattress fits perfectly and you can blow it up outside of the tent. It didn't rain, so can't speak to that yet, but I sent the tent up in my backyard a night it rained and it was fine. I hate the bag that it comes in. I cannot get my tent to fold perfectly back in that bag so I'm using a duffle instead.

  The tent was fairly straightforward to assemble, but the stitching on the corner strut pegs was lacking. Two of the four pegs ripped off, requiring duct tape and big rocks just to keep the tent stable enough for camping. Once stable, the tent did it's job, although it was small for my 6'1"" height. It protected me from snow, sleet, and rain. It was on sale when I bought it, so it's what I would expect from a $40 tent.

  This tent is the best!! Was scared to buy a tent online but came in packaged well set the tent up outside and it poured for two days while I had that tent set up, like down poured horribly and not a single drop of water got on the inside. I was so happy since we were going to be camping in rain most likely. Have used this tent a lot and take pretty good care of it and it keeps everything out if you set it up right and close all openings.

  My situation: I was taking my 5-year old daughter car camping for one night for her first time. I wanted something that was simple and that I could put up by myself that wasn't cramped and that would keep us dry if there was a light drizzle. Oh, yeah ... and I wasn't thrilled to spend a couple hundred of bucks for something that could get used ONCE. (I bought this model rather than the similarly equipped 2 person model just for the extra space, even though we're really only 1.5 people.)This thing was EVERYTHING I wanted it to be. Sturdy, spacious. It was great. Even unexpected little extras: pockets inside for stuff, hook for a lantern, zipped entrance for an electrical cord, door mat. My little girl loved being in charge of opening and closing the windows.And on our trip, it rained (of course). Soaking rain that lasted for several hours. The tent did not leak even a LITTLE bit. My daughter slept through the whole thing. I couldn't believe how well made this $60 tent was.If you don't have any special needs (needs to be especially light, needs to be a winter tent, needs a vestibule for a backpack), this is an EXCELLENT all purpose tent. I would tell any of my friends taking their kids camping that they're crazy if they spend a dollar more than the price of this tent.

  I'm very pleased with this little tent. Used it for the first time this weekend, and it worked perfectly for my girlfriend and I. Enough room for us both, along with a couple bags. Simple, and not too bulky when put away in the convenient carrying bag. I was concerned about getting wet (after reading reviews), as there was some rain in the forecast, but forgot to pick up a tarp to put underneath.Wasn't a problem, as the bottom of this tent is heavier duty tarp-like material and the seams were sewn on the inside only to prevent seepage. The sides weren't damp on the inside either, and the rain-fly kept water out while allowing some air in. It was breathable and comfortable in the morning when it started getting warmer.Overall, this is a great tent for the money. Don't really have any complaints. For two people and some supplies, it works great and it comes with a small rectangular mat for you to place your shoes on. Has access for electric cord, and two small hanging built-in storage spaces. We hung a flashlight from the hook at the roof, which gave us enough light to get settled in at night. I am happy with this purchase, and would suggest this tent to anyone looking to comfortably sleep 2 people for a great price.

  Size: I had never been camping before. From what I'd read online, it seemed like a 2 person tent was really more of a 1 person tent, so I went for the 4 person tent. I have to say, that was one of the best decisions I've ever made. A 2 person tent is meant for 2 people to lay exactly inside with no room for movement. If you need to sleep with someone else in a tent, get a 4 person tent.Ease of use: I was astonished how easy the tent was to put up. The other tents on the campsite used a similar design, so I guess tents are just brilliantly designed in general these days, but we put this bad boy up with 2 people in 10 minutes in the dark. The rain cover is double sided, so you can have air flow through the tent, which I found out is very important.It also rained while we were up there, and while other campers were putting down tarps, I of course had not thought to do that. Luckily, this tent kept out all the rain and the water from the ground, though the ground did get colder. No tent is going to help with that though. It's enough that it kept me dry.Great tent. I will use it as long as possible, then likely buy another one exactly like it.

We had no special weather which to test it out in; it was dry and cool but I think it would be good in the rain and wind. . It is the perfect size for two adults (and one dog!) to have a queen size and another air mattress in it with room to spare. We could stand up in it to change, etc. (one of us is 6 ft. tall). The door opens widely  and is easily zipped/unzipped. The back flap is good for ventilation. The rain fly is nice too. The top sides of the tent are mesh but the rain fly fully covers. You could choose to not use the fly too.  We definitely recommend this tent.

  Needed a slightly smaller tent for outings with my husband or my children (but not both, we have a Coleman Red Canyon for whole family excursions). Took the kids up to northeastern PA for a quick run, and this tent performed flawlessly. I'm not a very experienced camper, but I realize that setting up a new tent in 1: the dark, 2: the rain, 3: with tired/hungry kids is surely not the best way to test out new gear. However, that's how it worked out, so I want to let you know this tent is legit! It's easy to set up (only three poles and one of those is a fly. The stakes are a heavier metal (not plastic or aluminium) and it took me and a friend under ten minutes to get it up and with rain fly on. Speaking of rain, I added a footprint tarp and a groundcloth inside the tent, just in case - and we were bone dry through three days/two nights of steady showers, mist, humidity, and puddles. The rain fly guyed out beautifully and kept great air flow. Two gear pockets and a center hook kept our stuff neatly off the ground. We had room for two Alps lightweight pads and a Lightspeed XL - there was a little less than a foot of space down near the door edge where we kept our boots, bags and other stuff. I don't know how long this tent will last, but it was inexpensive enough that if I get a couple years out of it (my children will probably abuse the tent more than myself), I'll consider it money well spent. First trip was flawless, despite not optimal conditions, so I'm a fan.

  Between my dog, my gear, and myself, we barely had any room. I would not recommend this as a two-person tent, however as a one -person tent, it worked ok. Would probably be ok if I didn't have hiking gear, but as it was, it's a bit on the small side. We called during a large storm and the sides got pretty wet inside as well. It's not a bad tent, but can't expect too great for the price for the price I paid.

  For tent camping this was great. It kept the temperature slightly higher than what was outside. However, this is only for summer camping as most of the top is mesh and breathable. So the cool breeze came in at night and it was chilly. Early summer nights in Colorado can still be pretty chilly, especially in the mountains. The quality of the seems, zipper and placement of ties and anchors seemed really good. It was a windy night when we set it up. It was challenging but once we got it up the wind did not collapse the tent and it seemed like it was durable.

  to Coleman and every other tent/sleeping bag company -- Why do you make your bags so small!!! We do overnight and back yard camping and the worst part of every experience is trying to get the tent back into the bag. Our fun trips end in frustration as we sweat to get two people to jam the tent in and try to force the zipper up. This makes no sense! Just make the bags bigger!

  It's easy to set up, and relatively lightweight. I was able to fit two single air mattresses and a couple of small backpacks easily. Three people could probably sleep comfortably in the tent, but four would be awfully tight. We were caught in a rainstorm, and the tent remained dry with the exception of a small seam at the base of the door. This is an easy fix.The biggest problem is the stakes. They are terrible: too thin and too flimsy. It was difficult to stake the tent properly. Without being staked, the tent  collapses in a heavy wind. We were packing up, and the wind made emptying the tent a challenge.The tent is decent, but expect to buy replacement stakes and maybe waterproof the seams.

We used it for a 4 day music festival, so it wasn't exactly the wild outback, but the included rain fly and seams sufficiently withstood several hours of rain and the inside remained bone dry. We had 2 people in sleeping bags with our duffel bags and had plenty of room to spread out. You could fit a third person and small bags but it would be a squeeze.

I got them both for really great prices and couldn't be happier.  Just a sturdy and reliable product!

  This tent was easy enough to put up for first timers. Once it was up, I found it spacious for my cot and 2 sleeping bags. It was quite comfortable and though it rained, only had a little seepage at the bottom corner.I did purchase an extra tarp to lay down before putting it up and felt this was a good investment for a cleaner tent when putting away plus it helped to have an extra water resistant tarp underneath. Overall it worked great and I loved the light breeze that filtered through the windows - which you can adjust.

  I ordered this tent at the last minute before a camping trip after I remembered that my old tent was no more. I personally would not try to fit three people in this tent, but I tend to like to have some space for myself. It was large enough for a queen-sized air mattress and two backpacks. I think it would be a little too cozy to try to fit anything else in here. That being said, the tent is fine. It's easy to set up, and kept the bugs off of us in the woods. If that's all you need a tent for, then this should work just fine.

Tent is super easy to setup and easily fits back into the carrying bag.  We didn't get any rain or significant rain but very pleased for a camping trip in the 60 degree weather.  I will say that the material would weep dew onto your sleeping bag if the bag contacted the wall of the tent.  I am going to purchase a few extra poles and more stable tent stakes, but overall--very pleased with the tent and if it keeps us dry during the next rain storm--an excellent purchase price.

  For the money, this tent is hard to beat. It's easy to set up and has plenty of room for two people, but I think that, while it can accommodate four people, it might feel a little crowded- at least in warm weather. I would highly recommend treating the seams with a seam-sealer product. My daughter and her girlfriend used it on a recent camping trip the first time out, and it rained overnight and the flooring inside the tent was wet. I didn't think this would be a problem with a brand new tent, but apparently, it is. Seam seal it prior to using it (YouTube has videos on how to do this).

  I bought this so my granddaughter and I could camp out in the yard.  Very nice quality and easy to put up.  My only complaint is the pole has snagged the fabric on the loop that holds the pole on top and has torn it somewhat.  It isn't in the top of the tent itself so it doesn't cause it to leak.  This happened the first time I put it up so I was a little disappointed in the design.  Otherwise, we've enjoyed it.  Adequate amount of space for two people.  I also like that you can leave the top piece off and gaze at the stars and still have the mesh to guard against mosquitoes.

I have two issues with it so far.ne, it didn't fit back in the bag (ok, that's expecting a lot I know, tents never go back in their bags right?) but then the zipper on the bag broke after the second use.  Lame!  I already ordered a bigger back so I could fit it and the tent poles and everything in so I'm not going to make a big deal of that.Two, the tent poles don't easily slide through the holders.  They get hung up on the fabric a lot and this last trip I actually noticed a couple of small tears.  Not cool.  I will see how it goes with our next camping trip in a couple of weeks.  If the tears get bigger, I may have to send it back.Other than those two issues, it's a great tent.

I was able to get it up & back down & in the bag by myself within 10 minutes at the camp. We haven't had it out in rain, but here's to hoping we don't have to.

    Rain fly leaks

  I bought this product based on the testing that was done, it showed it as almost leak proof. It was not. Set aside the fact this is tent number two because, the first one was shipped with a knife gash in the original packaging. The rain fly is what failed on this tent, it has a seam near the top of the tent which leaked on both sides that had that seam. On a positive note, our camp site was at the bottom of the tent area where the water run off was diverted to from the other sites and the bottom held up to a two inch deep torrent of water running through the site. I didn't feel the rain was heavy enough to cause the rain fly to leak but at least the bottom kept water out.

Good for car camping since they don’t take up much room in the trunk.  It’s actually a great affordable in between tent if you are a car/backpack camper.

  I bought this for my wife and I's first camping trip. Boy am I glad I bought the four man tent. Once we put our blow up queen mattress in there was just enough room for the two of us to be comfortable. Anyone to try and put four adults in this tent would end up with an uncomfortable trip. The tent performed great, and seemed to be well made. Definitely easier to put together than most other tent's I've used before. We got lot's of compliments on how great it looked from her family, we were quite pleased as well. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this tent to anyone considering purchasing it. One thing though, definitely buy a nicer sturdier set of stakes, the ones it comes with are very small, and I wouldn't feel comfortable with them holding it if the wind were to kick up.

If you're simply looking for something to sleep in and you're under 5'5 feet tall, it might work out great for you. I used my tent to change clothes and store a few bags which made it feel crowded and confined. I'll recommend it for two children, but not adults. 3-star for decent quality and easy set-up.

  This seems like a decent tent. Looks fine for the price. Not easy to put up for one person. I had one like this 30 years ago so I know how to put it up but I think the poles could break if you try as a first time putting it up alone. It is better to put the poles together and through the tubes and on the holding points at the back end. Then, open the entrance flap and have a person step inside the tent and lift it up. The other person can then secure the poles to the tab in the front - it's much easier that way.

  I'm posting this review as a two parter. Part 2 will come sometime in early August for those interested, and I'll try to make the entire review as thorough and specific as possible, as I personally appreciate a good review. I'll also divide into sections.~Set-up: So, first off, I ordered it a few days ago and just got it today. I put it together in the living room the first chance I had and as far as difficulty, it was pretty easy. There are just two main poles that you insert after you've staked your tent corners. Took me about 10-15 minutes(I'm not a tent expert, but I have set up a few ). I attached the included rain fly after I pitched the tent and, again, it was very easy; although the instructions recommend doing this while the tent is still laying flat. Either way, it fits perfectly on top and makes a nice sort of awning over the front and back.~Space: It's 7 by 5 feet, so as a 6 foot tall person, I fit pretty nicely long ways and even more comfortably diagonally. I bought this for a weekend camping/float trip with my girlfriend who is about 5'3"" and I'm confident that we'll both sleep comfortably with some of our stuff. Don't worry about those negative Nancys saying ""I'm tall and there's no way this is 7x5"". I measured it, and it indeed is.~Stuff: It comes with the usual gear: tent, poles, rain fly, stakes, instructions and a bag for everything. Now, the stakes are a little scrawny looking, but I'm sure they'll hold up just fine for our intended light use. I wouldn't mind having some beefier ones, so I may pick up a set before the trip. On the inside, there are two high-hanging mesh pockets. Plenty of windows with a little vent area towards the bottom as well as a sweet, huge, open-mesh top for clear weather nights(don't worry, the rain fly covers this top very nicely). There's also a good zippered electrical cord port on the front left bottom corner if you're at a site with electricity. The bottom of the tent is a nice tarp-like material that actually runs up the sides about 6 inches or so.  Overall, I'm very satisfied with the size and quality of this tent, given the cheap-but-not-too-cheap price. I'm going to get some water-proofer for this baby and I know I'll be juuust fine. Part 2 of this review will come after the trip when I actually use the tent towards the end of July and I'll try to keep it a little more simple by just telling you how the tent treated me. I will say this: if you're on a budget and looking for a decent tent, this one is worth it.

    Quality tent ... roomy without being huge. Nice features.
  
",4.0,Buster Brown,"Reviewed in the United States April 24, 2017","









  
  
    
  Had a hard time picking a tent as I intended to use it primarily on my patio which is roughly 12x12.  My criteria was a quality tent that I could fit at least a twin air mattress in with room to spare, and that I'd be able to stand in without bending over (I'm 5'9"")  I also very much liked the cord access port and the bathtub style bottom, which aren't features of all tents. (though they should be.)I would have preferred a tent where it could be rigged with the rain fly and still allowed you to be able to see out on all four sides. With the rain fly on, it affords a view out the front and back, but not the sides. Without the fly, the entire upper 2/3 of the tent is nothing but mesh.As to waterproofing, I attempted to apply a waterproof coating as soon as I got it, however it was an exercise in frustration as the coating beaded up on the material like water on a freshly waxed car.  Instructions said to dampen material, then spray on to coat, and then wipe with a damp cloth. This simply pushed the waterproofing around and as far as I could tell, none of it stayed on the tent because the factory coating repelled it.  A difficult, messy, tiring job that was a waste of time as far as I can tell.Poles are substantial, and tent is cut and sewn precisely to ensure it's all fairly tight when set up.I set it up by myself and it was a bit tricky, particularly getting the rain fly flopped over the top and secured before it slid or blew off.  Doing this in any sort of breeze by yourself would be very difficult as it acts like a kite and slides very easily against the material of the tent. until you can get some hooks on it to hold the upwind side.D style door is OK. The zipper seems well sewn and though there was one rather tight spot in zipping it up, it's not bad and not a problem. The door does have a little flap over it to deflect rain, which might be handy, A little care to ensure it doesn't get caught in the zipper is needed, but no problem.The guy lines that hold the fly down are essentially what makes the tent stable in any wind. The tent itself is only held down by the four corner stakes, which go through split rings at all four corners.  The fly is also attached to the main cross poles holding up the tent by two hooks on all four sides of the poles, and then held down by attaching an adjustable line to the split ring at the base of all four corners.  The guy lines at the sides of the fly serve both to stabilize the tent and hold the fly out for better cross ventilation.  Ventilation is also aided for warm weather by a small vent that can be staked out near the bottom rear of the tent with the idea that it will draw air in from near the ground and through the tent and out the top and sides.It's plenty roomy for two people I'd say.  I have a twin air mattress and can also fit a small table and have plenty of room left over. It would easily fit two twin mattresses and likely two queens with a bit of room left over.  You can also find a 10x10' or 12x12"" tarp to use as a ground cloth.  I bought a 10x20' tarp and double it over and it fits the footprint well.It has a couple good size pockets that hand off the side walls that could hold some gear.  And it has a single loop at the top of the ""roof"" for hanging things.  Whatever you're wanting to hang has to have a hook on it. I have a lantern that has wire handles and it's impossible to hang it from this loop.  I found a plastic hook that came with a package of socks I think... ha. And with a wire pipe cleaner I bent it around so it would go through the loop and provide a hook to hang the lantern.  It would have been a lot better had they included a hook at this spot for hanging things.It does have little toggles and loops that make it fairly easy to roll up the window covers on the front and rear and then hold them neatly when you want the tent open.The electrical access port is on the front left of the tent when facing it and consists of about a 8 inche diagonal slit with a zipper. You pass your extension cord or whatever through the slit and then zip the opening shut against it. Since the slit is elevated a few inches from the ground this creates a nice drop loop for the cord so no water can follow it into the tent.  By zipping the opening closed against the cord it also leaves very little room for bugs to get through.  It's great to have a heavy duty extension cord and a power strip in the tent. Can use corded lamps, electric heaters, charge your phone, set up a radio or laptop, etc.  I hope to splice into my cable and run an extension out to the tent and have a TV out there too. (really roughing it.)Another little extra that is practical is that they provide a sort of door mat made of the same material as the floor that can be put either inside or outside the door to try to catch dirt or provide a place to take off shoes/boots.I've set up this tent once for three days and the first night there was a steady rain for perhaps 4 hours. Not a drop of water leaked into the tent though there was some slight condensation, but not enough to run or drip.  It seems to shed water very well. The next day, a lot of water droplets remained on the rain fly.  But simply snapping it made them roll off.  Since I was at home, I got out my leaf blower and that got rid of every single drop as they easily blew off all areas of the tent where they hadn't already fallen off due to gravity  (It's a very handy way to dry a tent. If I had a cordless blower (Or even a corded one if there's plug ins) I'd take it along if car camping.)

The fiberglass poles are very light, however, so it remains to be seen whether the tent can withstand a strong storm.

I packed in the tent, food, whiskey/wine and it was pretty close to feeling like a full Army ruck load.I also recommend bringing something specific for hammering the stakes in...I used a rock and ended up bending a couple of them.

  I’m surprised at the seemingly lack of quality control. In my past experiences the Coleman brand has always been a good quality item. So I purchased this believing that was still true. The first thing I saw when I unboxed my tent was that the seam in the carry bag was torn.  As I was going camping the next time day and it was repairable, I didn’t think to much of it.  But when I set up the tent I saw that one of the seams in the tent was also poorly sewn, resulting in a gap in the tent seam. I’m surprised at not one but two flaws in a brand new purchase. I would not purchase this brand again.

However in Yellowstone where we camped it got unexpectedly cold (like 34F, 1 Degree Celsius) and the large ventilation is great for warm summer evenings but in near freezing conditions this tent is absolutely not appropriate. The vents are way too big and you will have a cold flow on you the whole night. We literally almost froze because it was so cold in the tent. No difference between outside and inside temperature. So if the nights are cold where you camp another tent would be a better choice.

  This thing is awesome. It easily fits 2 people and all your bags and shoes etc. 3 people will fit if you guys are comfortable sleeping that close together. The top is open mesh and awesome for star gazing when weather permits. If not, the rain fly covers it all up and gives you privacy when you need it. Use seam sealer or waterproofing just in case, it's just a smart thing to do. Set up is SUPER simple. 2 posts, 4 stakes and you're done in less than 10 minutes. It even comes with a little mat to place outside the door to leave your shoes on. This is a great purchase!

  Great value! Coleman has always been the go-to for my family's tents and quality hasn't suffered over the years at all. We make use of this 4-person tent at least 10-15 times a year. Stitching has held up; zippers haven't broken. The material itself is as tough as you would expect, and I say this as someone who sometimes is too lazy to put it back in the bag. Far too often it has weathered the outside conditions while I've delayed cleaning and storing it. So knowing that it spends at least 1 month a year outside, whether at a campsite or in the yard, it's holding up fantastically.

  I had no experience camping.  I purchased this tent for my son's Boy Scout trip after reading the positive reviews.  It took me longer than expected (about 30 min.) to set it up but that was owing to my inexperience rather than the instructions or the manufacture of the tent components.  I did take other reviewers' advice and sprayed the tent with Kiwi heavy duty water repellent (another excellent product).  I'm glad I did because it rained the whole weekend.  We stayed dry.  I liked the various pockets and air flaps.  This is a well-designed tent, easy to set up, and easy to pack in its bag.

  My husband and I purchased this tent for a weekend Rally. It poured during the event, and though there was about 3/4 cup of water on the floor we stayed relatively dry thanks to our air mattress that kept us off the ground. The issue was with the pole string breaking before we ever got the tent home. Thankfully it only the rain cover and it was AFTER the rain had ended, built we were very disappointed with the quality of the tent.

  Love this tent! We've taken it on a few backpacking trips and my boyfriend doesn't seem to mind hauling it up. It is very tall, it wouldn't even fit in my 45L pack, but his pack is much bigger than mine. It is easy to set up, easy to pack up. When we took the rain fly off, we were able to watch the perseids meteor shower through the screen. The ""front mat"" isn't attached to the tent, but it does come with stakes to stake it into the ground. Not a deal breaker, just an interesting feature.

  Great tent. I used this throughout Yellowstone, Tetons, and along a few passes in the Rockies in mid July. This tent vents well, the rain fly worked flawlessly, and I had no water getting into the tent even through the ground was soaked. The little door mat seemed silly at first, but worked very well and helped keep the interior clean. Setup is easy (read the instructions!). The rain fly is not too hard to setup either, though they could provide better instructions as there are several Velcro straps that need to be secured. The tent stakes they provide are OK for soft soil, but will leave you frustrated on rocky soil. If you plan to camp on hard/rocky terrain, purchase some pointed (nail-like) tent stakes. You need 9.I would not consider this a 4 person tent. It will sleep 2 adults comfortably. The sleeping space is close to a queen size mattress (I used a full size air mattress). With gear/misc stuff this tent would get quite crowded with more than 2.The only gripe I have with this tent is the durability of the top fabric arches. The top most arch has started ripping, I don't know if I simply had a defect in my tent, or if that specific spot is a weak spot (it is the tent fabric that encases the top most pole at the peak of the arch.)

  A ""four man tent"" is quite a stretch, but it went together easily and kept the two of us dry during a long steady overnight rain storm. This was my first camping trip in many years and it was great not to look like a novice while my friend and I put the tent up.  The lip at the doorway keeps the water out, but does make the entrance and exit a bit challenging for this 59 year old. But of course, you are not going in and out of the tent a lot, and I was glad that the water stayed outside because of the lip. This is a great value, and I recommend it to anyone wanting a comfortable two person tent for casual camping!

The only thing is that there are two mesh windows underneath the rain fly that can't be closed off, as well as one on the backside, so the tent wouldn't be as warm as others.

More realistically I might consider this a 3- or even 2-person tent, especially if you want to put any thing in it with you, like your backpacks, stuff sacks, etc.  That said, it's a quality product, and very well made for the price.  It's sturdy, and easy to put up by two people, but I think one person could probably manage it as well.

  I used the Coleman Sundome for the first time during an August camping trip. The tent is made of good quality material and is easy to assemble. It rained the second night of the trip, but the tent remained dry. The tent also accommodated a six foot long air mattress, but you would have to be good friends with your ""tent buddy"" in order to feel comfortable sleeping in what is described as a  ""two person"" tent.  Otherwise this Coleman tent is a good value at a very good price.

  It is nice tent and was able to set it up in the living room to ensure everything checks out like no tear or missing part. I am 5’11 and can stand comfortably in it without kneeing when inside the tent. It is about 11x11 around and maybe 5’11tall in the middle of tent. Would recommend to put tarp under the tent as the floor feels thin enough something under may tear into it. I do feel it is worth money for occasional camping. The fabric on the tent feel similar to north face or Columbia rain/wind jacket.

  I love this tent. It's a perfect two person tent and the set-up is so quick and easy. If you have two people and stuff with you, I'll admit there's not a ton of room. If you're sleeping alone in the tent, you'll have sufficient room for your stuff, but if there are two people, there's not much room for packs. I did just do a trip with a friend and we slept with our packs at our feet, which was fine for us but maybe not for everyone. If you're car camping, though, and can leave your stuff in your car, you'll be plenty comfortable.

We got rained on quite a bit for about the first 24 hours, plus temperatures dipped down to just above freezing at night. This tent kept me and one of my buddies bone dry! I'm not sure I'd want to squeeze four people in there, but it was certainly comfortable with the two of us on a queen air mattress and a third person probably wouldn't have been too uncomfortable. But the big thing was that this tent kept us totally dry with no leaks whatsoever. My buddy even commented that he woke up the first night while the rain was coming down super heavy and he was feeling around the corners checking for leaks and there was nothing. The tent is easy to set up and break down and pack up. I absolutely recommend it! I give it just four stars only because there's no way I'd want to put four people plus gear in there.

  Very pleased with this tent! It is easy to set up as it only has three poles. Two poles going across and one pole for the rain fly. Some important things to note... When rain fly is not on, anyone can see right into the tent as the sides are mesh screens. This allows the tent to breathe very well. The thick plastic flooring of the tent comes up the sides about three inches and then seams off, this prevents water from coming in. The tent is six feet in the center so standing is not a problem at all. Taking the tent down and packing it up is very easy, I did it by myself. Everything fit in the original bag without much effort, just roll it up tight. I would suggest having two people to put it up (not 100% necessary but makes it much easier). Tent is large inside. I was worried about purchasing a four-man tent as they looked a bit small, I'm glad I went with the six-man. Great purchase and I can't wait to use it again.

  We love this tent. Perfect size for two people with some room in between. A few minor drawbacks compared to our previous tent:-A small flap on the door sometimes interferes with the operation of the zipper.-Secondly, the air vents are located rather high and the fresh air does not circulate quite as freely through the tent on warmer nights.-Finally, our previous tent door had the hinge on the bottom instead of the side. The disadvantage with the side hinge is that the person on the opposite side of the tent has to gingerly step over the person on the opening side to get out of the tent at night.I'll still give this 4 stars as it is a very well made product and suits our needs well.

  We bought two of these and really like them.  We camp often and these are quick and easy to set up.  I like this model over some of the similar Coleman tents because I can stand up inside.  It folds up fairly small and lightweight.  It has kept the rain out well, but is not really designed for very cold weather in that the design allows quite a bit of airflow from the outside, coming in from under the fly.  Fine if you have really warm sleeping bags though.  I like that the plastic bottom comes up the side a few inches, because that helps keep the tent dry in the rain as well.

My son needs a tent soon. so I'll probably get him this one (I mean his own, my tent is mine). These are perfect ONE person tents, with just me and my gar it is comfortable and the only thing is that I have a lighter tent when we have hike camps, so this is a bit heavy if you are going on a long trip.I will recommend to friend and will buy one ore for my son.

  It rained decently hard one night of my four night trip - in the very corner it seemed to have either leaked in or there was some condensation build up. Not much but just a little. I also recommend the Coleman camping kit. The stakes are much more reliable and sturdy than the ones given with this tent. They couldn’t hold the pull of the tight rain fly and would pop out.

  This is a simple square tent, but it works as well as you can possibly expect.  Easy to assemble, good looking and it simply ""feels"" well made.  If the forecast calls for rain, the rainfly does it's job perfectly.  When the rainfly is off, the ventilation is as good as you can ask for.  Rain and bugs = out.  Fresh Air = in.  Good Looking = yes.The only complaint is that the storage bag they give you is borderline-undersized and requires that you need to spend a ton of time making everything fit.  I understand that the hardcore camper doesn't want to carry any more materials than absolutely necessary, but let's be honest, this is a tent for the casual camper.  However, bigger bags are not hard to get, so you can always get whichever one fits your need.

  The quality is better than I thought.  I got a chance to test it out recently at a turtle watch.  It happened to rain that night, and the wind and rain were moderate but the tent held firm, I stayed very warm, dry and cozy the entire night, although I found a small amount of moisture in one corner of the tent.I would recommend however using a tarpaulin be layed out before the tent is set up to help reduce the amount of cleaning that you may have to undertaken. Very little sand got on my tent, and most probably that's what helped reduce the amount of water I got inside.  In anycase, set up is easy and SO FAR I don't regret the money spent on it.

  I really have no major complaints about this tent. As always, Coleman delivers a high quality in the construction of the tent itself. I go camping on weekend trips in the woods and music festivals. The places I like to camp often have summer downpours so it is worth it to me to get a tent with a good waterproof design. The ""bathtub"" bottom of this tent and the welded seams provide high quality water protection. I only gave 4/5 stars due to, as others have said, the very weak elastic bands used in the poles. It looks like they could snap or get severed very easily. For this I wouldn't recommend using it as a backpacking tent unless you have backup elastic bands. But the tent itself is solid.

  The title says it all.  This isn't the best tent on the market, but it's well worth the price.  It is a quality tent, made well with good material.  I see no way four people could ever sleep in this tent at the same time.  It has enough room to fit a full size inflatable mattress and my gear, with a little room left over.  I really like the ""ceiling"" height of this tent as opposed to others I've seen.  I am 5' 9"" tall and can nearly stand up straight.Pitching it isn't as easy as some other tents I've used, but it's not too difficult for one person to put together. I live in Alabama and would consider this a 3 season tent.  If you live in a colder climate, you may want to consider another tent for the colder months of the year.There are better tents out there, but not for the money.

Setup takes less than 10 minutes by myself...and less than 5 minutes with a helper.  It folds down super easy and quickly as well.

  Bought this tent for our first dad/daughter camp out with some friends. We set it up at home first to be sure all the pieces were there and no defects. All was good. Out at the campsite, the tent was easy to set up (and fun for a seven year old!). No rain or wind, but lots of humidity / dew and the tent kept us nice and dry. Good amount of room on the inside, good ventilation. Overall, we are very happy with this tent!

  We finally had a chance to sleep in the tent. A Coleman queen-sized air mattress fits perfectly inside with no room to spare. I'm 6'4"", and I fit inside (although my head and feet touch the walls). Touching the inner walls of the tent may be an issue if it rains hard. I haven't tested its rain resistance yet.The tent goes up quick and easy. If you're just camping in the backyard or where it's not windy, you don't even need to use tent pegs. My granddaughter and I slept in it last night and we had plenty of room. For two adults, you may have to leave your other gear on the outside. The tent's ceiling is mesh, so if you leave off the rain cover you can star gaze. Other than the mesh ceiling, there are three large vents on the sides, and two interior pockets for storing glasses, a small flashlight or other small items you might need.

  We camp a few times a year and this tent really hits the mark. It is very simple to set up, though two people make faster work of it than one. We fit an entire queen-sized air mattress in the tent, with room to spare for moving around, for storing our bags, changing, etc. Last summer we even had our 2-month-old in there with us, in a bassinet.We've been through some pretty intense rain storms with this tent, and have *always* stayed dry (both us, and our stuff) -- the bathtub floor makes sure of that, and we've never had any of the seams or windows leak on us.Currently we are on our second one of these. The first one lasted six or seven years, which when considering the price is a great deal. When this current one is ready to go (a zipper and a pole broke on the first one), we will certainly be buying another.

  We used this tent for trip to Joshua tree. This tent helped us to get through the windy season in California. As long as you have a solid foundation on all four side, the flexibility of the tent will relief the wind power to blew off the tent.

We set it up in the back yard to test out the durability and see if there were any leaks since here in Florida we get massive thunderstorms daily. It did not leak at all. It was super easy to set up and super spacious for two of us. We were able to fit in an air mattress and still had room to store our gear in a corner. I couldn't wait to take this camping. We left it up in the yard all week so we could camp again on the weekend, but during one of our daily storms a tree fell and crushed the tent and everything we had it. So it sucks to have wasted 70$, but this is the same tent I will be buying for my camping trip later this year!

I would buy it again if I need a one-person tent to sleep. If you want a tent where you can have a chair or be able to move around due to inclement weather, then this is not your tent.

  Bought this tent as a backpack camping tent...short hikes...and found the tent to fit all my needs.  The tent is small enough to make it easy to transport but big enough that I was able to put all my stuff inside once it was up and leave me enough room to sleep comfortably and move around.  I would have given this 5 stars but I'm a little concerned about the bungy type cord inside the poles, not very much elasticity in the cord so when I was assembling the tent it made things a little difficult as the poles would come apart.  If they should fail I will update this post and my rating.

  Just used this on a camping trip in the mountains where it rained for the majority of the time I was there. It performed perfectly. Not a single drop of water penetrated the tent and I had plenty of room for me and all of my gear plus room to spare. The tent goes up very quickly as it only has the two main poles, plus the rain fly pole. The bath-tub bottom did the job of keeping out the water that was running by my tent and the fly did the job of keeping the rain from getting into the tent as I entered and exited on many occasions. I used this for just me and I could see it being something that is very useful for two people if you are smaller or if one is tall or big like I am, and one person who is smaller; like a child. If you were to try and use this for two grown men, you have no room for any gear or bags, etc. I was very impressed with the performance that I received after only one use. I will be bringing it out again this next weekend and I will update my review should the tent under perform this next time around. I do not expect that to happen though.

  This tent rocks.  I took it to the 75th anniversary of the Sturgis Rally in South Dakota and slept in it for 5 nights.  It was easy to set up (5-10 minutes), roomy for me (6' 270lb man)  with a single air mattress and my gear, and did not leak despite weathering two storms.  In fact, one of the storms was so bad that the tent (without me in it) was only saved from tumbling away (like some others did) by the fact that I had tied one of the rain fly cords to a fence post.  The tent was blown over on it's side (with mattress, sleeping bag, and gear inside!) and was only anchored via a single rain fly cord. Despite this rough treatment, the tent didn't rip, no cords broke, and the poles were twisted but popped right back into shape.  Remember that I had to flip the thing with my air mattress and gear bag now resting on the door side of the tent, which was facing the ground!  Of course some rain got in the top mesh when it was blown over but, as luck would have it, the cord that was attached to the fence post actually pulled the rain fly tightly over the mesh.  After the storm passed I just had to mop up a bit of water with a hand towel, re- anchor it, and I was comfortable for the night.  In the past I have abandoned cheap tents rather than pack and haul them home, but I definitely packed this one and will use it again.  It's a keeper!(note - I hadn't staked out the rain fly cords yet when I took the photo)

  Puts together like a dream (you put some poles in; it pops up). Holds one person with her/his baggage very comfortably. Can't stand up in it and you have to crawl out of it (that'll never become an Olympic sport, I don't think), and you won't be able to use it in bear country. Choose your campsites with care; ask before you go if you can use a tent or if you need a hard sided trailer or safe space. You could also assign it as sleeping quarters to unwanted guests if they begin to stay too long.

  Awesome tent.  Would buy these again and again.Bought eight of these tents on Cyber Monday and got an amazing price on them.  Use them for our scout troop.  Love these tents.  Have been using this brand and model from Coleman for over a decade now working with boy scouts.  Have used these in three different scout troops, and they have always worked well.  They are big enough for two boys and their gear, and we have used them on week long camp outs and they work great.They work great in all seasons, have even had boys stay in these when we were doing winter camping our tents were on top of four feet of snow.Like them so well that I have two of my own that we use as a family when we camp.  They are quick to put up and easy to take down.  One person can set up the three-person tent in about five minutes with practice.I really like the fact that they continue to manufacture the tents.  If something breaks or is lost (this happens with Boy Scouts) you can order replacement parts or purchase the tents again.Also because they are not huge they are quick to take down and fold up.  The large cabin tents can take 12-13 year old 30 or 40 minutes to get folded up.  These can come down in less than 10 minutes.Good construction, and have held up to monthly camping trips for over a year with limited shown wear and tear.

  Holy cow - what a tent!  It's compact, easy to set up and take down and it survived HORRIBLE weather last weekend.  When I say horrible, I mean huge thunderstorms with giant downed tree limbs all over town.  It was bad.  Despite the terrible rain, high winds, etc, and no additional waterproofing on our end before use (I know - dumb, right?), this tent was nice and dry.  We did end up with a tiny pool of water in one corner after all that - it was about the size of a half-dollar coin.  I couldn't believe it.  In addition, I was worried it would blow away/blow down in the middle of the night because we just used the standard tiny stakes that come with the tent - it help up perfectly.  I can't say as much for the other 8 person tent that was camping in the next site over... I probably will invest in better stakes for future adventures and just because I'd always rather be safe than sorry, I will probably go ahead and do a little extra water-proofing even though it didn't seem to need it. For the price, I'd say you'd be hard-pressed to beat this tent - we are happy campers. ;)

Quite impressed, but still had a couple leaks (so 4 stars instead of 5).

  This tent is amazing. It's a pretty standard dome tent design, so you know it's lightweight and easy to set up. In fact, it's so easy, my 5 year old was able to help me get it up.Our first night camping with the tent, it poured rain all night. This tent handled it like a champ. The rain fly kept the rain off the top, and the box-style bottom kept rain from seeping in. We stayed warm and dry all night thanks to this tent.2 Adults will fit comfortably with plenty of room to move around and have your bags and stuff. 3 will fit in no problem, just without much room between sleeping bags. 4 adults and you're kinda squeezed in, without room for bags and whatnot in the tent. It is nice and roomy, and tall enough that you don't feel claustrophobic.I got this tent on sale (seems to go on sale a couple of times a year) and I couldn't be happier. I'd happily have paid full price if I wasn't able to snag the deal.If you're looking for a 4 person dome tent, this is definitely the one to get!

  Went camping in Death Valley National Park for one night, just me and my dog. Since it's dry, didn't have to put the rain cover on, but I was still protected from wind, even though the mesh was exposed. Great tent. Although I like to stretch out, a blow-up queen-size bed fits in there perfectly, so two people can definitely fit. I unroll the deflated bed into the tent, stick the automatic air blower in the socket, and let it do its work. Once it's inflated, it takes up all the room, and I like it just fine.I don't have any problems rolling it up and putting it back in the bag. The stakes work well too, haven't needed to buy extras yet. Just remember to bring a mallet or hammer for the stakes. So far so good.I have a major Pacific coast camping trip coming up so we'll see how it does in rain.

  I like this tent so far. Great for car camping. Easy to set up. I like the roomy interior and the port for bringing electricity into the tent. I have used it in a heavy downpour and it didn't leak. Tough floor. Tent stakes are fairly weak. the rain cover/vestibule area is not very useful for other than peaking out the top window when it is raining. When opening the door, it falls inside the tent, which causes you to think about it because the zipper gets stuck every time due to this unless you pull the door out and fold it outside. Annoying until you get used to it.Overall, I do like this tent and don't regret buying it. Good value.

  This is an excellent little tent. I took it out for two nights in South Florida. Setup was simple and fast. Unfortunately, it rained heavily both nights, which put a damper on my plans. But the tent didn't leak at all. I stayed completely dry both nights. However, I think it's a bit over-rated as a 3-person tent. I could see two people sleeping comfortably, but three would be a squeeze in my opinion.

  I was excited to try this tent out based on the reviews, however, I was somewhat let down. The first time I ever opened the box and put it together, I was at my campsite. Set up was simple enough, however one of the clips for the rain fly was missing. I had to tie it down which was somewhat of a challenge. The stakes provided are pretty average, I would definitely recommend buying better stakes. Another issue is the size. The tent is described as a 7x7ft tent. Before leaving for our trip, we inflated our air mattress to measure it (6 feet x 5 feet) to make sure it fit. We knew it would be a tighter size, but there should have been room on all sides of the mattress. We inflated the mattress inside the tent, and it was pushing out the sides of the tent on 3 sides with roughly 8 inches of extra space on one side.Also like all the other reviews, people talking about water sealing the seams. I figured straight out of the box, for two nights, if it rained we would be fine. Naturally it rained the first night. Unfortunately water came in at the bottom seams. Brand new tent and the seams leaked.I don't plan on returning this tent because it still is a functional tent. The setup is fairly straight forward and if it doesn't rain, it keeps bugs out. I suggest not using an air mattress with this tent because it truly isn't 7x7 feet. Sleeping three people in this tent is a huge stretch. Two people is fine. I would recommend this tent for people planning on using it for maybe one night, without an air mattress. It is a perfect tent for kids wanting to sleep out in the backyard or something like that. I plan on doing more research and finding a better quality tent for our next trip.

  Speaking to the tents durability, I can say you will not be disappointed. I used this at a festival where it downpoured the first night, leaving our campsite with a half a foot of water in some areas and lots of mud. While it was a bit shallower where I was, I was pleasantly surprised that I never had a problem with water getting in the tent like everyone in my group did. And the stakes stayed in the ground even in thick mud and heavy winds.This is a great little tent - though the inside footprint is only a little larger than a twin air mattress, so I'd recommend it for one person, unless you are very comfortable with the second person.

  Went camping this weekend for the first time with this new tent. Best tent I have ever had and I have had a lot. There was severe thunderstorms and torrential downpours for about 6 hours straight. We stayed completely dry the rain tarp works like a charm. The other campers tents were leaking and blowing away while ours remained intact and I slept right through some of the storms.

  comparing to the tent I owned before, this is better quality and it took about the same level of efforts to set up, less than 10 min. Overall pretty happy, especially if it lasts more than 3 uses, only used it once so far. The inside space is tall, and I can fit two queen mattresses in it, with room left for bags and stuffs. There are two pockets hanging off the wall, makes it easy to put my wallet, phone, keys in.

  Pros:CheapEasy to assembleSuper cool extension cord access port. Perfect for when you need to wire in power!I ACTUALLY managed to get it folded and packed back up into the original tent bag!! Amazing!Cons:I'm not sure if it was condensation or a slight leak-through, but near the bottom of the tent on one side got a bit damp overnight.  Nothing serious though, as the rest held up through the nightly rain.  I will place a towel there next time to see.Overall,  entirely pleased for the great price!

  I bought this for backpacking, which makes it a little heavy for my purposes but it gets the job done. I replaced the stakes with aluminum ones to reduce the weight, which helps. The seams are a little flimsy, as putting the support poles through the top tore one half open with very little pressure. It's still usable, but I don't like to see something brand new rip so easily. I haven't had it leak on me, which is nice, and I like how breathable the whole setup is. I've had a tent that kept me so hot in the summer I was literally sleeping in a pool of my own sweat. Haven't had that problem with this one, though.

  This tent is spacious and goes up easy. Unfortunately my very first time putting it up, one of the poles poked easily through the sleeve to raise the tent, creating a hole. I was barely applying pressure when this happened - the fabric simply ripped on the end of the pole during my very first use. I am disappointed by this and would spend more money in the future on a better tent. It feels like the tent poles are too thin/sharp for the fabric; slightly thicker poles would be a better design.

  Took it on an overnight hike on the AT in 2014 with 3 other buddies the first time. The skies opened up before we could put the tent up, luckily we had a tarp and we set up the tent in the pouring rain underneath a 10'x10' tarp in no time. Kept us all dry throughout the night...oh and we slept on a slight slope as well. Also camped out in below 30 weather and withstood the elements as well as any tent (not mountaineering) could. I've car camped in it multiple times, just a tad small for a full grown family (college kids) but does the job. The floor is water resistant as well, so far no leakage. If you plan on long hikes, maybe not the best idea to bring it along; it is about a good 15-20lbs. Overall, well worth the money as a family tent.

  I use this down in south Florida. Easy to put up, comfortable inside. I recommend limiting it to 3 people, you can fit 4 but occupants will be stepping over each other to move in and out. With 3 you can have plenty of space to get in and out without stomping on toes and fingers.

  This is simply the best standard tent ever.  We bought this to replace our 20 year old Sundome tent.  You know it is a good tent when they've been making the same model for that long.  Improvements that I noticed over the old model are: better ventilation, better door shape, better carrying sack, better rainfly, comes with a little shoe mat.  I've had several other brand tents and this is by far the best I've had.  Stands the test of time!

  I had never been camping before. And this tent was one of the first things I bought for my first experience. It was a good camping trip except for one small part. It rained...hard. Whole night. And the tent held up. In spite of the winds, the rains, everything the tent was completely dry inside and was quite comfortable. Just one thing though. This tent fits 2 people comfortably. I supposed 4 could sleep in it..but it would be quite cramped.And one last thing for those who are wondering, the tent has a floor.

  Excellent beginner's tent for light camping in mild weather. Did some beach camping but unfortunately encountered some moderate gusts/wind, which the provided standard steel tent stakes will not hold against. Not the fault of the tent setup, just user failure/ignorance. A dead-man's anchor system for staking down the tent would have been the correct way to set up camp for that trip--next time.

  Very solid tent for the price. Set-up is relatively easy, and plenty of stakes are included. I've taken it out a couple times in rainy PNW weather on already damp ground and the tarp-like bottom (no need to bring a tarp or footprint) and rainfly have kept the inside bone dry. The only concern I have is the longevity of the poles. They're made of plastic and it's a tall tent so you have to flex them quite a bit. But considering Coleman sells replacements for ~$10, and the pricepoint of the tent itself, the tent is absolutely a worthwhile purchase for a frequent car camper.

    If you factor in cost, it's five stars
  
",5.0,Rick R,"Reviewed in the United States February 25, 2013","









  
  
    
  Deciding how many stars to give a product is a tough call, because you need to factor in cost. Are we giving out stars based 'just' on the product itself relative to others regardless of cost? The Hyundai we had I'd rate as 5 stars based on how much we paid for it, but is it as nice as a new mercedes? of course not. For the money, this tent is definitely a five star tent so I'm going with that.  Is it the ""best"" ten out there of course not. Go to some other camping sites though and see how much a similar sized ""high quality"" tent costs. Like others have mentioned this tent sets up easily (rain fly was a bit more annoying but not difficult) and does the job. I haven't had to use it yet in the rain so I can't vouch for how it hold s up in the rain, but I did use it under fairly heavy winds and it held up fine (although the windward side of course was pushed in some due to the wind.)  Like others have mentioned, it's not a ""4 person"" tent  - but neither are the expensive tents what they claim to be either so I'm not going to hold it against the product for claiming to be a 4 person tent. I'm 6'1'' (220lbs) and had plenty of room with all our gear and one other person in the tent. If I was sharing it with my wife, she and another child could fit in there with gear but it would be tight. All that being said, it was actually bigger than expected inside based on what I was imagining when I heard others complain about it not being large enough.I live in Florida so what I liked was that it very large netted windows which allows for a lot of cross breeze (obviously with the rain fly up this would be limited.) The two small pockets hanging inside were a nice touch.NOTE: Although I gave this five stars, I did so based on the cost so I will add that if I were going to purchase a tent that I needed for hardcore camping (for example I need to rely on for a month straight of camping while hiking the Appalachian trail), I'd go with a higher quality built tent. This tent, although it's great for my casual weekend camping needs, does seem like it might rip very easily or break at the seams (but it hasn't yet for me.) If you're a hardcore camper you probably aren't even reading this review anyway and are going straight to REI or something:) Also if it's primary use would be for camping in very cold climates with snow, I'd probably get something more durable as well. For the majority of people though, I think this tent would be perfect, especially if on a budget.

  I haven't been able to use this outside yet, but I set it up in my apartment.  It took about 10 minutes to set up by myself in a tight area, so it would be much easier in a campsite.  It was very easy to take apart and fit back into the bag.  I like that it came with a small tarp that can be used as a doormat.  The tent is quite small and could fit a couple, but they would have to be laying parallel to the door, so whoever is sleeping towards the back will have a difficult time getting out.

    Best Little Tent in Town
  
",5.0,Patricia E,"Reviewed in the United States September 23, 2015","









  
  
    
  My first tent ever and this couldn't have been a better choice, and only $65!  Heck, most sporting goods stores sell rain jackets for more than that.  Took it out of the box and set it up by myself in my yard. So easy. 10minutes to set up the tent and another 6 to add the rain flap. Once I saw how it went, the second time took less than 7 minutes start to finish. First night camping it rained like heck and while it was plenty muddy outside in the morning, my tent and gear (and me) remained perfectly dry. Just remember to use a tarp underneath. Also, just like the directions say, PUSH the poles through the fabric tubes and don't pull - pulling will risk ruining the elastic cord, not to mention that pushing is a ton easier than pulling because that elastic cord stretches! I'm a car camper, so I can't say how it would be to haul around backpacking, but it rolls up pretty compactly and actually does go back inside the little bag it came in. Very impressive. I watched a lot of youtube videos on this product before buying it and the most common comment in them was ""don't know what this one piece is for.""  If you buy this tent (which you absolutely should) and find yourself wondering the same thing, check out the attached picture: it's a welcome mat!  Love love love this little tent.

I have previously camped in tents that the windows were zippered and prefer that over screened windows covered by the rain fly.(2) The guide channels on the top of the tent have torn from sliding the poles through them.

It's not small when stowed and it is heavy. But for short distance or trunk camping, it's a great solution. The tent is super easy to put up - I do it by myself without problem.I put down an 8 x 10 foot (I fold in the edges) and I put another ground cover (5 x 7) inside the tents to keep the tent floor clean and to help protect the floor from wear. With the windows open it gets a good air flow and buttons up nice when the weather turn cold (or wet).As with all tents, put in every tent stake and use every taught line. Pitch the tent tightly so there are no creases or folds in the surfaces and it will survive pretty dramatic weather if it needs to.

  I spent a week in this tent in Yosemite National Park and intend to use it much more.I was able to put all of my gear plus a camp chair and my cot in the tent comfortably.This is especially important for me since I am in my seventies and cannot sleep on the ground anymore,so this tent serves me well along with mi cot and other Coleman products I own.The only thing I had a problem with was the zippers;They would sometimes snag so  you need to zip and unzip very carefully-Of course,this is a common problem with tents and sleeping bags.

The tent assembled tent is very spacious and provides plenty of space for all of gear (myself included), although I plan to use this tent just for myself another person can comfortably fit which attests to the labeling of the product as Two Person. There are some minuscule holes that light shines through and tiny non biting insects can come in through the mesh lined vents. You should definitely use this tent with a pad (even if you have a sleeping bag) Overall its a great tent and I would recommend it.

  I'm only an occasional camper and so this tent has been used twice, in nice summer weather, so I can't speak to how sturdy it is over time or whether the waterproofing works. For all you other occasional campers, though, this is definitely a good tent. Not really sure about it fitting 4 people at night, as the air mattress for me and my boyfriend took up most of the space.Set-up is definitely something to be attempted when you arrive at the campsite, while it's still light out. Again, just a word of warning for the occasional campers. However, the instructions are good and everything fits together properly. Good ventilation and plenty of privacy once the rain fly is on. Lightweight and compact when it's rolled up.

  My husband and I bought this tent recently. We are not avid campers, just enjoy the occasional camping trip. The first time we used it was in the Shennadoah National Park. It is easy to set up, it probably took about 15-20 minutes as first timers. Unfortunately it rained the entire night - and not a drizzle but a good hearty rain. I was amazed at how dry the tent was!! The only place that was damp was pressure points on the ground. For example, if you sat on the floor of the tent you would feel damp. But it didn't make it through the walls at all. Amazing! It is a great tent for a reasonable price.

One of the few Coleman tents that will fold up smaller than its carrying case which was a plus when you're traveling from campsite to campsite.  The setup and takedown were fast and easy and it stayed nice and dry during the one rainstorm we encountered.  Overall, if you're looking for a smaller light tent that can withstand Australia's climate, you can't do much better.

    Nice tent - with some qualifications
  
",4.0,Moonrise,"Reviewed in the United States August 29, 2013","My new tent arrived yesterday. I'm taking it camping for the first time soon. So today, I set it up in my backyard to examine it, practice set up and also to spray it down with a water repellant. It arrived in the usual rectangular coleman zippered package (that I find useless for re-packing) and all parts were included: green/white/gray tent, green/white rain-fly, 2 long fiberglass poles whose pieces are connected by a stretchy thick string (for the tent), 1 medium length fiberglass pole with pieces connected by stretchy thick string (for the rain-fly) and 9 medium grade steel stakes about 7"" long with the classic L shape on top (no plastic on stakes). I haven't set up a tent like this in several years and I tackled this project alone fairly easily in just a few minutes.

First, I hung the rainfly on an outdoor clothesline and lightly sprayed the inside of the rainfly with Kiwi Heavy Duty Water Repellant. While that was drying, I set up the tent. It took me maybe 5 to 7 minutes, alone, to set it up. There was a little wind blowing, so that made it slightly interesting, but I just used common sense and got it up pretty easily. After I'd initially set-up the tent, I returned to the rainfly, flipped it and sprayed the outside material with a good, heavier coat of the Kiwi product, paying special attention to the seams again.

Then I returned to inspect the tent while the rainfly was drying.

The gray material sewn into the bottom of the tent is a very cheap grade tarp material. I doubt it would stand up to heavy abuse but should be fine for my purposes - I'll be sure to put a heavy duty tarp under the tent (called a footprint) to protect it from damage from rocks or such. I'll also use a lightweight floor cover of some kind inside to help prevent any nicks to the tarp material (it really is very thin).

The rest of the tent material is very thin, standard tent material with double stitching on the seams.

On two sides of the tent, the see-thru mesh is expansive covering most of the side and there is no option for covering this mesh (other than attaching the rainfly). The door and the rear window both have zippers to raise tent material over mesh material for privacy and rain protection. Those zippers can let down the tent material to allow air to breathe through the mesh. The door & window have a zipper inside. There are two small mesh ""pocket pouches"" on the inside for storing stuff. These are about 8"" x 8"", roughly I'd guess (didn't measure, but they're fairly small). They're sewn into the mesh sidings and hang on the inside. On the front, left bottom of the tent, where the gray tarp material meets the tent material, there is a small opening/port to run an electrical cord. There is a small loop at the top of the tent to hang a lightweight light. I'm 5'10"" and I couldn't stand up in the tent but the tent's interior height wasn't bad to move around in just the same - not too cramped.

In setting the tent up, one thing I liked was that the poles fed through tent-material loops along the top and then there were also 2 clips on each of all 4 sides (to further secure the tent to the pole). To me, this is the best of both worlds (loops vs clips).

As with most tents, the size rating of ""4 people"" is ambitious. I expect it may sleep 2 adults and 2 kids semi-comfortably, but not 4 adults unless they were put in like sardines in a can with nothing else inside. I'd call this a roomy 2 person tent, so it should suffice for my purposes (and is 'why' I didn't opt to purchase the smaller 2 or 3 person variation).

After I set the tent up, I sprayed the exterior with the Kiwi Heavy Duty Water Repellant, being sure to extra cover all of the seams - especially those seams where the tarp material meets tent material.

I gave the newly applied Kiwi water repellant a few minutes to dry on the tent and then I took the rainfly (that was mostly dry from it's Kiwi water repellant application) and attached it to the top of the tent. This took maybe 4 or 5 minutes, as I tied out the sides to give the rainfly room to ""breathe"" above the tent.

Note on Kiwi Heavy Duty Water Repellant - I'd buy two (2) 12oz spray bottles for this job. It's tough to get good coverage and you have to take your time with multiple light sprays. However, any ""runs"" won't show after it dries (unlike polyurethane). This stuff is smelly and should be applied outdoors on a non-windy day. I preferred the Kiwi over a polyurethane product because it's easier to apply and clean-up after, understanding that polyurethane spray would last longer.

I left the tent to dry in my backyard, with a gentle wind blowing steadily, for several hours. It handled the gentle wind very well and looked the same set-up upon my return.

Taking it down was easier than setting up and took just 3 or 4 minutes. But there was no way I could repack that tent into the Coleman rectangular carrier that it came in - not without significant effort and more time than I want to spend on it. So I'll use a large nylon bag that I have to store it in, along with the poles and stakes.

The tent is fairly lightweight, but I can't imagine one person back-packing this on a long hike. You'd need to split the tent and poles between two hikers, I'd guess.

I'll update again after my tent's first use. There's rain expected on my trip, so we'll see how well it holds up against that.", 4 Person

  It's a good tent. I recommend only having two people in it, maybe three. Doesn't leak and we have used it about 4 times now. Has a hook at the top to hang a lantern. Has one pocket on two sides so you can store extra stuff you have (smartphone, lights, glasses). Vents pretty well and has optional zipper vents on the door as well as the parallel side to the door.Comes with a little mat so when you come out the door your feet don't have to step on the ground.

  Took this tent camping in March up in the mountains. It actually heats up quite easily when the sun comes up, and it protects from winds when necessary. Two people slept in this tent and we had more than enough room. (only important gear inside- one small bag each, backpacks outside) Would definitely recommend.

    Easy to put up
  
",4.0,Hyperbomb64,"Reviewed in the United States November 18, 2014","









  
  
    
  Easy to put up, nice height, but still a little small. I have a queen size air bed and had to shove it in the corner of the tent to fit our stuff in with us. Now that isn't that big of a problem except when it rains. The rain stays out pretty well until you touch the side then it starts to seep inside and pool water at the corners. So with the air bed touching it a fair amount of water got in. Had the rain fly on as well with the guy-wires tight with the tent sitting on a tarp. Other than that great tent just remember to bring a few towels to put in the corners if rain is to be expected.Update 2015:So this is the second year I've used this tent and I feel its important I make this update. SEAL THE SEAMS. This is important step to do when you first get this tent. We went camping in some pretty heavy rain and we could see the water bleeding in through the seams at every corner and on some of the side walls. Seam sealer costs maybe $8 and will do the whole tent with a little left over so just take the time to knock that step out before you take it out. Also it does fit a queen air matress, but not with very much space left for any of your stuff so you might touch the sides while you sleep causing the tent to weep. This is most likely unavoidable unless you forgo the air matress and just sleep on a pad on the ground so you'll only touch the waterproof bottom tub.So to sum it up...1. Buy seam sealer2. Get some waterproofing spray3. Like operation, don't touch the sides4. Enjoy yourself in the great outdoors

  It's the kind of tent that is perfectly fine to sleep in at the end of the day, but not necessarily one you want to hang out in night after night.  It does breathe nice and withstood light rain no problem.Very easy to set up, even though the instructions are less than clear....2 people can have it done in 5-10 minutes.  4 adults?  That would be cramped!  It was me, my wife (we're both shorter than 5'8"") and our 3 year old and that's a little close for comfort with minimal gear like backpacks.A few complaints:-As others have commented, the stakes could be better.-No spare fiberglass rods...they are the kind that collapse into sections and an internal elastic string hold them into a long piece when assembled.  So if one rod breaks, you better find your inner McGeyver real quick.  Never hurts to bring along some duct tape when camping.  I don't know if they even sell replacement/spare rods.Overall, you get a decent tent at a decent price, like all Coleman products (more or less).  I'm satisfied.

  We have used this tent once in hot weather with many mosquitoes.  One got in but I think it sneaked in with us.  After its demise no more bugs..  Without the rain fly you sleep under the stars.  It is light, but not for back packing.  I have had it erected with the rain fly and it looks like it would keep out the rain.  We will not likely use it in the rain, but anticipate using the rain fly when rain might occur.  It is very light and easily erected.  We are two, but bought the 4 person tent because of  the reasonable price.  It sleeps two comfortably with room for our dog and moving around.  I am 6 feet and could still stand up in in most of it.

The ventilation is good, but I did remove the rain fly for more ventilation while it was in the high 90's.The bottom of the tent is tarp material, so you really don't need an additional tarp under the tent (Nice! One less thing to pack) It was an easy setup, probably took 10-15 mins. One person can set it up by themselves without much hassle, although it would be easier with two. The instructions are easy to understand, and the bag is a nice size for packing. Keep in mind that it sleeps 4 people, but that means no room for gear. I expect to use it for many years!

  This is actually a really nice tent. It stayed dry through a pretty intense thunderstorm. The only moisture I encountered was condensation on the inside of the tent from my breath all night. It dries off quickly in the sun, and the privacy is nice inside the tent with the rainfly on.I did take off one star because I think it would be uncomfortable for two “large” people to sleep in. I’m a good 6’2” and I ended up sleeping somewhat diagonally so that I wasn’t touching the sides of the tent. While I see it could definitely ‘fit’ two people, with the gear and stuff I kept in the tent with me, it was only big enough for 1.I would say this is a great weekender tent, maybe for the single person or a close couple. It comes in a carrying bag, which was easy to pack the tent into after the camping trip. The tent itself doesn’t weigh too much, but I wouldn’t want to carry it around all day.Putting it up is very fast, can probably be fully up and ready to go in 2 minutes if you have a helping hand. Take down is just as fast. One feature I really appreciated was that the floor of the tent is made of tarp material and that material goes up and around all sides of the tent by a few inches. So even if you’ve got a lot of water around you, you won’t get wet.The description didn’t mention it, but it comes with 7 metal wire stakes to secure all the tie downs to the ground. There is also a ring which you could hang a light from in the very top of the tent.

  This has been a great purchase and it has held up well.I bought this for short camping trips (e.g. weekend trips).  I use this primarily for car camping.I selected this particular style of tent because I was familiar with the setup process.The tent is well made and very quick to setup.  I can get it up in under ten minutes.  The process is straightforward and intutive.Moreover, the tent has many nice features for the price.  It has pockets for small items and a dangling piece on the ceiling for clipping fans or lights to.  The door is well made and the ventilation is generally good.  I say ""generally"" because I used this in May and didn't have a fan and the tent was stifling for the first part of the night.I will say that I have only used this in good weather and have yet to be in it when it's been raining.  I don't expect that my opinion would change though.  The seams are all sealed and the rain fly attaches well.All in all.  I'm happy with this purchase.  Easy to set up, nice features, holding up well, and light (for car camping).  I would recommend this.

  After doing tons of research and reading reviews and visiting sporting goods stores I finally settled on buying this tent for my birthday camping trip. I'm not one who goes camping regularly so I was worried that set-up might be a bit challenging, but it definitely was not. I was able to get the tent set up in about 10 minutes very easily. The interior was spacious enough for 2 adults with plenty of wiggle room and room for gear. The accessory pockets inside held everything with ease and breakdown was just as easy. The only challenging part was getting the tent rolled small enough to fit in the included carrying bag, but I chock that up to operator error. Overall it was a great tent at a great price and performed exactly as we had hoped and am definitely looking forward to our next camping trip!

  If you're looking for a cheap tent to have backyard sleepovers for the kids this one might work. But if you're looking for a family tent to give you years of camping use you may want to pay a little more for a better brand. We used this tent twice this summer in Yellowstone for 5 days and later for 3 days and the pole sleeves have already torn. The wind was up a bit on the last trip but nit enough to justify the failure. I'd say maybe we got a bad one, but I just returned another Coleman tent that tore at the stake loop on the corner after using one time in the back yard. Guess I'm heading to REI.

  I went camping over a summer weekend and needed a tent on short notice. I bought this one because of the good reviews. It is 7x7 and I was the only one sleeping in it, so it was nice and roomy. I opted for the 3-person instead of the 2-person because it was only a $5 difference.It is really easy to set up. I am not much of an outdoors person, and I had never set up a tent before. I did it by myself with no problems.It rained all night and I didn't notice any leaking through the seams anywhere. I rolled up a tarp underneath too so I wouldn't have problems with puddling. I would say there is a good amount of ventilation, since I wasn't uncomfortably hot during the night.I'm happy with my purchase!

  So after searching and researching a lot about tents I went ahead and bought this tent and boy it fulfilled all my expectations.So there we were at Ohiophyles after a day long white water rafting and it was raining on and off. We set up our tents, one Ozarktrail from walmart and one coleman's (this one). All of a sudden there were severe thunder storms and it started to rain very heavily. The ozarktrail tent was soaking in water and it was all wet inside while the coleman remained absolutely dry even in such heavy rains... we were about to pack up n leave but coleman saved the night for us. though in Ozark's favour i should say that that tent was like 3-4 years old and had been used a lot of times and i think the rod for their rain sheet was missing and so it was sticking to the actual tent while our coleman was brand new. Though it was a  bit cramped up for 5 of us but we managed as none of us was 6 feet.All in all I am now much more confident about camping out in rains with this tent and it easily would fit 4 people.

There's a bottom vent that provides pretty good airflow, and if you're cold the Rain Fly does a pretty good job of keeping the heat in.

  I bought the 4 person, 9x7 ft tent. First tent we have ever owned. We put it up in the front yard to test it out before went camping with it. A queen sized air matress fits in it pretty well with a foot of space on 3 sides.Perfect size for 2 adults that are 200+ lbs each and an 80lb black lab that is a bed-hog. The 4person leaves plenty of extra space to move around while you're sleeping. Love the clip in the center ceiling of the tent, makes it very easy to clip on the base of our battery operated lantern.The first night we used the tent, it was in the 30s, and as long as we had the sundome sides secured to the ground, it keeps the cold air out pretty well. It may have helped out a little that we had a giant dog laying between us though.

  I have an older non-sundome tent version (the sundome version has much more ventilation in the ceiling of the tent) for camping. I purchased this to use for my grandsons when camping with me in the summer. It is very much like my older version and is a VERY good value for summer camping. I wish they had incorporated the more single set up friendly bow connections at the base. These are a bit tricky with a single person. The rain fly set up needs to be staked with the provided flaps or the dew will enter the inside. All in all a VERY good value and I plan to use it over and over.

  I was satisfied that I was getting a quality Coleman product which was well made and sturdy. I believe I got what I paid for, having compared this to a LOT of other tents before buying it. This tent is EASY to set up and take down [practice Once before you take it out to camp!--you won't need to worry about the directions after that, but they are 'sewn onto' the inside of the carry-bag] :) !I had a twin air mattress, and that was at an angle-- if side-to-side, it pushed against the sides of the tent. So, I had plenty of extra room to put food storage, backpack, water, clothes, etc, A queen air mattress would still leave room for basic stuff, where I had some unused space (even!) with a twin.The zip on the front flap door was secure and easy, and I was able to keep the little gnats Out! I hadn't realized there would be mesh Only triangles on either side of the tent, but it was high enough for the rainfly to shelter it. I don't know how it would be with windy-rainy conditions.My friend had a Coleman tent that was approx the same size as mine, a few years old, and I noticed a DEFINITE difference in the material it was made of-- his was a bit heavier gauge and seemed more durable than mine, although mine was fine for camping in a campground. I would want something sturdier and Not see-through if I was going to be in more inclement weather.>> Something I didn't like >> though I liked the white/green color, it was pretty transparent.All in all, it was a good investment for me, since i am not a regular camper.Everything fit perfectly back into the sturdy zip-up bag it came in, and the handles make it easy to carry, also.GREAT for one person and lots of 'stuff', would be fine for two and room for packs, etc.--THREE?

  The first time I used it, it leaked. Not a lot, and it's true that we had fairly high winds (13 mph), but I was disappointed. I'm just back from my camping  trip and haven't had a chance to contact the company. I'll post the results when I've gotten in touch with them.There's no way that 4 people plus gear would be anything but too cramped to stay friends, especially in stormy weather, as all sleeping bags would be up against the sides of the tent. I prefer a modicum of comfort for my aging bones, so I use an inflatable mattress, which took up fully half the tent. This isn't a problem specific to Coleman, though. It's the unrealistic advertising of the entire industry. It would be nice if they listed it as ""4-person if you're really small or you like to sleep like sardines, but if you want to breathe or roll over during the night, plan on no more than 2 people.""It's too short to stand up in, which is a major failing comfort-wise, but again standard in anything less than a full sized family tent. I have one of those, but I was on my own this trip and it's too much for one person to put up, which is why I bought this one.Aside from those complaints, it's a nice enough tent. There's sufficient airflow, and with the windows zipped shut, it was actually quite warm in the cooler nights (low 50s). No rain came in except along the bottom, and I had 2 days of rain.  The pieces go together easily, and I really like the way they designed the sleeves for the main supports. I've used other tents where the joins in the fiberglass pole pieces  kept catching, but these were great. They slipped through very easily, both pushing and pulling.

  I just received the tent a week ago. I chose the Coleman Sundome 6 Person Tent. The first thing I did was to set up. I had help available but wanted to do it myself to see if I could set it up alone. It was an easy setup. It took me about 10 minutes the first time to set it up and about 10 minutes to take it down and put it back in the the bag. Of course it was a nice sunny day in the low 80s in my front yard. However, I think I will be able to  set it up in a campground just as quick or maybe even quicker. My camping is usally at a campground out of a pickup truck. Next summer I am hoping to get my wife to take a trip in the boundry water caonoe area. It will be a camp site without much, if any, portage. I am 5' 11 and I can stand in the middle of the tent which was one reason for the . The 10 x 10 footprint is big and will be perfect for me and my wife plus gear. Maybe a bit over kill in size for us but it is nice to have all that room without much extra weight or bulk. I plan to use seam sealer on the seams between the bottom material and the sides of the tent as other reviewers have suggested. I will update this review after actually camping in it. I plan on bringing some extra bungee pole cord. It looks to me that I could use the poles easily without the pole bungee cord inside of them if needed. However, for a few bucks why not bring the extra cord. I am also going to buy some more substantial stakes but will use the ones supplied with the tent for boundry water canoe camping because of their light weight.

  This tent withstood 2 severe thunderstorms with not a leak. We weren't lucky campers and yes we checked the weather reports...This is one solid little tent for the weekend or novice camper. The mattress that comes with it isn't twin sized it is single which is smaller. This tent will fit two of them and sleep two comfortably. For hot weather camping there was plenty of screening and venting. It was truly my home away from home.

  I bought this tent for my son's 6th birthday as he has expressed serious interest in camping. I wanted to get something a few steps up from the little kid tents, but I didn't want to spend a ton of money. This seems to fit perfectly. After a little backyard camping with this tent I'm very confident that it will easily handle some slightly more serious camping. It has kept us dry and handled some pretty serious winds like a champ. I'm about average height(5' 10"") and I can lay comfortably as well as sit up. I've only camped with my son, but I can say that 2 adults should fit comfortably and you could probably fit a 3rd person in a pinch, though it would be tight. Setting the tent up was very easy. My son and I had it up in about 15 minutes the first time and now we can get it set up in about 5. Bottom line on this tent is that I would absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a reasonably priced tent for light camping.

We set it up, which was surprisingly easy, then we went to sleep. That night there was a thunderstorm. We had the rain-fly on all night. I woke up at about 4 a.m, and around the inside of our tent was an inch of water. I had to use my extra clothes to wipe up all the water. Another time I went camping, I went to bed in this tent, and all night it was a clear sky. No Rain. There was a lot of dew. I looked around the inside of the tent, and there was a decent amount of water in it. I ran my finger along the INSIDE side of the tent, and my finger got soaked.

  For the money, this tent is pretty good. One of the clips for the rain fly was broken, but not worth sending back. I just staked it into the ground.  Just used it for a week of camping where it rained every single night. Remained dry except one night a few drops were on the floor when the rain was especially hard for a few hours.  Setup was quick and easy.  The parts (poles, mainly) don't seem that durable, but no big deal. If this one wears out, I'll buy another... certainly cheap enough and should last me awhile as I don't use a tent that often.

  I surprised my husband with this tent the day we went camping, so he didn't even get a chance to practice setting it up - but he didn't need it, set up is very easy. This tent has plenty of room - we put a single and a queen air bed in it and still had room. The only downside of this tent is that the top cover isn't attached, so a little more light is let in. We are sitll happy with this purchase.

  For the price you cannot go wrong with this beginners tent. The setup is super easy with only three poles (including the one for the rain fly). The bathtub bottom for the floor works nice. Says it will fit a queen size air mattress and it will, but you will not have any room left over FYI. This also makes it inconvenient to pump up the mattress inside the tent because the door is too small to fit the air mattress after it has been inflated. The huge windows let you look out the tent at night. Two pockets is better than one. Only gripe is that the rainfly is a bit shallow and wind can still get up under it and move the tent.

  This tent was used for a weekend away at a motorcycle rally that my husband went to.  Of course hotel rooms were booked as he decided to go last minute so he got a tent site at a nearby campground.  The tent is compact enough in it's case/carry bag to be able to fit on top of the side bag of his Harley.  It was easily removed from it's carry bag, easy to put up and definitely roomy enough for two.  The bathtub like bottom helped to keep the moisture away from his sleeping bag and other personal items.  With the vents on the tent it was a little chilly (it actually went down to 45 degrees at night in Texas) so this needs to be kept in mind when deciding what you are using it for and where.  It was easy to take down and put it back into it's carry case.  Overall a great tent for the price and good quality!

  We did a practice assembly in our living room, which was a good idea since we ended up at the campsite late at night and putting it together by the light of the car's headlights. No problem! (I put the rainfly on upside down.) It did sprinkle the next morning, but we didn't find that we had any tent side seepage.The tent was roomy enough for my 6' 4"" husband, my 2-year-old, our miniature poodle, a bunch of stuff, and me. This is great tent, I think, for most families going car camping. The only issue we had was with the door and door step area (our friends camping with us had a smaller Sundome and had the same issue here): it isn't taut enough to be easily zipped and unzipped for fetching things and the step over area of the tent is a bit high for toddlers that keep going in and out. We had a lot of bruised knees from the little goofballs falling out of the tent onto the site's gravel pad while playing. Not a deal breaker on the tent, just something to be aware of if you have little scoundrels using the tent like a playhouse during your trip.We did purchase the Coleman tent kit with the mallet, extra stakes, and such. I think that was a good investment as well. The stakes in the tent kit were better for holding down the tethers on the rainfly.

  Perfect summer tent. When erected properly, there is fantastic airflow because of the clever vent near the bottom. The floor is made of plastic and forms a basin a few inches up the sides to keep the rain from seeping in. Tent is lightweight and very simple to erect. The zippered pouch is expandable ( because they know we'll never fit it back in like they do at the factory.It even includes a door  mat. The!  fly provides ample shade without impeding airflow.

  Perfect starter tent for warmer weather camping or back packing. Its very easy to set up, and though you start to get a little nervous when you bend the poles to set up the tent and hear a little cracking, there is no breakage. After about 7 uses now, doesn't make any sound and is very flexible. I got a 3 person size for my wife and I, and we have a good foot on each side of us for our packs, and comfortable head room. Its airy and spacey, and keeps cool. Its surprisingly light for a 3 person, and when my wife and I backpack sharing the load is easy and hardly noticeable, but even a two person or one person I wouldn't recommend backpacking with for one person. Great starter for anyone wanting to get into camping. I recommend getting some seam sealer for the bottom of the tent as I saw some reviews it isn't super water proof. I've done this ahead of time and haven't been rained on yet, but recommend doing the same.

  This tent is great for a couple. It fits a queen air mattress with room to spare but I will get a double air mattress in the future just so we have more room to change clothes. Also, It doesn't hold heat in very well (but we also had a very shady campsite when it got below 50 degrees). So being closer together is probably better. We used it on a road trip and continuously had to set up and take down our tent. Everything held up really well. The steaks that come with the tent are metal and easy to put in the ground without a hammer.  we never had to use any back up steaks. It rained a lot in Maine and we were always nice and dry inside the tent. There is a place in the top of the tent to hang something (in our case) an LED light. In Massachusetts, It got really hot outside and inside the tent. But the tent is open enough to let in a nice breeze. This is a great tent to start out with or go on a road trip with. When it is collapsed, the tent is very small and light. Basically, this tent is a good fit for short term and just two people.

We only had 2 people in the tent, and 3 would have been snug, but still enough from for 3 full sized adults.One thing I wish tents came with was an appropriate sized tarp to put underneath of it.

  I must admit that I am a newbie camper. So, I was looking to buy a tent that is not expensive as well as easy to set up. This 2-person tent from Coleman perfectly suits my needs. I am writing this review after two  nights of camping in this tent. The product Arrived on time, in perfect condition, no damages or missing parts. I did try setting up the tent in my living room first before camping so that I'll get accustomed to the set-up instructions. This did help a lot since the instructions given with the tent were not 100% clear during the first try. The instructions on where exactly to insert the poles A and B can be made more clear. That is why I've included pictures of the tent - with and without the rain fly attached. You may get an idea from there. With regards to space, this tent can fit a 2 person sleeping bag (queen bed size). I and my spouse could comfortably sleep here along with 2 backpacks and a camera bag + tripod. Also, the tent has two pouches that can fit phones, wallets and other small things. It is well ventilated too. We camped near the Yosemite valley and the temperature did drop a lot during the night (nearly as low as 35 - 40 degrees Fahrenheit). The tent along with our sleeping bags were good enough to protect us from the cold. The rain fly looks sturdy enough to endure light rains even though I didn't use this tent during rain or snow yet. Will update my review once I do. As from what I've seen, this tent is perfect for camping in California during summer. It took us hardly 8 minutes to set up this tent and maybe 10 minutes to take it down. It came in a pretty compact bag and proper folding ensures that the tent would fit back into the same bag. Very compact and easy to set-up, take down as well as to store! Go for this tent and enjoy camping!!PS. I should probably mention that almost 80% of the tents that we saw in the campgrounds near ours were from Coleman too. This definitely is a great brand!!

  We took this tent with us on a camping trip to Michigan in early August. With probably way too much confidence, we decided NOT to open it. The tent set up fast & easy, but when we started to put up the rainfly, we realized that the pole to keep the rainfly out & away from the tent was missing. We manages to improvise with ropes, tall trees and bungee cords. When we returned from our trip I contacted Amazon. They said I needed to contact Coleman, as they don't handle things like missing poles. I then contacted Coleman and the told me I needed to contact Amazon, as it was their fault that the pole was missing. I argued a bit, then the guy agreed to send a new one out to me. He then tried to get me to pay for the pole! I told him I wouldn't, as it wasn't my fault that it was missing. He relented and sent me one. Not the end however. He sent a replacement pole that needed to be threaded and assembled by us! By this time we were exasperated by the whole experience!I suppose I could return the tent, but really don't want to deal with all the hassle. So, I have  $99 tent and will just have to make due.Note-we sprayed waterproofing and not a drop of rain came in during a hard thunderstorm. It was a bit cold one night , as the temps sunk to about 46 degrees.Not a horrible tent, but don't trust that everything is in the package!

  I setup the tent one time to try it out before going on a week long camp. It was up for a 4 days. We had a bit of a wind storm, but it wasn't terrible. When I went to take down the tent, one of the clips had ripped off and a loop for the peg is already tearing.  When we finally did use the tent, it was freezing. It keeps none of the cold out at all.

    Great summer tent so far, plenty of ventilation
  
",5.0,Honoré de Balzac,"Reviewed in the United States September 2, 2016","









  
  
    
  I've only camped 4 nights in it so far in two different locations, but I am rather pleased with it. I frequently camp in the high desert (NM/AZ/CO) in summer, which means cool nights, but warm temps as soon as the sun comes up. My last tent had really lousy ventilation which meant no sleeping in past sunrise. Though I am only a car camper, I was planning to purchase a more expensive 4-person backpacking tent from one of the bigger names just to save on weight and bulk (and *maybe* get a quality upgrade). I ended up going with the Sundome not because it is less expensive, but because all the tents I was looking at had rainflys that prohibited good ventilation. I was able to sleep in until 9-10am in this as the ventilation is superb.""Unfortunately"" I did not get to experience using it in any rain, so I can't comment on the waterproofing. Some say the little zippered slot at the corner (to run a power cord through) leaks, so that's something I'll have to pay attention to if I expect rain. Since the vast majority of my camping is done in the high desert with only brief showers I'm not overly-concerned. I do occasionally camp in colder, rainier climates and may buy another tent with a full-length rainfly for that (better insulation and will likely keep water out of the tent better). Nonetheless, I am quite happy with it for my purposes.I had no trouble setting it up single-handedly in a few minutes, and it feels well-made. I do like that the floor tarp comes up the sides several inches, rather than meeting a seam right at the ground like my old tent. The zippers operate smoothly and I found it quite roomy for me, my dog, and a little gear. I had plenty of extra floor space to move around which was nice, since I don't like feeling cramped in a tent.As an aside, it says ""Great for backpacking!"" on the label attached to the carry bag. I find that laughable. It is 10 lbs which isn't a *huge* extra weight burden over proper backpacking tents, but it is rather bulky. If your goal is to take a tent backpacking, I would absolutely NOT recommend this one.

  Bought this a while ago, but never had the chance to use it.  Was super excited as it seemed like a great deal with great reviews.  I just went to Shenandoah National Park to camp over Columbus Day weekend.  Tent seemed great and the setup was easy.  Everything was great, but then it rained for two of the nights I was there.  On the first night, water leaked in two of the corners, but it didn't seem terrible, so I figured I could deal with it.  The second night it rained a bit harder, and I work up to the bottom of my sleeping bag wet and my pillow wet, by both of the original leaked corners.  There were clear slow leaks in those two corners and pools of water in the floor of the tent by both.  It just stunk.  I actually kept the tent poles and threw out the tent and the last night I slept in my friend's tent.  I understand it was on sale, but for a Coleman and first time use, I was extremely disappointed.  Maybe I just happened to get a faulty tent as most reviews have been good, but it was a bad experience and I expected more from Coleman.

  I just got back from camping on an island in a lake. This was my first time using this tent. It was wonderful. It thunderstormed at least once a day and this tent kept the rain out just fine. It also held up to some intense wind. I love how much room this tent gives you for standing and also for storing supplies. The only downside I could find to this tent was that since two sides have large screens for sides so the rain cover needs to be used for any rain and also for privacy. The ventilation was great! I am very satisfied with this purchase.

  I used this tent, brand-new, camping in the summertime with a light but steady rain. The tent leaked water inside through the seams in three of the four corners! I woke up in the morning with pools of water inside the tent’s corners, and my sleeping mat got soaking wet. Poor quality.

  I'm excited to use this tent in Hawaii! I assembled it easily in my living room and checked with a friend on the island who said the rain fly should be adequate. Great little tent, perfect size for one person to sleep in with a suitcase and changing space. My 4-man Coleman tent has lasted for years so I'm expecting the same quality for the price range.

    Great Starter Tent
  
",5.0,Arose,"Reviewed in the United States September 20, 2016","









  
  
    
  I grew up camping so I have some experience with outdoor gear. Is this the best tent ever? Of course not, look at the price. But it is a great starter tent for summer weather. I got drizzled on for a while and didn't experience condensation getting all over my stuff inside.  The material is passable, the floor of the tent has a sufficient rise to guard against leaking in, and I didn't bust any zippers. Side note on the zippers though; they're about as sturdy as you'd expect them to be for the price so just be gentle with them and be aware that you're not catching fabric between its teeth as you go. I would say it is possible to bust a zipper but if you're careful, you'll likely get mileage out of this tent. As far as size, I bought one of those blue standard queen blow up air mattresses and it was a sure struggle getting it through the door but I managed to do so by sort of squeezing it in half in which case by the time it was in it was upside down and nothing could be done about that. A queen mattress length is too long to fit from front door to back window but it did tightly fit sideways and I had enough room at the front door for my medium size suitcase and all my other camp junk. The rain guard is what it is, serves its purpose but I wouldn't suggest counting on the material to hold up in a rainy season when you're shoveling trenches around your tent to guide rushing water away. Make no mistake this is a starter tent for summertime use, not for professional woodsmen that get snobby about their materials (if you're snobby about zippers maybe opt elsewhere). If you're like me and shopping all at once for everything you'd need, it can get pricey quick so maybe work with this for now and upgrade your starter items over the years. It has a hook to hang your light (stick with something fairly light in weight for that), a screened zip window in the back and a zipper door that can also serve as a window when shut. Works for me. But I'm not a quality snob. I give it 5 stars not for being the best tent ever but for serving it's purpose & offering what you'd expect at a low price.

  My husband and I bought this tent for our churches family camp for a weekend at Casa De Fruita in California near Hollister. The tent served us well, and one of the nights it started raining, but we didn't get wet at all. Its water proof and we also found ourselves very warm as well. Its also more roomy then the tent we previously had. You can fit two sleeping bags inside, no problem. Along with your bags too. It was also pretty easy to set up as well. No issues! The zipper works great as well. I highly recommend this tent for at least two people. More than three will be pushing it, unless you intent to set 3 or 4 small children up in the tent, then I think you should be good. Just my opinion though :)

The packaging department for the original item messed up big time too though. I want an RMA and a freaking return ASAP!I am disappointed because I paid for a new item. When I got this item, it was CLEARLY used. It was full of a dustpans worth of previous camping fod and dirt. Someone clearly used this, returned it, and then it was not vetted to ensure it was ready to be labeled new or used. I mean... the RMA process didnt even clean it out to make it look ""new"". If you're going to charge that price... clearly mark it as used. When I pay for a NEW product, I expect a NEW product.

  Recently used this tent while camping on the West Coast. This tent held up very well to some major/heavy rain, meaning torrential down-pours! Everything stayed very dry inside the tent, no leaks to speak of. Very easy to set up; it took less than ten minutes with two people. Construction of the tent is excellent quality. It does not come with a footprint, like some higher-end tents, but for the price, this tent cannot be beat. After looking at some tents in the $150-$300 range, we were very happy we bought the Coleman. Great quality at an affordable rate.

  Very roomie. Worked great till first storm came in. One of the poles broke. Wind wasn't that bad other tents stayed up fine. Mine was only one that had issues with the pole breaking. Ended up duct taping an extra stake to the broken pole to keep the tent up for the night and cut the camp trip early.

  Excellent tent for small money!  For those of U who like me, don't use electrical cords when camping...be sure U close ALL the Velcro type electric cord openings. I missed 1 + had a tiny puddle during an overnight NH White Mtns. shower. Nothing serious; luckily there wasn't any gear in that spot. For campers who would need electricity inside the tent I would suggest U use it cautiously if it rains heavily as the tent does take on water with the cord slits even slightly open.

    Great Tent for Car Camping
  
",5.0,Zachary J. Shedlock,"Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2014","









  
  
    
  An overall good reliable tent for the price.  It's ideal for car camping, but far too large to be a backpacking tent.  Very spacious with good amenities for the price.  I used it this past weekend for 4 days in VT and it kept me dry throughout a couple sporadic wind and rain storms, so definitely got use out of the rain/weather protection.  My only very minor complaint is the zipper tended to get stuck sometimes at the bottom of the door when closing it.  This is just my pet peeve and should not prevent someone from buying this tent.  Highly recommend this product!

  The ten itself is nice and the quality seems pretty good.  I was hoping my son and I could fit in it comfortably, but I used it on a camping trip where I slept in it alone and at 6'4"", I had to sleep at an angle.  Still my head was touching one end and my feet the other.  Not a chance I could share that tent with anyone else.

  Perfect for two people. Maybe three, but tents never fit the number of people it says it can comfortably. Love how it is open so you can see the stars if the weather is good. So easy to set up. We always buy better stakes then the ones that come with tents. Compacts into a small space. Perfect.

    Comfortable front-country camping for two
  
",4.0,John Strange,"Reviewed in the United States May 8, 2017","









  
  
    
  As usual, the person-rating of this tent pertains to the maximum possible adult occupancy, without reference to any gear you might have. I use this tent for front-country camping, where is is very roomy and comfortable for two people with sleeping cots and all our gear. Here are the highlights after at least 20-nights in this tent.Assembly is quick and simple. On a windy day the fly is a little challenging but nothing that can't be solved with an extra pair of hands.Last year I was camping in the Adirondacks and had two days of persistent heavy rain. The inside stayed perfectly dry. Full marks for water-proofing.Be aware this really is a three season, warm climate tent. There are large insect-screen windows on all four sides, and a ventilation opening down low on the back wall, great during the summer. However, only the windows on the door and back wall can zippered shut (necessary for privacy since the fly doesn't go over these). There is no way to seal the other three openings. I have spent three nights in this tent where temperatures were around 40 degrees Fahrenheit (five degrees Celcius) and even with an appropriately rated sleeping bag it was hard to stay comfortable because of the cold wind blowing through the tent.The tub-floor is sturdy and holding up well, in fact the whole tent is showing no signs of wear. Recommended for warm climate camping trips where weight isn't an issue.
