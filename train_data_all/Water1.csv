    Been drinking sparkling water every day, straight, for over 5 years now.
  
",1.0,PhunGuy,"Reviewed in the United States September 14, 2018","









  
  
    
  Been drinking sparkling water every day for the last 5 years. We traditionally purchase it at the local wholesale store (the one that starts with a “C” & kind of rhymes with ‘yo-yo’) but gave this one a try back when it went on sale a few weeks back for like $14/case & bought 3X of them. Aside from upsetting our UPS delivery man due to him having to carry those heavy things & also having ordered 6X cases of that “Bubly” flavored sparkling water in cans which were also on sale, we’ve decided to not go this route again largely because they were flat!  ALL OF THEM!  Just now opened & trashed one of the last 3 bottles in the last case & I just can’t figure it out. Even the ones that had some carbonation right after opening seemed to go flat within the first 5 minutes. MASSIVELY disappointing & also bizarre as we switch between Pellegrino & Perrier every week or so.

    UPDATED REVIEW
  
",5.0,kb in Washington,"Reviewed in the United States February 1, 2018","









  
  
    
  We were buying the glass bottle version at the big-box store, but it is so heavy to tote home!  I convinced my husband to try these, and see how great it is to have the case delivered to our door by Amazon!  Yeah, we're both happy, and we don't have to lug the case of glass bottles home!  Win-win!UPDATE:  According to the Customer Q&A section the manufacturer says this water is 5.3 to 5.6 or so.  It says they  add carbon dioxide for the carbonation, which becomes carbonic acid when dissolved in water.  If  5.6 is correct, that makes this very acidic, which is not healthy at all--especially if you are eating acidic foods like we all do, like meats for instance.  Major bummer.  My husband loves this water and drinks it all day long.  I'm going to try to encourage him to add an alkalizer to the water, something like ""Ph10Max"", or ""AlkazOne"", both of which are available on Amazon, and are unflavored drops you can use to alkalize the water.  I'm not sure how well that addition will go with him or the water (don't even know yet if it will make the water go flat), but I'm going to see if he will try it.

    My favorite mineral water.  Tastes great and is good for you
  
",5.0,Rani Lueder,"Reviewed in the United States February 5, 2018","









  
  
    
  Oh my gawd, this is my very favorite of all the mineral waters.  So much better than Perrier.  I read somewhere in a newspaper health article that Pellegrino undergoes huge pressure for centuries, moving very slowly from one cavern to another.  I may describe it poorly, but it is really good for you (I take it to help my bones among other things) and it tastes great.I haven't spent a great deal of time trying to understand the issues, but there's pretty strong research that it's better for your health to eat alkaline foods  - or rather foods that are alkalizing.  The calcium and magnesium make this an alkaline food.

When I received the box (24x16.9) and saw the expiration date of late 2020, I was happy but as soon as I tried the 1st then the 2nd that turned to disappointment., the whole case is bad.it tastes almost like you had the bottles opened in the sun for a long period then resealed, no gas no carbonation no taste only a weird tasting drink.Avoid at all costs,even for free do not drink this liquid.

    Water comes in Plastic Bottles and is totally Flat
  
",1.0,Lady C,"Reviewed in the United States March 30, 2019","









  
  
    
  We usually buy this water from the local store.  It comes in glass bottles and it is excellent, taste and gas.  The Amazon water arrived OK, but when I opened the bottle, about 2 or 3 bubbles raised to the surface and that was it.  Since I do not know what caused the gas to dissipate from the bottle, I do not want to drink it.  I do not recommend buying mineral water in plastic bottles anyway.

    My order from February 2020 may have made me sick
  
",1.0,Peter,"Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I tried this product for the first time in Feb. 2020. I only had a few bottles over the course of about a week. I wasn't very impressed as it tasted flat and bitter. One night, I had a bit before sleep and I woke up at 3AM with nausea and a racing heart. I thought I was having a heart attack or panic attack. I ended up sick on and off for months (and am still getting over it as of October 2020). It's slow progress but I am feeling better.Now, it is possible I have been dealing with the ""longhaul"" form of coronavirus and that it was not the water, but personally, I'm not taking my chances again and I would advise prospective buyers to be very cautious. As a first time drinker of mineral water, I was not familiar with the product. If you are familiar with it, you might be able to recognize any problems with it.There are other 1-star reviewers who mentioned issues with their water. Look for the reviews from circa June-July 2020. One such reviewer mentioned having called the company and them saying Amazon possibly stored it incorrectly and caused plastic to leech into the water. I wonder if I ingested plastic that evening? It may have damaged my organs and for months my body had to repair itself (still getting over it).When I examined my unopened bottles a few months later I noticed a pool of white looking sludge sitting on the bottom. I wasn't sure if that was the ""minerals"" or what. Could that have been the plastic? Like, does the CO2 cause the plastic to erode/melt over time or something? Also, the bottles had a date of 2016 on them. Wish I noticed that before I drank it several months back.Am I being unfair to only suspect this water? I don't think it is unfair to give a 1-star review for suspecting this water. Because, even if I didn't get sick from this water, I still didn't like it. Flat and bitter. Also, the date on the bottle said 2016, so if they were expired that certainly doesn't help. My theory is that I probably did have corona in late Feb/early March, but it was this water that stressed out my body to cause corona to become a ""longhaul"" form of inflammation that lasted for months and months.

  There was something wrong with this water. I have been drinking Pellegrino water for 50 years. My ancestors are from the part of Italy that the water comes from. There was something wrong with this water. It gave me a bad stomach ache and It had an alkaline taste as well as a certain sharpness. Perhaps foolishly, I tried different bottles in the package over a two-week period, and each time I drank some of the water, the stomachache returned. When I bought Pellegrino again at the supermarket, I did not have this stomach ache. I called Pellegrino, and they told me that the problem was due to the Amazon  Pellegrino water being stored in correctly. They said that improper storage causes the plastic to leach into the water and create the conditions I described. Beware....

    For those who like San Pellegrino
  
",5.0,JM from SC,"Reviewed in the United States January 27, 2018","









  
  
    
  Some people argue that water has no taste. Well, those people's taste buds are shot. Water tastes differently, according to the mineral content of different water brands.San Pellegrino is one of my favorites (but not THE favorite). I have developed a preference of San Pellegrino over Perrier (which I used to be a fan of at one time.) These two are the most known brands sparkling water in the US. I've tried store brands in the US, but just save your money and drink filtered tap water instead.For those who like San Pellegrino, try Gerolsteiner from Germany, or Apollinaris. My favorite is Rosport Blue - sparkling water from the great small country of Luxembourg. The carbonation is not as strong (smaller bubbles... if that makes sense). Unfortunately, those are harder to find (Gerolsteiner, Apollinaris) if not impossible (Rosport).

    Almost no sparkle
  
",2.0,El Light,"Reviewed in the United States March 30, 2019","









  
  
    
  As others have written, I too have received almost ""flat"" water. I know plastic bottles will not hold on to the carbonation as long as glass bottles will - whether it's a soft drink or water.  Maybe those of us whose water doesn't sparkle very much got bottles that had been sitting in storage too long. I won't be buying these again - the price is not a bargain if the water is almost flat when received. I'll go back to the glass bottles from the grocery store - when I buy glass, I can open it, drink a small amount if that's all I want, seal the bottle back up, and it's still sparkling for a few days.

  San Pellegrino for a while now has been a really liked brand of Seltzer Water for people, companies, and restaurants alike. This is a brand that you frequently see being served to you if you go to fancy places and ask for bottled Seltzer Water. The taste is well appreciated by many BUTT here is where I disagree. I really think that there are other brands out there that would be much more preferable to San Pellegrino. I think that the taste of San Pellegrino is a bit off and taste too filled with minerals or something. I still have a few bottles left of the case I bought just sitting here in the home.

It is a nice substitute when you either want to come off of drinking alcoholic beverages or if you don't drink and want to fit in with your friends or colleagues, you can pour some of this nice sparkling water in a wine glass. We even like it as something to just sit down with and relax while sipping it. It can even be helpful for settling an upset stomach. San Pellegrino Sparkling Natural Mineral Water has been around since 1899 and is a well established product within nice resorts so it also makes for a classy presentation to guests at home.

  The water tastes fine, with adequate sparkle, and I like these small, lightweight plastic bottles for carrying around or lifting to drink from at night.  They are also easier to position in a crowded fridge.I have ordered this water many times in the last couple years. My main criticism is that the tops are getting increasingly difficult to open.  I typically have to get a tool ( a rubber dish glove, or something that will give me better grip and traction ) to get the bottles to open, and then I still strain and grunt, Even a big strong man has trouble. It takes away some of the pleasure of the refreshment when it is a battle to get into it.  I have not had this problem with other sparkling waters. I am now negatively conditioned to associate opening a bottle with hand pain and struggle,

  This water is what healthy people should be drinking. Supplements can be dissolved in this water thanks to carbonation  which makes minerals available to cells. Water analysis is available from the manufacturer online, and isn't polluted with fluoride like most bottled waters. We do wish it was still available in glass bottles, but the plastic is BPA free. Anyone working in a water treatment plant knows how toxic ""purified"" water can be, and manufactures don't have to supply information on where their water is bottled. No toilet paper fragments, discarded medications, chemicals or toxic heavy metals in this water. Very pleased with this product, and glad Italy has good free flowing water to share. That won't be the case forever.

I love the larger bottle and it stays bubbly after I reclose it. This is the second or third time that I've ordered it and the first time that I had any problem with the packaging.

  This is my favorite water. Locally prices are way over the national average for food so Amazon has been great and convenient. I forgot a friend of mine said he couldn't tell the difference in taste if he drank out glass or crystal glasses. I told him to taste any water in the two. Yes, he could tell the difference which he couldn't with a $120 bottle of nice stuff.The idea of putting water in plastic bottles must have been to reduce spbreakage in shipping. Since it gets from Italy to my local supermarket in glass, and they can pack lots of plastic in those boxes, given the difference in taste and people noticing the screw tops were letting it go flat, PLEASE USE THE PLASTIC AROUND GLASS BOTTLES. Or lots of paper. Then in winter you can ship it in plastic to Northern states where it would crack open. I have a bad back  and can't get groceries out of the cart.

  In my mind San Pelligrino is the “just right” option out of what I consider the “Big 3” of sparkling water; San Pelligrino, Topo Chico, and Perrier. Perrier isn’t effervescent enough and Topo Chico seems to be almost like minor assault to me. San Pelligrino on the other hand is just the right effervescence for me. They come in a variety of flavors but artificially acquired fruit flavors always seems to be just a little bit disconcerting to me. I prefer the plain one and would recommend to anyone who is underwhelmed by Perrier or overwhelmed by Topo Chico.

",1.0,The Tragic Poet,"Reviewed in the United States July 29, 2018","









  
  
    
  I thought that all the reviews about these being slightly on the flat side were just people ordering from non Amazon fulfilled sources. I was wrong: I ordered 2 boxes of these things, and they were much flatter than you'd buy in the store. How much more flat?I'll explain it this way: you know how you usually have to be careful opening Pellegrino (and other carbonated beverages) because they can overflow? No worries on these: you can give them a quick open. They'll fizz a little, but won't even come remotely near the top. This has been the case on most of my bottles thus far.Honestly, I'd say if you must order through Amazon, and you really mind the potential flatness... get  La Croix. It comes in a can, so it's going to keep it's carbonation, it has the same zero sugar zero anything properties of pellegrino, and hey have nice essence versions.

  Although I normally like sparkling water with a little more fizz to it, I love how fresh and clean San Pellegrino tastes.

Previously, we drank seltzer water, but when our usual brand became hard to find, we switched to this.

  After living in Europe for 3 years where mineral water is more available than sunlight, this is the closest product I've been able to find within a somewhat decent price point. Perrier gets a higher rating because people don't even enjoy the mineral taste. This won't be as bubbly as Perrier either, but if you're looking to actually Drink your water in relatively short order like me, this isn't a problem. Not to mention, this has WAY more minerals than Perrier, which does a body good.

  I get those delivered monthly (thanks to Amazon and the UPS guy who climbs up the stairs to my second story apartment to deliver the heavy box). I use them everywhere. I take them to my personal training sessions - my medically trained personal trainer said that I do not need electrolyte drinks unless there is extreme exertion, and in one hour of training, there is not such exertion, so mineral water is just fine (and it tastes better). I take it to the Korean spa I go to because I need to replenish the fluids lost during the time in hot sauna, steam room, etc., and these bottles are plastic, so they are allowed, unlike glass bottles. I always have a stash in the car, both to sip when I am driving and to have on me if I stop by for cheap eat-in food such as Chipotle - this way I do not have to buy juice from them, which saves money and reduces my sugar intake. The taste is just right, and the packaging is just right.Last but not least - it tastes great flat. If I leave an unfinished bottle on my dinner table overnight, next morning it is flat, but still very tasty.Also, it tastes great both cold and at room temperature.Love the product and love the convenience of the regular delivery.

  We didn't think this product would go flat like soda but evidently it does.  This is just regular plain water with no sparkle.  Maybe that was why it was cheaper than regular price.  Too cumbersome to return as we took apart and put away before opening one of the bottles.  Continued use shows that all of them are flat!  Check your product before tossing the container.

  In a world full of artificial sweeteners and energy drinks, San Pellegrino is so fresh and a guilt free drink to enjoy. I would give this item a five star review but I would contend that it is a bit overpriced. At the Grocery, I can get a one liter bottle for 1.99 so I would hope Amazon will come out with a larger size. In addition, because of the dangers associated with plastic, I would love if they offered a glass option. That being said, my Pellegrino arrived safely and right at my door and the bottles were convenient to pack on the go and fit in the fridge.

  Fantastic carbonated water.  Crisp and refreshing, great tasting.  I used to buy Perrier but they're almost addicting so I read the ingredients of Perrier and they include ""natural flavors"".  It's probably nicotine or crack.  San Pellegrino is where it's at !!!  Crisp, clean and refreshing - exactly what I'm looking for.

  San Pellegrino sparkling water itself is great. It has very little fiz and tastes delicious even if it's expensive. But when you order from Amazon, it does not arrive by Amazon Prime 2-day delivery. It takes closer to a week and I didn't know that.

  What can I say? It's really d**n good sparkling water. Goes perfect with dinner and it's also great on it's own. Light, crisp taste lends itself to a variety of meals, and mineral water is already amazing; the only way to improve it is to add carbonation.

  I feel bad for UPS having to carry these to me, but I live nearly an hour from a town. Living rural has it's challenges when you were raised in a city with bubbling waters. I love my rural life, it's peaceful, but I sometimes crave the luxuries I had living in a big city. One of these is sparkling mineral water. I'm pleased to see for about the same price I can grab a 12 pack on Amazon and have it delivered. I wish they were the glass bottles as I don't care for plastic. Despite my dislike for plastic, these arrived without the normal plastic flavor. I would reorder and hope to do so again soon.

  Despite originally scoffing at the idea of paying a premium on... water... I must say that I've now been converted. San Pellegrino is the only constant beverage in my refrigerator. Whether on its own or to spritz up some juice, I don't think I've tasted anything so thirst quenching before. The question ""Do you want some S.P.?"" is asked multiple times a day in my house. The answer is always ""yes!""The original packaging has normally fallen apart by the time it reaches me, though Amazon's additional box and stuffing keeps the loose bottles sufficiently in place.Unfortunately - as mentioned by other reviewers - the recent $10 price increase has made it cheaper to purchase individual bottles at the CVS around the corner, so unless the Prime deal returns to ~ $20, I'll be going elsewhere to get my fix...

  When I received the product it was 6 month old, which is too old for carbonated water.The product had no gas. Not sure if it because it was too old or because the package was dropped during handling.Nevertheless, product is worthless and now I have to waste my time on returning the product. Total waste of time and money. It is totally unacceptable to ship 6 month old sparkling water.

  We really enjoy San Pellegrino water, and we have ordered it several times from Amazon, but there were some issues with this particular shipment. The labels on half the bottles were either askew or had come off altogether. They would not be acceptable to place on the table if we had friends over for dinner. The actual San  Pellegrino box inside the larger shipping box was damaged badly in both cases. I suggest you consider a better way to package this product before shipping.

  San Pellegrino sparkling water is my favorite day-to-day beverage, and I go through a lot of it. The 24 pack isn't available locally, so I was glad to find it on Amazon, and when I work out the price-per-bottle, it's nearly 15% less expensive than purchasing locally.Only issue is that the vendor is sometimes a bit slow to ship (last time, was nearly two weeks between order and delivery), and once we received a package that was somewhat ""flat"" compared to what we're used to.Otherwise, this is a great convenience and a fair price, and we intend to keep ordering.

  I have ordered this 12 pack from Amazon a few times now. The price is good and it's great to not have to lug bottles or boxes home from the store. The bottles fit perfectly in my wine racks, making them easy to store. The water itself is the same quality product I drank while living in Ireland and travelling in Europe. While it's good straight (or with a twist of lemon), I usually mix it with juice to lighten things up... Enjoy! (One word of caution, make sure the delivery driver has good access. My first box came sooner then expected - which was great - but they dropped it over the fence, damaging one bottle. I drank that bottle first! Lol)

  I drink this daily in place of soda.  I have it with my meals and sometimes just because I love it.  Years ago I drank Perrier but this is hands down better.  Mostly I drink it plain but every now and then I'll add some lemon or lime or orange for a change.  I don't put ice in it because I don't want to disturb the bubbles and it has plenty of fizz.  We don't offer the kids any kind of soda or pop when they come over, just Pellegrino and they have come to love it too.  Try it, you'll love it!

  Perfect alternative to soft drinks and love having them show up on my front porch with no lugging home from grocery on my own.  Highly recommend.  Added benefit, empty bottles are perfect size to use for potted plant waterers.  Just drop 1 1/2 bags of flat glass marbles, available at all dollar stores, inside empty bottle, fill with water, place finger over opening and quickly plunge into dirt in potted plant a couple of inches down so bottle stays upright and water slowly dribbles out.  Your plants will love it and it will keep them happy while you are away.
