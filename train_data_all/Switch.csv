  When I first received the switch I was so excited. Everything was in the box and it looked brand new.  At first I didn’t have enough to buy any physical games so I bought some games for sale on the E shop. And it worked great! But only till after the return date passed did I realize, the game card reader was broken! When I first played one of the games it seemed to work fine. But later when I removed the game and I inserted it again, it told me it couldn’t read the game card. Easy enough, just restarting the switch made it read. But now months have past and the only game card it seems to read is animal crossing. All my other games just wont read. Even a brand new copy of Minecraft. Since I believe I still have warranty, I wanted to contact Nintendo for repairs but it’s been shut down due to COVID. I hope I can get this fix. I’m very disappointed.

  Playing switch games is great, i bought 5 games with my system for variety. Turns out the most amazing feature i was not aware of before i started playing. The online subscription they offer for a measly 20 bucks a year offers a library of nes and snes games you can play at will. You can save state in them as well up to 4 save files for each game. You can ALSO reverse time when playing (it is a cheap feature but VERY cool still) Died in mario, just hold in two buttons, reverse the game like a dvr on tv show and bam, try that part again right where you just were!! i do not know if it is true but i read they have two more slots for future classic systems in their coding in the system. We have Nintendo 8bit, Super Nintendo but we could see Nintendo 64 or game cube in the future as well.All 5 games i picked up for it run great as well, no complaints except it was 150 dollars more than list price. Alas these are the times we live in.

  I was suppose to receive my package October 27th. I didn't receive my package until the 29th. It wasn't Amazon fought at all. I blame USPS for screwing up. They sent my package to the wrong address. So I had to go online and have them redeliver my package.When I finally receive my package I notice it wasn't damaged or tampered with. The switch box was still intact thank God. One thing I notice is the switch itself looks more premium if that makes any type of sense. Lol You can tell they fixed a lot issues with the joycons and other things. My OG switch had so many flaws. My TV screen would go black then turn back on for some reason while playing. The vents on my switch ended up melting off. The back had so many scratches from the dock.Anywho, the battery life is amazing!! If you're like me and you play your switch an hour a day. It will last for a couple days. If you're the type that play your switch for hrs. You can get up to 9hrs of play depending on the game you're playing.Im glad I got the upgraded version. 5/5

  Nintendo left consumers out of luck on this one, no new stocking dates, leaving price gougers to upcharge, the Nintendo switch is not a terrible console but the specs are not worth anywhere close to $500, It comes with a 720p screen. Almost everything has a better screen than this by now. don't pay the same price of ps4 or Xbox one for something that's made from $150 (probably even cheaper) worth of parts.

  I'm suppose to love the Switch, but I don't.  I think it's a bad deal overall.1) Nintendo Online doesn't offer much compared to the Wii virtual console days.  There's no Metroid games from the GC/Wii/Advance era.  Nearly all the games for the switch look like something from the 90's when flash games were popular. But the games are priced as if they're made out of gold.2) The frame rate on this console is poor. Yeah, some games reach a respectable 30fps, but I'd say most games fall below that.3) The dock is very woobly, it doesn't lock in, and it's very easy to scratch up the screen.4) There is no wired connection out of the box.  Why should I have to buy an adapter for that?  If you play online seriously, you use a wired connection.5) Here's what really bugs me.  There's no web browser on this thing.  No web browser for a mobile device? Are you kidding me?  This also leads to bizarre consequences.  Since there's no reviews on the Nintendo store, you're forced to go to third party sites for reviews... but you can't, because there's no web browser.  LMAO! And I had to create my nintendo account on a PC!  ROFL!Conclusion:I'll stick with the PC, Xbox and Playstation.  If these issues ever get resolved, I'll reconsider.  It's an interesting design, but it's all hype - little value.  $300 is way overboard for this gimmicky soy toy.

  I bought this system for myself as a birthday present, and I have enjoyed using it!  The controllers took a bit getting used to detaching on and off properly.  I think the main thing is to be careful about what games you buy if the device will be worth it to you in the end, or if you are excited about upcoming games.  I waited to purchase the Switch until I knew there were about ten games I wanted to play and added about three of them into the in initial cost as well.  I’m pretty picky about my games because I am a casual gamer. Zelda breath of the wild—which I borrowed from my brother later— is more intensive than anything I have played in YEARS.Games are expensive in physical format, although that is my preference.  There are some cheaper games on the online store.  So far my favorite local game shop does not have any used copies of Switch games although they have everything else.  Maybe some day.I might buy a screen protector for it in the future but have not as of yet.  If your Switch is to see heavy use by an entire family or if as an owner you plan to travel with it I’d recommend one but that is not the case for me. I did have a problem within a month of ordering the machine where the fan started whirring LOUDLY.  At first only when it was plugged in to charge then all the time when it was at rest, then at last even while playing a game.  I called Nintendo customer service and had it repaired (although I had to send it back three times with the same issue to a radioshack in Syracuse NY.  Last time I sent it in they just replaced the system.)If I have a problem in the future I will request replacement rather than repair, especially if it’s going back to New York.  Just not happening.  At least customer service was good, but I was becoming a bit disgruntled toward the end there with their techs!  For my troubles customer service gave me a new set of controllers automatically and then later, three months free on the eshop.  Oh, and the second and third shipments were two day free.

  It's really nice to take your console game anywhere you want! It sucks that Nintendo didn't give us enough storage space, so make sure you buy a microSD card to store your games and their content. I read that it's better to buy the physical game discs. They take up less space, but if you want to download all of your games go for it. If you play a medium amount of games I would recommend the 256GB - 512GB microSD cards. There is a 1TB microSD card on amazon for around $300.00. Get this one if you're a hardcore Nintendo player. There are many accessories on amazon to also decorate your Switch. You can decorate the controllers with skins or buy the different color joy-cons. The exclusive Pickachu one has nice Pichachu designs on the stand, and I think there's also an Eevee version both from Japan that cost $500 or more. You can also buy the Switch Lite which seems much more available now with the pandemic raging. Explore and find the version of Switch that works for you.

  Many things could be said about this device but, there's so many things that make up for it.Seamless connectivity with mostly everything. Joy-cons(controllers) connect right away once attached through wireless electrical conduction like a power mat.The U.I. makes me happy. ((Home screen(desktop) layout))The different ways have use the controllers are interesting indeed:Like, Smash Ultimate, if you have one joycons set you split the controllers into two controllers for you friend or friends (if you have a second controller set) to play locallyBreath Of The Wild, with the aiming mechanic by steadily rotating wrist(which is optional)The Ease of purchasing games is and points towards a discount is fair.Nintendo polish is not joke.👍Joycons do once in awhile lose sync with Device but reconnects in 2-10 seconds and can disrupt gameplay a tad but you get over it a few seconds because your totally immersed with yourself.So I give it a 100% green light on the a virtuous mission. Spread you wings and fly, God be with you.

  The animal crossing edition is absolutely beautiful. It DOES NOT come with the game, just FYI to those who are looking to get this edition. I already had the game since I originally played on a switch lite. However, I think if you are an animal crossing fan this is fantastic in every way possible. I am so happy with my purchase. It only took 3 days to receive the switch even though it originally was 5-6 weeks estimated delivery. Please don't pay more than $299.99 for this console. Have patience and it will be available, check often and you will get one.

  Got this to replace a Switch that was in for repairs because I missed Animal Crossing too much and I couldn't resist the special edition being available at regular price!I've only used it for a day so far but I've had a few issues with the joycons disconnecting randomly. No more than a mild annoyance so far but not an issue I had with my old Switch even after a year of near-daily play.Happy to see Switches being available for $300 again after 8 months of quarantine price gouging. As much as I love my Switch I wouldn't pay the $400+ some jerks have been asking while they're in low supply.

    Best battery life, largest screen and HD rumble make this a better buy than the Lite version.
  
",4.0,Chrissy,"Reviewed in the United States December 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  I don’t use this the way that Nintendo advertises; predominantly hand held.  I have the Skull & Company Grip Case attached at all times and only play in handheld mode.  The Switch Lite is too small and doesn’t have the HD rumble like this one has.  This model is the better one with the longest battery life currently available.  This is not designed with comfort in mind for handheld play sessions so the Lite may be a better option if comfort is important.  If you get hand cramps like I do, I highly recommend the Skull & Company grip case.  They also have a great travel case that you can get with it that has plenty of space for the switch with case and joycons attached and space for games, a power adapter and power bank.  It is very good quality and the Switch is dockable with the grip case attached.The switch itself has a much faster, more user friendly, prettier, less congested graphics user interface than all of Nintendo’s previous consoles.  It has a solid state drive for saving and downloading some games, and is expandable with the purchase of Micro SD cards for additional space.  The online store is easy to use and probably the best Nintendo has ever had.  Easy to sort by price, genre, developer.  It is fast and easy to use and you can sort for free games and demos too.  The load time between starting games and between cut scenes in game is very quick on hard drive, sd card, and game cartridge.  Much quicker than nintendo’s previous consoles.  I haven’t played with the joy cons detached so I can’t comment on how responsive the joycons are to movement and player interaction when joycons are detached.  The HD rumble is more subtle than on PS4 and XBox but some games have used it very well.  Mario Odyssey for example has done a great job of blending the environments in some levels to match well with the rumble feedback; its hard to explain, but this feels like the next step in controller evolution and PS5 and NextBox will be adopting a similar tech so more developers should get on board with HD Rumble in future games, hopefully.  The switch buttons have a nice click and feel like they will last, much like most of Nintendo’s products but the stick feels a little looser than the PS4.  I would like Nintendo to tighten that up for the Pro version.  Overall, this is decades of Nintendo engineering in the making which has resulted in, arguably their best console to date.  It is going to shatter console sales records for good reason.  I highly recommend this version of the Switch for the battery life, larger screen and hd rumble, but you may want to get a comfort grip if you will be using it predominantly as a handheld.  I no longer play on my 3DS because this is a much better player experience.

  We bought this for my 7-year-old son's birthday & he couldn't be happier!! This is by far the most adorable Nintendo switch console out there!! I definitely recommend purchasing it.We bought it when it was $300 plus tax. I do not recommend paying any more than that price.. just wait till it gets back in stock & buy it for $300. Do not purchase it from greedy scalpers.. keep an eye out because as soon as it gets in stock it sells out usually the same day! We are so fortunate we were able to get one in time for my son's birthday ..we purchased this back in October & held on to it till December for his birthday. If you want one for Christmas, I doubt you will be able to get one at the $300 price ..unfortunately it's sold out till mid January.. but if you can I say go ahead & get it! This thing is adorable & really is a great collector item for any Nintendo fan! Even if they aren't into animal crossing. It is a very unisex design. I believe it can be for a boy or a girl. 👍

",5.0,Chao C.,"Reviewed in the United States February 20, 2021","









  
  
    
  As someone who's been playing on the PS4, the Nintendo Switch is a great change of pace. This is my ever handheld gaming device and I got to say, man is it impressive!For starters, the design of the switch is awesome, not too heavy or light. Every time you slip the joycons on the side of the switch, it makes a satisfying click sound. The dock is great for playing games on your TV or monitor (plus it looks clean too). After spending about 10 hours on the switch, I am satisfied with the joycons and feel no need to purchase the pro controller. Although the joycons are a bit small (perfect for kids), they will get the job done. Next, it is important that you take storage into consideration since the switch only comes with a base of 32 gb. I bought the SanDisk 128 gb card and that will be enough for me. If you plan on playing games like Mortal Kombat, I'd suggest upgrading to 200 and above, since those games take up more storage (ex. MK11 Aftermath is 30 gb). Depending on how much you play, battery life will vary. Of course, more labor-intensive games will drain the battery quicker. I only have two games on my switch so far (Attack on Titan and Fortnite) and those games tend to drain the battery significantly faster. I don’t have any other games to compare to, but while playing AoT, the battery lasted about 4-5 hours before needing a charge. This is super impressive since AoT is an open-world style game with dozens of titans running around the map destroying buildings and such, but frames will drop from time to time if there too much going on at once. Even after playing for a long time, the switch is only some-what warm, which is great if you are playing in handheld mode. Lastly, I want to talk about the price point of the switch. The retail price is $299.99 and that's what I paid for when I bought the Mario Version. It's a steep price since it's alongside the price point of an Xbox or PS4, but it is worth it if you enjoy playing games on the go and love Nintendo titles such as Zelda and Mario. In addition to the retail price of the console, also take into account other expenses such as extra storage (I would only buy the ones from Nintendo, SanDisk, or Samsung), a screen protector (very important in my opinion. The first thing I did when I unboxed the switch was to put on a screen protector), extra controllers and/or joycons, and maybe Nintendo's online membership if you want to play online and with friends (games like Fortnite will not need a membership).All in all, the switch is a great device and I can't recommend it enough. It's a great console for families or if you just want to play alone.

However being what it is the Switch itself is fairly fragile.  If your child has the self control of Angry German Kid(tm) this would not be the best gift for them.  And if playing it in undocked mode understand by all that is holy that the Nintendo Switch is not a modern smartphone.  There is no water resistance built into the design.  Submerging the switch or even spilling something onto it will likely be the end of the console.  The docking port is another point of fragility.  It won't suffer being slammed into the dock well.  All of the weight of the unit is baring down on that port while docking so being gentle and sorta gingerly easing it down is advised.  The Joycons are also rather fragile.  Not flimsy but they won't tolerate mauling like let's say a PS1 controller could take.That being said I do not think the Switch is cheaply made at all despite these points.  The owner and operator just has to accept that they need to be gentle and they'll be fine.  And I don't mean you need to treat it like a china cup.  But this is NOT the kind of console for a roid rage neanderthal hopped up on Monster drinks and adrenaline.

  If you’re willing to wait, Amazon occasionally gets some, and puts them up at regular price.  Received mine much sooner than their initial estimate. As for the console... it’s fun, everyone knows that. Great first-party games, and a nice selection of third-party games. Okay battery, unusual but feature-packed controllers, and a tiny bit uncomfortable for extended play in handheld mode. Less powerful than its competitors, but ray tracing does not a good game make.Just do everyone a favor and don’t pay a scalper for the console. That’s the only way to choke them out. Stay patient and check multiple stores, regularly. Eventually you’ll find one at the proper price. You’ll have your dignity, do a service for the community, and definitely get your money’s worth!

  First I would like to say the switch came in perfect New condition and the colors of the console was nice. No issues setting it up and it does what it suppose to. With that being said, I wasn't impressed with the Nintendo switch at all. It's extremely basic and does nothing that the Nintendo wii U can't do. It's a money grabber you have to pay a membership for older super Nintendo games instead of a one time purchase. I've had a Nintendo wii u since they came out, had it replaced some years ago and it still works perfect. I didn't see any reason to spend 320.00 for new console that didn't do anything special. Yes I returned it and I'm back with my wii u and still love it !!!

  I really wanted to be able to play video games while I was at work. I am a doctor and some nights just are slow since I work ER/Overnight. This was the easiest route for me to have the ability to game. Only issue I would say is the fact you need a capture card if you want to share with your friends via discord. Other than that, its easy to set up with TV/Just use with joycons. Accessories are expensive and so are games so I suggest figuring out exactly what you want and looking for sales etc. Also google how to make sure you are getting the new model since they are selling the old model with the same name. Theres a few things you can do to ensure you are getting the newest!

  I've been wanting a switch for a long time, and finally managed to get my hands on one close to MSRP (at $307) during the pandemic. I only have one game on it so far, but to say I'm pleased and impressed so far is a bit of an understatement. It's nice to be able to play on my TV in the living room, and when someone else wants to play their own game or watch Netflix, I can just take the switch out of the dock and play in handheld mode, but stay in the same room and socialize. I like being able to bring the game into my room and not be forced to play it in the living room if I don't want to deal with all the noise.It's pleasant to hold, with just a bit of weight to it to feel sturdy. The Joycons are nice to the touch, although the sticks are a little too 'smooth' for my liking so I put some grips on. I haven't experienced any drift, yet, but it's only been a few days. They're very satisfying to hold, and even more satisfying to click into place on either the tablet or the included joy-con grip. I haven't tried the straps yet.The screen is lovely, and the speakers are front-facing so it seems louder than other handhelds. It IS a little frustrating to adjust the volume while I have it on the kickstand. The kickstand is a pain to pull out, and isn't sturdy in the slightest.Overall I'm very, very happy with it. I can't wait to get more games on it and play with friends.

    Elegant compromise between handheld and console
  
",5.0,C. Petit,"Reviewed in the United States November 5, 2019","









  
  
    
  In terms of raw horsepower (CPU, graphics, whatever) the Nintendo Switch is far behind the current generation of consoles like the XBox One.  But, the Switch is a unique device.  As a handheld, it is quite powerful (the latest iteration nearly doubles the handheld's battery life, addressing the Switch's greatest weakness).  This allows you to play the same game on your TV and keep playing it as you take it out with you --- a unique ability.Most importantly, there is a staggering array of software available for it.  Software is what makes or breaks a console, no matter how good it is.For example the Zelda game ""Breath of the Wild"" is a visual stunner with a huge open world.  And this is the first portable system that has the full version of Skyrim available for it (the reason I bought it --- a high quality port of Skyrim with the 3 add-on packs).  Nintendo has also done high quality ports of other gems from older consoles such as ""Mario Kart 8"" as well as a lot of new titles such as ""Super Smash Brothers Ultimate"" or ""Luigi's Mansion 3"".In addition,their digital store has a lot of quality indie games such as Stardew Valley.Also, if you purchase the Nintendo Switch Online membership ($20/year) Nintendo also gives you a large selection of NES and SNES classic games.  The membership is worthwhile for that alone.Basically, because Nintendo is ONLY selling the Switch as a current console (the 3DS is on its way out), all of their best software goes to the one console.  And that gives developers strong incentives to bring their best titles over as well.If you want a wide variety of games, the Switch is a good choice.  If you want THE best console graphics or performance, obviously the Switch isn't for you.

  Our household doesn’t buy the latest, greatest gaming systems but it was time to upgrade our original Wii for another family friendly system. The reviews were pretty glowing for the Switch and I can say they’re warranted. Just make sure you buy the newer generation (this product) so you have better battery life and less decline over the life of the product.I love how Nintendo the Parental Controls essentially live within an app on the parent’s phone. A motivated kid can hack just about anything so keeping these settings non-local is a brilliant little safeguard. My kids have to ask me for “more time” when they’ve hit a daily limit (which is customizable for the day of the week). It’s very much like a simpler, more reliable version of Apple’s Screen Time feature on iPhones. Of course, you can also unlock more time on the switch itself using a pin code.It’s also worth mentioning that Nintendo did a great job with the “user assisted driving” feature on Mario Kart that helps young kids and inexperienced gamers be competitive. It really is nice to bring my youngest daughter into the joy of Mario Karting.

The dock is adorable. A refreshing alternative to the standard black. As soon as I took the Switch out of the box I applied a tempered glass screen protector on it.  I was also able to transfer user data and save data over from my old Switch to this new one. Something I wasn’t aware I could do, which was a very nice surprise.

  I absolutely loved the concept of the Nintendo Switch and decided to get one due to its popular demand. It’s pretty awesome and best to get it at the normal price of $299.99 because it really isn’t worth $300.00+ and it really refreshes the gaming atmosphere. However, handheld mode is so enormous that it’s a little uncomfortable. I was on the fence about buying this or the Nintendo Switch Lite, because I rarely have anyone else around to play some really cool multiplayer games like Mario Kart 8 Deluxe or Super Smash Bros. Plus, the Switch Lite doesn’t come with controller/joy con problems and is smaller, more comfortable, and accessible. One other thing that stands out on the Lite is it has a smaller screen but games look a bit sharper on it. That said, some of the free games are pretty addictive! I think it was totally worth the $300.00, but it does cost $20 to buy Nintendo Online to play any Nintendo game’s online player. I also wouldn’t recommend buying a Pro controller because the joy con controller is pretty comfortable, so far. If you’re someone who loves hanging around friends and family, get the regular Switch. If you’re a solo and lone wolf type of badass, get the Switch Lite!

    Nintendo Switch w/Grey joy cons V2 HAC-001(-01)
  
",5.0,Mr. James,"Reviewed in the United States December 7, 2019","









  
  
    
  This review is for the Nintendo Switch w/Grey joycons, V2 HAC-001(-01). I've owned the original Switch(HAC 001) and recently, the Switch Lite(Turquoise). Battery life wasn't so good with the original Switch and only a bit better with the Lite. This Switch model has improved battery life, up to 40% depending on brightness settings, volume settings, and the type of game you're playing. Another thing I've noticed is if you download digital games, it takes less time. The graphics(colors) seem to be more vibrant.If you're a gamer who likes to play games on the T.V exclusively, this would be the perfect choice. On the other hand,someone who enjoys gaming on the go, might find it cumbersome carrying this console around. It won't fit in your pocket. Just something to keep in mind.Lastly; if you buy plenty of digital games, a micro sd card of 32-128gb is a must. Another basic necessity would be a glass screen protector, as the plastic screen does scratch easily. There are two models, one with the grey joy cons and one with the red and blue joy cons. The Switch with the red and blue joy cons seems to be the rarer model and is sought after by gamers for it's resell value. There are plenty of games available for the Switch, something for everyoneand more to come. If you have your old Switch, it isn't really necessary to upgrade to this newer model. However; just for the improved battery life, I would recommend it.

  Everything about the physical device, i feel like is pretty well made. Good set up, some minor future issues that are mitigated by screen protectors and similar. Several easy to work with ways to play it, kinda fun in its novelties on its build.My issue?1) games are ridiculously expensive. So many are over priced.2) Online play required by Nintendo for a not good service is poor. Especially for things like minecraft.3) Where are any older games. The games that Nintendo has no need to keep out of the store. The old pokemon, Zelda games, or any games really. Like, great you are putting witcher 3 on there...But not Orignal Zelda and Ocherina of time?Physical? Great! Nintendo online and games? Bad. 1 or 2 games does not make the switch worth buying. PC has better prices, easier to work with, and you can play almost any game out there.

  I finally caved and got one (of course at retail price. It’s great so far, I love it. The box came on time and in good condition. Very easy set-up!I’ve never had a console before, so this is my first official one!! I was considering between this and the lite, but I think it’s totally worth it getting this one. I like to have the option to play it on my TV. I also didn’t think the switch screen would be that big but it’s actually a decent size.The controllers are so bright, especially the red. I wasn’t expecting neon pink. I’ve seen videos and pictures of the switch, but it’s nothing compared to seeing it in-person.I was iffy about buying it on Amazon, even if it was from Amazon themselves instead of resellers, but this turned out great.

    Constant Hardware Failure
  
",1.0,Jack,"Reviewed in the United States December 29, 2019","









  
  
    
  My screen was blank the first time i turned it on though I could still hear the sound of the menu.  It took a call to Nintendo to figure out how to fix it.  Not really what you expect from a $350 dollar product.  I did a hard reboot and put it in maintenance mode to fix it which only worked for a few weeks.  Now the screen is completely dead.  This really doesn't look good for Nintendo's quality control seeing that the Switch failed to perform out of the box.  Furthermore, I have had read numerous other stories online of people experiencing the same thing.  Nintendo needs to get better hardware and quality control processes.  The last Nintendo system I owned was an N64 which was a brick house and never had any problems.  The Switch just feels cheap.

    It has its pros & cons..but more pros!
  
",5.0,Blake ,"Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought the Switch a few months ago and now that I’ve spent some time with it (more than I’d like to admit ^_^) I wanted to leave a review.The Switch has many pros over other consoles, it’s main pro being that it’s a portable console with games that previously are only found on PC or console. I am a PC gamer and my PC is an absolute beast with an 8700K & 2080 Ti BUT the reason I bought a Switch is because oftentimes I am out and about and can’t bring my big honkin’ PC with me. Obviously I prefer my PC but it’s nice to be able to play games like Witcher 3 and then  when I have to go somewhere in the car or something I can seamlessly “Switch” to the Switch and continue my game.There are some absolutely AMAZING games on the Switch: Zelda: Breath of the Wild, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, Witcher 3, Splatoon, Super Smash Ultimate, etc., which are worth buying the Switch. This is especially true for people with kids as most of Nintendo’s big hits are kid friendly. You may not want your very young children to play violent games like Call of Duty or Battlefield 5 but they can definitely play a similar kind of game with Splatoon 2 only instead of shooting bullets to kill people they’re splattering paint all over each other.However the Switch also has its cons. Let’s start with Nintendo’s “E-Shop”. The E-shop sells games that are WAY overpriced. They charge $59.99 USD for games that have been out for years. The fact is you can buy physical copies of these games for less on Amazon AND you have the benefit of being able to resell the game later if you want too. Not so with digital games.Then there is the price. Yes the Switch is $299 which is cheaper than Microsoft and Sony’s consoles but when you factor in the cost of necessities that are almost required for optimal play (Pro Controller, SD card, Screen Protector) the cost adds up quickly.All in all though I do recommend the Nintendo Switch. It’s a great console for anyone who just wants to have a good time and it’s especially great for families or people with young kids who want to play games with them without worrying about violence, drug use, sexual situations, etc., that are in a lot of other games.5/5 Stars

  So, I did some research and bought this switch because it is advertised as the 'NEW' model with serial number beginning with 'XKW'. It is said to have better battery life, possibly a boosted processor, and generally just be an updated switch model. That being said, the old discontinued model still retails for the same amount. I checked my model on my 'NEW AND IMPROVED' switch, and it is the sane as my 2018 switch XAW. Needless to say, I am rather disappointed in Amazon. I installed all my games, transferred data, and now I am stuck with wiping and returning it or just settling for a mediocre version of the switch. Thanks for the annoyance Amazon! Also, the left Joy-con bumper was broken right out of the box! It was also covered in grease. $300 for outdated switch, and a broken controller. I don't normally leave nasty reviews, but I'm pretty bummed. Also nintendo will switch out the outdated one, but I have to ship it to them!

  The system is great. A lot of free games to download. Battery life can be better but good enough. Screen is large enough, but can be bigger.Games are more expensive then other consoles. Example 3rd party games $19.99 on other consoles PS4. Switch $39.99 to $49.99.No web browsing, no Netflix and other video apps besides Hulu and YouTube.Switch back stand feels flimsy. Seems it will brake if you use too much force. No Bluetooth headphones compatibility. Need extra dongle for that. Hands feels cramped up holding device after some time.

  Amazing Console/handheld device! Don’t crap on the product in reviews but crap on the scalpers! Most of the reviews for switches that don’t work are probably people who’ve bought from 3rd party.I bought from SHIP & SOLD BY AMAZON. It came with little dust and packaging particles but I believe it was just from the warehouse storage that got into the hole the box has. I’ve been playing multiplayer for 2hrs now and it works perfectly fine! If you can wait, don’t buy 3rd party and do AMAZON. Totally worth it and really, really cute! I bought it MSRP btw ($299). No overpriced, scalped switch!Shipping: I bought it as a pre-order for the next month. It changed to arriving next week to this Sunday for me! There’s a chance it will be the same for you too! So if you can wait, be patient, look out for pre-orders (they are available every now and then) & buy it MSRP ($299)! It’ll be worth it!UPDATE AFTER 1 DAY:Just found out 1 vent on the back of the switch is loose and your able to push it in. I don’t know if this will be okay but review looses a star for this :(. Works great but slight defect.

I constantly looked at BestBuy, GameStop, Walmart, Target and others with no success. Both Amazon and EBay were too high priced. I told my son it was doubtful he would get one in time for Christmas and he had accepted that. Then a miracle happened and I found this Amazon seller who sold it for MSRP, plus shipped it quickly so we got it in time for Christmas! Highly recommend! Thank you. It works great too!

  I wish I could give negative stars for Nintendo. This was purchased as a gift for the kids for Christmas after recommendations from some friends. I still don’t get any appeal to Nintendo? We have only had it open for 2 days and already both JoyCons are complete toast. The drift in both is so bad that you can’t make right turns playing Mario Kart. I checked the calibration and followed a number of online tutorials for things to try, but to no avail. Come to find out, there is a class action lawsuit against Nintendo for this very problem. Apparently the solution is to send the controllers to Nintendo and wait a month for them to diagnose and maybe repair them. This is probably why I haven’t thought about the brand Nintendo for almost 20 years since I last owned any of their products. I’ve owned virtually every gaming console created and never once had this issue with any other controllers. If you are so desperate to play outdated video games with Nintendo level quality that enduring this garbage is worth it to you, then more power to you. I’m fine dumping this console in the trash and going back to forgetting Nintendo even exists for the next 20 years. I’ll stick to Xbox.

  I purchased this for myself for Xmas, because I wanted to play with my kids.  After about 4 hrs of game play, the left stick started drifting to the right.  I mentioned it to my kids and they informed me that ""stick drift"" is a common issue with the Switch.  Why would you pay for a product that that has a known defect that the manufacturer has no intention of correcting?  Better yet, why would Nintendo sell one?  The games are wildly overpriced.  Games are less expensive and better on other consoles if you are hooking it to a TV.I have since returned it.  I'm bummed.  I was looking forward to having some family fun.  I will not recommend this product to anyone.

",4.0,Andrew n.,"Reviewed in the United States December 3, 2020","









  
  
    
  It's a good console. It's not amazing. There is a limited selection of AAA games, more so if you like action and FPS genres. You have more than enough RPGs to choose from and a lot of the Asian anime style games (not sure what they're called). Nintendo's own selection is PG as always. It sounds odd to say this, but my mistake was buying this when I'm not a Nintendo fan. The lack of support from major developers and studios means that I eventually turned to a laptop to meet my real gaming needs.PROS:Gaming on the move: great on airiplanes and to bring on tripsEasy couch coop for supported gamesHolds charge for a good amount of timeMain console body is durable AF. I dropped mine down a flight of stairs and it had no dentsCONS:Joycons are a straight rip-off. They will fail on you then you'll have to pay 40-60 USD for replacementsLimited game selection (this is the biggest issue). Almost none of the large developers are supporting the Switch. Some of them are trying, but the Switch hardware is already behind the times with current-gen releases and you get knocked-down graphics. EA gives you remasters or roster updates, Take Two remasters decade old releases, etc. and all of these are released at crazy prices. You pay US$ 40 for games being sold for $5 on PCs and consoles, it's ridiculous.

  I love my Switch, this console really brings me back to my childhood, there is something about it that recaptured that magic I felt playing my Super Nintendo and even the GameCube. I've played every Nintendo console and while I was a major fan of the early ones, after the Cube, I got sucked into the Xbox 360 and then the PS4, but, this console is the first I've played in years that brings me back to that childhood magic. I got this console on a whim after watching Detective Pikachu and realizing how much I missed Pokémon games, so I had to get Let's Go Pikachu and pre-order Pokémon Shield, as well as getting back into Mario, and checking out Fire Emblem Warriors which is totally amazing. All in all, not only are the exclusive games amazing, but, the console and even the joycon controller rig are something special. I can't put my finger on it, and I really can't put it into words, but this is a great system and for kids or those trying to rediscover the child inside of them, this is a must have. Just don't try to get inside a child with this is, or you're going to jail sicko.

  I already own a Switch but wanted to pick one up for my fiancee to have fun during quarantine.

Managed to pick up a used one (that looked virtually new) from Amazon Warehouse for about $240, which was a steal. She is really enjoying it and slowly becoming a regular gamer (1-2 hours a day), and the Switch has several games that are great for newcomers.

The seller was also very helpful and the switch arrived much earlier than expected and on my birthday, coincidentally.

  The only time I’ve used a Switch has been playing on one that my friends own. Just these experiences has really intrigued me into getting my very own Switch. I love playing video games and I own an Xbox and PS4, so I figure at some point it was time to complete the trifecta. While I’m more of an Xbox person, I will say I am very impressed by the Switch. It is a very simple console, but genius in of itself. I’ve had some Nintendo gaming devices here and there. A SNES back in the day, but mostly their portable ones from the Gameboy to the Advanced to the DS and 3DS. The Switch combines that of a home console and a portable gaming device and for that I love it. I can put it in the dock and play it on my TV. I can play it handheld which will be great for road trips or maybe just wanting to play anywhere. This was a brilliant move by Nintendo and it makes the Switch really stand on its own.Now what I’d say my favorite thing about the console is it’s simplicity. This device is made for one thing only and that is for playing video games. The console is both modern and old school at the same time. Would definitely recommend to anyone who really likes Nintendo and their games.

  The switch is a great game system but my blue joy-con broke within a couple days of playing with it.

We had planned a big road trip and I was hoping the switch would keep him entertained but because of the broken controller, it was useless the whole time. Nintendo has a warranty on it, but being holiday season I haven’t gone through their “process” of returning it and getting a new one. All I can say is its been a very disappointing experience with this Nintendo product delivered by Amazon. Just sucks something so expensive can break so easy.

    Won my sisters heart!
  
",5.0,SophiA,"Reviewed in the United States March 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  Alright so since the Covid-19 outbreak has officially ruined my sisters senior year she had started getting into animal crossing. After playing on the I Phone app for what felt like forever she decided she wanted to transition to a game on the 3ds console. Since she had started playing animal crossing new leaf she fell in love with the series. So as her big sister I had decided I would get her this limited edition themed switch in hopes of helping with her depression as well as to cheer her up for her senior year being ruined. Also so she could get a taste of Animal Crossing new horizons for when it comes out March 20th, 2020!  The day I told her I purchased it she hopped with joy. I was excited too considering I was sharing my own excitement for animal crossing with my sister. It had finally arrived. Its box didn't come in damaged and the console was packed safely to prevent possible damages. It works perfectly as any nintendo switch should with no defects at all in the console itself. The only concerns I have to remind future buyers is that the joycons will stop working properly after a year of use. This is coming from my own nintendo switch experiences and other fellow switch owners where the controls will drift randomly while you're trying to play a game after a year after consistant use. So I'd be best to invest in a second set of controllers just in case.All I have left to say is that this was indeed worth my money and my sister couldn't be happier with her early senior graduation gift!

    Love the Switch - A Casual Gamer's Best Console
  
",5.0,Sherlockian,"Reviewed in the United States September 6, 2019","









  
  
    
  This is my review of the 'V2' (2019) version of the Nintendo Switch (model #HAC-001(-01)).So a little background, I was a enthusiastic PC gamer in college who built my own PCs for the purpose and am now - due to the demands of adulthood - someone who only plays the occasional game. My last handheld Nintendo console was the black and white Game Boy Pocket in the early 90's, so I've been away from the platform ---- a while.I bought the Switch purely because I learned they had ported Skyrim to it, and as a huge fan of the Elder Scrolls genre I was hoping to devote some of my train commute to questing around Tamriel. In this sense, the Switch does not disappoint. I am not a graphics connoisseur, but - compared to the PC version - Skryim plays really well on the Switch. No perceptible lag, colors are crisp. Yes, it's missing the expansions and yes, the text can be a little small, but that's a fair trade-off for the portability this platform brings.So far, I only own 2 games - Skyrim and MarioKart 8 (another throwback to my college dorm days on the N64), and I love playing both on the Switch, MaroKart is obviously the newer game and so the graphics and gameplay are much better but I'm a still a sucker for Skyrim (at least until the next ES is released, hopefully in my lifetime).Anyway, all this to say the Nintendo Switch is a great console for busy adults who want to reminisce about the fun they had 10, 20, or even 30 years ago. The Switch doesn't take itself too seriously (which I love) but that means it might not be the right choice for people concerned with the perfect graphic or gameplay experience - there are dedicated consoles that do this much better. What the Switch does is make gaming on the go effortless, fun for the average busy person and something you can really enjoy with your whole family - which I think was Nintendo's real goal here all along.

    Love the ACNH switch
  
",5.0,Stefan Berger,"Reviewed in the United States January 17, 2021","









  
  
    
  Call me crazy.....I bought the original switch a while ago and never played Animal Crossing before. When everyone was talking about New Horizon during the start of the Pandemic, I thought to give it a shot. Boy, I should not have done it :) I started spending all my free time paying off my loans to Tom Nook, hunting for villagers and trying to decorate my Island. Like many, I got kinda bored after everything was unlocked and got tired of the Villagers repeating the same over and over again. I thought of resetting my Island, but didn't want to lose everything I had worked for so hard. Then Nintendo announce to release the ACNH special edition switch again and beside I didn't like the idea of buying another switch, it was a great opportunity to start another Island with an ACNH themed switch. Anyway, I didn't regret spending another $299 - the switch is VERY cute and fits perfectly on my shelf. Beside still having my old switch with a developed, but basically abandoned  Island I mostly play on the new ACNH switch now. I know it's very hard to reset your Island, but if you don't have the money to buy another system, you may want to consider it. Starting from scratch actually  does bring a lot of the lost magic back.

  Okay so this is going to be a review with my overall experience. Yes, it was overpriced, I think this was worth it, I personally got it for the Joy-cons, and I don't regret it, because you really don't know when you will get the opportunity to get one for less. Anyways, arrived in perfect condition, first switch ever, the only thing that was wrong is the Left Bumper on the Joy-con, which i don't know how to explain it but kind of loose, more than the Right Bumper. It bothers me because of something on the inside, and also since I paid a lot for this switch but not enough to complain, its just something i'll have to live with. But besides that, it was a great experience, the bumper was the only thing that gave me a fright since it feels very weird. Now I don't have anything to play since my game doesn't arrive until Wednesday, but just downloading free games is fun, but originally there is only 25gb so I would recommend getting a micro SD, but i think that's all.

  I’m late to the switch party, but so glad I came. Haha. It’s 100% worth it. I got the gray, so it’d be more subtle. Figuring out how it works is very easy & it’s quick to catch on. I have downloaded all the classic mario games, YouTube & Hulu. It’s SUCH a throwback to see all the classics again & hear those familiar sounds. The Nintendo membership is only $20 a year, which gives you access to all those free classics, so in my opinion, it’s absolutely worth it. I use it everyday, whether to watch movies, or play games. I love it so much & would highly recommend.

  This item was a hot item during the pandemic which made it almost impossible to buy. When it was available they were being sold at unbelievable prices. So imagine my luck after months searching for a switch to buy they suddenly became available again in September. I bought it quickly with the intent to hold onto it as a Christmas gift for my children. Bad mistake. Now 2 weeks after Christmas the controller that was included with the switch is not working. It has drift issues so it won't let my children go to the left and keeps moving to the right without them doing anything. I figured okay, it must be defective so I will call Amazon and hopefully they can fix this for me or just send me a new controller. Apparently NOT. Amazon says the item is out of the return window and there is nothing they can do. Now here I am stuck with a controller that lasted 8 days total and apparently prices are between 79 and 108 just for a replacement controller. Complete waste of money.

  A Nintendo Switch with extended battery life? What's not to love? It's a no-brainer! Nintendo is always at the forefront of console innovation and they didn't miss a beat with the Switch. Want to play a game on your tv like a traditional console? Drop the Switch into the dock and game on in 1080p HD. Need to hit the road? Slide the Switch out of the dock and continue your gaming on the go in brilliant 720p HD. And I haven't even gotten into the built-in option for multiplayer gaming with the removable controllers. Like I said, cutting edge console innovation from Nintendo! Come for the innovative console, stay for the myriad of both cutting edge and nostalgia-inducing first party titles from Nintendo. Not into Mario and Link games? How about the largest library of quality Indie games and old-school games? No matter how you look at it, the Switch is where it's at!

  I’ve had my Switch for about a year now and I can say it’s a very fun console. It’s no where near as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox but the fact that I can take my games on a road trip or play it at home is pretty awesome and convenient for gamers. The Joy-Cons do get loose however over time and will slide off without having to press the release button so I would recommend getting a grip or a case like the picture shown above. Another thing I wan to mention is the joy con drift, which can get really annoying at times. Having to calibrate them in the settings menu every other minute can be really annoying and for others, ruin the experience. I usually use a pro controller while playing on docked mode and I don’t run into any issues but the problem persists when I’m playing on table top or handheld. Besides the minor inconvenience here and there, I think the Nintendo Switch is great, especially with third party games like Skyrim or the Witcher 3 being ported over to the Switch. It’s a great little console.

    Pokemon came out, so I had to get it.
  
",5.0,Tim,"Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2020","









  
  
    
  I knew people who owned the Switch were seemingly all very happy with it, and I planned on getting one at some point. When Pokemon moved to the Switch, ""some point"" became ""right now"".Nintendo likes to make their consoles unique. The DS Lite had two screens, a touch screen, and a microphone that were all used to make the experience unique. The 3DS, The Wii, and Wii U also had their own interesting elements. At times, it just felt gimmicky. The Switch on the other hand, doesn't feel that way at all.It's the gaming equivalent of a laptop with a docking station. You can have the TV experience like any other console, which is also great for party games. Then you can take it with you. This is basically THE go to gaming device for plane rides. The joycons are also genius. It is just incredibly versatile.I'm pleased that it has USB C. The Dock is easy to connect to as it literally just drops in place. I do think it could use more apps. it pretty much only has Hulu and YouTube at the time of this review, if I'm remembering correctly. I am a bit of a geek so I have plenty of other devices to watch on, but if it wants to compete with some of the other devices, it would be nice to have the option of watching Netflix, for example.I remember when the Wii first came out, and you'd go play the sports games with whoever had one. The novelty wore off before long. The Switch however, is here to stay. Brilliant device

    Exceptional Portable Gaming Experience
  
",5.0,Daniel,"Reviewed in the United States June 2, 2020","









  
  
    
  This was my first hand held gaming device and I think it is a very unique, innovating what a portable console should be. I love the portability of it on the go and the ability to allow multiple players play at once. For $300 I think this is a solid gaming console that can be used to pour hundreds of hours into and still find games refreshing. The Nintendo game lineup also has the best exclusives out of the other competitors, from Mario to Zelda to Animal Crossing, there’s a game that suits anyone’s taste. Of course there are improvements to be made such as the joycons being small and sometimes uncomfortable in the even if you put it in together like a controller, it still doesn’t replace the feeling of a real full sized controller. In the future, I would just like Nintendo to make the portable screen 1080p with a 120hz refresh rate for an even better gaming experience. But overall, with its creativity and innovation still standing strong 3 years later, there isn’t much you can’t love about the Nintendo Switch.

  The original MSRP for this console is $300 USD. It’s a beautiful device but it’s not worth any more than the official value Nintendo placed on it. So, if you see listings for more than $300, don’t buy it. It’s more than likely coming from scalpers waiting to benefit off of your desperation. Consumer willpower is the only way to break the cycle these corrupted scam artists have created.

  I kept checking and FINALLY was able to find a Switch for retail. Thank you Amazon!  We have a couple games so far.  Animal Crossing New Horizons, super smash bros, and Mario Kart 8.  I love how Nintendo is more parent friendly games, you don't have to worry about the games your kids are playing on Nintendo Switch so much compared to say games on other consoles with adult ratings and such.. Love that most 2 player games can be played with one joy con, (although a second joycon is on our to buy list)  the reason being is adult hands holding half a joycon is kind of hard.  If you can grab one at retail and are in the market, i'd say go ahead and pull the trigger.  If you can't find at retail, i'd suggest just waiting it out until you can. :)

  I was quite disappointed with finding a very noticeable crack in the screen (1st picture). The description made it seem like the switch only had minor flaws (if any) like those displayed in the second picture I shared. It took a bit of maneuvering to get a shot with the minor scratches in it. These aren’t so noticeable and I don’t mind them but the crack is an eye sore and I can only hope my son isn’t upset when he opens it for his birthday next weekend...Initially, the seller didn’t provide the accessories (plug and such) and I didn’t notice this error til after they emailed me. They were very quick to realize their mistake and corrected it right away. I actually got the email the same day the accessories arrived so it was absolutely fine in my book. I just wish I hadn’t paid full retail price for an item with such a major flaw in it. It seems to power up and work just fine though.

  I want to start by getting the obvious out of the way. Scalpers = Trash, and I cannot believe with everything going on right now that Amazon is allowing them to sell at such inflated prices.  Wait for the official Amazon restocks because they charge MSRP, now onto the Switch.Love it. I cannot say that enough.  The console won't blow you away, but it will keep you entertained for hours. Whether you play in docked mode or handheld mode, they both work very well and looks very good on both screens.  The battery on this generation is much improved over the day 1 release.  The battery itself is the same size, but Nintendo put in a more efficient processor which extends the battery life.The game selection is wide and varied, if you like shooters, you can find them here. If you like platformers, look nowhere else, you have some of the greatest ever made. Not just this generation, but former generations in the Nintendo Eshop.The rundown is the Switch is a great console and worth the $299, just wait until Amazon gets it back in stock, stay far away from this worthless scalpers.Last note: Follow @FatKidAlerts on Twitter, he is always keeping up with Switch stock on Amazon, and that is how I finally got mine for MSRP.

He was very, very happy. The hubby had it up and going easily and quickly, and it went from box to play time in about 30 minutes. Be prepared to spend about $20 at start up to join Nintendo, and you get a couple packs of games, some looked retro to me. The battery life is amazing, seriously. We had a 4 hour road trip getting home after Christmas, and it held the charge the entire trip. Wow! I feel like it was a good purchase.

  This is my third switch so that I can have three Animal Crossing islands because I’m insane, also I have severe ocd - same thing I guess?, and I am absolutely in love with the AC theme. I have a different style/color for each one so I can tell the islands apart but this one is def my fave. The Switch is my console. I have played a couple of games on ps4 (Atelier games that weren’t out on Switch until more recently), but now that those games are on Switch I will get them as soon as they go on sale. I love the handheld option because I can play while my husband watches something on our tv, and I love that it can also be docked so I can see things on the big screen. I play mostly handheld. It plays smoothly with the joycons and a pro controller. You can even play with a pro controller when it’s not docked if you don’t want to/can’t use the joycons. I’m sorry about the novella. It’s just enjoyable and I recommend it.

    Embarassing Scalpers and a Letdown of a Game
  
",1.0,Natalie,"Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  It's incredibly disappointing to see nothing but overpriced third party sellers are distributing this product, and the fact that I had to sign up on several stock-tracking websites just to have a chance at owning this console is more than disheartening.To top it all off, the game itself feels like a huge downgrade compared to its predecessor, New Leaf. Not only are several quality-of-life improvements missing, but tons of content such as the Dream Suite, Happy Home Showcases, deep sea diving, and more are absent. Why is island-visiting the only option for multiplayer when multiplayer island tours existed in New Leaf? Surely not because of hardware limitations?  Villager dialogue feels empty and simple, devoid of personality aside from their preassigned type. And let's not even start on the One Island Per Switch discourse. Not only was getting ahold of this console an absolute nightmare, but having to pay $60 for a game that feels unfinished is a disgrace. We can only hope that Nintendo has plans to add content (hopefully not behind a paywall) in the future instead of relying on nostalgia to fuel sales.

    The switch is a unique console that has a lot of good ideas, but is poorly executed.
  
",4.0,Terrorgod,"Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have an loaded opinion on this console that I want to express. The Switch is flawed. As an avid gamer who usually ends up buying all the consoles (except the xbox one) and loves the hardware behind these machines, the switch was super cool when I first heard about it and saw it. I got one not to long after release once they came back to my area. Though it took awhile to save up for any games as during that point in its life, everything was expensive on it and 3rd party devs hadn't moved to it yet. Also there were no media apps on it besides hulu which somehow is still a thing, surprising. But that isn't what I want to talk about, its more how the switch feels really damn cheap.I don't mean cheap as with the plastic shell either (but that is an issue, dislike the texture a lot, and it was also damaged by strong adhesives from dbrand before), but you get a wimpy TN panel for its main built in display, in an era where amoled and ips are very obtainable for device of this size (the original psvita was oled, so it could have been possible). As the resolution is at a solid 720p, which can help balance good enough quality on the go with actual game performance, I feel like they should have opted for a nicer quality screen to have better range of colors, would have created more vivid scenes using sharper and brighter colors. Instead they chose washed out TN panels which leave a lot to be desired when comparing it to any handheld screen semi modern hand held screen with exception of DS's which also chose awful screens. (and some might argue TN for faster response time, and to that, I highly disagree with improvements to other display types, and also for the type of audience the switch aims at)Next I want to talk about the Joycons, as they are lovely little controllers that snap onto the side of the console with a satisfying click. I actually wouldn't have minded them despite being kinda awful when using them on a big screen if they worked correctly, but three years in and these things are still built to fail. There is a major design flaw in them that eventually has the analogue stick wear our and start ""drifting"", making the controller effectively useless. If these were cheap, maybe I wouldn't care as much, but they are 80$ to replace. Sure you can contact nintendo customer support and they sometimes take care of you, but this is a hassle and shouldn't even be a problem. They could have just owned up to the mistake, and redesigned the controllers at this point. ( pro controller is actually a solid design, but its more expensive then both ps4 and xbox one controllers so I dislike recommending it. I believe its the amiibo sensor that does this and that's just bad).Lastly, I kinda wanna just complain about nintendo being nintendo. But before that I want to praise them for how far they did come up to this point. There is finally 3rd party content being pushed on the Switch and thats awesome. It seems like they did listen a bit and made it much easier to get games on the Switch. Ok now onto the bad. The Switch has no utility, and I get that its a gaming console, but still its surprsing that the most mobile and potentially flexible console lacks basic OS features that things like the ps4, psvita, and even 3DS were capable of doing such as, have a variety of streaming services, a basic web browser, and customizing the layout of your home screen/having fun backgrounds. There is no personality to the switch despite it being one of the most unique consoles I have ever seen, which is quite baffling to me. Despite the console featuring bluetooth for its joycons and pro controller, you cant connect bluetooth headphones to it without a 3rd party adapter, which is a little baffling for an on the go console. The UI looks pretty ugly when put onto a big screen, just a personal gripe of mine, I really don't like it. Lastly, the game cartridges are a letdown. The reason games usually feel more expensive on the switch is because they more often then not are. This is due to the game cartridges costing more to make than blu-ray media for the other consoles. Nintendo also didn't want a disparity of cost between physical media and digital media, so if you launch a game both ways, you need to have the price be the same, which creates higher costing digital games on the switch store vs any other platform. The cost of the cartridge also varies depending on size of the game, so larger games will suffer more to this than smaller ones.That's my loaded opinion which turned more into a typed rant on the switch. Its still a pretty ok console that provides a ton of unique experiences that you can't get on any other platform. As a sole console I don't think I would recommend this unless you fully know what you are getting into, but as a side device to play exclusives its not bad. Hopefully they will release new hardware and software updates to fix many of the gripes I rambled on about.

  I bought this for my kids and they seem to enjoy it - i do like that you can play it in a portable mode and connect to a large screen tv.  The controller is rather small when splitting it to do two player so people with large hands will find it hard to use.  The orientation of the controller and how it's held varies per game and screen so that can be confusing.  Having the loop at the top of the controller on one side and on the bottom of the other, can assist with a left handed player but for right handers it can feel odd.  My biggest gripe is the motion sensors on them aren't as accurate or sensitive as a Wii controller.  But overall thus far is a fun setup.

If I read those first I would have never bought this, now I'm wondering if they bought from 3rd party sellers.So even though it said it wouldn't be in stock for another month,  I still ended up receiving this 3 weeks early.  Now the box wasn't taped like most boxes these days are so I was scared that something was missing. It was a brand new console, no scratches or scruffs. All pieces needed were there and in working order.Setting it up to the tv was a little complicated for me, which made me feel old in my 40s lol. I had ended up missing a step which extremely frustrated me as I don't recall that step being in the  instructions but I probably just didn't see it. The step I had missed was having the console in the dock while setting it up. Once I figured it out it was a cinch lol. If I had seen this step set up would have taken 2 minutes tops to set up.Very pleased with this system thus far. Will update if anything changes

The pastel colors are so cute and the texture on the back adds a great extra touch. The dock has an AC graphic on it which was a great addition tomy living room! The packaging is also well thought out leading to a great unboxing experience. Of course this works exactly like every other Nintendo switch, so this is entirely about aesthetic.With all of that said, the price gouging on this product is insane. Because it is a limited edition the reselling price is crazy, and because it does nothing a normal Switch can’t do, so purchasing this is a novelty. If you have the cash to drop go for it (I was lucky enough to get one at the normal price). But as I was hunting one down when they were first announced, I watched people buy them up and list them at inflated prices before it even came out. So maybe consider if you want to give those people your money.

I first purchased the Nintendo Switch about 2.5 years ago.  recently, there was a problem with the Switch and it stopped turning on.  I called Amazon, at which time they let me know that I surpasses my warranty on the item.  I immediately was disappointed and than immediately relieved for the next thing the Amazon representative told me was that I was going to be able to receive a $340 refund of the 399 i spent on the item.  After 30 months, if you tell me that I would receive almost a full refund after my warranty had run out... I am still in shock.Now as for the Switch itself... We love it.  It's not a Playstation 4 or Xbo 10000 or something.  But it's a great family system that also is great for when friends and relatives visit.  Recommend the Switch for every household.

It’s sad and pathetic seeing scalpers buy things in bulk just to resell at a ridiculous product just because they have more money to spend than everyone else. It’s toxic and should be illegal.I managed to buy mine at Best Buy for my girlfriend and it’s exactly what an animal crossing fan would love, aside from not including the game, which isn’t too bad because then you can decide if you want it physical for the cover art or digital without having to worry of loosing the game.I know we all want to have one right now or at least when we get animal crossing so that it feels more special when playing it but if you can wait, then wait. Voice your concerns to Nintendo and Amazon

    You Can Get The Switch For MSRP!
  
",5.0,Shari Smith,"Reviewed in the United States July 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  I ordered the Nintendo Switch for MSRP and I thought it was too good to be true, but I ordered it Thursday and it came Monday! The website I used to help me find stock was stockinformer.com. It alerts you the minute there's Switch stock and you just have to be quick enough to buy it. It may take a few times and a few clicks but I was eventually able to purchase mine and I love this thing! It's really helped me curb boredom. I hope this helps anyone and please don't buy a Switch from any of these 3rd parties jacking up the price.

    Nintendo Switch is Magnificent

  First off I want to thank Amazon for the gracious price.Magnificent machine. Plays very well. Fun fun games. As a person that plays video games on every system from PlayStation to Xbox to PC I have to say I am very impressed. Highly recommend the games are the legend of Zelda breath of the wild, Mario‘s odyssey, astral Chain, Super smash brothers.

    (New) Nintendo Switch HAC-001(-01)
  
",5.0,Sam Lilly,"Reviewed in the United States September 15, 2019","









  
  
    
  This revised model of the Switch comes with a number of features that I honestly can't fully appreciate as someone who didn't own the previous model. The big thing that drew me in was the extended battery life, even though so far I haven't played much in handheld mode and not at all in tabletop, but they use the same amount of battery either way I would imagine. The reason I'm giving this system five stars probably say more about how good it is than anything else. But I pretty much expected as much. I'm sure by now you can go online and find more detailed reviews for the gaming system, but in case you're wondering here, this one comes with the system, two gray joycons, two attachments to turn each joycon into its own controller, a base to connect both joycons into the formation of a singular controller, the required cables, and the Switch dock. So you'll probably want to buy a few things alongside this such as an SD card for reasonable storage space, a pro controller for a more standard controller experience, maybe a dock sleeve to prevent the possibility of scratching the screen from insertion and ejection of the system, an online pass if you plan to play any games with online features... just basically a lot of things that would be nice if they came with the system itself. This will inflate the price further, but the thing here is that this is going to replace the old models of the Switch and simply make this the main one manufactured now. So... basically, if you want a cheaper Switch you'll want to get a Switch Lite and this one will still cost about 300 bucks like the 2.5+ year-old original variant still costs. That is, unless you want to go used. I'm only bringing up these points because while this is a great system, I do think you should be aware of what is likely to happen with prices and availability going forward and plan accordingly. Once I realize a Switch was still going to cost the same if I wanted the ability to do on and off TV play I decided I might as well just hop on board with this newer variant. I'd recommend you do the same as it has had tweaks to make it just a slightly better version all around than the previous model. Otherwise, if price is a concern, wait for the Switch Lite and see how it tickles your fancy. Also, here's tip. If you want to turn the system off as opposed to leaving it in sleep mode, simply hold down the power button on the system for a few seconds and then a menu will appear with the option to restart or shut down. Also note that you cannot play on the TV off of the Switch's battery power. The dock needs to be plugged in for the dock to function. I hope something in here was helpful.

  I was so lucky!!! I happened to randomly check one morning after I had already given up on my search for a switch at retail price and THEY WERE IN STOCK FOR 299!! (sold by amazon) I nearly cried of happiness and immediately bought it. It took a week and a couple days to get here, there was a delay in my delivery. I was worried they had sold me a sold out switch but nope it came in! Just hold on and be patient and don’t buy from these greedy scalpers. A few things about the system itself:The stand is hard to pop out if you don’t have nails (especially if you bite your nails like me) so I bought a stand for it. The game cartridge part is a little hard to take out at first too and I thought I broke It but it’s flimsy plastic so it bends.The controllers are kinda small if you have larger hands.I would also recommend a screen protector, carrying case, and a stand (so you don’t have to keep opening the kickstand it comes with)

  Similar to other Nintendo systems, innovation is always attached to their new ideas. The joy cons are similar to the wii remotes, albeit not as precise for some games where they were used for shooting type games, the joy cons are incredible for multiplayer. I honestly prefer using one joycon whenever I can when playing games, it's really nifty being able to play two player automatically with a friend or family member without having to pay for an expensive controller, or a cheaper built one.Nintendo Apps are so-so at the moment, it would be great to have streaming apps such as Netflix for streaming, but other apps such as Youtube have worked well streaming but I do not like the interface for searching for videos.When playing online, after paying for a year subscription, was not as bad as the days of the Nintendo Wii, but it could be better. Wifi play has always been a struggle for companies and consumers that I don't expect to go away with any patch made by Nintendo. Buying the year subscription also includes many nes/snes games you can play with the joy cons in single/multiplayer. My roommate got rehooked playing super mario world and it was a blast seeing someone who says they ""hate games with bad graphics"".Overall, if you're looking for a system for on the go or for a house hold device, the Nintendo Switch is a excellent system with a good range of games to play on. My young nephew and kid siblings are a fan of it; and same for me and several of my friends who are in our early 20s.

  Don’t be discouraged by the 1⭐️ star reviews; this is the real deal! You’re only allowed one animal crossing switch per amazon account to allow most people to get their hands on it without the extreme price gouge. The switch looks beautiful while docked & i’m a fan on the pastel blue/green & cream colored contrast. If you already played AC on another switch console, you’re now able to backup & transfer all of your save data by contacting Nintendo support. It’s a little tedious but, worth it if you have 100+ hours of hard work. 10/10 recommend to those who have been trying to get their hands on this in months! (GREAT HOLIDAY OR BIRTHDAY GIFT IDEA)

  The red box tells you that this is the new model with twice the battery life. I never owned the previous model but I can tell you that I played in handheld mode mostly from 11:30 am to 4:30 pm with the exception of lunch, and I played 'til about 4 pm before I got the low battery warning. I watched a Youtube video that also showed that the colors on the screen are more accurate and the cooling system has been improved. So if you're wanting to play Witcher 3 on here, I recommend getting this one, as that power hungry game might warp the chassis from overheating. On top of that they are the same price right now, so I don't think anyone should get the old model until the price goes down.

  Seller deliberately did not state that the console was for sale and use in either Korea/Phillipines/Dubia as it turned out after calling Nintendo and giving them the ups code the one I received was meant for the Phillipines. I called the seller Wacky Jacky and told them what was written on the bottom of the box, he then told me to please wait a minute while he got another from his warehouse and proceeded to verify what I said then said he was sorry and that he had no idea and that his distributor assured him it was a US (North America) console. He then said I feel really bad and was going to send me a $100 gift card but what he did was refund $100 of the purchase price thinking that I would then keep the system. I don't know why he thought I would keep the system when I already had my return authorization label printed out and told him I was returning it, never did I say I wanted to keep the system. Am I supposed to believe he didn't know it wasn't a North America console when even now he has edited his listing to let any future buyers know that what he's selling isn't intended to be sold in the US. The seller asked me to please edit my review and rating but I see no reason to change the stars although I did edit this review to include the conversation with him and the fact that he did not add a note to his product description to make buyers aware of the consoles region. BEWARE WHEN YOU ARE BUYING A SYSTEM THAT IT MAY NOT BE INTENDED FOR SALE IN THE US..... CONTACT THE SELLER BEFORE BUYING AND HAVE THEM VERIFY WHAT IS WRITTEN ON THE BOTTOM OF THE BOX

  Here is what happened. I already had a Nintendo Switch but I didn’t play with it for a few months so when I wanted to use it it had no power. I put it on the dock to charge and nothing. I thought it was dead forever so I ordered a new one from Amazon. Later I went to see if my old Nintendo would power up after I charged it. What I was not doing is pushing in the power button enough, after I pushed the Nintendo powered up. So now I own 2 Nintendo’s. It’s great to have 2. This new NS works great just like the old one. I could care the less about the game Animal Crossing but I like how the NS looks. Also there was waiting time if I wanted the exact one I have. Over all the NS is great! In fact I like it better then Sony play Station or X-box I don’t even play them anymore. I love it I can play the old games from Nintendo and others. The first game I played was PONG back in the day.

I like that this console not only has a cute design and fun colors, but it came in a neat Animal Crossing cardboard box with every item needed for operation neatly organized.

  I couldn't believe my luck when I was able to snag one at MSRP after the release date. It's so cute! I like the design of this one much better than the other switches, and the dock is adorable, especially if you're an Animal Crossing fan. And it's the newer version with improved battery life, too! I was thinking about getting a switch for a while, but the lack of games I absolutely had to have and the colors (I'm not a big fan of the standard colors/designs) put me off. Animal Crossing solved both of these problems with ACNH and this amazing special edition.My only complaint (other than how difficult it was to get - finally caught a restock in the middle of the night and even that sold out in less than 5 minutes) is that sometimes one of the joycons gets stuck when trying to remove it from the strap. It's probably just an issue with mine in particular, but it does make it kind of annoying to remove. I have to put some force into it, and I'm sure that one of these days, I'll accidentally scratch myself trying to remove it. Otherwise, it's very cute, and at MSRP, I'd definitely choose it over the other colors!PS - I hear that this version is restocking, at least in Japan, so absolutely do not buy from scalpers! When I was hunting for this, there were at least 100 being sold by scalpers for ~$500;  now there are just over 20 for $750 each. It's cute, but it's not worth making a scalper $400+ off of other people's desperation. Just wait for a restock, or buy a regular switch and put a skin over it.

I also checked to ensure that someone with an older model Switch didn't Switch out their console withe the new one and then returned it. Needless to say, it was not the case and I did receive the new version. So far I have had zero issues, tons of games and hours of play time.

  When I was little I used to be able to spend all day playing games. Of course as I got older, my amount of free time decreased exponentially. If, like me, you need to balance your job and college life but still want to play games, this console is a really great choice. It's loaded with tons of pick-up-and-play games that are great for quick 30 minute sessions. The handheld mode makes it really accessible and portable, and the new model has a great battery life. My only big complaint is that the controllers when in handheld mode don't always feel securely attached to the sides of the console. There is a small amount of wiggle if you move the console that is not really enough to bog down the experience, but is still noticeable enough to feel sort of cheap. Overall though this is a great console for a busy young adult still trying to find time for their favorite hobby and I highly reccomend it if you're interested.

I have a gameboy advance, and still play the old pokemon games on it from time to time, but the switch is so much more than that. Its like combining all of the good things about a wii, a gameboy advance, and even an old n64, and packing it all into one box, that can even be taken on the go.I am super excited to own one, and i cant wait for more switch games to come out, BOTW, lets go eevee, Smash, the upcoming pokemon sword, and mario odyssey are my definite favorites.THOUGH THEY NEED TO FIX JOYCON DRIFT (sigh)

    Surprisingly enjoyable in handheld mode!

  The switch is already of my favorite consoles I’ve ever owned. As an adult-I’ve been surprised by how much I play it in handheld mode. It’s nice to be able to sneak in some gaming time here and there at work when there is some downtime. And I actually find myself playing it in handheld mode pretty often at home when I’m watching football on the weekends. I’m glad I waited until this model with the improved battery life came out. Sometimes, I don’t have to put it on the dock to charge for 5 or 6 days, assuming I’m playing 30 minutes here and there. I highly recommend this system.

    Great Console, however not without flaws
  
",4.0,Erin Phillips,"Reviewed in the United States February 10, 2021","









  
  
    
  After Switch's became almost non-existent at the beginning of March 2020, it is good to see they are finally back on the market. I pre-ordered my switch off amazon in January. It was supposed to arrive in March, but to my surprise and delight, it arrived a whole month early. I've been having a blast so far, but like everything, there are pros and cons to this device.I've seen some complaints from people about buying the switch on amazon. When buying it, make sure that it cost 299. If the switch alone costs more than that, you are buying from scalpers. Avoid buying switch bundles. They might seem like a good idea but they often jack up the price to get an insane profit, because you don't actually know how much it costs to make all the various extra add-ons they are supplying. Lastly, make sure it says that the seller of your switch is Amazon.com. If it comes from anyone else, you might be scammed/sold a switch that is supposed to be new but is not.PROS:- Great for people who miss the days of mobile gaming. And when I say mobile I don't mean phone games, I mean PS  Vita's, DS, etc. The switch gives you the best of both. Sometimes I plug it into the tv big screen and enjoy the beauty of it, but having the option to play in my room or in a car is or literally anywhere is a big plus for those who want to.- The Price. While in comparison to other consoles the switch is not the best in terms of technology (it's not even close), it is the cheapest. It cost 299 prior to taxes/duty. A digital PS5 is going to cost at least 399, and an Xbox is 499.- The games. While at launch it might have been a bit sparse, not anymore! There are tons of games available to play, from Nintendo classics to indie games.- Perfect for casual/busy players. If you're like me, and can't devote your whole life to gaming, the switch is the perfect device. Its cheaper price-tag and mobility make it perfect for gaming for one or two hours a day, without breaking the bank.CONS:- Joycon drift. If you buy a switch, expect your joycons to eventually stop working correctly. It hasn't happened to me yet (thankfully), but it will happen. To everyone eventually. For some reason, Nintendo won't fix this. My best bet is they know people get annoyed and just buy new ones instead of waiting for them to sort it out/replace it for free. Be prepared to fork out 80 USD if yours break.- The ""Nintendo Tax"". Expect Nintendo games to cost way more than their counterparts. Mario Cart 8, which came out on the Wii U, is still 60 dollars. Old Nintendo games that came out years ago are still selling for full price. Why? Because Nintendo knows you bought the switch just to play these games. Also, the fact that you can still buy these games on game cartridges pushes up the price.- The dock. The dock is, well, not as advanced as you might expect. It is an electrical part surrounded by a piece of plastic. I highly recommend buying a dock sleeve or a screen protector before using the dock. There have been reports of the dock scratching/ damaging screens because of the plastic scratching against the surface.- Lastly, the storage. I bought 2 games to start, Animal crossing and Mario cart. Half of my switch's internal storage is now gone. You are going to need to buy an SD card. You do need to be careful however, not all SD cards work with switches. So if you're like me and don't know how the technology works, you might just need to buy the branded SD card for switch, which is more expensive than a regular old sd card. If you are technologically advanced, I highly recommend doing some research to save moeny.

  I don’t know about you but I battled with getting the Switch for ages. I wasn’t too sure if the price of the device was worth it or not but I eventually bit the bullet and bought it and I have no regrets.I like how the device can be hooked up to your tv or you can bring it with you on the go. Right now as I get settled in a new place I’ve been bringing it with me on the go, sometimes I’m on campus and there’s nothing to do or I’m waiting in between classes so I just whip out my Switch and begin to play.It was worth it for me, I am waiting for more games to arrive for the Switch but there is a decent selection of games to choose from.

    It's Nintendo's newest generation console - you know what this is.
  
",4.0,Svartgotik,"Reviewed in the United States January 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  I'm mainly going to list off the pros for this unit, something I like that they did on this generation compared to the other consoles by Nintendo and some gripes.Portability obviously with its docking capabilities - very good move.  The way the Switch locates itself within the dock is a cool party trick.  I like not having to have a rucksack full of gear just to bring my system with.The Joy-Con controllers are passable and you can actually play 2P games with each one.  I do wish they offered a Pro-controller bundled version.The setup of the system is easy, you don't have to fill out another mortgage worth of EULAs to play.For pennies you get a slew of NES and SNES games through Nintendo Online.Mario Maker 2 is pretty fun and I wished more games had BYO levels like it(cue the wave of gamers that will correct me on 20+ games that have their own world-building options. I'm 43 and don't have time for games like I did in my teens.  Let me dip my filthy casual toe back in the game pool now that my kids are grown.)

    Nintendo's best console in a long time
  
",5.0,Keonyn,"Reviewed in the United States March 7, 2021","









  
  
    
  Sure, it's no PS4 or PS5, but it's an incredible little machine with such incredible versatility in such a tiny package. While it might not have the pure processing power and graphics capability of the other two major systems it does do what Nintendo has done best for a long time, provide a reasonably priced quality portable gaming system. The advantage this time is that the Switch is both a home console and a portable console in one unit. This is something that consoles in general have never really been able to do until now and it's amazing how great the game quality is even in this small form factor.I mean, the Wii was good in the motion control but the gimmick did wear after a bit. The WiiU really felt like a disappointment in that it just didn't bring much to the table and Nintendo clearly wasn't going to be able to compete in the home console market against the other two juggernauts. What Nintendo has always been great at though is dominating the portable gaming market and the switch sees them bringing their expertise in the portable market to the home console market in a power play that really paid off in my opinion.Now, this system does still suffer from some of Nintendo's generally less favorable business practices so do take that in to account. The price for the Switch itself actually isn't that unreasonable so I don't fault them for that whatsoever. The peripherals, on the other hand, really put a dent in the pocketbook if you need to buy anything that didn't come in the box (and you probably will need to at some point, let's be honest). The price of games also comes at a premium just as it has with past Nintendo systems as you will rarely see even older games every discounted or put on sale while such things are very common with the the competing systems. For instances, ""Zelda: Link's Awakening"", which has roughly 13 to 15 hours of content, will still cost you $60 which is incredibly high for a game that offers so little content with little replay value. Sadly Nintendo has a tendency of doing this and always has so do be prepared to pay premium prices for most games with the Switch.All in all I still think the unit is worth it particularly since you just can't find a better portable gaming platform than this. I definitely recommend getting the Switch over the Switch Lite as those are fully integrated and if you bust an analog stick or a button you're pretty much screwed. With a Switch you can replace the side controllers as you need and we all know controller buttons and analog sticks can wear over time so that alone is worth it. I mean, for $100 more you get a heck of a lot better of a system than you do with a lite so I highly recommend going this route if you're looking in to a Switch.

    Nintendo coming back to greatness
  
",5.0,Owen,"Reviewed in the United States December 2, 2019","









  
  
    
  For quite some time Nintendo has been underwhelming when it comes to hardware specs on consoles. To the point that I switched to buying only the handhelds after the Gamecube. With the jump to an Nvidia GPU, not only does the bar for graphics get bumped up significantly from what Nintendo has released recently, it also allows third-party title developers the ability to bring their fun games to Nintendo for releases.Let's state that this isn't as powerful as the PS4 or Xbox One, but still has very good graphics. Not only that, but being able to undock it and play it like a handheld is an awesome feature. Switch Online, a service needed for online gaming, also includes NES and SNES titles you can play for free (included in the price really). My ONE issue, is that chat is needed through an external app. If this is done so the playing experience online requires less bandwidth in the rooms and therefore is smoother on the servers, than it makes sense. Otherwise, seems a bit annoying to have to need another device for it.

  I love the aesthetics of the console and I appreciate that I was able to buy it at regular retail price but the storage space is terrible. I ended up buying a micro SD card because of how bad the storage space on the switches. Like so bad I was only able to store maybe five to six games before I got the SD card. That's not terrible if you're just the kind of person to play one or two games on the switch but definitely something to think about.

After an insane amount of troubleshooting, I was finally told by Nintendo that the product was defective.  Nintendo wanted me to ship it in for repairs, THE DAY AFTER I BOUGHT IT.  So instead of offering me an exchange, they want me to send in my BRAND NEW SWITCH for repairs.  Kind of ridiculous if you ask me, they should have replaced my Switch no questions asked.
