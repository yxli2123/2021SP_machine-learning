  I was very interested in taking advantage of homebrew software on my old WiiU. I tried to use a couple of microSD card with SD card adapters, but they kept failing. I decided to pick up one of these. It has worked time and time again without issue. Transfer speed using a USB 3.0 card reader (not included, obviously) was nice and fast. If you are in the marker for Wii U homebrew, pick this up immediately!

  As other reviewers have noted, the write speed of this card is horrible. I bought it to replace an older SD card and the SanDisk performed much worse! Here are the comparative benchmarks for both:* SanDisk 64GB Ultra SDXC UHS-I Memory Card - 120MB/s, C10, U1, Full HD, SD Card - SDSDUN4-064G-GN6INWarning: Only 60872 of 60874 MByte tested.Test finished without errors.Writing speed: 21.9 MByte/sReading speed: 86.9 MByte/sH2testw v1.4=========================================================* Samsung PRO UHS-I 64GB SDXC Memory Card - MB-SG64D/AMWarning: Only 61028 of 61029 MByte tested.Test finished without errors.Writing speed: 74.4 MByte/sReading speed: 85.0 MByte/sH2testw v1.4______________This may be fine for some uses, but is unsatisfactory for photo/video cameras - one of the main targets of SanDisk memory cards. My Canon 7D Mark II shoots long bursts of RAW images at 10fps and this write speed is insufficient.

  I got my SanDisc 32 Gigabyte Ultra SD Card through the mail in perfect condition, I inspected the packaging and labels to verify if I had received a ""fake"" memory card and everything was intact as well as the accuracy of the labels. The packaging was very tightly packed in with the cardboard and clamshell packaging melted together, the memory card is secured in a clamshell packaging with a plastic film that covers the would be exposed section of the clamshell packaging inside the cardboard packaging, the memory card labels, icons, and finished paint for memory card's sticker is exactly the same as the images online for the product. I had used an external USB memory card reader with 3.0 USB Ports and used the H2w_Test software to verify if the memory card has accurate memory information, storage capacity, as well as read & write speeds. The test had no errors that had ever occurred and I have exactly 29.7 Gigabytes which is what your going to get, read & write speeds were about 20 Megabytes on average for me but I'm using an external 3.0 USB SD card reader, so it""s fine.Overall, the memory card works as advertised,I'm a very happy customer!

  This supposedly is the newer model of the Sandisk Ultra series. It claims to deliver ""up to"" 120MB speeds which when compared to the previous model, it's about 20MB faster. (120MB vs 100MB not a big difference). I cant compare the two since I only have the newer model.Anyways using the benchmark application, the read speed I got was around 90MB/s. Which is great but less than advertised. Ironically though, if you look at other reviewers with ""Sandisk Extreme cards up to 170MB"", they are only getting about the same read speed as this card does. (Unless theirs are counterfeits.)In my real life testing, it took about 10 minutes to transfer a 6.5GB file from my laptop to this SD card. Compare that to my old Sandisk USB stick, this SD card is light years ahead! Another good thing about this sd card is that the performance is sustained.On the other hand, the write speed is way too slow and is not great for filming in 4K. I recommend you to spend extra on cards with faster write speeds if your planning to film 4k.Using the Lumix DSLR alongside this SD card is not a problem! Everything runs as it should, just don't expect to film in 4k as I've said, the write speeds are too slow for that.All in all, I'm somewhat satisfied with this purchase. It's cheap. Offers reliable read speed and is good enough for my purpose. Its also sold by Amazon and not by other potentially fake sellers so thats good :)

  I take a fair amount of photos, and tend to buy a replacement card of this brand about once a year when the old card gets full. They are  good quality, contain loads of images, and are  fine for video filming too. Over the years the cost of these has come down significantly, and they represent good value for money. They do the job required very well, so I am a satisfied customer

  This is a genuine SanDisk sd card and held files to its full size without file loss.It writes at about 30mbps on my PC.  The 'up to 120mbps speed' claim on the packaging is READ SPEED not write speed. This is a game all card manufacturers play on us. (To get a card with high write speeds you need to pay much more - look into the write details not the headline claimed 'speed'.)This is a great card for the price and if you just want to take photos or Full HD video it will be fine.  For 4K video or high bit-rate, 50fps FHD you should use a U3 rated card instead.

  I use these memory cards all the time in my Canon camera and find the quality and available storage perfect for my purposes as an obsessive photographer and journalist. I have only experienced a problem once with one of these disks and that was when the storage was almost full. I could not download images and it was nothing to do with the 'lock' button at the side. However, I was still able to get the images off by opening the disk and sliding the images on to my desktop.

  I do a lot of recording, mainly archival of open reel tape, vinyl and other obsolete media and I need a lot of cards.  I've been buying these Sandisk SDHC cards for a while now and I've not had any problems.  The price now for three is very good.  The Zoom H4n can only accept a card with a maximum of 32GB of space, trying a larger card will result in a card error.

  When used in Browning Recon Force 4k trail cameras, these SanDisc discs created corrupt mp4 and jpg files in up to 50% of images taken.  The same problem did not arise in the Browning when using most other makes of disc although I did have the same problem with some super-cheap discs, which these ScanDiscs are most definitely not.  However, these SanDiscs worked OK when tested in a Cannon SX71 camera and a Bushnell E3 trail camera and in general PC usage.  Am in discussion with Browning on the subject.  I hope this is helpful.Allan Bantick

  I bought 3 of these and not one worked, they was used for photographs in a DSLR camera in the camera the photos show fine, they are in the same format i have always used but I have used multiple readers on mac and windows and tried each card in every variation and they all go completely unrecognised.and by the way how on earth can you rate an SD card on warmth and sheerness? that's how you could rate clothes not a SD card that has nothing to do with warmth and that isn't see through i should have known they would be rubbish just by how the company expects you to rate a memory card like an item of clothing. I really wish you could give -star ratings

  My mouse cost more than this chip and it's working just fine. Read/Write speed isn't amazing, but it's good enough for saving data, executing CPU light programs and the usual kind of thing. Just don't run an operating system off it or anything and you'll be fine.64Gb is plenty for the time being. Especially for the price of a few cups of coffee.

  I don't know if this is a case of confusing marketing/models or fake stock, but this has poor write performance of ~27MB/s. The capacity is legitimate (not pictured).I compared it with a Sandisk Extreme, and you can see the significant difference in performance. In the future I'd stick to the Extremes.

  F√ºr UHD-Filmer und Besitzer einer Mittel- oder gar Oberklasse an Fotokamera ist diese Speicherkarte nichts. Daf√ºr ist sie zu langsam. Meine Canon 1200D stoppt ohnehin nach einer bestimmten Anzahl an Fotos zum √úbertragen der Bilder auf die Speicherkarte und mehr als FullHD als Videoformat l√∂st sie zudem auch nicht auf. Sequentiell verpasst sie zudem die n√§chste Klasse nur knapp: In meinem Test schaffte sie eine Schreibrate von 28,68MB/s. Lesend - f√ºr ein schnelles √úbertragen einer gr√∂√üeren Sammlung essentiell - immerhin 90MB/s. Das ist vorbei an der versprochenen Marke ""bis 120MB/s"", aber f√ºr eine 32GB Karte der Class 10 Zertifizierung definitiv nicht verkehrt. Sie ist damit immerhin gut doppelt so schnell lesend wie vorherig gekaufte Markenspeicherkarte und gut 40 Prozent schneller im sequentiellen Schreiben.Fazit: wem Class 10 sowie 32GB reicht, der findet hier ein sehr g√ºnstiges Markenmodell. Kaufempfehlung!

  Mi serviva una scheda SD da 32 GB per sostituire una vecchia classe 4 in un Old 3DS XL. Questa non √® eccessivamente veloce, ovviamente, ma √® perfettamente adatta all'hardware a cui l'ho destinata.Per pochi euro in pi√π avrei potuto prendere modelli decisamente pi√π performanti, ma per dispositivi senza richieste eccezionali questa va pi√π che bene.

  Schedine funzionanti a un ottimo prezzo, di solito se ne trova una sola allo stesso prezzo. Buona velocit√† e capienza, eccetto che per video ad alta risoluzione o necessit√† di foto a scatto continuo interminabili √® perfetta anche per macchine fotografiche professionali con slot SD.Aggiornamento -  Mi √® stato chiesto da un amico e quindi ho pensato possa essere utile anche ad altri: il pacco da 3 schedine √® uno solo, come da foto, non sono confezionate singolarmente e non √® inclusa alcuna custodia per le schedine, una volta aperta la confezione si hanno solo le 3 schedine sfuse.

  Compr√© esta tarjeta de memoria para una c√°mara reflex canon eos 700D, para hacer fotos y grabar v√≠deos. La compr√© porque pone que es clase 10 y tiene una velocidad de transferencia de datos decente, pero no es lo que me esperaba.La tarjeta en un principio parec√≠a que iba bien, o sea, como tiene que ir una tarjeta, sin ning√∫n problema ni que pasase nada extra√±o, teniendo en cuenta sus capacidades. La utilic√© unos d√≠as para hacer fotos y todo bien. Al pasarlas al ordenador la velocidad es decente y no hay problema en ese aspecto.El problema viene en el momento de grabar v√≠deo. La tarjeta como que se bloquea, es algo que ya me hab√≠a pasado con alguna tarjeta sd que no era de clase 10 o con velocidades de transferencia bajas, pero no con una as√≠. El caso es que graba unos segundos pero no m√°s que eso, y la grabaci√≥n se corta, con lo que para grabar video... queda inservible, al menos en mi c√°mara me pasa.Creo que para hacer fotos solamente, est√° bien, pero en mi caso no es lo que necesitaba, por ello no puedo recomendarla si es un caso similar al m√≠o.

  le schede SD le ho incominciate ad usare un 15 anni fa quando acquistai le mie fotocamere e telecamere digitali. Allora la capacit√† era ridotta ad un massimo di 2 GB mentre ora con 32 GB sono comode anche per salvare video da riversare nell'HD del computer da Digitalizzatori o altro. Il marchio poi √® sinonimo di qulit√† con un buon rapporto prezzo/Qualit√†

Sommer, Winter, Urlaub, Fernreisen, Berge, Meer, Hitze, K√§lte, Flug, Schiff, Bahn, Auto usw. und hatte noch mit keiner einzigen Probleme.

  Ich habe diesen Artikel hier bei Amazon f√ºr nur 6,99‚Ç¨ erworben. Als Prime Kunde war der Versand inklusive.Der Artikel entspricht genau meinen Anforderungen. Ich hatte ihn urspr√ºnglich gekauft, um ein Software Update f√ºr mein Navi im VW Tiguan II aufzuspielen, da Micro-SD Karten nicht unterst√ºtzt w√ºrden.Mit dieser Karte hat es auf Anhieb geklappt. Das Discovery Pro Navi meines Fahrzeugs hat es gleich erkannt und ich konnte die Software schnell und ohne Abbruch aufspielen. Auch mein MacBook hatte es zuvor sofort erkennt, sodass ich die Software schnell und zuverl√§ssig aufspielen konnte.Jetzt, wo die Software schon aufgespielt ist, nutze ich die SD-Karte um im Auto immer wieder neue Musik h√∂ren zu k√∂nnen. Die Schreib und Lesegeschwindigkeit ist absolut schnell. Alles geht ruck zuck! Schnell als auf meinem (etwas √§lteren) USB Stick.Daher kann ich diese SD Karte uneingeschr√§nkt weiterempfehlen.
