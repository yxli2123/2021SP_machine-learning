    An appalling error!
  
",1.0,Lima Bean,"Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2018","









  
  
    
  There must be many thousands of digital versions of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. I got this because I wanted to compare it with another that I had, and didn't realize until it was on my kindle that the name of the author on the cover page is  incorrect!! The author is NOT Charlotte Bronte!!!!! This is so inexplicable and appalling a mistake, I had to write and mention it so that it can (hopefully) be corrected. The rest of the text is fine. I don't want it on my kindle, and have deleted it. How anyone could have confused Jane Austen and Charlotte Bronte (author of Jane Eyre) is beyond me.

    ""Pride and Prejudice"" is one of the best sociological studies about early nineteen century British loyalty and ...
  
",5.0,Joseph Sciuto,"Reviewed in the United States February 13, 2018","









  
  
    
  After reading the first few chapters (The chapters are very short) of Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" I wondered how anyone could be interested in such pompous, egotistical, aloof and self serving characters?After reading on I said, ""Wow! How could I be so interested in such characters?""Getting toward the middle of the book, I was hoping that it would never end.By the end of the book, I fully realized what a magnificent piece of writing I had just read.""Pride and Prejudice"" is one of the best sociological studies about early nineteen century British loyalty and society I have ever read - where title, rank, fortune, and good looks are in many ways the requirements of an approved marriage, much, much more than love. In fact, this wonderful book might not be as relevant today as two hundred years ago, but there are still many traces of such societies throughout the world, today. It was not all that long ago in America, where marrying outside of your religion, or ethnicity, was looked down upon.The book is full of wonderful characters, but Elizabeth (Lizzy) Bennet is, in my opinion, the star. Her character is so wonderfully and fully realized that at times I felt her jumping off the page and directly into my life.Liza, a fellow member and friend on Goodreads, informed me that she had read the book twice and still was not sure if the ending was 'sad' or 'funny.' To me, it was funny and exceptionally rewarding but sad to think that a lady's livelihood depended more on the wealth and rank of your partner than love.Quite an amazing book.

",1.0,Krister B Swartz,"Reviewed in the United States July 14, 2019","









  
  
    
  Ssomeone apparently decided that Pride and Prejudice needed ""updating"" into gibberish (see screen shot). A few representative sentences: ""Her mind changed into much less tough to expand."" ""It is extra than I have interaction for, I guarantee you."" ""Why, my pricey, you should understand, Mrs. Long says that Netherfield is taken by using a young guy of huge fortune from the north of England."" There are many sentences just like this on every page. It's amusing for a short while, and then it's not.

    ""Pride and Prejudice"" by Jane Austen started off annoying me and ended up enchanting me
  
",4.0,Amazon Customer,"Reviewed in the United States March 5, 2016","









  
  
    
  ""Pride and Prejudice"" by Jane Austen started off annoying me and ended up enchanting me. Up until about page one hundred I found this book vexing, frivolous and down right tedious. I now count myself as a convert to the Austen cult.I must confess I have been known to express an antipathy for anything written or set before 1900. I just cannot get down with corsets, outdoor plumbing and buggy rides. Whenever someone dips a quill into an inkwell my eyes glaze over. This is a shortcoming I readily own up to but have no desire to correct. So I admit to not starting this book with the highest of hopes. I did really enjoy Ang Lee's ""Sense and Sensibility"" however and so when my friend threw the gauntlet down I dutifully picked it up.Boy did I hate him at first. To get anywhere with this book one has to immerse oneself in the realities of life and marriage in the nineteenth century. At first all this talk of entailment and manners just left me cold. I liked the language to be sure. Austen's dialogue is delightful through out but dialogue alone (no matter how delicious) does not a great novel make.A hundred pages or so in though I started to see what a shrewd eye for character this Austen woman had. Mr. Collins was the first person I marvelled at. His character springs forth fully formed as a total but somehow loveable ass. From that point on I found much to love about this book. I was so into it by the end that I was laughing at some characters, sympathizing with others and clucking my tongue at an unhappy few. In short I was completely absorbed.In conclusion I must now count myself a fan of Miss Austen's novels (and not just their fim adaptations) and do so look forward to acqauinting myself with more of her work in the future. ""Emma"" anyone?

    For those that want the Peacock Edition Paperback...
  
",3.0,roland,"Reviewed in the United States May 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  I love Pride and Prejudice. This review is not about the novel, but this specific edition. There was a beautiful, illustrated version of Pride and Prejudice published in 1894. This paperback is a poor replication of it. In all I paid about $20 for this copy. There were less than 300 copies printed of the original and can be found online for thousands of dollars. That is a pretty big financial commitment, so I started looking into replicas. I discovered this one and figured it was a nice way to dip my toes into this illustrated version. Overall, it is an okay copy. Some of the images are very pixelated, as shown in the photo. I have a screenshot of a scanned version of the original compared to what I received. The images in this paperback have far less detail than the original. There is a huge range in the quality of the images. However, this copy satisfies me enough and fulfills my wish of having this version. I wish more care was taken into the design of the front and back covers. The outside could have been truly beautiful instead of looking like a cheap knockoff.There is another publisher that does a hardcover copy of this 1894 edition that looks stunning. That one is priced at like $300 so I might upgrade to that in the future as a treat. I desperately want to get more copies of this book that are stunning. If you can afford it from the get go, I would probably go with that. If you cannot and are desperate for the peacock edition like I was, stick with this for now.

    A time capsule for an era
  
",5.0,Nerine Dorman,"Reviewed in the United States April 10, 2020","









  
  
    
  I'll admit, the thing that made this novel easier for me to figure out was that I'd watched Pride and Prejudice (2005) starring Keira Knightley. I'd put off reading the actual Jane Austen novel for most of my life. This is not my usual fare, at all, but because a good friend of mine, Helen Moffett, is seeing the release of her P&P sequel Charlotte, I figured I'd better get reading so that I could have the background.Historical fiction written during contemporary times is one thing, but actual fiction from more than hundred years ago is quite another. Austen writes for an audience that would take conventions in clothing and the environment for granted, focusing instead of dialogue and mannerisms. So we're left with a kind of shallow, limited third person that doesn't feed readers who're used to a deeper point of view. So it helps immensely for folks like me, who honestly don't have a clue, to have watched that film. It gave me useful context. Don't be ashamed to watch the film before reading the novel.I believe it does the book a disservice to evaluate it using contemporary standards. Authors these days have a deep well of literary conventions to draw from, so applying those to Austen will rob the book of much of its character. For me, P&P exists as a time capsule, offering a glimpse into particular cultural and social mores prevalent within English society at the time. We step into a world where characters are trapped by their status within society, and while it can be argued that many of Austen's characters are shallow (um, hello, Mr Collins much), I feel that Austen is taking stabs at society. And it makes me also realise how much society has changed, and what we, as women, take for granted in terms of our liberties and empowerment in contemporary times.While I didn't gain the same sort of enjoyment from Pride and Prejudice as I would from the usual titles I'll slide onto my Kindle, I nonetheless walked away from this novel feeling as if I'd gained a better understanding as to why Regency-era stories have carved themselves such a beloved niche among readers. It's easy to loathe some of the characters, and at a glance, people like Mrs Bennett seem facile and annoying, but if you dig a little deeper, the social commentary becomes crystal clear. Sure, Mrs Bennett's obsession with marrying off her daughters seems exhausting, but if you understand her very real fears that she would not be able to care for them if they never got married – for there were no prospects for a woman in those days to have a career – then it's possible to be more sympathetic towards her. Despite each character having perceived privileges, they themselves are trapped by their social standing. And don't get me started on Mr Collins, and especially his appalling commentary when one of Elizabeth's sisters elopes.It took me some time to get used to Austen's style, and now that I'm done with the novel, I also realise it's a story that begs being reread at some point. The beauty of the telling lies in what the characters have to say to each other, and how they respond to circumstances, and I feel on the first read through there were many subtleties that I may have missed.

    Story good print quality poor.
  
",4.0,C F Underwood,"Reviewed in the United States November 14, 2017","









  
  
    
  The print quality of this book was disappointing.  The headers and footers were cut much too fine with the print almost on the edges of the paper but worse was the breaks in the printed lines where a sentence would beak part of the way across the page leaving a large blank space before continuing on the line below.  All the text was there but it made for very disjointed reading spoiling the pleasure of reading this old classic.  This was a regular occurrence throughout the book.The whole point of large print books is to make reading easier for the sight impaired, this book although large print because of the poor layout and lack of attention too detail did not make for the pleasant reading experience I had looked forward too.  The story is as good as ever but this book as printed is very poor.  I've probably been generous to give it four stars and only did so because it is hard to find large print books.

  This is a lovely collection, and I made sure to grab it early because at 10,000 copies each I knew they would sell out. I appreciate that they came with a plastic jacket to protect the book, but it is very cheap cellophane and is not meant to be kept on the books. The die cuts are EXTREMELY delicate and you have to be careful when pulling them off of the shelf when they are next to each other. One die cut can grab another on a second book and rip. I wish that they had come with better quality covers, I'm definitely going to need to cover them myself. In addition, there were slight brown marks on my books, and much more browning on the inside of the dust jackets, where it appears that the die cutting machine got too hot and actually burned the paper. I've contacted several other book collector friends who confirmed that their set was the same. But for the price, they are a decent collection. I hope that when the future seasons books come out that they will address these issues.

    Quintessential Austen
  
",5.0,Reg,"Reviewed in the United States October 31, 2016","









  
  
    
  A favorite that is listened to year after year!  I was first introduced in an English Lit class in high school and I have read and reread this beautiful story at a rate of once or twice a year since.The characters are so well drawn, the follies so well orchestrated and the times captured in so much detail it almost takes your breath away.  The writing is truly beautiful and flows over the reader like the softest piece of silk.  The sentences are intricately constructed yet easily comprehensible and the meaning is not lost even though a single sentence might cover a third of a page.  Jane Austen's mastery of the English language is more remarkable today in this age of acronyms and sentence fragments than it was in her own time, I am sure.The story itself is incredibly detailed and the characters are drawn in a depth that is not commonly seen today.  Eliza Bennett understands herself incredibly well and is able to recognize when she has made a mistake and rectify it in a gracious way that does not occur today.  She is also able to repel unkind inquiries and remarks just as graciously.  What she is not so easily able to do is forgive the chance hearing of an unkind remark said in a moment of pride.  Hearing an unkind description of her appearance that is said by Mr. Darcy at a dance, she takes an instant dislike to him and from then on proceeds to be as unkind to him as her generous nature will allow.  Mr. Darcy, however, after uttering these fateful words that he does not know were overheard, begins to have an attraction to Elizabeth that he fights for months afterwards.  When he finally surrenders to his strong feelings for her, Eliza rejects him so utterly that he is shocked beyond recognition.  He sets about trying to rectify her perceptions of him and is making a sound beginning when the unthinkable occurs.  Can he overcome his pride?  Can she overcome her prejudice?Listening to an excellent narration of this classic was almost as fun as understanding the story with the help of Mrs. Martindale, my saintly English Lit teacher, all those years ago.  Rosamund Pike does a rather astounding performance.  All of the voices she creates are well done, singular, and fun to listen to.  I couldn't stop listening and enjoyed every second of it!

    Forget the setting, this is the best dialogue and character development you'll find in any era
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States April 6, 2018","









  
  
    
  I read this book as part of my concerted effort to fill in literary gaps in my reading history. And, to be honest, reading the current crop of new novels and works of non-fiction was starting to get me down. I needed a break. With few exceptions, it seems, the literary edges are all pretty sharp these days.And what a break this was. I can’t remember the last author I read that was as gifted at dialogue and character development. After every page I asked myself, “How did she do that?” The characters are nuanced, and they do grow, at least some of them, but Austen is able to maintain consistency and continuity within each character throughout the story and the abundant dialogue. Few authors of any era have accomplished that.The theater is the English landed gentry of the late 18th Century and the language, on the surface, reflects the theater, but the focus is the diverse cast of characters. She provides enough description to give the story context and realism but this is definitely a story about people and it could be people of any era. You will dislike some, laugh at the absurdity of others, and identify positively with a few. You will, however, feel them all come to life.And while it’s far from a glowing portrayal of the culture of the day it is not just a social commentary either. There is a message, but she tells a story, and, again, there aren’t many authors who have ever been able to pull that off. They usually succeed at one or the other.In the end, it was an uplifting read, not because of the storyline or the commentary, however. I’m not that interested in the culture of the British landed gentry of the 18th Century. I think I would go so far to say that I feel fortunate I was not born in the era in any class of society. It was the prose itself that was uplifting. That someone could write that effectively is really quite inspiring for a book lover.I highly recommend it.

    So much more fun, and more accessible, than a 19th century romance has any right to be
  
",5.0,Josh Mauthe,"Reviewed in the United States May 18, 2020","









  
  
    
  I haven’t read Pride and Prejudice since college, I don’t think, but what I remember is how much more I enjoyed the book than I expected to. For all of Jane Austen’s reputation as a romantic writer, what I took away from Pride and Prejudice was clever wit, barbed social observations, and a sense of fun and enjoyment that so many books don’t have. It’s a novel where almost all of the stakes are social ones, not world-changing ones (although the way 19th century England was, the two were basically interchangable); it’s a romance, yes, but not your typical story of star-crossed lovers or idealized people. No, Pride and Prejudice is the story of an intelligent girl who doesn’t quite fit into her society, but knows how to get along, and an arrogant man who hates most of the people around him – and with good reason, if we’re being honest. So many of them are shallow, or vapid, or both, that it’s hard to not dislike them as much as Darcy does.And yet, you can’t do that in 19th century England; nor can you throw yourself into society without some sense of pride and dignity…and there’s the conflict of the novel. But what I thought at the time would be some stuffy comedy of manners is legitimately funny and fun to read, with memorable characters to spare (Elizabeth’s condescending, mocking father is my favorite, even if he’s exacerbating every situation). And what’s more, this is a relationship that’s fun to watch develop. There’s no brooding men, no idealized human being that’s better than everyone; Elizabeth and Darcy bicker, and trade barbs, and judge each other, before both begin to realize their own arrogance and blindness in the situation. And what’s more, Austen writes the book in such a way that we’re caught up in it too, judging things based off of incomplete information and rumors, just like the characters in the novel.Add to that the numerous ways that Austen pokes at the rules and traditions of her society, while still living in it, and you have a book that’s so much more accessible, and so much more enjoyable, than its reputation might lead you to believe. I picked it up again worried that I had misremembered its pleasures, and instead was surprised by the fact that I might have, in fact, sold it short. What a joy to read.

  Pride and Prejudice is brilliant. Once you pick it up, you won’t put it down until you’re done. After you’re done you’ll pick it up again and start over. Just like your favorite movie, no matter how many time you read it, you can always read it just one more time. It’s one of those books that has you smiling like an idiot and there is nothing you can to stop it. I read Pride and Prejudice at 13 and I found it totally comprehendible, so by all means, give this to your middle schoolers. I found Pride and Prejudice to be a read-for-fun type of book as opposed to the we-study-this-in-class type, so don’t shy away from it because it’s older! The characters in Pride and Prejudice stand out and a entertaining to get to know, especially Darcy. Austen did a magnificent job of keeping up interesting, 3D characters and maintaining a captivating plot at the same time (lots of other books I’ve read can only seem to do one or the other).  Against what seems to be popular opinion, I don't think it starts out slow. We had a reasonable amount of time dedicated to meeting the characters, but within the first few pages a new neighbor moved into town and there was a dance. I would say grab a snack and a copy of Pride and Prejudice and prepare to be up all night!

  Well I’ve just finished my annual re-read, there’s a reason I’ve read this book soooo many times.  Not just because it’s my favourite book of all time, my ultimate read.  No, there’s another reason.  One word.  Darcy!  My ultimate book boyfriend.  He’s the one that all future book boyfriends have had to live up to, my first, my last, my everything.  The smoulder, the arrogance, the fact that he doesn’t suffer fools gladly and the fact that when you’re in with Darcy, you’re in, he’ll do anything for you.  That heart of his, he loves with so much passion.  Then we have Elizabeth Bennett, a true heroine, I love her so much, she too doesn’t take fools gladly, no one mess with her, she’s headstrong, loving, and independent to the core, she too loves with all her heart.  These two really are a match made in heaven once you get past all the stubbornness and formalities.  If I could only ever read one book, this would be it.

  I bought two different books in this Winter edition, Pride & Prejudice and Wuthering Heights. The covers are beautiful, intricate cut cover images laid over the blue binding. There's a protective plastic cover over the paper covers, and while you could remove it.. I'm not sure that I will. I'd rather keep the covers from being damaged, so your mileage may vary on that. The number of your particular book (out of 10,000 total) is on the inside of the book. Printing is beautiful and clear, the books are nicely made, and have an included ribbon bookmark attached. I buy a lot of ebooks these days. It's rare that a physical book is so beautiful that I really need to buy the physical copy, but it certainly was necessary in this case. These are stunning, keepsake hardcovers, and if you love classic literature the way that I do, they are a wonderful addition to a collection.

    The very essence of a novel -
  
",5.0,Edwin Relf,"Reviewed in the United States July 31, 2020","









  
  
    
  It is perfect.  Like other novels by Jane Austen, on the surface it is a love story.  However, do some research on the political and social history of England in the first quarter of the 19th century and this novel explodes into a huge metaphor and a discussion of the morality of attitudes an practice and decisions made in the land.With all Austen's novels metaphors abound and metaphors are contained within metaphors.  The physical landscape they travel over - directions, hills and dales, pouulations centres and country - underlie the mood and the changes in moral stanpoints in the novel.  And then there is the structure - the beginning, the middle and the end - and the coda.  It is just brilliant.The crux of the novel - the middle of the middle - is atthe 50% mark of the length of text.  For readers who know the novel this is when Elizabeth reads and comprehends Darcy's letter and pride and prejucice swap places.  Consider to spot where he hands her the letter - the lane beside the great park of the severe aunt whose being upholds the sucked in pretensions of wealth and a social order and aspiration to higher status all funded by so much a year from exploiting labour and land in the Carribbean and the East India Company's rape of the wealth of India.  So we have an alingnment outside and a change of alingnment that then furthers the rest of the story and that part where there is chaos centreed around the false Redcoat that is Whickam  and his move to the Blue coats.  Remember to what the Nation did with Redcoats and why there were Bluecoats and remember the Peninsular Wars ending with Waterloo and the ooccupation of colonies in the Americas and Australia.Ah - I shiver with how extraordinarialy apposite Austen's seemingly simple romance metaphor was making comment on the social norms and underlying faults of her time and place.

I downloaded this one on my Kindle because I have lent out or given away my other copies and my friends are reading it again. The same wonderful writing, but this Kindle edition is a disgrace! It appears that someone had it on a disc and downloaded it without even looking at it and left it to arrange itself willy nilly on the pages. Many, many words that perhaps were divided at the end of a line are now appearing in the middle of the line. They contain a hyphen in the middle of words that never would be hyphenated in that place. Many pages are only half pages for no reason, plus this must be a completely different book from the ones mentioned with all the wonderful pictures, because there is nothing like that in my copy. This is a book which I ordinarily love and it is ruined by all the weird things done to it on every page. My editor mind keeps screaming for a blue pencil instead of enjoying the dry humor and precise sentences of the story.

  I'm ashamed to admit it but I started and stopped Pride and Prejudice at least four or five times before this final (successful) attempt.I saw the movie in theaters when it first came out and loved it from the first (it is still one of my favorite movies) but I couldn't for the life of me get into the book.Classics are hard for me to stick with but after struggling through Withering Heights I figured there was no better time to attempt it and I was right.The wit, the magic, the grandeur of Austen are more than I imagined. Mr. Bennett and Elizabeth frequently had me laughing with their dry witticisms.I love the language and the lightness, the verbal sparring, the balls, the decadence. More importantly I love the themes present throughout the book. Forgiveness. Familial love. Secrets bringing misfortune. Snap judgements.I loved this book so much. It's exactly the kind of wholesome content I needed.

    Simply the best edition for the price
  
",5.0,DrGeorge,"Reviewed in the United States August 3, 2019","









  
  
    
  Jane Austen's best known classic requires no editorial comment; I am reviewing the edition itself.  My own company, Devon Book Printing, makes custom hard cover gift editions in luxury bindings, especially leather.  I am not comparing this mass produced edition against custom-made.  That would be unfair.  But as a commercial high-volume publisher,Everyman's Library editions are superb, reasonably priced hard cover reprints of classic works, like Pride and Prejudice.  The books are small enough to be comfortable in the hand (unlike those over-sized 'collectible' editions, which are too heavy to hold for long); the editing and introductions are superb; the page layout is excellent; the font is readable; the paper and print quality is fine for the price.  Like most commercial printers, the Everyman's tends to skimp a bit on the gutter margin and the quality of the binding, but for the money, this is a good reading copy and highly recommended.

    Everything I had hoped for, and much more!!
  
",5.0,N. Kaplan,"Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2020","









  
  
    
  Although I never had read a book by Jane Austen, I have seen every movie made based on her books, every biographical and historical film about her and the times in which she lived; and I had read three biographies of her life. As much as I had admired her accomplishments and respected the manner in which she lived, I couldn't find the patience nor summon the concentration to read her books.  Then, along came Amazon and the ability to read classic literature on my Kindle. With ""Pride and Prejudice"" at my fingertips, I gave myself to the already much loved story of Elizabeth Bennet, her family, and Mr. Darcy.  Although the intricacies of Austen's writing tired my mind at times, her beautifully descriptive language, dynamic interactions among her marvelous characters, knowledge of the human heart, and sympathetic humor for the ridiculous side of social mores kept me going until there was no way I could put the book down.  Reading this novel was like being a confidante to Elizabeth and Jane, and I found myself rooting for their happiness even though I already knew the outcomes of their situations.At this time, I find myself in the company of millions of other Austen fans who count Elizabeth Bennet among their favorite female protagonists.  Not many people are as willing or able as she to see their own faults even more clearly than those of others. The conceit and pride which prompted her prejudice against Darcy was, in time, recognized, reviewed, and corrected without any knowledge or expectations of her efforts by him. Through his acquaintance with her, Darcy also was able to transform his pride and unfair prejudices, thus becoming more approachable, humble, modest, and open to the world.  Though seeming opposite in character and disposition when they met, both characters were willing to change and grow, thereby not only finding each other's love and respect, but mine as well!!

  This is, as virtually everyone knows, a classic for the ages; but this Penguin edition has some excellent notes that bring the writing to life. One I remember offhand is a description of how, in England of the time, the cultivation of a garden was a moral undertaking -- that is, your garden should reflect a respect for the randomness of nature as well as provide beauty. Other excellent notes described how these folks ate -- nothing until 10, then a huge breakfast, then dinner in the late afternoon, and after music and games, supper. Also, the book is written and spelled as Austen spelled, so for example, ""choose"" is spelt ""chuse"" (and spelled is spelled spelt). Not everyone will be charmed by this, but it brought the much-loved and oft-read book to life for me in a new way.

    A romance that sugarcoats nothing
  
",5.0,Felicia J,"Reviewed in the United States July 4, 2016","









  
  
    
  ""It is a trope universally acknowledged that a romantic hero and heroine who loathe each other will eventually fall passionately in love.""Hundreds of romance novels penned since Pride and Prejudice feature a sparring couple who fall in love despite a strong initial dislike of one another. However, I've never read one that used this trope as wonderfully as Jane Austen's masterwork.I came to Pride and Prejudice relatively spoiler free, and although it did not engage my emotions like Sense and Sensibility did, and it started out slowly for me, I was soon enthralled by Austen's characters, their witty observations and the story of prejudiced Elizabeth Bennett and proud Mr. Darcy.Austen had an unerring eye for human foibles, and her writing about them is so spot on I wanted to stand up and cheer.""For what do we live, but to make sport for our neighbors, and laugh at them in our turn?""""We all love to instruct, though we can teach only what is not worth knowing.""""Elizabeth found that nothing was beneath this great lady's attention, which could furnish her with an occasion of dictating to others.""""Marriage ... was the only provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and however uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative from want.""I enjoy the occasional fluffy romance as much as anyone, but the real strength of Pride and Prejudice was Austen's refusal to sugarcoat. She laid bare the hypocrisies of her society and the obstacles it put in the path of individual happiness - especially the happiness of women.Her clear-eyed realism made me believe wholeheartedly in Elizabeth and Darcy's romance across all barriers of class and understanding.Kate Reading was a pleasant reader with the ability to distinguish characters with slight variations of pitch and tone and a knack for playing up the novel's most sardonic moments.

  I purchased the audio version for less than $1.00, you get what you pay for. The audio is poor quality and the narrator sounds like a beginner.

  It is an infrequent occasion I have to be grateful for my naïveté and previous ignorance; having delayed ANY consumption of the work of Jane Austen into halfway through my third decade of life is such an occasion for gratitude.The flowery prose and subject matter of the work as a “romantic” novel would have blinded me to the deeper subtlety and context of the novel, had I approached it earlier in my life.Jane Austen is an author I had written off and I’m happily humbled to have enjoyed this work the way I did.

  I am collecting all of Jane Austen's novel in these clothbound editions. They are beautiful editions, each a different color with a beautiful imprinted design on each book. Unfortunately, each one has had a code label on the back of each book. When the label is pulled off, it pulls off part of the imprinted design. Such a shame, to sell these editions with this condition. I know I am not the only customer who had this problem, just look at the reviews. I would venture to say all the Penguin Clothbound editions are like this. It is a shame the vendor feels that they can sell these editions, that have been ruined as collector books, by someone placing these damaging labels on them . There should be a disclaimer.

  I think this is the fourth time I’ve read this and it was the first time I wanted to give it 5 stars. I think the audio book was a huge factor. It felt almost luxurious to have the story read to me. But it still hasn’t moved up in my ranking of Austen stories (right in the middle).This is such a fun cast of characters. Yes, the Darcy and Lizzie romance is well-done, but it isn’t my favorite. The sisterly bond between Jane and Lizzie is perfection. Their love for each other jumps off the page. And the relationship between Jane and Bingley gets me in the feels. I feel so bad for Jane-probably because she’s so nice.It took me so long to finish this because I wanted to savor it. I’ll definitely be listening to this again.

  I’m not a big fan of the classics, per se, and I don’t typically read Victorian romance novels. But I’ve watched the 2005 movie with Keira Knightly many times, and finally decided to read the book. I’m glad I did. The movie follows the book quite closely, so you don’t need to read the book to get the “real” plot. Apart from all the cultural differences between then and now, the book highlighted for me the evolution of the language of books, of simple storytelling literature. I don’t think “write for a 7th grader” was a rule back then, and Austin’s language is refreshing. She uses “every body” and “some thing” too much for my taste, but her typical dialog almost seems written for the screen, providing clear insight to the conflicting thoughts and feelings of the characters. And her first chapter really is a study in how to write a beginning that sets the stage and grabs the reader.

The story was fine, and I got a chuckle out of some of the characters and situations, but overall, the story did not move me. I struggled with her style and the language of her day with which she wrote, AND I'M AN ENGLISH TEACHER! I can only imagine how difficult it would have been for my students had I ever taught this.

  The Chiltern Classic Edition has an absolutely beautiful cover, silver edges, and is a dainty size. However, the paper quality is really strange -- very glossy and shiny, pretty much like a textbook or children's picture book in terms of thickness and shine. It took me by surprise, as it is definitely not the ""feel"" of what I would expect from a classic novel. Additionally, there are some strange editorial discrepancies -- Jane is referred to as Miss Bennett in some places where it doesn't make sense, some strange variations in spelling of words such as ""chuse"" vs ""choose"" in some other places which is strange inconsistency. Overall, an OK and pretty book to have in a collection, but not perfect. A little disappointing for the price.

  Go back and read or reread a classic such as Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen to appreciate and experience superb writing as a reader.  Elizabeth and Darcy shows us how people from different backgrounds and social standings exhibit their own reasoned out pride and prejudice toward each other, the social and cultural classes that divide them.  Each stands their ground until, over time, they get closer to the middle in accepting and understanding the social world they live in, thereby; allowing them to blend together with true love, and not forever set them apart. Beautiful, feisty, and a most enjoyable read.  Quotable lines, I wish I could put to permanent memory.

But by the time Mr. Darcy was becoming obviously interesting, I did thoroughly enjoy the story. My rating is just personal taste as it was difficult to get used to the way it was written, understandably. It was written a very long time ago. But I actually really liked Darcy and Elizabeth and so wanted more in depth attractions because of the romances I'm used to.

",4.0,Micaiah Keough,"Reviewed in the United States July 18, 2014","Pride and Prejudice
By: Jane Austen
Rating: 4 stars
Ages: 13 and up

I adore the movie inspired by this book, Pride and Prejudice. Jane Austen created fascinating, wonderful characters that I adore. Pride and Prejudice has been a long-time classic loved by generations of girls like myself. What makes this story so fascinating? The enthralling romance. Tons of dialogue. Incredibly real-in-their-decisions characters - Pride and Prejudice is undoubtedly fun. I found myself anticipating the wonderful conclusion, smiling and laughing at some of Mr. Collin's rediculousness, and really wanting to watch the movie. :)

Pride and Prejudice is quite fascinating. The story moved along easily and (if you read over a hundred pages in one day, like I did), moved quickly. The story was dynamic, sweet, and interesting.

Characters:

Elizabeth Bennet (main character) was vivacious, to say the least. She was bold and showed it quite often. She's reasonable, and her actions and sentiments were very understandable. A great heroine.

Fitzwilliam Darcy ('hero' of the story) was such a different kind of male character than what I see in books today. At first, he seems proud and self-centered, and he looks down at others for inferiority of birth, lack of wealth, etc. But underneath is such a loveable character. The true Mr. Darcy finally comes out in the last third of the story, leaving you smiling. He changed so much from the first page he entered the story to the last.

Mr. Whickam (most villanious character) is eventually proven to be a blackguardly fellow, but doesn't appear to be so. He was more dimensional than most villians are created to be. Really, though, I didn't like him.

Mr. Collins (Elizabeth's cousin) was so much more annoying in the movie! In the book he was actually a tall young man. (In the movie he is short, has a nail-on-chalkboard voice, and isn't very handsome.) An interesting character who added to the plot and was memorable.

Mrs. Bennet - a most irritating and disturbing character. The only important thing in her life is to see her daughters married well-off - that is practically her only focus at all. Terrily rude, nervous, and so changing in attitude. The poor girls who had her as a mother!

Lydia Bennet (Elizabeth's youngest sister) was most bothersome and...annoying. Most annoying. Really, she was a cringe-worthy character.

Overall:

I enjoyed the book, but not as much as the movie. I am very glad I read it. I would recommend it to classical literature readers.

Also, two of the quotes I like from Pride and Prejudice are:

""A lady's imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love to matrimony in a moment."" (Mr. Darcy)

""Laugh as much as you choose, but you will not laugh me out of my opinion.""",

  After reading Austen’s Emma, and seeing all the rave reviews of Pride and Prejudice, I expected to be blown away by this novel. I was not. To me, this novel is mediocre at best. It is a novel, that for the most part, has a whole lot of nothing happening up until about a little over halfway through it. While it does a superb job of showing the customs and mindsets of the time period, for me, it did not do much of anything else to draw me in. The plot can be summarized as Elizabeth going, “I hate him,” with Mr Darcy thinking, “I love her,” then go back and forth a bunch of times. In all honesty the book never becomes entertaining until Wickham as a character begins to develop and show his attitude towards the world. Now, I would be lying if I did not admit that eventually I was cheering for the relationship of Darcy and Elizabeth, but I did not find myself doing that until much further into the plot, and that is why I give  this read a three out of five review. It is ok.

  I had to read Pride and Prejudice for my college English class. It was good. A little hard to grasp at first because I went into it knowing nothing of the book. Towards the end it was easier to read. If you have to read it for school do yourself a favor and find the BBC adaptation to watch along with it. It really hones in on the personalities of the characters. They also use many direct quotes from the book, which is always good.

    Classic romantic comedy...
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States September 22, 2014","









  
  
    
  Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"", first published in 1813, is considered her best novel. It continues to be a fertile source of material for television and film adaptations. It is the classic romantic comedy, even if the setting is Regency-era England.""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a good wife."" So begins the story, as the five eligible young Bennet daughters and their scheming mother learn of the arrival in their small English village of a wealthy young man and his wealthy friends. A village dance provides the opportunity to meet the newcomers. Elizabeth Bennet, the spirited and headstrong second sister, meets and immediately dislikes the haughty Mr. Darcy. Her dislike will prompt a scathing response to a surprise marriage proposal.Fate, however, keeps throwing the two young people together.

  I primarily use the Audiobook of the novel, although Jane Austen’s written work, which I have in paperback and ebook,  is unparalleled in richness and beauty. Rosalind Pike’s, the narrator, has an extraordinary ability to sound like the characters.  How she manages to sound like the fastidious Dr. Collins one minute, the condescending Lady Catherine de Bourgh or the childish Mrs. Bennett not to mention all the others,  is beyond me! I listen to the audiobook over and over to relax. It’s a great romantic story.

    ""Pride and Prejudice"" Winchester Austen Edition is a physical delight.
  
",5.0,Miz Dee,"Reviewed in the United States January 19, 2013","









  
  
    
  This is not a review of the novel itself, (which is wonderful) but of the Winchester Austen Edition (henceforth WAE) of Pride and Prejudice, published by Word Press in 2007. After buying a copy of WAE ""Emma"" in Costco, I knew I had to have ""Pride & Prejudice"" in WAE as well.  Here's why:-The WAE versions of Jane Austen's books are hardcover and physically comfortable in that they are printed on smooth white paper rather than typical beige rough paper and the typeface is solid roman type that is easy on the eyes.-The size is approximately 5X8. The corners of the pages are rounded giving it a soft look.  The covers of all WAE, are  completely black, except for the title and author and  also have rounded corners.  Attached to the back cover is an elastic band that  goes around the height of the book and you can use this as a book mark or as a way to keep your book closed.-Each WAE novel has colorful inside covers depicting a scene from the novel and there are nice color drawings included in the introduction.-Each novel has at least three sets of notes written by Austen scholars.  Most of the notes are the same in all the novels, but each novel has one additional note section peculiar to that novel.  The notes that all editions have are a timeline in color of Jane Austen's world and a color map of Austen's England. In P&P the additional notes is the illustrated Army in Austen's time.I bought used copies of WAE novels because even used, they are sturdy and comfortable.  I am very hard on books by intention.  I read while I eat, before I sleep,  while waiting on lines, etc. But mainly, I like to embellish my books with beads, ribbons and lace, and even some rubber stamping on the white spaces in the text itself.  I wouldn't have the heart to do that to an expensive hardcover.If you like the ""feel"" of books, I highly recommend the Winchester Austen Edition of any of Austen's novels.  Let me know what you think.

  I'm not sure who made the decision to make the paperback font an alarmingly small size, but why?You could have made it a normal size and then the book could have had a normal page count instead of being the thickness of a children's chapter book. The cover design also isn't fantastic, but I'd be fine with that if I could read the book without squinting. I'm returning it.

  I discovered Austen late in life; this is my sixth time through P&P and  she never fails to delight and illuminate. What a guide for living, P&P shows us that self pride is an easy addiction and that first impressions are especially dangerous.  Of course Lizzy is herself an addiction; wit and charm, sarcasm and subborness. While she and Darcy may be destined to marry, their happiness is not, without the work they must first put in. If you have not read P&P in years let yourself have the next dance.

",5.0,JudMc,"Reviewed in the United States February 19, 2016","









  
  
    
  This story is absolutely superb, truly the definitive romance novel. The only negative, for modern readers, is that, being written over 200 years ago, the language is somewhat flowery and antiquated. But for those willing to read Pride and Prejudice, they will find Jane Austen to be a truly wonderful author. Her wit is subtle, but sharp as a razor. Virtually every modern romance novel and movie has roots in Pride and Prejudice.Pride and Prejudice is the most widely read novel in the English language for a very good reason: Jane Austen simply knocked it out of the park.If you don't want to read the book, or love the book and want to see a good movie adaptation:The absolute best adaptation is the 1995 BBC miniseries starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle.A good, but abbreviated, adaptation is the 2005 movie starring Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen.

  First off I love Jane Austen. Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite novels of all time. The three stars is for Oxford World's Classics' edition.-The introduction reads like a high school student's final. There is a lot of info with no point made.-The appendices are good and I am sure would be helpful to anyone less familiar with the social conventions of the time.-I could not stand the explanatory notes. This may be a personal preference though. When novels use words or phrases that are now obsolete I like nice, succinct footnotes so I can glance down get the meaning and move on. If there are notes about how a certain line /might/ be referencing something from literally two hundred years ago or how a line was different in the novel's second print, they can be thrown in the back. In this edition archaic words/ phrases are numbered along with little factoid lines and all the information is thrown in the back which means flipping back and forth and searching whenever a little number note pops up. It keeps the reader from immersing fully (well this reader anyway).

  I have always wondered about Pride and Prejudice, and if all the praises I heard were true. I was told that Mr. Darcy was charming, but I found out that he was a proud man. And quite annoying. To many Elizabeth Bennet was the role model of women, but I discovered that she was prejudiced, even when she might be right.But at the end this was a really interesting tale. There was no one moment when I wanted to quit it, because I needed to know how things would develop. There were some surprises on the journey, and by the end I really enjoyed the story.Expectations that weren't fulfill: so.... I thought Elizabeth was a bookworm.... I didn't see her but pick up one book. Mary was more of the reader.The romance was totally lacking. I thought I would see more of it than the last 3% of the book. But I do understand why people praise Pride and Prejudice as a masterpiece of its time.

  I liked the story, BUT, it was very difficult to get through it.  I have to pride myself that I actually got through the whole book even though it took more than a month to read.  It was so wordy!  So descriptive! and the English language that Jane Austin used was most difficult to understand at times because she kept rambling on and on and on and on about anything and everything.  I had to read it very slowly.  If this is a true account of 18th century times, I'm so glad I don't live in an egotistical world as those where only title and rank in society and how much money you make as a person and as a family is the only thing that matters.  I have to admit that there were times when I had to chuckle at the ridiculousness of the events and conversations that were taking place.  I especially enjoyed Mr. Bennett's banter with his silly, willy, wife.  I have also bought Sense and Sensibility but I'm not sure I'm going to read it, at least not for a long while.

  Who doesn't at least like Pride & Prejudice? It is delightful. I consider the pairing of Lizzie and Mr. Darcy an intriguing story. The first time I read it (about 50 times ago) I had no idea what the story could be. To say there is no sexual content, is to say there is nothing like we of the 21st century are accustomed to in that regard.This book tends toward finer feelings at a time when marriage was more a financial issue than one of the heart. Lizzie's mother is cognizant of the necessity to marry her five daughters to men who will be able to support them, because the girls' small incomes will not adequately pay their way through life. Lizzie, however, does not see how she could bear marrying just for sustenance. She and her elder sister Jane discuss these issues in their daily conversations. They are of marrying age, but who among their acquaintance would be a good husband? A change to their dreary routine comes in the form of a young gentleman who lets a nearby lodge. Suddenly, life's events become less predictable and more exciting.

    Classic Story of 19th Century British Courtship
  
",5.0,"Marjie, Mother of 9Top Contributor: Cooking","Reviewed in the United States September 16, 2014","









  
  
    
  Jane Austen wrote great stories which were commentaries on society at that time, and this is no exception.  It's the story of an aristocratic family in England in the 1800s trying to marry off 5 daughters.  This is the story with Mr. Darcy in it (he's been in a lot of movies in the past couple of years).  Despite having been written nearly 200 years ago, it still feels witty and entertaining.  I actually have physical copies of this book, but I love it so much that I wanted it on my Kindle so I can read it while traveling, if the mood moves me.This edition is different, in that it contains commentaries.  Some are informative, such as the notation that since Mr. Darcy had an extensive library at home, this is proof that he was quite wealthy.  Some are just humorous, like the notation after the initial description of Darcy to the effect of ,""yes, sounds like Colin Firth."" or the footnoted comment that from Darcy's introduction to disliked character took a bit over 500 words.  Sometimes these comments were distracting, but they were informative and sometimes entertaining, and might have been helpful to a first time reader who isn't a longtime fan of early 1800s literature.

This one from Amazon services simply reads like a bad translation and I can't believe that it actually has lots of five-star reviews.  Also, I'm angry with Amazon for only showing me this edition on my Kindle which was far more expensive than the other editions (Penguin's was 59 cents and others were free).

  ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife.""That's probably one of the most famous opening sentences of a novel, along with Moby Dick. Pride and Prejudice is also probably one of Jane Austen's most famous novels. I certainly liked it much more than Northanger Abbey. It is the story of Elizabeth Bennet, who lives with five sisters, and an odd pair of parents at Longbourn. Her mother is constantly scheming about marrying off her daughters to wealthy young men, so when Netherfield Park is let to the rich Mr. Bingley, she is very excited indeed. (Mr. Bennet's estate will be entailed away from the immediate family upon his death, so at least one of the sisters has to marry well to provide for them.) And Mr. Bingley brings his very proud friend, Mr. Darcy. The book is about the courtships, and, of course, has many twists and turns. Mr. Darcy, Mr. Bingley, Mr. Wickham, and I suppose, the detestable Mr. Collins (who the estate will be entailed to) are the main men of the story.I really loved this one; it had humor and wit in it, and great characters. I enjoyed Mr. Bennet and his sarcasm very much, though Mrs. Bennet and Lydia are really too silly sometimes. So stupid. And of course, Elizabeth. She is really a very smart and spirited young woman, who will not be ordered around. I also watched the 1995 TV series from BBC, and I must confess, Mr. Darcy...never mind.Anyway, all the characters were well portrayed, and while the TV series is wonderful, it doesn't quite have the subtlety of the conversations in Pride and Prejudice itself. The TV series did have excellent casting though; all the Bennets, Mr. Darcy, and Mr. Collins were portrayed very well. (Yes, I suppose this is sort of a double review.) I would say though, that Caroline Bingley should have been a little prettier; she was just hideous, and Mr. Bingley was kind of silly-looking. But everywhere else, they did very well.Back to the book. As I said, there were many twists and turns which made this one a thoroughly enjoyable read. And really great characters. Though she is certainly less descriptive and florid than Dickens, Austen still manages in this one, to portray everyone extremely well. Mr. Collins really is detestable, Bingley overly-cheerful and positive, and Darcy stiff and stern (though he has his reasons, of course.) Mrs. Bennet is an extremely foolish woman, as is Lydia, the youngest Bennet. The pride and prejudice of the story refer, I believe, to Mr. Darcy's pride and Elizabeth's prejudice (though it is certainly debatable.) Mr. Darcy is very proud indeed at the beginning of the story, and Elizabeth's prejudice prevents her from seeing his true character for a while.I will just add that I read the Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition from 2009, and while it has a very nice design, it does not have any analysis or introduction, so if you want that you'd be better off reading the Penguin Classics regular edition or Oxford World Classics. However, my Penguin Classics Deluxe edition arrived slightly damaged on the spine, which was a disappointment.[...]

    Will Elizabeth ever get married? What about her four sisters?
  
",4.0,Tom Kell,"Reviewed in the United States September 5, 2015","









  
  
    
  It's a classic, of course. Everyone should read it. Austen is wry, a keen observer. The story is a bit cliched by now, but then it was written in the late 1700's. Girl thinks rich guy is stuck up, doesn't like him. But, toward the end of a long story, things change. Interesting view of social norms in the late 18th century. Still interesting and surprisingly easy to read today, the story has been made into movies and TV specials. Mr. and Mrs. Bennett live in a community in rural England not far (but a good long ride by horse or carriage then) from London. They have five daughters. Since he has no son, Mr. Bennett's estate will go to a distant male cousin when he dies. The daughters must find husbands or they will be destitute. Those are the curious conditions of English law at the time, and they set up the story. We thus understand the importance of having an eligible bachelor with a substantial income and property to dinner, of who he dances with at a ""ball,"" a social event at a gracious, private home in the community or a nearby one. So it's not an action-packed adventure story, but it's not necessarily just for girls. It is written by a woman who tells us the story through the eyes of the Bennett's second daughter, Elizabeth. Both are clever, independent-thinking women with keen eyes for social nuance and little tolerance for hypocrisy and foolishness. Elizabeth is such a good observer and so independent and outspoken, you'll think she'll never get married in the society Austin describes. The story's been around now for more than 200 years, but I'm still not going to tell you how it comes out.

  I decided to reread this classic because I wanted to read PD James' new novel which continues the story of Darcy and Elizabeth after their marriage when there is a murder. I wondered if I would enjoy this book after reading it some decades ago and seeing at least one movie version of it. To my delight, I found the rereading fun. The statement that a classic is a classic because people enjoy reading it is true. The book is filled with humor and witty social comments. Jane Austen pocks fun at the generally uneducated women of her age, their silliness, their interest in looking beautiful, men, marriage, and family, the strong difference between them and the men in their lives, and how some very intelligent women, such as Elizabeth Bennet, stand out despite not being as beautiful as her sisters, and accomplishing more than them. This was a time when a woman walking three miles was unusual and women reading non-fiction was extraordinary. The story focuses on Elizabeth and on Darcy's pride. He is very good looking, rich, more intelligent than most of the people he encounters, and sees their foolish behavior and thoughts as a waste of time and absurd. His first impression of Elizabeth is negative. Looking only at her surface, he sees a young woman who is not as beautiful as others at a party. As a result, he makes a remark that Elizabeth overhears, that disparages her. Later, he sees the beauty of her character and intelligence. But Elizabeth has become blind to his worth because of the prejudice created by his remark, and she avoids him. The story becomes even more interesting when other characters are introduced and we read about the five Bennet girls and their parents' reactions to them. Some seem good or bad at first, but are they, and why do they seem like they do?

  Pride and Prejudice is Jane Austen's most popular novel and it is remarkable that it has sustained such a high popularity 200 years after it was originally published. The primary plot of the story follows Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy in a highly contentious courtship that begins with mutual contempt but evolves quite unexpectedly for both into very different feelings. Subplots involve her sister Jane and Mr. Bingley in a courtship of their own as well as the romantic entanglements of various other sisters and friends. The story is a bit of a roller coaster ride with soaring hopes and crushing disappointment in store as events unfold. I won't reveal the ending for the handful of people who haven't read it but suffice to say that the novel concludes in a way that leaves the vast majority of readers well satisfied.Darcy and Elizabeth are complex and multi-layered characters who both grow and change somewhat as the book progresses. They are the heart and soul of the book and about as well fleshed out as any characters you are likely to see. The supporting characters, however, are considerably less deep and are more caricatures than anything else. Some are good and kind like Jane and Mr. Bingley, and others are ridiculous and vain like Mrs. Bennet but none are remotely as substantial as Darcy and Elizabeth. So, does this ruin the book? Hardly. These secondary characters offer a wealth of material for the author as she plays them off of Darcy and Elizabeth.This novel is almost certainly the one where Austen best displays her sharp-edged wit both through Elizabeth's dialogue and in the narrative voice describing some of these characters and their actions. If some of them were less ridiculous, the potential for the satire would be weakened considerably. And make no mistake, Pride and Prejudice is as much a satire of the time it was written, as it is a romantic drama. Even today, the prose is quite funny and enjoyable.As much as I love Pride & Prejudice, I must admit that some of the words are now archaic and some of the references have become obscure due to the passage of time.

  I have a physical version of Pride and Prejudice, but I often take my kindle with me to work to read at lunch so I bought a kindle version since I love this book and read it at least once a year. There is so much information on it that I won't review the content here, except to say read it at least once in your life. Now for the kindle version itself...It is poorly formatted and edited. If this is your first reading of Pride and Prejudice, borrow a physical version from the library or a friend or buy a copy. For me, since I've read it many times, I'm not completely sorry I have the kindle version since I can have it at my fingertips anywhere, but if editing errors and poor formatting annoy you, don't download this version.

  It’s not surprising that a girl recommended this to me and insisted that while I wouldn’t find my ‘book boyfriend’ in Mr Darcy, I’d still love it… love it, I’m not sure about that but it was enjoyable.Jane Austen’s portrayal of middle/upper class society at that time in England was interesting and stirred nostalgic feelings of a time long past, however, Elizabeth’s mordant personality and clashes with Mr. Darcy remind you that nothing much has changed between the relationship between men and women! Mr. Bennett’s character sustained me through the overwhelming female overtones, God knows how he endured Mrs Bennett.It probably is a bit girly for me, I’d prefer Dickens for that Victorian period, but not a total waste of time.

",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States January 5, 2010","









  
  
    
  I admit I'm one of those bibliophiles who collects the different editions of favorite titles, and I could not resist this cover by artist Ruben Toledo. The book itself is a classic, and timeless in its appeal. Jane Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a well-written satire on the hypocrisies of Regency society as exposed through her various well-delineated characters. Mrs. Bennet is eager to marry off her five daughters - the beautiful and quiet Jane, the strong-willed Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and flighty Lydia. So when a young man of means moves into neighboring Netherfield Park, Mrs. Bennet is determined that one of her daughters should snag the gentleman in question, Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet's character is truly a caricature and an almost scathing portrayal of the society of the time - mothers desperate to see their daughters married off, especially given the Bennets' predicament - with no male heir, the family home and fortune would be entailed away from the Bennets' in the event of Mr. Bennet's death.It is also a harsh criticism of the hypocrisy and pride of the ruling classes as well-embodied in the character of Fitzwilliam Darcy, whose pride makes him look down upon the Bennets and the rest of society not equal to his own station, though of course he doesn't count upon his own traitorous feelings when he falls for Elizabeth Bennet (whose prejudice against Darcy almost blinds her to the flaws in another). The lively and almost fiery exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy are one of the most interesting and captivating aspects of the novel. There are a host of other characters that make this novel an engrossing read - the haughty Lady Catherine de Bourgh who is hell-bent on marrying off her sickly daughter to Darcy, the comical and 'greasy' Mr. Collins who reveals his own mercenary tendencies despite being a man of the cloth, the morally bankrupt Mr. Wickham, and many others. It is a delightful tale of the battle between the social classes, and a wonderful character study. Though the language takes some getting used to (it can appear quite stilted to those unused to reading this style of writing - the flowery, stuffy sort), the story itself is compelling enough to make it a worthwhile read. In fact, having fallen in love with the novel about two decades ago, I've since re-read it countless times!As for this particular cover by Ruben Toledo, I have to say it makes for a fun interpretation of the dynamics between Elizabeth and Darcy, the novel's two main characters. Illustrated in black and white with the characters presented in silhoutte, this is a fun and inspired take on the classic which will extend this novel's appeal to a younger generation of readers. This is a novel to be savored time and again - highly recommended!

    PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen
  
",4.0,JDD,"Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2009","









  
  
    
  It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension. No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far.

  Pride and Prejudice is an amazing book! It is a classic that everyone needs to read. The writing, in Austen's words, is ""light, bright, and sparkling,"" and she could not be more correct! The characters are complex, multifaceted, and well developed.  Her proper English style is something that you cannot find in today's conventional novels, and it is a lovely refresher. You feel like you are reading a sophisticated piece of classic literature without the burdens of heavy writing. You are invited to dissect and discover the plot as much as you with, but even from the surface it is a great book for anyone, from teenagers to seniors.

  Prior to reading Pride and Prejudice, I had seen excerpts designed to paint Jane Austen's writing as stuffy, obtuse, and generally boring. One joke says that Ms. Austen's novels are like active mysteries that engage the reader in trying to find the hidden verb in each sentence. But these criticisms are not only unfair, they're entirely inaccurate: just a few pages into Pride and Prejudice, Austen's writing style ceased being an obstacle to my enjoyment and began being a central part thereof. The manner in which she builds sentences and paragraphs is pure a delight to the modern reader, even 200 years after the fact.Austen's true accomplishment here is that she makes a novel in which ""so little"" happens, by modern standards at least, so darn interesting! As one critic put it, this is a 367-page story in which the central events are a man changing his manners and a lady changing her mind. But oh how the web of intrigue is weaved! The subtleties of character development and plot construction are never forced and always as natural as they are glorious. This truly is a literary triumph, and the first great novel that places women and their happiness at the center; that focuses on dialog and feelings more than swordplay and seafaring. Its interlocking characters are so rich and well-defined, unlike anything in the preceding novels on

  's reading list. And even though the story ends up exactly as you know it will from Page 1, it's still all so satisfying!Is the book pretentious? Elitist? Maybe. But consider it a study of a particular class of people during a particular point in history. That's what it is. The heroine, with whom I agree with the author when she described her to be ""as delightful a creature as ever appeared in print,"" is bucking social conventions, but she can only do so much. She can't emancipate Woman in one fell swoop, nor is that her motivation. But Elizabeth's actions and this novel in general were one small step for Woman, at least, and an incredibly enjoyable read if nothing else. Five stars all the way!

  The manuscript for Jane Austen's best novel, originally titled First Impressions, was rejected and returned to the author. After some revisions, the novel was published as Pride and Prejudice. It has remained one of english literature's most popular novels.  Pride and Prejudice did have its share of critics, perhaps one of the most notable of those critics was Charlotte Bronte, author of Jane Eyre, who called Austen's novel a disappointment. I wager many people would heartily disagree.Even people who have never read Pride and Prejudice have heard the names Elizabeth Bennet and Mr Darcy. The main protagonists of the novel have become trademarks of the British Regency era. In the novel, Lizzy and Mr Darcy appear to be the epitome of opposites. Upon their first encounter, Elizabeth Bennet believes herself perfectly aquainted with Mr Darcy's character and hopes she will never find herself in his miserable presence again. The phrase ""don't judge a book by its cover"" aptly applies to Mr Darcy.Pride and Prejudice is one of the finest novels I have ever read. I love it not only for the romance (which is unparalleled), but also for its humor. The televised adaptations of this novel, some dating back to 1940, are excellent. The BBC version starring Colin Firth, and the 2005 movie starring Keira Knightley are amazing.  I don't think I could pick a favorite if my life depended on it. If I had to be stranded on an island with just one book, it would be Pride and Prejudice. If I could dream a fictional character to life, it would be Mr Darcy. Pride and Prejudice, an unforgettable book filled with unforgettable characters.

  Hey -- it's Jane Austen!  If you don't know the worth of her writing, 200 years later, then get into it.  Even as society, morals, mores, standards change, there are some human dynamics and types that are the same as they've ever been. Satire here is subtle and fabulous, amusing and painful, and her characters are drawn so realistically that there's no way you won't discover some of their characteristics in people you'll get to know in life. THere's also historical value -- girls and young women will thank their lucky stars to NOT be living in such a restricted, low-opportunity time as the Bennet sisters lived, and will, upon thought or because somebody will tell them, appreciate how Austen herself rose above all that and gave us the huge and beautiful gift of her mind and creativity -- and hard work.  Read Austen -- the best-selling fiction of two centuries (so far), for excellent reason.

  This is the unabridged 1945 Hardcover (cloth) Book Club edition - which means it's just as great as it should be, since it IS Pride & Prejudice, but also that the book club-iness makes it not as valuable as it looks.  This version has full page colored pictures of the characters through-out, and has that traditional deckled edge (uneven cut pages - makes it easier to turn pages imho).The book is a cute love-story about Elizabeth Bennett and Fitzwilliam Darcy set in that classic early 1800's English period where manners and one's dictated social existence means far more than independence and general happiness.  You HAVE to take into the account the current society of the time period / location to understand the predicaments.  The story is witty, albeit wordy but still very enjoyable even after ~200+ years.THIS is the version I was looking for, hard cover, ancient looking and good quality!  Perfect for my personal PHYSICAL library!  I have the Kindle version and yes, that comes with a huge amount of spelling errors and paragraphs broken up mid-sentence.  BUT the Kindle edition is FREE a good deal of the time so you end up getting what you paid for... ;)

",5.0,C. Ebeling,"Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2001","









  
  
    
  As much as I would like to, I don't reread books as a rule, even the most favorite, because life is short and there are a billion books to go before we sleep.  I do make an exception for PRIDE AND PREJUDICE however.  It is a masterpiece, a guiltless entertainment.  There are lots of laughs, some melodrama and romance which make it easy to knock back, like chocolate or a good wine.  There is, of course, much more to it, which makes it more than an indulgence.  Austen gets so much right:  she sets up a entire world and explains exactly how it works, what happens when it tips to its own excesses or when its players break its rules.  You could pitch a hardball at her window and it would bounce off, shattering nothing, that's how strong and clear it is.  She gets romantic love right, as well as all the mistakes everyone makes trying to get it right.  She spears bad behavior and holds it up on a stick.  She is very witty but never casual.  She burns up the page with truth-about her society, family interactions, human nature and the fact that no matter how civilized we become, we as a species are still at square one when it comes to managing the heart.  I see that some younger readers don't appreciate the depths this novel or its relevance for contemporary life:  maybe it's the way it is being (not) taught, but it could also be that readers have to be ready to appreciate the idea of an insular world that can bear timeless truths, and for younger adolescents, the world as yet has no edges but truth is limited to immediate circumstances.

    EMMA is my favorite of Jane Austen's novels
  
",4.0,iluvcats,"Reviewed in the United States October 24, 2017","









  
  
    
  EMMA is my favorite of Jane Austen's novels, but I love this one too. It teaches the importance of looking beneath the surface. Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy both mistake the other for being worse than they truly are because they were too quick to judge each other. Both of them judge others either better or worse than they truly are based on surface relationships. And of course, the absolute ludicrous behaviors of certain characters makes this book hilarious in a cringe-worthy way.

    Jane Austen's work of literary excellence.
  
",4.0,BDH,"Reviewed in the United States January 11, 2001","









  
  
    
  I recently bought ""Pride and Prejudice"" for my daughter. She didn't want to read it, so I did. As I dug right into it, I realized that my daughter, being only ten years old, was probably still a little young for it anyway. In fact, it was tough enough for me...Well, at least I can admit it.It amazes me that some books, such as this one written almost 200 years ago, are filled with such style and prose. It seems that in our modern day world, with our stereos, TV's, computers and toys, that many of us unfortunately, don't seem to have the time to broaden our vocabulary, and grammatical abilities as well as some did 200 years ago. I guess,.. in some ways, we have certainly regressed in the natural progression of our intellects. Interesting ... It does make you want to read more books that were written long ago,..and broaden your mind a tad.This was an interesting book, although a little slow at times; probably because of the huge gap in our cultural differences. I can see why it could possibly be considered a bit out of sync with the world of today. The book displayed what now would be considered an imbedded chauvinistic society's way of thinking; young women sitting around all day with the most important thing on their minds being, ""Who's going to come courting me today?"" But, I don't think that was any of Jane Austen's fault.All in all, it was a very well organized and written story of life and mannerisms of old British Regency.

  It's one of the drawbacks of ebooks: Turning pages, feeling paper, touching cover and binding. These are missing. This is why I enjoyed this copy of Pride & Prejudice more than I expected. I wanted to have a copy of the master, Jane Austen, on my Kindle and didn't think much for the  added watercolor illustrations until I started reading. They were graphical reminders of the attire, furniture and decorations of the Regency Period of Great Britain. The pictures added depth to an already- enjoyable story.

  *happy sigh. I mean, really, do I need to say much more than that? I can't quite put my finger on what it is about Pride and Prejudice's happily ever after that goes above and beyond your average HEA. It could be because it has quite a few of my favorite plot devices in it. Austen certainly balances them all very well. At no point does one seem to outweigh the other. In one novel you have: a grievous assumption of character, manipulative sisters, a scandalous elopement, a dysfunctional yet mostly lovable family and the heroine who marries up.I think my favorite story arc is the same as everyone else. I love watching Elizabeth Bennet get smacked upside the head by love. I adore Darcy for not being aggressive in trying to win over Elizabeth. Instead he showed her who he could be. In one instance he wasn't guaranteed Elizabeth would ever know about his act of kindness. In fact he didn't want anyone to know. Their love story is both epic and legendary.I'll admit it took some time to understand the dialogue. Once I did, I found one of the greatest love stories ever written.

  The book is so multifaceted. Relationships were started and stopped for outside reasons.  Love was found in unsuspecting ways. When it was written that Darcy was in the middle of being in love before he realized the start, that's how true love happens. People start out as friends and somehow somewhere down the road they realize they have fallen in love. Darcy bailed out a family from woes because of his love for Elizabeth.  Watch the movie with Keira Knightly as Elizabeth. If that doesn't make you want to read the book,sorry.

  My absolute favorite of all of Austen's books. Because, aren't all women looking for their own Mr. Darcy? A man who displays confidence and intelligence, but is till in want of a woman to make him gentler? And Elizabeth is the perfect lively match for serious Darcy. The sisterly affection between Jane and Elizabeth is just so quaint and sweet...and steadfast. Mrs. Bennett is the perfect example of a busy body mother without much refinement who is worried about the fate of her three daughters. She brings many a groan with her brash words and emotional outbursts, but still manages to bring a smile to your face when you understand how much she loves her children and truly wants the best for them.A lovely story about misconceptions, miscommunication and a happy ending all wrapped into one. You will get lost in the beautifully woven story of life, love and family.

  What more can one say about the contributions Austen contributed to the development of the novel.  Internal thoughts, giving rise to stream of consciousness  writing;  multiple characters sustained througout the novel;  plot development instead of letter exchnages. On the simplest level the story is so richly written that even after the surprises are over on the first reading, one wants to return to enjoy the characters.  This is true as evidenced by the continuing stream of spin offs in movies and novels.  Elizabeth Bennett would run for president if she were alive and real.

  This is a classic, a favorite among my family and peers and a story that never gets old.  In a time when being proper was taught, and social standing was what you were born into somehow true love sometimes prevails.  Jane Austen, although never married, can write with the soul of a true romantic. She uses wit and twists on what was considered ""normal"" in her time period and made a masterpiece that lives on through the ages.  This is a love story about a girl named Elizabeth Bennet, who lives in a less than grand social stature with her sisters, her father, and her outspoken mother.  She is witty, lovable and in a word headstrong. Although she does not realize it, the love of her life, Mr. Darcy is fighting with his own sense of propriety and moral guidelines to put a halt to the love he feels for this young woman.  Engaging, with characters you love and in some cases cannot help but love to hate bring together a truly remarkable novel that will be  hard to put down,

    Not Worth the Hype
  
",3.0,Heather Berg,"Reviewed in the United States April 23, 2015","









  
  
    
  Jane Austen’s Pride and Prejudice is a classic novel based in the early nineteenth century that focuses on many issues at the time such as women’s roles in society and society’s unattainable standards in general. So basically, if you like petticoats and large words nobody has heard since 1832, you’ll love reading this novel in your parent’s basement with your cat as you dream of a dashing young man with a British accent whisk you away on in his horse-drawn carriage.  I’m kidding. Well, partially any way. Many high school students are assigned to read Pride and Prejudice, and the outdated language along with the early nineteenth century setting are usually a big turn off to us young-ins. Quite frankly, we’d rather watch Keira Knightley and Matthew Macfadyen make out in the 2005 movie version. The story begins with Mrs. Bennet talking to her husband about potentially marrying off one of her daughters to a man she hasn’t even met yet. Ultimately, her goal is to marry off all five of her daughters (you would think she would have at least popped out one boy- yeesh.) to wealthy men who she doesn’t know. What a good mother. Actually, this was a typical mother’s desire of her young daughters during this time period, and ironically, Mrs. Bennet would probably been seen as a “good mother” in society’s eyes. Young women were expected to marry off to wealthy men of a high social class because obviously they couldn’t possibly take care of themselves. Oh, and if you’re poor and on the low end of the social class scale, looks like you’re screwed for life because a man with a high social class would never be seen with the likes of you! What would people say and think? After lots of meddling by the one and only Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Bingly finds himself to be quite fond of Jane, one of the five daughters. However, (as I described previously) Mr. Bingly was pretty high in terms of social class, and Jane was a bit lower than him. But don’t worry, he eventually comes to his senses and realizes that happiness is more important than what other people think. You won’t see that coming, I promise. Likewise, Miss Elizabeth Bennet’s beauty has caught the eye of handsome, wealthy, arrogant Mr. Darcy. But it won’t be until she rejects him multiple times that he starts to take notice in her. Eventually, after two marriage proposal rejections, Lizzy consents and they fall in love. They give society the big middle finger and choose happiness over standards. You won’t see that one coming either. As for the other three daughters, Lydia, Kitty, and Marry, well, their story isn’t so happily ever after- depending on how you look at it I guess. Lydia ends up marrying some rude soldier guy who turns out to be poor too. He actually married her because he thought he’d get a sweet deal out of it. Too bad she was poorer than him. They live the rest of their lives in unhappiness because they don’t actually love each other. Kitty and Marry don’t end up getting married. Perhaps they too were waiting for their night in gold-plated shining armor just like every other young woman in the early 1800’s. What they didn’t realize is that marrying someone purely for the sake of marrying them wouldn’t make them happy either, and until they realized that, they would forever be unhappy. In all honesty, I think Pride and Prejudice has a bad rap within my generation. Maybe it’s the language, or maybe it’s the setting that we just can’t get past, but I think if we really push through the surface, we would find out that Jane Austen was a pretty bad ass lady for writing this during her time, and that maybe it’s not just all about big words and petticoats. I give this novel three out of five stars. Not just because the characters are easy to make fun of, and therefore amusing to read, but mainly because Austen fearlessly published a book about how awful society’s standards were not only for women, but everyone. You go girl. But I’d still recommend the 2005 movie version- it’s way faster and the words aren’t as big.

  I love Jane Austen's writings. She uses words and sentence structure that are not familiar to me in my everyday life. On my kindle download of the book I can quickly look up the meanings of words I don't know. After all, the first edition was in 1813 and she was in England. The story goes forward fast enough to keep me interested and it easily takes me to another place and time by her descriptive phrases. So far in reading, I've found nothing that would make me blush or put the book aside.The book itself is average paperback quality. I bought it for my daughter's English class, so it did not have to be of high wear quality. It's what I expected in a paperback. The chapters are in Roman numerals. I find that interesting. There is about an inch of or inch and a half at the bottom where she can write her study notes. There is spacing between the chapters but the new chapters do start on the same page as the previous chapters.I like the story and the layout of the book.  I like the price of this Dover Thrift Edition.

  A friend of mine knew that I was working my way through the classics that I didn't read in school, and got me a copy of P&P for Christmas.  Personnally I think this is one of the best works Jane Austen came out with!  It took a couple of pages for me to adjust to the antique english, but once I did, I loved immersing myself in a culture long gone.  Once or twice I even caused my husband's brows to raise when I accidentally answered him in Olde English!  Austen gives just enough detail (thankfully not enough to bore you), allows her main characters to be fallible, and whisks you off into a tale that is wonderfully wrapped up at the very end.  None of that here's-the-last-page-sorry-you-still-have-questions nonsense (fine for a series, but definately not a stand-alone)!  If you too are looking for an extremely well-written, entertaining classic with a happy ending, don't let all the collegiate level stuff scare you!  Give yourself a chance to get used to the old phrases, and give P&P a chance!A.L. TravisAuthor of The Pillar of Light: The Legends of Milana Series[..]

  Classic and must read for everyone!  Jane Austen is one of my favorites.  The stories are long and slow, but Jane has such a good style of writing.  I don't like to write too much in book reviews because I feel that in order to adequately write a review, I would have to give away information that would be key to plot. I don't like to be the person to give away spoilers. Therefore my book reviews are always very short and only say a few things in order to tell you, book reviews are much to subjective and I never read a book review before I read a book. I read a book based on what the book is about which I don't read a review to get. If you want more information, buy the book and read it. :)

  This with good cause is the most popular and well-beloved novel written by a clever and insightful author. Each character is well defined and developed without resorting to stereotyping. Indeed they are so believable they seem to walk off the pages and into one's living room. One thing I treasure about this author is her insight into human nature and the gentle irony with which she treats the foibles and idiosyncrasies of her characters. She is sympathetic with her characters, treating even the most undeserving cad in a way that hopes for improvement. It is also a pleasure to retreat from the coarse language and dark outlook that plagues so many novels into pages where language is skillfully manipulated to express the full range of human emotion and experience. It takes a bit of effort to fall into the language of this era-a new reader would be well advised to procure and watch the excellent video created by PBS.

  As I find with most ""classics"" this novel took some time to completely capture my interest. Once it did, however, I was completely enchanted. Our 21st century need for speed and immediate gratification takes a backseat as we move with Jane Austen through the every day lives and loves of her characters. The slow but steady pace of the novel allows the time to actually get to know and connect with the characters. Austen brings you fully into her world of 19th century England: with no difficulty you can feel the joys and sorrows, happiness and tribulations of the Bennet sisters and especially Elizabeth and Jane.Classic themes: scheming mothers, class distinctions, vanity, pride,false assumptions and misunderstandings abound...until by the novel's conclusion I could not help but find myself rooting for Elizabeth and Darcy.I thoroughly recommend this to anyone who loves classics and doesn't mind the slow pace that generally characterizes them.

It turns out that I just didn't like to be forced to read horribly dull books only to have to write an essay or take a test on it later.  After I hit my twenties, I decided to give reading a second try with this book.  It is truly a page turner, even reading it for the 3rd time.  The characters are relatable and lovable.  Austen also doesn't bore with impertinent details.  I absolutely recommend this book, even if you think you hate to read.

  It is, to put it simply, unequalled.  Not many books come as close to perfection as this one does.  Flawless prose, crackling wit, good drama, fully developed characters and a perfect plotline make this the best novel in the English language.  You may argue with me if you wish, there is no other book that satisfies like this one.  Jane Austen was a woman for all time and she was a genius in every sense of the word.  She understood people.  We are blessed to have with us this remarkable work.  How did she pull it all off so beautifully?I do not write much because I think that you, dear reader, should get your hands on this one pronto and stop reading this brief, rather trite review that does not come anywhere close to revealing Ms. Austen's creativity.  I have returned to Longbourne, Netherfield and Pemberley several times in my life and will continue to do so.  If I have the good fortune to meet Ms. Austen in the after-life, I hope that she will give me an autograph.  Or at the very least, give me a nod in my direction.

  I read this at the same time I was watching the PBS series.  It was remarkable how exact the dialogue was in the movie version.  It was stimulating to read the descriptions and beautiful use of the English language.

  I first read pride and prejudice in high school by necessity, and I just didn't get what all the fuss was about. I thought it was hopelessly dull, thought the characters'actions and beliefs were archaic and not relatable, and I definitely skimmed most of the second half of the book.This experience couldn't have been more different! I finally understood and appreciated the subtle sense of humor with which Jane Austen writes, and I actually found myself laughing out loud often. The relationships between the characters were so clear and so entertaining that I found myself wishing for certain conversations to occur just so I could hear more. Far from stuffy and inane their concerns were human and emotional. So glad I read this again!

  Unfortunately, I watched the movie first. I had a hard time shaking those impressions in order to form my own honest ones for the first several chapters. I could see nothing but the actors' faces and the glorious set of the most recent and popular Hollywood rendition of this story. I felt cheated of the joy that imagination gives; that can only be got at by reading. I was anxious that the rapture I had felt (and still do) over the movie all those years ago could not be superseded this time by the book. This was unfounded, thankfully. I have a feeling I will be back to visit these characters frequently by book just as surely as I have had the pleasure of their company by movie.

   The book came wrapped up, protected with bubbles, and in a box instead of an envelope, so they appear to have corrected the shipping issues that were mentioned in previous reviews. However, mine came printed completely backwards. To read it, I have to hold the book upside down. It's still Pride and Prejudice, so I'm still going to keep it. But if it had been a gift, I would have been very disappointed. I'm looking forward to reading it in public so I can make people wonder about the crazy lady reading a book upside down.

  I had seen and loved the movie, so I finally got around to reading the book. This is the free Kindle version, so I'm not 100% sure it's completely original. The text was very annoying, it seemed like there was a capitilized word at least three times per page. I didn't think it was necessary as the readers can tell when emphasis is being placed on a certain word without being in caps. The annoying text did not alter the fact that this is an excellent book. It's a wonderful look back in history and the characters are charming and likable. I just love the love between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy, one of the all time classic loves. I'm glad I finally got around to reading this. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys historical period books or great love stories.

  The BBC movie (1995) of Pride & Prejudice follows this book real close.  I loved the book but, of course, I love the BBC series a lot better because it put actual images in your mind and gave you an idea what Mr. Darcy (oh my God) looked like and Lizzy and all the other characters.  I cannot imagine having lived during that time.  There are quite of other books out that can be bought on Amazon pertaining to Mr. Darcy and Lizzy. Also, one book 'Return to Longbourn' is after Mr. Bennett dies and what happens.  I have read some and everytime I do the image of Mr. Darcy (Colin Firth) and Lizzy (Jennifer Ehle) comes to mind.  I am sure that just about everyone has read Pride & Prejudice. Loved it.

    Austen's Classic is Truly Timeless
  
",5.0,Kindle Customer,"Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2004","









  
  
    
  Jane Austen obviously chose the titles to her novels with care, for this book truly is about pride and prejudice, explored through the eyes of the book's main character: Elizabeth Bennett, as well as the rest of the Bennett family, Elizabeth's best friend Charlotte and the upper crust families with which they rub shoulders.Set in the England of King George III, ""Pride"" details Elizabeth's coming of age and her exploration of her own romantic nature. As the second eldest of five daughters, and most beloved of her father, Elizabeth is used to being the quickest wit around, and fancies herself an expert of human nature. When Elizabeth finds herself sought after by several men, consecutively, she finds perhaps she isn't quite the expert she'd believed herself to be.Austen is a master of character study, and ""Pride"" is certainly no exception, being the finest example of her work. While a romance novel in earnest, Austen never hesitates to ruffles feathers with her quick wit.Characters such as Lady Catherine de Bourgh, Mr. Collins, and Lucas family and, of course, all the Bingleys, provide an excellent assortment of personalities and conflict that Elizabeth must navigate in order to remain true to her nature and find her position in English society of the time.Herself the daughter of a clergyman, Austen was no stranger to the lifestyle of which she wrote, and ""Pride"" provides excellent insight into her time.

  I have read this book more than one hundred times from age eleven until my present age of seventy years. I never tire of it. The interpersonal dynamics depicted by Austen are timeless and brilliantly perceptive. Society has its claims upon us all, no matter how trying. This satire has helped me survive the many unpleasant but necessary associations which are required by simply being a human being. Sadly, I have come to the conclusion that I , in my dotage , resemble Mrs Bennett far more than I would care to admit. Fortunately, I also feel akin to Mr Bennett, so my life has not been a total loss. It's wonderful to have such a book in one's life. Amusement is to be had for readers of all ages.

I didn't think that the book would be able to much surprise me. But, my goodness, this book is one of the most delightful, compellingly readable pieces of fiction I have ever found. And, oddly enough, knowing the story through the movies made the surprises that the book has to offer all the more valuable.The language Austen uses is fantastic. The book is charming and very funny. The characters are all fully developed and funny, from the annoying Mrs. Bennet to the startling, judgmental Mr. Collins. And the romance is wonderful.Elizabeth Bennet and Fitzwilliam Darcy are great characters, and I'm glad to finally be acquainted with them in their original form.

    A Timeless Tale
  
",5.0,Foster Corbin,"Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2004","









  
  
    
  A mother's driving force is getting her five daughters married quickly; it hardly matters to whom. A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the chagrin of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is wealthy. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married.  Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. I recently reread this comedy of manners that I hadn't read since high school. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married. Even though we in the U. S. have lived through the 60's and the ""Women's Movement,"" sixty percent of law students now are women, and many things have changed about the way young women are brought up and what they do with their lives, I still saw a lot of families I know here. Everything changes; yet everything remains the same.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are quite wonderful in what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than ""venison"" or ""meat."" While people often ""color"" when they blush, the only color named in the entire novel is blue; Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play. We do know that Elizabeth plays rather badly. I kept thinking that these young girls have too much free time on their hands. They need more hobbies or part-time jobs. Of course young women of a certain station in Austin's day didn't work. The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."" With that great opener, we are off and running.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own.

",5.0,Mike C,"Reviewed in the United States October 9, 2014","









  
  
    
  Among the most famous love stories ever written, second only to Romeo and Juliet, this classic piece of english literature earns every accoclade it has.  Jane Austen's scathing wit keeps virtually every scene interesting and the dialogue between the characters, especially the two leads, stand as her finest writing achievement in her illustrious, if sadly brief, career.The book is in many ways a critique of both the qualities of the landed gentry and their shortcomings.  Austen recognizes all the virtues of gentlemanly conduct, civility towards neighbors, and still manages to level scathing criticisms of at the mercenary character of some individuals and the vanity of others.This book is remembered as a classic love story, and I would argue one of the key reasons is that as the two lead characters are developed, alongside their relationship, they both become better people.  Darcy's interaction with Elizabeth awaken a more civil manner in his treatment of people with lower social connections, while Elizabeth sheds some of her own prejudices as she learns more about Darcy's generous nature.  The civility of both is improved.It is, in my mind, the 'Casablanca' of classic literature.  I have found many classics to be difficult to read, but Pride and Prejudice was engaging, both for its excellent characters, intriguing stroy, and especially, its social critiques.

  Pride and Prejudice has long been my favorite, and most read, book, so I am completely familiar with the text.  I consider it to be the greatest romance ever written and Jane Austen's wry sense of humor shines.With the caveat that I haven't heard other audio versions of P&P, I thought that Josephine Bailey did a creditable job of reading this classic.  Her male voices were less than convincing but P&P mostly has female dialog and those voices were fine.  Her narrative voice, flow, and pace were excellent.A technical note:  This Tantor eBook CD includes an MP3 version of the audio book as well as the entire text in Adobe PDF format, so that one can follow the text while listening.  It totals about 628 MB in size, nearly all of which is the MP3 audio book.  However, the written PDF text on my disc includes a duplicate of Chapter 33, listed as ""Chapter 34"".  After that, the remaining chapters are off by one number.  Nevertheless, the entire written text is present and this flaw is not found in the MP3 audio book, where the chapters are entirely correct.Because of this technical mistake in the PDF text, I gave this eBook only four stars.  But for an enjoyable audio version of Jane Austen's masterpiece, this disc is a fine purchase.I'd like to put in a plug for what I consider the best screen adaptation of Pride and Prejudice, the 1996 BBC/A&E version:

  This is a good ebook version of Austen's ""Pride and Prejudice"". I am surprised it doesn't have more reviews by now. It includes an introduction by John Bailey and the Hugh Thomson illustrations.Hugh Thomson's work is elegant and sharp and befitting the style of Austen's work. Especially in Pride and Prejudice. When the novel is more somber, his choice of scenes can get a bit awkward. But for some reason I do not understand, kindle Austen ebooks contain illustrations by Brock. Now, I am not one to speak of taste, though in truth I do not like the Brock ones, but the amount of illustrated editions and the sparsity of Hugh Thomson ones was alarming.Why bother? When I looked into it I was a new owner of a kindle paperwhite. P&P is one of my favourite books and my favourite reading copy the one by Collector's Library. A small hardcover with the illustrations by Hugh Thomson... I wanted a kindle copy that would smooth out the difference. It turned out quite a difficult task... Till I found this one...!For anyone interested, there are currently two more options. The one by Defoe and Poe and the one by Dover. When I made the purchase, there were only this one and the one by Defoe and Poe. The other one did not include all the scenes. This one does! I do wish they looked sharper on my kindle paperwhite... They look a bit vague. But at least there are all of them here...And the one by Dover? Well, the kindle version was not available then. But I already own the Dover 1894 facsimile hardback... Wonderful! The cover is unassuming, it's a pity they didn't go for the 1894 cover, but within? Simply gorgeous!Ok, info time. The first Hugh Thomson edition of Pride and Prejudice was published in 1894. It included line drawings of scenes of the book. But it also had several small... em... decorating details throughout. Like the headings in every chapter and the illustrated version of the first letter of every chapter. (that is going to be awkward in ebook!). The standard, when an edition claims to have the Hugh Thomson illustrations, is to include only the scenes but ALL the scenes. Dover makes the exception of publishing the 1894 facsimile, which means everything...! Still a little bit bulky for a reading copy. But beautiful within...That's it. Happy choosing! And do not forget Pride and Prejudice itself! Elegant yet sharp, light yet socially ironic, don't miss it!

  The book was a great read- I hardly put it down for the 4 days I spent reading it.  It does differ from the movie in that Mr. Darcy really was haughty and prideful in the beginning instead of merely misunderstood, and Elizabeth Bennett was prejudiced, but both of course reconciled and became better people for each others' accusations.  Also, there were a couple additional characters and some of the dialogue was switched between characters, which made more sense than even in the more recent version of the film.  There was one notation at the closing of every (mailed) letter that I did not understand, but otherwise did not see many mistakes that would not have been in the original manuscript as other reviews reported.  I thoroughly enjoyed the book.

  I'm slightly embarrassed to say that it took me this long to get around to reading Pride & Prejudice. I don't like romance novels and I'm generally wary of anything that is too popular. And yet here I am, giving P&P one of the few 5-star ratings I've ever bestowed. Jane Austen is, without a doubt, among the wittiest, cleverest, most talented authors I've ever read. I laughed out loud repeatedly, thoroughly enjoyed many of the characters (the protagonists were refreshingly frank and the stupid ones were delightfully annoying), and don't you tell anyone but I had tears in my eyes when Darcy and Elizabeth finally sorted things out. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time, and I imagine that I'll be delving into Austen's other books in short order.

  I just finished reading the book about half an hour ago. I read it in almost two weeks, since the complexity of my life's schedule did not let me finish it in less time. Let me assure you that it is a good title, and I look forward to reading more on Jane Austen. I enjoyed the reading so much in my Kindle that one day was reading at the University, waiting for some Registration assistance, and I began laughing on the occurrences of Lady de Bourgh at Longbourn.I gave this title a 4 star review since some formatting problems on the Kindle edition; including capital letters where there was no need, word and line spacing, and not coming with a list of the Chapters to be read.Although I found these errors sometimes annoying, I enjoyed quite much the experience of reading this ebook, since I never thought I would enjoy an 1800's title.Enjoy your reading!

  Wonderful look at a world long gone - it's difficult to grasp, in view of today's lack of manners and decorum, that there was once a time when people were polite, civil to each other, and, for the most part, educated.But the most amazing thing of all, to me, is that writers of that time - indeed util the advent of the typewriter and the computer - wrote these long novels by hand - pen and ink!!

  It was hard, deciding on 4 or 5 stars. I already knew the story, the players, the outcome, but I wanted to know the details too. Though I am a voracious reader, I've become spoiled by contemporary writing styles. Fast paced and with little depth or description, Jane's style requires one to slow down the pace to catch all the information and description. There were several places where I had to re-read passages because I forgot what she was trying to relate, but that is common in most older books. If the story wasn't so well known and cherished, it would rate a 4 star for a sometimes ponderous pace, but past the 50% mark, the story practically leaks the page.

    Jane Austen Is Remarkable!
  
",5.0,Leonna Burns,"Reviewed in the United States May 3, 2007","









  
  
    
  This is a love story that is slow developing, at least for Elizabeth Bennett. Because she is prejudice of Mr. Fitzwilliam Darcy, she cannot see his fascination with her, nor can she see his true disposistion, which is delightfully uncovered over time. His fascination stems from her lack of desire to cater to his apparant haughtiness. She mistakes his shyness for rudeness and his disdainment for silliness as resentment towards others.And we musn't forget dear Mrs. Jane. Her love for Mr. Bently and his for her, make this book even more enthralling, especially as it all unfolds.Mrs. Bingly is a vital character in this book as well, as she covers jealousy, treachery to certain extent, caniving, and even back-stabbing. Of course she wants Mr. Darcy for herself.Jane Austen created memorable characters that each become a major part of this story! From her Father, Mr. Bennett, to the rediculous Mr. Collins and from Mrs. Bennett to the very silly Lydia. She even goes into detail about how things end up for the characters she created, at the end of the book! Great writing!This story also is an awesome detail of what it was like in the 1700's for families and women. Jane did not deal with the political side of life in this book. Some reviews from famous author's were disappointed that the book did not contain any information about what the men did for a living, but that was not Jane's intention. It didn't matter what they did for a living. They ""went to town on business"" was enough information. You come to understand that women didn't marry for love much, as in the case of Mr. and Mrs. Bennett. It was a convenience to be married for many. It also showed how important it was for families to have sons.I highly recommend this book, and the movie. You will not be disappointed. It is a great read, over and over.

  This is my fourth copy of the book. I can't get enough of it. I've always loved this novel, even when I was introduced to it at 13 by means of the most recent movie transcript posted in a magazine meant for middle schoolers. I always picture Lizzie with keirha knightly, who I always saw do the character justice. As a gamer, I see Wickham's name as wiggums because he is just as silly as the name. Though the demon possessed cat would probably disagree.I digress, this book is one of my absolute favorites. Jane Austen was a very capable writer and continues to be successful. I always love returning to this book and forever will.

    PRIDE AND PREJUDICE by Jane Austen
  
",4.0,JDD,"Reviewed in the United States October 12, 2009","









  
  
    
  It is beneficial at times to step away from our classics of literature, to take them down from their high pedestals and look at them without pretension. No novel, no matter how well-regarded, is universally esteemed - Twain, Emerson, and Charlotte Bronte all savaged Pride and Prejudice in print - so let us, for a few moments, stop treating it as holy writ and just look at it as a novel, at how it holds up to a modern casual reader.Pride and Prejudice (1813) is Jane Austen's novel of manners - it thoroughly explores the ins, outs and economics of nineteenth-century courtship. The novel's central character is Elizabeth Bennet, one of five daughters, whose family lives in a country village. Two wealthy, eligible bachelors move to town, and romance, confusion and animosity ensue.Austen populates her novel with all manner of flawed characters. Many of them are annoying - that is, they behave badly and are antagonistic toward the main characters - but they all show at least some depth. No one here is without flaw, but no one here is without virtue, either (except Mr. Collins, the most ludicrous of them all). And this is why the novel works: because Austen treats her characters and their social milieu gently, delicately (well, except Mr. Collins). If she had done otherwise, if she had been more cutting, she would have lost the sympathy in the reader that many of these characters engender.To the modern audience, Austen's plotting is rather sluggish, although it must be recalled that novels moved at a rather more leisurely pace then. At any rate it often seems that there is one too many side plots, or perhaps one too many visits to relatives, and there are patches that can be quite hard to get through. But you don't go to Austen for plot - you go to her for clever dialogue, for a delightful turn of phrase. That is what she thrives at, and that is what she is best remembered for. And in spite of the novel's overlength, Austen delivers a full and completely satisfying payoff. Rarely is a happy ending so fulfilling, and it may not be until the last few pages of the book that it becomes evident to the reader how masterfully Austen has set it up. And this is a large reason why the novel has such enduring appeal.Much of the nuance in Pride and Prejudice may be lost on casual modern readers. For example, the character of Mrs. Bennet is the object of great scorn from many readers, and this has only been exacerbated by the film adaptations of the novel. But while marrying for love is the norm today, then, it was not; Mrs. Bennet is the only one looking out for the Bennet family's financial future.Pride and Prejudice is, on the whole, a satisfactory and clever novel, and, at present, one whose merits are diminished mostly by readers too far removed to understand it in its fullness, or whose tastes have diverged too far.

  I have read this book several times.  Jane Austen is a master of language and a genius at understanding and describing her society.  The characters are individuals and completely formed with all the individuality of a real person.  Each character could be a real person.  The development of the book and characters are riveting.  Jane Austen stands at the top of the list even though at the time she wrote she had to publish under a male name.  Since its first publication it has never been out of pring.  Lose yourself in a different time and culture as it comes to life of the pen of the indomitable Jane Austen.

  One of the wittiest authors of the English language presents THE classic story best exposing the concerns of intelligent, lively young women of marrying age, as seen thru a perspective of a British environment near the close of the 18th century. Since this original has an adept use of humor, philosophy and language raising it beyond the definition of a mere romance, many inferior romance novels have copied some of the elegant plot devices over the years. It wears well over time and many readings and may be listed as the favorite novel of more women than any other. The main character, Elizabeth, is certainly a favorite among women.

  Some of the way language was used when the book (1797) was written can be obtuse as to its meaning but this hardly detracts from this novel.

All of this however is minor considering the product.

  One of my all time favorites.  My 16 year old & my 13 year old really enjoy it too.  There is so much depth of story and character development.  The dialogue is extraordinary.  This is a timeless story.  You really feel like you know the characters in the end.My action movie-guy-film-loving husband has not read the book but he has watched and laughed along with the BBC movie Based on this book.  The movie is a multi-part series and we have watched this numerous times as a family and enjoyed it from start to finish.  However, being the person that I am, there is nothing like savoring the book.

  I can imagine that Elizabeth Bennet (Lizzy) is Jane Austen herself, couldn't you?Jane Austen is a wonderful writer. She deserves much praise. With extraordinary insight into feelings and actions of characters. She does a good job of making each character distinct and well defined. The Bantam Classic edition of all of the classics is much better then the Barnes and Noble version.You must read this book even if it's but only for once (even thought there may be a possibility of you may not liking it) to give credit to what I consider a historic acknowledgement to a female writer. Men can also learn much about the fact that not all women are the same.

  A mother's driving force is getting her five daughters married quickly; it hardly matters to whom. A suitor proposes, is summarily rejected and marries someone else within days. A woman doesn't like men but wants to get married anyway. A sixteen-year-old runs off with a man and doesn't marry him right away, much to the dismay of both her parents and sisters. A mother has no use for her daughter's suitor but happily accepts him into the family because he is rich. The less money a family has, the more important it is that all their daughters marry and quickly. If the family lives in the country, they must work harder to get these daughters married. Sound like your favorite sitcom and/or your favorite cousin and her family? Well, it's Jane Austin's timeless PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Here we have much ado about getting the daughters married.Everybody points out what is so unique about this novel as well as the rest of Austin's works. She does very little to place them in any given time. They are good because of what they don't tell us. Austin doesn't give us a lot of specificity about a lot of things. For example, The Bennetts are always entertaining yet we don't know much about what they eat other than ""venison"" or ""meat."" Wickham may wear a blue coat when he gets married. The young women often play music but we are never told the names of the pieces they play.The ironic first line of the novel is well-known: ""It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune, must be in want of a wife."" With that great opener, we are off to the races.Parts of this novel will make you smile; others will make your laugh. My favorite character is the father, Mr. Bennett, who is quick to see and point out his wife's and others' foibles but never sees his own. Somehow it seemed Jane Austen anticipated the future when much of her character's behavior would be seen as folly, though we certainly have follies of our own today.

",5.0,K. Johnson,"Reviewed in the United States February 6, 2006","









  
  
    
  This book was truly a delight to read (and to re-read many times)! Jane Austen is a literary genius! ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a heartwarming tale with a beautifully woven plot, filled with witty dialogue and, of course, a charming love story. It is no wonder that this book has been so wildly successful!Reading over the negative reviews of this book, I am very surprised that anyone could not like this story! I certainly don't know what these people were thinking when they decided that they didn't like ""Pride and Prejudice"". This has certainly surpassed all other novels as my favorite book of all-time. Perhaps some might find Jane Austen's language difficult to understand, but as a 14-year-old, I didn't think that it was that way at all. This book will certainly remain dear to my heart forever, and I can certainly see myself reading it still 30 years from now.Elizabeth is a delightful heroine, and there is nothing quite as satisfying as the humbling of Mr. Darcy. I only wished that there was more (or that I was assigned to read it for my English class, which I would do with much pleasure)!In conclusion--read this book, for goodness sakes! You won't be sorry.

  What can I say about a story that is a classic, filled with fun and intrigue and words I sometimes have to look up. I love this story of such delightful and sometimes annoying characters. I've now read it about 6 times, and found it such a fun read as to be my go-to when I can't find anything else to interest me. Make no mistake, Austen's representation of love and marriage, designs and schemes is a satirical look at Victorian courtship.

  Jane Austen's works are always engaging, entertaining, heart-warming, and funny. So well written and so much more true romance than any dime store novel ever could attain to be. The only downside is that this copy seems to have some glitch where it will double a sentence and place that 2nd sentence a few paragraphs later but it's in a way that it's obvious it doesn't belong there. The only thing I could figure was that in the hard copy there is some book print style picture with a quote from the book under it as would be typical in many books of this type and that in the kindle version it just doesn't show the picture.

  A classic. The first real boy-meets-girl romance ever written.Jane meets Darcy. She overhears some snobbish comments from him. He falls for her. She spurns him. She has a change of heart...but is is too late?Take some time to ease into the language - some people give up too soon in this. It's a bit challenging to read the formality of her writing. But the story is sparkling, the humor subtle and universal.Read this, and then read Persuasion - the story of what MIGHT have happened to Jane and Darcy.

  When I went to order this book I knew the story was fantastic already so the main goal was to find an addition with an attractive cover and a comfortable size. I think everyone knows the difficulty of reading a tiny book. So when I stumbled across this, I got pretty excited. When it arrived from the seller, though, it didn't resemble the picture. It was a bit smaller than I had expected and the cover was totally different which, not gonna lie, was a letdown. Ultimately, I didn't feel like sending it back, though. In whatever form, Pride and Prejudice is a classic and deserves a read. Just don't be surprised if the version you get isn't the one in the picture above.

  Thoroughly enjoyed Pride and Prejudice. I only wish Miss Austen lived in the age of writing a series of novels. I grew so fond of Elizabeth and Darcy...I was sad when I read that last page. I so wanted to know what happened next to these charming characters.In a world where movie characters too often end up in bed on the very day they meet, this old story is refreshing in its portrayal of two people who grew to love each other.  I can't help but think a love story like this is something every teenage girl should read...it may be an idealized love for sure...but what is wrong with that?

",5.0,Cary,"Reviewed in the United States November 11, 2012","









  
  
    
  It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a reader would find that books worth reading are worth reading twice and Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice is definitely one of them.Pride and Prejudice is actually the first classic book I've ever read from cover to cover. Since I'm not used to reading classics during that time, it took me ages before I get the hang of the story and eventually finish it. Nevertheless, I was able to appreciate the story and it instantly became my favorite. Well, who would not fall in love with the story of Lizzie and Mr. Darcy?Three years later, this book was chosen as the featured book for the October face-to-face discussion of my book club and so I decided to read it again since I wasn't able to retain most of the details of the story in my memory. It was worth reading twice indeed for I find it sweeter the second time around. For some weird reason, I am really a fan of love-hate story and it was only when I read this book the second time that I realized that this is the best love-hate story I've read so far. It was also in my second time that I was able to appreciate more the care-free character of Elizabeth Bennet, the snob-outside-but-soft-inside character of Mr. Darcy, the annoying character of Mrs. Bennet and the cool father character of Mr. Bennet.Pride and Prejudice is truly an enduring classic so no wonder it became one of the most popular books in English literature and inspired most of the novels of today and became the favorite subject for film and tv adaptations.

  I'm not going to say much about the actual content of this book. I've been a Jane Austen fan for years - I just read this book for the 4th time - obviously I love it. Her work isn't for everyone though - but there are enough other reviews out there for you to be able to figure out if you want to check her out or not (you should just give her a chance anyway).I just want to comment on this edition of the book. It's wonderful! I actually saw a picture of this on Instagram and HAD to find out where to buy it (turns out it was hidden in the depths of Amazon).I'm a Pride and Prejudice collector. I'm pretty sure I have 10 versions now - so when it comes to getting new versions, I'm all about judging the books by their covers. I also love Colin Firth, so the moment I saw this, I knew I had to have it. I love the classic pulp style of the cover and the techniques they used to make it look a little worn. The edges of the pages are a bright red - really eye catching. Other than that, it's a solid little paperback. Something I can see myself reading and reading again - on the beach, on vacation, while it gets a little more broken in each time - and the more worn it becomes the more I'll love it.If you're looking for a unique copy for your collection and maybe you're not ready to invest in a nice hardcover, I'd say go for this. I believe I got it for about $6 on Amazon.

  Just loving re-reading it.  I could read it over and over.  The language is so controlled and I did not catch all the humor when I read this as a teenager.  Much better as I have gotten older.  Austin must have had a delightful sense of humor to laugh so genteelly at herself and age.

  Would give this 5 stars,  but I am old and typos bug the heck out of me.  That said,  the numerous editorial comments are helpful to making this easier to read.  Many references to things we moderns know nothing about are rapidly explained in good humored fashion.  Once accustomed to the positioning, roughly alongside the corresponding text, it was placed in a non disruptive fashion (as opposed, for instance to footnotes).  As for Jane Austin,  there is nothing I can say about her writing,  other than there is a good reason she remains famous.

It would be improved in the sticker would be placed on the plastic wrapping that the book itself come in. It is not just this book, my order of Emma did the same thing.

  My first time reading this book.  Actually, my first Austen novel!  This one is a keeper.  Austen is a master at character development.  In this book she explores people's perceptions about others from they see, perceptions from what they hear about others, and then reveals the realities of each character.  My favorite character has to be Mr. Collins because Austen seems to have used him to add humor to her novel.  Great comic relief.

  When I opened up my copy of Pride and Prejudice, I didn't know what to expect.  I had heard from my friend that it was good, but I really didn't trust her taste.  I am forever thankful to her.Elizabeth Bennet, a young woman in a middle class society, and her sisters must marry in order to be guaranteed a comfortable life.  When Mr. Bingley and Mr. Darcy (two upper class men) come into town, Mrs. Bennet is determined to make the men fall in love with her daughters.  This leads to conflict, etc (sorry I don't want to give away too much!)I think the main reason why I love this book is that it is difficult to put down.  Austen's witty characters bring to Merrytown, never knowing what is going to happen next.  This book was, ""Impossible to imagine; it was impossible not to long to know""(59).

  Seriously - It's Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice - you shouldn't need my opinion to read this book.  It's more than a classic.  It's the prototype.  Just read it.  It will change the way you read.  It's so full of reality, told with such humor and subtlety and brilliance, you'll begin to gobble the other five novels she wrote in her short lifetime.  You'll understand why she turned down all of the suitors she had in her lifetime because she knew that it was more important for her to write than to make babies.  Just read it!

  I always intended to read Pride and Prejudice, but never followed through until now.  The characters were, in fact, extremely well developed and the tension created between Elizabeth and Darcy fortunately overshadowed the cloying Jane.Thoroughly enjoyed the book, but the side notes in this version were annoying.  Their placement interfered with smooth reading of the text.  The information presented in the side notes was neither appropriate, nor did it lend to the enjoyment of this novel.

  I am usually not a big fan of classical literatures. I often found them too slowly paced and devoid of action to my taste. My reason for reading Pride and Prejudice was a wish to improve my writing skills and I did not expect to enjoy it. I am glad to say that I couldn't have been more wrong.The story's theme is obvious upon reading the first page, that's it chiefly about marriage and scandals. I can't say that I was surprised by any of the plot development either. However, despite all of these I still thoroughly enjoyed the characters' developments and how they gradually grew closer together. It's nice to read a story where most character can find their own happiness - I am a bit sick of mordern television shows where the director feel compelled to kill off the audiences' favourite characters one after another.I am afraid that I do not fully comprehend the story, especially the writer's view on marriage and obedience. Partly because I am not well versed in the historical background of the story's settings, and partly because I was in too much of a hurry to find out the conclusion of the two main characters' relationship. I am not a patient reader. I would like to read the story once more to understand it better, but right now I wish to seek out more classical literatures that may interest me in the same way.

  Perhaps the mother of all romances, this classic crème de la crème Jane Austen story stands as a model that many modern romances seem formulated upon. Not a pure romance however, Austen offers so much more to her readers in P&P: realistic relationships, interesting characters, comical situations and compelling subplots force readers to think in many directions and entertain far and beyond boy loves girl. This particular copy of P&P would make a perfect little gift for anyone just introduced to the story or Austen through this latest movie version (or as a companion to the movie) and is a wonderful beginning to immersing oneself in the English language of 200 years ago. To be certain, this sort of old classic literature may be a challenge to peruse at first, but rest assured that it becomes easier to assimilate the more you read it.

  Pride and Prejudice by Jane AustenRecently I went on a drive home to California and back.  It's about 7 1/2 hours each way (because I actually go the speed limit!!!) and I wanted to try something new while driving.  So, I decided to try an audio recording.I found one from my local library of Pride and Prejudice.  :  Why not go with a classic book for the drive home?So, I listened to Pride and Prejudice by Jane Austen.Pride and Prejudice is the story of the Bennet sisters, Elizabeth and Jane.  Both are of marriageable age but do not come from the wealthiest of families.  However, they live in a time when marriage to someone with wealth is of utmost importance.Since they have no brothers, when their father dies his estate will go to another male relative, as they are unable to inherit.One summer a new family comes to live nearby, and Mrs. Bennet, their mother insists that Mr. Bennet make an acquaintance with Mr. Bingley, the new bachelor who is very wealthy.  At a ball one evening he is immediately taken with Jane Bennet who is admittedly beautiful, of a sweet nature, but perhaps below the standard of wealth into which he is expected to marry.But the problem really is his friend, Mr. Darcy.  A haughtier more proud man has never existed, and though that same night at the ball many women did not have partners as men were few, Mr. Darcy makes it clear that he thinks pretty negatively of Elizabeth Bennet.  He is cold, unfriendly, and seemingly unkind . . .Mrs. Bennet is determined to see her daughters married and encourages Jane and Mr. Bingley, but is desperate to make a match for Elizabeth, including pushing her to accept the proposal of marriage from her most insipid cousin.We follow the story of the Bennet family as others do everything they can to keep Jane and Mr. Bingley apart, and Elizabeth is forced into close proximity with the awful Mr. Darcy repeatedly.Will Jane and Elizabeth ever find true love that others will accept?  Or will their less wealthy state be their destruction?Read Pride and Prejudice to find out!This is a total and complete classic.  There are over 2 million copies sold worldwide, hundreds of editions, and quite a few different audio recordings, not to mention TV and movie versions of this story.If you haven't actually read Pride and Prejudice you simply must!  It's a beautiful, wonderful story full of lively characters with personality oozing from them.  Mrs. Bennet is incredibly silly, a trait which seems to have rubbed off thoroughly on several of her daughters.  But Jane and Elizabeth took far more after their father with much more sense.  It's the story of how pride and prejudice can keep you from truly seeing another's character, and how opinions can change when someone is given a true chance.I highly recommend this book to everyone!5 out of 5 stars!

  I must say I never imagined I would enjoy reading a 19th century romance, but it turns out that 'Pride and Prejudice' is an easy, pleasant and surprisingly engaging read. The story is set in rural England of early 19th century and is centered around Elizabeth, second daughter of the Bennets, and her evolving relationship with 'proud' Mr Darcy. The author has done an excellent job keeping the pace of the story, while painting excellent character portraits.--A minor note:Some people observe that the name of the county where the military regiment is settled appears as ""----shire"" throughout the book. Strange as that may seem, it is not a typographical error; it is actually how it appears in the original (you can check the free online editions of the novel on Project Gutenberg or Google Books). According to an annotated version by David M. Shapard, that was done in purpose by the author to avoid naming a particular county, although the reason is not known for certain.

  It's so nice to read a romantic novel that doesn't focus on sex and scandal! The book was written in a different time and place, classic literature to its core.

  Why is Jane Austen's work so popular even today?  Because she was just the best! This is on my personal top ten list. I've read it at least ten times and probably will read it several times again. It's funny, it's smart, it's  romantic, and Elizabeth Bennett is my all-time favorite fictional heroine.  You can read this book when you're 16 and every ten years after that. All  of Jane Austen's books are good, but this is her best - and a classic that  should be part of every woman's education and every woman's personal  library. It's also proof that a book can have sizzle without any explicit  sex.

  Does anyone write like this anymore?  Of course not; that era is gone.  A slow-moving novel about people's pride, their prejudices, and how these adversely affect their personal relationships.  I marvel continuously at Austen's ability (like Eliot; like Proust) to so vividly portray people, manners, affects, relationships, thoughts, neighborhoods, customs...  With subtlety and tact is each character drawn so that, as with all good novels, when we reach that last page it's as if we had spent a good month visiting with intimate friends and now it was time to go.

  Even though I am a guy who had accompanied his wife through every film relating to ""Pride and Prejudice,"" I enjoyed reading the book. Jane Austin gives details of the characters' thoughts that make the story, especially the development of the two main characters, convincing. The other characters are amusing and vivid. The dialogue is delicious with treats like, ""Is not general incivility the very essence of love?""In my Kindle version random line breaks occur. For example, one often encounters ""Mr. [line break] Darcy,"" even when ""Mr."" is almost the beginning of the line. Although this is a little annoying, the Kindle version can't be beat for price and convenience.

  I adore Pride and Prejudice, but this edition is totally non-readable on my Kindle.  I can't even see the type except when it is actually in the process of loading the page.  Once loaded, it's so grayed-out that I am unable to see it.  I am certainly glad that I got this free rather than paying anything for it.

  Being a 20 something male, I was not sure what to think when I picked up this novel.  I knew that girls had always loved this book, so I set myself up for a girlie novel.  Elizabeth, the protaganist, is anything but a simple girlie character though.  This book attacks the social structure of Austen's days.  The characters are deep and well written.  Some are characatures for comic relief, but you still come away with the feeling that you have known someone like that in the past.  This book is a classic for a reason.  I recommend this book to anyone, not just love sick teenage girls.

    Old School Dialog

  If you ever wanted to read pithy, sharp and incessant insults, all cleverly disguised as politeness, this is the book for you.  This is a throw back to when language was intended to communicate complexities, long before bumper stickers and short poetry replaced critical thinking and historical fact.  The dialog is marvelous and will enrapture the imagination while engaging the mind wonderfully.  A touching, but very humorous tale.

    To put this book down felt wrong
  
",5.0,Darshik Garach,"Reviewed in the United States April 4, 2013","









  
  
    
  I thoroughly enjoyed this book, from the detail of the characters, their witty remarks and the sure ease of read. I found it hard to put this book down - it just felt wrong. The characters hold their own with such vast differences and sometimes seemingly defects that I found i could relate to some of them in many ways. I greatly admire both Darcy and Elizabeth equally and favour neither over the other. I also find myself relating to the worries of Mrs. Bennet - and over time, though she seems very much a pain to Elizabeth and the family, she does justice to them all as a mother. Her sole focus is the attention to her children and ensuring that they marry suitably and are secured for the future - though for her, this security is based around financials. Mr. Bennet is a very ""chilled"" guy, and his character really does reduce the tension that plagues the family. He also relates incredibly to Elizabeth, and is proud of her independence - I think he sees a lot of himself in her! I could go on and on about the story, but to all who have read it will understand and to all who haven’t and are planning too, I envy you. In any case, this book is by far, my most favourite book. Period! And now that I have written this, I think I will read it again...and read it annually as well!

  I have probably read this book about 5 times over the last 10 years and each time am drawn in by Austen 's colorful, complex and delightful characters. Each time, I mourn over Lydia's poor choices, laugh with Elizabeth at Mr Collins, and fall in love with Mr Darcy (to my husband's dismay). For those who enjoy witty comebacks, romance, and the Victorian era, you will absolutely love this book.  If you think you know it all because you've seen the movie, think again and give the book a chance. You won't regret it!

",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States March 3, 1998","









  
  
    
  In case you are wondering, the novel it tied with is Dostoevsky's THE BROTHERS KARAMAZOV. I have read this three times in three sittings.  In case that is not clear, I mean to say that I have sat down to read PRIDE AND PREJUDICE on three separate occasions, and did not get up until I had finished it.  I once stayed up all night long to finish it. Actually, I read it a fourth time, aloud to my then 8-year-old daughter Elizabeth (who was delighted to find an Elizabeth in the book).  She liked it so much that she in turn read it twice.  Just one of the great, irrestible book in the English language.

It has a page of notes, maps, and drawings for each page of text.  It can enhance the reader's knowledge although it takes longer to read the book.  If you buy Shapard's book, get the updated 2012 edition instead of the 2008 edition.

",4.0,Kiki,"Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2013","









  
  
    
  I've always quite enjoyed reading the classics, especially the Bronte sisters ones, and anything by Jane Austen. I enjoyed this book as well, though not quite as much as I loved Wuthering Heights. The characters are well developed, though they take some time to really get in to. Once Mr. Darcy comes onto the scene, things heat up a little, but most of the book seems to be about anticipation. This can be quite enjoyable for someone that loves to analyze and anticipate things, however I can not see people who only love action and adventure being able to get past the first chapter.Still, I would read it a second time for the same reason I read Jane Eyre again, it's enjoyable to get to the heart of a character and feel with them, wait with them, and try with them!

  Jane Austen - as always - writes with harmony and good sense. She draws memorable, believable characters, and the plotline is marked by an adult view of the world. But the whole thing is too neat: The fates of the characters are wish fulfilment. Still, probably one of the better books in the Western canon.

  What can I say? This has been a classic for two hundred years. I loved it. Very slow reading, as many words are not in common use today, the sentence structure is often complex and requires rereading, and the social structure was different.

  I never do reviews but when this popped  up in my email I couldn’t ignore. I tried to read this book, but it was hard. It’s the exact same story with roles reversed. I know that’s what it claims to be, but I was expecting some creative license or interpretation by the author. Nope. Nothing. Same story just trade boys for girls and sons for daughters. I feel like the theme of gender reversal is rich ground for metaphor, social commentary, and story and this failed that potential greatly. Sad, because I was so looking forward to it.

",5.0,Liz Ellerbe,"Reviewed in the United States February 21, 2008","









  
  
    
  One reviewer (Jane Stewart) thanked me for my input on the ""revised"" setting of P&P.  My reasoning came after my desire to have the setting be the end of the beautiful 18th Century - not the industrialized 19th.  Jane Austen wrote the book in 1796, and it was published 17 years later, but it was the SAME book, and she naturally wrote about her time period.  So I deducted 17 years from 1813, which equals 1796.  (Note: An astute reviewer on Amazon also pinpointed the timeframe of 1794-1796 with a French action that Jane Austen mentioned, related to P&P.)

  An improvement on 'Sense and Sensibility' but still slow-moving due to the English social customs and manners of the 18th century.The (modern) direct approach of the characters talking to each other openly is taboo - instead we get agonised speculation drawn out over many pages.  Again here a DVD/TV version is probably better - or read Mansfield Park first.  Again here we have 'cipher' characters, one representing Pride and the other Prejudice, and modern credibilities are stretched as the characters are kept strictly within these moulds.

",5.0,XE,"Reviewed in the United States January 14, 2017","I will freely admit to some trepidation in reviewing such a well-known book. Being as it is my first classic that I have considered reviewing, and one that has garnered much praise and censure that I believe I will not be able to add anything new, I did indeed waffle back and forth on whether or not it'd benefit me or anyone in my sphere to do so. I eventually decided that it'd be a fun challenge for me as well as not wanting to break my recent habit of reviewing every book that I read.

Be forewarned, I have watched the BBC version of this story many times for somewhere in the ballpark of 15 years. This means the story as a whole was not new to me, though the particulars were.

I did realize before reading this book that there were bound to be aspects which seemed odd to me, or that I may dislike, that would be considered part of the time period and other such nonsense. Basically, in stating what I did not take pleasure in, I hope not to draw criticism in the form of ""Well, that's part of what makes it a classic."" or ""That's the way stories were told back then and is beyond critique.""

I'll start with my minor annoyances, since they were so few and far between as to hold little impact on the whole and should not take much time to convey.

Early on I noticed a penchant for -- certain words either partially or in their entirety. At first I thought Austen was too lazy to type out those words and therefore just expected me to know what went there, but then I thought, ""If she was perfectly content writing out this long of a book, I highly doubt she'd lower the quality of the story by being lazy on a few words."" So yes, I did some research and found it was a habit of writers of the time to dash words so as not to offend people who may live on those streets, or in those towns, or who were part of those militias, etc.

Though I know understand the reason behind the ""dashing"", it was still an irritation and I think omitting a word, or part of one, so as not to offend the sensitivities of someone who might feel slighted that an author is casting any sort of undesirable traits to an area a person may be connected with is silly. And I read what is before me so every time I'd come upon one such instance I'd go, ""The (blank)shire"" or ""the something that's in Hertfordshire."" I wouldn't make up my own town, or street, or whatever I was supposed to supply.

I winced at every ""chuse"" and ""shew"". I get it. It was most likely the way to spell show and choose at the time, but ugh, my mind wanted to slay every usage of the two.

And really, that was all the negative I have to say.

The story itself didn't hold much mystery, as I am very familiar with it. I can't speak on the storyline, the characters, or any other such aspect which I feel best qualified to judge when the story is new to me.

I was most pleased that the tv miniseries was, for the most part, faithful to the novel. I felt some hesitancy in reading this initially, in case it did lessen my enjoyment of a long time favorite movie.

Some conversations were moved, or shorten, or even omitted. There were scenes that didn't exist in the movie. The greatest alteration that I detected was from the point where Lizzy meets Darcy on his property until the end of the book. There was a great deal that'd been altered or added, deleted. Things such as Darcy diving in the lake and appearing half-dressed, Lizzy and her family continuing their tour of the grounds after that meeting, and lots of little things. Georgiana was much more a background character in the sense that I didn't really get a feel for her. In truth the movie did a much better job of highlighting the secondary characters such as Mary, Kitty, Georgiana, Louisa, etc. Not that all secondary characters need such illumination, but I enjoy getting a sense of them.

Despite a fair bit of differences in the last part of the book from what I'm used to, the story was engaging and I maintain that the BBC version did capture the essence of the book.

I particularly found the conversations that I wasn't privy to in the movie to be the most interesting aspect. My favorite part of the story has always been the dialogue. I love the banter that goes on between the characters. The subtle jabs that can be seen, even wrapped though they are in politeness and proper manners. The embarrassment Lizzy must of felt by the actions and speech of her family was so apparent because the sense of the time and what was proper was so thoroughly portrayed throughout the book. I found several little pieces here and there of where Lizzy is ruminating on something that I found particularly delightful because I've been in a position to think something along those lines myself.

I feel like the mortification surrounding Darcy and his actions to her, and hers to him, and the impact her family had, came through much stronger in the novel than in the movie. I enjoyed getting more into Lizzy's head with that.

Jane was much more annoying to me as her insistence on seeing no evil was so much more dwelled upon that I wanted to smack some sense into her.

The father, I always knew, had several faults and had done the family many a disservice by his actions or rather lack of action, but with the book it was much more blatant and I think above all the characters, his was the most changed in my estimation upon conclusion of the story.

Overall, yes, this is a book that you need to slow down and savor to get the full effect of what lies inside. It is a story that focuses on the everyday life of a family and can be slow in terms of plot if you're not stopping to smell the roses. It won't be for everyone, and as a reader who primarily enjoys fantasy, I can understand that, but this is one of those historical pieces that engaged me throughout and never did I find myself skimming or bored. I loved how the ending wrapped up everyone's lives more tightly than the movie did, and I shall now be able to see I've seen both the movie and read the book and enjoyed both. Rather than diminishing my pleasure of the former, the latter has only increased the depth of it. I'll now watch and now what is going on that I do not see.",

  I recently had a chance to see the full Masterpiece Theater production of Pride and Prejudice (if you have never seen Colin Firth as Mr. Darcy, you haven't lived) and loved it as much as ever.  Now that I have a Kindle and many of the classics are free I couldn't resist.  I recalled that the dialogue in the series was almost verbatim from the book but I hadn't read the book in so many years that I couldn't recall how well the rest matched up.  They are different because the book does a lot of narration that in the film had to be shown by activity, so it gives a different insight into your favorite characters.  I was delighted to find so much in the book not in the series.The book is a perfect delight and it obvious why this treasure by Jane Austin ranks so high in the lists of English literature.  Austin's skill at dialogue, character and plot development are unmatched.  I had intended to just skim the book to pick up the pieces I wanted but I read every word and was delighted with the extra sections in the book not in the series.  I highly recommend it.

  I am sort of embarrassed to admit that I hadn't read Pride and Prejudice earlier.It is by far one of the best novels I have read in a very very long time.I won't comment on the storyline (which I loved and was rooting for Mr. Darcy all along) since it is so well known.Concerning this edition/print, there were a few instances (mainly when printing names of cities) in which the whole word wasn't spelled out; instead a few dashes (-) replaced some letters. However, that did not ruin the story or the pleasure from eagerly finding out what happens next.I would like to point out too that in a time where romance has become so cheap and materialistic and love stories are so commercialized, it was refreshing to read a true classic.A must read for everyone!

  I bought the set of audiotapes with no particular expectations, and I am pleasantly surprised. Ms Sharon Williams's reading is amazingly smooth, natural, and she depicts the personalities of each character with the intonations of her voice so perfectly that it always sound like there's more than one person reading, even though she doesn't alter her voice. I am particularly amazed by her rendition of Mrs Bennet. I can almost see the woman when I hear the talk!As an American, I am not fond of British accents, and I am happy to hear that Ms Williams read with some British influence, but it is overall pleasant and easy for me to understand. (In contrast, I dislike the accents on the Harry Potter movies.)I highly recommend this product.(If you haven't read Pride and Prejudice yet and is wondering if you should, the answer is yes! The classics are usually a drag to read, but not Pride and Prejudice. It moves fast, it is witty, insightful, and the language is easy to understand. I think it is the best book among the classics.)

  200 years after the death of the author, PRIDE AND PREJUDICE continues to intrigue readers.  Although it relates to a courtship, society mores of its time, and a marriage, as do all of Austen's stories,  it is beautifully told by a shrewd observer (Jane Austen) of her culture and time in history.  We may not want to live in England's Regency Period, but reading about it fascinates us because people then shared characteristics with people now, so we recognize them in the setting that is so different from ours.

Such a great escape from the every day life.  Pretty sure Downton Abbey will make things clearer.  The similarities are outstanding.

    Pride and Prejudice
  
",5.0,Rachel Schwarz,"Reviewed in the United States January 29, 2010","









  
  
    
  By far one of Jane Austen's most celebrated novels, Pride and Prejudice exists as a groundbreaking novel that paved the way for entertainment today. Think of Pride and Prejudice as a 19th century daytime soap chock-full of deceit and motive. Without the novel, we would probably live in a world free from ""Gossip Girl"" and ""The Hills"". Well, I guess that wouldn't be such a tragedy. But overall, Pride and Prejudice displays Austen's precise use of the English language, coupled with intricate interpersonal relationships that are sure to keep readers amused. Pride and Prejudice centers on the Bennets, a middle class family living in 19th century rural England. The protagonist, Elizabeth Bennet, is witty and attractive while her older sister Jane is shy and sensible. Their younger sisters, Mary, Kitty, and Lydia exist as foils; as they are immature and ridiculous. Also in contrast, Mrs.Bennet is scatter-brained and judgmental, while Mr. Bennet is serious and dislikes any frivolity. The Bennets' world is turned upside down when a wealthy gentleman named Mr.Bingley arrives at his country home in a neighboring town. Accompanying Mr.Bingley are his snobby sisters and his impolite friend Mr.Darcy. It is when the Bennets, particularly Elizabeth and Jane, begin to intermix with their upper class arrivals that the drama is truly set in motion. The characters from both economic classes experience love, heartbreak, deceit, loss, and the side effects of pride and social standing. For those readers who seek an action packed, plot driven novel, Pride and Prejudice is not for you. The novel relies on character development and there are several chapters where the plot remains stagnated. Also, it is difficult at times to decipher some of the text, due to the fact that it is written in antiquated English. Again, this book is not for you if you do not wish to interpret phrases such as ""she fancied herself nervous"" (page 7) or ""a mixture of quick parts"" (page 7). Although it is more of a difficult read and is often stagnant, Pride and Prejudice has remained a classic for a reason. The novel's romanticism and elaborate depiction of characters has and will continue to make it a favorite among readers.

The included ""insights"" detracted from the story with unnecessary movie facts, comments about characters that included ""lame"" and ""aww,"" and incorrect stats about divorce rates in America. It was so horrible that I sought the ""plain"" version of the story so I wouldn't have to suffer through this version any longer. Ahh, much better, and no clunky layout for all those ""insights.""

  As a sincere fan of Pride & Prejudice, I have been wanting a quality hardcover copy for what seems like forever! Most of the utterly gorgeous copies were a startling price but this book fell into my budget nicely.It's so pretty. The color pallate on this book is amazing and the size is perfect for most purses. I love the feel of the book in hand, it just feels like a quality book.

  I really enjoyed the story line, so I gave it four stars. However, I must say it was difficult reading because of the way they conversed. I would read a sentence at times and then had to figure out what was actually said. I am an incurably romantic so I would have to recommend the book to all that share the same feelings.

  This was the book I had been looking for - it is one of six in a series of Jane Austens'work.  It is my favorite - the love story of Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.  I would recommend this book to every woman to read - it transports you to a time of so much traditions, social manners and Miss Austen does an excellent job of explaining the ways of the English gentry at that time.  It is a wonderful love story and I am so happy that I found all six of the novels by Miss Austen in this series.

  life in england just before the neopolianic war(?).  Jane Austen captures the life and time of england as in the late 1800's.  the changing classes, women's rights, old rules and new ways.  The main theme is personal impressions of other people and whether or not these impression pan out.  the main character forms and changes her oppinions of people multiple times, until she accepts her own pride and prejudices.  a great story.

",5.0,S. Schaffer,"Reviewed in the United States June 1, 2007","









  
  
    
  I enjoyed this classic totally.  I thought the way Jane Austen developed the characters personalities was incredible.  I have reread it many times.  I am amazed at how much an author can get across without the overuse of sex and violence (that we see way too much of today).  I have also enjoyed her other works Emma and Sense and Sensibility.  I have not read the others.I have found the Pride and Prejudice movie from A&E with Collin Firth to be one of my favorite movies and I think is an excellent addition to have.  The Annotated Pride and Prejudice is very helpful and enjoyable by David Shapard.  The World of Her Novels by Deirdre Le Faye is also very helpful though at times seems a bit heavy.  It gives you a real feel for the era and thus the settings of the book.A word of caution.  When you enjoy something you don't want it to end.  Of the countless spinoffs of the original I totally disliked one and am in the middle of another.  Mr. Darcy takes a wife is unbelievable and totally devoid of character.  Seems there are sex scenes on almost every page in the beginning.  I grew disgusted.  The account of things from Darcy's point of view by Pamela Aidan has been enjoyable.  I am only half way thru the first book, however.

  The second Austen novel I ever read, and it continues to be one of my favorites. Elizabeth and Jane provide wonderful ""heroines"" as they find love in unexpected and expected places, respectively.

    Don't judge a book by it's age
  
",5.0,Brittney Gossard,"Reviewed in the United States October 5, 2000","









  
  
    
  It is a common tragedy that many high-schoolers and even adults do not read old books because they believe the books are not relevant. My words for them: human nature has not changed one bit since Jane Austen crafted her magic. Many people begin their reviews with ""Once you get past . . ."" but if any element were left out of this book (victorian society, language, high formality) it would diminish the book. Austen has shown through her characters the importance of valuing a person for who they truly are while 1) making fun of prudish victorian standards 2) showing gossip for the destructor it is, and 3) being one of the first writers to promote free thinking women as opposed to silly girls. Pride and Prejudice is called a classic for a reason: it will always remain a literary treasure.

  The story begins slowly as I believe most good reads do.  There are many characters to introduce and the interactions between each.  I liked the style and the  author's revealing the thoughts and feelings of the main characters.  This novel opens your thoughts as to how society viewed relationships.  My favorite part of the story is Elizabeth's realization that she has fallen in love.  I think this is a good read for any one who likes a romantic story, but there is more to it than that.

  The best of what Austen had to offer. Lizzie Bennett is the prototypical heroine in the prototypical romantic comedy. 200 years later they're still emulating her and the formula to varying degrees of success. The characters are all well thought out and interact in a natural way. Jane Austen knew the setting very well, and took full advantage of that knowledge.

  Pride and Prejudice was the book that introduced me to Jane Austen. I find the love story between Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth simply irresistible. Will they get together? That kept me in agony. I have to admit that it was hard  to follow at times, but it still kept me in suspense. It is so obvious that  today's female (and some male) writers emulate Austen's writing, writing  touching romantic comedies. This is definitely one of the books that I'm  proud to keep on my bookshelf.

  Once I got accustomed to the language, the story line was very engaging.  As a 21st century American, I found the flowery expressions used were almost like learning a new language by immersion.  It was very interesting to learn about the culture of that time. Who knew the gentry did so much walking?  Politeness, extravagant flattery and social climbing was unrestrained!  Most judgmental remarks by the characters were refreshingly tempered by an effort to give the person the benefit of the doubt.  All the plot twists made it a page turner.  Independent thinking Elizabeth could certainly qualify as a modern woman.  It was a very good read.

Mr. Darcy and Elisabeth certainly overcome their personal prejudices and let pride out the window. I enjoyed the read even more than the movie! I wish I had read it, as my normal custom, first.

  This is actually the first Jane Austen book I've read. So it was a little hard to read at first because of the old English. That soon passed however and it was definitely a great book. I've always loved the Pride and Prejudice (2005) movie, so I decided that, since books are always better than the movie, I should read the book! Definitely recommend!

    Jane Austen's finest novel!
  
",5.0,Maui_Lover,"Reviewed in the United States February 4, 2002","









  
  
    
  Pride and Prejudice is a great classic and should be read by anyone who enjoys Victorian Romance. The beautiful, intelligent, head strong Elizabeth Bennet has finally met her match in the arrogant, proud Mr. Darcy. Their tumultuous romance is extremely humorous and delightful to read.Although Jane Austen was a talented novelist, she was harshly criticized during her day for writing about marriage and the social life of well-bred, 19th century British women as opposed to more serious topics such as the French and American revolutionary wars. I however, believe that Ms. Austen was ahead of her time, exploring the world of gender politics with every witty heroine she created.Pride and Prejudice is a timeless tale that is just as enjoyable today as it was centuries ago.  In fact, You may notice that this story is very influential in modern films and books, most recently in Bridget Jones's Diary. I recommend it highly!

  What can I say about Pride and Prejudice that hasn't already been said? I read this when I was in junior high and didn't really like it. What was I thinking? It's been my all-time favorite novel for the past ten years or so. Its themes are the basis for hundreds of novels, movies and plays. Just think of how many stories you've read or seen that have the two main characters disliking each other, bickering and finally realizing that they love each other. If you just can't get enough of Pride and Prejudice, I suggest reading Pamela Aidan's series which tells the same story from Darcy's point of view.

There is even a section for ""new & used"" I have purchased many books(university,too) from the ""used"" section many times and have never been disappointed. The prices are always good, and sometimes if I have to pay shipping, it is more than reasonable.

  I had remembered the romance from previous reading, and because perhaps that is what the movie emphasized.  But the humor!  This is a very funny book, though the dysfunctional family part of it is darkish.  The fact that I knew who was going to win whom in no way detracted from the pleasure of the journey.  Younger readers will stretch their vocabulary and handling of syntax.  Can't regret that!

I recieved them yesterday and was very please with them. The pictures do not do them justice. They are gorgeous. I was afraid they would not be very durable, but they are very sturdy and the paper used for the pages is nice and thick. I wanted to find copies of my favorite classics that I can have for a long time and that would hold up to many re-reads and that is exactly what I have found in these. It doesn't hurt that they look great on the boofshelf either. I am also very glad that I ordered them from amazon and not from someone else (I did see them on a few other sites, for full price) because the price was amazing and they arrived properly packaged and in perfect condition with not a single flaw or bent corner, which happens easily to hard covers. I can't wait to order the rest of these beautiful penguine classics!

  , deals with issues Miss Austen would be shocked, and in some cases, horrified by. But never would she fail to understand the unchanging character of the human condition that I wrote about in 19th & 20th century America. Her insights into the human spirit and behavior in the early 1800s, seemingly so simple and commonplace, are as deep as the most profound novelists of any age. If one desires a book offering endless pleasure, one that could be reread once a year for a lifetime, then I strongly urge one to read ""Pride and Prejudice.""

  This novel may not ‘take you in’ immediately... persist -- by the fifth or sixth (short) chapter you will have ‘caught on’. Author Jane Austen is illustrating (ridiculing?) the ‘manners’ and mannerisms of the British aristocracy of the era. First published in 1813, the pace and dynamics of the story and its characters are slow by modern measure. I lit into the read without a bit of knowledge of the book beyond its high place in great literature and it can be too easy to judge 19th century literature by misplaced 21st century expectations. Even a wikipedia article’s worth of preparation would have focused the read earlier for me, nonetheless, once oriented to Jane Austen’s objective the reader becomes an interested spectator, often surprised, or amazed, or appalled by the cunning, slyness, and occasionally viciousness of the characters intentions constrained by the language (snarky?) and manners (starched) of the Regency Era.The novel is a ‘must read’ if you are interested in serious literature.______________________Try to find another publication if you read this book on a kindle. A digital scan of hardcopy followed by a slap-dash plunge through Optical Character Reader (OCR) software with little or even NO follow-up editing produces the sloppy text you will have to put up with throughout this poorly done version.

The unsuspected decisions and changes of plot keep you on your toes wishing for more. The description and personalities of the characters is extraordinary and you feel yourself intrigued within the story, and falling in love with Mr. Darcy alongside Elizabeth. The end is perfect in every way possible, but you can't help yourself wishing for it not to end though. Her vocabulary and formality may at times be more difficult but it makes it all the more interesting.

  I avoided this book like the plague. All my life I have not heard the truth about this book. I did NOT know this was a classic. The title always suggested to me this was a mid 20th century love story. UGHGH! 20th century love stories are based on sex and not true affection and I'm not interested in those stories. Not one person ever told me otherwise. I would see the title in tv stories or in articles, but nothing to lead me to believe this was a classic. Because my mind was convinced this was a 20th century book I paid no attention to the book and I don't think I related Jane Austen to this book. Recently a coworker and I talked about how we have these ""special weekends"" with movies and her special weekend is with the PBS version of Pride and Prejudice. This was the first time I learned this was an old world love story from the 19th century. Well that was all I needed, I devoured this book in 3 days!

  This story was written more than about two hundred years ago, yet the values it brings are very true and may last forever. One should never judged others without walking their shoes or at least knowing something about them. Lizzy is a smart, thoughtful girl but she have given her judgments too quick. Mr Darcy, well I suspect he is just a highborn guy, possesses good qualities but just not as sociable and vocal. The journey that the two main characters go to explore themselves and their other half is written in a beautiful way and full of surprises. Reading the story then watching the movie is such a great experience for me.

  This classic is wonderful, but there were too many grammatical errors.  This is apart from the dialect and writing style of Jane Austen.  There were letters, words, and sometimes parts of words that were missing.  In some cases parts of words were replaced with '---'.  This is irritating, but doesn't detract from the context of the story.  Just know to expect it if you purchase this version of the book.  It would be a smoother read if the errors were corrected.

  A very engaging love story, so true to its title! The virtue of pride and the vices of prejudice, vanity are depicted perfectly in the story. The style of writing, however is very complex and reflects the 19th century time it is based on. Sentences are long with multiple clauses, verbs are followed with negation (contrary to the current practice where negation precedes verbs) which may escape attention and twist the meaning of the whole sentence. Hence reading this book is a good way to practice focusing on the task at hand and increase concentration!

  This classic novel is as relevant today as it was when it was written many years ago.  There's a lot of silliness in the chatter of the young ladies but not nearly so much as in the movie version.  You will be taken back into a long-ago era in which all mothers of teenaged girls fretted over how many pounds a year the potential suitors of their daughters could expect to live on.  It reminds us that casual conversations overheard can lead to great misunderstandings and potential heartbreak. The language is refreshing, for no one talks this way today.

  To my English teachers and friends who have raved that I should read this. Check. Done!  My grade for this book is a C- and that was with the help of Carolyn Seymour, the narrator. Glad I read it so I could say I did, but I was not wowed like others.I couldn't have gotten into it as a tree book, even on Kindle with text-to-speech I couldn't get there. Though  the reader did add a lot to the experience, in the beginning, I'm afraid there was no help.The first half of the book seemed centered around bickering, gossip, and how women of the time could climb the status ladder. Ms. Seymour's varied voices just made that part even more irritating. I felt sorry for the reader as there was no way to vary the voices enough within that family of females. Lizzy and Jane's father was probably easy to do. And the voice of Darcy felt unique. But other than those voices, I couldn't tell whose voice belonged to whom.As for the book itself, I felt that the real book started about 3/4 in. That's where it all started to get exciting. I suddenly cared for a few people. It may be that the passive voice that seems to live in most so-called classics that made this less than wonderful. I plan to watch a couple versions of the movie next. Then there are possible book two by more recent authors. And... I'm not done with Jane Austen. I do plan to read them all, somehow. After all, these follow my main goal of reading books by females with strong female leads.

  I'll admit that I hated this book the first time I tried reading it. The second attempt made me love it, however. I later realized that people hate the book, not because it's not well-written (because it certainly is!), but because they don't understand it. Ironically, this is the exact reason Elizabeth hates Mr. Darcy. My advice to all those who think they hate the book: look a little deeper and see if your understanding isn't the problem. It was my problem.

It gives you a greater sense of the feelings and thoughts of the character which only adds to the story. If you haven't had the pleasure of reading this book or watching the Colin Firth version of the movie do yourself a favor and make up a big batch of popcorn and put your pajamas on and enjoy an enchanting moment in time!

",5.0,Bec Wolfe-Thomas,"Reviewed in the United States June 24, 2016","









  
  
    
  Pride and Prejudice is one of my favorite books and I’ve read it many times.  It’s a book that my best friend hates and we often talk about whether it’s romantic clap trap (my friends opinion) or a book that was the leading edge of feminism in its day (my opinion).  I think people forget that Jane Austen wrote this as a satire; she is making fun of the social atmosphere of the day.The opening of Pride and Prejudice reads “It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife.”  This set the tone for the story and the thinking of the day.  Women had a lot fewer options and marring well was a big deal still and considered a good life decision.  When the original manuscript was written in the late 18th century a women’s options we few and a women that could read and write was still look upon unfavorably by many; they were referred to as bluestockings and Jane Austen herself had to publish under a pen name because she was a woman.  Even though there is a romance that goes through some interesting twists in this book and that is what many people think this book is about its ultimately about women, their expected lot in life and Austen making fun of it.  It was books like Pride and Prejudice that was the foundation for women standing up for themselves and women’s rights.  Pride and Prejudice is not only one of my favorite books because Darcy had to work for it and learn from his mistakes but also because it’s a great reminder of how far women have come.Yes I think the romance that happens is sweet but it is Elizabeth that turned down an extremely rich guy, something that would have been shocking for a young lady to do, that I really love.  Elizabeth who was willing to follow her own mind and be herself, something that many women would not have braved in that day, that really draws me in.  Jane Austen used her books to show women are equals and I thank her for writing that reminder for future generations.

  This book was a nice, romantic novel with lovely descriptions allowing you to transport fully into the story.  There were ironies and plenty of opportunities to dwell on the intricacies of the characters.  Books today are rarely written with the depth of language and description found in Pride and Prejudice.  It makes it even more touching to read knowing that Jane Austin, the author, faced a similar ""socially forbidden"" love without quite the happy ending found in this epic.

  It seems almost pointless to write a simple review on this book, but I'm going to anyway.  I had to read this for my Women in Literature and Visual Arts class, and it was enjoyable.  The characters are well developed, and the plot is simple enough to understand.  Overall the book was a bit dry for my personal taste, but it was still good.  Jane Austen is a superb author, so it is certainly worth reading.

  I select books to read by authors.  I found out about Jane Austen when I was 12 years old and found a pretty blue book titled JANE in my school library. That was back around 1958 before Jane Austen groupies came along.  I enjoyed it and went on to PRIDE AND PREJUDICE.  I read somewhere that Disraeli read the book six or eight times and now between us we have read it at least 15 times and I enjoy it every time.  After all we enjoy great music no matter how many times we hear it, do we not?  Austen just has such a wonderful way of putting words together and her ideas are ageless.

  Almost every woman I've known loved to watch at least one of the many adaptations, especially the one with Knightley, and then they go on to tell me that there are certain classics one simply must read, recently one actually threw the book at me, so at long last I got around to it, thinking there was simply no way I could enjoy such a chick flick. Wrong! Austen is delightful (just had to use that word, with an English accent of course) and funny in her witty sort of way. By modern standards, the characterization leaves much to be desired, blah blah blah, if you're looking for straight story without any of the frills, look no further. Her writing style was way before her time, especially with handling the inner thoughts of her characters. And yes, guys, although this is no doubt a chick flick (common ladies, the most dangerous thing to happen was someone running away), it does have its moments, and the most kickass character was a dude: their dad was a trip. Anyone who is serious about writing should at some point pick up this book. Austen knew exactly what she was doing and you just might learn a thing or two.

You want to reach into the book and tell the characters you know the solutions to all their problems.  You cheer the characters on through their pleasures and foibles.

    No pride nor prejudice
  
",5.0,R. RESTALL,"Reviewed in the United States June 16, 2013","









  
  
    
  Rated by a significant proportion of erudite people as the best novel ever written, one can only go along with the majority, without any pride nor prejudice, and agree. The story of a man whose pride blinds him to his prejudices and a woman who's prejudices blind her to her pride is so well told and engaging as to be truly difficult to put down. I first read it at school around 70 years ago, and re-read it again last year. I was honestly surprised at how much I enjoyed it.

",5.0,K's Mom,"Reviewed in the United States August 21, 2010","









  
  
    
  I enjoy Jane Austen as an author and I have always favored Pride and Prejudice. The digital version on Kindle has a lot of capitalized words that were not written that way and, with today's technology, it does appear to be shouting. Some of the words are missing half of the letters and one can only guess at what the word should be. The overall story remains one of my favorites.

  Although those familiar with the movie and TV interpretations of Jane Austen's most famous novel may find the book's dated style a bit challenging at first, it is well worth the effort of becoming familiar with it. Readers can put their own life into this classic romance of opposites, Elizabeth and Darcy. The host of richly drawn characters around them and lovely settings bring the tale to life. Once engaged, it is both hard to put down and enchanting to revisit. Recommended for both the rom-com set and hard nosed businessmen looking for some escapist literature.

  The printing in this addition makes it uncomfortable to read.  Sentences are split up and/or run together.  This is also true of paragraphs.

I am disappointed Amazon would sell this to it's Kindle readers.

  People in 200+ years ago thought and reasoned and had the same emotions we have today.  The main difference was the times were more conservative and had more rigid moral and behavior expectations than we have today.  Our rules of behavior are so loose today in comparison.  Our reading material is not more interesting, just more risque.

",4.0,BrizeBooks,"Reviewed in the United States July 26, 2016","









  
  
    
  Pretty good book, sort of a nineteenth century chick-flick I think you'd say. It'll take you a little while to pick up on some of he language usage of the era, but you'll have that within a chapter or so.  To me the most challenging part was the complexity of the sentences at times, almost seems like they're having a competition to see who can come up with the longest, multi-part sentences that still make sense.  You get used to that after a while too, but at first I found myself going back to the beginning of a sentence and starting over as i was losing track of the commas and what goes with what.  They were all perfectly written, of course, just takes some focus.Character development was alright, though as I said, a little predictable, at least for the main characters.  I think I enjoyed some of the supporting characters more, a little more quirky and downright funny at times.  Also a good glimpse into the mores of the times (Victorian times I think) and obviously they put more emphasis on certain standards of behavior than is the case today (that I know of anyway)

",2.0,Geartrooper,"Reviewed in the United States May 19, 2014","









  
  
    
  I try to look at everything in an unbiased manner, even school assignments. Jane Austen has a way with words to make even the most humorous event seem boring and dull. She weaves words in such a way that makes me believe that every character is a robot with a pre-set plan. Even Mr. Collins who could be an exceedingly embarrasing and funny character just comes off as another tired asset to a book only hoping to increase its word count. Just because it is old doesn't mean it's a ""classic"". I have read many of Charles Dickens' books and found them delightfully entertaining, so while the writing style may have been different back then, that's no excuse for a book to be exceedingly dusty and dull. The only character that saved this book from getting one star was Elizabeth's father, who constantly torments her mother any chance he gets.

  Jane Austen was a great writer for her time, but enjoyable to read in this time as well. Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy epitomize the hidebound taboos and rules of that era.

  I love this audio version of the popular novel. I often play the CDs while I am driving and the time flies. Susannah York's animated reading of Jane Austen's novel includes voicing the lines of the various characters.

This rendition follows the book more closely, although it is an abridged version.

    This reproduction is lacking in quality.
  
",3.0,Brittany Wells,"Reviewed in the United States May 10, 2013","









  
  
    
  Note: I am reviewing this particular edition, not the story.Let me start off by saying that the original Hugh Thomson illustrations are beautiful, especially the peacock cover. However, this paperback reproduction is amateurishly laid out. The images (scans of a copy of the original hardcover from 1894) are generally low-quality. Most are grayish and slightly soft, not black and crisp-lined like ink drawings should be. At least one is horrendously pixellated (page 291, which is unfortunately and probably intentionally not in the 'Look Inside' preview). The cover is also very slightly fuzzy, although it isn't noticeable from a distance. It's lightly embossed like the hardcover, but you are not likely to notice unless you turn the glossy cover to the light. The edge of the front cover's image extends onto about a fourth of the spine, which reveals either messy laziness or the work of someone unfamiliar with laying out book covers.The text is 1.5x or 2x spaced, and there is a little room in the margins to write, which makes it a decent choice if you need to annotate it for class or something of that nature. The italics, oddly, seem to have been replaced with all caps. I can't say whether this is the way it was in the hardback or not, but it seems a little weird.Overall, I'm disappointed in the quality. I bought this as a gift, and I'm actually debating on whether to give it or not. At the price it's at right now, (about $19) I'd say skip it. It's definitely not worth that. Maybe $10. Maybe.

  Pride and Prejudice is a great read and Jane Austen is a gifted writer whose development of likable characters will be enjoyed for still more generations.

It's simply the best love story in this genre. This is a keeper because you will want to read it again and again.

  If you love Jane Austen and love Pride and Prejudice, this reading is as good as it gets and I have tried many. Josephine Bailey is first rate. Her inflections and tones are spot on for masculine and feminine characters. Appropriate for a classic book being read - not staged as a theatrical performance. I have heard other readings where the voices are overdetermined which only serves to detract from Austen's magnificent work.(Also of note Ms Bailey's fine voice would be pleasant to listen to if she were reading a cook book)Judy RoehlHolland NY USA

  this book is pretty incredible book but a bit long! Jane Austen's characters like Elizabeth Bennett, Mr. Darcy, and the bad lady Miss Bingley Jane all add to this complicated plot. Elizabeth Bennett is very well shown character, maybe the best ever written  This novel is an excellent example of Austen's literary power. Her ladies are to be admired for they marry for love not the social reasons. There is a lot of pressure in society to marry in your social class but love should be the main reason. Maybe the reason it seems a bit long is there are many characters, it is difficult to keep up with them all. Pride and Prejudice has to be read at least twice to catch everything and everybody. But it is an enjoyable read.

I really like the satin ribbon bookmark that is attached to the spine. I'd check out all of the novels in the mini gramercy collection and snatch up the titles you like. I hope they come out with more!

  I've been a fan of Miss Austen from day one; and I firmly believe that she has a bright future ahead of her as a novelist.Don't buy all the ""critics"" commentary and praise regarding ""Persuasion"" and some of her other works as being superior to P&P. That's pure contrary-ism at its worst.If you only read two of her books, then read this one twice. And then resolve to read more than two and check out her other novels, because they are great as well.The A&E miniseries for P&P is outstanding and comes highly recommended.No, I don't own stock in A&E; but I am over the age of 13... in a few weeks.

  What can be said about this classic love story that hasn't already been said? I could speak on the distinctive view of Austen writing about women in a male-dominated world, or the distinctive socio-economics discussed in the novel, or even of the basic tale of opposites attracting. But all of these things have been said or done in the thousands of reviews written about this novel over the course of the last 202 years, which just goes to show that all of the things about this novel can be summed up in one word: Timeless.

Obviously, this one is a classic, and if you can embrace the verbose nature Austen takes on and look beyond common use for some of the vocabulary, you will be delighted in a social commentary which still finds its place in the world of people today.

  I will not criticize Jane Austen's work and anything that makes her more  accessible in the pure (unabridged) form is to be praised.  BUT, please be  informed that this edition requires the tapes to be listened to on a player  with speaker balance controls!  If your player does not have this capacity,  or if the speaker in question cannot be turned off completely, this set is  useless.  Of my two cars, two portable players, and home stereo, only two  of them can play this edition.  So, this means that I drive that car even  more than I used to, and fold laundry more, whilst listening to this.

  Jane Austin is one of the best. However its a difficult read because of the terms and phrases they used but once you get the hang of the word usage, its a fast read as well. Romantic and one for the ladies. I think she could have been an advocate for womens rights in modern times. Her characters are loveable and remind me of stories my grandmother used to tell about her life as a young lady. She was born in 1893, so it was sometime later, but in some ways very connected to the social graces and lifestyles of the characters in this novel. I enjoyed it!

  The story itself may not be the most fascinating of all, but once understood in its own context, I doubt it will be hard to realize why it is one of the great classics of all time.I believe this book gained this status among other literary works by the skillful use of language and the details of the story that never cease to amaze the reader.Regardless of the story, reading this book was a delight and I am sure that anyone who enjoys reading will find this piece of work to be as enchanting and amusing of an experience as I thought it was

",3.0,Gayle,"Reviewed in the United States March 4, 2018","









  
  
    
  This is the first time in my reading life that I have ever picked up or even attempted to read a classic such as Pride and Prejudice. The expectation was high as it has been a long standing favorite in the literary world. I knew going in that I would struggle with comprehending the use of language, but it didn't deter me from reading it.I will say this, I did enjoy this novel, but found at times I just simply lost interest. My lack of interest didn't stem from the use of language, but more so to to with the fact that, that some scenes I simply found unnecessary. There were time that I found it over-written (if that makes sense) and I simply got bored.I will say I did enjoy Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy's story. I loved watching as their story unfold, from a love that was never going to happen, to a love that simply flourished.I also liked Jane and Mr. Bingley's story.Overall I enjoyed this read, but not sure how in this day and age it should fit into a school curriculum. I could almost conclude that while it's a long standing classic, more up to date reads should be implemented to keep young adults interested in reading.

  I saw the movie 1st, which is not my normal way. But I loved the movie so much, I figured I'd love the book. I do love it. I do have to admit that they way ppl spoke back in that day almost reminds me of Stephen King's books The Dark tower series when they talked about the ""high speech"". It takes a bit of getting used to. But the more I read, the better I loved. I normally am only into horror books so my love of this one is so wonderful to me.  Mr. Darcy is an ""upper crust"" rich man and Miss Lizzy is full of high spirits and she can't keep her mouth shut.  It didn't take long for her to hate Mr. Darcy.  Mr. Darcy of course fell in love with her. And so the love story goes.  It has no sex in it, no horror, no wars, and yet sure has enough to keep me coming about to this story every night.  Give it a try.

  Who couldn't love reading the language of that time without appreciating how much times and social mores have changed.  It was a struggle but worth the effort to interpret the meaning of the wordy phrases.  The plot was well developed and left the reader anxious to get the character's difficulties solved.  Good read it one has the patience to wade through the old-fashioned language.

  I loved the book, a well-known English classic, and felt compelled to give it a good rating. I do have one criticism of the eBook format for this particular edition. While I was reading through the book I noticed, more than 100 times, that the book was inappropriately formatted.  There were new paragraphs where no paragraphs should be (...Mr. (praragraph inserted) Darcy...),  this was only a minor distraction, but it did become a bit annoying, and it is an easy problem to fix. Paragraph insertion also took place between sentences, this became especially confusing with paragraph long dialogues.  Great book, but the formatting needs a bit of work

  I finally read this! This book has been on my mental to read list since I was a teenager. I have heard so much about it and the main characters, Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennett. The romance, Mr. Darcy, and blah, blah, blah. Now, don't get me wrong because I really enjoyed the book. I just think that a lot of people probably talk about it when they have not really read it. For one thing Mr. Darcy hardly says a word in the first half of the book and I found myself wondering...what romance were these people talking about and what is so great with Mr. Darcy when he barely talks. The second half of the book picks up and is way more entertaining. Mr. Darcy becomes more prevalent and endearing. Once finishing the book I now see that the first half was important to getting into the mind set of our feisty Ms. Bennett. This is definitely one lady I would not want to get into an argument with!

  I have read this book in the hard cover many times and watched the series many times as well. Reading on my new kindly was simply a delicious experience again. I can almost quote dialogue but still am totally absorbed by the plot/s each time. The selection of language used throughout the book is superb and sometimes makes me think I wish we still spoke that way. Shame so much swearing and slang has entered our english language, that maybe high school students should read it to learn a new selection of words, or to have it reinforced that there are thousands of delicious words out there that far create more meaning than slang! A classic and always will be.

  I loved the book! The illustrations I found to be a little odd because they were on non corresponding pages(in other words, they were out of context and spoiled the story a bit) so it might have been better without them. But otherwise it is great! Five stars :)

  ""Pride and Prejudice"" is a wonderful look at the customs of marriage, love, and financial and social status in Regency England.  It's message, that love is more important than financial gain, and that first impressions aren't always the best to base attitudes on, still ring true centuries later.

  I enjoyed this audiobook overall, but found the reader's voice a bit annoying.  I often found it difficult to focus on what it was that she was saying.  The other thing that I did not like was how many tracts were on a CD.  Each CD is divided into 100 tracks.  Great if your listening to it on the CD, but a nightmare if you want to put it on your favorite MP3 player.

  I was worried when I first started reading the book because my friend told me that it was slow paced. the courtship between two people was different back then than it is today so you have to be prepared for it. other than that small detail I completely loved the book. Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth are a great couple. I enjoyed it so much I read it again. if you are the kind of person to wonder how dating or romance happened then read this book; you will absolutely love the chemistry between the two.
