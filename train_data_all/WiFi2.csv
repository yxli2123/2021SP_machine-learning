  I don't think this did any good. The wifi network is still the same. The led light turned red because is farther away from the wifi. I don't understand what purpose this serves. I wanted to place this in my bedroom which is away from the router, but the red light turns on. I don't have many power sockets in the apartment to be ""halfway"" from the router. Fails to serve its purpose. $30 down the drain. Also, it is not that quick, it takes time to start. The network keeps dropping, turns red then green, and then red again pretty frequently. don't invest your money in this.

  I got a wifi extender for my Apple router. Very easy to connect. You simply download the app and follow the instructions/add the device on the app. Set up in about 5 min. I got one since two rooms require internet. Aesthetically, it looks great too which I like. I did a bit of research before buying an extender since I didn’t know which one would work with my Apple router. I just connected to the wifi I had already set up with router. Seamless connection. I actually ended up buying a second for downstairs. I just added the device to the same app. Make sure to get your phone close enough when u add it because the first time I did it, I still saw my first one but when I started over I was able to see the second extender. Also I recommended renaming the second one when you save the new connection. Connect the extender to your wifi with the wifi password, you’ll see both on your app. Happy with my purchase.

  This was the easiest installation I've ever encountered....and it works great !  I used the WPS method and had it operational in minutes.  My provider is XFINTY....I bought their 3 cube mesh extender and the install was a total nightmare. Range did not improve...and it switched over to 5.0G....and disabled all my 2.4G ""smart devices"". I had to purchase all new 5.0G outlets and reconfigure all my security cameras.. I bought the ""cubes"" directly from XFINITY and returned them and got my money back The TP-Link AC750 boosted my range by at least 50 feet. Best $30. I've spent in quite a while.....

  I bought this on a leap, really had no idea if it would work. I get terribly weak wi-fi in my bedroom (I have centurylink)Let me tell you I am beyond impressed, it takes minutes to set up the first time, after that it is quite literally smooth sailing. I do my sons distance learning in my room and was having to use the data on my cellphone because the tablet they gave him couldn't get a good signal, we plugged this in there and haven't had an issue since. If I unplug it for any reason I just gotta plug it right back in, I don't have to set it up again. Which is pretty cool. If you are looking around for a good wi-fi extender I really wouldn't look any further. Really, get this one. I can't really speak on how good the tech support is, but that is only because I haven't had a reason to contact them, which is wonderful.

  Having done my homework, I had a realistic idea of what speed I would get in the dead zone with my TP-Link extender. But the pleasant surprise is how the overall performance in that dead zone is dramatically improved even at what numerically looks like a slower speed compared to the 300 mb performance of my hardwired desktop. Setup was a breeze, which was also a surprise given the reputation of Comcast routers. But I really need to get a TP-Link router so I can enjoy a mesh setup and not have to switch networks when I go upstairs. Good product at a great price.

  I was skeptical about purchasing this and wasn’t sure if he would  be a waste of money or not but it is great. I installed a Roku tv in my garage which requires WiFi but my garage was too far from my router to get a good signal. I couldn’t watch anything without buffering. This fixed my issue. I put it about half way in between my router and my garage tv. Literally pressed a button on my router and plugged this in and it worked immediately. There was no installation. Took me all of maybe 60 seconds out the box and it was working. It’s like a miracle product really! Would 100% recommend and purchase again! If you’re skeptical, don’t be. Buy it! Well worth it!

  Although the red light shines steadily, indicating a weak signal, it was enough to keep from losing my streaming connection.  But barely.  On occasion there is still an interruption and reload.  I have a 4300 sq ft house which is probably a bit larger than this product is really set to handle.  If your house is smaller and the ranges are less, then this is a good product for the price.

  I have 600mbps internet and my router maxes at about 400mbps per device over wifi. In my garage we were experiencing buffering because it's the furthest from the router and behind 5 walls. It can handle 3 walls perfectly fine but adding 2 more when moving the office was too much. That 400mbps wifi per device from my router was dropped all the way down to 30mbps - which indicates very significant signal loss. Shows were buffering and Xfinity streaming app likes to shut off due to the iPad reconnecting every few minutes. Frustrating.I plugged in the TPLink RE220 and could not get any of my devices to retrieve an IP address from the device. It said it was connected to my router fine. After investigation I realized I was using a setting on my Netgear router that turn all 3 wifi signals into one name and the router will assign which band you're on. That was causing the issue. Turning off the option on the router immediately fixed the problem and now I have 60mbps+ wifi in the garage with both the Wifi Extender and iPad showing full signal on both devices. I was worried about the internal antennas not giving enough output buy it's essentially doubled my wifi range! They're on sale right now for $23! Anyone complaining that it doesn't work doesn't know anything about networking - or got frustrated and give up.

  So I live in a small apartment with thick walls. And my router is in a bedroom at the end of the apartment so my signal is horrible in the living room at the beginning of the apartment. So I wanted to try a extender to help with the signal. It works . Just not great. Put it mid way like directed and it seems like it’s still to far. (Remember my apartment is small) tried the kitchen. Not great. So it’s in the bathroom which is closer than the kitchen by maybe 7 inches. And it worked better but 2.4g is red and 5g is green . I still have slow WiFi . I guess I was expecting to much thought it would give me uninterrupted WiFi like in the room but hey something is better than nothing lol

",3.0,Peter Sivo,"Reviewed in the United States December 24, 2019","









  
  
    
  This was easy to install and provided additional signal to an area of the house that was weak however after multiple tests, my ~200Mbps download speed - when going through the TP-Link - drops off ~30Mbps to  ~60Mbps total bandwidth.  That seems excessive.  I turned off all 2.4Ghz to ensure I was only getting 5Ghz.  I then brought it into the same room as my router and using 2 laptops, connected either directly to my Xfinity WiFi Router (~200Mbps download, ~10Mbps upload) or the TP-LINK (~30 to 60Mps download, ~2 Mbps upload).  This was on 5Ghz, same room as the router with no interference.  So even though it provides a signal to remote areas of the house, the throughput drops off dramatically if that is an issue for you.  If not, then it works great in all other aspects.

  I have tried this extender in several different areas of the house. A plus is the app that can tell you if it's placed well (in a zone where the original wifi isn't optimal) but beyond that, it's a bust.  I have it in the entryway with a metal entry door, and the signal can't get outside.  I've had it in the back yard in the alcove with the water heater, and the signal only goes another 30' into the yard.  The alcove is made of wood, and has a metal door. It might work better if the signal can escape via a window or wifi-porous wall, but my house isn't set up that way.

  Do a speed test before then after you install this item.  You should see a difference.  Best way to get up and running is to download the app onto your Iphone.  Also, in Windows 10 bottom right your wifi symbol should see all lines full strength now.  Another way to get this device to work is to connect an Ethernet cable from your computer to the Extender.  Then in Microsoft Edge type in 192.168.0.254 to connect to it.  You may need to reset the the device by plugging a pin into it before you do this if you it was working and stopped working.

    Works pretty well, definite improvement over my U-Verse router
  
",4.0,L. Collins,"Reviewed in the United States December 26, 2019","









  
  
    
  I bought this device because my house has walls that eat WiFi signals. My main router is upstairs but most of my devices are downstairs. I have spotty and slow WiFi connectivity with my stock U-Verse router, especially downstairs. I installed this device upstairs near the U-Verse router but closer to the middle of my house. It actually did a nice job of giving me more stable WiFi connectivity. Instead of ""weak"" WiFi signals on my devices I now have average or good signal strength. I am much less likely to lose connection than I was before. In my case this device was a definitely improvement.The only complaint I have is that on occasion you have to power cycle the device. Several times I've had to just stop talking to my devices. The WiFi network it creates just goes away, but it comes back immediately after a power cycle. I go through this maybe once or twice a month. It may be inconvenient but I must say that it is still way better than the horrible connectivity I have without it. In the future I may buy a smart plug and have it schedule weekly power cycles at 4am.In short I can recommend trying this device if you have spotty WiFi connectivity. Like anything wireless there are no guarantees, however I can say that it does work for a number of users so don't be afraid to give it a whirl.

    Supports only a subset of all 5GHz WiFi channels
  
",3.0,J Yendor,"Reviewed in the United States November 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought the extender to use it in wireless client mode (often also called the media bridge mode), so that I can add a device that supports only wired Ethernet connection to the WiFi network.  It works, but not completely satisfactory, due to some undocumented limitations.1. The extender supports only some 5GHz channels but not others.  The extender cannot see the host AP on channel 64 (5320MHz), and I have to reconfigure the host AP to channel 48 (5240MHz) to be visible to the extender.  I am guessing that the extender lacks  DFS/TPC capabilities and thus cannot support channels 50-144.  If so, that excludes over half of the 5GHz WiFi channels in the United States.  This is a serious limitation and is not documented anywhere.2. There is no way to turn off Extended Network completely.  The RE230 emulator on TP-Link website shows that you can disable Extended Network for both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands.  On the real hardware, you must enable Extended Network for either the 2.4GHz or the 5GHz bands (or both).  The UI does not allow turning both off.Speed is satisfactory - I get ~70Mbps via 5GHz uplink, which is adequate for my needs.The second limitation probably would not affect most people.  But the first would affect all users relying on 5GHz uplink - the limitation should at least be documented on the datasheet.  If the extender cannot see your host AP on 5GHz, try moving the host AP out of the DFS/TPC channels.

  Super easy to get it to link to my router- it took maybe 3 tries to connect through the WPS.  But when I went to connect my equipment it didn't work.  It took me a few hours to troubleshoot it because all of the links and instructions were poorly written and didn't address the issue I was facing (therefore a poor rating on the technical assistance).  What I found out is that the feature called OneMesh, which allows for the extender to assume the same original password as the router, unfortunately is NOT compatible with my CenturyLink router.  I thought I had done my research adequately before buying, but I guess not.So I downloaded the app to manage the extender and had to find out what the factory password was.  Unfortunately it wouldn't let me modify the extenders original password.  The crazy thing was that the factory password was bulletproof because it was 50+ random characters, so entering in that code into all of my equipment connection settings was painstakingly time consuming.  But after 2.5 hours I finally am set up and operating!

  It failed miserably as a range extender. There was no meaningful gain in range. Much much worse, was the speed of its _EXT network. It was unbearably slow comparing to my original router network.

  I needed to improve WiFi in the family room, so I got one of these.  Works well and solved the problem at low cost.Background: we added a family room 12 years ago.  Because it's at the far end of the house from the office I ran an Ethernet cable from the office to the new family room and put a WiFi access point in the family room.  Time and technology made it obsolete, so when I put a new router (Netgear R7000) in the office 3-4 years ago I disconnected the access point.  WiFI in the family room was adequate for phone and email but not streaming video to smart DVD player or Roku.After doing a lot of research I decided my options were to remove the router and get a mesh network or put a new access point in the family room.  For $30 it was worth trying the TP-link 230.  Not as fast as the AC1200 or AC1900 devices, but for this it works very well.  It can be set up as a repeater or access point (which requires a wired connection, which I have).  It was a bit trickier to set up than the instructions imply, but the online manual helped.  Now the streaming works fine.

  I had a WIFI dead spot at the front part of my condo that I did not even know. I did not know this as I am always connected since my cell phone and Pad have 4G connection. I am on 4G connection while at the front part of the condo.  There was no signal in my guest room but since I seldom have guest staying, I was not aware of this.  Recently a friend of mine mentioned that I have a dead WIFI zone.  I checked it out and sure enough, he is right.I had a similar issue with my house which I solved with installing a Google WIFI system.  It works perfect.  A 3-Pack covers a multi stories 6000 sq. feet house.  I have 227 Mbps download all over.  I have about 220-230 Mbps in my condo.  Both internet provider is Spectrum (Different cities). Since my Linksys WIFI router in the condo is doing fine, I rather not spend $300 to get the newer Google Nest WIFI. Spending $30 to extend my WIFI is a no brainer option, so I thought.Here is the issue.  This device while named as an Extender is not an extender.  It does not act like a mesh system. This device has its own connecting ID.  That means your device would not automatically connects to it unless you change the WIFI connection.  So, having a consistent WIFI signal while walking around the condo is not what this device can do. It does solve my issue for my guest though.  I can now let them connect to this ‘Extender’ instead of my regular WIFI. At $30 this is a cheap solution.There are other issues with this device.  When connecting to it, the WIFI speed drops to about 140 Mbps when being close to it.  It would drop to 70-80 Mbps in my front part of the condo.  This is acceptable as the speed is still fast enough where I was not getting any signal before.If you are still with me after reading so much.  Here is a pointer.  Do not use 2.4 GHZ unless your device does not have 5 GHZ connection.  Set the Host Network using 5 GHZ and also use 5 GHZ for your clients’ connections.  The reason is using 2.4 GHZ would drop the WIFI speed down to 20-30 Mbps (in my case, your mileage might vary).If you are installing a new WIFI system or upgrading.  I suggested that you go with a mesh system.  This WIFI Extender does not really extend.  It provides another connection point with a different ID.Whether this device would work for you depends on your need.  It is not an ideal solution for me but it would do.BTW.  The setup was quite easy and fast.  I did spend more time on this as I was playing with all the settings and connecting with my varies devices.  If you have one, save some time and just use the 5 GHZ connections.

  My router is in our “bonus room” over our garage about as far as possible from our family room TV in a 3,000 sq. Ft. House. I was having big problems with buffering especially since I switched to an all App Based streaming service. Twice I rented movies on Apple TV which never did load. Decided I needed a WiFi Booster and saw a highly touted one that advertises heavily. But I read the reviews of WiFi extenders (or boosters - are they not the same). The TC-Link AC 750 WiFi Extender was the highest rated AND least expensive on CNET. It was on sale for $30 at Amazon and was a cinch to set up and easy to log on to - uses same name as my router plus -EXT and same password. I could never get WiFi signal on my iPad on our back porch - now I can check my email and use Google and Safari while outside. And......almost no buffering when watching TV.

    Great signal for top-floor office, easy setup
  
",5.0,Milli,"Reviewed in the United States January 24, 2021","









  
  
    
  Needed to boost the internet signal from a 7-year-old Fios Gateway router located at one end of the house on the 2nd floor, to a 3rd-floor office near the other end of the house. Was hoping to place the extender at an outlet halfway up the stairs (on the office end of the house), but it didn’t receive a strong enough signal from the router there. However, I was able to place it in a 2nd-floor bedroom at the other end of the house from the router, and directly under the office. It is sending a strong WiFi signal up to the office above. Devices are responding much more quickly with the stronger WiFi signal, and the signal seems strong and stable. If we need an even better signal for Skype or Zoom, we could easily run a longish LAN cord temporarily up the stairs from the extender’s ethernet port to the office.I am extremely pleased with this little device. For a very low cost and with a very easy setup, it has solved our connectivity problem that was preventing us from setting up a 3rd floor office. I appreciate the flexibility of having the ethernet port.

  It may work when the distance between it and the Wifi signal and the TV are pretty close, otherwise it's useless.  It wouldn't work when it was 20 feet away from my Wifi.

Kinda wish the ethernet port was on the side instead of the bottom and it's hard to plug anything else into the electrical outlet.

One is upstairs, CONSTANTLY having a signal loss on 2.4 & it's up in our loft further than the 1st one I set up that LOSES the 2.4 more than it has it. This is EXTREMELY frustrating as I have to constantly set up devices and that's gotten old real fast. Maybe one is faulty I don't know. I hooked the 1st, further known as ""_EXT"" wth the WPS system. The 2nd further known as ""_EXT Loft"" it found it right away in the app. I can sit outside on the deck watch YouTube, Vudu & Netflix in HD on my laptop or tablet & phone on 5. . But I NEED 2.4 and it needs to be constant. In our bedroom not far from _EXT and I'm resetting my LED strips & smart bulbs and now even Alexa every day pretty much. No excuse for this.  They came at the SAME TIME!! DID I GET A DUD?Update Aug 4:All the seller has done to rectify this is emailing me things to do to, all things I've tried. So I brought the working one downstairs to see if it was the location. Nope the working one is losing the 2.4 signal as well. My wifi app to check signal shows it's a great area to add an extender, but it's losing signal. Second one is a dud. Don't know how much more proof that is, so taking my 3 stars I have gone to a 1.

  This review is for use as a Access Point only. I bought this for use as a access point in my bedroom for phone use. I would get decent signal from the router located in another room, but there was always a lag. I installed this and wow what a difference! pages load fast with no delay. If you can get a Ethernet cable to the extender from your router this will set up a new WiFi signal that you can connect to and the back haul  to the router will be by cable, so very fast! You can rename the WiFi ssid if you like. I also turned off the 2.4 GHz signal as it is not needed, also lowered the 5GHz transmission power as I am only a few feet from the Extender and don't need full power to fry my eyeballs. You get a power choice of H,M,Low. I set it for low and signal is perfect for my bedroom use. My router is a VPN connected router and set up was a breeze. Also the set up app has many functions that you can change if needed, LAN, DHCP settings etc. also a WiFi detective to see whats all connected to your device. This device was money well spent, very happy with the purchase.

  I live in an apartment so unless we are close to the router, we struggle with wifi connection due to overlap with our neighbors wifi signals. We bought this so the wifi would extend from the living room to my office (again, not that far since we're in an apartment). However, every time I have to be on a zoom meeting, I try to take it from my office and end up needing to move to the living room because this device is just not extending the wifi good enough. I'm really disappointed the return window was so short because I was trying to give it a chance and by the time I realized it for sure isn't going to work as I had hoped, can no longer return. In a house without overlapping wifi signals, perhaps this extends fine. For me, I haven't noticed a difference since using this.

  tp-link Wi-Fi Range Extender AC750I orderded this range extender as our master bedroom is on the backside of our single story 2000 sq. ft house and has too much interference coming from the front room where our cable modem/router is located through the kitchen appliances to the master bedroom room. I use a combo cable modem + AC1900 router which works great for the rest of the house and worked great in our previous 2 story 3500 sq. ft house with no problems. We are on 100Mbps plan  and the speeds typically run about 112 - 115Mbps download in the rest of the house except in the Master bedroom & bathroom where they struggle to get even 1.9 Mbps speed on the 5 GHz channel due to the interference of appliances and mutiple walls. Hooking up the TO-link Wi-Fi Range Extender AC750 took about 15 minutes using option #3 which is setting up the extender intially next to your router via the WPS button on the cable modem/router. You do this 2x since once for the 2.4GHz channel and the second time for the 5GHz channel. It automatically assigned the two signals with 5GHZ_ext and 2.4GHz_ext as I have each channel listed as a seperate passcode/signal. It automatically assigned the passcode for each channel. After setting it up I let the extender run for about 30 minutes to make sure the signal stablized which might or might not make any difference.. I am very happy to report that signal now using the 5GHz_ext boasted the signal from 1.9+Mbps to 76 -80Mbps using Ookla's speedtest site for verification. The 2.4GHz_ext is running in the 35+Mbps range as well which is great as the normal speed is typically in the 45 Mbps range.

  Bought this to help boost the WiFi signal to our son’s room upstairs. It actually crippled our internet speed. Connect wirelessly to our modem, our devices will hold at 140mbps no problem. Switch the network to the TP-Link extender and it cuts it down to 40mbps. Same devices, same hardware, same distance, all we are doing is clicking the other access points (router vs extender). So, boosts the WiFi signal from 65% to 91% on the upstairs device but cuts the speed from 140mbps to only 40mbps. This garbage is going back.

  My problem was that my router's 2.4 Ghz signal had good coverage in my townhouse, but was clobbered during evening hours with competing signals from neighborhood routers.  My Roku TV's were constantly freezing.  The solution was to use 5 Ghz (a much less crowded frequency) but the higher frequency doesn't have nearly the range of the lower 2.4 Ghz.  After adding the TP Link extender between my router and the TV's, I now have a strong 5 Ghz Wi-Fi signal at each TV.  No more problems.  Simple solution.  Works like a charm.

However it doesn’t really do anything to help with my problem which is my bonus room upstairs.

    MAC address masking
  
",2.0,Michael Y,"Reviewed in the United States September 25, 2019","









  
  
    
  This Extender masks all MAC addresses that connect to it.  This means when a new client connects to the Extender, the REAL MAC gets added to the router so it can connect there, and the FAKE MAC gets added to the Extender so it can connect there.  This actually makes it worthless to me as the DHCP server assigns static leases based on MAC the address.  My router/firewall currently has about 50 known (allowed) WiFi devices.  That's an obnoxious amount of duplication.  Even if I'm not using the Access Control filtering on the Extender, it still masks the MAC to the DHCP server.  If the MAC masking was turned off when the Access Control is, then I'd give this 5 stars.Furthermore, after upgrading the firmware, all the FAKE MAC addresses got re-enumerated, which nullified all the previous allowances it entered in my Router/DHCP Server/Firewall so I had to start from scratch again.From the Extender's manual...""Q5.I have enabled wireless MAC filter, wireless access control, or access control list (ACL) on my router. What should I do before configuring the extender?When a device connects through the extender to your router, the MAC address of the device shown on the router is translated to another MAC address. If your router’s MAC filter, wireless access control, or ACL is enabled, the devices connected to the extender cannot get an IP address from the extender and cannot access the Internet.To solve this problem, please follow the steps below:1.Log in to your router and disable the MAC filter, wireless access control or ACL.Note: For more information about how to disable your router’s MAC filter, wireless access control or ACL, please refer to your router’s user guide.2.Power on your extender, and run the Quick Setup to configure your extender.3.Connect all of your devices to the extended network.4.On your router, add all the Online Devices’ MAC addresses to your router’s MAC filter table.5.Enable the router’s MAC filter, wireless access control, or ACL to complete the configuration.

  I just got it, so I can't comment on longterm reliability yet -- if problems emerge in that area, I'll revise this review. But I am very impressed by how easy it is to set up. I already have a TP-Link router, and I use their Tether app on my phone, so that probably makes things easier. But I bet it's pretty easy with other brands, too.Set up consists of plugging it in near your router and opening the app on your phone. It searches for the new device, and when it finds it -- about a minute later -- it asks you for a network password (the one your router uses) and a new network name. It suggests networkname_EXT, but you can make it whatever you want. Once it links up with your router -- about another minute -- and all the signal lights go white, you unplug it and plug it in somewhere midway between your router and the area of your house that needs better service. Another minute or two, and if all the lights go white, you're done.Some reviewers seem to have gone wrong with this last step. They choose a position for the extender that is out of range of the router. Of course, this won't work. The extender needs to receive a strong signal in order to extend it. In my house, somewhere around 40ft from the router seemed to work best.

  Living in an apt is hard to modify the place and wired it. I have the router on living room and one of bedroom the signal would drop around the room. Was thinking about wiring but found this extender and works great!!.Install took 5 seconds. Out of the box and plug into an outlet. Simple enough. Download the tp link app to setup and again took only couple of mins as long as you follow the app prompts. It creates 2 other ssid (if using both 2.4 and 5ghz signals) called same as ur current wifi but with Ext at the end. During setup you disconnect from ur wifi and connect temporarly to the extender then you can choose which one to connect to. Also simple to check what clients are connected to it.Its recommended to put between the router and the dead zone. Remember the weaker the signal it recieves the weakest will transmit is not a magic box, keep ir in mind while deciding where to install. Speed is great and now finally whole apt is covered. Definitively will get more when we move to a bigger place.Note: sometimes ur device will switch wifi ssid automatically but like our apartment sometimes it doesnt, if your speed start slowing down always check to what device you connected to.

  My bedroom is a wifi dead zone in my house. It doesn't matter how good my router is, I will frequently lose connection altogether or get a really weak signal.I put this extender about half way the distance between the dead zone and my router and the connection is amazing. I rarely lose connection. I generally have two or three bars compared to one bar. Most importantly my bandwidth speed is anywhere from three to eight times as strong as it was without the extender.What I really love about the extender is the meshed network. Meaning I don't have to connect to a different wireless network for the extender. It is all one network. So if I move throughout my home I'm always on the same network. I don't have to disconnect and reconnect as I go between rooms. For those of you who have used older extenders who made you log into a separate network you know how frustrating this can be.This thing was only thirty bucks and it has saved me so much stress and time. I would highly recommend it for dead or weak wifi zones.

  I bought these to complement my Xfinity modem/wifi router and provide a boost of signal upstairs in my bedroom where my iPhone's signal drops. The setup of this was very easy and simple; it took me maybe two minutes.The downside is that this thing in isolation from their mesh product does NOT offer simply a relay/booster signal. In isolation, you have to create a new SSID for these, eg if your home wifi is MyInternet, this would create a MyInternet_EXT. So you have to connect to a second SSID, which is fine except if you're like me where when you walk downstairs and you're closer to the main wifi, my phone is still trying to stay connected to the _EXT upstairs, so its signal is much weaker.So yeah, these would be great if they could seamless boost my existing signal, and for $30 I didn't lose a lot of money, but do your research first and find something that can simply emulate your existing wifi SSID, not require you to create a second SSID.

  Bought this to try and extend wifi from a main house on my family's property to my house approximately 200 yards away. Works good for what a paid for. It was just enough to capture the main wifi from the main house, which has a different booster in it, and relay that signal through my approximately 1500 sq ft house. It will cut your speed from the main wireless router but for the $20 something I paid for it, I am pleasantly surprised that it could grab the main wifi signal from so far away. As a disclosure, there are really no visual obstructions between the houses so this could be why it worked for me at this distance. The setup was very simple and required little to no technical knowledge of wifi systems. For the low price, I recommend trying it if you are in a similar situation as I was. If you want anything with better signal boosting capability, you will have to shell out the $100s for a mesh network.

  Very easy to install but like all WIFi extenders it suffers from the same short comings. The WiFi extender has its own SSID, separate from the main router SSID. This creates a problem, if the device is connected to the main router, it will remain connected to the main router even if the signal is very weak rather than switch to the stronger repeater signal. This creates an unstable network.I switched to a mesh router system (TP-link deco M5), cost is more but the signal is strong, stable and works. In the long run its more cost effective than buying multiple wifi extenders.

  Once you have the extender installed and up and running, it works just okay, not great. Half the time it doesn't work great though. The product has just decent range, but nowhere near 1,200 sq. ft. as advertised. Speeds are also nowhere near 750 mbps, and I think this product actually has lowered my WiFi speeds, at least some of the time. It struggles to extend signals beyond certain walls and hallways, and dead spots persist. For some reason, the connection to my Roku TV gets dropped at least once per day, usually in the evening, but only for a few seconds. That's kind of annoying. I'm also getting slower speeds and more intermittent signal loss as time goes on.Installation is a pain, and it took me two tries over about 45 minutes to an hour to set up the Wifi connection with the extender following the directions. At first, I couldn't get all four lights to light up and couldn't get the 5 GHz to connect. I had to completely unplug the extender and restart the installation steps from the beginning, but with a little patience it worked.Generally, I'm not too happy with this product. It works okay some of the time.

Now I don’t know if delivering fast speeds like it say it does but it’s not there to say the less so I did two tests one is about 5 ft away from my router and then another 5ft with a Ethernet cord and another 8ft away with and without enternet cord so5ft with no cord on 5Ghz : 91.37 up and down is 18.06 and a ping of 64 ms now it spikes up and down and results in me getting pocket lost so I would play cod and there would be a person in front of me the time I start to engage I’m already respawing5ft with cord : 20 up and 15 down and ping stay roughy 80ms to 120ms10ft with no cord : main router : hey um I’m sending this information to you can you Reach me? Over ?Repeater: *Lost signal* constantly requesting information then crashes*10ft with cord : Router : Hey are you getting this information?Repeater: *Has a StokeSo it was a point where I had to disconnect it and reconnect to the router and it would just drop constantly. My provider is spectrum and the up is 500 and the down is 200 on our router so I don’t know if I’m doing something wrong or maybe I’m trying to much into it ... and my home router is a net gear night hawk and it has it own little armor protection thing and it keeps notifying me about Potential high jacking idk. I tried to use the new Xbox stream thing as well and it’s just crashed my internet so I don’t know if I’m doing anything wrong but this is my take on this device :)

  I needed to extend our wifi signal from the basement to the other side of the house and outdoors, on the deck and patio. I had bought a previously used unit that was DOA, then found this one (right before it went on sale - oh well...) on Amazon. Setup seemed like it would be easy, but took a little futzing as I moved it into different outlets, trying to decide which one provided the best coverage while still getting a solid signal from my router. After going back-and-forth a few times, hitting the reset button on the router a couple times (and on the unit) it finally connected to the network and I was able to set it up as an extended access point using the phone app.Since then, it's been working with no problems, and has solved any connectivity issues I might have had in parts of the house/yard that were more distant from the original router. A good range extender - available at a lower price now than when I bought it.

  Setup was pretty easy and after testing 3 different outlets found the one with the 'best' placement between the wifi router and my bedroom where the wifi signal is the weakest.  Initially it seemed like the extender was going to work but about an hour later my tablet started acting weird and constantly losing connection to the extender.  Reconnected it to the main wifi and things returned to normal.  At this point I was concerned that the extender was not going to be working so installed the Ookla internet speed test application and in 5 minutes tested the speed on the Main and the Main_Ext in my bedroom multiple times(the area with the weakest signal).  Main internet speeds were 150+ and the extender was in the 20's even though it's signal was the strongest(see attached image).Unplugged the extender, plugged it back in and the results did not change.Currently returning the extender for a refund.

  This is the second repeater I bought. The first one which is an earlier version works perfectly and deserves a 5 rating. This one never worked. When I first installed it, it connected to my my TP-link, in use, rather than my router. I would never have known this but I downloaded the Tether App, which made me aware. I fixed that by changing the connection. Next, I changed the name fro _EXT to my router's name. It shut my Wifi down. I unplugged it, Wifi back working fine. Plugged it in again, Wifi goes down again. Getting tech support takes up too much time so I decided not to. I am extremely disappointed in this product, compared to the earlier version.

  I got this because in my apartment building, there are thick walls, presumably constructed from steel and concrete.  This makes it difficult for a strong signal to make it from my living room to my bedroom (about 4-5 walls over a span of about 30 feet.  My WiFi signal strength was fine from the ISP, so I installed this device at a midway point.  Long story short, it worked.  It's not the strongest signal booster, and you do need to create a separate signal ID and password setup.  However, I stream videos and games without issue most of the time.  On very rare occasion the signal has been weak enough that it has disrupted viewing (low res, error in Fire stick, etc.).  I would recommend it to anyone, having not further explored other devices of its kind.  It is reliable and very easy to setup.

  I was really counting on this to work but after installing this (easily BTW) and trying a couple of locations per the instructions, I shockingly got half the speed as I already had without the device on a different floor of my home. I bought this upgraded device to get up to 700 (since I usually get 600-800 on the floor the router is on and 200-300 on the separate floor). Unfortunately, I am only getting 100 when I usually get 200-300 without it. Although it did help with the reach to one additional area, the speeds being half as much as without it is counterproductive. Perhaps it is the home construction, but I have to return this.

It downloaded and installed automatically via the web utility.  Then it rebooted and never worked again.NO Wifi signal generated, No LEDs besides the solid power light, NO RESPONSE TO THE RESET BUTTON. Device is bricked.45 minutes with the chat support later, and I was told to get an ethernet cable to try connecting that way - so the tech could drop off the chat while I was gone.

  Looking for a WiFi device to replace my Ethernet over power line setup in an outdoor application. This one foots the bill nicely.-very easy to setup using one of three options listed on the menu.-many potentials for this little device, a WiFi extender, WAP, or extending wired network for my case.-very appealing design. I take advantage of its small size by housing it with a POE injector in a small utility box. I can see it’s appeals for indoor applications.-good WiFi signals for its size. I only use one way receiver to connect my wired devices. Never drop any connections over 30feet over walls for few weeks now.-My only complain is the status page doesn’t show the devices it connect over the wired port. It might set you off during initial setup. Once I know the limitations, I rely on my router for the status of extended devices.Great value. The new vision will not work for me due to the the location of the wired port inside the utility box.

  The product works great. After it was set up, I plugged it into a wall socket on the 2nd floor next to the Chrome book and now the Wifi signal is strong. I also set up my Desk Top and printer via the same device. It definitely made a huge difference in the strength of the Wifi signal. However, I could not do the setup myself ( which there are three ways to set it up). Nothing I tried worked. So much for the 5 min set up! I ended up contacting T-Link via chat which in turn, they had someone call me to help me with the set up. That became a 3-4 hour adventure with the Technician(s) to get it done. Which in turn cost me $199 to get it accomplished because the laptop I was using had over 966 ""intrusions"" and was also infected with a virus. So they had to do a thorough PC cleaning and finally install the T-Link device. Believe me it wasn't a easy install for them either. They definitely had a challenge on their hands but were finally able to get the job done. So don't rely on the Microsoft free programs such as ""Windows Defender"",  fool you into believing your PC is protected from everything, because it doesn't. But now I have a good clean PC supposedly protected from everything - anywhere, via a 365 day ""Anti-Every-Thing"" Anti-threat program. I suppose all in all it was worth the $199 for the PC cleaning, getting rid of the virus and getting this device installed. I mean how much would it have cost just cleaning up the PC, getting rid of the Virus and all straight from your home!

  First of all, these are range extenders not signal boosters.  Whatever signal strength the unit receives  from your router will be same strength the unit transmits.  If the signal strength it receives from your router is weak, so will be the strength of the extended signal.  It will boost the range of your router, not its strength.  ""Garbage in, garbage out"" applies.The smart TV we have by our pool always displayed the internet strngth as ""weak.""  After I plugged the  AC750 WiFi Extender into an outlet about midway between my router and the TV, the signal strength improved to ""good.""  Good is good enough for me.Set-up was seamless.  I used the WPS button on my Linksys EA6350  router and the unit did the rest, picking up all 4 router networks and adding a -EXT extension to each  resulting in a total of 8 networks.  Password for the AC750 is the same as for the Linksys network.  I did need need to use the tether app or a web browser to set it up.All in all, I'm quite pleased.

  Amazing performance for any price, let alone for 30 bucks. My router is on the third floor of my house. I placed this in the kitchen on the first floor and the WiFi signal, even the 5ghz band is a full 5. I bought a second one and put it in the basement. Again, excellent reception. Such performance at such distance through 2-3 floors is remarkable. The unit is tiny and just plugs into an outlet. Set up is the usual process: plug it into an outlet next to your router, press your router’s WP button, then the extender’s WP button and wait till both acquire signal for both the 2ghz and 5ghz bands; then unplug the extender and plug it into an outlet wherever you need the boost, and wait till all the lights light up steadily and you are all set. Remember that on your device, whether phone, tv, iPad, etc. be sure to check that the extender’s wifi is selected, which is your network name that has an “EXT” after it. I also have one of the top end TP Link extenders that was quadruple the price and didn’t provide half the reception as this one (its 5ghz band stopped working). There are no cons to this product that I have seen so far. How long it lasts, however, is unknown since I’ve only had it for 2 weeks. If it fizzles out in a year I’ll revisit my review. In the meantime, I can’t imagine anything else outperforming this for anywhere near the price.

Luckily the instructions are written in plain English, if only I could read it. I did not even have to go to tech support to correct my oops. the instruction pages are that easy to use.

However with the ROKU that's plugged into it and using it's internet connect instructions it found it first try in less than 5 seconds. Go figure! I'd buy this again if needed and would suggest it for seniors. Price, install ease and operation are for us older generation that's having trouble keeping up with the new technology.Okay, it's been plugged in for 2 months now. I've been able to connect to it from my shop with a 15 year old Compact computer with a NetGear N150 extender through four walls with blown in paper insulation at a distance of about 150 feet and a 15 foot wide cedar tree. Granted I get no more than 2 bars and sometimes on windy days it loses signal completely. Compare this with the same setup in my shop and cut the distance through the same cedar tree, two insulated walls and only about 110 feet and I get one or two bars to my CenturyLink WIFI modem. Facts give this 5 stars. And this on only service available to us and it's a poor 3 Mbps speed internet. Don't get me wrong though, if your in the country and the only thing you can get is satillite internet this won't improve latency and give you streaming video. This is great but only for range!

On my cell phone I have a wifi signal measuring app as well as walked away from each (installed almost side by side) and kept checking signal. The tp-link seemed to work well (harder to set up) but lost signal 50' from the unit. The Dlink worked up to 100' away! And it still works perfectly. Whereas the tp-link has lost contact with the router twice and needed to be reset as from new.

  I’ve got AT&T wireless internet. The service is awful. Had to reset router a few times every day. Response on desktop attached to Ethernet port was the worst I’ve ever experienced.For $30, I installed this extender. Install was super easy....15 minutes. Worked immediately. I assigned wireless printer and two Roku devices to this unit and all work better than without it.The tv still cycles from time to time but recovers quicker than without this extender.So, for $30, I’m reasonably happy. Again, the major issue is AT&T with a download speed of 1.7 mbps....believe that??? Horrible.So, given what I have to work with, the extender is doing its job. It helps but does not solve the issues. Makes them more tolerable.

  There are two rooms in my sister's house that get no coverage. My room when I stay there and the living room.  This house is probably around 2,000, 2,300 square feet. It is made out of concrete (it is in Puerto Rico).The setup took a few minutes and it was pretty easy. I looked up the app because I could not get the iPhone to recognize the QR code. Once setup was completed, I relocated the extender to the second floor hallway, right in between the bedroom that has the modem/router and my bedroom.Prior to the extender, I had 1 wifi bar in the edge of the bed in my bedroom. There was no signal in the living room and we could never get the tv in the living room to connect. The TV in the living room works great now.We now have 2 WiFi bars in the living room and my bedroom. Very happy with this extender. Works great.

  4 stars because Ethernet connection is not faster than the wifi speed it provides and slower than wifi speed sometimes. otherwise it does its job for what you pay. i get better speeds on my phone then i used to with being away from the main router. i get 43.1mbps down from the main router when i'am at two bar signal and 92.4mbps from the extender which is doubled the speed. My laptop doesn't benefit from it as much, my ps4 gets 10mbps down and with the extender it gets up to 60mbps. its not perfect but I recommend it for the price and functionality combo. easy to install, didn't come with any cables.

  The first week of using this wifi extender, it worked beautifully and the set up was so easy. The wifi signal was definitely hitting the section of my house better. THENNNN!!!! A month later it somehow made the wifi..... WORSE? I was connected to the extension but the wifi wasn’t working so I turned it off and just went back to using the regular. I.E.: I was lagging on the game like crazy as it was connected to the ethernet cord to the extender, so I switched it back (no longer using the extender) and didn’t lag as bad as I did using the TP-Link. Later, it came the mac AND my phone. So, there ya have it. Junk.

  This product doesn't accomplish anything for me.  I'm trying to extend my wifi out to my garage, but the extender needs to be placed so close to my host wifi router, and has a weaker signal than my router, that it does nothing to extend the bubble of wifi coverage, I get equally good (which is very spotty) coverage from my main wifi router.  What I really don't understand is why the extender can't be placed further from my main wifi router.  I plug it in an outlet in my bedroom, from which I have 0 issues streaming HD netflix on my phone or computer, but it can't connect from that location, and gives me the red wifi signal.  Furthest I can get it from the router and show green is like 25 feet, while my phone and computer can go much further.  If it could be placed further away, where other devices can still connect, and/or broadcast a greater distance itself it could be of use, but it seems to do nothing.Also really did not like the conditions of information sharing on the App they try to get you to download.  I would not recommend using that app and sharing all your information with them.

  I have 400 mbps service and was seeing speeds of 7 to 35 from this extender. It is also unreliable in that it disconnects from wifi several times a day and even multiple times within a single hour. The problem was isolated to the extender as all my devices were seeing 300+ mbps when connected directly through the router or plugged in to the modem. I contacted Amazon and they said I could return the product but would charge a restocking fee. A restocking fee on a defective product?? I guess they have a fee now if they have to throw something in the trash when they receive a defective product back from the customer.

  The wifi extender was easy to install.  I like the fact that it creates two -ext wifi networks, one at the higher speed 5ghz and another the slower 2ghz speed.  My router puts out 300mbps wifi  On the Extender, I get 25mbps with the 5Ghz -ext network and 5 mbps on the 2ghz -ext network, all at areas of my house where my router's wifi can't reach.  Transition between the various wifi networks is seemless.  However, when I return to a part of my house where I can utilize my router and 300mbps speed, I have to manually switch from my -ext network to my router network.  Although I wish I could get faster speeds on the 5ghz -ext network, I think that the 25mbps speed is adequate.

",2.0,Eric C,"Reviewed in the United States May 20, 2020","









  
  
    
  The strength of the signal in my home was increased and I was able to maintain 3 bars on my iPhone 11 Pro in the area of my home where I struggled to maintain a good signal. The issue I had was that my Netgear nighthawk r7000 and the tp-ac1750 (tested independently) would not reach cellphones and small devices with full signal downstairs in my home.I have been using the TP-AC1750 exclusively while waiting for the extender to come in and was pulling down 300mb with full signal (laptop, and cellphone), and 40-70mb with 2 bars on mobile, 120mb on laptop. My plan provides up to 300mbps from Comcast.I set up the extender as close to the upstairs route as I could while still servicing my deadzone. Everthing was working on my phone and laptop perfectly - full signal. However, my phone was only pulling between 30-60mb. Even worse my laptop only pulled 30-60mb as well. The best I could do was positioning my phone right against the device and I could get 90mbps.This speed drop is total junk if you're paying for a boosted internet speed. I've just ordered the upgraded model of this device and will report back when I have that installed and tested.TLDR:Will create higher signal saturation, but might cost you a lot of speed. Would not recommend if you want a speed higher than 45mbps.

  Easy set up, took about 10 minutes....extends what you have, no it does not provide MORE internet, or FASTER internet, it is just extending the existing radio signal to areas that were blocked of obscured from the existing signal.  Yes, truthfully and scientifically it can not provide 100% of what it receives to the new extended area for perfect saturation, but since I had dead spots in the home prior to this, this has filled the gaps with a use-able signal.  It has a open network cable port on its underside so you can actually (also) plug a device into it.  Recommended and well worth the price.  Joe

  The device does its job, but not well. I'm using it to extend the range of my Archer A7, which is a gigabit router. However, this is not a gigabit device, so it will already slow down the max speed. Once you factor in distance and the second-hand wifi, I got at most half the speed of my primary router.Set was was easy, except it only worked as a repeater rather than a Onemesh system. I didn't realize I had to upgrade my Archer A7 firmware first. Once I upgraded, Onemesh worked fine and combined all the networks into one.I would not recommend using this to extend wifi into a primary device like a laptop. You're not going to get great speeds for video conferencing of streaming. However, this would be great for extending wifi to low-bandwith devices like wireless printers, wifi speakers, smart thermostats, etc. This device is more for extending range over preserving speed.For faster speed, I would either get a better router with better range, or a dedicated mesh system where the router and repeater are equal quality.

They will only show the power light and nothing else after I power them back on.  This is highly disappointing considering everything worked so well in the beginning and I did not move my main router or the extender locations to cause this problem.

  The limitations regarding Arlo Video Doorbell NOT being 5G Incompatible lead to me purchasing the TP-Link AC750 WiFi Extender .My Townhouse was built in ’63 .  Structural factors of going through glass and brick with my REAR doorbell were DEFINITELY a problem.  I connected the FRONT doorbell without making ANY changes to my Wi-Fi or iPhone, ( iPhone connected to 2.4G/5G “Meshed” Wi-Fi ).After initially connecting REAR doorbell with 5G “Meshed” Wi-Fi, it worked fine for two or three days.  After it became “Disconnected”, I was able to remove/re-add four or five times.  Then, after going through the “Add New Device” many times, the Arlo App on my iPhone never “Found” my REAR doorbell.  After going through ALL the documentation, I decided I had to really make every effort to ensure the REAR doorbell was definitely using 2.4G Wi-Fi, (NOT 5G) !For me, this meant:1. Un-meshing my Wi-Fi into separate 2.4G and 5G bands on my Comcast/Xfinity Router.2. Installing the TP-Link AC750 WiFi Extender downstairs within 15 feet of the REAR doorbell.3. Linking the TP-Link AC750 WiFi Extender to BOTH 2.4G and 5G Wi-Fi.4. Reconnecting all my other devices to the new Un-meshed 2.4G and 5G Wi-Fi bands, (Alexa, Printer, Laptop, etc… ) .5. Connecting my iPhone to the 2.4G-Ext “Extended” Wi-Fi band .6. Going through the Arlo App “Add New Device” on my iPhone, which after 10 or 20 times is still super annoying, it’s probably 20 screens of buttons and swiping to get to the point where it generates the QR-Box for the Arlo doorbell Camera to scan.My REAR doorbell is now operational, and working as expected.

  This extender just proves once again why TP-Link is the best company out there for Wi-fi products.  If you aren't familiar with the set-up of an extender, etc. then read the quick installation guide first before you do yours.  I would suggest to d/l the ""Tether"" app via the playstore or app store, before you start the set-up process for your device.  Make sure to place the device within a foot or so of your router, then when you're done you can move it where you would like to place it on a more permanent basis.  If you use the tether app, this is all laid out for you in a step by step fashion.  It literally ""holds your hand"" and walks you through it.  There are three Modes, or ways to set it up.  I always find that if I can set it up using an app, then the easier it is with not as many problems.  As far as any problems or issues with this device...well, not so much.  Actually I had no problems at all with the set-up of it.If  you're thinking about getting this, I would suggest it.  Coverage with the 220 is OUTSTANDING!! It also has some tools that will make the process of using it even better and/or easier.Good luck with whatever device you plan on using. If you purchase the 220 then You have plenty of easy/fun times ahead!!!!  Good Luck.Ron G.(P.S. I apologize for my pic...no matter what I do when I transfer the pic to this page, it will never straighten up.  In my gallery the pic is correct, so I'm unsure of what's going on)

  We have Xfinity and our house is mostly an open floor plan except for a couple bedrooms in the rear.  Our kids were getting some serious 'Lag TIme' during their video games so we though an extender would do the job. Unfortunately Xfinity only sells them in Bundles of 3 for 120.00!!  So we tried this ONE from TP-Link and it works great!! Saved a bundle too!!

    Does the job! Extends wi-fi to detached garage 40 ft from house (60+ ft from router)
  
",5.0,Brian G,"Reviewed in the United States November 26, 2020","









  
  
    
  Wanted to connect to wi-fi from garage workshop to the router in house (Linksys I think) so, plugged this in an outlet upstairs closest to the garage, and voila! I get wi-fi out to the workshop! - It was very easy to set up (from the main computer station next to router) although I do speak passable geekish, so, might be challenging for less technically inclined.. But once it was set up, unplugged it and moved it to the outlet where it was meant to sit, and got usable wi-fi to the workshop (3-4 bars usually, depending on what weather is like outside and whether shop door is open or closed but it can vary) - worst case, it does have latency (so big files and youtube videos, images, etc can take a while to load, if they load at all) but, crappy wi-fi is better than no wi-fi at all! So, for the price and ease of setup, I am a happy camper!

  The wifi extender worked okay for a couple of months.  Then it stopped working.  I called Amazon and they said I needed to call the company.  I did and after many attempts with the tech person, it was determined that the item should be replaced.  I was to send photos and proof of purchase and they would replace the item.  I did all that was requested.  That was in early November.  I never heard from the company again.  I do not want the extender replaced at this time.  I have since changed my internet service and have a strong wifi signal.  I would appreciate a refund for this purchase.

  I purchased this to help boost the WiFi signal reaching my outdoor security cameras. It's too early to tell if that part of the mission has been fulfilled, but the initial setup was a breeze. I used both the printed quick start guide as well as the mobile app walkthrough to get the device up and running, then relocated to the ""dead zone"" (really just the front of my house) with little to no trouble. I am still using the rented modem/router combo from my cable provider, but that didn't seem to be a problem at all. As others have noted, a separate ""EXT"" version of your WiFi network needs to be created, but I actually don't mind that, since only my cameras will be using the extender network and I actually like having them on their own. It's early, but as long as the signal provided to the cameras is improved, I would say this is a great purchase.

    Rough start but now works perfectly
  
",5.0,JRiley,"Reviewed in the United States January 12, 2021","









  
  
    
  I bought this extender due to the reviews I read on Amazon.  It's a slightly older model but it was inexpensive and I had hopes that it would help with the streaming problems on my Smart TV.  Our internet is supplied by satellite so it's rather expensive and we try to work with a lower data limit.  Most months we run out of data within 2 weeks and have to settle for a much slower signal than we want but have settled for due to cost.  We've always had a problem with streaming from Netflix, Prime, and other apps.  Even when our signal is 25 Mbps or more, we spend more time watching the little circle as it buffers over and over again than watching the video.  It often becomes so annoying we switch back to standard TV. My thought was that with an extender  I could hardwire to the TV utilizing the network set up by the extender.  There were some difficulties setting it up as I was trying to use my desktop as the main control.  There is no PC App for the tether I needed and I was trying to workaround to get it for my PC by using an emulator.  It didn't work.  Nor did my android phone work.  After a frustrating couple of days, including time on the phone with TP-Link's support whom I can't fault though they didn't solve the issue, I finally remembered my Android tablet, downloaded the appropriate tether, and had everything up and running in minutes with no further problems!Hardwiring the extender to the TV works perfectly.  I now almost never have to wait out multiple buffering and it doesn't seem to matter what the download speed is from the satellite.I would recommend this extender from TP-Link as a possible solution to your buffering problems.

  This product is phenomenal & the price is great! I had several WiFi dead spots & limitations on the range of service in my place & this extender is perfect. My WiFi is super fast & available in every part of my home now. The only negative thing about the purchase of this product is on the paper instructions. There’s 3 different set-up options and the first choice to download the app. is the best one, but it wasn’t specific enough if you’re not knowledgeable on your tech lingo. Basically, when the app asks for your 2.4 GHz host network then the next step asks about your 5GHz host network, the instructions should clarify where you can find that info. Otherwise, they should make it understood that it may be the same network & at this point you can “Skip” trying to locate the 5GHz info. and hit “Next”. I spent a lot of unnecessary time trying to manually enter info. from my internet provided modem, my personal router & the WiFi Extender’s info.  But even though I was frustrated by the time I figured out they were the same login I use for my internet provider, I can admit it was at least worth it.

  The device was reasonably easy to set up with the iPhone app.The broadcast signal strength is a bit week. The real weakness seams to be that while the device can do both 2.4GHz and 5GHz, it uses one band to receive and the other to send. This means that either way, you are limited to 2.4 GHz speeds.

  We ordered the WiFi Extender because the signal to our front door's Ring doorbell was too weak for it to operate with our router located upstairs in the back of the house.Setup was rather straightforward. Following the instructions, I first up the extender when in close proximity to the router (both 2.4GHz and 5GHz bands), then moved the extender downstairs to the front of the house, where the Ring doorbell and other devices now have high connectivity.I was initially wary the the extender had different network names than the original router (the original name followed by ""_EXT""), but once I set up my devices to also allow usage of those networks, it has not been a problem at all.

  First surprise was that this device will broadcast as a new SSID (unlike my prior unit). Not a deal killer. And maybe a plus if you need to troubleshoot. But, the signal is not strong enough. The measured signal of my existing wifi was -60ish. Not enough for my needs. So I installed this maybe 50 feet from my AP. And I was disappointed to see that the new SSID was actually weaker than the signal from my AP. After relocating the unit, it did the job. It's compact and fairly easy to setup. Perhaps the tiny size and lack of antenna is the reason for the weak signal.

  I read a lot of reviews about repeaters/extenders and chose this device over a Netgear model. Set up was very easy via the app and also even easier if you have a router with a push button WPS.I tried setting the router up with this repeater both ways. It recognized both bands from my router.I was trying to extend my WiFi signal into an upstairs garage apartment about 50 feet from the room the router sits in. The signal dropped to nothing almost when I got outside the garage. In the upstairs apartment I could get a weak signal. Speed test said it was 17 mbs upload and 10 mbs download. In my house in all rooms I can get 70-80 mbs download and around 20-30 mbs upload.My chrome book could actually get close to the same upload/download speed connecting to the weak signal from my router as I could get connecting wirelessly to this extender right next to it.Now to be fair this was only $30 and also my home was built in 1952 with plasters and lathe walls and is all brick so that is a lot of material to get a wireless signal through. I will end up probably putting this extender out in the back screened in porch to give a stronger signal for WiFi when out there and order a more expensive model and try it instead. You get what you pay for.

Currently I am working from home (well, taking a break to write this review) and streaming Netflix in the back of the house, while my husband plays Xbox and probably checks his phone a million times in the front of the house. Awesome connection, no delays or buffering at all. My only issue was some slight trouble setting up, because the app didn't work and I had to try and do it through the site. One issue was completely my mistake but it wasn't quite as smooth of an install as the instructions made it seem even discounting that.

Nothing about this product was worth the hour I spent trying to even get connected to it. I received it today, and I am returning it today. I'll buy something else.

  this extender kept dropping the signal, it showed that it extended the signal from my router but would constantly drop it. I had this setup to extend the signal to use with my ROKU in a back room. It is a super easy setup, 5 stars there. Got the new extended network all configured into my ROKU TV, turned it on and started watching. Awesome! 15 minutes later I get the spinning thing on the screen, it comes back but then about 20 minutes later it does it again. I tried it on both the 2.4 and the 5.0 channels. Unplugged it and went back to the original weaker signal from my router, it never dropped with the weaker signal.I plugged the extended back in the next day and tried again, again it dropped the signal. Tried this for a week and gave and and returned it.  It just doesn't seem reliable enough for me or I got a defective one.

    Can be a Repeater OR Access Point
  
",5.0,,"Reviewed in the United States September 13, 2020","









  
  
    
  My deployment for this is as another Access Point in my home office.  I already had 3 TP-Link C9 routers on each floor of our house (basement, 1st, 2nd floors), the 1st/2nd floor C9's configured as just AP's.  Adding this 2nd AP on our second floor allows me to tune down the broadcast/transmit power to med/low range on both AP's yet still have better overall coverage.  By default, the RE230 boots info ""Wifi repeater mode"" but once you log into the web interface, look upper right corner and you can switch it to Access Point mode if desired.  You have pretty good customization options once rebooted into AP mode.  SSID names, WPA security, channels, transmit strength, DHCP or static assign the device an IP, enable/disable DHCP server, etc.  I was essentially able to set this AP up just like my other 3 TPLink devices... not bad considering the price for this is 1/3 the price of another full blown C9 router.

  Really easy to set up from start to finish. I got it for working from home as my office is far away from the router and my VPN kept disconnecting. This solved the issue and kept me with a reliable and full signal. It also helped the picture and signal for one of my security cameras that is near my office. The only downside is that it's basically it's own Wi fi network and you have to connect to it separately from your main router. I was hoping it would just ""extend"" the signal, which it does, but you will have to connect to it with any device you want to use and any time that you move to the area where it's needed. Overall it does exactly what I need it to do and looks nice on the wall.

    Weak and drops signal
  
",3.0,Kenneth F.,"Reviewed in the United States September 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  I bought 2 of these. Easy to install. But both the units have weak connections to the TimeWarner router. Sometimes the connection LED is green and some times red.  The Time Warner signal strength on my cell phone 3-4 bars (4 is maximum) while the extender has a red signal light. I would expect the extender to pick up a signal slightly less than maximum and extend it.  There is less value if it has to be next to the router.  Often I am about 25 feet away from one of the extenders and my phone or laptop show good signal strength, but there is no Internet.  Sometimes it work OK- maybe 40% of the time OK. I also tried another manufacturer that was much more expensive  with a similar result.  My real problem has not been solved;  i just kept the cheaper one!

  Bottom line: pure junk that will work long enough for you to be out of warranty, then die!Not a tech neophyte, or one of those guys that complains the box was too hard to open.  This looked like a good solution to get some extra signal in one dead corner of my house, and it worked great for a few months.  I noticed it wasn't working, and the red ""connected to wifi router"" light was on.  I moved it a little closer, still red.  I put it in the same room, the wifi connect goes green and it works (but of course, pretty useless to extend the range of my network when it has to be in the same room).Full reset, clear to factory defaults, reconfigure.  It just won't connect when more than 10 ft from the router.  My theory is the rf amp is degraded or blown, most probably due to poor thermal design (it gets pretty hot).  The most annoying junk, that works for while, then pops after you can return it

  I have an Optimum Arris cable modem router and was apprehensive that this TP-Link Extender would not be compatible.  Since it was only $30, I took the plunge.  The set-up was a bit more tricky than the instructions lead me to believe.  I downloaded TP-Link's Tether app but that app did not find my Arris modem router.  Rather, I needed to use their website to find my router to complete the installation process.  Once the extender is activated, you need to select the extender network (<router name>_EXT) and provide your current router's password to join.  I plugged in the extender about halfway between the router and our semi-dead spot upstairs.  My son tells me the wifi signal is now better in the study.  It's a good fix for $30.

  The tp-link – Why all lowercase? Are they trying to be cool like k.d. lang? Whatever : ) – Wi-Fi Range Extender (RE220) was a breeze to set up. The directions were clear and simple. I had it working & installed right out of the box in under 10 minutes (OK, maybe 15 : ). The longest time was determining a suitable place to locate it. So, then, yeah, under 15 minutes.Installation tip: When you are first setting up the RE220 and it ‘recommends’ a network name (SSID) for itself – this will typically be whatever is the name of the network (SSID) you have already running in your house but with an “_Ext” on the end. Don’t use that. I mean, you can but if you truly want to seamlessly extend your network, then name it exactly the same as your home network name and use the same password, as well. This way you will always be on the ‘same’ network as you move about the house.

    Very Good WiFi Signal - Didn't Work With My TP-Link Router's MAC Address Filtering
  
",3.0,G. Langlois,"Reviewed in the United States September 28, 2019","









  
  
    
  *UPDATE* - After searching for a range extender that didn't act as a proxy and use virtual MAC addresses, it seems everyone I looked at did this. I guess that's the nature of the beast. I realize MAC addresses can be spoofed; but along with the firewall, anti-virus, and anti-malware it's just adds a bit more protection.I up the star rating from 2 to 3 as the device did what it said it would do. Just doesn't seem good for me.I wanted to get a range extender to help with some weak signal areas in the house. I had great success with my older Wireless-N TP-Link Router so I figured I'd go with a TP-Link RE220 Extender to keep things simple.Before starting the extender setup, I turned off my router's MAC Address Filtering. I still had a bit of a challenge setting up the range extender. Not sure why it didn't work/connect, but I had to do a reset and the setup a second time. This time it connected to my network just fine, so I moved the extender to where I planned to use it. Everything in the area had a great signal and all was well.I went into my router's client list and saw that the MAC address shown for the extender was different from what the extender's label showed. The label MAC address began with ""50-"", but the router showed ""52-""; both addresses ending in ""-99"". I tried both in the MAC filtering, but each time I enabled the MAC filtering the extender would be disconnected.Connected the extender via Ethernet cable directly to my PC and tried the TP-Link Extender web-link. It showed MAC addresses starting with ""50-"", but one ending in ""-98"" for the 2.4 GHz and ""-97"" for the 5 GHz networks. I tried the MAC with the -98 (my network is 2.4 GHz) but no luck.This seemed to be a simple address translation issue, so I updated the extender's firmware to the latest version. Now I saw a totally different MAC address starting with ""22-43-99"". Tried those - no success. I then spoke with TP-Link and their tech said that they used a ""virtual MAC address"" in most of their extenders and they DID NOT recommend using it with MAC address filtering enabled. I asked why, but really didn't get a satisfactory answer. It seems so simple, but I can't get an answer on which MAC address to enter in my router's configuration to allow the extender to pass through.Maybe I'm missing something here, but I use the MAC filtering as another layer of router security. I shouldn't have to disable some security to use an extender, so I'm returning it and will buy something else. However, it won't be a TP-Link product due to this issue. The instructions make no mention of this, but this is information that would be nice to know before purchasing.

The problem is I started randomly losing connection, an issue I did not have before.I disconnected the hardwire but kept the wifi on with the extender, just to rule out it was a bad cable or switch.  Still had the random disconnection.  Unplugged the extender and my speed went down to the previous speed, but  I don't get the drop anymore.I'm going to try a replacement and hopefully it works because the speed difference is huge.

",5.0,Eric F,"Reviewed in the United States August 30, 2019","









  
  
    
  I have a background in IT and was curious how this ""extender"" works. In short, it creates a new network. You place it in range of your existing wifi and it creates a new network that extends out further. You have the option of having it go faster by just using one band (2.4GHz or 5GHz), so that it can dedicate the other band to the back-to-the-other-wifi router (backhauling).In my case I have a deck outside that I like to hang out on but the wifi from the house didn't do a good job of getting all the way out there. I plugged this in on the interior of an exterior wall in a regular outlet that got 3-or-4 / 5 bar signal strength. I created a new network (via the app which is easy to install and pairs with the device) called ""Backyard"" on 2.4GHz and opted for 5GHz to be the backhaul.Even better, I have a home office vpn Meraki that will only work if plugged into a physical ethernet port. Conveniently enough there's one ethernet port on the bottom of this device. Theoretically you could perhaps plug a small switch in there to have a few devices although I'd guess there's a limit to that.All in, these are terrific. Without this I would have constructed some external antenna system that would have costed me multiples of this device. As it stands I don't even think I'll need a second one and it's a tremendous value for what you're getting.

  I have tried many extenders, and this one was by far the worst one I have used. The signal did not get extended very far, and the speed was about 1 mbps whereas if I disconnected from the extender and connected to my base signal (which was very weak) in the exact same spot, I got about 20 mbps. Not great, but miles better than the extender which was supposed to be boosting? not downgrading my speed and strength. If you need to boost your signal to parts of your house, I would recommend just investing in a mesh wifi system.

  Bought one during a deal.  For the price, you can't beat it.  But, it is not as fast as others are the market.  My 230 mbps connection, I could only get 98 mbps from this on the 5 ghz in 40 mhz signal, operating it as an Access Point.  An old Netgear AP i had would get me 180 mbps using the same settings.  The reason I bought another one is the Netgear has stability issues and would stop functioning after a power outage.  These are nice, stable, small, easy, feature rich, able to block clients (this helps when your home has several access points, and you want to share the load and make sure devices near to it will join the specific one you want).  BTW, I'm a network engineer with 15 yrs exp with route and switch, video and voice, security, and wireless.  I suggest these to people to help improve the coverage in their house.I do not recommend using any device as a repeater, because repeaters only repeat the signal at the level it has. Say the place you want to put the repeater measures the signal at -62dBm and it gives you 30 mbps throughput, if you put a repeater in that location, the highest speed you'll get will be 30 mbps even if the signal is strong, -30dBm or more.  You will be repeating the poor signal that it has.  I understand some don't have the luxury of running ethernet throughout the space.  Use a mesh system thats designed to space out things (usually uses a radio to just control the communication between the Access Points).  While not as good as running ethernet to each access point, its better than nothing.

I have an approximately 3500 sq ft split-level house the router is in the back corner of the upper level.  I had a bedroom in the front at the far corner of the same level and a TV ""man Cave"" on the lower level.  Both had problems with wi fi intermittently dropping.  After I placed the extender about midway between the rooms I now have a solid ""Good to Excellent"" signal.The set up effort seems to be worth the effort. One caveat be sure to keep the same SSID for the extender as is on your router.  If you do your internet life will be much nicer.

  Extremely happy with the purchase. My modem is in the far corner of my first floor, and trying to connect to wifi on the second floor of the opposite end of the house was a nightmare. Purchased this bad boy, plugged it in, followed the super easy instructions to set up and BAM, consistent and strong wifi upstairs. I plugged it in to an outlet on the second story that's about at the halfway point between the two ends of the house and have had zero issues. For the price, you honestly can't beat it. My house isn't massive, but it's a decent reach and I'm very happy. Definitely recommend.

  If you have a large house and you are relying on the main router/modem to serve wifi to the entire house and are experiencing some lag time with video, video games or if you utilize internet for tv services like Prime Video, YouTube TV, etc. in the far reaches of your home, especially if you have long winding hallways, these little devices are an inexpensive way to boost your wifi signal throughout your home.I bought two of them and put them in halfway between the router/modem and each end of the home, both of which have winding hallways going to either side, and it worked perfectly. Super easy to set up. Takes 2-3 minutes Max.

  This TP-Link AC750 WiFi Extender is a good buy if you are experiencing problems with getting a good signal on your smartphone or laptop that is in another room away from your router. I live in a CoOp and when it was built many years ago they used plaster & cement, not sheetrock so depending on the device my signal is not always good. This extender works well,, but it is not the easiest setup because you have to try it out a few times to find that ""sweet spot"" in which to put it, somewhere between the router & the problem area. Once that is done, you will wish you had bought it sooner!

  Like many reviews I  found the extender easy to program. It was placed in a recommended area per manufacturer direction. The unit worked as advertised for three days and then started to malfunction giving a ""no internet connection "" indication although the router was functioning. I reprogrammed the unit and it functioned for less than a day. Found that it would reset if removed from the power receptacle and reinstalled but would malfunction hours later. The extender was quite warm when in service. May have been the issue. Returner the unit.

  Now that I'm working from home, I needed a very strong Wi-Fi signal near my home office, which happens to be in the basement. Got the range extender and set it up, which was very very easy. It does a great job of bringing a big strong signal into the home office, but it's slowed down from the speed coming out of the main router. As much as I'd like to have the fastest signal possible, I'd much rather have a strong signal then a super fast one. It's fast enough and it is never gone down in the almost two months since I've had it.

    Wifi Extender works with one minor issue
  
",5.0,Samson Gebre,"Reviewed in the United States February 23, 2020","









  
  
    
  I purchased this a few months after purchasing the TP router and noticed that I had great connectivity everywhere in my home except in my bedroom which is way on the opposite side of my house from the router. The WiFi extender is as easy to install as simply plugging it in and adding the device to your home TP network. The new network that gets created will have the same name as the original network but with an “EXT” at the end and it will automatically switch between both networks to whichever has the strongest signal. Signal speed remains the same with either network. The only minor issue I mentioned is that once a month or so I do notice that connectivity with the extender becomes inconsistent. The original router doesn’t have this problem and it is easily solved by simply unplugging the range extender and waiting a few minutes and then plugging it back again. The ext network automatically restarts itself and nowI have a strong connection again. It doesn’t happen often enough to be a problem and when it does happen it is easily fixed so I still have this product five stars. I would recommend.

  This range extender did not improve wireless internet speed sitting right next to my laptop. Wireless Internet speed was the same if laptop is connected by Wi Fi to main router several rooms away. However, when I connect laptop directly to ethernet port on extender, the results are fantastic.This extender also has a major design flaw physically. While small in size, it covers both electrical outlets on the wall plate. You cannot plug in another device into the wall socket because the ethernet port on extender is positioned underneath instead of on the side of device. The cable will then block your ability to use the second electrical port. Same problem if you plug into a power strip. It covers four electrical sockets. See pictures that accompany this review. Amazing that this obvious flaw was not caught during quality control.

",4.0,,"Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I got the extender because my wireless router even though great inside the house, has horrible range once i step out the front door due to the material my house is made of. Iv tried multiple range extenders to get some WiFi outdoors but they never work, even if they have great connection to the router the extended network is horrible.After i got this extender i had the same issue where i tried repeating my 5g connection that should in theory transmit 65 Mbps but was getting 15 Mbps at most with bad coverage. After a while of bad connection i was going thru the settings in the ""tether app"" TP-Link's ios app and saw the ""high speed mode"" where the extender uses the 5g antenna to receive internet from router and the 2.4 antenna to send the signal. In that mode i got great speed with a steady connection and a great range. I gave a 4 star review because even though the setting is amazing it should be able to repeat both 5-2.4 signals better without that mode.For reference I have a 100 down and 15 up internet service, so this device has plenty of internet available to show me it full potential.In the picture i made a little chart to show the average speeds i got while doing a quick test using an iPhone 6s. The first row is the speed i got standing directly in front of router. The second row is what i got when standing about 3Ft out my door next to a window where the extender is connected below the window, so im literally about 3Ft from the extender. The third row is a test i did in high-speed mode done about 20Ft, i only tested the high-speed mode at that range because 5G lost connection past the 3Ft and the 2.4 had connection but was giving me like 5Mbps results at about 6Ft. I don't know if it was a fluke but the 5G connection did the worst and i tested it a couple of times only using the average result on the chart. The 2.4G did way better that it almost looks reversed with the 5G, but even while writing this review i'm double checking the connection names and re testing getting the same numbers. My advice is using the High-speed mode since it seems to be the best for long range which is what the extender is intended for.A little heads up, these extenders are not meant to give you the full speed your main wireless router does. They are meant to extend WiFi at a decent speed, at $30 and a relocatable small form factor they won’t compete with your stationary more expensive router.

  I’m forever having bad WiFi in my home. I got the idea from a friend to try out and extender which I did and I purchased this one. I have to say it was extremely easy to connect as I can’t stand having to do to much lol and it definitely does work. It’s 4 of us In my household and the amount of devices connected to the WiFi is uncountable. What this does is still used the same WiFi you normally do but it’s somehow apart. In other words instead of everyone using same WiFi connection now we can switch to your same WiFi but thru the extender. So if a WiFi name is - bob - and everyone usually connects to - bob - with the extender it’s another connection named - bob ext - and it doesn’t clog all of the connections to just one direct WiFi. Again you are still connected to your own WiFi but hints it’s an extender. Overall it makes things run smoother in our house as we have changed certain devices to the extender WiFi connection.

  Each year my wife's family gathers at a beach house, my wife and I get the same room, and the wifi is terrible there ... our room is just too far from the router.  These extenders remedied that problem enough that we could stream our favorite shows in the evenings.Set up can be done with a button on the extender, via an app on your phone, or through your computer's web browser.  I did it through my browser and it was really little more than selecting TP-Link from the wireless drop down, creating a password, putting in the router's password, and then moving the extender where you want it.  Done. I'm probably going to get another pair to further extend and strengthen the signal nest summer.

  I have an online job that requires a descent internet speed. Unfortunately in my area we can only get 25 mbps from AT&T. Even worse was using my desktop wirelessly I was getting about 5-8 mbps.. Horrible! Because my office is far from the router I ended up buying a 40' ethernet cable that ran through the house to my router. It was a nuisance having to always step over it but it did put my internet speed at 30 mbps! AT&T and Geek Squad had several expensive ideas for my situation, so I thought I should give this inexpensive Wi-Fi extender a try. I plugged it in behind my desk, rolled up my very long ethernet cable and plugged it in to the extender to see if it still worked. It does! I get the same wonderful speed without having a cable going from room to room. I could try it wireless but why bother. Everything is hidden neatly behind my desk where it cannot be seen. Awesome solution for about $30.

  The TP-Link WiFi Range extender was a total nightmare.  We have Spectrum wifi, and a TP-Link modem & router.  As soon as we activated the TP-Link Range extender, all our wifi disappeared and the name of our Network disappeared from every device.Spectrum could not help, and the engineer from TP-Link could never figure out what went wrong, even with more than an hour of trying to fix the issue with us using various techniques.  We unplugged the new range extender, and the tech was able to get us back our previous networks by resetting us on our TP-Link router.  We will be sending the extender back rather than try it again and lose our wifi Network.  Creepy thing.  The tech had no idea why it affected our wifi that way, but someone else said the device does not work with Spectrum, so we will try a different brand of extender.  Any ideas would be appreciated.

  This works great as an extender, which takes the form of an alternate connection point to your devices (with a name that defaults to xxx_EXT). However, I purchased this because it says it is OneMesh compatible. I have a TP-Link OneMesh router, but the OneMesh configuration screen on the router says that there is no OneMesh device on the network. Likewise, the setup screen on the extender provides an option for selecting a Host network, but does NOT provide an option for selecting a Mesh network to join.  TP-Link provides no email for support questions. Their Chat feature is automated. It will allow you to connect live if none of the canned responses help, so I did that. It said that David would be helping me, but after a couple of minutes it became clear that there was no one on the other end. It had asked me for my email address and a description of the problem, so I hoped that they would get back to me by email, but they did not. So just beware. Despite what it says, it is a standard extender, and will NOT work as a mesh node. Bait and switch.

  Our Verizon WiFI signal had been variable and less than great (Zoom calls freezing up) on my computer, so we bought this after doing some research.  (Main router is at the other computer, two rooms away.) But WiFi is still variable and it is hard to tell whether, on the average, it is better than before.  It's not worse, and I think I am having fewer freezes.  Speed tests give numbers all over the map-- at different times, and even one right after the other. There is no place we can put the extender where there is not at least one wall between it and one of our two desktop computers.

  Well, maybe my signal was not weak enough for me to benefit from this product.  I assumed somewhat lackluster performance on my 200mbps line was due to a somewhat weak signal on the other side of my condo to where my desk is.  I generally see 63-67% signal there.  I get better (but still not what I want to see) speed tests either direct wired or when closer to the router.So I tried this device out, hoping that a stronger signal would equate to more consistent speeds.  Well, in my case it did increase signal strength to the mid-70s, but speed tests showed MUCH WORSE performance when attached to the extended network compared to the main network.  I tried a couple of locations and tried so-called ""high speed"" mode, all to no avail.This might be fine based on my use case.  Perhaps in a case where I had truly horrible signal strength, or an inability to connect at all, this would at least make a connection *possible*, and speed might be the least of my concerns.It was easy enough to install and configure, inconspicuous, and nicely takes up only one (the top) receptacle on a gang.  If it works for you, then you've made a good purchase.  For me, it's a return.

  This extender allows me to stream videos, etc., from my router to my TV , about 25 feet away, around a couple of corners, and past the signal-blocking appliances in my kitchen. I also can mirror content from my phone to the TV while sitting on the couch. So it does what I need. Setup wasn't bad, although I had to get an extension cord to get the extender close enough for the first pairing with the router. After that, I moved it to an electrical outlet closer to the TV. Using the WPS button is easiest for setup -- I had problems figuring out and using the website and phone app (tether). Tech support by email was quick and responsive, although at first I was told to watch a video I already had seen. The tech rep patiently walked me through several questions and was gracious when I realized I had typed in a wrong password.  You'll need the password for your router and will have to set all your devices to use the extender network, rather than the router. But they have the same name and password. I've tried moving the extender to different parts of the house with no luck. But I must admit the locations were not in a straight line with the router. So far, I'm pleased enough.

I did not find it improved my wireless calling on my cell phoneFinally splurged for a mesh system.I was at one point a TP-link fan but poor warranty support is a killer. Not that the cost of this needs a warranty.

I good comparison would be to give a person a new high-end Jaguar car without directions.

  I would suggest updating the firmware ASAP.  I purchased two of these extenders about a month apart.  The first served to get a much stronger signal to my Ring doorbell and kids XBOX.  The second I placed in the garage because I plan on adding another Wi-Fi camera out front.  These extenders don’t extend your existing WiFi SSID they create a 3rd & 4th WiFi network with EXT added to the name of your existing network.  This meant I had to reset the Ring doorbell.  If you understand this then these extenders are a good value.  Once I updated the firmware on both they both became visible in the TP Link app and all is good.  A nice boost to the WiFi where I wanted it.

  Recently changed to a new router and had a couple rooms upstairs that were buffering videos/games. I set up the TP-Link - AC750 WiFi Extender and WOW! what a huge difference. Instructions provided with the extender are easy to follow, choose what set-up option is best for you. I opted for the browser instead downloading the App. At first I couldn't log in using the http/repeater address so I used their http/IP address listed in the guide. If you feel challenged by the set-up, don't be, go to a popular video site and there are some quick videos that will explain. Configuring for the 2.4 and the 5G signals were intuitive, I gave them unique names (NORAD_EXT) so we could easily spot them when logging in with multiple Internet devices (Roku, iPhones, PS3, laptops). NOTE: After set up, plug the extender between the router and the weak or dead zones. In my case, about 25 feet away from router. The green signal readouts will confirm you're good to go.

  We recently had wifi installed at our lake cottage so we can work remotely from there as well as from home.  I bought this extender in the hopes that the signal could be picked up at my parent's cottage next door as well, and also in the ""clubhouse"" in the yard where the kids like to hang out and watch movies.  This extender has worked great!  Between the router on one side of the house and this extender on the other, we can get a clear wifi signal all over the house, our yard, in the clubhouse, and at my parent's cottage.  The signal is adequate for streaming for a good distance in all directions and I can even get a signal down by our boat dock, though it does fade out at the end of the dock, which is 64' long in addition to about 75' of yard in front of the house.  The lake house is on a hill, so that may help increase the range?Works great, very pleased!  Definitely increases our wifi range well beyond the regular router's range, though speed does decrease with distance.  Overall it's awesome!  Really easy to set up as well!

  Since adding to a TP-Link router I figured they would pair right up.  That wasn't the case.  I had to go online and go through the procedure to pair them up.  Once paired up, they work great.  I have a dual band router.  When on the 5 GHz band our wireless TV had poor wireless connectivity, so we had to use the 2.4 GHz.  With the extender, we now have excellent connectivity on the 5 GHz band.  I would have given a 5 star rating if it had been easier to pair.

  Exceeds expectations. I’ve used other inexpensive Wi-Fi extenders but this one is by far the best. My internet provider gives me both 5GHz and 2.4GHz networks in my home. My router is in the basement and this is the first extender that’s been able to acquire the 5GHz signal from the second level and relay it into the deadzone. Other extenders could do it with the 2.4GHz, obviously, but the faster speed is making a huge difference. Super easy to set up.

The second spot was closer to the router, and ended up giving better signal.

  Now that we're running Zoom meetings and classes every day, I needed to boost my signal upstairs in my office. Was hoping this would do it. The extender is directly above the router and is plugged into a wall about 15 feet from my office. The signal definitely looks better on my computer screen, but Zoom still takes up too much band width to be able to run both audio and video. So, I either need to turn off the video or call in on my phone. So, signal is better, but problem is not completely fixed. Overall, I guess not bad for what I spent compared to some of the other options.

    Install your extender on the same floor as your router!
  
",5.0,Joseph Knecht,"Reviewed in the United States November 7, 2020","









  
  
    
  The key to getting the best performance from this wi-fi extender (and probably all others) is to INSTALL IT ON THE SAME FLOOR AS YOUR ROUTER.  I learned this from a poor review of a different product that I was reading after being disappointed with the performance of my PC-Link which I had installed in my library on the floor below at the far end of my house.  The support tech in the aforementioned poor review had said that the product was intended to be installed on the same floor as the router (which in my case was in an upstairs bedroom).  This seemed to a problem for the reviewer, but not for me.  I simply plugged the extender into a power strip in my upstairs office and bingo!  The performance of all the devices in the rooms below improved dramatically, equivalent to the performance in the rooms below the router side of the house.  This makes sense if you visualize the device ranges as circles in a Venn diagram.  Having the devices on the same level maximizes the area of the diagram subset where the data is transmitted.

  I bought this so I can get a better signal for my ring floodlight cam and smart garage door opener in my detached garage as I was losing connection from my main router frequently. I placed the repeater about half way between the garage and the router and unfortunately the signal strength was actually slightly worse in the garage than from my router. However, it does seem more reliable as I haven't had any issues with the signal being completely lost, so even though the signal is low it is stable.The setup is very easy and there's a smartphone app so no need to go to a web portal at some ip address you're going to forget which is great. However I could not find a way to modify advanced settings like change the channel from the app. By default it was using the same 5ghz channel my main router was using and I couldn't find a way to change it, so I ended up just having to disable the 5ghz band entirely in order to prevent interference.Overall don't expect this to drastically change your network performance or range, but in limited use cases such as mine it works fine

  I am not impressed with this.  I bought it because I ended up putting my office in a back bedroom and the WiFi signal has always dropped a bit in the back two bedrooms (3 bars instead of 4)  With the video conferencing needs for work right now I wanted to make sure I didn’t have issues.  What I find is when I look for a WiFi network my regular one will have the 3 bars and the extender will show 4 song select it, as soon as I have it up it too drops to 3 bars.  Every video conference I’ve had with it freezes and jumps at times so it is not a smooth call like It is in the front room.  I have a 1000 sq ft house and the space from the router to the extender is about 10ft (in the same room) and from the extender to the bedroom is only down a 13ft hallway - well within the range it promotes.

  If this didn't perform the simple functions other repeaters do then I could recommend this.  Unfortunately you are very limited with what you can do.To extend the existing wireless network you have to use the existing wireless network password.  You can change the network name to anything you want, but are forced to use the same Wi-Fi password.  I purchased this because my mother had her Internet Service Provider change her modem and they didn't configure it with her existing network settings.  Now all her smart devices stopped working.  Tried to install this repeater and change the extended Wireless network to match the old settings, but since we can't change the wireless password, it makes this unit useless!  Such an easy fix, but a sign of very lazy programming!  Contacting Support made the experience even worse.  Their support tech was very condescending!  Much better companies out there!

  Total waste of money. These did absolutely nothing to help extend my wifi.  In fact, my coverage got worse with these installed. They are slower to transfer data, set-up as new network names which have to be attached to as you move between them, and slow down traffic downline. Get off this old patchwork system and go with mesh instead.Mesh wifi systems are so cheap right now and easy to install (eero, Google Nest, Orbi, TP-link). No reason not to go there. Also, with smart devices becoming cheap and ubiquitous, downloading and running Google Home to run lights, media, group smart speakers, activate dimmers, monitor cameras and security, run routines, and much more is the way to go. With mesh, you will never drop calls as your phone shifts between nodes or lose connectivity with your devices. You can also keep track of every device using your network, what download speeds you are getting, set up guest networks, prioritize devices, etc, just by using their app on your cell.

I have to  deleted the RE220 info from my wifi and delete my Network info on my laptop and reinstall the my Network info from my wifi.I do not recommend this company for any equipment and support issue.

  I agree with some previous reviews who said that the privacy policy that must be accepted in order to use this is absurd. As usual, it's difficult to understand the legal stuff, but they seem to be saying they can use any information they get and give it to 3rd parties. This was a deal breaker for me. I am returning it.I can't speak to how well it works because I was unable to set it up due to the fact that I would not accept the privacy policy.

  Initially I tried to set up the extender using the WPS button and it would not allow me to log on.  I reset the unit using the button on the bottom and then set it up using my web browser.  No problem.  The Tether application seems to imply the you need a different password to be created to log in to the extender but you do not.  I used the original password for the router and it worked fine.  You do need to set up a different password to initially do the set up and any administrative functions but this is not for logging in to the extender wireless.

  Before buying this extender I had my firestick directly connected to the router. Sometimes, every once in a blue moon my stream would pause but other than that no further issues. I was simply hoping to completely get rid of this little hiccup with this extender.Cue in the  AC750 extender. -I received my ""extender"" promptly from Amazon as usual. My main router is located in the first floor of my home.I placed the extender on the second floor, about 20 feet from the router's position.Setup was simple, I proceeded to connect my Amazon fire stick to the extender. Upon trying the new connection my fire stick kept freezing and losing connection.  At some point, I had the message ""connected to network but no internet"".I had to unplug the extender to regain wifi connection on my fire stick.  This happened about 7 times in a single night.  Long story short, my wifi connection is faster and more reliable directly from the router than from the AC750.Did all sorts of testings too.  Tried positioning the extender at a mid point between devices.  Closer and farther from the router, and/or devices.  Same result.I can not recommend this device.

  Bought this for use with my Spectrum router which was just updated/replaced within this past year. Unfortunately I had the same issue as other Spectrum users did where the extended goes through the whole setup without issue and even allows you to “connect” to the router WiFi only to find out it won’t actually connect in full. It shows the networks as available and let’s you connect and input the WiFi’s password but after completing it shows the network as unavailable. I did all 3 setup processes shown on the instructions but nothing works. So if you have A newer spectrum router then there is a good chance that it won’t work for you.

It is possible that TP-Link will add compatibility through future updates, but it looks like not much progress has been made along these lines since OneMesh was released, so I have to switch WIFI networks on my devices as I move through the house, which is less than optimal.

    Works well for remote IoT devices, but beware of the virtual MAC addresses it assigns
  
",5.0,Simon Chadwick,"Reviewed in the United States October 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  I got this extender to reach two Shelly1 WiFi-based relays to control a remote gate. It works well for this purpose, and I mounted the extender about 30 feet from the WiFi router, outside the house in a plastic waterproof box, underneath the eve of the roof.IoT devices are typically assigned static IP addresses, and this is what caused me problems initially. See the attached screenshot of my WiFi router's static IP address page. When a device is connected to the TP-Link range extender, its apparent MAC address becomes a virtual one, comprised of the first 3 octets of the repeater's MAC address plus the last 3 octets of the device's MAC address. So for static IP address assignments, both the device's physical and virtual MAC addresses must be assigned. I hope this will save someone the time spend figuring this out ;-)

   I have a bedroom at the end of the hallway which needed WiFi to reach it. It’s not that long and I thought that an extender would do the job. My router barely reaches the end of the hallway and I just needed a little extra push for better reception. The problem is this extender just didn’t provide sufficient boost to solve my simple problem even after putting it at different points between the service area and the dead zone.The Pros:1)Nicely designed with a clean aesthetic2) Very easy to set up3) Doesn’t need a lot of electricity and it’s two prong4)For older devices you can plug in an Ethernet cable directly into the extenderThe Cons:1) Doesn’t provide sufficient boost for some routers (I’m not saying it isn’t helpful for less powerful router it may be but for me it wasn’t.2) Mainly useful in line of sight and not around corners or behind walls3) Only boosts basic internet speeds.Summation:If you need reception/service around numerous walls and corners then it would be better to get a mesh next work. If you can can optically see the dead zone then this might be what you’re looking for.

Tech Support (so called) said it's not supposed to make it faster, just extend further.  But no matter where I placed it, it did not extend the range of the wifi in any way I could detect.  All of the info from the extender's app makes it look normal, but AFAI can tell, it just provides a second wifi network name that is half the speed of the router's network, and extends no further than the original router signal.  After extensive discussion with both Amazon and the company's tech support, I still can't tell whether my particular device is defective or whether I'm dealing with a poor product, notwithstanding all the positive reviews.

  I've had this guy for a couple months now and it's awesome. Didn't know too much about extenders when I bought it but it turned out to be exactly what I needed.If you're down to the reviews and still not sure what this one does it's basically this: you plug this thing in the wall near enough your existing ""router bubble range"" so it can still pick it up, sync it up per the instructions, it creates a duplicate ""clone"" network and effectively *extends* your wifi's range.So I've got 3 floors but my router only covers the middle and lower. I put this thing in the hall by the stairs and it strengthened my wifi for the whole top floor.TVs (netflix etc), ps4, phones, tablets, Zoom on laptops, they all can run off the cloned network and it works just as good as the wifi downstairs.Bonus, when we have power outages it doesn't freak out, it just turns itself back on with the power and syncs back up no sweat.You can also name the cloned network whatever you want and set the password. I just did the same thing as the wifi downstairs but it'd be cool to set it differently if you were doing an Airbnb or renting out something.

  TLDR: The internet from this device (not the WiFi signal itself) is very unstable. The device uses a lot of power. Customer support is bad.With my whole family working and schooling from home and all of us mostly spread out upstairs (our router is downstairs) I figured this would be great to boost our upstairs signal to the back bedrooms. Installation was relatively easy and took about 10 minutes. You need to use TP-Link's app which is a little clunky, but you can get through it.I immediately noticed that the device got very warm, very quickly. It never got hot, but this thing clearly burns a lot of power and I'm not sure why. That was my first indication that this was maybe not a great pick.Over the course of the next two weeks, my wife and I both experienced frequent internet, not WiFi, disconnects when connected to this extender. Working from home, this meant video calls were dropping left and right. Thinking it was our internet, we switched back to the router WiFi instead of the extender and the problem vanished. Back to the extender, and there it was again.Attempted to work with TP-Link tech support, which was sooooo bad. After waiting 40 minutes for anyone to even connect to the chat and then another 10 minutes for the rep to say anything after she did, her advice was to force a specific channel for my home WiFi on 2.4 and 5GHz. What?! So the problem is that your hardware can't effectively a WiFi standard?Stay away and buy something else. This is already in a box getting sent back to Amazon.

  The one drawback to all these types of devices is that you're limited to the outlet locations of your house.  With an older house like mine, you can't try a new outlet every 6 ft.With that limitation, I'm either so close to the original that it's not giving me much more range or I'm so far away from the main router that it isn't picking up enough signal to boost in the first place.  Streaming videos were stalling just frequently enough to be annoying.  Better than nothing.  But maybe not.Installation took more steps than it should.  I had to sign up for an account rather than simply picking up a signal from the device.  I don't know if  that is normal for these things.  But I didn't like it.Recently we had a service technician come to the house and the gadget ""happened to disappear"" upon his departure.  I'll have to get another one.

  Why. Not the best or easiest to use.  Setup wasn't too bad but it will show up as full strength connection on my device but then I see that I am connected but no internet.  I have to unplug it and plug it in again so it reset every couple days.  I also don't like that it doesn't provide mesh network for the router that I have so I have to make sure to manually switch the network I want to connect to from my device when moving from one area of the house to the other.  If you looking for a quick inexpensive solution that isn't perfect and has some quirks, this will suffice but for a long term, more seamless suction for signal strength and area coverage, I'd go with a mesh service device and make sure it is compatible with your router.  Might be a bit more money but would be worth it in the long run.

  WiFi Signal - Goes in and out and will disconmect and connect to other networks randomly. If you look at it wrong, the connection m is lost or very weakTech Support - They have chat support which is nice, but any actual troubleshooting is done by scheduling a call with someone overseas to remote into your computer and poke around. Not only are you giving full access to your computer, but you have to do so in the middle of the night (assuming you're in the US), because they only work on their hours overseas.Easy to Install - 30 minutes of plugging in near router/modem, unplugging, plugging into another outlet closer to where you need the signal, seeing if it is strong enough, and repeating.Spend a little but more money on a better, higher end wifi extender, if you don't know, you will be down the line.

  I live in a 70 year old home that has lath and plaster walls throughout most of the house.  This makes it difficult for wifi access.  I thought the booster would help and it does, but minimally.  I don't think it's the fault of the product, but rather that of manufacturers who believe that all interiors are drywall only and won't be bothered with other structures.  Until the U.S. catches up to the technologies offered in other parts of the globe, we'll have to limp along on slow, outdated wifi signals.

  An absolute breeze to set up.  I just pressed the WPS button on my router and then held the WPS button on the extended for 1 second.  A minute or 2 later it was set up on both 2.4 and 5G bands.  And it works exactly as it should.  I have it at the top of our stairs in our 2-story house, and now the two upstairs dead/slow zones are no more.  I bought and returned 2 other extenders before settling on this one, but my search has now come to an end.***One additional note on performance:  I'm now getting 40+ mbps on 2.4G and 60+ mbps on 5G with the extender in my previously slow zones.  Those areas with my router alone get 8-12 mbps and 0-4 mbps respectively.  So yes, it works great.

    RE230 compared to RE200, RE210, RE220, RE450 & $300 Mesh WiFi systems
  
",3.0,Consumer Advocate,"Reviewed in the United States July 25, 2019","









  
  
    
  Having been a techie & beta tester for decades, I'm always happy to find a device that is actually BETTER than it's older model(s). However, the Re230 is a disappointment when compared to prior models. There are 3 ways to link the device as an extender. I always use the easiest which is the WPS buttons on my router and the extender. In order to get the RE230 to connect to 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz you have to do this procedure twice.PLACEMENT is the #1 key to getting the most out of these extenders. Took some trial and error in a 2 story 2000sf home where I am powering 56 devices off a TP-Link CR1900 modem/router. Before pandemic, Cox delivers a consistent 180Mbps at upstairs centrally located router. With an RE220 downstairs, through 3 walls, floor and over 30 feet away from router, my Android TV Box was grabbing 141Mbps from the RE220 (see photo with speedtest results) which surpassed ALL the similar small plug-ins and even the $300+ highly-advertised mesh systems. The RE230 delivered only 106Mbps and the WiFi was not as good as the RE220, meaning it left some of my WiFi devices offline.The ONLY extender I've yet to try is the Netgear EAX80 but I will be watching reviews of it to see if it could possibly be worth more than 10 TIMES the price of TP-Link RE220, which will remain my #1 choice for now.Don't want to mislead anyone so I will mention that in order to serve all 64 of my WiFi devices I have a total of 3 little TP-Link extenders. Two are RE220 and 3rd one is a RE200. All 3 are basically at the furthest indoor outlets in my home and for the record, my WiFi devices include 3 Amazon Echo Dots, 2 Echo Input, Rachio, Kwikset, Zmodo cams, Wyze cams, Smartthings hub, plus a few dozen smart plugs and smart bulbs all connected to Alexa.

  I did some quick research for a range extender. We had a lower end tp-link router and were happy with it. I decided to go with the tp-link range extender.The issue is getting the Wi-Fi further out to the RV pad. We bought a better dual band tp-link router that really helped. So into the range extender to get full strength.Installation was a breeze with the WPS setup. I quickly connected both bands on the network. I placed the range extender in the bathroom that only had an exterior wall to reach the RV.The result was one bar to not seeing the extender in the RV. I have a better signal from the dual band router. It's pretty disappointing to say the least. I have a good working knowledge of networks. We used a Netgear extender at our previous house that works great. I have very little interference from the router to the extender and the extender to outside.The screenshot is from my iPhone standing in front of the house where both the router and extender are located. I'm actually standing closer to the extender. Disappointed and returning it.

  We live in a concrete and metal stud 2150 ft2 condo.  Router on one end of the unit, TV with ROKU on the other.  I don't want to look at my electronics, so have the router behind a cabinet and the ROKU behind another.  THere are 4 metal stud/drywall walls between the two - probably 60-70 feet apart.  Well, the ROKU got a WEAK signal.  I considered moving the router or the ROKU, but didn't want to look at wires or devices, so bought this.  Very inexpensive.  First attempt to intall failed because I entered wrong wifi password.  The extender ""accepted"" it, but was not repeating the signal.  Luckily, I went in to rename the network -EXT to see if ROKU would find that network better and noticed that I entered the wifi password wrong.  Corrected that and all is well.  You need the app, no problem.  It would be 5 stars if the device let me know it was not connected to my router.  But, I am glad I have this and I now have excellent ROKU signal and speed in the othe room.

  The only con I can offer is that perhaps once a week the wifi signal drops a bit.  I'm not sure if it's a problem with the extender or position of the router, but since the router is in line of sight, straight up the stairs and just inside the home office door, my guess is the extender just drops the connection.  Most days, the signal range has been extended 25-30' through an exterior wall and onto the back deck.  On a few days, the wifi will easily go another 30-40' into the back yard.

  It took me a few hours to attempt to use this both as an extender as an access point - neither of which worked well. As an extender (it's core purpose), it gave super crappy signal and it took me 12 different tries just to get it to connect to my host network. Super pathetic and then it gave... maybe 1/100th the speed it was supposed to?As an access point - using my wired network as the host, which should also mean TOP speeds - it gave about 1/10th my normal speeds. If you live with not-so-fast broadband already (let's say, 15 mbps down) and you have severe deadzones in your place, I guess this could be passable. For anyone with relatively high speeds (100 mbps down or faster) and mild deadzones just look into a mesh network. Not this thing.

  Didn't expect much for the price but it works exceptionally well.  Purchased exclusively to extend 5GHz network for streaming HD video to a Roku with poor signal.  I found that ""high speed mode"" works best, where the extender connects to the router via 2.4GHz and then extends the 5GHz network ONLY.  This gives it the strongest signal to the router and works well even though our 2.4 here in our neighborhood is saturated.  No buffering and no lag, went from 1mbps to 35mbps at the roku speed testing the connection on 5GHz.Installation was a breeze with the app you download from your app store.  Really couldn't ask for a more efficient, easier to implement solution to poor wifi signals.

Tried accessing a web site and it took forever to load. Used the ookla speed test and the result showed a speed below 2 mbps. I ended setting up the repeater about 25 feet away from the main router, but that was not much help. I even tried the speed test a few feet away from the extender and the results were only marginally better. I ended up returning the extender and replaced it with power line ethernet modules and an old router I had on hand; a much more reliable solution.

  The Problem: I have a Galaxy Note9. I use the Smart Lock feature that keeps my phone unlocked when I’m at a ‘trusted place’ such as my home. Before I purchased the TP-Link AC750 my phone would not recognize where I was and automatically lock at home. This happened when I was in my office or back bedroom far away from my router. Worth mentioning, I keep mobile data turned off so I’m always on Wi-Fi at home. My office is about 70’ from the router and at my desk I’d only get a Wi-Fi signal of 1 bar, sometimes no bars. If I held my phone up above my computer monitors I might get 3 bars.Since I installed the TP-Link AC750 at about the midway point between the router and office I get 5 bars everywhere in my house and my phone hasn’t locked once.Remember to change your phones connection to the TP-Link instead of your router.If you found this review helpful, please click the ‘helpful’ button.

  We have a 1,600 sq ft house, two levels (all wood and drywall, no solid walls). Our main signal is upstairs in one end of the house and we wanted to extend the signal.

  Located the device one floor below the router.  The dead zone was the furthest point from the router.  Went from 2 bars to 4 bars, MUCH faster on the laptop now.  Good bye dead zone.  One caveat I would like to share.  It took several tries to pair with WPS on the router, but that was not the fault of the extender.  After two false starts, I went to the router manual (supplied by my cable company) and realized that WPS had to be enabled (via a web GUI) on the router before by pressing the WPS button on the router.  Once I enabled WPS on the router, the extender paired almost instantly.  Connection between the laptop and extender was equally quick.  I realize that routers are different but verify that the WPS button on your router is lit before pairing.  Other than this hiccup, process was very quick and the extender works great, and for a reasonable price.

  First off, I have good knowledge of Wi-Fi networks and networking in general.  I could not get this unit to maintain a connection with my network even after reaching out to their technical support.  I must have reset the unit at least a dozen times and tried many different configurations such as:  - Repeating both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz / only 2.4 GHz / only 5GHz  - Broadcasting a new SSID / same SSID  - Selecting different security protocols  - Playing around with various I.P. address settingsImmediately after a reset/configuration/reboot, I would be able to connect to the new network and have full internet access.  However, a short while later, I would lose internet connectivity.  I would still be able to login to the repeater's admin page with a web browser, but I would have no access to the internet.  The lights on the unit would indicate that it had a strong Wi-Fi signal and that it was working as expected.  From that point on, the only way I could get the unit working again was to do another reset/configuration/reboot.  I explained the problem to one of the technical support people on the TP-Link website, but he/she was of little help.  The support person just told me to try broadcasting the same SSID of the network I was trying to connect to.  I had already tried that about 5 times without success.  I'm not sure if my problems are unique to my specific router/AP, but none of my other devices have ever had issues connecting to it.  I ended up just buying an additional Wi-Fi access point and setting it up in a different location in my house.

I tried moving it to some different locations, all of which alowed the extender to lock to the router, but which had other ""issues"" (NOT related to the extender). So until I can figure out a better location, it is back above the counter. The note is this: While the extender locked in to the router again (you do have to be a bit patient), Firestick was intially not happy this time - very good signal but no internet. However this cleared up with just a bit a fiddling between ""home"" and the wi-fi setup. screen.  Be patient.Update: It turned out that I could cure the unhappiness of my Firestick by using a longer HDMI extender cable instead of the Wi-Fi extender. If you have a similar issue, it may be cheaper to solve the problem that way. But the extender is still useful or other things. A longer cable only helps one device.

    Unreliable connectivity -> Useless. Not recommended.

  I’m pretty bummed on a few fronts here.  I’m used to Apple Airport and other Mesh solutions and how they extend a network, resulting in one network with broader reach. This creates a new network (one 2.4 GHz and one 5.0 GHz, so actually 2 networks) that repeat the original network, but require you to join a different WiFi network. That means devices that could share things across WiFi (like iPhones controlling Apple TVs) won’t work unless you switch them both. I guess that’s the price you pay for such a low-cost solution. Not a deal breaker, but annoying.My bigger issue is that it’s unreliable. It has been tough to get devices to connect to it sometimes, and doesn’t always get an internet connection for long time after booting up (like over 5 minutes, though sometimes it takes a reboot). That’s really frustrating. I have this in my garage for a workout equipment area network, and turn it on when I go out there to workout, so I end up losing 5-10 minutes just dealing with the network issues.Lastly, there are 5 LEDs on the front, but 6 labels. One of the lights is red, but I don’t know if it’s for WiFi or 5GHz since it’s between the two. When I use the app, it looks like 5GHz is working, and I know WiFi is working since I can connect to it, so maybe it’s just a manufacturing mistake where they meant to use a green light but put in a red one?UPDATE: The reliability has just gotten worse. Despite having a good connection to the main network, it drops the connection or the throughput is unusable. I can connect devices around it to the main network and they work really well, so the issue is definitely the extender.This purchase has essentially been a waste of time and money. I would not buy this again or recommend it.

  UPDATED REVIEW 3/14/21Originally I gave this device 5 stars, but since that review, I have lowered to 2  stars. Since January (3 months since install,) periodically, the TP-Link loses internet connectivity and any devices connected to it also lose internet. At first I hadn't realized this was happening and our Lennox thermostat quit working and we were looking at having to replace that ($800) before I noticed it had no internet. Once I connected the thermostat directly to the regular router, those issues went away.I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because if I reset the TP-Link it does reconnect to the internet and work for a while before it drops internet connection. At this point I wouldn't recommend this and have essentially stopped using it.ORIGINAL REVIEWComputers in the office have always had low signal strength, due to passing through several walls (I guess?) Anyway, bought this for $29.99, good price.  install wasn't too difficult. Used the app on my phone. It took a coupe of tries and about 15 minutes and had the Extender in our WiFi network. Moved the unit to the hall right outside office door with line of sight and bingo, connection now shows all 5 bars and great signal strength - used to only get about 3 bars and fair. So far I am happy, no more dropped signal. Yes, I would recommend

  We have a new two story home. For whatever reason, the  electrician wired the AV to enter at the second story. When the cable company did their bit, they of course installed the cable box and internet router upstairs. Being a concrete block home (Florida), WiFi downstairs, in some reasons is a bit spotty depending on the device being used. So, I researched WiFi extenders and purchased this unit. Bottom line, the original router provides a stronger signal, even downstairs, than this extender.Installing the unit is a breeze. I recommend using the smartphone method. Worked like a champ. I used the location feature to determine the best location downstairs, and that worked beautifully. The device indicates a perfect strong signal.So then I reconfigured the WiFi settings to see the extender's Wifi network and the signal strength on each device downstairs, even 10 feet from the extender, shows less signal strength than the original router. How can that be? I tried both 2 ghz and 5 ghz networks, and there is absolutely no improvement, and in fact, degradation. Devices (Kindles, Fire TV) that were having trouble before, continue to have the same issues.I will give it more time and play with settings, but since the install and configuration went so smoothly and everything ""works"", I am not confident there will be improvement.So I guess the Spectrum router (Florida) is one heck of a router....

  I had used and still do a tp-link light bulb. No issues in more then 3 years.Seem the tp-link WiFi extender and figured since the light has Ben working great, I'll try it.You see I had already purchased another extender, but the directions were confusing. So I ordered the tp-link WiFi extender. The best part is you get it setup via the app and it's saved. Just determine your application and a couple selections later your all set.The app is awesome, it has a guide for placement that helped so much. I intend to use it for my security can, and I know it will work. I just need help to do it, being disabled is sure not what I intended to be. Anyway, this was one product that I will continue to endorse, so easy, and setup is a breeze.

  Ditto to the other 5 star reviews. Couldn't get continuous good signal on the front porch to watch streaming sports. Started looking for a signal extender, expecting to have to pay much more. Set up using the Tether app which walks you through the process clearly and easily. Took only a couple minutes to create another  network just inside the porch, with 2.4GHz and 5GHz signals having the same identifier as the routers' except with _EXT added. Tested the strength of both signals, with my phone. Full bars just like from the router's signals when in the room with the router. The real test will come tomorrow evening as I attempt to watch a streaming baseball game on my tablet on the porch, after which I'll add an update.  UPDATE: Streaming on the porch is great. The signals for the extender links show 3 of 3 bars, while the signals from the router show 2 of 3 bars, indicating why streaming on the porch directly from the router was erratic. Go ahead, buy this device.

  Let's keep it simple:  These devices are quite complex on what they do.  Still set-up is as easy as plug it into a socket and find the signal in your device.  if you follow the instructions it works perfectly.  Note, normally wall sockets are low on the wall, so mine I used an extension cord and set it up in the wall.  What a difference!  It picks faint signals from another access point far away, broadcasting pretty good on 3 extra rooms.  Very happy, will buy again.  On tech support, you'll speak with people with heavy accent but understandable, and they have all the patience in the World to get to the bottom of the issue (Experience on another different TPlink device).

  I was surprised at how easy it was to set up the device and what a good signal I received from a remote section of the space I'm in.So often, one comes to find that the ""quick start"" of a product is much more involved than described.  With this product, a free downloadable smartphone app walks you through the entire set up.After the set-up, however, I started having doubts because my laptop showed the same weak signal strength that I had before -- only two bars.  Despite the two bars, I indeed had a strong and fast connection.  it is just as fast and strong as when I am at my other computer, which is only a few feet away from my router.

  On the plus side the TP-Link AC750 had no issues connecting to my original router, it seemed happy almost no matter where I placed it. On the other hand, devices struggled to connect to the extender unless they were in the same room. Passing through 1-2 walls dropped the signal strength to almost the same level as the original wifi network.Adding an extension cord to the device and perching up high on a dresser mirror increased the range enough to get a decent connection in an adjacent room. I wish I could have just left the device in the outlet.

  Even though the signal is fine, what is missing is the internet speed.  It still has to communicate to the wifi router and that is the weak link here.  And the signal seems to go up and down on its own with nothing being moved.  If the speed were closer to the wifi router speed, that would be something that would make it actually useful.  I find it better to just bypass this extender and connect to the weak signal of the wifi router.

  We were having issues with our Apple TV located downstairs (basically on the opposite side of the house from our router). The signal was very spotty, especially if someone was on their phone or downloading something at the same time. We plugged this in just at the bottom of the stairs, where it indicated it was getting a good signal. The WPS method is easy to get setup with since it’s just a button click. I did end up going into the interface and changing the SSID to match my existing router so that I didn’t have two distinct networks in the house that I had to manually flip between. But that was super easy as well - they have a button that simply says “match host said” that you can click. All in all it’s doing a great job - Signal is great for streaming downstairs. Easy to set up, haven’t had any issues so can’t speak for the support aspect of it.

  Easy install but doesn't matter if u still get weak signal. I'm desperate for some good wifi coverage in the detached garage across the house. The house got strong expensive wifi coverage. But once install this the wifi gets reduced significantly as well. I put the device in the best location. I get only one bar if opened garage door fully. If close it I don't get any. The garage is just 10-15 feet away from the device across the door/hallway. The router is set up nicely in the middle of the house too. I talked to friendly tech supports but gave me different information over the phone versus the email info they sent me. And that didn't work as well to amplify the signal. Not only that now my wifi is dead. When it did work for a little bit everything is slow and laggy. I really don't know what to do here and need help. I need wifi asap to study and work. The only way maybe to daisy chain it but someone in review said maybe not to do it. However when I asked manufacturer tech support they just said maybe helps but saying there's interferences. Of course there's basic interferences for everybody; that's why we need better wifi extenders.

It’s super easy to install, you can setup everything with a mobile app or web browser. WiFi signal is strong and stable!Before having this extender, our study on the other end of the house was only getting 10% of our subscribed bandwidth, but after adding the extender, it significantly increased to over 70-80% of what we are entitled for.

I admit that I'm asking a lot by bouncing the signal around from PLEX >iOS airfoil satellite>desktop airfoil satellite>desktop airfoil>airport express, but it seemed to work better before.  (Edit upon further testing)-connecting to the stronger _EXT network outside and switching to the stronger host network inside was annoying.  There is a way to clone the host network name and password to the _ext network so you ""see"" only one network, but that caused all sorts of havoc of dropped wifi, internet dropouts, inability to access router/modem web admin pages.

The location of the Ethernet port obstructs the adjacent wall plug (see photos), so I had to use a travel adapter which detracts from the nice design.  3) in my setup I’d like to disable the WiFi repeater,  I’m only using this as an Ethernet port,  but the settings don’t seem to provide a way to disable WiFi repeater.  So three things to improve: add gigabit Ethernet; move the Ethernet port;  software update to offer disable WiFi repeater.

  The main concern I had was people's reviews about the smartphone app setup option (the one with the severe privacy user agreement). I bought the product anyway after searching around for non smartphone setup options. The setup involves connecting via WiFi directly to the extender. The range extender wasn't broadcasting when I first powered it up. My next instinct was to do a hard reset (holding the red button for 10 seconds with a paper clip). After the hard reset, I found the WiFi signal and proceeded to access the extender settings through a web browser, as you would when setting up a router.The second concern I had were people's reviews about this product dropping connections often, particularly when the device had aged a few months. I haven't experienced any such problems yet. One of the things I do to prevent my devices from confusing the extender and the main router (which is far, but can sometimes appear in range) is to give the extender a WiFi broadcast name that is completely different from the one my router is broadcasting. That way, the devices paired with the extender don't attempt to pair with the main router directly. My guess (big guess, I'm no expert) is that people's connection dropping may be due to their laptops or smartphones trying to flip back and forth between connecting to the extender and the main router.

It’s a bit more expensive but I would say well worth the investment. I returned the two extender units, and got TP-Link Deco Whole Home Mesh WiFi System instead.

  For 99% of the people, this is super easy to install -- give it your wifi info, and it extends your signal with new SSIDs. Since our 'weak spots' still technically have a signal, we kept separate SSIDs because the devices won't 'automatically drop' the weak one. For the 2nd device, I'm using it as an access point from a LAN cable run from my main router. So the set up was different, I fumbled around with it a bit and finally got it to work. Once I got it configured right, it works great just like my other one.

Can't recall my exact issue, but needed to reset the extender twice and do a manual setup through the IP config page if memory serves. But, now that it's up and running no worries at all. We've even unplugged for extended periods doing electrical work on the house and fires right back up every time. Nice when something works!

    Easy solution to my problem
  
",5.0,IRL714,"Reviewed in the United States May 28, 2020","









  
  
    
  I have a detached garage with a wifi-enabled garage door opener, which supports Amazon Key delivery. The problem was that the garage is so far detached from my home and wifi router that it would lose the connection multiple (5-7) times every day. I'd get alerts through the myQ and Key apps that ""your garage is offline"" at all times of the day & night. Not only would it be possible to miss my precious deliveries from Amazon, but I also couldn't open my garage with my phone while it was offline. So I bought this wifi extender hoping it would extend the wifi to the garage. Long story short... it did!! All it took was a 10-minute set up via the Tether app (I have a Google router), placing the extender in an outlet closer to the garage, and my opener has not lost wifi connection even once in 3 days!! I'm very happy. Worth every penny!

  *BUYER BEWARE - PRIVACY POLICY VERY INVASIVE*!!!!!I was all ready to install this extender and had downloaded the tethering app and then their privacy policy loaded, when I read it I freaked out! They basically said they could use any info that went thru their extender for themselves, their affiliates, their subsidiaries, China. The list of personal info they were giving themselves rights to were everything from name, address, phone numbers, browsing history, purchasing history, including account numbers. It was all fair game and you have to click, I agree. Well, I don't agree! I checked on Linksys/Belkin extender policies.

  The product is sleek and goes unnoticed. The easy set up via the tether app was great. Unfortunately, from a range and speed perspective, it really leaves a lot to be desired. I have a 1000mbps connection with a standard ATT router. We wanted this to help some dead areas in a 2000sq ft home. It accomplished that but the speeds once connected are horrible! Even via the “boost” option - it barely reaches between 5-20mbps when connected to the 5ghz WiFi connection. I don’t get it. There aren’t that many options to manage the extender via the app and via the web you get a few more options that do not really help diagnose the speed issue.

  It installed alright.  I got this because one bedroom of my house has a poor spot for speed.  After installing this, I tried it in 9 different locations upstairs and downstairs.  I got worse speeds than even with just the router. Half the speeds even.  With the rotuer alone, that bedroom gets around 75Mbps.  Sometimes less.  After connecting this device, the best I got was 50Mbps.  Even that was not consistent.  It would drop to 25 often.  Now, this is the second one I have tried over the years.

  I had a dead spot pretty far away from my router, down some stairs and way in the back of another room.  The flat panel TV would constantly buffer, you couldn’t use it. I put this in the same outlet of that TV and now the TV works perfectly. Clear screen and no buffering.  I didn’t put it half way between the router and TV like they tell you to do, I literally put it as far away as the TV is.  My theory is that the wifi antenna in the TV may not be nearly as good as the one on this extender. I also plugged my TV directly into this extender using a 3’ Ethernet cable; a direct connection is always best, which is something many of these extenders don’t offer.  My outlet is already on the wall behind the TV, so no wires show.  Last, the lights on the extender are not bright so they don’t distract you.  Really happy with this extender.

  I tried it in multiple positions and even with a clear shot to my wifi when I connected to this extender the speeds simply were not acceptable at roughly 10% of what my router could put out. I ended up buying another wifi router and running Ethernet to use it as an access point. Also this thing was a pain to setup with me wasting a lot of time with the app and browser, which ultimately didn't work. I ended up having to use the old press the button on the wifi router and extender method, which was simple enough but damn I wasted like an hour or two on the other methods for it ultimately to be super slow and useless anyways. Wifi extenders feel like a scam, just spend that hour or two running an Ethernet cable if you can and using a second router as an access point. MUCH better solution.

  I have MAC restrictions on my Wi-Fi router enabled, so when a new Wi-Fi device needs to connect to it I simply look/find the MAC address of the new device and I add it to the whitelist to allow that device. BUT to simplify the MAC entering I simply - disable the restriction - (so that the device connects with no problem) and the router simply lists the MAC addresses of the devices that have connected (then I just copy and paste the address to the whitelist) AND later re-enable the restriction.After adding the MAC of the RE230 (labeled as such when connected) as seen (and the same) in the box/device/AND router connection listing. It still would not give me internet, so I decided to check if theres another MAC and I my router tells me its a DA:07... (no vendor ID), but I checked and re-checked by connecting/disconnecting and they show up together AND whenever the RE230 re-connects.I said OK, I'll just add that ""no label"" MAC to the whitelist restiction and re-enabled the restriction. But still no internet!Conclusion: There is not only one MAC (RE230), there's another which starts with DA:07... (no vendor ID) and there's AT LEAST one other that is connecting to my router.Question:Why does tech support deny this?What nefarious reasons can THEY use these hidden MAC addresses for?How can I determine all MAC's TP-Link is using (possible from Windows)?

  Our work Wi-Fi can be spotty sometimes and we run EVERYTHING on Wi-Fi now. From out point of sale to our music system... it's all wireless so if our Wi-Fi goes wonky, everything starts to act weird. Before switching providers I thought I would give an extender a shot first. I didn't want to go all in on an expensive item, so when I saw this model for less than $25 I went ahead and ordered it. It came today and so far, so good.I was a little worried about the installation after reading the reviews here. But when I got it and opened the instructions I saw there were three methods that could be used. I went with putting the app on my phone and going from there. This unit was up and running in less than ten minutes. Most of that time was just me re-checking to make sure I didn't miss a step.First I installed the app. Next I plugged the unit into an outlet fairly close to our router. Then after it was on and running I connected my phone to the TP-Link wireless connection. After that I added a password for the extender, then backed out and reconnected to the router Wi-Fi. That was it. The next time I have a moment I will connect all the devices to the extender but I checked their network connections and sure enough, I see the new network option listed and ready to connect to.For reference, our business uses a local/regional provider called All Points Broadband. They use Cambium products, specifically cnPilot routers/access points. Our modem is pretty new (less than six months old) and is fairly reliable on its own. I just wanted to improve uptime to 99% or better.If you are not technically inclined, just follow the quick start guide and this extender is a great, cheaper option to improve Wi-Fi coverage in your home or business.

  I was skeptical when I placed this order and was not disappointed.  The repeater continuously acquires and drops the host signal even when placed within 3 feet of the router.  By the time the WiFi-enabled device reacquires the signal (say, an Amazon Alexa product), the signal drops again and the process repeats.  The Alexa isn't the only device with this issue - my iPad also gets sporadic reception ... again, when I'm using it withinn 3 feet of the extender (and the extender within 3 feet of the router).  I upgraded the firmware thinking that this might alleviate the issue but no change was noticed.  I can't wait to get this back in it's box and returned to Amazon for a refund.

  The quality of the product is good, it was easy to find the app but had a try a few times to get to run on my network. I finally got it to connect on the third try. Only issue I have is when I come home it automatically connects to the extender. I have it plugged in upstairs so that it can connect to it when I’m upstairs in my room which is about 30 feet away from my main WiFi. The extender sits about 15 feet away from my main WiFi making it the halfway point. When I’m upstairs and connected to the extender reception is great and fast. But when I come home and hooks up automically to the extender it tends to be slow and have to go back in my settings to reconnect to my main on when I’m downstairs. Both are set for automatic log in but for some reason it overrides my main WiFi. I will look into it and if I can configure it and figure it out I will update my review.

  I ended up returning this and bought a Netgear WiFi range extender for the same price.  The TP-Link device was a disappointment, as sometimes it worked and sometimes it didn't.  I ended up contacting their Tech support via chat 4 times, with long waits each time.  In the end, we thought a firmware upgrade was the solution, as the version sent by Amazon had older firmware, but I was unsuccessful after 3 tries at getting the latest 2020 firmware onto the device, but surprisingly it updated to a later 2019 version.  Still the device would only provide a WiFi signal for an upstairs PC part of the time.  I also rebooted the unit twice.  Bottom line, I invested a lot of time, and gave up in the end.  The Netgear unit is working much better and in the end, was easier to program.

  Unit installed easily and worked well -- for about 5 weeks, and then the trouble started.

I contacted customer service and they helped me re-flash the firmware.  Unit worked for another week, the failed again.  Contacted support again and got the run-around.  Agent  blamed my wifi router, even after I explained (3 times) that all my other devices worked at that distance and greater, so the fault was in the extender.  Ignored multiple requests to deal with a supervisor, and multiple requests to replace or refund.  Insisted I change the channels on my wifi router, even after explaining I did not have that access.

  I don't often write reviews, but every once in a blue moon, I buy something that completely blows my mind in the best way possible. For context, I live in a separate, walled-off section in the back of a house that I rent, and in my section of the house, there are no modems, routers, ethernet cables, nothing. I had just recently bought a new computer to use at home but found that the wifi would give me, at best, internet speeds of around 20 MB/s and, at worst, <1 MB/s while being very unstable also. However, I noticed that just outside my room in the kitchen, I would be able to get internet speeds of 200+ MB/s. That's when I decided to buy this wifi extender. Set-up is a breeze. I thought I would have had to go ask the homeowner to go to his router, plug in the extender next to the router, press the WPS buttons, etc. This is one way that you could set it up, but it also gives you the option to set it up through your browser or through TP Link's Tether app. I chose to do the latter. All I had to do was plug in the extender into an outlet in my own room, find the extender's name on the Tether app, then choose which networks to extend, and it'll automatically create the extended networks, it's that simple. Didn't have to go through all the hassle of going to the homeowner, especially in this pandemic. Now the extended network gives me internet speeds of 75 MB/s with VPN on, 100+ MB/s with VPN off, while being stable at the same time. This is definitely one of the best investments I've made in a long time.

It's like having the whole house wired for internet.  I even connected it to my old router from Frontier to check compatibility. It worked great, but it really made the cheap frontier router seem even slower and less capable so I purchased a TP-Link AC1200 router and set my frontier router to bridge mode and wow what an improvement! It's a match made in heaven. It is super easy to configure all of the TP products from the app and not have to use a browser. I love it!

  Precis: Gave absolutely no increase in speed and, in some test cases, likely internet variation, showed a 5% decrease in speed.Description: Regional monopoly inhibits choice in ISPs, so the most reliable provider here, at a reasonable cost, provides only 50 Mbps, which typically streams at about 90%.  Forty feet away from the router, down an open hall with a slight bend, with open hallway and office door, are two office computers, one a MAC, the other a PC, both with up-to-date WiFi cards, and both running SSDs, with 32-40 RAM.  Internet speed at this short distance from the router is only 50% of speeds near the router.  The TP-Link, which set up easily, was plugged into an outlet about 20 feet from the router, with a near-direct line to the office.  Absolutely no difference in internet speed.  None.  But the lights on the TP-Link sure make it look professional.

  I bought this to connect our TV to our WiFi. The TV is in one corner of the house and our router was in the other. The instructions seemed to imply that you could just connect it to the router and then move it to another outlet. This was not true for us. It showed us connected to the extension, but we didn't have any internet. Luckily using the manufacturer's Tether app fixed it and we can now stream on our smart TV better than ever.Installation was easy once we had the app.

  We have four people in our household currently working/schooling from home and using the WiFi. Our house is not large but there are a lot of walls and doors, and the bedrooms where my kids use their school Chromebooks have never gotten great reception. I didn't really know what I needed to buy, but the reviews on this extender made me give it a try. It was cheap and such an easy setup - it was working about 5 minutes after I opened the box.

After years of using our iPads to watch movies or having to watch TV in the cold basement, we can now have normal family Movie Nights in the living room.  A few years ago, I had tried the Netgear extender, but it only worked for a few minutes after a crazy and difficult set up. This one was easy to install after I read the instructions, along with a number of Amazon reviews that gave installation tips. I couldn’t believe it when all the lights on this extender lit up when I plugged it into one of my living room outlets.  I had absolutely no hope it would actually work!!  It was a very happy moment for me.  I no longer have to hear moans and groans from my family when we get a TV notification in the middle of a movie saying we don’t have enough wi-fi to continue it.  No more hearing, “Mommy, I HATE this TV!!”, to which I always reply, “It’s not the TV’s fault, it’s the internet!!”

  Before I decided to purchase the TP-Link AC750 WiFi Extender (RE200), I did some research online and read some reviews. I certainly trust reviews from CNET more than other online sites as they are very professional. The TP-Link AC750 WiFi Extender (RE200) was on top of their reviews and with an unbeatable price, there was no say about getting it. I had my 'work from home temporary office' set up in the basement but the wireless signal I was getting from my router, which is set on the main floor, was very weak and the connection kept on dropping quite often to the point of frustration. After connecting this WiFi extender, the signal boosted remarkably and I have not seen any more signal failures. I attached pictures of both the signal strengths for illustration. The set up was very easy and in less than 10 minutes, it was done business. The instructions are very easy to follow. I used the WPS button connection choice which seemed to be pretty straight forward. And if your router is dual band, you can have both signals extended. I have the regular 4G and also 5G and you can choose whichever extended signal suits you better. The extender itself is pretty small and compact. The LED indicators are great and guide you easily. One important thing when relocating the WiFi extender is to set it where it receives a strong signal from the source router. The LED light changes to red when it is too far from the source router. This is a great feature, no doubt!

  We use a mobile Netgear Nighthawk router so it can go with us when we travel.  Unfortunately with that flexibility comes a very small range of signal.  My kids were constantly stealing the router and moving it around the house with them to game and online schooling was a struggle because only the child in the room with the box had clear service.  Not anymore.  One of these boxes solved our problem.  Our router is in a central location downstairs.  This extender is directly above it and easily covers the upper level of our home.  My son downloaded the app and had it set up within minutes.

This definitely improved the signal strength, but I also noticed, like other reviewers, that the internet load speed DECREASED when using this. If you're looking for something to help a device get a better signal, this works fine, but do not expect faster internet speeds. It was very easy to setup though.

  I was getting extremely irritated with my video doorbell which suddenly kept losing connection after 2 years of good service. I decided to try a WiFi extender and this was ranked very highly for value and performance by a third party.So far so good. After 2 weeks, it's still doing what I wanted it to do (maintain my video doorbell's connection). It was VERY easy to set up (though a bit confusing at first because you have to set up a password for the app as well as individual passwords for each extender you install, and remember your own wifi password through the whole process). Everything is done through the app, and the app is very simple to use. You do need to have a pencil handy to jot down all those names and passwords. And when you go to connect a device, you connect it to the extender, not to your wifi,  so that was a little confusing also, and good to know up front. I initially connected my doorbell to my wifi (thinking this product was just a signal booster) and was frustrated it still didn't work, but when I connected it to the extender it worked fine.I really like that you can custom name each extender (upstairs, basement, etc.) so you can easily identify each one inside the app and don't have to remember the product code or serial number.  I also love that there at no parts, no cords, no extras, no need to find a table. This makes it perfect for hallways (like your upstairs hallway to serve all the bedrooms).I didn't give it 5 stars because I can't measure the signal, so I don't know if it's 'strong', I just know it works. Also I don't recommend trying to set this up yourself if you're not petty fluent in smart phone app tech (i.e., don't send it to your elderly parents; go and set it up for them. At 46, I'm pretty fluent and it still had me confused until I figured out what it was actually trying to tell me; that's when I had to go back and redo the whole process and write all my passwords down and reconnect to the extender signal). This is one of those products where the instructions are technically clear, but you need to understand the whole process before you start, it makes the whole thing easier.

Don't ever let anyone get control of your computer. I decided to further investigate on my own. This is when I reset the range extender and was able to set it up with my router. This was necessary because someone had already set it to be used by a previous owner. After setting it up, I was very disappointed in the RANGE of the range extender. It was weak in receiving my router signal, and it was weak sending out a signal. I am sending it back, and will look for a better rated product.

  So far the TP-Link AC750 RE220 Dual-Band WiFi Extender (2019 release) has worked great and suits my needs perfectly.It's small and visually appealing so you don't need to worry about hiding a bulky or ugly device. It actually resembles an plugin oil diffuser like a lot of us might have.  It is very light weight so it shouldn't sag from the outlet when plugged in. You will lose an outlet plug and if that's a problem you can always use an extension cord and put it where ever you want. The front of the RE220 boasts 5 easy to understand LEDs informing you of its status (power, ethernet, WiFi, 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands) and a WPS button. The bottom of the device has a high speed RJ45 ethernet port (this is absolutely golden for wired devices) and a reset button which is recessed so you don't have to worry about accidentally pushing it and ensuring that you have to mean it when you do use that feature. It is supposed to work with any WiFi router. The mobile app and web user interface also give you management options like enabling the High Speed Mode, restricting particular devices for a specified amount of time and it even lets you turn off the LEDs if they might disturb your sleep or distract you. I personally have not used the extra features as of yet but they sound like they might be pretty useful, especially being able to turn off the LEDs. I think everyone has noticed blinking lights from various devices and they can be super annoying if they're in your bedroom or visible when you're trying to focus.The RE220 was very simple to set up with easy to follow step-by-step directions in the box, which guide you through the process and inform you about your options for setup (WPS, mobile app, web UI), where to find the app, a QR code for the app (this is also printed on the box) and the web UI address for setup if you opt to use a computer instead of the app or WPS feature. I chose to use the app which is also very simple which made the process all the more enjoyable. All you have to do is follow the on-screen prompts and it goes smoothly. It has you setup your 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz WiFi bands separately as they each have a password although it's usually the same and it's also true that not all networks are dual-band. I didn't have a single problem during setup. It was quick and painless.The only setup issue I did have was mine. In my haste to get the RE220 going, I didn't rename the extender's WiFi signal to match my home network so it caused conflicts with my IoT devices that were trying to talk to each other because the network is password protected and I had actually created a second password protected network. This caused some communication issues. The instructions even tell you that you may want/need to do this but I was in a hurry so I could get other things done and overlooked that. Once the signal was renamed and the password set to match the original network it worked great and without issue. This was very easy to do within the mobile app but could also be easily done using a laptop or desktop computer.I bought this to solve an issue with a device I got a great deal on. I stumbled upon a used Sony Media Streaming Bluray player for $15. I couldn't believe it and couldn't pass it up. I didn't really need it but I was tired of using my phone or laptop to stream movies and video to my bedroom TV. It was always a hassle and the only alternative was a wired connection directly to the TV and that in itself was a pain and more so if I wanted to play any of the discs that I have since my laptop doesn't have a built-in disc player and I have to connect the USB BR/DVD/CD player. The problem was that the player required a wired network connection and not wireless. I can't complain since it was practically free. I don't know about you but my house does not have wired ethernet. I could do that myself but it's time consuming and the money needed cancels any value in my purchase, in fact, it probably would have exceeded the cost of a brand new media player and I didn't want to make that kind of investment just to get a media player on the network. My TV is a few years old and it doesn't have WiFi or smart apps itself and I'm not ready to spend a few hundred just to get that kind of experience there either. Not when I can work around it for much less. This network extender allowed me to connect the Bluray player to the network using a spare network cable that was laying around from an old printer or maybe it was an outdated gateway from an internet old service provider. Regardless, the cable was brand new in the package and all I had to do was plug it into the TP-Link RE220 extender and my Bluray player and BAM the player was on the network and asking me to install updates. To top it all off, the WiFi signal in my bedroom is much stronger and everything using the RE220 signals have a much more reliable signal. That's not to say my Arris Gateway didn't give me a good signal to begin with, it's just a stronger signal.The speed of the TP-Link RE220 AC750 WiFi Extender works great for watching Prime videos in HD. I get full 1080p just fine. There is always a loading delay but I think that's the player which is a few years old so the memory and processor speed is not top of the line but it was $15 so again I'm not complaining. If you plan on watching 4k Ultra video, you may want to do some research to see if the TP-Link RE220 AC750 WiFi Extender meets your needs speed-wise, but it claims 433 MBps for 5 GHz and 300 MBps for the 2.4 GHz bands which should be fast enough but it's not GigaBit speed for sure. I don't have a GigaBit speed router so it wasn't a concern. My TV isn't 4k Ultra capable so I didn't worry one bit about it. I did notice that when I watched a movie using the Amazon Prime app on the player, it checked the connection speed and displayed the result and it's exactly what I see on my Samsung Galaxy S9+ on the home WiFi so the RE220 does not seem to be slower than the Arris Gateway my network is running on to begin with and the only speed issues I ever see are when too many devices are simultaneously using too much bandwidth (multiple HD TVs, cell phones, laptops, remote set top boxes, etc). First world problems...am I right? The only solution there is a faster internet connection and router which hasn't been necessary and saves money and even if I did upgrade I think this WiFi extender would still suit my needs.

  Works well, but the latest version of the firmware actually removes the option to disable broadcast of both wireless networks.  We actually use these only to provide a WIRED connection in an area currently only served by wireless.  So, we don't actually use the wireless ""repeater"" option.  In previous firmwares, you could turn off both 5ghz and 2.4ghz repeating -- so that it did not broadcast an SSID at all.  That way, you could use the wired ethernet port without re-broadcasting WiFi if you didn't want to.  In the latest firmware, you can only turn off 5ghz OR 2.4ghz, but not both.We've worked around it by turning one off and hiding the SSID of the second that has to stay on -- but we'd rather have the original functionality back to be able to disable both.

  I have a very consistent issue with this device. Every once in a while, I am unable to connect to internet. And I have to reset it or unplug it to make it work.Sometimes. My Desktop and phone work, and at the same time my work laptop don’t have internet. Or the other way around.And I need to take another reset and unplug ordeal again.Every time I reset it or changed it’s network name, I need to pair it up with all my smart devices all over.The technical support team told me to move it closer to router.  The problem persists. And worse than that, the WiFi range gets diminished.  The speed is slower.I live in a basement. The router is right on my upper floor.The original speed I got when I had it in my room was 80 mpbs.After I followed their advice to put it closer to router.I only get 2 bars of signal strength down here.This device really suck.

  I am very pleased with this TP-Link product as It works flawlessly and without any problems. The software is very simple to operate and to setup and configure the device which in my case is the TP-Link AC750 WiFi Range Extender. I live in a 2 Story 5000 square foot house and this TP-Link extender has brought GREAT WiFi signal to every phone and computer in the house and a really nice feature is after you have configured it by your router you then unplug it and use the app and keep plugging it in to different dead spots away from the router until the application tells you to Close to the router or To Far away and that is a Great Feature for discovering the best possible spot for it's placement to work at it's best and to top that off the TP-Link company emailed me persnally to ask about my experience with the product which is also to me a Great part of a company with Great Customer Service. Thank you TP-Link. A Completely Satisfied Customer.

  This is a common problem I see in wifi extenders, especially the cheap kind, but this one worked great for like a solid two weeks, then suddenly stopped doing its job. It was weird. Good thing it stopped working within the return period cause that's exactly what I did. I returned it and invested in the Google Nest Wifi router and points. I waited for a Costco sale or amazon sale and got it for a good deal. The Google Nest Wifi router and points have been working GREAT.

  We purchased this extender to give us better coverage in further out areas.  It reaches those areas with no problem.  The issue is that it constantly drops the wifi signal.  We have to unplug and replug at least once every 24 hours to reestablish our internet connection.  Amazon has been no help in getting another unit and sent us to the manufacturer which of course is no help either.  If you're looking for reliable internet, this extender isn't going to be the one for you.

  Not much of an extender. I am trying to get coverage 100' from existing router. After multiple tries at different ranges, had to locate extender about 50' from existing WiFi for it to connect at all. Now have great WiFi where I already had great WiFi. Very marginal improvement where I needed it. Now add the pita of having to switch WiFi networks for a slightly more solid connection. I have a WiFi security camera over 120' from existing router, it connects no problem but the extender could not. Guess they are using cheap low gain antennas in the extender.

  2 stars because it does work, but doesn't really help much due to it's limited range. My main router is the TP-Link Archer C9 (the white one), which has very good range. However in my garage, the signal is not as strong as I liked for my security camera. So I was trying to improve that with this wifi extender. Using the extender makes the situation worse; now there are skipped frames in the video live stream. So I just unplugged it and not use it because I was too busy to deal with it. Now I finally have some time to play with it again. I tried using it in access point mode just to test its range. At about 20 feet away through a couple of walls, I am only getting speeds of  around 1 Mbps, compared to the full speed of 170 Mpbs for my main router at the same distance and location. Unfortunately it's now past the return period. There might be some limited situation where I can make use of this device in access point mode, so I'll just hang on to it.

  Prior to buying the TP-Link AC750, I was not sold on WiFi extenders as they never worked as advertised. The TP-Link AC750 is an exception to the rule. The setup wasn’t as fluid as I liked as many of the set up options did not work. I was thankful for all the suggested set up options as a few didn’t execute. My extender was placed in a room approximately 50 ft. from my router and obstructed by several walls. At first it seemed that the extender wasn’t transmitting a strong signal. After about 5 minutes, the signal solidified and the results have been as if I was next to the router itself. This is an inexpensive and solid product given other connection alternatives. 4 stars.

  This works pretty well for me, but I did have to try it in 3-4 locations before I found the best one.  Very easy to install.  But what they didn't say was:  1.  If you have 2G and 5G like I do, set the extender to 2G.  Also, on my iPad, under ""wifi connection,"" I realized I had to set it to the Extender (listed as wifi 2G ext).  Without that it wouldn't work right.  Once I did that, I was fine.  But if you have a big house you might want to get something more powerful.

  So I really, really wanted to like this product. I use a TP travel router when out on the road for secure WiFi in the hotel and hoped I would be as pleased with this product. Actually bought 2. One for my workout room at one end of the house, where I stream with a Firestick TV and one for the opposite end of the house where my wife steams her YouTube videos. The side of the house where my wife watches receives a Medium signal, with buffering while watching videos. I get a much better signal my side, but with the occasional buffering.So upon receipt I only opened one device and set it up. Was moderately easy to set up, but there were some challenges that had to be overcome. Primarily with the TP network. Regardless I got there.When fully up and running went down to my wife's end of the house, plugged into the wall outlet about half way to her room and linked up  with her Chromebook. After settling down the signal went to Medium, to Very Good then back to Medium. The thing keeps going back and forth randomly. Tried it on 2G and 5G. The 5G seems to work best, but again it stays mostly at Medium signal strength.Attempted to gain a possible better position by plugging into an outlet in her room. No difference. Strong light signals on the unit, but not really any better signal strength than when not using the Extender.So, took the unit to the other end of the house and tried it. My exercise room is about the same distance away from the router (located in the middle of the house up high about 7ft.), but upstairs and above it. Signal strength without the Extender is Very Good, with the Extender..... Very Good. No difference. On the Firestick I'm able to cycle between the 2G, 5G and 2G Ext and see the signal strength. All three show the same signal strength.Based on what I've observed so far it looks like I've wasted my money.

    Don't buy this extender! It does not reach 5GHz speeds! Please read my review.
  
",1.0,Saad E.,"Reviewed in the United States March 15, 2020","









  
  
    
  This review is regarding the TP Link AC750 (RE220) ""New Version""ORDERING AND RECEIVING THE DEVICE:Okay so I have connectivity issues with some devices in my home and if you are reading this, you most likely have the same issue. More specifically, I wanted to connect my PS4 to a 5Ghz network extender via Ethernet cable for faster download speeds as the original PS4 only supports 2.4 Ghz. I ordered this extender because it states that it is dual band and supports 5Ghz frequency with max speeds of up to 750Mbps as the description states. That being said, the box states hat the max speed (5Ghz) is 433 Mbps? Right, that's the first clue.SETUP:This part was very simple and straight forward. TP Link has an app which makes things very simple to setup. I had no issues navigating the app and setting up the extender with my home Wi-Fi. The device also has a WPS button for quick connection to your home network, but I can’t comment on that as I didn't use this feature for the initial setup. After setup I updates the firmware as I always do with all devices I initially setup. The firmware version I am running as of this date is: 1.1.1 Build 20191024 Rel. 48180.TESTING SPEEDS:Here’s where things go to crap… My home router is only about 15 feet away from the extender. The signal strength is at full bars. I tested the AC750 extender for both 2.4Ghz and 5Ghz. Moreover, in the TP Link app, under “Tools”, It shows an option for “High Speed Mode”. The descriptions is as follows: Router-to-Extender in 5GHz only and Extender-to-Client in 2.4GHz only. My professional background in IT work immediately triggered my IT senses. At this point it’s more then a tingle. I performed multiple speed tests. Tests were performed with the “High Speed Mode” on and off. I performed speed tests on both the 2.4 GHz and 5GHz frequencies.  The results were very poor. Fastest speeds achieved were under the 5GHz frequency at 70.1Mbps. Each test was performed 2 times to ensure that the speeds were generally accurate. I then performed speed tests on my home 5GHz network for comparison and to make sure that the network was functioning properly. I have taken screen shot outlining all my findings. Please see the pictures attached to my review.CONCLUSION:Do not buy this extender if you are looking for a fast 5GHz extender. This is not the one to get and you will be thoroughly disappointed. TP Link is misinforming the public by marketing this device as being able to reach speeds of 750 Mbps. It doesn’t even come close. As stated above, the highest speed achieved was 70.1 Mbps. So, do yourself a favor and don’t buy this extender.

This IP-Link device has an app called Tether, that makes setting it up a breeze.  I read all the positive reviews and am so glad I bought it.

  This product was shipped fast and arrived as expected.  Thanks to the WPS feature, set up was very easy and fast.  I let the unit sit in an outlet near the router for roughly 5 minutes before engaging.  From pressing the WPS button, it took roughly 4 minutes to connect, set up and for the light to become solid.  Once moved to the middle dead zone area and plugged into an outlet, the xxxx_ext network signal was quickly established.  My distantly located device (outdoor camera) found the signal and began working again (re-establishing the network connection using my original network password was required).The signal strength is not '5 bars' (did not measure actual speed) but sufficient for the application required in my case.  Happy with the purchase.

I then plugged this up in one room over from my router and I get 50% signal with 10 Mbps down. I then tested it all around my home in different locations and found that my router actually reaches farther than the Extender will. This unit is advertising a maximum of 750 down on the 5ghz band and I can't get no where near close to the speeds I get without it.

  This is a good extender with a good range. The ability to have it direct traffic the way you want (5G from the router to extender only then 2.4G to the devices only) makes it really nice. Drawbacks are you cannot configure which wifi channel it uses. TPLink says it will use the same channel as the router but that's BS. Mine is stuck on channel 2.OneMesh is garbage. Rather than simply mimicking a single network it uses a specific protocol that individual devices have to support. Your Echo speaker group will not work! It also causes lots of latency as devices seem to constantly switch between connection points. It's really crap. Don't enable it.

  It's easy to install, if you use the Tether app you should be aware that you are giving away your router details, and password etc to TP-link. They can snoop in your network if they want to, and/or if they get hacked then your network too. Now coming to installation setting, you can choose a new SSID if you don't like the default router SSID-EXT format for the extended network, but the password remains same as your main router access password (very unlike other extended routers like Netgear etc), this is a very big issue if you want to create guest network.Now about the speed, the extended network is less than half of the main router whether you choose 2.4 or 5GHz.Cheap and easy to create a extended Wifi zone by sacrificing speed, zone separation (guest) and privacy..

  It took me an hour and a half to realize that I had to disable MAC filtering on my router because this thing did not give me the MAC address of the Wi-Fi signal.

I then entered that MAC address into my router’s allowed devices, re-enabled MAC filtering and everything seems to be working OK. And as others have noted this is not necessarily a direct repeater because it creates its own network with your original network suffixed with an _EXT.

  Like the other reviewers, the basic setup is super simple - I was able to get it connected at 2.4G (802.11g) pretty easily with the one touch WPS setup, but using the same setup process to connect to 802.11n and ac modes over the 5Ghz spectrum didn't work, even with the extender right next to the router. The WPS light kept flashing and eventually timed out with no 5Ghz signal. Not a problem, had to login to the interface via the built in webpage and connect to the 5Ghz hotspot manually. But in the end, I ended up disabling 5G on the extender to router side because it was actually slowing the connections down because the 5Ghz band has a harder time going through walls than the 2.4Ghz band. Overall, this range extender works as well as one can hope for the 22 dollars it cost. Was able to expand the indoor range of the router's signal by at least 50 feet in a brick, wood and stucco house.

  It says very clearly I can use the same Wifi SSID and password with the OneMesh feature as the router I'm connecting to to extend the signal.  It also says it will work with any router which is true, but I can't use the same SSID.  It just appends _EXT to the SSID I want to connect to and creates a new one.  So the advertising is not fully clear on the fact you also need a OneMesh compatible router to be able to use the exact same SSID/password.  My router is not.  Now I have to buy a OneMesh compatible router.

  This product works great. This allows my laptop to get full connection as if i was next to the router. I recommend this product to anyone that has a dead zone in their house. Even though this product is great i honestly recommend you look into a mesh network system. A mesh network system is a better  range extender.Instead of putting multiple range extenders in your house and having 6 wifis’ , it would be better er to get a mesh network as it works better then a range extender and its only 1 wifi that is all over your house that way you don't have to connect and disconnect to different wifi connections but instead have one for your entire house with no dead zones and full data. So my final verdict is if you just need a quick fix a range extender is the way to go but if your installing more than 1 in your house then it would be better to just get a mesh network as the multiple range extenders would ld get confusing.

  I received the product within 24 hours - Great. The WiFi extender comes with 3 different ways to connect you your router. I had some issues and contacted tech support. At first I was impressed but then I was connected to a foreign tech support person who wanted to remotely log into my computer. He then said I had problems because I lacked a firewall (not true) and then wanted $200 to ""fix"" my computer. I just disconnected from the remote login - SCAM. I went back and tried the Android app one more time and suddenly it just worked.The WiFi extender picks up my home's signal and rebroadcast it in both 2G and 5G on different channels named the same an my home network names but with EXT added on the end. This makes it very easy to know you are connecting to the extended WiFi channel which is very helpful.Now that I have it working, I really love the product. But beware of the company's tech support if they try to charge you to fix your computer.

  Wow!  I opened the box, followed the instructions and 10 minutes later, I'm rolling.I bought another item on Amazon from Boss for $50 and it said ""plug and play"".  Well, not so much on that one.  This one has great instructions, including using an app called Tether, which works great.  You simply plug the small device into a plug near your router and connect through the Tether app.  Once you set up that connection, bring it to another location where you need a little boost.  For me, my router is upstairs near our home office and bedrooms, so we put this device downstairs.  After it finds its connection near your router, you simply have to bring it to the other location, plug it in and wait a couple of minutes.  All lights lit up for me and I am now connecting my downstairs devices to the EXT networks, which are listed separately.I was so nervous after the $50 repeater extender failed to work, but you never know.  This $30 one looks nicer and works great.  I am using Motorola MG 7700 modem router upstairs if anyone is interested.  I don't think that would make a difference.

  So my router (TP Link Archer 7) is at one end of our home for reasons I don't need to get into.  While the router has great range, I would occasionally drop my signal to my PC at the other end of the house, and my wireless printer often had no connection.  Using the Tether App, I was able to install in about 5 minutes and have a great connection to both my PC and printer.  Speedtest showed NO LOSS of download speed, as this is a dual band extender, and will use one of the bands to give you wonderful coverage and download speeds.  I was ready to spend money for a mesh system, but for under $30 this was a great alternative for me.

  My router is in my living room. I purchased this product in hopes of getting faster internet speed in my bedrooms. Before and after setting up the product I conducted several speed tests in all of my bedrooms. I determined that the speeds were significantly slower when using the WiFi extender. The only place that made a difference was in the farthest corner of my house in the garage. The speed went from 35mbps to 70 mbps. In the bedrooms the speeds went from approximately 240mbps to 100mbps. Maybe I misinterpreted the product and it is more geared for larger houses to extend a little bit of WiFi signal to true “dead zones”. Maybe it isn’t intended for smaller houses to increase speed. For that reason I’ll give it a 3.

  Not a bad product as it does extend the range of a wifi signal and it is cheap. Installation was not hard but seemed more problematic than indicated in the how to videos and the quick instructions provided seemed to lack some important steps. It does repeat the signal and extend the wifi but you need to find the right spot for your situation in order to maximize the effectiveness. There are some general guidelines on where to place the device but I seem to be getting only a small extension of range (6m). All in all, this does help and is a good product but not a great one. Given my experience with this I would probably look to getting a booster of my signal or rewire my network so that I would have more ethernet ports around the house to plug other devices into.

  I bought this WiFi extender because of my positive experience with the TP Link AC1750 WiFi Router, which I loved due to its strong WiFi coverage in my house. The WiFi router was on one side of my house, my study room is on the other side so signal strength is not Ideal but not bad. With this WiFi extender, I tested internet speed multiple times, with multiple devices. The WiFi extender actually contributes NOTHING to internet speed and even SLOWED DOWN my speed. Returned it the same day I got this. People, if you really wants to know if this one works, you need to test your internet speed.

  The product is excellent. It works for places where internet hub is distant and needs signal boost. It was delivered in 2 days and I think that was simply remarkable. We have a very powerful internet hub and distance was not our problem. The signal weakens as we go to the third floor in our house. This product provided me 30-40 MB/SEC on the third floor but the wifi router itself was providing similar through-put. I guess, there's a significant speed loss when there are in-between devices. We figured, we are okay with what we have. We receive over 200 MB/SEC on the second floor. The wifi is in the basement. But I have nothing less than satisfactory to say on the product.

  I needed a wi-fi booster upstairs in our master bedroom and the kids room for the Cloud Cam. Our router is on the main floor and opposite end of the house so our bedroom was a deadzone and the kids room had a weak signal, camera would go out frequently.A bit of a pain to install/setup the network the WPS button set-up didn't work so I had to go the App route but once I did that it was very easy from there. So learn from me and download the App, don't bother with the WPS button thing.Signal is now great upstairs, only caveat is that sometimes you have to manually select the EXT network from your device settings, my phone will only auto-connect if it loses the main router signal. My advice is to sit near the extender and connect to both EXT networks -- I have a dual band router so i have 2.4 and 5G networks -- since you'll have to put in the password to your wi-fi when you first connect. But then your device will remember the new networks and you can switch between them pretty easily. Sometimes I can even go back downstairs and stay connected to the EXT network it's that strong!So if you are an average guy like me that just wants a decent signal in some rooms that are far from the router, this is a good product, you don't need to break the bank if you aren't too concerned with overall speed and stuff...so I don't think this would be the right extender if you do a lot of online gaming.

  I ordered this wifi extender and based on previous experience with TP-Link I expected it to be hassle free. I was wrong. I tried to set it up multiple times with 2 different extenders and both times it did the same thing.I was able to get through all the steps for set up. But when it then tried to re-connect me to the extender (after the networks were created) it couldn't. I would either get cannot connect to network or network password incorrect errors (even when entering the same password).I contacted support and all they did was walk me through the process a couple times. They were literally no help at all. My guess is that the extender has a problem with a special character in the password. My router has a special character in the password and when setting up the device it sets up the slave networks to have the same password (and you cannot adjust that). However when you first start setting the extender up it asks you to set up an admin password for the device. You cannot, through the app, use a special character. So I think the device doesn't know how to handle that. But support was at a loss to explain it. It's the only reason I can think that both devices would fail but my Ring Chime extender can connect just fine.

  I definitely have mixed emotions about this particular extender.I purchased it to replace my old Netgear Extender that pooped out, & the main selling point was that you use an app to manage it rather than having to go through all the web address connection BS that I was used to with the Netgear device (major anxiety inducing headache).Setup was easy enough and quick, but for whatever reason, it had issues finding the device and didn't ""stick"" so I had to set it up a second time right after finishing connecting the darn thing the first time *facepalm*, so maybe not so quick and easy lol...Anyway, since the initial issue during setup, I haven't had any problems with managing the app.The signal and speed seems decent. I have CenturyLink so I wasn't expecting any miracles as far as improving loading speed and whatnot. There might be a little bit of a speed increase as far as loading pictures in emails on my phone (I get daily emails regarding discounts on ebooks lol), but I'm not tech savvy enough to notice anything major.I'd really like to give this product 4 stars, but there's one key factor I'm not happy with. The signal dropping... The extender will drop signal multiple times a week. When I go to look at it, all of the appropriate lights are present, but the signal cannot be found by my various devices (phone, tablet, laptop, Firestick, etc). Admittedly, it's an easy enough fix, just unplug the extender, give it a few seconds, then plug it in again, & it only takes the time for me to walk from one end of the house to the other to power on and work again. However, it's still inconvenient and annoying.Overall, it's a decent enough device, but the constant signal dropping is a pain in the kazink. Do with that what you will.

  After purchasing and successfully putting into service a TP-LINK AC1750 WiFi extender, I had high hopes for this AC750 WiFi Range Extender.  The AC1750 had easily connected to our home LAN using TP-LINK's Tether app, and then easily connected to the various devices that were in the area where I wanted to extend WiFi signal.No such luck with the AC750.  I should have been warned when, even after setting the AC750 less than 2 feet from our router for setup using the Tether app, the AC750 could not ""see"" either the 2.4 or 5 GHz signal from our router.  I directly connected the AC750 with an ethernet cable to the router and completed setup that way, but it fought me all the way to connect to the 5 GHz signal.  After disconnecting the AC750 from the ethernet cable and placing it where I wanted to extend WiFi signal, the AC750 will not connect to ANY device in that area: it won't connect to our cell phones, it will not connect to our WiFi devices or switches - in other words, the AC750 will not extend the WiFi signal to ANYTHING because it won't connect to ANYTHING.Furthermore, the AC750 constantly disconnects from and drops off the Tether app, making it impossible to revise any of the settings that might possibly address the connectivity problems this device obviously has.I will be re-boxing this item and returning it to Amazon - a WiFi range extender is only good it it works, and this AC750 doesn't work.LATER EDIT:  When I unplugged this range extender to return it to Amazon, the range extender was HOT to the touch!!  No LED lights were showing - quite obviously, this unit was defective.

  After a good deal of research, I landed on the TP-Link AC750 WiFi Extender to help boost my internet signal. I have a computer in my home office which is located two rooms away from my modem/router. We live in a home with plaster walls which means there is a metal grid behind the plaster on each wall. This metal grid extends from floor to ceiling the entire width of each wall and it restricts the internet signal from traveling from room to room.When the TP-Link AC750  arrived, I decided I would plug it into an outlet in the living room between the family room where the modem/router is located and my home office. After a fairly straight forward easy set-up, I was pleasantly surprised that the new extender was registering a strong signal from the modem/router. Once I found the TP-Link in my list of internet connections on my computer and made the wireless connection, it has worked flawlessly over the past several months.I have been extremely pleased with the quality of signal I now get in my office; no more dropped connections, which used to happen on a daily basis. For the investment, I don't believe you can go wrong with this wi-fi extender.

  Not worth the postage to ship it.  Had it sent to our vacation home, didn't arrive until 5 weeks after purchase due to COVID.  Set up using the TPLink.  A trip :-( would be ok for setting up IF the extender worked.  If it doesn't as this one didn't, its a pain to reset, reset, reset.  You get the picture.  It picked up the signal we wanted to extend, both the 5 and 2 G (they were showing 5 bars) HOWEVER it wasn't capable of resending the signal.  AT ALL. EVER.  This extender was sending a red signal (nothing) for transmitting or extending.  The 866 number to call wasn't a valid number, etc. etc.  Have owned router extender and used for years. This one is capable of picking up router signal from maybe within 50 feet, as far as transmitting= forget about it!  TOTAL RIP OFF!

  Ordered this range extender to boost my signal upstairs. My modem is only a year old, so I didn’t want to buy a whole new system to setup a wireless mesh network (which is the better option). The extender is easy to install & can be set up by anyone. I was hoping to plug it up in the hall, but the signal was too weak (it has a signal strength detector on the app). I plugged up closer to the modem & I connected fine. So far everything is working fine. Definitely recommend if you need an inexpensive range extender!

  I set this up with ease the day of delivery but noticed no apparent strength of signal in the back room of the house. Today, I happened to notice I had two network names for my home network, the original one plus one with the same name but with an ""ext"" after it. I connected to it and, lo and behold my signal increased from two bars to between 4 and 5.  The problem I had been having getting a good, strong signal was gone and downloads and connection to the internet was much better. The only caveat about this extender is the lack of clear instructions in intelligible English plus the assumption that everyone has a smart phone to download their app onto. Much clearer instructions are needed, eg., need to wait a bit after pushing the buttons to connect to allow it to acquire a signal, etc. All in all, a good product which should work well for the price.

  I'm not NOT tech-savvy, but always seem to have a nightmare of a time when setting up our wifi or changing out routers.  So, I was kind of dreading this after reading some of the reviews for the 2018 version of this product.  To my delight, the setup could not have been easier!  It took all of 5 minutes and we were up and running with our extended network.  We did some remodeling last year and added a LOT of natural stone, granite, tile, walls, etc. where there previously had been carpeting and an open room.  These materials drained the wifi connection we get in the new areas, and  the wifi range extender has brought that back to life.  We're excited to see if this helps to extend our signal onto the front and back porch, too!Very pleased so far.

  After getting fed up and frustrated because the wifi didn't reach upstairs (sheet rock from 1918 blocks all signal even cell signal) I looked all over for the best extender and this one came up at the top of every list (there's a newer version, but even the 2020 lists show this one as the best) I ordered it and when it arrived, I struggled to figure out how to connect it to the router because the app refused to accept the password or perhaps the Log in. I used the button on the modem instead so it's connected to the modem not my router. (I think the modem has a built-in router feature, but I am not tech savvy so I have no idea) I had to use a power strip and hold the extender directly next to the modem (this is important so make sure you can get them super close to each other to connect) Finally after struggling with it for about 10 minutes it connected. I left it in place for a few more minutes just in case. Then I brought it upstairs and plugged it in. It took maybe 5 more minutes to have the proper lights lit up before I could connect the Fire stick and the Xbox to it. (It comes up as the name of my modem with EXT after it) I was a little confused as to how to connect because it needed a password to connect to it. The password is the same as my modem. I connected it and after 5 years of living in this house with sketchy wifi that cuts out in the middle of movies and games, I have signal upstairs and it doesn't suddenly cut out. I can finally watch an entire movie on the firestick  without having to come completely out of the app I'm using and log back in to finish the movie. I wish I had bought this years ago. Had I known it would be this easy I would have installed one the day we moved in. We connect our phones to the wifi when we get home and I currently pay for 50mbps and speed tests show up to 150 mbps, which is amazing. The photo with my review is the speed test I just ran. It is over 50 mbps for downloads and uploads. This was worth every penny I paid. I have fiber internet with a Xyxel modem and a lynksys router.

    The 2 Year Warranty Is A Bust
  
",1.0,6enuine1,"Reviewed in the United States December 14, 2020","









  
  
    
  The TP-Link family ""was"" what I usually purchased when I had network installs that needed extenders or for my own personal use.  (I have purchased 5+ in the last 2 years) As a tech, I needed something dependable and this was the only brand I trusted.  All of that changed when I purchased one for a client in June of this year and it failed.  Not only is it only 6 months old however, when I went online to replace it, the site wasn't user friendly at all.  So I used the chat feature, and told the first support specialist that I was a tech and not only had I reset the extender 3 times and ran the wizard but, I had also used their knowledge base to no avail.  It would connect but everything would give me the error no internet or poor signal.  She wanted to take me through her own companies ""PD"" (problem determination)....ok, I get it.  What made thing difficult is she would and continue to leave and come back. After 4 mins the system would warn you it would time out.  After 1:10 mins of going back and forth and telling her I already did that, she asked me to hold on yet again and took so long, despite the fact I kept typing I am here to keep the chat open, it timed out and closed. Very frustrated now, I called and told the 2nd specialist all I had done and also the previous tech Rosetta, and this imbecile wants to start the process all over again.  Their attempt is to frustrate you until you considered it a lost.  Needless to say, I reimburse my client, tried something new and returned the two TP-Link USB wi-fi adapters I just received which falsely showed on the box, big as daylight, ""2 YEAR WARRANTY""  The product ""was"" good, but if the company does not stand by the warranty it so boldly highlights all over its product, then it isn't worth pockets with holes in it.

  While this device does give you greater WiFi coverage once it’s set up, the setup isn’t as smooth as I’d hoped.I downloaded the app to set up things, but the app refused to send me an email to create my account.  Then I moved onto the manual method.  I have a dual band router so I had to go through the sync process twice, but the unit’s light didn’t inducate the sync to the 2nd band worked.  After repeating the process a few times it eventually sync’d.Just not as smooth as expected.

    Not reliable, Poor tech/warranty support,
  
",1.0,retired engineer,"Reviewed in the United States June 30, 2020","









  
  
    
  We live in a track size two story house that is not large.  The dual band router provides good wifi but the signal is a little weak (not a dead zone) in one corner of the second floor.  After reading the reviews I bought this unit to improve the signal in that corner, I liked the WPS method of installation and the promised  24/7 phone support.  I installed it quickly and it worked for 6 weeks. Then one day the iPad and phone said ""no internet"" when attempting to sign into the -EXT wifi networks for both bands. The iPad and phone could sign into the slightly weaker wifi signal from my router in that corner of the second floor. I called the phone support but it is not available (COVID 19? but I thought Asia had recovered).  So I went on Chat, spent 1 hour and 20 minutes, response was  slow, several restarts, location changes but the problem remained.  Then I tried email.  They said I should use the Tether App method of installation etc.  Again several resets and Setups. Sending photos showing the unlit 5G led light, 3 -4 email exchanges.  My perception is that tech support people are overworked, undertrained and basically cut and paste scripts to respond to you.  They don't have time to read your emails completely.  Finally I asked to replace the failed unit under the 24 month warranty.  There was no response to that.  I bought the unit in May and it failed in June.  I finally gave up and returned the unit with 20% restocking charge.  So my conclusion: Unit is OK if it works but warranty/Tech support is poor.

  Product offers no benefits in extending the wifi signal strength or range. I needed to extend my range to go thru an outside wall 22 feet from the router. The router signal at the propesed location of the outside camera unit was-82dbm, too weak for a HD  camera. I followed the instructions to place the extender 1/2 the distance. At 11 feet with direct line of sight, the extender showed it was out of range, but the router signal at that point from the router was -62dbm, plenty adequate for my printers, etc. The signal from the extender on the outside was -101dbm, worse than the router's signal of -82dbm. i tried a nuber of ways to make it work, and the TP help desk had nothing else to offer than what i had tried. I even had a professional look over what was done and tried several different techniques to work, none enabled a good use for this produuct. Product was returned.

  Update after about 50 days: I was using this adapter just fine then out of the blue it just stops working. The wifi part works fine, still get internet, still connect to main network, but the ethernet port off the extender stopped working. It'll blink like it's connected, but I can't access network locations and I have no internet. I was in the middle of a download when it stopped working, so it's not a software issue. Pretty sure it's the ethernet port on the extender itself because it's extremely loose fitting. Went back to my netgear extender I bought 6 years ago and it works fine.This tp link is trash.Original review:So after an hour of frustration I finally got this thing to work by using Google.If you want to use this to connect a device to your wifi via an ethernet cable (like, if you have a computer that doesn't have wifi) then listen carefully.When you go through the setup process, the last page says ""connect to the network and verify the internet is working."" Here's the catch: if you check the box saying it's connected and working, IT WILL DISABLE INTERNET ON THE ETHERNET PORT!You'll get all the network functionality (seeing other devices, able to transfer files and such) but NO internet access.Once you get to that page, simply close your browser. Do not pass go, do not collect $200.Even still, there's something screwy about the ethernet port. I disabled the 2.4ghz connection, disabled the 2.4ghz extender, and still I get 2.4ghz speeds.On the phone with wifi, connected to this extender, I'll hit 190 Mbps download. On the computer I get 85-95 Mbps

  I received and installed this device yesterday.I used the WPS button on the router and the corresponding WPS button (with 2 arrow symbols) on the TP750 to link these devices.Installation of a new TP-link model TP750 Range Extender seems to have resolved the WiFi portion of network problems I was having in this condo unit with interference from other devices in the building. (There are still intermittent problems with the Comcast service, which any range extender can't touch. )The network name through the device is <router-SSID>-5G_2.4GEXT for my office computer. The device apparently receives the 5G signal and then makes it available at 2.4G for devices like my computer which cannot receive 5G. (The full router SSID has the ""-5G"" suffix to indicate that it is the 5GHz signal.In my wife's computer she can select <SSID>-5G_EXT because her computer can receive the 5G signal.Performance is notably better with this device.Note: Because my receptacle is horizontal, the device is installed horizontally and apparently works just fine like that.I recommend this device.

  Do not waste your money! This would work if you only had a small space and you wanted to boost the WiFi . I followed all instructions, the router is about 1,000 ft from my room, so I placed this thing about 500ft in between. It took a while for it to connect and it was a little confusing but easy enough.I don’t understand why it’s not working, my phone shows it connected to the “EXT” network and it shows full strength on my phone but I can’t open a webpage. I’ve tried moving the extender around to a couple different places but no luck with any of them. My laptop and Xfinity box are all connected to the main router just fine, it’s only my phone that can’t connect so I know the WiFi can reach that far, this extender was just to give my phone a little boost which it did not. It changed the WiFi status on my phone from 1 bar to 3 bars but still no internet connection. Wtf.

  I really love this sexy little wifi extender.  It is a sleek design, and has a lot of nice features, such as being able to name the wifi and control the unit.That said, it has a very poor range.  I was using it to extend my wifi to the garage.  I already had an old extender there which worked well, but I liked the features this one had.  First off, it would only let me place the extender about 20 feet from my ""whole house"" router.  Secondly, unless I put it in the center of the garage, it will not reach any devices.  I tested the signal with my phone and 20 feet from the extender the main router 2.4g signal was slightly better than the extender signal. I may have to send it back.UPDATE:  The seller (Jane Conley) emailed me and offered me $40 to remove this review.  Original item was only $24.  I said NO WAY!  That would circumvent the review process.  Therefore I decided to return the item.

If this fails, I will ask for a refund.Set up is super easy.  Plug it in near your modem, hit the WPS on your modem, then within 2 mins. hit the button on the extended wifi.  Wait, which can take up to 5 mins for all the lights to come on.  Unplug and relocate it to where all lights light up again.We live in a one story house, 1250 sq. ft. and I have it located in a straight shot from the back of my home to our kitchen.  If I place it around the corner, say closer to a bedroom, the wifi extender will not work.This was mainly purchased to extend the wifi to a bedroom with a TV.  If I close the door in the bedroom, the signal diminishes tremendously.Seems to only work good if it is in a straight line with no walls or appliances in the way.Not impressed with it.

  Setup was pretty easy with my existing router. It seemed like a few too many steps and reboots to finally make it happen, but ultimately it worked. The wifi strength in the back yard was vastly improved...strength that is. It seemed odd that I had a strong signal, but the usability of phones, computers, security cameras, etc. was not great. I changed the extender to be ""high-speed"" which means it communicates with the router in 5GHz but will all devices downstream in 2.4GHz. No improvement. The main router started doing weird things, too. The usually highly-reliable internet connection was being flaky. Even my desktop PC which is hard-wired to the modem/router from the cable company had no connection. We rebooted things and mentally blamed the cable company. The next morning, I picked up my phone off of the charger and found that it had no throughput despite having a signal. I found that it had grabbed the extender instead of the base router/modem. I unplugged the extender from the wall and in some seconds emails and notifications began flowing in after my phone grabbed the base router. I dug the box for the extender out of the recycling bin and promptly submitted for a return via Amazon.

  UPDATE (read original review below if you want context)I really wanted to like this, and I did at first. It worked amazing...for about a month or two. Now when hooked up to it, wired or wireless, I get frequent disconnects. This is solved by unplugging it, and plugging it back in every 30 minutes or so. This is very annoying as you may imagine. I'm not sure if cheap hardware is going into this device, but I suspect that is the case. I am really disappointed in this product. I recommend you buy a more well-known brand, such as Netgear or something comparable. I won't be buying another product from these guys soon, and I'm going to go ahead and knock off 3 stars for this.~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ORIGINAL REVIEW:Like the title says, you really can't beat this product at this price. This is how I set it up.- Download their app, hook up the device to your wifi- Name your new wifi from the device itself (I named it the same as my old)- Then, plug it in to the wall near your computer/laptop/console etc- Finally, I plugged an ethernet cable to the bottom of the device and ran it directly to my computerThis was netting me significantly closer to my advertised network speeds (went from ~20mbps on a 5GHZ Wifi band to over 140mbps over ethernet, with my advertised speed being 300mbps). Not perfect, but it's WAAAAAAAY better and I couldn't be happier.I tried using it without the ethernet cable, just using the device's wifi signal, but there was no significant change in speed.DEFINITELY UTILIZE THE LAN PORT AT THE BOTTOM FOR MAXIMUM PERFORMANCE.

  I was skeptical about buying a DUAL BAND wifi extender for less than $30 including free two day shipping with prime... After a set up process that had to be followed precisely and took about 20 minutes, I plugged this unit into a kitchen wall receptacle... It picked up the signal from my Comcast DUAL BAND router that is in a different room, and it pushed out a strong signal to another room separated by two walls and metal doors. I really didn't think it would work considering the distance and all of the walls the signal has to go through, but it did, and now I'm getting a strong, uninterrupted signal for my smart tv, laptop and iPhone three rooms and multiple walls away from my Comcast modem. I do have to switch networks when using this booster to ensure I'm logged into it (noted as ""ext"" network) and not my Comcast network.

    Intermittent WIFI drop out
  
",2.0,Hamid R Eghbalnia,"Reviewed in the United States January 16, 2021","









  
  
    
  I have had this product for a few months.  I purchased it because of the reviews and my personal experience with other TP-Link products.  We started experiencing wifi dropouts shortly after adding this device to our network.  Initially I thought that it was because of the router, so we replaced the router with a higher-end product from TP-Link. After a few months of ""detective"" work, I noticed that the drop out happens when the unit heats up. Customer support agreed to exchange it but they wanted me to send the unit back (my expense) and wait until they ship another unit, which meant being without a repeater for up to two weeks.  I replaced it with another brand and all is okay.  I don't recommend it because I think the ""heating"" problem is likely to be common to this line of product.

    Did not extend full WiFi Bandwidth Speed
  
",1.0,Shane Ramsdell,"Reviewed in the United States July 16, 2020","









  
  
    
  The booster extended internet to an area of the house that did not have consistent internet, but the speed was 1/8 of the advertised bandwidth speed.  The product boasts that it will extend the 5.0 GHz band at 433Mbps.  I get between 250 and 375Mbps in the spot where I placed the booster.  The extended WiFi from the booster had speeds between 50-75Mbps.  That is not nearly enough for internet working nor video meetings.

    WiFi Extender Works!
  
",5.0,Mike F.,"Reviewed in the United States March 29, 2020","









  
  
    
  Although I saw a lot of negative reviews, I purchased this WiFi extender because it was a good price and I checked other websites with reviews and overall this extender does pretty well for customers.It took about 10 minutes to get it going.  I was disappointed I could not connect using WPS only.  But, I re-read included instructions and followed them to hook up the extender. I also downloaded the Tether app and will use it for settings and updates, etc. when needed.We have a 2400 sq. ft house and the extender is about in the middle.  We get 3 bars throughout the house now and 2bars clear into the backyard.It is a good price and so far works as advertised.  I recommend it for anyone who needs better WiFi coverage for a budget price.

    Easy to install; great for products that need WiFi on the other side of the house/garage

  I’ve bought different brand WiFi extenders where the reviews claimed they were easy to install AND effective. Most were wrong.This extender is both easy to install and is effective.I have a WiFi connected garage door opener, but the garage door opener wouldn’t connect (something I should have thought about before I fell off the ladder and broke my arm trying to install it, but I digress) so I bought this bad boy and I now have full service WiFi in the garage (and a casted arm).Definitely recommend.

    Ok for the price, but just get a mesh instead

  I had an ok signal but things would often take several seconds to start loading or they might lag out in the middle.  My router is on one side of the building next to my computer and most of the wifi devices are on the opposite side 50 feet away through multiple walls.  After adding this extender halfway in between this happens much less often.Before buying any product I read the negative reviews because I know they can be incredibly serious or they can be minor.  For this one I noticed half of the poor reviews had a really terrible signal and this didn’t help them much.  It can’t salvage a disaster, you stil have to have a good router but with limited range.  The other half it didn’t seem to do much at all and even interfered with the existing signal.  Maybe that’s a compatibility issue, or I dunno why, but it looks like if I had that problem I would usually know right away and otherwise I’ll be fine.  A couple reviews about privacy seem to be misreading the terms.  It’s hard to make sense of the huge document, but it doesn’t say at all what those reviewers say it says.  At least not at the beginning as one says.  The beginning only describes what info you may or may not voluntarily give to tplink (everything you type in), not what they might do with it.Signal will still cut out at times, a few times in the past couple months.  Just now I had to reboot it (unplug, plug back in) to get any signal at all.  By comparison my main router needs a reboot every 2-3 years.  It would be better to save yourself the frustration and blow the money on mesh wifi.  With all the time spent messing with a bad signal it will be well worth it in the long run.  That’s what I ended up doing and it’s way better.  High speed, almost no loading time, strong signal, never dead.  Still the extender did help quite a bit and it's really cheap, so I can only dock 1 star for only being a band-aid solution for an insufficient router.

    Doesn't make a difference

  I have used this product since I got it and wanted to have a good idea about its effectiveness.  Last night I decided it just wasn't providing enough, if any, benefits.  Tried to return today and found that yesterday was the last day to return.  My own fault.  You can benefit from my mistake however.  I have used in my 2 story home for a month (and 1 day) and just don't see any benefit or increase in signal over not using it.

    Extender is connected to router but no longer putting out internet signal
  
",1.0,Lucy,"Reviewed in the United States January 21, 2021","









  
  
    
  I installed without any problems. It worked just fine for about 2 weeks. Then the connection started dropping every now and then for about a week. And after that it stopped working completely. I spent hours reading online reviews and watching youtube videos. I reset it a several times but nothing worked. Extender is connected to the router, all lights are green, but it's no longer putting out internet signal. My laptop and phone show connected to the wifi but there is no internet. At this point I just gave up.
